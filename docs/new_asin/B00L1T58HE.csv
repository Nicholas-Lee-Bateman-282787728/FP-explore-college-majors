6459784,5,B00L1T58HE,"I am not an athlete, just someone who's been into fitness for many years. As I'm getting older, I'm finding some of my regular workouts are getting uncomfortable in the joints for me--these are mostly Tony Horton and Zumba. The first time I did this workout, I got up from the floor and felt like I was gliding instead of walking; it really was amazing! I then did my regular workout with increased comfort and stamina. Unbelievable. The one thing I will say is: start slow, watch the workout before starting to do it, and don't feel like you have to get anywhere near Kristina's extension in order to get the benefits. As she said in the workout, you should say and do kind things to your body--(maybe that's not an exact quotation, but it's the idea), so don't push it and don't go for pain. I got immediate results with a very gentle adaptation of the moves and will not expect to get even close to her bendiness any time soon, if ever!",1409097600,35,939,4.402298850574713
6459785,5,B00L1T58HE,"I absolutely love this DVD, my favourite bit is that you really don't need to warm up before hand which if you are like me and are pushed for time you don't lose precious minutes which could be spent stretching. Really relaxing and at the same time you know you are getting an amazing stretch which is benefiting you with that next day ache! If you are looking at improving your flexibility I would recommend this 100%",1409097600,5,418,4.441558441558442
6459786,5,B00L1T58HE,I love Kristina! Her DVDs have really helped increase my flexibility and open up my hips. I've never been able to do middle splits without experiencing a lot of pain. And within a couple weeks of doing her videos I was able to middle split no problem! Highly recommend.,1409011200,4,269,4.510204081632653
6459787,5,B00L1T58HE,"I really love this workout - the pace is ideal for me, and, even though I don't stretch as much as I should, I noticed a great increase on my flexibility by using this DVD. Also, it seems to be making my knee pain go away - I suppose it's because the muscles around the knee are getting stronger and it gives more support/stability to the joint. (When you're used to the workout, you can also try it with ankle weights.)",1409011200,12,420,4.197530864197531
6459788,5,B00L1T58HE,I absolutely love this DVD! It is a great supplement when I cannot make it to her classes or workshops. Her instruction and knowledge of the body and limitations is phenomenal. She offers a very safe and effective way to increase flexibility and strength! A must buy!,1409011200,,267,4.702127659574468
6459789,4,B00L1T58HE,"I really enjoy this DVD due to the clear instruction and good range of stretches. Sometimes I use it as a full workout, or only do parts if I don't have time. When I want an even deeper stretch I pause the DVD after certain exercises and add more things (such as bridges and splits), or hold poses for longer, before continuing. So I think it's a good DVD for people of all levels of flexibility.",1409011200,3,396,4.223684210526316
6459790,5,B00L1T58HE,"I've always been very inflexible and I was concerned this would be too challenging for me, but I love this DVD. Every stretch feels very thorough, but you're eased into them gently. For the first time I look forward to stretching.",1407715200,3,230,4.634146341463414

i was looking for a trainer for a long time and since i living far away its the closest i could get to training with her.
fun, easy to follow, and very detailed so you can really learn how to work with your body with out hurting it and actually make it happy and healthy.",1458000000,,376,4.094594594594595

(All at home) nothing has helped the pain on my entire left side like this video. The cueing is amazing! Certain poses I have done before but didn't realize that I was doing them wrong & stretching the wrong muscles! I totally recommend this video! I can't wait to order Get Bent!",1445472000,13,383,4.408450704225352
6459806,4,B00L1T58HE,"So far I like it, but this one is no joke, she really gives a good stretch and some of the moves were really hard for me. But the good news is that I am taking it as a challenge to really get into the stretches more. She is extremely flexible so you cannot really compare yourself to her, but all in all she gives a really intense stretch.",1443657600,10,339,3.927536231884058

I increased my activity level about a year ago and the imbalances became very frustrating. This workout is helping restore balance and I feel a better mind body connection. Kristina is very personable and I catch myself repeating Kristina-isms outside of practice (like, ""Muscles love a good jiggle."" :)).",1440547200,3,406,4.985294117647059

6459810,5,B00L1T58HE,"Every time that I use this video, I learn or notice something new. The video helps me stretch consistently and pay attention to form. Compared to her other DVD (Get Bent), this is focused on strengthening those muscles that you seldom use at your office job but are super important in becoming more flexible. I purchased both and use both. The atmosphere of the videos are what I wish more yoga videos were like -- calming and without big egos.

The video tires me out by the end, but makes me feel refreshed and realigned. Thanks, Kristina Nekyia! I recommend this video to everyone who is looking for a good stretch or to become more flexible!",1435104000,13,645,4.560344827586207
6459811,5,B00L1T58HE,"About me: I was once told that the first thing you lose as you age is not your aerobic endurance or your muscle strength. It's your range of motion and flexibility. So, I decided that now that I'm over 30, I should work to make my body more limber. As a bonus, doing a stretch workout makes me feel good about myself without the work of a ""real"" workout. There are plenty of yoga workouts that serve to increase flexibility, but I find them to be too easy / boring / too much pressure on wrists / or too repetitive. It's surprising that there aren't a ton of non-yoga stretch workout DVD options out there. I wound up getting Bendy Body and Lastics, but I find that, a month or two into it, I prefer Bendy Body and rarely do Lastics.

Here are a few of the reasons why:
1. Time Commitment: Lastics doesn't have chapters. Lots of people complain about this, but I thought it wouldn't be a big deal because I could fast forward, etc. In the end, I don't have the patience for that, and I rarely have the time to do the entire video, so I pretty much always reach for Bendy Body.
2. Repetitiveness: I find Lastics to be really repetitive -- tons of standing, bending over, straightening knees. Tons of time spent on hamstrings. Bendy Body does a good job of pacing - loosening a muscle well and then moving on.
3. Inspiration: When I do the Bendy Body video, my husband will see the stretch Kristina has and exclaim ""That's insane."" I definitely can't get anywhere near Kristina's backbends and won't be able to any day soon (if ever), but seeing her do something truly amazing on screen while explaining how to get there is really inspirational. Lastics feels much less ""wow"" in comparison.
4. Personality: Neither instructor has an annoying personality. However, Kristina has this sultry-secret-seductress but down-to-earth-approachable thing going on that is mesmerizing.",1429920000,57,1871,4.635542168674699
6459812,5,B00L1T58HE,"I just love this exercise video!! I have worked out for so many years (yoga, Pilates, kickboxing) but this work out truly helped me.  It stretched me more than yoga and I felt it deeper than when I do Pilates or kickboxing. I wish I could give it 10 stars.  I have back, neck, shoulder and hip problems and this DVD has done wonders since the first day.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1427673600,11,391,3.9871794871794872
6459813,5,B00L1T58HE,"I have always been very flexible, but in recent years, had become a bit stiff.  I follow this guide 3-5 days a week, depending on my schedule...If you follow these steps, and practice consistently, you will gain flexibility.  I have progressed tremendously, and it has helped with my yoga practice immensely!",1424217600,4,308,5.019607843137255
6459814,5,B00L1T58HE,"Really fun DVD! If you are interested in increasing your flexibility, this is a great way to do it. Probably not for the very beginning student of flexibility training. But if you are used to stretching, this will quickly help you to increase your range of motion. She warms each area up thoroughly before stretching, and you feel a couple of inches longer after you finish. This has been a great addition to my DVD collection.",1421452800,6,427,4.631578947368421
6459815,5,B00L1T58HE,"I love this dvd!  Every time I do it I feel weirdly exhilarated, and I am seeing results in less than a week!! Not only in my flexibility but also in my posture, which is so nice.  For reference, I am insanely inflexible and very slouchy person, but I have an easy time strength training.  My terrible flexibility and slouchiness caused back pain after my first child, and this dvd has done more than months with a chiro, so for me absolutely worth the $25.  As for how much of a work out this is, I definitely sweat and am sore the next day from this, but I had a second child 2 months ago and am just getting back to exercise after quite a hiatus, so if you have been doing something other than nursing for the past few months you may not find it as intense as I do :D

Also, if you find the moves a bit difficult a hot shower first helps a LOT.",1420243200,10,847,4.017857142857143

6459817,5,B00L1T58HE,"I have been doing the bendy body workout every day for the last 6 days and YES Ive seen already results! (:
In detail, i started my flexibility journey the last 2 months, the most of my training was very long hours of passive static stretches (3-4 hours a day) and an hour of hand balancing and yoga.. My flexibility increased but not dramatically!

I reached out to Kristina, because she trains contortion to adults and fitted perfectly for my needs! She recommended me the bendy body in addition to get bent in the beginning, because the active flexibility would strengthen my muscles in order to be more relaxed and flexible!

In one week of doing the active flexibility, i gained some flexibility, BUT if it makes sense, my body when it bends or when i'm doing my passive stretches it feels more grounded, i have a greater sense of balance and stability and now i can feel what i'm stretching! Intentionally i can stretch my middle or upper back! In the beginning i was just crushing in the lower back with no middle, upper and shoulder work!

At last i'm opening the front of my hips!! Yay! my hips are the tightest part of my body :/ i couldn't get near to front split without feeling that i could broke! now i'm doing the front split of my left side quite good and my right side needs a little work but i'm getting there! And i thought that passive stretching was the way.

I will write another review one month from now, so i can have space for improvement!",1417824000,25,1465,4.4148148148148145
6459818,5,B00L1T58HE,"Brilliant Dvd.
Have a 20+ year background in the physical arts and arrogantly thought I knew all there was to know about stretching.
Kristinas' dvd has proved me wrong.
There is nothing here that is completely new to me but the sequencing and the brilliant explanations have been game changers to me.
At the end of the dvd i felt more flexible than i have for ages.
Most surprising of all is that the stretches are all presented in a very safe and mechanically sound way.
Have incorporated Kristinas' methods into my daily training regime.
One of the best instructional videos i've seen, highly recommended.",1417564800,6,607,4.79047619047619
6459819,5,B00L1T58HE,"Love! Love! Love! I am a figure competitor who loves pole dancing and I like to nail those tricky, bendy moves. Because of my weight-lifting I'm constantly tight and afraid of hurting myself. I started contortion training about a year ago but recently moved and don't feel safe training on my own. Kristina's video is for beginners and more advanced flexibility students. I have to add that her little butt slaps when she's telling you to target your glutes make my day!!!",1414195200,10,472,4.7682926829268295
6459820,5,B00L1T58HE,"I absolutely love this DVD! Clear instruction and easy to follow.

6459821,5,B00L1T58HE,"Love it! I bought this video after emailing Kristina which one should I get, ""Bendy Body"" or her first video ""get bent"".
She said this one is most likely best for me (lower back issues) b/c there is a back release in"" Bendy Body"". I really Love this video and workout it is my favorite next to Rachel Brice's ""Serpentine"" DVD (yoga & Bellydance)
Kristina is a excellent coach and talks through each stretch and her teaching style is very good as she describes what you may feel (Pinchy) and she doesn't try to make you do more than you ought too. Although I'm not a beginner to yoga or bellydancing anyone who has any issues, knees, back etc should prob work with this video before using ""bendy body"" which is more advanced. This is a REALLY good vigorous workout! It I found her blog and video on Bellydance (dot)com. I would recommend this video for all dancers, people who have some structural  issues, yoga people,weight lifters, even a beginner if they take it slow could do this b/c she doesn't let you go beyond your limits, of flexibility.",1409443200,33,1047,4.5396825396825395

Video quality is simple and clear and effective.  I would describe the atmosphere created by Nekyia as simultaneously ""frendly and all-business,"" and the business is, of course, flexibility and well - bendiness.  Do this for a couple of weeks and you will see results.  Do it for a month and become bendy.",1518134400,,479,4.72289156626506
8663131,5,B00L1T58HE,"Good stretching DVD. I like her instruction; she gets you into a position and then has you stretch some unexpected area so you get a better stretch than you normally might. I don't do the whole thing at once. Don't forget she is a contortionist, so her positions are extreme.",1516924800,2,275,4.52
8663132,5,B00L1T58HE,"I am a yoga instructor, and my yoga practice has certainly made me more flexible over time, but I am NOT someone with much pre-existing natural flexibility.  I am always looking for alternative methods of stretching that will enhance my yoga practice.

I had tried a previous DVD by instructor Kristina Nekyia that I liked,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shoulder-School/dp/B019PHXN4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shoulder School</a>, although as the title of that DVD would suggest, it specifically addressed the shoulders.  I have had Bendy Body on my wish list for some time, and I finally purchased it.  In her introduction, Nekyia talks about how this DVD goes through three different types of flexibility:  1) passive stretching, 2) resistance stretching through contracting and releasing (also called PNF by others), and 3) active stretching via using your own antagonist muscles.  She states that the third method is the main focus of the DVD.

The DVD Main Menu includes the following segments:  Play Bendy Body - Introduction - Stretching the Legs and Hips - Releasing the Lower Back - Opening the Shoulders - Backbends.  I have described each of these segments (and given approximate times in parentheses) below.

STRETCHING THE LEGS AND HIPS (41.5 minutes)
As I moved through this segment, I was surprised that it went on for so long!  In terms of the exercises, that was fine, as Neykia includes some great moves here, but this initial chapter comprises over half the workout, so I wish it had been broken up into smaller chapters.  Neykia begins with reclined hamstring work using a strap.  These moves will be familiar from both athletic stretching and yoga, but she adds many little twists such as pulses, contract/release, and internal/external rotation.  Next comes a variation on Figure 4 stretch with the top leg in the air, taking this leg through a series of dynamic movements.  Continuing on the back, Nekyia performs various lying straddle stretches.  Seated calf work is follows.  Neykia then moves to a kneeling position for a very thorough and unique series of hip stretches, addressing the external hip and hip flexor.  She starts with work designed to address the external rotators and help move towards middle splits, then moves towards rear leg lifts, focusing on what she calls the ""downstairs butt"" to release the hip flexors.  From a seated mermaid position, she works on the hips/quads, and then she finishes with more hip flexor work in a kneeling lunge position.  At the end of this segment, my entire hip and pelvic area felt WORKED.

RELEASING THE LOWER BACK (6 minutes)
This was a nice segment that I would have loved to be a bit longer.  Here Nekyia is seated in a butterfly position, and she adds forward bending and twisting to this position to release the low back.

OPENING THE SHOULDERS (12 minutes)
My right (dominant) shoulder tends to get particularly tight, and the work here felt good!  Nekyia starts standing with some neck stretches.  She then works to attain range of motion in the shoulders in ALL directions.  At the end of this segment, she uses a strap with the arms over head, continuing to stretch the shoulders while also getting in a side oblique stretch.

BACKBENDS (8 minutes)
This segment also begins standing.  Nekyia works on opening the upper back, eventually moving towards a back extension in cobra pose.  The finally work in this section is done kneeling (similar to camel pose in yoga) and working on the upper backbend in this position; this is supposed to be a preparation for a standing drop-back.

Overall, I really liked this DVD!  It gave me exactly what I wanted--i.e., an effective, thorough, intense full-body stretching program that would enhance my yoga practice and other activities.  My only (small) complaint is that the first section is not broken up into smaller chapters, as I know I personally would use the shorter segments more often.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend this DVD.",1511222400,5,4015,5.118279569892473
8663133,5,B00L1T58HE,"No one here mentions, and she doesn't say it in the introduction on the DVD, but you need a ""flexibility strap"" for this work out. I'm telling you now, so you can order them at the same time. BUT, I really do enjoy this workout, much more than the standard yoga themed flexibility videos out there. Somehow, it really makes you feel good, and avoids the stress on your wrists, ankles and knees like I have with yoga (now that I'm larger).",1510099200,10,438,4.353658536585366

8663135,5,B00L1T58HE,"I have both Get Bent and this DVD. Both of the DVDs are very different from one another. I like this one because you work out your muscles in order to be able to hold and strengthen your flexibility on your own. I like Get Bent for conditioning your muscles to stretch further without working them too much in order to be able to lengthen your capacity. I enjoy them both and use them throughout the week for flexibility building.

The exercises in this DVD are a lot more intense in that you are working out your muscles more. You are not only lengthening your stretches, you are conditioning your muscles by building strength to be able to bend or stretch that way without strain or pain. I like some of the back bending exercises in the Get Bent dvd better, however, I have noticed that my back muscles are sore after the back bending exercises in this DVD which means I must be building my back muscles to hold the stretch better.
I like the leg exercises in this dvd more, as they are more intense than the get bent dvd, so I could feel the difference. After doing all of the exercises, my whole body was sore the next day. I could feel which muscle groups were worked well, and I am happy to say that it felt like my entire body was worked well, so I know this must be doing good things. Overall, I am definitely happy with my purchase and am happy I have both DVDs. Next is shoulder school :)",1478995200,18,1399,4.2593984962406015
8663136,5,B00L1T58HE,"Great to build your active flexibility. It is tough, the first few times I did it I was really sore in places I had never been sore, like the outside of my hips.

Not a stretching DVD either. There is a section of backbends, but not splits.",1467590400,,420,4.613333333333333
