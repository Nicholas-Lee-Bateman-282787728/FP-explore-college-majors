8619076,5,B00FWXE12S,"What can you say, it's the Tour de France.

Over the years they've pretty much gotten the coverage methodology down well enough. There are some stages I'd like to have seen more of. The breakaways on the flat stages where the young guys are let loose to fly instead of break the air for their team leaders. But it would add a lot of time that wouldn't add anything to the results.",1394236800,,380,4.277777777777778
