1235769,4,B00000JNVC,"This is a great early Hitchcock film.  The suspense is great.  The editing and cinematography are classic Hitchcock.  The opening of the movie is great with the jump cuts and the montage squence of the London blackout.
The film hits very close to home in this age terrorism.  Although it takes place during the years leading up to WW II.  It is very appropos today.  The saboteur uses a boy to carry a bomb which goes off on a London bus.",1080777600,2,438,4.345679012345679
1235770,5,B00000JNVC,"Wow! This DVD has amazed me. I am an avid Hitchcock fan and have been interested by Sabotage's reviews for a long time. One day, while browsing the Alfred Hitchcock DVD Infomation Site ([...] I came upon this DVD. I was stunned. One of the DVD's had Sabotage and The Lodger on the same disc! I was also interested by The Lodger. I went to the amazon.com site and started reading some reviews. One review mentioned that the DVD was worth getting for its price alone. I scrolled up the page, and behold, this DVD was selling brand new for 7.99$! I ordered it immediatly. Here are some reasons why I advishe you to get this DVD.
1. GREAT MOVIES: This goes without saying. Sabotage and The Lodger are two of Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks. Even if you are not a Hitchcock fan, you will still enjoy these movies greatly.
2. PRICE: 7.99$ is one of the cheapest prices you will find for DVD's.
3. PICTURE QUALITY: Sabotage has its faults in the Audio/Visual departement, but for a movie that is approaching its 70th birthday, it has great picture quality. I have rented some other DVD and VHS copies of it, but this is by far the best. The Lodger is not quite as good, but this movie is approaching its 80th birthday, so I will not be harsh.
I highly suggest that you should get this DVD.",1065744000,,1281,4.409282700421941

""SABOTAGE"": The Criterion Laserdisc is sharper and smoother with clearer sound than this DVD.
""THE LODGER"": There is a Japanese Laserdisc that is much sharper and less choppier than this DVD.
Even better, watch the 35mm restoration of ""THE LODGER"" on the AMC cable network, complete with color tints.  Why this version has not appeared on DVD yet is a puzzle to me.",1046217600,5,470,4.662650602409639
1235772,5,B00000JNVC,"In reviewing these classic British Hitchcock DVDs from Laserlite, I review the film transfer more than film itself...
...of Sabotage, I can say little more than what has already been said of the film. It's an excellent Hitchcock thriller about a young woman who suspects her husband may be a saboteur after a rash of London sabotages leave him missed at home. There's a wonderfully suspenseful and controversial segmant in which a young boy is riding in a bus with a bomb. One would be hard pressed to find anything that the Hotchcock could have done to improve upon this film.
What really stuck with me after this viewing of the film, however, was how brilliant the transfer looks! Laserlite got the gray-tones and contrast level so well, the audio soundtrack so spotless, the cropping so perfect, that one would be tempted to think that Laserlite either copied this straight from the Criterion laserdisc then remastered it again, or that someone at Criterion lost their job, found an original 35mm negative and got hired by Delta, because this is one unbelievably pleasant viewing experience! I do not recall one scene in which I couldn't see what was happening because of bad contrast, I do not recall one moment of hissing on the soundtrack, I do not recall even one missing frame from the movie, no heads are cut off by bad cropping and whites are white, grays are gray, blacks are black and silver are even brilliantly silver. I think it is safe to conclude that, as of the writing of this review, there is not a better copy of Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage available on DVD. Even Criterion will be hard pressed to upstage this one (that is, if they ever get around to reissuing their Hitchcock laserdiscs on DVD.) It's too bad that not every Laserlite DVD can be this incredible, expecially films like Secret Agent, The Skin Game and Number 17 which are lesser knowns that Criterion will probably never get around to releasing (nor would they be expected to.)
As for the added features, this DVD includes a very beat up copy of The Lodger, Hitchcock's first suspense film. I've only ever seen one other copy of The Lodger which was as bad or worse than this one. From what I understand, there is only one good 35 mm. copy of The Lodger available for a good transfer, but it's being held by a British museum and low budgest companies like Delta (Laserlite) do not have to budget to rent the film for a proper transfer to DVD and/or restoration of the film. So, these low budget home entertainment companies must use the same terrible 16mm print of the film. Conidering the circumstances and the fact that this is just an extra bonus, I won't be harsh on it, but it must be said that the Laserlite folks weren't as disriminating with the canned musical accompaniment as they should have been. Certain scenes which are suppossed to be tense and suspenseful have playful music playing behind it ruining the mood that I'm sure Hitchcock intended. Also included is a forgettable trailer to one of Hitchcock's later films and an intro and wrap-up to the film by Tony Curtis which, presumably, is intended to make you feel like you watching a classic move channel of some sort.
Overall, I would have to say this is the best Laserlite DVD so far.
5 Stars to Hitchcock for his wonderful films, 5 stars to Laserlite for an incredible entertainment package.",1044316800,8,3350,4.679661016949153
1235773,4,B00000JNVC,"(Please note that the DVD edition I am reviewing is the Lasterlight release double feature of Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE and THE LODGER.  It's the one with that groovy introduction by the collarless cardigan-wearing Tony Curtis, who does not wear his strange, black leather gloves in this particular Laserlight introduction.)
The viewing of this DVD was the first time that I had ever seen either Hitchcock's SABOTAGE or his silent feature, THE LODGER.  Since this was an extremely inexpensive DVD purchase (as part of a three disc set), I assumed that there would be one fairly good film packaged with one forgettable dud.  So, when I finished watching and enjoying SABOTAGE, I deduced that the second film on the disc would be the one that would be awful.  Surprisingly, THE LODGER turned out to be almost as good as the first film.  This is an excellent DVD to purchase if you are unfamiliar with either of these great movies.  The picture and sound quality are not perfect, but for a budget release, they are quite acceptable.
SABOTAGE is a masterful piece of work.  It has a straightforward, yet engaging plot that will keep you spellbound the entire way through.  There is some genuinely surprising material contained here, and if anyone tells you that a film from the 1930s can't shock anyone in the 21st Century, you merely have to show them this film to demonstrate how wrong they are.  Although the film seems predictable at times, there are moments that will surprise even the most cynical of viewers.
The action is fast and the tension is thick.  The acting from the leads is quite excellent, with particular mention going to the main villain of the piece.  Although the identity of the saboteur becomes obvious almost immediately, you'll be mesmerized watching the characters as they attempt to arrive at the same conclusion, and wondering if they can solve things before it's too late.  Also of note are the family of foreign agents in the bird shop, and the wife who's torn between the truth and the man she married.  This film is worth viewing even if just for the dangerously playful interaction between the main characters.
The picture quality on this film is certainly watchable.  There may be better prints out there on more expensive discs, and I wouldn't claim that it's a particularly crisp picture; if you are fussy about the quality of your DVD, then you might want to give this disc a miss.  But for what you pay, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase.  On the other hand, the sound quality isn't terribly good either.  This is unfortunate, as there are a few lines that are spoken quietly enough to be lost.  This wouldn't be a problem, if the Laserlight people had put English subtitles on the disc.  It's strange that English is not included, as they do have subtitles, in Spanish, Chinese and Japanese.  Of course, this problem only affects the first feature on this disc, since the second film is a silent movie.
THE LODGER is also a class film, and makes a great addition to this disc.  Given the age of the film, it's not surprising that the picture isn't in terribly great shape.  It's in much worse shape than the first movie, though at no point is it completely unwatchable.  Laserlight has released worse looking DVDs before (stand up, MR. ARKADIN) but this is definitely not one of their clearer products.
While the image quality is relatively poor, the quality of the story itself shines through.  It's a thrilling story that contains several more experimental sequences than I was expecting to see.  The movie is slightly repetitive and at times it goes over the top, but this is merely to increase the tension.  We know, more or less, what's going to happen (apart from the very silly conclusion), but our interest is piqued by how we get from step to step.  It's a fascinating journey.  It's just a pity that the ending to the film seems to come out of nowhere.  Apparently, the studio management forced Hitchcock to end the film in the way it does which explains why it feels so out of place compared to the entire lead up.  Despite the disappointment and let down of the ending, the beginning and middle sections are excellent and exciting, and they more than make up for relatively poor resolution.
Considering the low price, this DVD is a great buy.  These are two great movies that belong in everyone's collection.  There are some problems with the picture and sound, but for the price you pay, you definitely get value for your dollar.",1013644800,30,4487,4.742268041237113
1235774,5,B00000JNVC,"In 1926, a new British director generated significant audience and critical interest in his film inspired by the Jack the Ripper murders a generation earlier and of some significant stylistic similarity to the Germanic style of filmmaking that was dominating horror cinema at the time (cf. Cabinet of Dr Caligari; Nosferatu; The Golem; The Student of Prague etc.) In Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger, Ivor Novello plays a new resident of a boarding house who comes under suspicion when a series of murders occur in the same area. The Lodger is sometimes injudiciously dismissed by horror fans, mainly because of Hitchcock's pioneering and (then) original central conceit (which I will not identify because it'll give too much away - but if you see it you'll know immediately what I'm referring to). Those who love The Lodger can however make a strong case for its lineage in the genre, starting with Fritz Lang's M (1931), through to Roman Polanski's The Tenant (1976). Interestingly, Polanski - another great genre director - inverts the premise fifty years later, telling the tale of an outsider (a Polish expatriate) who leases an apartment in France. In the case of The Tenant, it is the lodger who becomes increasingly suspicious of the other tenants, believing not only that they had diabolically conspired in the murder of the previous tenant - an alleged suicide - but were doing the same to him. The Lodger remains a timeless, well-told tale that provides a surprisingly resonant preview of the visual trickery that would eventually make Hitchcock the maestro of horror suspense auteurs. But wherever you stand on The Lodger, the 1926 arrival of Hitchcock as a creative force working on the fringe of the horror genre is in any case an important moment, given the revolutionary entries he would later contribute to the genre proper (most notably The Birds and Psycho). THIS DVD EDITION IS DEFINITELY NOT THE VERSION TO GET THOUGH. Even the VHS is better.",981417600,6,1960,4.996941896024465
1235775,3,B00000JNVC,"As you can probably guess from the title of my review, the entire 3 stars for this DVD is for 'Sabotage'. This print of 'The Lodger' should be consigned to the garbage can where it belongs - it is totally unwatchable.  This is such a pity since 'The Lodger' is easily Hitchcock's best silent  work. There are at least two better prints available, one of which is a  newly restored version that is amazingly good even on VHS, so get this one  instead (I own a PAL VHS copy). Picture quality for 'Sabotage' is  mercifully very good. Hitchcock was really getting in to his stride with  'Sabotage' and the film contains the infamous scene where a young boy, an  old woman and a dog are sitting on a bus next to a bomb. The bomb slowly  ticks away and at 1.45pm .... well, I suggest you see for yourselves - and  as this is one of Laserlight's budget DVDs, you can afford to as well.",962064000,7,878,4.2727272727272725
1235776,1,B00000JNVC,Both of these great Hitchcock films were recently shown on AMC. I did a comparison of the AMC broadcast to the DVD. The DVD fared poorly compared to the beautiful prints presented by AMC. The jacket of the DVD claims that  these were made from the best available sources. Perhaps they mean the  sources available to them as obviously there are far superior prints  available. This is a waste of DVD's great picture quality potential. These  are films in the public domain that I am sure will be done right when the  authorized versions come out (which I am guessing will be the versions seen  on AMC).These discs are not even worth the inexpensive price.,961459200,8,654,4.643478260869565

7912957,3,B00000JNVC,"The late suspense and thriller director Alfred Hitchcock (okay, okay, the late Sir Alfred Hitchcock since he pursued that title all his life) produced some genuine genre classics like Psycho and The Birds. But not all his work, especially his earlier work when he was as interested in framing a mood or doing clever cinemagraphic shots as scaring us half to death, reached that level. The film under review, 1936s Sabotage, in a case in point. Frankly, the plot is plodding, the dialogue is stilted and the characters are if anything rather wooden. And while there are plenty of mood-creating facial shots and crowd scenes and some nice camera tricks this is strictly second-shelf Hitchcock.

Let me make my case. The lights go out, the lights in 1936 London which causes a certain initial panic although the plucky British wind up laughing about this modern inconvenience. However this caper was no accident since it had been touched off by a foreign agent, Mr. Verloc (Oscar Homolka), who is using movie theater ownership in the heart of London as a cover. The country that Verloc is working for is not identified but it does not take too much imagination to assume that in 1936 that country would be Germany as the war clouds were again beginning to form in Europe. Of course if the idea is sabotage, here to put fear in the civilian population, then laughter is not what had been expected by the agent who was handling Verloc. So another, scarier, caper would be necessary to do the trick, bomb planted somewhere where it would cause carnage and put that desired fear into the hearts of ordinary citizens.

But whatever the foreign network Verloc was working for Scotland Yard was on to him, had him covered by one of their top dog agents, Ted Spencer (John Loder) working undercover as a grocers assistant next to the theater. As the plot thickens Ted tries to see if Verlocs wife (played by Sylvia Sidney) is involved in the plot so he takes her and her brother, Stevie, who is living with the Verlocs above the theater to dinner. She checks out clean. Along the way Verloc is making his preparations, connecting with a bomb-maker to do his dirty deed set for the Lord Mayors Day, a day when there will be throngs around town. A lot of the film is then set on the figure of Stevie who, Verloc being thwarted in his efforts to carry out the deed himself, becomes the sacrificial innocent lamb who will carry the bomb to its destination. The bomb goes off on a bus killing all, including Stevie. Mrs. Verloc is beside herself when she finds out Verloc had set Stevie up, had committed the deed, and kills him in a moment of anger and disgust. And she will go to prison as she is filled with remorse over her murder of her husband and tells Ted to take her in. End of story.

Well not quite end of story. See, two things happen to let her off the hook. First Ted in the process of getting to know her has fallen for her and is ready to stake all on them getting away, a not unusual cinematic and literary devise when love-smitten cops have to put their loved ones in gaol. Second the bomb-maker to cover his tracks goes to Verlocs apartment to recover any evidence (especially a bird-cage, complete with bird, he had sent along the bomb in). But the cops are on to him. Cornered, he blows himself up with what today would seem an eerily current bomb-jacket thus destroying all the evidence of Mrs. Verlocs crime. And the chastised pair set of into the sunset, or rather fog. See what I mean. The only guy who plays to form as a bad guy is Verloc who looks sufficiently like a primitive bad guy to do such evil work. Fortunately old Sir Hitchcock will do better as he goes along.",1427846400,,3681,4.50748502994012
7912958,1,B00000JNVC,"The audio was so poor on this addition that it could not be heard when the monitor or TV volume is turned up as far as possible.  I do not recommend the product at all.  The movie, like most Hitchcock films, seemed quite good.",1425945600,,226,4.113636363636363

Anything has to be better than that. For anyone who adored the book, the movie is a huge disapointment. It was nothing like the book! The book was chilling and suspenseful, with an ending that leaves you wanting more. The movie was completely different. There were no chills, no thrills, and just went on and on. And with a happy ending! What's the fun in that? A thriller shouldn't have such a happy ending. Shame on you, Hitch! Anyone who's thinking of buying this one, I recommend reading the book.

While the whole capital speculates in contagious fear, a new lodger turned up at a peaceful boarding house... He wears a black cloak and carries a black bag...

There are other details which make us mistrust the mysterious tenant without, obviously, conclusive proof... So is he or isn't he the serial killer?

7912961,3,B00000JNVC,"Hitchcock's Sabotage is an important film for our times as well as the late 1930's in which it premiered. A group of Nazi terrorists are working within England in the days immediately preceeding WWII. One of these is the small cinema owner Verloc whose involvement at the beginning of the film is limited to the nonviolent shutdown of a power station. Later he is tasked with delivering a bomb to Picadilly Circus. This plot goes terribly wrong and a family member is killed.

The disc I viewed is by Laserlight and was not terribly good. The image and sound quality were poor but this was to be expected from such a low priced offering. The upside is that one gets to view an  early film by Hitchcock that is not well known and generally available. It would be great if a better transfer were made available for some of these earlier works but this one is well worth checking out.",1142380800,,881,4.5
7912962,4,B00000JNVC,"""Sabotage"" is one of Hitchcock's early British efforts and thus it has the cinematic sensibility that he retained at that time in most of his British films, which is an experimental, adventurous approach that resulted in numerous, visually innovative films. The film is suspensful, typically ahead of its time and visually stylish, but suffers from the tonal inconsistencies that plagued Hitchcock's films at that time (priror to him finding his true narrative style in the 40's), but still has many ingenious visual moments and suspense sequences. ""The Lodger"" which Hitchcock considered to be his first film (although it wasn't) due to it being the first film that really showed his style and individuality, is nothing less than a silent masterpiece of suspense cinema, featuring exquisite expressionistic compositions and several plot and visual motifs that would later become the key ingredients of Hitchcock's unparalleled style and brand of cinema. The Laserlight dvd is a very recommended buy as it features a good print of ""Sabotage"", with nice contrast and acceptable sound, while it also features a watchable print of ""The Lodger"" (considering the film's age) as an extra as well as the trailer for ""Foreign correspondent"". All this makes this dvd an almost unmissable, value package for fans of classic cinema and of course for fans of one of cinema's most important innovators.",1113091200,,1389,5.261261261261262
