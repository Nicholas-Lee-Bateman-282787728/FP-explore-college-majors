I learnt a lot from this DVD about choosing your colour palette, lighting a scene and atmospheric perspective. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone starting off in matte painting...I've already purchased Dylan's next one.",1266105600,,404,4.869565217391305

The tutorials are sped up so they go quite fast but its very easy to understand and stop and replay over and over, you defiantly get the idea.  His photoshop techniques are simple and the more you watch it the more you understand, the example plates are beautiful and great to play around with.

Im looking forward to getting the rest of his DVDs!",1207440000,3,395,4.458333333333333

It all seems so effortless for him, the way he lays the strokes on the screen, but of course for others who don't draw for their dayjob, the spontaneity turns to frustration when they try to create the same masterpieces. Nonetheless, it's still a treat to watch Dylan work, and he's been a great inspiration for me.",1206403200,3,417,4.5
