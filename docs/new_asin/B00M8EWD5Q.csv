6564600,4,B00M8EWD5Q,"Anyone interested in the new Indian motorcycles will want to own this disc, if for nothing else the images of original bikes.
The archival film footage alone is worth the price. I could watch hours of the black and white celluloid with all of the grain, pops and flashes.
The bikes and owners are interesting to see and listen to; these gentlemen have been around the park a few times on their machines.
I'll revisit this CD from time to time then pass it along to other enthusiast.",1425513600,2,482,4.488636363636363

6564606,5,B00M8EWD5Q,"This is an incredible documentary with inteviews with many of the great people who were involved with Indian during it's Golden Age. Many who are no longer with us. Thank you for making and sharing this incredible film for future generations to see, and learn from. And for re-releasing it on DVD. Now I can finally get rid of my VCR!
I have watched it a dozen times and I still love it.
If you have an interest in Indian motorcycles, and you haven't seen it, you don't know what your missing!
An amazing piece of American Motorcycle History.",1408060800,11,542,4.484848484848484

6564608,5,B00M8EWD5Q,Great Video on the history of Indian Motorcycle.,1484092800,,48,5.125
6564609,1,B00M8EWD5Q,"Not bad if this is a home video production. The video quality is a 0 not sure if the camera was always out of focus or watching something that was recorded in the 1980's. Back of the DVD case shows 2013 so I was expecting better quality video. The aspect ratio is off, and video suffers from interlacing at time. Sound levels jump and the audio/video does not flow. This looks like a high school student did the filming and editing.

The only redeeming part of this film it the stories told by the old timers.",1482019200,2,509,4.302083333333333

6564612,1,B00M8EWD5Q,"I love indian motorcycle and looked forward to watching this documentary.  I know it was made over twenty years ago but its poor quality for then.  The stories from the older guys were good, but the bad interview skills of the filmmaker made it not flow.  And don't get me started on the background music....jezzzz!",1472947200,3,315,4.6909090909090905
6564613,4,B00M8EWD5Q,Cool story but poor quality. Seems like an 1980s Vhs copy,1471219200,,57,4.2727272727272725

6564616,1,B00M8EWD5Q,Disliked the show. It was an amature production and for people who know about Indian motorcycles the indian summer refers to the totally victorious 1911 Isle of Mann TT. This dvd has nothing to do with this event which left me totally disappointed.,1467590400,,248,4.790697674418604

6564619,5,B00M8EWD5Q,Great summary of Indian Motorcycle from owners perspective.  Done like a film majors project instead of a historical piece,1461024000,,122,5.421052631578948

6564622,2,B00M8EWD5Q,"Despite fast and prompt delivery, the film is way over priced. It was done in 1994 with very bad audio and even corney and inappropriate music that doesn't fit the ""vintage"" scenes. It was good to see the old bikes but the video as is should sell for no more that $5.99 in my opinion.",1459382400,2,284,4.181818181818182
6564623,4,B00M8EWD5Q,Was not as good as expected!!!,1457049600,,30,4.166666666666667
6564624,3,B00M8EWD5Q,"Kind of a hodge podge of facts, old pictures and film with some actual peoples stories.  Kind of a low cost production from maybe the early 70's.

Worth watching on a rainy day and appreciate those who are passionate about motorcycles, especially Indians.",1455753600,2,255,4.906976744186046

6564629,2,B00M8EWD5Q,"Poorly scripted, disjointed somewhat hard to follow collection of interviews with rather  poor photography. Not owning an Indian, I wondered why I bothered. Don't know if I finished it. Boring!",1439251200,,193,5.433333333333334

6564632,5,B00M8EWD5Q,"this is not a high dollar production film.  It is clearly a work of passion and provides some insight into Indian's history that I had not heard before.  If you are into motorcycles, this is worth the price.",1429401600,,207,4.421052631578948

6564636,1,B00M8EWD5Q,"I beg to differ with the other review--which I read in advance of the purchase.
This attempt at a ""movie""--which is really shot like some rinky-dink home video project is amazing in its horrible production quality.  There MAY be some interesting bits of information here, but after 20 minutes, I couldn't take it any more.

I threw it away-I'd hate to give it to someone else for them to dislike as well.

Really a waste of money.  Consider yourself warned.",1426809600,4,457,4.675

8670727,5,B00M8EWD5Q,"Sure, if you can get past the home video style, you're in for a treat of a colorful cast of old timers (Doc, Brownie, Whitey, Butch...)  who talk  about and display their vintage Indians, while wonderful background of music by a group called Needles plays in the background. So good was the music, that I looked for the songs on iTunes, but sadly, they're not there.  This movie covers the history of the Indian motorcycle, and is explained lovingly by guys who as old as 89 years old who are owners and fans of Indian.  The filmmaker traveled all over the U.S. interviewing Indian experts and aficionados, and covered speed racing, dirt bike racing, and of course, includes the bike's mechanics.  By the end, I felt like family.",1524182400,,729,4.6640625
8670728,5,B00M8EWD5Q,Keep in mind as you view this video it is a true time capsule. Never to be meant as an Oscar winning film..what these two people did back in the 90s (more than likely unknowingly) was to record the last remaining history of the Indian legacy. ..if you love indian 1901-1953 this is a must have part of your library. ...,1518739200,,319,4.245901639344262
8670729,2,B00M8EWD5Q,"The production talked to some very important people in Indian's history, but don't expect it to be a great view.",1511481600,,112,4.65
8670730,5,B00M8EWD5Q,"I was somewhat apprehensive about this purchase, having read a few negative reviews on line regarding production quality, but I was pleasantly surprised. Much of this DVD is comprised of archive footage and early 1990's documentary-style film-making, so don't expect HD  and Widescreen. You can, however, expect a beautifully nostalgic look back at the early days of Indian Motorcycle Company and its various luminaries. I'm a Harley guy, but I've always been intrigued by Indian. Timothy Cataldo, primarily through interviews with colorful old characters, captures the magic that drew so many to ride these fascinating machines.",1491609600,3,629,5.552083333333333
