8245008,4,B0012BW4XC,To be quite honest the production quality of this video leaves something to be desired but it does feature some beautiful cars.  As I am a lover of all things Mercedes I am happy to have it.,1446422400,,190,4.135135135135135
8245009,3,B0012BW4XC,"The History of Mercedes-Benz begins with the founders, Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler (with his partner Wilhelm Maybach), who were the first to produce early automobiles. The DVD does a good job of showing the founding of both car companies (originally Daimler and Benz were separate firms) as well as the early cars and the economic situation that led to the merger.

The DVD does a very good job of showing the viewer the rare, the beautiful and the fast cars as the M-B car evolved over time from the early days of the auto to about the 1960's. The viewer gets to see rare, Concours d'Elegance condition autos from every angle possible. The narrator gives you the technical specs for motor development. The video doesn't do as good a job of showing the viewer the more pedestrian cars that made the company profitable so the rare luxury cars could be produced.

The production itself is a little amateurish. Although the camera work is excellent and gives you an excellent view of interiors, motors and body lines, the narrator is obviously reading from a teleprompter to the left of the camera. Yes, it's that obvious. The viewer will soon tire of the 1920's jazz soundtrack - unless that's your favorite music. The audio and video are not synchronized so it looks like a foreign film that's been dubbed in English!

Although the cinematography is quite good and the viewer will get to see some very rare and wonderful works of automotive art, the production itself leaves something to be desired. It's just okay and gets three stars.",1389484800,,1538,4.752808988764045
