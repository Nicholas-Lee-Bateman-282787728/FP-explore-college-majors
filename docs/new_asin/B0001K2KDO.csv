8360493,1,B0001K2KDO,I would have given it zero stars had it been an option.  It appears to be a bootleg copy or something and it does not work in my play station or DVD player.  I requested a refund about a week ago and it doesn't look like they will be getting back to me.  I'm honestly surprised my bank account wasn't cleaned out because it seems as though this was a scam.,1493251200,,356,3.9859154929577465
