7958819,3,B0000636JZ,"Poor production and sound quality. Song selection and show OK but this show from almost a decade or more ago now, was either not intended to be a live show DVD recording (and Dale Watson sort of mentions it during the set so apparently it was) or it was a last moment decision to do so because the sound, camera and overall production value is petty weak.

If you're a true country fan and want the dee jay ""Please play a REAL country song' then DVD is OK. But be forewarned about the poor production quality.",1405123200,,509,4.302083333333333

7958821,5,B0000636JZ,Just a Damn Good Show! This live concert by Dale Watson is a must have for Country Music lovers! Great Country Music!!,1368230400,,118,4.409090909090909
7958822,5,B0000636JZ,"If you like traditional honky tonk music and Texas swing, this video is for you!!  And if you don't know anything about this kind of music or Dale Watson, this video is for you!  There's no way you cannot absolutely love it!!  If all were fair in this world, Dale would be getting inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.  That's how good he is!!  Try to see him live, but if you can't (or in between shows), this DVD will make you very happy.  Yes, real country music is still alive and thriving and coursing through Dale's veins.  When is Nashville going to wake up?!!!",1210636800,4,576,4.327102803738318
7958823,5,B0000636JZ,"Dale Watson is country--first time I saw him play he was Merle Haggard-but in these days of rock-country Pat Green crap, the road forward has been a struggle. But he is out there now playing great pure country music to loyal Texas and European fans-this performance was recorded in Europe--why can we not do this in Texas??
The Amazon product description gives the details of this great DVD,the sound is perfect,performance is great. Simple heartfelt songs, with great steel guitar(thank you Ricky Davis),bass and drums. When you are out driving the highways of Texas late at night,listen to Dale and the band,even better go see him play, or just sit at home and watch this DVD,its Texas country music at its finest-and it doesn't get any better than that.",1193875200,6,756,4.868217054263566
