Although Amira has an incredible physique, she doesn't threaten us at all. She always makes a point of telling us to enjoy and be happy when we dance. We love her accent, and how comfortable she is with her femininity -- something the rest of us are all striving to accomplish in ourselves. While we collectively own just about all of her DVDs and VHSs, we truly enjoy this one's slow pace and careful attention to putting together a ""veil-focused"" choreography.

Our only criticisms are first, that it cannot be played on the laptop computer that we use at the dance studio (because of the format,) and second, that there's some floorwork involved that is not only ill-advised for those of us with questionable knees and backs, but also the hip undulations have been compared by one of our group to a ""baited fish on a hook."" Perhaps it's menopause that makes us view it that way instead of something sexy and enticing. In any case, it does not lessen the enjoyment of learning how to properly drape and tuck a veil, untuck, and work with it in a confined space, (like in a crowded dance studio.)

Amira has plenty of heart-thumping DVDs for twenty-somethings questing buns of steel. This DVD would not be for them. For you older survivors battling the bulges, this is down-through-the-ages feminine fun. Welcome to World of Bellydance!",1147737600,13,1485,4.912350597609562

 H O R R I B L E !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have 2 other Amira Mor DVDs and can attest to them being absolutely awful as well. (thankfully they were a gift from somebody, so I didn't waste my own money on them)
This woman CAN NOT DANCE TO SAVE HER LIFE ! Her rhythm is awful, the way she dances is more like a stripper, not the art form that bellydance really should be.
Amazon carries some wonderful videos put out by Natural Journeys, such as the Veena & Neena videos, and the Rania videos. Buy those instead, you'll be glad you did. Don't waste your money on Amira Mor garbage.",1069977600,9,672,4.25
7992075,1,B00009NRXK,"Amira Mor is a horrible belly dancer. Being an Arabic woman this is a disgrace to see. Save your money and buy a real belly dancing video that features a dancer that actually has rhythm, timing, feeling and technical understanding. She dances in a very tasteless way with no understanding for this art. She is very contrived, wear costumes like a stripper, not an authentic belly dancer! She is one unattractive dancer too!
Awful!",1066348800,6,430,4.824324324324325
