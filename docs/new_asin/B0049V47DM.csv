8591304,4,B0049V47DM,"The President Franklin Pierce Homestead built in 1804 by the rags-to-riches Revolutionary War veteran, Benjamin Pierce, is indeed a lovely museum house open to the public from late May through Columbus Day.
Included is interesting footage of the small New Hampshire towns of Hillsborough, Francestown & Hancock; places the highway bound traveler won't see.
Most scenic are Hillsborough's stone arch bridges (held together w/o mortar), rushing streams and autumn foliage lined dirt lanes, giving one a real feel for the time & place in which the 14th President spent the first 30 years of his life.

The DVD does show the Homestead throughout the seasons, which is a big plus.
There are also glimpses into the attic & cellar, areas off limits for the general public.

Would have liked to have seen a round table discussion of Pierce's administration, but the information offered is adequate & not sugar coated.
This was also the President's home for the 1st 30 years of his life & that is what the focus is upon here.
This Georgian Federal style house, though briefly & sparingly shot for the C-Span Presidential series, is a hidden gem & not before filmed in it's entirety.

The young film maker interned with Ken Burns' Florentine Productions and the influence shows in the best light",1290988800,,1285,4.939814814814815
