5335611,5,B009H3LNSE,"If  you  got  the  Reunion  Dvd  from  last  year.  This  Dvd  is most of all that--But it has  more to it.
Part of another show--w/Kevin  Godley  coming on Stage--first time in  30 plus years??/something
like that.  Plus--during one of the shows--I didn't know that  Graham  Gouldman--wrote  songs  for
the  Hollies/Yardbirds--etc.  Which  they play  during  one of the shows.  So  if your  a fan,  This
is worth picking up--since  there aren't  many  10cc  dvd's out there.  Plus one of the  bonus  features
with now the late  Storm  Thorgerhson--talks  about  the band and  the album  covers he did for them.
So  if your a fan, and  since there isn't  a lot of  footage out there of the band.  This is worth  picking  up.
Next for me--is  the  10cc  box set--""Tenology""--which  has a  dvd  with it as well.",1368921600,8,809,4.592592592592593
5335612,5,B009H3LNSE,They are very good group even on their younger days. It's a DVD worth buying. I just hope they will come with a Blu-ray.,1366761600,,120,4.041666666666667
5335613,4,B009H3LNSE,"As good as the concert was (and it was great), the interview with Graham Gouldman was worth watching in itself.  His writing for The Hollies, Yardbirds, Herman's Hermits produced many memorable songs, the influences showing up in 10cc.  The band was in great form - the song ""Ready To Go Home"" was stunning.  Granted, 10cc are best known for their top hits, but this concert video shows their range of genres.  Very entertaining and fun to watch!",1362960000,2,446,4.753246753246753
5335614,5,B009H3LNSE,"10cc has been around a while and they have a lot of really great material. The audio and video quality of this release is very very good. I only wish it had been released as a Blu-Ray. It certainly deserves that treatment. Still, the DVD's quality is as good as that format gets.

The guys perform most of their best material and they don't show their age. The quality of their musicianmanship and singing is all top notch!

If this is released on Blu-Ray, I'll buy it again. You should too!",1361577600,3,491,4.384615384615385

8541577,2,B009H3LNSE,not very good - sound quality and filming very poor.  not impressed at all.,1447027200,,75,4.357142857142857
8541578,4,B009H3LNSE,Wasn't sure what I was getting but this easily makes the top 15 in a collection of 300 concert dvd's.,1426032000,,101,4.1
8541579,5,B009H3LNSE,One of the best DVD's I purchased for a while.,1419120000,,46,3.7
8541580,5,B009H3LNSE,exactly what I expected.,1418860800,,24,5.25
8541581,2,B009H3LNSE,Eric Stewart was not with the band.  This was an enormous disappointment.  Once again if Amazon would provide more information about it's CD's and DVD's this sort of thing could be avoided.,1403827200,4,189,4.875
8541582,4,B009H3LNSE,"I saw them in concert in Queenstown NZ earlier this year and they certainly had lots of stage presence. Maybe it was the vineyard in amongst the mountains setting, but it was hard to beat. The video is good but not quite the same. Well worth getting mind you and if they had a 4.5 star rating it would get it.",1402790400,,309,4.081967213114754
8541583,5,B009H3LNSE,"With the exception of Godley's terribly long ""ballad"", it's a great show and a must see for all 10cc fans.",1400457600,,106,4.35
8541584,4,B009H3LNSE,"Great Concert!
Best that I expected
Good performances, A wonderfull surprise that they a lot of songs for groups as The Hollies...  Great valu DVD",1378684800,,146,4.84
8541585,5,B009H3LNSE,"10cc has been around since 1972 in one form or another and they never disappoint. Graham Gouldman has been the one constant along with long time cronies Rick Fenn And Paul Burgess and on stage for the first time in 30 years, Kevin Godley. The band smokes and the harmonizes are amazing. Great song list with some stuff written for old '60's bands like The Hollies and The Yardbirds.  This could have been a 2 disc set and it still wouldn't be enough...the body of work is that deep.  Have watched everyday since I got it.",1378080000,3,521,4.416666666666667
