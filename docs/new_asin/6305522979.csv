1058753,5,6305522979,Wonderful movie with wonderful effects. Very scary. A must see.  More horror movies like this one should be released these days.,1013472000,,128,5.095238095238095
1058754,5,6305522979,"I bought this movie because I remembered seeing it 22 years ago when I was in junior high school...(Wait..it's been 22 years already??? Yikes!)....My friend and I rented this movie over and over and had it totally memorized.  It scared us half to death.  I could not believe I found it again, so I bought it.  I admit that it was not as scary as it used to seem when I was younger, but keeping in mind that the movie is really old, I still have to say that it's impressive.  The acting isn't the best in the world, but the plot is weird, and the music is creepy!  What I noticed after seeing it again after 22 years is that a lot of scary movies that later made it BIG (such as Friday the 13th and Amityville Horror) seemed to ""copy"" techniques from this movie.  I wonder if some of the same people were involved in making the movies.  The movie isn't TOO gory to show to older children, except for two parts.  One part shows a little too much skin (briefly) and a couple of other parts are fairly suggestive.  A couple of ways that the people get killed are pretty funny.  I feel kind of bad to bust out laughing when somebody gets killed in a movie, but it's only a movie.  I gave this movie 5 stars because I think it was good for its time.  If you like creepy old movies, you'll probably like this.",1006560000,5,1302,4.164
1058755,4,6305522979,"Within the first 15 minutes of the film, the only thing that came to my mind was: HALLOWEEN. At first I thought this was kind of a parody...but  then it began to develop, and turned into a really great movie. At some  scenes, I get reminded of movies like AMITYVILLE & The EXORCIST.  Anyway, here's the story: A kid kill his mother's lover, a few years later  they get haunted. But by who? Is the lover still alive, or does the kid  countinue to kill? Who knows. I recommend you find out. It's defently worth  it.",966556800,4,513,4.291666666666667
1058756,3,6305522979,"I found THE BOOGEYMAN a lot scarier when I was younger, but it still holds a good amount of chills and atmosphere 20 years later. It combines THE EXORCIST with HALLOWEEN as a young woman, whose younger brother murdered  their mother's lover, is possessed by the dead man and seeks revenge.  It  makes great use of dark corners and turns ordinary household items like  scissors and mirrors into suspenseful instruments of death.  Skip its two  rip-off sequels, BOOGEYMAN 2 & RETURN OF THE BOOGEYMAN, but definitely  take a look at this moody fright film.",964310400,2,553,4.819148936170213
1058855,1,6305522979,"Some people might call this a classic film, but I found nothing special about it at all.

Slow moving and stretches of boredom. I skipped ahead a few times. I'm really glad it was
free on Prime or I'd consider it a waste of money",1456272000,,229,4.088888888888889
1058856,4,6305522979,"Great movie, but it does take a long time for the story to develope.  And when the violence does happen, it's pretty gory.  This review is from my 12 year old son.",1448236800,,163,4.0625
1058857,1,6305522979,Slow moving .  Glad it was free!  Only watched about 20 minutes and turned on a different movie.,1447113600,,96,4.277777777777778
1058858,1,6305522979,I am sorry but the original picture that showed up on my search was not this particular movie.  The correct movie is not even in your library.,1446076800,,142,4.2592592592592595
1058859,5,6305522979,"Possibly THE best horror movie ever made? Yes, I think so.",1445817600,,58,4.363636363636363
1058860,1,6305522979,Horrible even for the 80's !,1445644800,,28,3.8333333333333335
1058861,3,6305522979,"It was a pretty good movie. Nothing great, but pretty good.",1445472000,,59,4.454545454545454
1058862,2,6305522979,"This movie TERRIFIED me as a 9 year old child, but hasn't aged well. I couldn't make it through 20 minutes but not because of the slow pacing The picture is dark and blurry.  I think the original VHS i watched had a better picture.  I gave an extra star for the awesome synthesizer score.",1439424000,,288,4.218181818181818
1058863,5,6305522979,"Interesting, suspenseful , supernatural, ghosts",1434499200,,47,8.6
1058864,1,6305522979,"I really shouldn't review this movie. I couldn't get thru the first 15 minutes. The thing is, I LIKE bad movies, but this movie is so far beyond, or rather beneath, ""bad"" that I feel obligated to warn others away. Abandon hope all ye who abandon here!",1412640000,,251,4.361702127659575
1058895,1,6305522979,"This stupid movie came up as an option when I typed in 'Children's Halloween Movies' on Prime.  The first three minutes show that it is not a child safe movie.  I'm sure the stupid cheap FX are fine for adults.  But not child safe.  Thankfully I sat down with my little one to watch it.  The first few minutes show a dumb drunk and a woman throwing her stockings over a drunk man, child bondage and kids armed with knives.  This is followed by cheesy clothed sex scenes.  At that point (thankfully) I shut the movie off and complained to Amazon that this came up as a family safe option.  For adults, not my issue.  For any parent that sees this crappy movie show up in their Halloween options for their kids, pick another movie.  I've complained and requested it be removed from the children's category.  My review is here to warn parents only, as I have not watched more than three minutes worth of this crap.  I do love cheesy B movies, but not when they show up as an option in children's movies.",1412467200,2,1000,4.345945945945946
1058896,3,6305522979,"Entertaining B movie. Not scary, but pure fun. Good cast. Campy. Predictable, but enjoyable. A must see for those who like B movies.",1411430400,,132,4.782608695652174
1058897,1,6305522979,"Very low budget and dumb plot, yet I keep watching it simply BECAUSE it is so awful. It is laughably ridiculous. I cheered when the annoying little brother screams ""Boogey Man"" and is crushed to death in the window sill.",1410480000,,220,4.525
1058898,2,6305522979,It's okay.,1409443200,,10,4.5
1058899,3,6305522979,Not a great movie but would be a good once a year movie for Halloween.,1408320000,,70,3.7333333333333334
1058900,1,6305522979,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am truly flabbergasted by all the good reviews...reading through the five star ones I think many are the same person.  This movie has blood as thick as honey barely oozing from a cut to the jugular and that's good effects?  The husband supposedly pieced back together a completely shattered mirror in a matter of hours?  The last piece of mirror stays stuck on the bottom of a child's shoe for days?  A girl doesn't report an attempted murder? What about the mother?  What was Willie's punishment in the beginning?  How was she just 23 but married to a much older guy and with a six or seven year old and why were they still living with the aunt?  I'm sorry, but I love a good B horror flick as much as anyone but this one was horrible.  And why was John Carradine given top biling when he was in the movie all of five minutes?  And Amazon...why do you have this listed as  being a 2013 movie?",1406851200,,948,4.216666666666667
1058901,2,6305522979,"I suspect all the stellar reviews for this movie are based on nostalgia. As a first time watcher who
love, Love, LOVES old horror movies I was personally not impressed. Maybe I am just spoiled by the classics, but the film quality despite being remastered was not pleasant to watch or listen to. The acting varies from pretty decent to downright terrible, the decent actors were killed off early so you have to put up with the rest. The pacing was alright, but the plot was really very boring and even for the early 80's the idea of a possessed mirror was already cliche, then they piled on top of it with every other trope such as possession, and gratuitous death.

If you are really into slashers I guess this is worth a watch, but only to say you did. Don't expect to be frightened, or even startled by a jump scare. I can see how if you watched this as a person in the 80's or as a little kid you might like this movie, but honestly just skip it and watch Exorcist again.",1404172800,5,975,4.27027027027027
1058902,5,6305522979,This movie will give you nightmares! It is awesome! Usually I would say watch it alone in the dark BUT DO NOT WATCH IT ALONE! This movie is pretty hard to find these days too and sort of pricey. It needs to be re-released on DVD.,1117152000,2,229,4.0
1058903,3,6305522979,"Sigmund Freud could have written the script, had not the religious people in this film been described as pretty normal. Or at least, their religion is not their problem. But still, killing your mother's lover and then trying to live on sounds like something that would have come straight out of Freud's own dark subconscious.

Synthersizer music, women with straight long hair and the colours (among other things) give an early eighties feeling, which of course always is a good thing. The story is not very original, but not uncreative either. A broken mirror and a man who has been dead for 20 years make people bleed, scared or dead. If Michael Myers wears a Halloween mask, Jason a hockey mask, this guy wears a stocking over his head. That's original, but not independent.

The film is never scary, but neither uninteresting; actually it's rather fascinating and entertaining.",1116806400,,881,4.945945945945946
1058904,5,6305522979,"I thought this film was very scary, and I like other viewers feel that it isn't getting the attention it deserves. It's not ""just another slasher"" it is one of a kind. It's kindof a mix between The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, and Halloween. Why it has been neglected so much, beats me. I enjoyed it. Some acting is a little cheesy, but you can get through it. I recommend watching this alone in the dark. Have fun. Get scared.",1038787200,3,431,4.4
7892856,4,6305522979,"After a flashback opening from 20 years earlier, complete w/ child abuse and a brutal murder (in blatant HALLOWEEN style), THE BOOGEY MAN shifts ahead to the current day (1980). Brother and sister, Willy (Nicholas Love) and Lacey (Suzanna Love) are adults now. Willy, aside from not being able to speak, seems fairly normal, while Lacey appears perfectly fine. They live an idyllic life on their aunt and uncle's farm (in the twin of the AMITYVILLE HORROR house), having left their hideous ordeal behind them. Unfortunately, Lacey has been suffering from terrible nightmares, causing her husband to get her to face her past, in order to get over it. So, he takes Lacey back to her childhood home, the scene of the original crime. This isn't... wise. A supernatural event takes place, involving an old mirror, making matters far worse than before! Unwilling to accept defeat, Lacey's husband decides to re-double his efforts. This proves to be... catastrophic! The creep-factor skyrockets, as a great eeevil has been unleashed, causing death and destruction! Then, a priest is called in, and the paranormal $#!t hits the fan! Made almost entirely from grade A cheeeze-corn, THE BOOGEY MAN is still quite enjoyable. This, in spite of its sub-par acting, ditz-y dialogue, and a lumbering plot, w/ several scenes causing more laughs than chills. THE BOOGEY MAN makes up for its silliness and cheeeze, by boasting an original idea w/ a macabre atmosphere. Co-stars John Carradine, in what amounts to an extended cameo, as Dr. Whats-his-name. Worth a watch or three...",1500336000,,1562,5.081712062256809
7892857,5,6305522979,"Super eerie, original, unique, and cool. This movie is like magic to me. I don't get the other reviews; I guess some people just don't ""get it."" If you're a big fan of the original Phantasm, I think there's a good possibility you might be of the disposition such that you could really appreciate this movie as well. There is definitely nothing formulaic or cheesy in the typical sense about this movie; it is extremely atmospheric and as stated earlier, eerie; it is not like any other movie, of its time or since.",1483920000,,514,4.537634408602151
7892858,1,6305522979,Pretty boring...didn't finish watching it!,1477094400,,42,7.6
7892859,2,6305522979,"Since I like John Carradine I was hoping this movie was like Spider Baby was with Lon Chaney Jr., dumb, but a really great cult movie. Nope. Just dumb and gets dumber the longer you watch it. No cult status here. Just for John Carradine fans.",1476662400,,242,4.282608695652174
7892860,3,6305522979,First of all the description says this movie was made in 2011.  This is the 1980 version.  Emily Deschanel is not in it.  Suzanne Love is.  But other than that I liked it for a while.  The beginning music sounded VERY similar to the Halloween movie theme and the white house even resembled Michael Meyers.  But the more I watched the dumber it got.  But it is better than the movies they make nowadays so I gave it 3 stars.,1475107200,,423,4.2125
7892861,1,6305522979,"Wow, not very good.  Probably not even very good for it's original time period of 1980s.",1468281600,,88,4.5
7892862,4,6305522979,This one gets mixed reviews depending on who you ask- me? I think it is a fun old horror movie and is worth the watch. If you like late 70's and 80's horror I think you will be amused.,1465516800,,184,3.7435897435897436
7892863,4,6305522979,Boogey Man!! Fun little cheesy 80s flick..But still gotta love the cooky atmosphere and story..Plus the soundtrack is very good..Great for a rainy day or night at home..Pop some popcorn and watch out for the Boogey Man!!,1461110400,,220,4.972972972972973
