8388953,5,B0035G08TY,"A must see program about the ground and air attacks of the Allied forces against the Germans in World War II. Spectacular war-time footage! Nice opening speech given by then President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Narration by actual soldiers and civilians alike was remarkable! I love what one French soldier had to say about his rapid march to Paris to take back the city from German occupation. He said the orders came through to go and take Paris, saying, ""We marched 250 kilometers in one day. I think I'll tell it to all my grandchildren, and bore them with it until I die"". One French woman said when the French came that summer to re-capture the city from the Germans, ""We realized how unhappy we were for four years, and now how happy we were to be alive that August"".

The ground force battles and footage were remarkable! You must see them to realize how much it took to win the war against Germany.

The air battle scenes are equally superb! Germany was physically destroyed by air bombing raids before its army was even destroyed. Tactical use of air power was used to drop 500 tons of bombs on Germany in one battle. Long-range fighter planes went into action to protect the Allied bomber planes. The P-51 planes were put into action in 1943 to escort the bomber plane missions. The P-51 could fly at top-speed, 440 miles per hour and had 50 caliber machine guns onboard. In 1945 Germany's tank production factory was completely destroyed, and its ability to produce tanks or parts for tanks never recovered from the Allied bombing.

Wonderfully produced program with archival footage throughout. You'll really love the simple narration of people who actually fought and lived through this horrible period in our history. You won't forget this program - it stays with you, and so do the people like the French soldier who is going to bore his grandchildren to death with his wartime stories until he dies......",1378944000,,1917,4.7507507507507505
