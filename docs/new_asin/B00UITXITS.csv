8706985,3,B00UITXITS,"I never fail to be surprised at how few reviewers discuss the quality of the transfers to DVD, particularly with vintage material like this 2 disc set from SYNERGY. I was badly bitten by ALPHA Video and their 3 volumes of ""Sheena"" which, in my opinion, were unwatchable, but as someone who enjoys vintage TV shows, and never having seen Irish McCalla I was determined to try again. I have to report that while these transfers are better than Alpha, they really aren't very good. Poor muffled sound, and hazy bleached picture, make it a bit of a struggle to watch. In fairness to Synergy I somehow doubt there is better source material, and I should stress the episodes are watchable, but only just, and perhaps only if you are an Irish fan. The price is good. Ironically the feature film ""SAVAGE GIRL"" is much better quality if a little ragged, but it is a 1932 film. Recomended with extreme caution. 4.3 ratio. No subtitles. (P.S. The episodes? Well I have only managed 3, and they are a bit juvenile, but in the right mood...Fun, and Ms. McCalla does look fantastic.)",1489536000,2,1069,4.602094240837697
8706986,4,B00UITXITS,The movie had a lot of quirky character to it which was interesting.,1475625600,,68,4.3076923076923075
8706987,5,B00UITXITS,"Lot of fun.  The Sheena stuff was why I bought it,  but the feature film is a gem",1455580800,,81,3.4444444444444446
8706988,5,B00UITXITS,"Very nice set, although these are all available several places and this is not the complete set of Sheena nor is it the First 16 episodes. These are scattered shows but still great. There was a total of 26 episodes and this seems to be all the ones most people have.",1436227200,,266,4.235294117647059
8706989,4,B00UITXITS,"Movie was good. Lots of old time fun, Sorry I can't give it five stars, but the disc advertises the Sheena part of the set as a serial. This is not a cliff hanger serial in the traditional manner. It is nothing more than a 15 episode tv show in which there is no connecting story line. The episodes are are fun and enjoyable.",1433980800,,325,4.09375
