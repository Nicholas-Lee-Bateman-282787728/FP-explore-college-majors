4993069,1,B006JIL0AG,I wish I could say more -- but this is a terrible movie. Saw 2 positive reviews and watched (part of) it based off of that. Wish I would have listened to the 3rd reviewer. Just not funny. Stupid.,1327795200,3,195,4.0256410256410255
4993070,2,B006JIL0AG,"I rented this movie based solely on the RAVE reviews the other two reviewers gave.  Seriously, they must be related to someone in the movie because it is not ""all that"".  This is an average movie that uses bathroom humor to call it a comedy.  I think bathroom humor is tacky, thus I did not like the movie.  Let me explain.  Early in the movie Zeta-Jones goes on a date at the urging of her best friend.  This guy stops on the streets of New York and uses a port a potty.  While in there, doing his thing, he holds a conversation with her grunting and straining the whole time.  After he comes out he starts touching her all over.  Now we all know there is no where to wash your hands in there so this is pretty gross.  She is a clean a phob anyway, putting hand sanitizer on the kids all the time so the fact that she lets this guy put his fingers in her mouth is ridiculous.  Shortly after that you get to see a squirrel nailed to a poster board and cut open with all the insides placed on the board and labeled.  This is a school project and absolutely gross.  One of the kids pukes ever ten minutes which you also get to see. During one scene the ""nanny"", Zeta-Jones' love interest, leaves her a voice mail that says the kid ""pooped a 14 incher, I measured.""  Seriously!  There is far too much cussing for a movie that involves kids.  There is also a love scene in the living room on the couch.....knowing the children are in their rooms.  Naturally the kid wakes up and asks questions.  It is supposed to be about an average new divorcee but its totally unrealistic.  Zeta-Jones is gorgeous throughout the entire movie and she can have good chemistry with anyone so the relationship works but I have trouble picturing him doing anything but acting second fiddle to Nicholas Cage.  If Amazon puts this on a 99 cent sale....try it, you might like it but don't wast 3.99 and an evening watching this dribble.",1327795200,9,1910,4.326760563380281
4993071,5,B006JIL0AG,"I found ""The Rebound"" a straightforward and enjoyable 'Adult' Romantic Comedy, written and directed by Bart Freundlich, and not your usual tired fare.  After all, this one stars Catherine Zeta-Jones (Sandy) and Justin Bartha (Aram) as the two leads.  You really can't go wrong with these two presenting a younger man and an older woman theme.  Sandy's two children, Sadie (Kelly Gould) and Frank (Andrew Cherry) are just adorable and precocious as ever.  The R rating is for the themes explored, sexual innuendo, and for some bawdy language, making this a romance, with generous slices of comedy for adults.

This story basically starts with a forty-year-old, married Sandy, on her laptop looking through video clips of her beautiful children for her son's Birthday Party.  As she's perusing through the happy scenes, she spies in the background her husband being unfaithful.  Thankfully, as this is a comedy, his behavior does not get explored in detail.  We quickly focus on Sandy and the children moving into an apartment in New York City above a coffee shop.  This is where the very amiable Aram works and they all first meet.

The children quickly take notice of him and immediately like him.  Shortly after meeting Aram, he offers his babysitting services to free up Sandy for her now necessary job hunt.  Sandy gains work for a major sports network as she's an avid sports fan and educated in this area. Her boss, Laura Reilly is strongly acted by Lynn Whitfield who becomes a definite role model for Sandy.  The 'babysitter', whom the children adore and so does Sandy, is permanently employed as the kid's ""manny"".  The two find a comfortable friendship with each other by this time and Sandy is getting more stable and happy with her life after the incident with her now ex-husband.

Aram has a degree in Sociology, although is content working in the coffee shop as he has been hit hard emotionally by a relationship also.  He married a French woman who used him cruelly.  He lives with his parents, the Finkelstein's (Art Garfunkel acts the part of the father in a uniquely comedic role).  Aram possesses a generous, warm and thoughtful nature that one couldn't help but love.  One of Sandy's friends begins urging, even hounding her to go on a blind date with a Chiropractor, Trevor (John Schneider), while Sandy really doesn't want any part of it.  She finally relents and leaves the kids with Aram to go out with him.  As far as blind dates go, this one takes the cake as Trevor is a complete fool and Sandy's responses to him are quite funny.  When she returns to the apartment after the date from hell, Aram is there for her afterward. You could definitely say she is happy about that...

As usual with this type of movie, there is a plot twist.  This one was quite an unexpected one for me.  I won't go forward describing this easygoing and workable film as it really would be a spoiler for anyone interested in seeing this.  You will be seeing some beautiful scenery and further explore the soundtrack (Jim Black) that starts with a bang from the beginning.  While Sandy is yelling out the song ""B**ch"" (Meredith Brooks) in her car while driving, Aram sings ""Every Time You Go Away"" (Paul Young) to Sadie so she'll fall asleep. It is always enjoyable to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in this type of role; strong and vulnerable at the same time.  She is one actress that can do this with ease while adding her razor sharp and dry wit.  Justin Bartha has the innocence and sweet qualities to flesh out the role of Aram, bringing him to life.  The two share an easy rapport and a believable chemistry for an interesting and funny view with a new twist on the May~'September' relationship. Sure, Aram is younger than Sandy, but she is only forty when they meet... hardly a May~December relationship for me.",1327708800,11,3815,4.72768532526475
4993072,5,B006JIL0AG,"Hey-film geek girl here(actually,woman)!! I watch a lot of rom-coms and it is hard to find ones that are really great throughout like this one. I have thought that Justin Bartha(and his gorgeously almost neon blue eyes)was adorable and funny ever since the 1st ""National Treasure"" movie and Catherine Zeta usually makes great film choices,this is definetely no exception. Also when I stumbled upon this in the new to video part of amazon instant,I didn't notice at first that the director was Bart Fr...Sorry,can't remember at the moment how to spell his last name. I do know that he is married to the beautiful and talented Julianne Moore and that they know about a successful relationship involving a slightly older woman. Sure can relate to liking and lusting after younger men. The chemistry between Sandy,the 40yr old mother of 2 kids that is on the rebound from a cheating,kind of awful husband and Arol(not really sure what his name was),the 25 yr old college grad,that works at a cafe and starts working for Sandy, is pretty warm and fantastic. They seem to appreciate each other and care about each other and the kids. The film doesn't rush into the walk down the aisle and quick love but reveals the strengths and passions of both of the main characters. All the travel scenery was nice too,of one of the character's,towards the end.""The Rebound"" is a wonderful example of how what makes a family beautiful and unique can vary so much. I gotta say,it makes me a little lonely and very much uplifted at the same time. It also stars other great people like Art Garfunkel as Aros' father and Lynn Whitfield as Sandy's eventual respectful,strong boss. I highly recommend this film for any hopeless romantics out there,that don't mind a little real life raunchiness and some bad words interspersed throughout.",1327622400,21,1814,4.87378640776699

4993102,5,B006JIL0AG,"I don't give many five-star reviews, and there is subjectivity of course in reviewing a romantic comedy. But this movie was so cute and moving in big and subtle ways. One of Aram and Sandys first meetings was humorously unique and revealing. Aram was in a blown-up body suit for women to practice self-defense at a womens class, and Sandy let loose on him when her anger over her divorce finally rose to the surface. They slowly got to know each other, and Aram baby-sat for her two children. And the four of them really bonded. Such a wonderful family image. Aram was over-the-top nice. Sandy was strong-willed and talented and seemed to become her diverse self after the divorce, partly with Arams support. But she was 40 and he was 25, and they had the Hollywood-inevitable big fight, but how and when they reconnected was satisfying enough to overlook the formulaic break-up.

But I read some of the 1-star reviews, so let me say
1. Yes, a little uninteresting or disjointed in the very beginning, but try not to give up after 20 minutes.
2. Yes, there were some gross or disgusting scenes worth fast-forwarding if you know they're coming (port-o-potty, dissected rat, kid throwing up).",1402790400,,1190,4.748792270531401
4993103,4,B006JIL0AG,"This was a good movie.  He is younger than she is but with age comes maturity?!  She was nervous about their age difference, he went away for several years.  When he came back,  well like all good romances, love wins out.",1402704000,,221,4.317073170731708

4993107,4,B006JIL0AG,"First off, it's hard not to like any rom-com with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Justin Bartha.  What a great match up!!  But I think the real gem of the movie isn't just how much you like them, it really is the story itself.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a gutsy mom who catches who husband cheating with her best friend and has to pick up and start life all over as a forty-something mom in NYC.  She pulls it off really well.  And I like the whole Bartha younger guy thing, falling in love with the older woman in this story.  The chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Bartha is delightful.  And without giving anything away, I really liked the ""growing up"" thing that needed to happen and how their story together gets resolved.  It is a movie well worth seeing, cute, sweet and in many ways showing how love is something that catches you off guard and doesn't fit a certain mold.

I only gave it 5 stars because it was really good and cute but I wouldn't put it up there with rom-coms like He's Just Not That Into You.  But it is really good and sweet and fun.",1382400000,2,1049,4.3061224489795915

Somehow, this film did the trick! We laughed so hard - we actually cried! I had never seen this film before. In fact, other than Catherine Zeta-Jones, I had no clue who any of the other cast members were. But...this is a cute, quirky, light-hearted comedy, which addresses so many issues for women dealing with divorce, raising children as a single-parent, and re-entering the world of dating again! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this film!! It may not be a blockbuster in most professional movie critics' eyes, but what do they know anyway!? If you haven't seen it, buy it!

They have chemistry (excellent casting by the way, that really comes through) and, as is crucial in any blended relationship, Sandy's children adore Aram, and Aram adores them back.

In fact, if there's anything that's contrived in the storyline, it's the stock SPOILER ALERT ""there must be a breakup"" section that's written in for no other reason than it seems like it always has to be. It's contrived not only because it's a cliche (ok ABF, ""clich&eacute;"" if you prefer), but because it's totally unnecessary. The two are perfect for each other.",1365033600,,822,5.2272727272727275

I won't get into the bad acting and poor scripts or the oh-so-predicatible ending, but I will say that I was very shocked with some of the content surrounding the kids in the movie.  How is it okay to shoot a scene where a mom is walking her kids to school and a bum opens his coat to display his penis to them?  That's not funny, kids should not be seeing things like that, period.  If the movie had even pretended to protect the kids from inappropriate situations, I might have enjoyed it better, but it's clear that the director wanted to shock audiences with what the kids could say/do/see.

Her husband is a domineering man whom she's never found the courage to confront. Not even when she discovers he's been cheating on her in her own home. Instead, she simply walks out with her eight-year-old daughter (Kelly Gould) and her six-year-old son (Andrew Cherry), moving from the suburbs of metropolitan New York City into the City itself. Her obsessive hobby of compiling and charting sports statistics lands her a job at a sports broadcasting station, and further good luck leads her to an very nice apartment over a coffee shop where she meets 25-year-old Aram Finklestein (played by then 30-year-old Justin Bartha,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Treasure/dp/B003QSPQ3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Treasure</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B002RVCCUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>), a barista at the coffee shop.

College-educated Aram has had multiple chances for employment as a highly paid office ""suit"" in the City, but he's opted instead to live with his parents and work at a menial job while he searches for something more meaningful to do with his life. After Sandy runs into Aram at a full-contact, self-defense class at a local woman's center, where Aram has hilariously volunteered to be the human punching bag for outraged women who've been ill-used by men, Sandy asks him to babysit her children. This one-time favor leads to his becoming her full-time nanny, and ultimately to the two of them embarking on a May-December romance.

Academy Award-winner Zeta-Jones is a brilliant dramatic actress who is equally talented at comedy. As a big fan of romantic comedy in particular, I enjoyed her very much in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America-s-Sweethearts/dp/B00003CY5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America's Sweethearts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intolerable-Cruelty/dp/B0026IYLQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intolerable Cruelty</a>&nbsp;(though the movies themselves were not among my favorites), and I was delighted to learn she had made this film. She does a very believable job playing the downtrodden Sandy. If we had entered Sandy's life before the inciting incident of her husband's cheating, we would very likely have found her a very boring person living a passive existence. However, Sandy is anything but passive during the course of this movie. Zeta-Jones convincingly portrays Sandy's extremely interesting journey from a woman made timid by low self-esteem to one who is confident in herself both personally and professionally.

Zeta-Jones also has excellent chemistry with her romantic lead, Aram (Bartha). Aram and Sandy are both struggling with similar life issues, including a painful divorce from a betraying spouse, being taken advantage of and pushed around due to a sweet, yielding disposition, and struggling to find themselves as they face a major crossroads in their lives. Aram is the kind of guy every divorced woman with kids dreams about, intelligent, thoughtful, fun to be with, great with kids, an excellent cook, and a sensitive lover.

He sounds like a saint, doesn't he? And saints are supposed to be dull characters, or so we are told. But truly he is not. Sandy is equally nice, and the audience is rooting for her to choose kind, decent Aram, whom she deserves and wants, rather than the jerky, age-appropriate men her friends urge her to date instead of Aram in order to avoid a sexist social stigma that men don't have to worry about.

I had never seen Bartha's work before viewing this movie, having missed the films he is most known for. I was very impressed with his acting, and I will certainly be on the lookout for him in the future.

Unlike several recent romantic comedies I've watched with a huge amount of--to me gratuitous--nudity (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Strings-Attached/dp/B004RC8NUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Strings Attached</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends-With-Benefits/dp/B00650SSDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends With Benefits</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Other-Drugs/dp/B004L3AR0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Other Drugs</a>), there is no nudity in this movie! Yes, there is some swearing, but I'll take that any day over endless rounds of naked bed romping.

As any romantic comedy worthy of the name should, this movie has many humorous moments, but importantly, it is quite poignant as well. It is a cliche to say, ""I laughed, I cried,"" when reviewing a movie, but the truth is, I did, and I think that's a very good thing. I believe that this is what any romantic comedy of merit attempts to achieve for its audience.

All in all, this film is a keeper in a special place of favor on my romantic-comedy shelf!",1337817600,12,5542,6.592592592592593

I have to admit the first time I watched it I had to fast forward through some scenes. The ""F"" word is mentioned some. Not sure how many times because I muted through them (and it starts right from the beginning) The movie in my oppinion had some unnecessary crudeness for my taste but.... the romance in the movie is so good it left you wanting so much more and way out shined the language and crudeness) The chemistry between Catherine Zeta Jones and Justin Bartha just worked so wonderfully. I have watched this movie 3 times already this week and want to watch it again. You fall so in love with Aram's character. It's so rare to see a guy so faithfully devoted to his true love these days. His character made the movie. Catherine Zeta Jones did an outstanding job as well. The kids were funny too. The bowling scene was one of my favorites. For couples or women that are looking for something to do on a weekend or afternoon by themselves this is the perfect romance movie. (as long as you can handle the crudeness factor and a little language.)I still give it 5 stars because it left me wanting more.... More romance...more Aram.",1332460800,8,1266,4.461206896551724

I liked both leading characters and for once the male leading character didn't have to be a jerk.  The movie works because it has two main characters that genuinely care about each other without being condescending, rude or manipulative toward each other.  Some dialogues from the children was unnecessarily explicit but it wasn't enough to affect the movie.  The ending was simple and it complimented the story beautifully.  I rented this movie from Netflix and ended up purchasing a Blu ray from Amazon.  I give this movie a 5 stars simply because it was very entertaining.",1332115200,2,724,4.837398373983739

In romantic comedies it either works out in the end or it doesn't and there aren't really that many variations on those outcomes. They have beats of coming together, going apart, and coming back together that we are familiar with. This one though dispenses with the tried and true stock ending and makes a simpler much more elegant and satisfying ending. An excellent movie for what it is.

4993145,5,B006JIL0AG,"In the first few minutes of the film it develops the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones, a person who takes pride in her mother-hood and woman-hood. And she loves sports. Every guys dream...except for her husband. She moves to clean version of NYC (did they sweep the sidewalks before shooting?) and quickly finds an apartment and a job, perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film. Justin Bartha's character is developed right after the credits by a quick conversation with his parents(Art Garfunkel and Joanna Gleason). The break-up has Catherine off balance. She has developed some real emotional issues, apparently due to some male dependency feelings. Both of them are on ""the rebound"" as Justin becomes the nanny. Catherine is 15 years older than Justin.

Alice Playten as Sensei Dana was great. I couldn't stop laughing at her scene as a Woman's Center instructor. Catherine's first date was another LOL moment at simple toilet humor taken to a different level. At this point, the film was 5 stars on the strength of those scenes. Later, it appears the writers painted themselves into a corner and didn't know how to end the film, which seemed a bit forced. I may have enjoyed the film more with Demi and Ashton, but that would be too much to ask. Catherine is convincing in her role, the rest of the characters less so, as the film clearly centers around her.

4993147,4,B006JIL0AG,"The Rebound was never released in theaters. It went straight to DVD because of distibution issues. I am a fan of Catherine Zeta-Jones. I have been since The Darling Buds of May period. So, that was my main interest in getting this movie. Catherine is terrific as Sandy. She really carries the movie and helps guide the story all the way through. Her character is strong, interesting, and funny. Sandy is also trying for work her way through the hurt of being cheated on by her husband. She starts a new life with her 2 kids. Justin Bartha is charming and likeable in this movie. He someone manages to find good chemistry with Catherine. Although, I don't think his acting is strong enough to carry on a leading man role in all instances. I personally find him dull and bland at times. But, he still works well in this movie and does an admirable job with Catherine and the 2 kids. There are likeable supporting characters in this movie including his parents (father played by Art Garfunkel) The movie makes an honest attempt at presenting a relationship between a kind young man and an older woman who is trying to pursue a career, raise two kids, but also find love again. Catherine Zeta-Jones displays a great talent for being funny, strong yet vulnerable in these kinds of films. You find yourself really caring about her. The Rebound does have weak spots. And, there are elements of romantic comedy cliches at work. The potty humor, especially early on in the film, is kind of stupid. Sandy's date with the chiropractor(John Schneider) tries too hard to be funny with crude humor and just doesn't work. Plus, I found Sandy's two kids to be something out of a tv sitcom. They annoyed me much of the time. But, they did temper down a bit as the film progressed. But, The Rebound does do a fine job exploring the relationship between the lead couple. And, the movie does have a lot of sweet moments and charm. The ending is kind of odd. But, perhaps, in a good way. The Rebound is an above-average romantic comedy that I will recommend. Not a masterpiece. But, a nice movie to watch. A better recent romantic comedy that Catherine appears in would be 2007's No Reservations. Which, I highly recommend. Or, Intolerable Cruelty with George Clooney from a few years back. But, if you are a Catherine Zeta Jones fan. Or, even a Justin Bartha fan.

I did like how this movie had the typical male/female roles reversed and that made it a little different then the other movies like this. The one down side is the ending.
