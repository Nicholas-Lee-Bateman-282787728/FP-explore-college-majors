8197859,5,B000QWAIYA,"Given the epidemic of bullying, this video should be required viewing for teachers of young and middle school children.  A very moving account by successful and diverse people about the struggles they faced growing up at the hands of bullying and homophobic children. Their pain was caused and compounded by adults who stood by and did nothing. An important and timely discussion; really well done.  Please, can someone get this onto DVD?",1286582400,,438,5.069444444444445
