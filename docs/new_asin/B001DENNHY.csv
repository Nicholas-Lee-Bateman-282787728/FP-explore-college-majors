This DVD is the answer!

Unlike some dancers who are more interested in impressing you with their moves, instead of teaching you how to do them, dance instructor,Shuaib Grant a.k.a. Krazy Pop, stands out. This foundational DVD is as ""idiot proof"" as it gets. Krazy Pop, has a humorous, conversational way of teaching that puts you immediately at ease. He demonstrates each move slowly and numerous times to insure that you get it. Physically, his tall, lean  body makes visibility very easy when he demonstrates movements.  The beginner will be able to learn these skills within minutes, and even the advance student will be able to add a few moves to his dance vocabulary.
