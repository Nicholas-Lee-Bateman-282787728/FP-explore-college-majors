3546956,5,B001E77XMQ,"Warning, as of today(Dec. 28th'09), this box set may be missing disc#14 which contains the halloween special plus 2 ""best of"" episodes.  Disc #13 and #14 are duplicates despite their outward appearances.  I ordered this for my wife for Christmas, started the return process the next day and just got the replacement which still has the same problem.  The box of the replacement is a little banged up, so I'm not sure if amazon just sent out one that another customer returned or what.  Other than that, if you like Criss Angel and want all the seasons so far, this is a great item. Neither amazon or the criss angel website have acknowledged this problem thus far.  Personally, I'd wait until the end of Jan. 2010 to purchase this just in case.",1261958400,15,744,4.606060606060606

3546958,5,B001E77XMQ,"He never ceases to amaze and I hope I get to see him live. My 6 year old grandson has watched it with me several times and wants to be a magician now. He does the simple tricks taught on the video and we ordered his magic kit and plan to get the 6th season soon. He is a serious mindfreak, and cute as a bug.",1295481600,,308,3.6818181818181817
3546959,5,B001E77XMQ,"I must say, I only discovered Criss Angel about a year and a half ago and I must say I am really impressed. As a fan of magic, I'm usually really critical when it comes to demonstrations, especially over TV. But over and over again, he proves that he is the real deal. 5 seasons at that price is a good deal for new and old fans.",1294617600,,329,3.925373134328358
3546960,3,B001E77XMQ,"Will try to review the DVD's rather than Criss Angel, but I will say one sentence about the man:  An amazing performer who--among David Copperfield, Lance Burton, David Blaine, and Penn&Teller--has done for the art of magic what Tiger Woods (ahem) did for golf which is to say he's made it exciting to watch again.  The set's box comes with a bit of a cheesy pop-up based on C.A.'s infamous buzz-sawed-in-half routine.  I can't say I've gotten to watch all the DVD's, but I did pop all of them in to verify they weren't damaged.  It's interesting to see his evolution across 4 seasons and then some.  They say the set contains the last 5 seasons (2010 and he's currently in season 6) and I'll have to take their word for it.  I bought the set primarily because I didn't have time for A&E every week but I definitely want to see all the tricks, especially the smaller production ""street"" stuff which are more impressive illusions to me than the big ""escape"" stunts.  There's about 3 DVD's for seasons 1-4 and 3 more DVD's of ""theme"" material like the 5 Lives of Criss Angel.  Fifteen altogether.  Sad to say, as has been reported by others, there is no Halloween special DVD.  DVD 14 = DVD 13.  Bummer.  The fault of A&E's disc producer I imagine and not C.A.  Still, the set is a must-buy for anyone who considers themselves an afficionado of magic.  Mindfreak!  Mindfreak!  Are you ready?",1289606400,6,1389,4.540322580645161
3546961,5,B001E77XMQ,for 36 hours for $20 is amazing deal. Chris is a cool dude and the show is funny as hell. Most of it is staged. But its funny as hell to laugh and enjoy,1284249600,,152,3.5
3546962,5,B001E77XMQ,This was a great purchase.  Everything as promised for the best price I had seen anywhere.  The only problem is that disc 13 and 14 were the same. All in all we are very happy with the set.,1284163200,,189,3.9473684210526314
3546963,4,B001E77XMQ,"Criss Angel is not a run of the mill stage magician who wears a tux and pulls rabbits out of a silk top hat.  He works outside the usual milieu--in malls, on the street, in the park, in a vacant lot.  He is an escape artist, a daredevil, and an illusionist first class.  Not that he cannot do mundane card tricks or disappearing coins.  He can and sometimes does.  I know of no other performer who does all of what he does.  David Blaine comes closest but is still short.

That said, Angel looks vaguely--well--soiled.  His black hair (with sometimes purple highlights) is long and stringy and looks greasy.  There's a load of cheap bling around his neck and on his fingers that have the nails painted black.  He screams for no particular reason. His clothes are mostly black/Gothic, and sometimes tattered.  In short he has all the appearance of some druggie rock star.  I suppose that young viewers can appreciate all that, but I can't quite handle it.  Call it the prejudice of an old man, if you will.

I wouldn't suggest that he change his persona, however.  It works apparently with his audience, and I'm just one vote for a cleaner, quieter, trimmer Criss.",1284076800,,1163,4.577669902912621
3546964,4,B001E77XMQ,"I've been taping Mindfreak from the very first day. I have all his shows plus whatever specials/shows he was in that I could pick up. When I saw this collectors package and the price I thought ""WOW"". But after viewing it I think I got more from taping the show.
Don't get me wrong..........its a great package. And anyone who's a fan of Mindfreak this would be a plus for their collection. Even though I have taped it all before, I will keep this collection too! It was worth every penny.",1283212800,2,488,4.373626373626373
3546965,5,B001E77XMQ,"It was great!  He's the best Illusionist in the whole world.  Of course, I'm an Ultimate Loyal of his, so what else can I say?!",1283126400,,127,4.04
3546966,4,B001E77XMQ,"Are you a Criss Angel fan? Do you really love Mindfreak enough to buy the complete DVD collection? Since you're visiting this page you're either considering buying this collector's edition box set or simply curious which are both a step forward in owning this set. I was surprised at the price of this collector's set, for a complete series of five seasons and some extras this is pretty cheap (keep in mind you get 15 discs after all). I didn't buy mine from amazon but instead at an HMV store for 69.99$ so I'd say price-wise amazon is better. Normally I wouldn't have bought a complete series set but this one was inexpensive for what it was and I'm a huge fan of Criss Angel and his illusions, it seems I can never get enough. I like Criss'illusions and what he does but he's just a great person and he never claims to be a magician and he's rather an illusionist, whatever he is he's certainly interesting to watch. The Criss Angel Collectors Edition DVD Set contains 15 discs overall (of which two are the exact same copies, 13 and 14, however the problem doesn't seem to be taken notice of much)of the first five seasons of Mindfreak as well as comentaries, featurettes(Angel shows us tricks, celebrity guests,interviews,pratical jokes and more) additional footage of season five and finally an extra disc of 6 never-released episodes(including two ""best of"" episodes,a great add). It's just unfortunate that the ""included"" Halloween show is not included because of duplicate discs, however the rest more than makes up for it.

This collector's set would be perfect if not for the fact that disc 13 and 14 are duplicates (which is why I'm rating it four stars and not five), however everything else about the box set is excellent. I like the box and its presentation; the package is basically two DVD season set boxes that hang together from which the cases containing the discs are located slip and when you open the set you have a picture of criss that covers both boxes. It's a great package at a great price what can I say? (just consider the duplicates discs)You get over 36 hours of Mindfreak with this collectors box, worthy for a hardcore fan. Four stars.",1281052800,3,2170,4.680628272251309
3546967,5,B001E77XMQ,"I purchased this set this june and I have to admit that I was a bit scared what I will find there because I thought it was suspiciously cheap considering what everything is supposed to be here and how much you have to pay for the single season. Well, I was more than happy when it came. I can surely recommend this for everyone who likes Criss Angel. And even though I don't like spending so much money, I can gladly say it was more than worth it. There are all five seasons, a lot of bonus material and also Halloween special. Simply perfect!",1279670400,2,543,4.230769230769231
8297050,4,B001E77XMQ,"Not sure if this is still an issue with production with other distributors, but I also had the duplicate discs. Instead of the Halloween Special, it is disc 13 again. Everything else was fine. :)",1381017600,,195,4.6
8297051,5,B001E77XMQ,I have been watching this non-stop. You cant beat it for the price. It is worth every penny. If you are in to magic or want to try and figure out if he is a fake and how he does it I would sugest to buy this.,1378252800,,208,3.4468085106382977
8297052,3,B001E77XMQ,Good collection disc 13 and 14 are the same and the plastic holding the disc on on my second part was broken which was a bummer but ill get over that wish this didn't have the defect oh well still great collection for the price need to update description to show defect,1364169600,,269,4.1923076923076925
8297053,4,B001E77XMQ,i got this for my husband for his birthday he is a big criss angel fan. we watched the 1st disk and it work good. But i rememeber people saying that 13 and 14 are duplicates so i put both the disks in to check and yep they are duplicates i was disppointed we were excited for the halloween episodes and considering so many people told amazon about the problem I thought it would be fix. other than disk 13 and 14 being duplicates this is a great collection for the price for any criss angel fan.,1362355200,,495,4.11340206185567
8297054,1,B001E77XMQ,"For me, as the series progressed the show got too flashy and the absurdity of the stunts became too great. While I can't say for certain that most of the show is completely manufactured fakery for television, there is some strong evidence to indicate it is. Still, amidst the showpiece illusions, Angel shows he's a talented street magician, but even that wears thin. This collection of all things Angel however, serves no specific purpose aside from bilking loyal fans out of cash to get episodes missing from the previous season three release. Couple that with a major manufacturing error and I can't, in good faith, recommend shelling out your cash for this set. If you have a passing interest in Angel it would make a great rental, but be warned, the more you watch of him over a short period of time, what suspension of disbelief there is quickly erodes. Everyone else, stick to the reruns or DVDs already in your collection.",1359417600,,930,4.746913580246914

8297056,5,B001E77XMQ,"I'm not even halfway through the Seasons yet of this Mindfreak DVD Set, but I can say It is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  Criss Angel is the Houdini of the new Millenium and an amazing illusionist.  He is incredible.  Unlike some previous reviews, the DVD set I received had all the DVD's including the Halloween special.  If you're a Chris Angel fan, you will enjoy this DVD set.  Seasons 1-5 with additional special additions makes this great value for the price!  In Canada, this DVD set is going for $100!  This set did not disappoint.",1314403200,,552,4.628865979381444
8297057,5,B001E77XMQ,"I just got the Mindfreak Collector's Edition in the mail today. I just put in disc 13 and 14 to see if they were the same and they are not! Disc 14 is the Halloween episode. I've only watched the first disc straight through, but I just wanted to get the word out that it seems the issue with disc 14 being a duplicate of disc 13 is no longer a problem.",1310688000,5,352,3.9027777777777777
8297058,5,B001E77XMQ,"The Mindfreak box set that I bought was a gift for my girlfriends son!

I got this as a gift for someone and found out afterwards about the problem.",1302825600,,254,4.291666666666667
