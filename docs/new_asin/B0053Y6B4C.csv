8455923,4,B0053Y6B4C,I had heard about this movie for many years and finally got the chance to buy it on Amazon. It's one of those so bad it's good movies! Yes it rips off The Exorcist but so what... It's definitely worth the money.,1526774400,,211,4.0476190476190474
8455924,3,B0053Y6B4C,Abby was indicative of the movies of the 70s. Not A+ but exspected and enjoyed. The other movie could of been excluded if you watch it for a number of reasons. Wish it wasn't a double feature.,1483833600,,192,4.216216216216216

It plays great.",1483574400,,59,4.0
8455926,4,B0053Y6B4C,"I saw this movie when it was first released in the theatre back in the 70's. I had the memory, thereof. But, over the years, the experience waned. Nonetheless, I knew I saw ""Abby"". But, when the opportunity to get the movie was a reality, I wanted a copy of this movie, because, this is a classic from the Black Exploitation era of the mid to late 70's. The video transfer is not DVD/BluRay quality; but, it STILL gave me a chance to see the film in all its, for a lack of a better term, drive-in quality. THEN, I remembered ""Abby"". Honestly, although the director/producer of THE EXORCIST sought to ban its release, I can see certain elements used from ""Abby"" in the 'new' version of THE EXORCIST with many of its subliminal inserts. Is ""Abby"" a great movie? No. Is ""Abby"" a cheap copy of a classic? It pays homage to an original and sets itself apart by adding an ethnic backstory.  ""Abby"" stands alone as a horror classic from the 70's. Hey, horror classics can be B or C movies, right? Nonetheless, for all of its inherit history, this is one to have in your collection, IF your are a collector.",1475107200,3,1099,4.387254901960785

8455928,5,B0053Y6B4C,Good 'ole 70's movie. Although it was billed as a horror flick. I was rolling with laughter,1405296000,,91,4.411764705882353
8455929,5,B0053Y6B4C,"Magdalena Possessed By The Devil is the greatest.  The Exorcist only wishes it could live up to this classic slice of insanity.  Blam Pow Boop!  This thang will hit you upside your head with a tire iron when you ain't looking.  Unbelievably unbelievable.  Euro Sleaze at its finest.  It makes Gigli look like Glitter.  Well, actually, Gigli and Glitter probably look alike anyway.  Regardless, this one has it all.  Naked seductive possessed girl becomes an American success story in this post turn of the century pre millennium madness in Europe.  Fantastic!  No home should be without it.  Snakes!
Abby pretty dang fine as well.",1379635200,4,630,4.951923076923077
8455930,4,B0053Y6B4C,"I had been looking for this movie for a very long time and found it here on amazon. It's a great old movie, but the picture quality isn't that great. It would be wonderful if the restore it. Love Amazon",1354838400,7,202,4.075
