2311425,1,B0009PW4CI,"There is no way you can ever compare this d-grade movie to one of the best classics ever, Steinbeck's The Pearl.  For one, Kino, as a young boy starts out ""white"", then grown up, he becomes Mexican/Indian with a bad looking tan.  The actors are all white, with tanned makeup, the language is way off-key, without a hint of true accent.  The plot is not memorable, nor sincere to the book.  But for the whitewashing of Hollywood, ironically, the Director is Mexican.  What happened there??!!

If you have read this wonderful book, you can see that watching this movie is no reflection.  And it is easy to understand that the ""book version"" of many movies doesn't compare, but this is simply a different story.  Don't even try it.  Steinbeck would not only turn over in his grave, he would jump out!!  .....Rizzo",1171584000,19,810,4.640845070422535
2311426,1,B0009PW4CI,"I made it through a whole 15 minutes of this movie before turning it off.  What a horrible adaptation of a truly great story.  The acting was horrible and I don't think they had a casting director.  It looked like they walked out into the street and said, ""you, you and you - no acting required."" I could not sit through this movie and watch them murder one of my favorite stories.  Bypass this one and please, please, don't show this in class - you will kill any child's desire to ever read Steinbeck!",1169424000,6,502,4.308510638297872
2311427,4,B0009PW4CI,"Vivid scenery.  Excellent picture.  However, the script was not true to the text that my class is reading; too many ""innovations"".

Also, I wish the DVD could be shipped overseas.",1168300800,3,179,4.9
2311428,4,B0009PW4CI,"This was a good movie. Much better than the old one in black and white. However, the ending is different than the book. My students enjoyed watching it after we read the book. It led to a great lesson on comparison between the book and the movie. Had they watched the movie and not read the book, they would have failed the written test!",1166659200,5,337,4.28125
2311429,4,B0009PW4CI,"The DVD ""The Pearl"" directed by Alfred Zacharias is an excellent adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel.  However, one could be misled if the liner notes were to be trusted.

The notes suggest that  ""the peasant is soon engulfed by greed, envy and betrayal,"" when in fact the peasant was the victim of the greed, envy and betrayal of the upper class. The peasant was presented as an ideal of humanity. Indeed, the entire film depicted the simple peasant life as ideal and pure, while the life of the upper class was gluttonous, depraved, and sinful.

The movie and the book suggest the the peasant may have to make the ultimate sacrifice, interpretted as either the loss of his child or the loss of his life.  The liner notes affirm that ""in order to achieve his dreams, he may have to make life's ultimate sacrifice.""

In the end he throws the pearl away. This is not an ultimate sacrifice, but a most practical one. And one, I might add, that his wife sought to make earlier in the film.

On the whole, it is an excellent DVD and quite faithful to the original novel.",1141344000,12,1075,4.510309278350515
2311430,1,B0009PW4CI,"I am also an English teacher and a Steinbbeck researcher.  The film adaptation makes absolutely no sense.  We open the movie with a scene created only for the movie and it appears as if Kino is from white, European descent.  As he matures, however, he becomes Hispanic with a horrible accent and Mickey Mouse ears to boot!  The film has added in ""love"" scenes not present in the book and basically made a farce out of Steinbeck's beloved work!  If I had to guess, one of the creators and/or directors of one of the Monty Python movies took on this project with outrageous comedy in mind!  It was a sure disappointment, even to my students who did not read the book in its entirety!",1131494400,15,681,4.451612903225806
2311431,3,B0009PW4CI,"I am also an English teacher and I was thrilled to learn of this film adaptation.  Even after reading the other two reviews I was excited to show this to my students after we finished our reading, and the changes that the film makes are interesting rather than disappointing.  One of the projects that I offer to my students is to change the storyline to fit their interests, including the ending, and I presented this film as one person's vision.  I love the way it starts with Kino as a little boy listening to his father's advice, and I like the actor who is cast as Kino the grown man.  I like how his brother Juan has a larger role.  In fact, I like the happy ending because it is something I used to discuss with my students, asking them how things could have been resolved differently.  Richard Harris is wonderful as the shrewd doctor, and the scene where he ""buys"" eternal salvation from the priest is excellent.  Yes, it is always preferable to see a faithful adaptation of a novel, but it doesn't ruin the fact that I can enhance my own and my students' appreciation of a great story.",1127433600,37,1095,4.417910447761194
2311432,1,B0009PW4CI,"As an English teacher, I was very eager to purchase this modern adaptation of Steinbeck's novella to show to students.  Imagine my shock and horror when I discovered this film has a HAPPY ending!  Hollywood has totally changed the impact of Steinbeck's original work to satisfy those who need to walk out of a movie experience with a smile on their faces...unfortunately, a smile isn't what people will walk out with after viewing this film.  Very disappointing!",1126396800,55,462,4.974025974025974

2311435,3,B0009PW4CI,"So it says.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  I really liked this video, unfortunately stories don't always have happy endings like this video did.  It was interesting that this video places the local doctor as the villian, and it makes for an interesting plot.",1382918400,,266,4.739130434782608
2311436,2,B0009PW4CI,"I eagerly put this in to watch with my parents (having found a VHS at the thrift store for $.49)  I was glad I paid only that, but sorry I wasted our time.  We were irritated and  very disappointed that it is not the Steinbeck story. Part of the power of the novella is the story's tightness (very small book) and economy of word usage. This movie was padded with lots of junk that isn't in the novel and serves only to choke the life out of the story.  The lead actor was fine as a child actor in Witness, but wasn't at all up to the part. The lead female was also very static.  My father noted that the version to see is the classic Mexican cinema 1947 version, La Perla, with Pedro Armendariz (which I see is available on Amazon).  He remembered the film from back in the day and says it is excellent and the one to see.  Alas, it is in Spanish with NO SUBTITLES.  If anyone out there has some friends in the business, could you please arrange a re-release with English sub-titles?  Thank you.",1381363200,,996,4.2
2311437,1,B0009PW4CI,"Why is it that the newer generation of actors are such crap.  The original version of The Pearl, produced, I believe in the late 1950's is the only version you should see.  RELEASE IT CORPORATION CRAP HEADS....",1378857600,,210,4.648648648648648
2311438,1,B0009PW4CI,"I am a teacher and I wanted to show the film version of The Pearl to my students.
This turned out to be very educational as we pointed out all the problems the film had compared to the novella by Steinbeck. We had a great discussion about the bad acting and lack of symbolism, how they could have done scenes differently to retain the author's original intention.

The symbolism of the original story was portrayed very literally in the production.
For example: In the film version, Kino asks Juana, ""What's wrong?"" and she replies, ""I hear the song of the enemy."" Then they stand in place and blankly look about the room for ""something."" Then they see a scorpion over by Coyotito's bed.

Also, they completely change the ending, other aspects of the story and they combine a lot of characters which affects the meaning. I assume that many of those things were done because of a very small budget which affected how many actors they could hire, and possibly the quality of actors they could get.

FYI
There is a Mexican & American version of The Pearl in Spanish which came out in 1947. The screenplay was co-written by Steinbeck and directed by Emilio Fernndez. There are clips online, but I have not found a DVD copy. If you can get your hands on it, that would be much, much better!",1373068800,2,1285,4.530172413793103
2311439,5,B0009PW4CI,The 1947 Mexican version is also a good movie.  I always like to show the movie to complete a novel unit.,1369872000,,105,4.0
2311440,1,B0009PW4CI,"Had hoped to supplement the reading of John Steinbeck's novel with a diverse high school classroom (diverse in race, social-economics. etc.). Instead, found myself apologizing for making the class watch the movie. This wasn't just a poor adaption of a classic. This movie was just tacky, absurdly tacky, actually.",1366329600,,313,5.408163265306122

2311442,2,B0009PW4CI,"I read John Steinbeck's novel with my class of tenth graders and then decided to show them the film version.  I wanted them to pay attention to the differences between the book and movie since there are always some.  However, it turns out that there are more differences than there are similarities.  It was as if they wrote a whole new story line, and I didn't see the purpose of doing so.  If you plan on showing this movie in conjunction with the book: don't.  Maybe the movie is alright on its own...hard to say since I read the book and it paled in comparison.",1345507200,3,565,4.3428571428571425
2311443,1,B0009PW4CI,"Buy this DVD, pop open a bottle of beer (or a root beer if you are not yet 21), sit back, and be prepared to LAUGH YOUR A** OFF!
It is HYSTERICAL!
GASP!!! Dog barking! Hark? What is that sound?! It is...<da da da DAAAAA>
THE MUSIC OF EVIL! Yes, you can actually hear what the music of evil sounds like, only it sounds more like the music of HILARITY, thanks to the corny sound track. I guess it had to be corny to fit in with the props, acting, directing...
Lukas Haas - LUKAS HAAS! - with his ears and SPRAY TAN and not even an attempt at an accent playing a Mexican Native...AHHHHHHAHAHHAHA!
And then there's the plastic baby scene, the pearl with the glowing halo, the WIG (looks like the same hair donned by the Indian healer lady appears on a guy portraying a pearl buyer who looks an awful lot like Ricardo Montalban (in a really BAD gray mullet-head wig), the vanilla yogurt baby vomit (you may never eat vanilla yogurt again), and poor Richard Harris; a friend surmises that he must have had some hefty medical bills to pay and took the part out of sheer desperation. He neglects his character's French accent from time to time and lapses back into sounding exactly like Dumbledore. I suspect the glowing, golf ball size pearl may have thrown him off as it could very well have been a golden snitch sans wings.
Then there's the fight scene in the hut, which defies written description.
I've seen part of the movie in an English class. My copy should be here in a few days....going to sit down with a pia colada and some chips and salsa and a box of tissues (for the tears....of laughter).
Some excerpts from a few of the wittier reviews on Amazon:
"" Kino, as a young boy starts out ""white"", then grown up, he becomes Mexican/Indian with a bad looking tan""
""We open the movie with a scene created only for the movie and it appears as if Kino is from white, European descent. As he matures, however, he becomes Hispanic with a horrible accent and Mickey Mouse ears to boot... If I had to guess, one of the creators and/or directors of one of the Monty Python movies took on this project with outrageous comedy in mind!""
"" Haas is about as convincing a Mexican pearl diver (pick either- Mexican or pearl diver)as a plastic Coke bottle in a sombrero. The dialogue is an ATROCIOUS mix of half-forgotten accents delivering a discussion between modern-day teen-aged car mechanics and the Frito Bandito. The music made me cry ...in pain.""
""My vote for the three silliest moments: The clam emitting some sort of yellow magical light just before Kino finds the pearl; Kino getting the crap beaten out of him until Juana walks up and then the bad guys run away; Kino, and this is a classic for all-time illogical moments in cinema, Kino using the pearl for a flash light just before he discovers the skeletons in a cave. I had to whittle it down to just the three silliest moments.""

So, as long as you're not planning on taking this seriously, buy it: laughter is good for the body and soul.
If Steinbeck is watching from the great beyond, I sure hope he has a terrific sense of humor.
Oh...my vote for best actor: the dog
Best supporting actor: the goat
The baby gets an honorable mention (the real baby - not the plastic one with the darker skin in the different outfit) as he really was crying - probably because he was extremely angry at his real parents for ruining his career before he could even speak or crawl.",1336694400,3,3416,4.439490445859873
2311444,4,B0009PW4CI,I purchased this movie to go along with the novella which I teach.  My students enjoyed this movie but are always quick to point out that it strays away from the book somewhat.  Overall this is a good movie.,1312675200,,207,4.282051282051282
2311445,2,B0009PW4CI,"The movie itself was not entirely true to the book, which was disappointing since I'm currently teaching it to my Special Ed high school class.  This version would confuse them more than help them, I think.  The seller, however, was very helpful and sent it to me in a timely manner.  Thanks to them.",1306108800,,300,4.518518518518518
2311446,2,B0009PW4CI,"Make no mistake about it, this movie is pretty bad.  But the over-the-top heavy handedness in handling symbolism (much of it clumsily duct-taped onto the original), over emphasis of emotive detail, and amazingly stupid use of special effects can actually be used in the class room to underscore the skillful use of literary elements by a true artist. Steinbeck comes off very well in comparison.

There is almost a place for this film in the hearts of those who love low-budget monster/sci-fi from the 1950's.  But, for the most part, the production qualities (it is beautifully shot) deny such camp qualifications.

My vote for the three silliest moments: The clam emitting some sort of yellow magical light just before Kino finds the pearl; Kino getting the crap beaten out of him until Juana walks up and then the bad guys run away; Kino, and this is a classic for all-time illogical moments in cinema, Kino using the pearl for a flash light just before he discovers the skeletons in a cave.  I had to whittle it down to just the three silliest moments.

This movie was so bad that it helped to break the tension in having to deal with serious literature - we all laughed about it together.

In a way that made it a useful experience.  It showed the merits of the book more clearly.",1306022400,2,1285,4.629955947136564
2311447,3,B0009PW4CI,"I purchased this DVD to show to my students who had finished reading John Steinbeck's novel, The Pearl.

The video is beautifully filmed. The opening is very important and reflects the atmosphere of the story in Baja, California (which is in Mexico). The colours , the straw houses, the fish, the village, the neighbours' proximity to each other.
There are differences in the book and the film. Some I like. Some I don't.

2311450,1,B0009PW4CI,"I bought this DVD from a pawn shop as USED for $2 and I feel ripped off...and nausously sorry for Richard Harris. Haas is about as convincing a Mexican pearl diver (pick either- Mexican or pearl diver)as a plastic Coke bottle in a sombrero. The dialogue is an ATROCIOUS mix of half-forgotten accents delivering a discussion between modern-day teen-aged car mechanics and the Frito Bandito. The music made me cry ...in pain. Harris was made out as a scurrying, cartoon-like, Snidely Whiplash-ish villian to the point of my personal embarassment. The ""action"" was like watching an algebra lesson on PBS... a drawn out chase scene thru the desert actually had me admiring/identifying the various cactii rather than rooting for the home team. While I pride myself on always finishing a movie, and my tastes often run outside the mainstream or against the critics, I was wondering who the he11 screenwrote or directed this mess by the first 15 minutes and couldn't stop myself from fast forwarding thru the last 20 to just make it all go away!

2311451,2,B0009PW4CI,"I teach this novel in junior high and the students love it; unfortunately I could not recall a video/dvd other than the black and white version from the 1930's. When I searched youtube for an idea for students to make their own video, I discovered this version and was so excited!  Richard Harris has been one of my favorite actors since Camelot and A Man Named Horse (plus the Harry Potter movies). After viewing The Pearl, I was saddened and disappointed at how the screenplay writers changed up the story, making the greedy, obese doctor of the novel into a feeble-minded, stool pigeon in cahoots with the priest and pearl buyers to swindle Kino out of his ""pearl of the world"". The scene with Harris running back and forth looking to see if Kino is on his way to the pearl buyer is ridiculous! The screenwriters also added a woman in the doctor's bedroom which will surely have to be ""fast forwarded"" IF I dare to show my students. Just before I found out about this version of the movie made from the novel, I was telling the librarian about the book and she and I were both wondering why Hollywood had not grabbed this fantastic story and made a major motion picture out of it. Now I know why....someone took this story and made a mess out of it.  The surprise ending was also changed in the movie. This is an unjustice to Mr. Steinbeck almost as pitiful as the way Hollywood changed the last scene from The Grapes of Wrath. The original endings are SHOCKING  but I guess Hollywood wanted a happier ending. Steinbeck surely has rolled over in his grave!",1279411200,,1559,4.501766784452297

2311459,3,B0009PW4CI,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am an English teacher and was very pleased to find this adaptation to use with my 9th grade class.  I have used the 1947 version but old black and white films tend to be heavy going for young audiences.  This version is nowhere near as satisfying as I would like, but to break down the likes and dislikes:
It offers great visuals for the town, the village and the trek through the wilderness. It also offers good visuals for pearl diving.
The pond fight with the tracker is  changed from the book but builds suspense nicely.
Most of the actors, expecially Tarin, Harris, and Rivero are very good in my opinion.  Unlike some other reviewers, I like the added love scenes for Kino and Juana.  They are a young couple and in love.  It's nice for that to be seen,  although I could do without the heavy breathing scene!
On the negative side:
While Lucas Haas is acceptable as Kino, I find it very, very difficult to believe they couldn't have found a Latino actor better suited to the part. I show this movie to a young class of largely hispanic background; they know the difference! This is no longer the 1950's where you just smear brown makeup on white actors to make them ""ethnic"".
I very much dislike the whole idea of the happy ending, as others have pointed out.  Steinbeck clearly states repeatedly in the text that Kino and his kind are discriminated against,oppressed,  and cheated from cradle to grave. That message is far from totally outdated even 60 years later. Frankly, I view the throwing away of the pearl as Kino's surrender to a system he now thinks it is not possible to escape rather than as any kind of victory of the common man. To lose that idea loses a great deal of the novel's strength in my opinion.
I also am not crazy about identifying all the villiany so clearly with the character of the doctor.  I certainly am not convinced the doctor in the book would have the energy or the brains to be so wicked. I do understand it is a way to build up the role for a name actor like Harris so I can accept it. However, it certainly defeats the purpose of having the envy of the nameless, faceless surrounding community become one of Kino's main sources of conflict.
So, all that said, I continue to show this film, but certainly not until after the book is read and as a means of discussion about the points I believe Steinbeck meant to make.",1212969600,3,2397,4.427272727272728

2311461,1,B0009PW4CI,"When I saw that The Pearl had been made into a movie I was hopeful that it would follow the beautifully-written story.  Unfortunately, using ""based on"" in the credits means that Hollywood decided to stray from the original.  I work with ESL students and believed that seeing the story in movie form might make it easier for them to understand but I had to do too much censoring to make it acceptable for my 8th graders.

The cinematography was very good but the characters did not fit the physical appearance of the people in John Steinbeck's timeless story.  The actress who played Juana was the most authentic character in the film.

The overblown musical score and cgi special effects, make it all too fake. Lukas Haas was not a good choice as the native pearl diver. His emaciated frame and dumbo-esque ears do not fit the bill for the role. He is like a gawky pre-teen scarecrow compared to his voluptuous film wife.

8065170,2,B0009PW4CI,"This version of The Pearl is garbage. The acting is woefully bad, as to be comical. The special effects are from generations ago, and the film itself, though shot in 2001, looks as if it were a recolored black and white feature from the 1950's. It just clearly was not a large budget production. The dialog is inaudible at points, totaling about a third of the entire movie. You can tell from the context what was said, but in relation to the musical score, the dialog is very quiet.

This is a sub-par performance from Lukas Haas, but worry not, he is just fine, I mean, he went on to do Inception, so everyone in the industry kindly forgot this black mark on his career. He is embarrassingly bad in this movie. He is clearly attempting to be ethnic, but in no way does it read ""Mexican"". However, very few of the actors actually came across as authentic.

Besides a hard to watch Lukas Haas, Alfred Sacharias (Writer & Director) decided to do something which Hollywood does far too often. He changed the ending of the story, in such a way as to render the allegory that Steinbeck wrote completely ineffectual. Sacharias had the golden nectar of one of the great American authors, and he ruined it by going for the happy ending. The story is partly a cautionary tale, and Sacharias completely misses the mark.",1470268800,2,1310,4.546610169491525
8065171,4,B0009PW4CI,"I had to buy this movie as a summer reading project comparing the book and the movie. The reason I gave this movie a 4 star is because like most movies, it changes the plot a bit to make it more enjoyable to the viewer. But for this movie, it drastically changed the plot and basically added a whole new section to the movie that was not in the book. The graphics were great for their time and it was overall a fine movie.",1462579200,,422,4.035714285714286
8065172,2,B0009PW4CI,"This is a pretty terrible rendition as the director took a lot of creative turns from the story. The acting is so bad that my 7th graders laughed at the fraudulent suspense. I was able to spin it into a fun activity with why directors choose to change stories for dramatic effect. I wouldn't buy it again, but at the same time, I'm happy I have it because it's a great example of actors and directors trying too hard to create an unauthentic masterpiece.",1435190400,,454,4.416666666666667

There were two earlier versions, one in English and one in Spanish, both directed by Emilio Fernandez, the great Mexican director and actor. They were successful commercially and well reviewed. I hope Amazon can find them and made them available too. I am using the novel in a college level lit course. I'd like to have all three film versions for students too.",1422748800,,481,4.738095238095238
8065176,2,B0009PW4CI,The acting is poor. The ending is disappointing because it doesn't follow the novella at all. Hollywood doesn't like dead babies. My students did enjoy this movie and they were let down with the ending. Lukas Haas did a terrible job playing Kino.,1416528000,,246,4.744186046511628
