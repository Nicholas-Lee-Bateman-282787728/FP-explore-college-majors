8503827,2,B0001AP17G,"this is not steel pulse at its finest. too poppy,to clean.you don't get the street roots sound of this band. and whats up with that crappy 80's snare drum sound? there has to be some hard ass footage of this band somewhere..and they put this out? where is da justice?",1104019200,,267,4.36
8503828,2,B0001AP17G,"I love steel pulse. Their music mastery is terrific, however in this DVD you really don't get the feel of the music. It takes a couple of minutes to recognize the song they are perfoming which takes away all the pleasure of enjoying familiar tunes perfomed live. There is zero bass and if you are a true reggae fan you probably know the need for that German Bass.  No Menus are available either or even just some extra info on Steel Pulse. The picture quality is perfect. All in all the fault is with the sound technicians and not the band.",1084665600,3,540,4.346534653465347
