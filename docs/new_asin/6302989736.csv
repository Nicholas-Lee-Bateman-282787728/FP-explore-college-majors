527489,4,6302989736,"By 1942 Sonja Henie made two more films for Fox....

Darryl F Zanuck(head of Fox) and Sonja hated each others guts and he was so sure he was making his last film with her, when Sun Valley Serenade 1941 became a box-office champion:-)

He had even sold the icerink to Republic, so they had to freeze a smaller dancing area for her last two films.

Thus her space in both Iceland and Wintertime 1942 are relatively smaller than in the other films...

But why didn`t they connect? Well for starters, Sonja was an athlete and had finished her celebrated career in the world of sports... It had made her a tough cookie....

Zanuck had risen from screen writing to become a producer who eventually became head of 20th Century in 1933 -  bought out Fox 1935 - which in turn became a new studio - 20th Century-Fox....

They looked for new talent and stars of their own and Sonja was already a supertar of the ice...

He tried to let her do a featured part..... No no no---- she wouldn`t have it.... why should she? Carry the burden of other stars? She was already a legend in her own time....

Eventually he relented and gave her a leading lady contract, but she was used to getting her way---- and so was he.....

Even so... back to focus....

Even so...

Sonja turned her best skating and best acting performances in Sun Valley, Iceland and especially Wintertime...

In this one her comic timing shines through the whole picture....  she is relaxed and in this she shows an actress at work.

Her skating is also at her best... artistic.... and really showcases her as Queen of The Ice:-)",1335571200,8,1581,4.4982456140350875
527490,5,6302989736,"Entertaining and a joy to watch. Her skating is dated by today standards, but
there is only one Sonja Henie and she's adorable. Too bad they haven't put it
on DVD & colorize it.",1313884800,5,177,4.235294117647059
527491,3,6302989736,"I must admit, I'm not that much of a Sonja Henie fan but I always like the MEN in her movies. She's no kind of actress but she is often surrounded by a fine supporting cast which make her films worthwhile. In this case, it's Cesar Romero as a night club performer who, along with the rest of the cast, is trying to save an old hotel from the wrecking ball. He is absolutely hilarious (even by today's standards). Good big band music by Woody Herman and the always beautiful Carole Landis appears in one of her last films. This (and currently none of her other films) is not available on DVD.",1216252800,6,591,4.285714285714286
7833003,4,6302989736,"Seeing Cesar Romero running around in long handles is hilarious, but the ice skating numbers are great.  Sonja is in top form here and this movie has lots of laughs, (including the slap) and more.  I pull it out when I want a good laugh.",1507766400,,237,4.2444444444444445
7833004,5,6302989736,Such good memories for my mother in law - thank you,1486252800,,51,3.727272727272727
7833005,4,6302989736,Lovely look at an early ice show film. Can't beat Sonja!,1485302400,,56,4.181818181818182
7833006,4,6302989736,"Henie is more grown up here and mixed with a bevy of classic support.  Cesar Romero really gets all the good parts in the film as the fat headed band crooner after Henie, but nice comedy help comes from Carole Landis, Jack Oakie, & S.Z Sakall.  The only out of place role is Cornel Wilde as the romantic lead.  While I like Wilde a lot in other films, he is pretty stiff here.  The real hidden gem in this movie though is the performances by the Woody Herman band.  You also get a nice ballroom dance routine by Henie and Romero.",1423180800,,529,4.198019801980198
7833007,5,6302989736,Sonja was a wonderful ice skater and an Olympic Medalist.  I think she is as good or better than some of the Olympians nowadays.,1399593600,,128,4.333333333333333
7833008,4,6302989736,"I love Sonja Henie movies. This was a good one, not her best, but if you love watching ice skating you'll like this one. If you can find it for a reasonable price it's worth adding to your collection.",1398816000,,200,4.153846153846154
7833009,5,6302989736,"I love these classics and the stars of a the 30's and 40's.  I plan on ordering more classics; as long as I can get them through Amazon, I'm very happy with them.",1394323200,,162,3.909090909090909
7833010,3,6302989736,Nice Sonja Henie musical . Her last film for FOX. But as so often with Fox Cinema Archives DVD R`s a poor print!,1389744000,3,112,3.9130434782608696
7833011,4,6302989736,"This is far better than most of the brainless plots that infested her earlier movies.  Some of the comedy bits are amusing.  Her skating is awesome.  Credit goes largely to Alfred Newman who was head of the 20th Century Fox musical department for putting his brother Emil in charge of scoring the choreography of this film as well as ""Sun Valley Serenade"" and the anemic ""Iceland"".  He made the sappy plots better by simply making the orchestral music routines more interesting.",1388534400,4,478,4.864197530864198
7833012,5,6302989736,This is such a fun little movie - I'm thrilled Fox is finally putting it on DVD! Sonja Henie is the star so of course there's plenty of amazing ice-skating numbers but the real treat here is the supporting cast. Cesar Romero and Carole Landis are hilarious as a bickering couple and their musical duet is one of the highlights. Cornel Wilde and Jack Oakie also give great performances. Although it was made as a b-movie Wintertime is a really good comedy with some fun musical numbers and a wonderful cast!,1385942400,8,506,4.571428571428571
