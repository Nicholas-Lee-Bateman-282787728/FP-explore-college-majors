8469278,5,B005EXA8Z0,"KILLER Kruger escapes from prison and his revenge in one clever plan.

ruthless KILLER KRUGER (Charles McGraw) blasts his way out of the big house (Folsom Prison) along with his two cell mates. He is able to carefully kidnap both the DA and the Detective who sent him to prison. Add his FORMER lady love excellent VIRGINIA GREY whining every step of the way. Kruger moves the GANG and prisoners into a moving truck and passes THROUGH roadblocks. Aided with his 'police radio' he is able to tell every move the police are making. He ends up in a dive shack in the desert waiting for his ""partner' to fly in to make his grand exit. But the DA and the Detective give him clues to ""really set HIM up'....The movie is first rate. McGraw is ruthless and cold and kills with the blink of an eye. Michael O'Shea *THE DETECTIVE* is clever enough to give the cops a clue. and Virginia Grey works overly hard to get Kruger to believe she is not the one who crossed him. The plot is excellent and the acting is even better. 5 STARS all the way. Keeps you glued the entire movie. GREAT ending twist. Also see Armored Car Robbery for more McGraw at his best.",1436054400,4,1144,4.345794392523365
8469279,3,B005EXA8Z0,"'The Threat' (RKO, 1949) is a surprisingly hard-edged programmer in the gangster/police-procedural mold.  Though not quite psychologically or artistically nuanced enough to fit the classic definition of 'noir,' it does serve as a nice example of one of noir's many lesser appendages from the period.  Charles McGraw menaces effectively (much the way Lawrence Tierney did in 1951's similarly jolting 'The Hoodlum') as violent, depraved escaped con Kluger and the story, while nothing special, is propelled along with great efficiency by director Felix Feist ('The Man Who Cheated Himself,' 'The Big Trees').  Warner Archives' DVD-R provides a fairly sharp picture with clear audio, but shows no sign of restoration as age-related artifacts appear throughout.  No extras.  Film rates 3 1/2 stars, presentation/price 3ish.",1396396800,8,819,5.680327868852459
