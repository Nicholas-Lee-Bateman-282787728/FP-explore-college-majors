8015931,1,B0001OGVWG,This particular title probably appeals to people over age 50. I purchased this as a gift for a 92 year old man who enjoys this program. The quality is not what I would call acceptable by today's standards since these videos look like they were copied from VHS tapes. The colors appear washed-out and the contrast enhancement was set too high. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out they ARE NOT CLOSE-CAPTIONED since the recipient is deaf. The bottom panel of the box states that the original Bonanza theme music is not on these DVDs either. My mistake was not asking questions beforehand. This was a bad buying experience and I will never purchase anything else from GoodTimes DVD. Buyer Beware!,1154304000,30,698,4.776859504132231
