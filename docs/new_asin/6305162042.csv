989510,4,6305162042,"Very funny movie, especially the written test scene where Chevy Chase cheats on his exam.
Probably one of Chevy Chase's best movies, may be beaten only by Caddyshack or Vacation.  A movie that I have seen a lot of  times, and probably will see a lot more times.",944956800,,261,4.416666666666667

989628,4,6305162042,"Emmett Fitz-Hume (Dan Aykroyd) and (Chevy Chase) Austin Millbarge are looking for a new life and find it in the CIA. They are so good they are rushed through training. They are dropped off in the desert to perform a mission. Natural adapters they find their skills get them into and out of all situations Hope/Crosby style. Little do they know they are decoys? Speaking of Bob Hope, be sure to notice the key part he plays in this movie.

Will they complete their mission?
Or will they figure out who the decoys are?
Where is the real team?
Is there something more sinister afoot?

989727,1,6305162042,"I love this movie but this version of it is not formatted for the aspect ratio for modern televisions. I guess no one else likes this film because no one has remastered it from from the square tube TVs to post 2005 era technology. Because it's not in 4:3 ratio the images are all stretched and it's hard to watch unless you've got one of those huge old dinosaur TVs.

989731,4,6305162042,"In the 1985 buddy comedy ""Spies Like Us,"" State Department bureaucrats Emmett Fitz-Hume (Chevy Chase) and Austin Millbarge (Dan Aykroyd) are sent, unbeknownst to them, as decoy spies to the Soviet Union.  They not only survive, but stumble into any number of humorous situations along their journey as they come to think that they are to prevent an installation of a Soviet ICBM, only to perform capably when they realize even later what they were really being sent to do.

The film is rated PG and contains adult content, and Gen Xers will likely remember the Paul McCartney song by the same name as the film that was a hit in the winter of 1985-86.  The movie reminds that the Cold War not only provided fodder for drama and adventure, but for comedy as well.  It isn't the most funny or profound comedy ever, but there are enough laughs to provide for an enjoyable 100 minutes or so of down time.",1484697600,,899,4.565217391304348

It's one of the scenes that randomly popped into Family Guy, and you'll never really appreciate it unless you see that original scene.  (which, I guess is no incentive if you don't like Family Guy.

However, I guess it was a week or so later and this movie shows up on Netflix; One more week and I wouldn't have had to buy it. Oh well, at lest when Netflix scrolls it out of their inventory, I'll have it in my Amazon library forever.

But the movie itself is a riot and an amazing work of comedy due to the interaction and classic styles of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. This film is full of classic one-liners that will, to this day, make me laugh out loud just thinking about them.",1470441600,,579,4.123893805309734

It doesn't have the fun of Stripes or the camaradrie of Ghostbusters, but this will get you through an evening without too much if a problem.

Ackroyd plays a basement geek while Chase is a State Dept lackey.  Both are picked to be agents, but unknown to them, they are the dipes to a team with a real assignment.  This is fun but I'm in no hurry to see it again.  It had its moments but, unfortunately, few.",1469232000,,570,4.231481481481482

990699,3,6305162042,"As the title implies, Spies Like Us (1985) is a globe-trotting spy comedy with Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. Theres a host of peripheral stars, like William Prince and the always excellent Bernie Casey, not to mention a cameo by none other than Bob Hope.

This is a fun movie and its great to see Chase and Aykroyd when they were so young, the latter with a quintessential 80s haircut. The best highlights are the awesome globe-spanning locations and the two female co-stars, Donna Dixon and Vanessa Angel, but not enough is done with em. The films just not funny enough and its hard to believe the producers went to such great expense, but failed to hire writers who knew how to do comedy. Were left with a fun, but throwaway flick; even Hopes cameo is a waste of celluloid.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in Norway, Morocco, California and England.

still a classic comedy to this Day, i still find every scene extremely Hilarious

Warner bros did a disgusting effort releasing this film on DVD
first of all the film is in 1:33:1 Full screen when it should've been transferred into 1:85:1 widescreen
the picture quality is terrible it looks like a direct VHS transfer but slightly cleaned up a little
to make it look bit more clearer than VHS quality,
still lots of Grain & Dirt in the film thou
of course no new special features nothing actually except for Theatrical trailer
it would've been Great if warner bros made some effort to produce a new retrospective featurette
with Director John Landis, Dan Akroyd, Chevy chase, Donna Dixon
but of course WB did not bother

Spies like us finally did get a blu-ray release by WB but as Double feature with Funny farm
but guess what this new blu-ray has the exact same treatment as the DVD release
tragically no new special features on this new blu-ray version
and the picture quality is similar to the dvd release aswell
very tragic, warner bros obviously does not give a Damn about classic comedies from the 80'S
this new packaging as seen on this amazon website
is just another reissue by warner bros, nothing has been changed with the picture quality or the extras
the only thing that's Different is the packaging, it's clamshell keepcase package
the old dvd version was snapcase
again Disgusting insulting effort by warner bros
spies like us Deserves more respect for sure, hopefully warner bros will wake up and realize
they need to give this film better blu-ray release with new special features

991107,5,6305162042,"First things first: the DVD rendition of this film was not as good as one would have hoped.  Nonetheless, it's a great comedy from one of the great comedy directors of all-time, John Landis.
The plot has a CIA/NSA type of agency needing some foils or dupes who can try and penetrate Soviet territory to locate some mobile ballistic missiles.  They get the two biggest screwups, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase.  They work so smoothly together that you'd think it was a comedy team from years back.  Their interplay with the 'locals' and the foreign charity medical workers was wonderful; even better was their treatment of and by the Soviet interrogators and the ground control(missile) team.
This film is so parallel to 'Real Genius' that one wonders if there was some copying of papers here.  It doesn't lessen the quality of either film, though.  Older viewers will notice similarities to the old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road films.  To cement that fact, the producers actually had Bob Hope do a cameo appearance in the film spoofing that...
Though some aspects of this film are far-fetched, and rather dated with the end of the Cold War, the comedy is still real and non-pareil.
This is often forgotten when the litany of great comedies is mentioned, but it's up there with the best and the funniest action/adventure films ever.",1418860800,,1325,4.836283185840708

But this didn't prevent him from continuing to occasionally work with other cast members.

Thus in 1985, SPIES LIKE US, with ex-SNL partner Dan Aykroyd. It's a nuclear age comedy written by Dan and Dave Thomas that was scripted by him, plus Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, a team famous for their sitcom episodes.

Even though it was directed by John Landis, this one's only marginally amusing.

992112,4,6305162042,"I recently mentioned something about this movie to my wife and discovered she'd never actually seen it.  The horror!  Easy fix: Amazon had the DVD available for a reasonable price, and without having to dig through the DVD bargain bins at local stores.

While the undertone of the movie is fairly serious--once again, power-crazy people trying to convince the world how powerful they are, this time during the Cold War--there's plenty of comedic action between Aykroyd and Chase.  It's not perfect, and some parts are a bit slow, but I enjoyed it just as much as I did nearly 30 years ago (eek).  The two of them have some real buddy chemistry in the film, and make some of the more ridiculous situations enjoyable thanks to crazy lines from Chase or encyclopedic data analysis of events or situations from Aykroyd in that unique tone and delivery of his.

If you're a fan of the SNL-era Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase from the late 70's to the mid-80's I definitely recommend this for more than a few laughs and even some surprise cameos.  Just be prepared for some overly-loud, overly-dramatic music in places.",1364601600,,1109,4.744791666666667

Later, in college, I realized how wonderfully executed this film was, what it was satirizing and how very real it could be.

Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase are selected as decoys in the government's scheme, using legit soldiers, to launch a Russian nuke into space, in hopes the US will be able to neutralize the threat from space.  If this sounds familiar, it's a take on Reagan's Star Wars initiative of having satellites in space to take out any nuclear rockets coming our way.

At it's heart, it's a comedy, a dark comedy along the lines of Dr. Strangelove, but not nearly as brilliant.  Chevy Chase is at his best, with his off-the-cuff humor and goofy faces.

992608,3,6305162042,"""Spies Like Us"" should be a nostalgic time warp back to 1985 when SNL veteran comedians Chevy Chase and Dan Aykoyd were still at the top of their big screen game.  Director John Landis already had the raunchy frat-boy classic ""Animal House"" and the higher-brow Dan & Eddie Murphy flick, ""Trading Places,"" among his credits demonstrating why he was perhaps the best comedy filmmaker of the early 1980's.  Unfortunately, their team-up for ""Spies Like Us"" inexplicably blows a can't miss premise (a SNL spy spoof) with a series of misfired gags that just don't improve with time.  All that holds up this movie is Chevy and Dan's buddy chemistry.

Much like ""Trading Places,"" this movie takes its time revving up, but the hilarious premise is made clear early on.  Playing Cold War games, an American spy agency (fronted by veteran actors William Prince, Steve Forrest, and Bruce Davison) schemes to send two pairs of secret agents on a mission infiltrating Russia: one team to do the hush-hush job and the other offered up as highly expendable decoys.  Guess which ones Chevy and Dan are?  Recruited after obnoxiously failing their Foreign Service Board exams (complete with hidden camera footage), State Dept. bureaucrat Emmitt Fitzhume (Chevy) and Pentagon techno-geek Austin Milbarge (Dan) become fast friends while being rushed through training and then literally dropped into Pakistan where the KGB is eagerly awaiting them.  This stretch (particularly, the training sequence) is probably the movie's best, as it mostly works on all thrusters.

Yet, once the guys hit Pakistan and then Russia, the gags simply start falling flat one after another.  Case in point: the ""Doctor, Doctor"" introduction wasn't funny the first time and then the script inexplicably repeats it just moments later.  The scene's only redeeming element is a fast cameo from Bob Hope reminding viewers that Hope and Bing Crosby's ""Road"" movie series probably still age better than this movie ever will.  It is not that the cast (including Dan's real-life spouse, Donna Dixon) isn't trying hard, but the script just isn't pitching them much of anything really funny to do.  Still, my favorite gag involves Chevy and Dan's pay phone sequence somewhere in Pakistan's desert bush calling collect to their incredulous bosses' ultra-secret underground bunker.  Beyond that, there isn't much else that ""Spies Like Us"" does that is laugh-out-loud hilarious -- although the finale involving Chevy & Dan teaming up with their new Russian friends in trying to prevent World War III is worth waiting to see.

The bottom line is that the movie, despite so few truly funny scenes, remains somehow very watchable, especially if you are a Dan & Chevy fan.  It also confirms a couple of things: 1. Chevy's wisecracking persona gets old fast without a top-notch script; and 2. Dan is best playing the straight man on a tag team (with Chevy, John Belushi, Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, etc.) than he is without a sidekick.  Specifically, his bland Austin Milbarge hardly lights up the movie screen in solo scenes, but, at least with Chevy, he becomes sorta like Barney Rubble yukking it up with Fred Flintstone.  All in all, ""Spies Like Us"" is certainly worth watching once before it becomes a pretty good choice for background noise.  And, lastly, Paul McCartney's rocking title song in the end credits remains a hoot to listen to after almost thirty years.

Score: 6.5/10 (there are better Cold War movie spoofs out there, but kids age 12 and up will probably like this one best.)",1267488000,,3531,5.013698630136986
992609,4,6305162042,"I first saw Spies Like Us when I was a kid, when Chevy Chase was my favourite actor. I must have seen it about fifty times since then and I am almost word-perfect on the script. However, I've never owned the DVD since Warner have never released it in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Thankfully it is currently available in HD on the PlayStation network.

Emmett Fitz-Hume and Austin Millbarge (Chase and Aykroyd) are two lowly government workers who are suddenly promoted to the elite GLG-20 spy status after they are caught cheating on a test. What they don't know is that they are just decoys to draw heat away from the real spies and are promptly dumped straight into enemy territory.

Chase and Aykroyd have great chemistry together and I'm surprised they didn't work together much after this (although they did hook up for The Couch Trip, Caddyshack 2 and Nothing But Trouble). There's loads of fun to had in watching them bumble from one zany situation from the next. And, as this is a Landis film, there are director cameos all over the place. Keep a lookout for Terry Gilliam, Martin Brest, Joel Coen, Sam Raimi etc.

Despite the fanbase, Warner have never showed this film any respect or given special treatment of any kind when it comes to the home video market. As I already said, as of yet the only DVD available is the fullscreen version from 1998. Even the HD version I watched was from a very murky print and has terrible sound.

""Spies"" picks up where Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" left off, and throws in a couple of sexy ladies for good measure.  It takes an appropriate jab at (then) President Reagan by showing one of his cheesy musicals.

One of my favorite parts is when Aykroyd and Chase get dropped into  Pakistan in a huge container filled with chips and beer (their ""spy"" supplies).  Another is when the Soviet/American negotiations are really a game of Risk/Trivial Pursuit!

992782,4,6305162042,"That's what the title song by Paul McCartney declares at the end of the credits.  And despite the space satellites in the opening scene, the sign on one of them reading, ""American Weather Station.  Of No Military Value"" hints at the comedic nature ahead.  Spies Like Us is typical 80's comedy, entertaining, leaning mostly on lines by Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd's deadpan reaction.  An 80's version of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's Road pictures, as has been said of it, is indeed accurate.
After Emmett Fitzhugh (Chevy Chase), a member of the diplomatic press corps cheats at a foreign service exam, unwittingly drawing in Austin Millbarge (Dan Aykroyd), a codebreaker and technical expert, they are recruited as GLG agents for a secret mission which leads them to Pakistan and eventually into Tadzhikistan, then part of the Soviet Union.  What they don't know is that they are the decoys while some other GLG agents are the ones actually carrying out the operation.  While the training sequences seem to be run-of-the-mill stuff, it's mostly the lines that get the laughs.
However, the part where they are mistaken for doctors in Pakistan is one of the funnier scenes, particularly Fitzhugh's attempt to get the pretty blonde Dr. Boyer (Donna Dixon) to himself without marchlow present.
As in Ghostbusters Dan Aykroyd plays the straight and smarter man, and is fortunate to be paired with one of the best funny men of the 80's, Chevy Chase.  And okay, so Chase gets paired with the blonde in the movie, but did you see the girl Aykroyd ends up with?  A big ROWR to Vanessa Angel!  Chevy Chase has the great funny lines and a lot of the gags revolve around him.  When a grenade is tossed at he and Aykroyd, he catches it and asks his partner, ""What's this?""  Aykroyd panics and says, ""You don't want it!""  Aykroyd later hears the Bar-Kays' song ""Soul Finger"" coming from the forest.  After identifying the song, Chase says, ""They really must be desperate for gigs.""
Roots of this comedy include SDI, the arms race, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and a general from the Jack D. Ripper academy of crazed warmongers, General Slime, played by Steve Forrest, who in one line says that naively wishing for peace leads to aggressive war.  Maybe he should have heard Millbarge's quote on nuclear weapons: ""Do you know what those things can do? Suck the paint off your house and give your family a permanent orange afro.""
And speaking of guest stars and cameos, I list Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, 1950's special effects designer Ray Harryhausen, 7,14,21,28, and 35UP director Michael Apted, political thriller director Costa Gavras as a Tadzhiki guard, and Bob Hope, who has a funny line at Fitzhugh and Millbarge's expense.
Director John Landis's stamp is on here, e.g. Animal House, Trading Places, and after this movie, The Three Amigos and Coming To America.  While I like this movie, I kind wonder how Harold Ramis would have directed this.  And this movie makes me want to check out the Bar-Kays and ""Soul Finger"".",1061683200,3,3007,4.832358674463937

Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase's comedic talents are clearly wasted by a [bad] script and paper-thin characters.
The gist of the movie is that Alyroyd plays the straight man to Chase's character.  Both are low-grade intellegence agents sent as decoys on a mission to launch a missile from the USSR in order to test out the US ""Star Wars"" defense system.
In a thinly-disguised swipe at the ""Star Wars"" concept, the system misses the missile and nuclear war is about to ensue...
The ending is both predictable and dumb.
There are some funny moments, but when the highlight of the film is Bob Hope dressed like the late great Payne Stewart, you know there aren't many.",1035244800,4,753,4.837209302325581

992865,5,6305162042,First of all it contains two of the funniest comedians of the eighties Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd that alone is a good reason for seeing this movie. Then they play their parts tremendously good so you can be sure to have some really good laughs watching this movie. You will not be dissapointed. I gave it a 5.,1018828800,,311,4.288135593220339
992866,2,6305162042,"Well it would seem that Warner Bothers have failed again to utilize the DVD format to it's fullest! The picture transfer is poor - in some places it's obvious that they haven't even taken the time to clean up the original print. Don't be fooled - 1985 wasn't that long ago! So this movie shouldn't look like a VHS rental copy on DVD! The sound is very much below par and there are no extras; no director's/actor's commentary, no cinema preview, no music clip by Paul McCartney etc (He did the song for the movie!). Overall, if you want a laugh and you see this version of the movie for a cheap(!) price - buy it. However, if like me you love this movie, I would recommend that you wait and hang on to your VHS copy in the hope that we get a 'Collectors Edition'. Maybe we will get lucky and someone from Warner Brothers will actually read these reviews!",1017100800,14,853,4.304347826086956

992868,4,6305162042,"This movie is great.  Its an american comedy classic.  The special effects arnt great, the plot isn't that of a Hitchcock movie, and its full of corney humor that only Chevy and Aykroyd can produce in a way that makes it funny.  Great to watch again and again.  The only reason why I give this 4 stars instead of five is that I feel Warner Brothers did the movie an unjustice by rushing with the DVD.  They did not bother to put any menues, or special features onto the dvd.  Its just the movie and thats it.  Its not even in wide-screen.  Also, the picture and sound quality arnt that great either.  Too bad they could have done ALOT more with it.  Dispite all of that though, its still great to own just for the movie alone.  My advice; buy it.",1012003200,,746,4.219858156028369
992869,5,6305162042,I Love This movie. I have seen it countless times. It is a great comedy. Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase in their first collaberation are a really good team. This is what brought them into Caddyshack 2.,1010188800,,198,4.378378378378378
992870,4,6305162042,I just finished watching this show for the first time and I have to say that it is one of Chevy Chase's best!  It's hilarious and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who is a fan of his.,1009670400,,189,3.973684210526316
992936,4,6305162042,"When I was in junior high, my friends and I would ride the bus to the Go-Skate skateboard shop, harass the workers into giving us free stickers, and then go to Thrifty's with our loose change for some $0.35 ice cream. We'd top off the afternoon with a second-run movie at the Almaden Twin.
Spies Like Us was one of those movies. And with Chevy Chase's fart scene (maybe the best ever on film), damn, a kid that age would bust the biggest gut laughing! The entire foreign service exam scene, the training camp, the doctor doctors, the missles...dude, this movie has it all.
Go-skate has moved, ice cream is about a dollar now, and they carved up the Twin into 6 living rooms that hardly qualify as theaters, but Spies Like Us is still HELLA funny!",1007683200,4,746,4.452554744525547
992937,3,6305162042,"Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd have made their share of trash, but this Cold War spoof isn't half-bad.  When supported by a solid script, or at least a promising set-up, Chase can be hysterical.  And this movies gives him a lot of material to work with.  The classroom scene might be the single funniest moment in Chevy's career.  With the exception of Caddyshack, his timing has never been this pitch-perfect.  Aykroyd, as usual, plays the slightly quirky straight man.  Nothing wrong with that, since his better film work usually consists of fulfilling this role (Ghostbusters, Trading Places).  Spies Like Us won't blow you mind, but it does have moments of inspiration.",1004313600,,670,4.981981981981982
992938,3,6305162042,"OK, its not great film.  But if you are fans of Akroyd or Chase, or just like to gaffaw at silly movies, this one is a special treat.  It helps knowing the people involved.  For example, did you know that Donna Dixon who plays the seductive doctor/CIA agent is really Dan's wife!  What about the fact that is was taking place in Pakistan, and drops geography names that are on the news now with the pending trouble in Afghanistan?  I love the test cheating part, the UFO part, and the shootout at the outpost.  Cheap laughs, but belly laughs.  One of my arsenal of ""make me feel good"" movies.",1001462400,,592,4.376146788990826
992939,4,6305162042,"Spies Like Us is a very funny although silly movie. Chevy Chase is in rare form, probably my favorite from him with the exceptions of the original Vacation and Caddyshack. I picked this one up... and didn't really expect a whole lot of extras from it. Good thing because there are no extras on this DVD! While it may not be of the highest quality from the DVD standpoint, it is a very good movie and I'm happy with my purchase.",979689600,,427,4.283950617283951
992940,5,6305162042,"I LOVE this film!!!  It's not smart ... it's not mysterious ... it's Akroyd and Chase doing slapstick reminiscent of the Bing and Crosby ""On the Road"" movies.  If you're a ""Fletch"" fan, you'll enjoy Chevy Chase as his usual wisecracking self.
Produced during the Reagan '80's when ""Star Wars"" defensive and offensive systems were being explored, the boys head into Russia and unwittingly launch an ICBM against the United States.  Stars Akroyd's real life wife, ""Bosom Buddies""'s Donna Dixon.  Look for Matt Frewer of ""Max Headroom"" and Jim Staahl of ""Laugh Trax"".
The test-taking scene with Frank Oz (""Blues Brothers"") is nothing short of hilarious (as is the videotaped scenes afterward).  Some of the special effects are so-so but most of the cinematography is great and the animation and minatures are excellently done for the most part.  And the beautiful Vanessa Angel shows up as a Russian soldier (wow).
Sure it's silly but it's a great popcorn movie and has enough site gags to keep most of the family amused.  The scene with Akroyd and Chase performing surgery while reading from a manual is a real crack-up.  Lotsa fun!",974678400,24,1130,4.910526315789474
992941,4,6305162042,"I just picked up the DVD of this flick as I had seen it years ago in the  theatre and remember it being funny.  Well, it still is.  I laughed out  loud the whole movie.  This is Chevy Chase in his prime!!  Reminds me of  his perfection in the first Vacation movie.  As for DVD quality, I was  quite pleased with the picture after reading alot of negative reviews on  the quality.  It was everything I expected from a 1985 movie of this  caliber. Clear and bright colors with an occasional artifact from a lousy  transfer print.  The audio was a different story.  It is just 2 channel  which is ok on a $9.99 disc, but there was an annoying hissing sound  through most of the movie.  After fifteen minutes I started playing with  the options on my stereo and got rid of it on the 'Cinema C' setting.  Yes,  it is pan-n- scan and the scene selection menu is nothing but the Warner  Bros Logo(can't beleive they couldn't even load the picture that was on the  case!?!?)and there is not even a trailer, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it  again.  The colors are brighter than the VHS and if you have a decent sound  system, you can dispell the hissing sound(or just pretend you're watching  it in the forest with the wind blowing thru the pine trees!!) Still a VERY  funny movie.  I would say the scene with Chevy taking the 'Spy Exam' alone  is worth the price of this disc!!  Get it already!!!!!",968025600,3,1392,4.3203125
