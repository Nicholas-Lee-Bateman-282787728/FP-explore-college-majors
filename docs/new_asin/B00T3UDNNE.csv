6999869,3,B00T3UDNNE,This series starts off kind of slow but gets better in the last episode.,1434844800,,72,4.214285714285714
6999870,5,B00T3UDNNE,I watched this last season and it was one of my very favorite programs. When it was released I was happy watching it all again. The bad guy is really a bad guy.,1434585600,,160,3.878787878787879
6999871,5,B00T3UDNNE,Murder In The First is an awesome crime drama. This show was done by Steven Bochco and it also had a great stellar cast. Bochco also created terrific crime dramas like NYPD Blue and Hill Street Blues. Taye Diggs and James Cromwell were my two favorite actors in this series.,1434585600,,274,4.5

6999874,5,B00T3UDNNE,Watching the second season now!! You will end up wanting to watch every episode!!!,1433980800,,82,4.928571428571429
6999875,2,B00T3UDNNE,"I had high expectations for a police drama from the creator of Hill Street Blues but, with each episode it got harder and harder to watch. Poor Kathleen Robertson. If her character isn't kissing a murder suspect to get a DNA sample she is mooning over her partner while he sings karaoke. Not to mention having the two main characters kiss. Really? How about a grown up relationship in which they are partners and friends and nothing else. Then you have the concept of the series. Following one case for the entire season. I was hoping for more ambiguity. How about a DA with political motives for prosecution and not both detectives being on board with it. Also a more complex prime suspect would have really been nice. He just seemed to be a spoiled arrogant ass. Hope they improve the writing for season 2.",1433116800,2,808,4.5793103448275865
6999876,5,B00T3UDNNE,Excellent New series!!!! Must Seee,1432425600,,34,6.0
6999877,3,B00T3UDNNE,"Murder in the First is a perplexing show given it's pedigree.  The bar is set quite high when you see this is a Steven Bochco creation; ""Hill St. Blues"", ""NYPD Blues"", ""Cop Rock""...(OK, so ""Cop Rock"" was an aberration), Bochco really established the gritty, realistic police drama genre.  Perhaps the limited ten episode format pressured the writers to try and pack too much story in a timeline that was too tight; things happen and are resolved ridiculously quickly and easily.  Plot points are introduced and then either dismissed or speedily remedied.

Our protagonists are SFPD Police Inspectors Hildy Mulligan (Kathleen Robertson) and Terry English (Taye Diggs) who are partners in the homicide division.  They catch a case of a murdered drug dealer that bleeds over into another murder involving the employee of a young tech billionaire.  There's an eventual trial and a delightful turn by James Cromwell as a high powered defense attorney.  Once the story gets going it's not terrible but as others have noted there are some things that are hard to buy.  Kathleen Robertson is a beautiful woman, but looks like she should be on a fashion shoot and not mixing it up with bad guys- she weighs about 90#.  She kisses a suspect while chewing gum to get his DNA, this would seem a questionable practice on a number of levels and she's even called out on it in court with no consequence.  She's later involved in an officer involved shooting, appears to be reconnecting with her ex-husband, and even has a romantic moment with her partner but these elements lead nowhere and are quickly dispensed with.  The two witnesses to their first case are kids, one young boy has the street name of ""D-hop"" but he looks about as street as Jerry Mathers did in ""Leave it to Beaver"".  The married DA and homicide LT are having an unprofessional relationship which isn't interesting but is a distraction. Inspector English is suffering after his wife's death by cancer in episode one and prone to beating up suspects in the interview room, or pummeling two lugs in a bar when they provoke him- rather than just badging them and calling uniforms to arrest them all without repercussions.

Given the lack of quality programming offered today this show is still worth viewing despite its flaws, hoping season two is better.",1472256000,7,2308,4.857142857142857
