8762814,5,B01GFB4U44,"This dual pack comes with Batman Year One and Batman Gotham Knight. Originally was going to buy just Batman: Year One standalone but saw that Gotham Knight combo for a couple dollars more and decided to buy that instead. Being disappointed in DC New 52 inspired animated universe which has been pretty mediocre. I decided to buy some older animated movies when the films were better.

Batman Year One is the best movie in this double feature. Its based off of Frank Miller graphic novel released in the 80s. Its considered Frank Millers best work who also did Dark Knight Returns, Daredevil, and Sin City. Batman Year One is different from the other origin stories of Batman as it also follows James Gordons Year One in Gotham. Gordon is played by Bryan Cranston and he steals the show and is the best thing in year one. Batmans voice is largely criticized for being monotone. I liked Batmans voice in this depiction its not that bad as people say it is. Its definitely not the best but its better than the Irish guy who is doing Batman now who tries hard to conceal his Irish accent. Batman Year One is a hidden gem that gets overlooked because it's an origins story and everyone knows Batmans origins. Batman Year One is one of DCs best works. With great animation and a great story Batman Year One is stays true to the comic and shows how they should of done the Killing Joke.
5/5

Batman Gotham Knight is an Anime directed series of 6 episodes all done in a different style and thats the movies downfall. The different animations styles made the story hard to follow. It was half way through the movie where Bruce looked like Light Yagami. I realized that it was one branching story. Which leaves me to the pacing which is terrible it was all over the place. The overall plot is Batman is solving a gang war between the Russians and Italians but it has a bunch of subplots that take up episodes.
Its all a shame as it all looks amazing aside from the first episode that was ugly and terrible. If they picked a style and have focused plot this could of been amazing. The best episode by far was working through pain where Bruce goes to India to learn from an Indian Woman how to tolerate pain and it showed the psychology of Batman and his inner pain is greater than any physical. It was amazing, it's a shame that the rest of this movie isnt. There is potential in Gotham Knight but it's all lost with all these different styles and pacing. At least it looks pretty
3/5

Conclusion I would get this pack for Year One alone and definitely recommend it. Consider Gotham Knight a bonus. Hopefully DC can get there animate movies back on track with Batman and Harley Quinn returning to the DC animated universe.",1498867200,2,2711,4.483805668016195
