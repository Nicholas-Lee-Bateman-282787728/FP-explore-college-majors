3796707,1,B001U418W4,"I love this series but it was sooo shortened out. Good quality though. But seriously don't buy it thinking its the whole series because it isnt, its just a summary. It almost doesnt make sense when you watch it for the first time,",1356048000,4,230,4.372093023255814
3796708,1,B001U418W4,"Soo much is cut out from this novela, there is no point of even buying it because the novela doesn't make any sense! I was very disappointed because I really enjoyed the novela on tv.",1326153600,,183,4.257142857142857
3796709,4,B001U418W4,"This is a shortened version of a fun, Spanish telenovela, which follows the myriad love triangles of a group of fairly wealthy Venezuelan teenagers at a school for the arts.  You have bullies, mean girls, jocks, musicians, comedians, nice kids, all the stereotypes.  It's really good for practicing Spanish, because they repeat the same things over and over again.  The Venezuelan accent was a little hard for me to understand at first, but I quickly got used to it.  Yes, the story is silly, but it's very entertaining, and the musical numbers are well done.  The cast is very attractive, they wear nice outfits, and the whole thing is very sweet.  The funniest part is that the adults are portrayed as much dumber than the kids.",1284681600,5,730,4.753968253968254
8342878,4,B001U418W4,"I love this telenovela. It's heartwarming, fun, and family-friendly. Plus the songs are awesome! My main complaint is that the DVD doesn't have all the episodes, editing the almost 170 episodes down into 13. A heck ton of story is cut out that way, and some of my favorite songs too. Some of the story threads they kept don't make any sense without the buildup, so you'll probably be really confused as to what the heck they're talking about, especially with Hendrick and the ""admirador secreto"" storyline. Fortunately, I've seen the whole telenovela before, so this is a nice jaunt down memory lane that I can supplement with youtube videos for the scenes and songs I really miss.
The discs work and the case is in good shape. Came like new.
Does not have English subtitles.",1521158400,,775,4.705882352941177

8342880,3,B001U418W4,I wanted to use this for my Spanish 3 class and it is cute but I think a little too young for my kids so we ended up watching El Internado and they love that.  This is a cute series for middle schoolers.,1444003200,,203,3.7209302325581395
