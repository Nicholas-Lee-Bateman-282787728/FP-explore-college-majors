and his kind and gentle, common sense father who tries to come to the rescue.  Surprise and shocking ending.
Great wilderness mountain nature scenery.  Vern is shy and unsure but confident in the wilderness.",1486598400,,318,4.642857142857143

7844459,5,630332603X,"This was an instant classic. My friends and I used to watch this movie late at night on USA's-Up All Night. Whenever it was on, we would call each other to watch it.
The tale of a female jogger who gets kidnapped by a dirty, scruffy mountain man. The crazy mountain man drags her to his cabin by tying a rope around her neck. When they arrive, his 'cabin' is nothing more than a 1-room shack. A classic line in the movie is, ""WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME."" HAHAHAHAHAHA...
We used to laugh at that line.
Then the crazed mountain man tries to sexually assault the poor girl, but he gets so excited that he's 'done' before he even gets his pants off. HAHAHAHA....
Dan Haggerty is cast as the psycho's father who rescues the girl, but alas there's a twist at the end.
RECOMMENDED!!! RENT, BUY, OR STEAL THIS MOVIE. ""Thumbs Up""",1280188800,,819,4.359477124183006

I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.",1229904000,,274,4.169811320754717
7844461,4,630332603X,"I saw this movie on tv one day.  It was kind of weird, but I was feeling open-minded and decided to watch it all the way through. I'm glad I watched the whole thing, I ended up liking it.  It was about a woman who was jogging one day and gets kidnapped by a crazy man that lives in the mountains.  He attempts to assault her and keeps her attached to him on a rope at all times.  It's somewhat of a thriller/drama not really a horror, it wasn't scary.  It was very realistic, and I don't know anyone who has ever heard of this movie.  One of those movies that no one takes the time to watch, but should because it is really entertaining.",1052092800,8,637,4.056
