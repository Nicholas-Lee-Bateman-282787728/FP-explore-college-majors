7860228,5,6304069502,"For those who are looking for tornado footage there is no disappointment here. The focus is on the weather, not so much on the chasers as what one may find in other storm videos, these three volumes are the best for a more historical aspect of tornadoes, showcasing scientific development up to present times in clear terms and analysis of the storms themselves. While I truly admire the chasers for doing what they do, I would like to see what they are doing scientifically, not focusing so much of the internal fighting and squabbling that seems to be gong on in so many of the newer videos. These are definitely worth the price and I highly recommend them.",1292544000,,659,4.593220338983051
7860229,4,6304069502,"This video has a ton of footage (it's two hours), all of which is pretty dramatic as well as spectacular. The only things I didn't like about it, though, were that in many cases they only showed the footage of, for example, a guy and his family watching a tornado coming closer and closer to their home, then at the last minute the one with the camera runs to shelter and ... that's it. You don't get to see what happens, i.e. what everything looked like afterwards. It just jumps to the next clip. And, I thought the corny music used durning parts of the film really detracted from an otherwise great collection of footage.",994809600,3,624,4.434782608695652
