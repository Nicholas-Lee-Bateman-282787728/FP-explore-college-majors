The DVD starts out great with Kaeshi, Amar Gamal, Azziza, and Tamr Henna and then it is down hill from there. There is some motion-sickness-inducing camera work on ""Moon Over Ala Nar"", but most of this DVD is well produced. There is a lot of great songs on here too. Overall, it's definitely worth watching, just be choosy who you copy your dance moves from!",1395360000,,429,4.375
8186171,4,B000OPVSHK,"I have to agree with another reviewer when they said Amar Gamal is the highlight of this show. Not to say the other dancers were shabby, (definitley not the case) but her number was so high energy and infectious you can see she's a born dancer. I've been a fan since first sighting Amar on Bellydance Superstars but this video also gave me my first glimpse of Ava Fleming who was terrific in her number and am eager to see more of. Like alot of famous tribal dancers she has awesome isolations and technique. Looking forward to her workshop in Springfield MO this summer! The other standout numbers were Louchia shimmying away to a dramtic violin song and Nallini who did a very floaty feminine veil number. There's also alot of informational text about the history of oriental dance and its variant styles. Overall I liked majority of the dancers and the fact it includes classical as well as modern and fusion performances. Recommended for egyptian style lovers.",1330473600,,964,4.744047619047619
8186172,4,B000OPVSHK,"This is NOT an instructional DVD!  It is, however, a nice (very basic) intro to the subject, with different dancers doing different types of belly dancing.  I didn't realize that there were different types of belly dancing, only having seen it a little on TV or in the movies, and live a couple of times in Moroccan restaurants, so I now know that there are many styles/types.

I presume the dancers are supposed to do their specialty or a type in which they are expert, and I am no aficionado of belly dancing, but even I could tell that some of the dancers were better than others.

If you are looking to see some different styles of belly dancing, I would recommend this DVD as a starting point. You could then find out more about the particular style(s) that interested you.  If you are looking for a history or detailed information, this is not the DVD you are looking for.",1291766400,2,878,4.4625
8186173,2,B000OPVSHK,"My primary motivation in buying this video was to watch Amar Gamal and Kaeshi.  They did not disappoint.  They are 2 of the most watchable belly dancers for me and their performances were original, highly enjoyable and beautiful.  The choreographies they each performed were inventive, especially in the case of Kaeshi. I loved the twist she put in the veil dance, giving it a bondage spin without deviating from tastefulness. One other dancer I also enjoy is Aziza, as she always has a very high energy level that never seems to flag despite what she is doing onstage.  I have been dancing for only 2 years and I find it hard to keep my smile on all the time. She really relays her enjoyment of what she is doing so well that I find myself inspired whenever I watch her. Sadly I cannot recall the name of the dancer who performed with the cane because I also liked her performance.

Those were the only performances I found myself entranced by.  The rest seemed repetitive and unoriginal. The one I liked least was the performance of the Shimmy Sisters.  Technically they may know how to do the moves but they seemed to lack fluidity and grace, and their choreography was neither original nor enjoyable.",1190851200,7,1204,4.624413145539906
