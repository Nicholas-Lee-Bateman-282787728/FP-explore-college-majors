[UPDATE: The picture and sound quality of this DVD release is superb, but for some reason Episode #20--""Sex, Lies and UFO's, Part 2"" has the End Credits of Episode #18--""Double Jeopardy""!]",1321315200,19,1642,5.6571428571428575
8493826,3,B00668IFCU,"The series was filmed and edited on video. It ran with a washed out, slightly fuzzy look. Most of the programs looked like that. The DVDs look the same way. No sharp HD image here.
It has a very 80s vibe to it (styles of clothes and music). It was made in 90'. All of the young people look 80s dated! I wonder if today's kids will not want to watch it due to that.
 After 8 programs the original idea was scrapped: two aliens on earth who were suppoed to attened college but instead one looked for adventure and food, the other girls. Then the parents and school idea were gone. These guys are mostly after fun and sex. No much to go on. They both act goofy, no straight man here. No balance. No voice of reason. The crazy banter wears on the viewer. Also the one beat idea.
Hey, after 20 (or was it 21 shows?It there a missing show from this set?), these aliens vanished.
I wantched it once in a while back in 90. It was a bit funny and crazy. Watching it now, that is a sort of marathon, it wears on you much faster.

Each show is 60 mins. Some shows are low budget, other not as much so.
The stars were clearly having the time of their short lives shooting this. They are enjoying themselves. It does make it enjoyable. Plus they are fast paced.
Hey, a lot of the actors show up in other episodes as other characters.
If you were a fan you should watch it again. My guess is that you'll watch a few shows, let the DVDs sit on the shelf, and then, one day,  sell the set in a yard sale .",1504137600,,1489,4.040677966101695
8493827,5,B00668IFCU,"A blast from the past, great series in its time, and moreso in retrospect.  Fun silly humor, just shift your brain into neutral and enjoy!

Always always always some great scenery in each episode, too!

All 20 episodes, 4 discs of 5-per, no frills, 4:3 aspect ratio, but solid.

Only oddity I noticed (probably also in the masters, not a fault of the discs) was that the end-credits for ep 20 were wrong (a duplicate of ep 17 or 18).  If anyone cares...  :)

For 20bux, you can't possibly go wrong!

No crazy DRM, either, so they ripped easily, and I can watch them anytime on my tablet, media center, anywhere.  Keep the original discs nice and safe.",1462492800,,651,4.4491525423728815

8493830,4,B00668IFCU,"""They Came From Outer Space"" was a short-lived (20 episodes) syndicated show that aired during the 1990-91 season. It starred Dean Cameron and Stuart Fratkin (who also appeared in the movie ""Ski School"" together) as two alien brothers from the planet Crouton, where interplanetary travel has been achieved, but otherwise the planet seems to be culturally and socioeconomically similar to the United States. The duo's father sends them to Cambridge University to get an education (in spite of the level of technological advancement on Crouton, apparently they don't have universities, I suppose). Bo decides that California sounds like more fun, so they change course and (crash-)land there. Stranded in a junkyard, they put together a 1959 Corvette from parts in the yard, and concoct a plan to convince their father that they're getting a Cambridge education while tooling around southern California (and sometimes other locations) in their Corvette, mostly in pursuit of girls, but also eating copious amounts of food (Croutonians have enormous appetites, you see).

Of course, it wouldn't be much fun if the boys didn't have an adversary, so we have Allan Royal and Christopher Carroll as Lt. Col. Tom Barker and Lt. Pat Wilson respectively. Barker was an Air Force colonel who was demoted because of a screw-up, and thinks that by capturing Bo and Abe is his ticket out of career purgatory. In spite of numerous attempts to capture the duo, he always fails, partially due to his own stupidity, but also because the boys have alien powers that would thwart any mere mortal: object transference (the ability to swap inanimate objects), the ability to communicate with animals, and the ability to transpose themselves into objects. They also have a Corsican Brothers-type of thing going where each brother can feel each other's pains (and pleasures), leading to much hilarity.

""They Came From Outer Space"" only lasted one season (one episode even contains an opening segment in which the boys express dismay at having found their show in the bargain bin at the video store), although it seems to have retained a following, even after almost 25 years. I recall watching most of these episodes on the a local station, WWOR (channel 9) on Saturday afternoons. Watching these episodes years later, it's not difficult to see their appeal. Although somewhat formulaic, the writers made an effort to make the show interesting by putting the boys in different situations: they judge a beauty contest in a small midwestern town in one episode, go to Las Vegas in another episode, and become detectives in yet another episode. And even though the show presents a reality that is filtered through a TV lens, it does present a snapshot of pre-9/11 America, which was much more laid back and pleasant than it is today.

Another reason to watch these episodes is because of the sheer number of interesting guest appearances by actors and actresses on differing stages of their career trajectory. We get to see future stars (Eva LaRue, Halle Berry, and Leah Lail), people in the decline phase of their careers (Jenilee Harrison, Tawny Kitaen, Henry Polic II and Ruth Buzzi), and people who always seem to be popping up in TV and movies (Marvin Kaplan, Teresa Ganzel and John Astin). We also get an early appearance by Doug Dale in one episode (who later would host another cult favorite, ""TV Funhouse"").

While this show is not exactly classic TV, if you saw this show during its original run and have fond memories of it, you will likely find it well worth the price. Fans of Dean Cameron (who is still a working actor) will also likely appreciate the show. And if you have a jonesing for early 1990s kitsch, this may be the show for you.

I did, however have some points of contention with this DVD release. At least two episodes (one of the episodes was ""Look Who's Barking""; I don't remember what the other episode(s) were) had scratches on some of the frames. While it is understandable that after over 20 years, there might be some degradation in the quality of stored videotapes, these scratches could easily have been removed prior to release. In addition, there are no extras on the DVD or any commentaries. While this is offset somewhat by the low price of the DVD (there are 20 episodes and as of this writing, it's priced at $13.99, so you're getting a lot for your money), it would have been nice to have these extras.

In spite of this, I give this DVD set a thumbs up. ""They Came From Outer Space"" won't be everyone's cup of tea (although it has held up over time surprisingly well), and you're most likely to enjoy this DVD set if you liked the show during its initial run (or if you're a Dean Cameron fan). But it does provide a fun diversion from a lot of the dreck churned out for TV nowadays. I hope that I live to see the end of reality TV, but even if I don't, at least I'll have fond memories of Bo and Abe's misadventures.",1428796800,4,4933,4.77725674091442

8493834,5,B00668IFCU,"I love this series. I was in high school when it came out and it was one of the highlights of my weekend. My girlfriend and I still love it. I always had a thing for Dean Cameron and she always liked Stuart Fratkin. We even still quote it all the time, even before getting the complete series on DVD. We love to sing ""Old MacDonald had a Psychopath"".
It is great to have the full series. My only issue is that the discs are not numbered. My case was broken when it arrived and the discs where out and unnumbered. We had to find an online episode guide, but the online listing and the episodes on the discs have a slight discrepancy, though I doubt it matters much.
Overall: This is an awesome show. Ok, it is a little cheesy and very 90's, but I think that's why it is so great. It is a great escape fantasy, nothing serious, lots of lame jokes and just all around fun.",1366070400,4,869,4.117647058823529
8493835,5,B00668IFCU,"My husband & I watched this crazy show when it first aired in 1990.  We loved it then and still find it hilarious!  In a nutshell, it's a TV series about twin brothers Bo & Abe from the planet Crouton who come to earth because their parents want them to get a good education at Cambridge University in England.  They have other plans, though--to have fun & meet babes up & down the coast of California!  Bo is always trying to hook virgin Abe up because he literally feels what Abe experiences and vice versa.  To add even more intrigue to that winning TV formula, two bumbling air force guys are also in pursuit of Bo and Abe & want to dissect them!
Bo & Abe's adventures include, among others, scanning ""Score"" magazine for dates & meeting a dominatrix (nothing too racey--it's a clean show I would give a PG rating to); getting bullied at an all-girls school that just started accepting boys; meeting gorgeous ""black widow"" aliens from a different planet; judging a beauty contest in a small town where the judges have a history of entering the grave post-contest; becoming top stylists at a beauty salon that hired them to ruin the business; winning a booby prize of a TV station in a raffle.  .  . all while in the pursuit of beautiful women!
It's hard to describe what kind of person this humor would appeal to.  It's kind of along the lines of the old ""Airplane"" movies, or the ""Sledgehammer"" series from the 1980's.  It's definitely what I would describe as off-beat, but a lot of fun!",1354147200,5,1493,4.5
