5003510,5,B006LLY8OQ,"I read the visual novel and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I got this and the first season and after watching both they stay true to the spirit of the novel. There are certain things changed that make it so you don't instantly know everything that is going to happen, and the stories are tied up together better in the anime than in the novel, but otherwise it stays very true to the original novel. I must complain that two of the episodes are kind of bad at one part (you'll know when you see it) but if you're a fan of the visual novels you should definitely not second guess yourself when it comes to supporting the creators and getting yourself a nice no click-version of the novel. Awesome awesome, and more awesome; although if the dubs are terrible but you probably already knew that",1332288000,4,787,4.360544217687075

8500388,5,B006LLY8OQ,"I have just finished this season and all I can think is WOW.

Ef is a seriously addictive and unique anime like nothing I've seen or read before. The story is put together in such an interesting way it's hard not to be drawn into it. It's simply beautiful in all aspects. The art for one is gorgeous and a pleasure to watch each scene. Ef  has a very artistic taste and it flows into every moment of this season, it is not plain in any way.

Story wise it has to be my favourite anime. It has a much more adult feel to this season, more tragic things happen but it carries through it the unique storytelling of the Ef series.

Ef -  A Tale Of Melodies is heartbreakingly beautiful and has a permanent spot in my collection. As it should in yours.",1382918400,2,746,4.152777777777778

8500390,5,B006LLY8OQ,"This is the 2nd season of ef series. It focuses on some of the supporting characters of the 1st season. Kuze and Mizuki have been spending time together and become romantically involved. Kuze is suffering from a fatal heart disease and doesn't have much time left. Himura and Yuko's past is also the other part of the story. Both stories are very tragic and emotional, especially the one between Himura and Yuko. I finally understand why he was so melancholic in season 1. He's a strong person. I never liked Kuze very much in the 1st season, but he makes a major personality improvement from being with Mizuki in this season. He's not such a bad guy after all.

This anime is great. The animation is top quality, the music is beautiful and the characters are compelling. The story of these four characters is amazing. The love they share is a beautiful thing. Even though it is mostly a sad story it's very uplifting as well. This is one of the most well written animes I've seen, and I own over 200 different series. I really hope you check this one out and enjoy it as much as I do. If you like Clannad, Kanon, Air, or Angel Beats, you will like ef as well. If you haven't seen the others I've mentioned; they are a must have as well.",1350086400,3,1237,4.378260869565217
8500391,3,B006LLY8OQ,"This is the second ""season"" of an anime that is based off of a visual novel. If you haven't seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ef-A-Tale-of-Memories-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B005XB8T90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ef ~ A Tale of Memories: Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>], the first season of this show, you should consider watching it first. I have seen many different animes during my time as a fan, and most of them have been of the romance and drama genre. This review will not contain any spoilers, but I will address a few of the plot issues I had while watching the series.

Some people have labeled this show as a masterpiece, but I must disagree. I've watched hundreds of animes centering on Romance and Drama so I do think my opinion is well aged and seasoned with many different sources of inspiration. The main problem I have with this entire season is the forced drama. Please understand that I am not suggesting that drama created by the author is a bad thing. I understand that is what writing a story is. However, I take issue with what I would consider poor writing without essential build up or reasoning for events to take place.

In a perfect world, I would hope that any story revolving around romance would focus primarily on the characters. Romance is a story about people and their interactions with others, it's not something that can be explained to an audience in one scene. The setting, background information, and supporting characters are all important, but they should never replace the characters as the focal point of the story. In Melodies, we are hit with two different plots that essentially force us to care about something that we don't have any connection to. I don't want to go into detail due to my concern for creating spoilers, but for half of the shows focus there is close to no build up or information for why something is going to happen. You are hit over the head with it and then forced to accept it as a truth. Instead of a gradual and well rounded story its almost as if you were to turn the page and find yourself in a completely different setting with completely different characters.

It's unnerving how little the audience was considered.

All of that being said, from a technical aspect the show is by no means a push over. The art style, music, and characters are all reasonably solid and make for an enjoyable watch. However, this is a very drama heavy series and I would be tempted to say it has nothing to do with Memories other than introducing supporting characters. (Hey, they had to let the audience connect to the show somehow... because it sure wasn't going to be the story.) If you're watching this because you really enjoyed Memories and want to see more of the characters and their interactions, this is NOT the show for you.

If you're more into mature and adult themed shows and really enjoy dark themes, this will be an excellent series for you. Keep in mind I would only offer this as a recommendation to those who can get over the pacing of the story and how far removed it is from the prequel. Some may enjoy this series, but unfortunately it was not for me.",1348444800,5,3183,4.8010948905109485
8500392,5,B006LLY8OQ,"As imagined Japanese version of ""a tale of melodies"" is much better than translated one. Reason is selection of voice actresses. Since there are so many voice actresses in Japan, no wonder the quality of supremacy is self evident.",1343692800,,230,4.923076923076923
8500393,5,B006LLY8OQ,"An excellent series in every sense of the word, and a fantastic conclusion to the first season.

I cried buckets, for one.

One of the things that really stands out to me with ""ef"" is the scenes where the characters are delivering monologues.  Those tend to use the most interesting, creative artistic/animation techniques to convey the emotions.  It's really cool.

The characters are all believable, going through all sorts of emotions themselves, and developing/changing as the story goes on.

I really don't know how else to describe it, other than that it's one of the most well done series' that I've watched in a long time.

If you're looking for an action show, or sci-fi, or adventure, look elsewhere.  Ef is a romance, and an emotional rollercoaster.",1334793600,2,760,4.929133858267717
8500394,5,B006LLY8OQ,"Ef a tale of melodies is more complicated than the first season and very tragic. I'd call it a mix of inhumane and beautiful. I won't spoil the ending, but its good at the best (Clannad After Story still beats them all), especially for a psychological thriller like this. If you havn't watched ef a tale of memories yet, I'd give that a go first or else you won't understand anything that's happening in a tale of melodies. I actually played a fan translation of the visual novel before I watched this season and there are many differences included in the series than what is seen in the game. Most of the cast from Clannad is here playing the English dub, there's EVERY textless opening and ending clip as the bonus features, DVD credits and Sentai previews, advertising Clannad After Story (even though that was released last year), A-Channel and four others. The music in this anime is very deep and beautiful and fits perfectly in tragic scenes. The art is breathtaking and has a unique style of seeing illusionary characteristics that only a particular character is aware of. For example, Kuze sees himself wearing masks all the time, Mizuki is seen with a red string of fate on her hand, she's seen in sky colors like the first season and Yuko has a bunch of Renassance art behind her (make sense?). For those of you looking for a good, solid romance/high school drama/psychological anime, this one hits the target. You won't be disappointed. Just be mentally prepared for the thrill ride this 12 episode series will bring you through. Some things are just hard to accept, but like I said, this series ends very beautifully.

8500395,5,B006LLY8OQ,This is one if my favorite animes because it reaches unto he depths of ones soul. It's a romance but it's also very psychological. I recommend it along with the first part of the series.,1333324800,,186,4.3428571428571425
