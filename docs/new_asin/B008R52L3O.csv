5178796,5,B008R52L3O,I love Degrassi and wanted to know what happened to Eclare. I highly recommend this show to anyone that loves Degrassi.,1353888000,,119,4.714285714285714
5178797,5,B008R52L3O,"As soon as I got it, I watched it until the end. Like I said before, it never gets boring. Now I'm patiently waiting for season 12 to be released!",1351468800,3,146,3.9
5178798,3,B008R52L3O,"For anyone who saw the first half of season 11, they saw the nonstop intensity of the seniors final moments as well as everybody else. After the Dead and Gone finale, this half (which portrays the new school year to winter break) was just mediocre at best. Anya, Chantay, Holly J, Riley, Sav, and Zane are gone. As well as Wesley (he is in the credits but does not appear ONCE). In their place we have new freshmen with refreshing storylines as well as the addition of Mo to main cast. The Bianca-Drew-Vince case is never shown again as Bianca barely appears -.- Fiona gets a ton of plots but she is way too overused and Imogen has a complete turn in character. Katie does the same. Theres more Eclare nonsense which will appeal to all the fangirls as well as the return of Connor. Marisol and Dave have their time to shine. Basically this half was eh (if you don't LOVE Eclare or Fiona)",1348185600,6,887,4.381818181818182
5178799,5,B008R52L3O,"This part of the season was soo great, can't wait for season 12 part 1 on dvd!! I love the last episode!! Eclare is Endgame!!! <3",1347321600,4,129,4.0
5178800,5,B008R52L3O,"After the terrific first part of Season 11 Part 1. We move on to Season 11 Part 2 which is the first semester of the new year and now that, Chantay, Anya, Holly J, Sav, Riley, And Zane are gone. We have new freshmen which is kinda weird and stupid because you can't replace the seniors because they were awesome except for Chantay I mean she was so annoying and she was on the show since Season 4 and had like no story lines and she should have graduated like in Season 9 but anyways new drama, New faces and new horrific Degrassi which starts this season with the two episode special no where to run which was very cool to begin the season because Degrassi doesn't really do that stuff, But yeah. The first half of Season 11 premiered 29 episodes and now this second half has less then that. It only has 16 episodes which is 13 episodes less but hey it was a really good second half season. This season was pretty good and also this is the final season to have the school uniforms which rocks because I miss seeing all the students where regular clothes and not school uniforms. Anyways Fiona returns again to repeat another year of senior year and she meets new people such as Marisol and Katie. But Fiona doesn't know why she trusted them after they do something so unfair to her. Bianca and Drew may hook up again after Katie does drug's. Also can Clare date Jake since their parents got married or will they be brother and sister. New Degrassi is here and I love the show. I can't wait for more Degrassi coming soon to DVD. That is my review on Season 11 Part 2. :)",1344038400,3,1570,4.271812080536913
