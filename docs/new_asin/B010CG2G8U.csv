7307305,5,B010CG2G8U,"I'm a huge fan of horror and comedy and this film blends them perfectly! I've enjoyed each Caesar and Otto film for this very reason. In this instalment they focus on the Halloween/paranormal cliches and parody them wonderfully! This was a slightly more PG13 film with more salty language and a very brief flash of nudity so if you have kids I'd check it out before they watch it (but what do I know? I've been watching slasher flicks since I was 4!). The brilliant writing always leaves me in stitches and usually has a few lines I'm quoting for months. The whole cast was perfect for their roles. It was great to see Deron Miller back as the priest giving scandalous sermons in his knickers. I can't help but smile at Caesar's lisping, narcissistic voice. I sincerely hope this wonderful group of actors keeps this duo alive! They prove that you don't need a huge budget to make a great film, just a good script, a love for the film and loads of talent.",1447286400,4,955,4.462857142857143
7307306,5,B010CG2G8U,"In the third instalment of the Caesar & Otto franchise the duo tackles Halloween and all things paranormal. I love the Caesar & Otto movies and this was no exception. Well written, well cast and wonderfully acted!! I hope these guys never stop making movies!",1447286400,4,258,4.7555555555555555
7307307,5,B010CG2G8U,"This was my first time seeing a Caesar and Otto movie so I can't compare it to the others.  I stumbled across this DVD after watching Monster Squad and looking at what the cast members had been up to.  Andre Gower is in this film so I decided to take a chance on it and was not disappointed.  This film is great for all the right reasons.  It has a terrific cast, really fun characters, serious laughs and some touching moments.  If you like movies made with enthusiasm straight from the heart you'll love Paranormal Halloween.  I can't wait to check out the other Caesar and Otto films.  Great job by Dave Campfield and company",1446336000,7,628,4.408695652173913
7307308,5,B010CG2G8U,"this is the 3rd and best Caeser and Otto film by far...im so proud to be a part of it and it was so much fun working on this with Dave and Paul and the entire cast...i just laughed and laughed...my son makes his film debut in this one. watch when my daughter morphs into my son Thomas. great story, great acting...there is nothing like it. its three stooges meets contemporary horror, a completely original idea. watch it very closely and pay attention because it moves pretty quick.",1445904000,3,483,4.5
7307309,5,B010CG2G8U,"Paranormal Halloween is the third installment of the comedy-horror series with Caesar and Otto. In my opinion, this is the finest of the trilogy. It takes a more toned down version of the slapstick comedy we've gotten from the previous films, and combines it with the horror cliches of some of our favorite movies, all the while managing to keep it legitimately entertaining. My favorite part of the Caeser and Otto series has always been the one-liners - and this film is no exception. They definitely contribute to the laugh out loud moments, and are paired perfectly with the physical comedy aspect. Deron Miller returns to this movie as a priest, and I must say, I much prefer over his previous role in Deadly Xmas. All of the cast are great. It's great to see some familiar faces and the new additions fit in just fine. While Caeser and Otto are the main focus of the film, all of the extra cast keep it interesting and keep it from getting stale. Does this movie have a Michael Bay budget? No, it doesn't - but that is part of the charm of this movie. However, having said that, this movie is one of the most genuinely entertaining movies I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that always has a smile on your face, even if nothing over the top is going on at the moment. It's a very intimate experience. It's fun. It's Caeser and Otto.",1445904000,4,1342,4.459349593495935

7307322,5,B010CG2G8U,"The phrase ""Caesar and Otto"" is an anagram.  Rearrange the letters and you get ""Donate a scrota,"" which (crudely put) means that it takes balls to put out a movie like this.  (This interpretation is supported by another anagram of those letters, again crudely put: ""A Sac Detonator"").  The letters also rearrange into ""A docent's aorta,"" which is quite meaningful: a docent, of course, is a volunteer at a museum, so the anagram suggests that it takes a lot of unpaid hours and heartiness to support the arts.  Though possibly revealing, we'll ignore other anagrams like ""A toad ancestor"" (implying humility) and ""Dates a cartoon.""  We rearrange letters in an attempt to figure out what exactly is so charming about Dave Campfield's projects.  We try to figure out why, exactly, he's making Caesar and Otto films and not exploring other directions.  His seriously spooky film Dark Chamber was met by a viewership unequipped to appreciate an excellent script and an honest effort, so it's clear why he has switched gears.  Looking beyond the budget constraints and the apparent frivolousness, there's actually still a lot of serious craftsmanship -- it's disguised by the general wackiness, but the hours that went into this production reveal themselves to viewers who bother to look more deeply.  Whether we hope Campfield will explore new directions is beside the point.  This is what he's doing, and it's funny.  Going back to our original anagrams, there's one more that might sum it all up: ""A scrota atoned.""",1455235200,,1513,5.012
7307323,1,B010CG2G8U,I couldn't make it through the first ten minutes.  Do not waste your time.,1454976000,,74,4.285714285714286

7307325,5,B010CG2G8U,"The film opens as a spoof on slasher films and then moves on to spoof both modern and classic horror films, including ""Poltergeist"", ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Shining."" The comedy is nearly non stop and an ""explanation"" is offered at the end of the film, which I didn't see coming in spite of the clues that were dropped. And to be honest, I didn't expect an explanation and wasn't looking for one.

The extras include ""B"" horror show stars such as Tiffany Shepis (Frankenstein Syndrome, Bonnie and Clyde vs Dracula, and Night of the Demons-the remake) Debbie Rochon, Brinke Stevens, Felissa Rose, Vernon Wells, Guy Hunsinger, and Sean Whale to name a few.  There are numerous references to their past films, too many to grasp as well as Dr. Pheel.

Oh yeah, then there was that Bible thing when they imitate the betrayal.

7307327,1,B010CG2G8U,"This is the 8th review of a truly crappy movie. The other reviews are positive, which led me to 5 minutes of hell. After 5 minutes, I stopped watching. As the only other realistic reviewer writes: Tries hard, but amateurish. I'm shocked that Rob Zombie lent himself to a cameo in it. I wonder if HE was shocked at well, when he sat in the movie's premier. The acting was lousy, the filming was equivalent to a high school film crew's summer project. Don't even waste 5 minutes on this stinker. Use those 5 minutes to do something useful, like boil an egg or find something better to watch.

8721940,4,B010CG2G8U,"If you're looking for a slick studio horror picture, you are bound to be disappointed. Caesar and his half-brother Otto accept an assignment to act as the winter care takers at a rich weirdo's remote residence. Caesar is looking forward to getting some writing done on his screenplay and... if you don't know where this is going, you need to consume more media (I suggest you start with The Shinning, the Simpson's episode). What follows is a fast-paced comedy that lovingly skewers all kinds of movie tropes and trends (side-boob, anyone?) before we all learn an important lesson about family.

There is plenty of parody without being over-the-top. Campfield is clearly a fan of these big budget movies, but also recognizes that they are pretty silly sometimes. As Caesar would put it, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.",1503792000,,831,4.9784172661870505

8721942,5,B010CG2G8U,"""Caesar and Otto's Paranormal Halloween"" is a sure thing for a fun time! A tight budgeted movie made with heart and nothing more than the audience in mind. Sure, it's not a big budget Hollywood movie, but have you seen Hollywood lately? This is a movie made by true film stars! From the ensemble cast to everybody who pitched in behind the camera to make this film possible. This film is also filled with cameo's by some of the most famous faces you can't help but recognize!
  What makes this film stand out from other films on a limited budget? It's the fact that filmmaker/star Dave Campfield (and his cast and crew) knows what he is working with and doesn't try to pull it past you. He knows where the joke/idea might not come off so he uses it intentionally to let you in on the joke, which i believe makes it that much funnier. How many other filmmakers out there do that?
  With nothing but reboots and half-assed crap from Hollywood nowadays, I find it refreshing to finally watch something clever, fun and original, and set with comedy that's based more off the golden years of comedy instead of the same old harsh jokes that just push it too far these days. You can't go wrong with this film because it's something you haven't seen before, and it is a great way to spend an hour and a half.
  Also, how can you go wrong with a film that's actually part of an already established series? For those who are bashing it, maybe you should take another look because apparently these guys are doing something right!",1481068800,,1518,4.462093862815885

Caesar and Otto may not be a gut busting laugh, but it is truly entertaining to those who understand what goes into actually making a movie like this. As a matter of fact, Caesar and Ottos Paranormal Halloween won first placeat  a sci-fi festival, and sold out its first day of release on Amazon.  Give credit to the creators, writers, and actors who love this genre. If u want to see thrills and chills, spend big bux at the theatre.
