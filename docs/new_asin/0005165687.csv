This must be a mistake...I've seen a couple of other items here on Amazon for what seemed liked unbelievable high prices...but this ""takes the cake"" as my friend peeking over my shoulder as a write this just said.",1280188800,,312,4.288135593220339
7901773,4,0005165687,"It's a shame Jonathan didn't make another video. This video is funny, but the jokes are somewhat dated seeing as this tape was recorded quite a while ago. There are parts that just aren't funny and other parts that will have you rolling on the floor! He says things I've never heard anyone use before and that's the mark of a good comedian. This is a very good video, but not something you'd want to pull out in front of a crowd. Most people will probably think it's corny. When he's good, he's really good. When he misses it, you can still forgive him because you're still holding your sides about that last joke he told!!! =)=)=)

Oh yeah, this is a good, clean Christian comedian so a lot of the jokes you'd have to be a church goer (specifically to a ""black church"") to get the punchline. If you are, you'll have a great time listening to him!
