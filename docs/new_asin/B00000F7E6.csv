1205491,2,B00000F7E6,"Lower than average thriller/drama (?) about ""intellectual European colonial elite's guilt"" (?). For having been ""colonial""? For ""class differences""? Nothing very convincing.

I got bored, never felt anything for any character, and the famous little scene was just mechanically shocking. Binoche shows her class, even if she's a bit plumpier and dressed awfully on purpose. Auteil is always good as a neurotic, paranoid, a troubled character. For those who saw him at ""L'Adversaire"", there are interesting parallels for one to make. But whereas adversaire is truly shocking, this one is about nothing. And slow...

Pierrot (!) (their kid) is ok, as the Algerians. Which are given all the good ""lines"" and are always good. In comparison with ""the mean Laurents"": a ""violent"" male and the archetypal ""neurasthenic"" wife. I disagree with reviewers like who say (showing great intelligence nevertheless) that ""the director doesn't take sides"".

This is an European film wanting to make fellow Europeans feel bad about themselves. So predictable! Seen from an under developed country, I think it achieves the contrary effect it purports: I guess anybody ""right wing"" must end up feeling Algerians/ Latinos/ whichever minority is cleaning their houses is a potential enemy. And ascribing a tantrum of a 5 year old the full responsibility of another person's destiny, and even of whole nations (""as a metaphor""), is so ridiculous it's funny. I am used to ""open ended"" films, and I love French cinema. But is this really ""European cinema"" or just its pantomime? Anyway, there a thousands of better films out there. Not even the music and photography are any good.

Angelino Todd Squires' interpretation in Amazon that it is a specially ""voyeuristic"" film is bright.

Poppedculture from Canada in IMDB has some good imaginary points, like Georges making a living of manipulating images. But I think is somewhat

confused politically.",1148515200,12,1923,5.26797385620915

1205493,5,B00000F7E6,"The film opens with a static long shot of a private villa nestled between buildings of lesser standing on a quiet Parisian street, over which the credits appear in a teletypewriter fashion. Nothing is happening except for an occasional passer-by hurrying across the screen. After a while, the image is shown going backward: we then realize that we were watching a video recording that protagonist Georges Laurent (Daniel Auteuil) is rewinding on his VCR, after having viewed it on his television set. We then see, this time from the point of view of the camera, Georges and his wife Anne (Juliette Binoche) watching the video of their own villa on their television. This VHS tape, sent anonymously, had materialized mysteriously at their doorstep.

Georges is a prominent television personality who hosts a literary program, and Anne works for a publishing house. They have an adolescent son, Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky). Together, they form a family of ordinary bourgeois, living a quiet and comfortable life, protected from the outside world by money and culture, surrounded by an homogeneous circle of friends. Soon, another tape appears, wrapped in a childish drawing of a child throwing up blood. Pierrot is also the recipient of the same drawing at his school. Later on, as the Laurents are hosting a dinner, someone rings the front door bell: nobody is at the door but another videotape is left, once more wrapped up in a childish sketch depicting a bird (a chicken?) with its neck cut off and bleeding. This video, shot from inside a car, shows a country road leading to the farm of Georges' parents, where Georges was raised.

Who is filming? What at first was thought to be a prank or some kind of bad joke starts to worry both Georges and Anne. They go to the police, who refuse to do anything, since there has been no overt threat or blackmail of any kind. A climate of tension and paranoia settles in, and Georges decides to solve the mystery himself. Obviously, the author of these videos appears to know a lot about Georges and his past. Little by little, Georges seems to remember some childhood events involving Majid, the son of Algerian farmhands who worked on his parents' farm.

The Algerian couple had been killed on 17 October, 1961, during a peaceful demonstration organized by the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) against a curfew imposed on all Algerian citizens in Paris. France Interior Minister Frey and Police Prefect Papon ordered that this demonstration be handled ""properly,"" an order which resulted in the death of up to two hundred Algerians, most of whom drowned when they were thrown by the police into the Seine. One must also recall that during WWII, the same Papon served under the Vichy Government in the same capacity, and was directly involved in the deportation of the French Jews to the German concentration camps-- if one thing can be said about Papon is that he was not a racist: Moslems, Jews, all the same to him. (Papon was FINALLY sentenced in 1998 for crimes against humanity, but only served three years...)

Following the death of his parents, Georges' parents were ready to adopt young Majid (Walid Afkir). However, the six-year-old Georges strongly resented his new bother-to-be and tried his best to discredit him in the eyes of his parents. First, Georges pushed young Majid to commit a violent act toward a farm animal, a rooster, and then told his parents that Majid was spitting blood and thus was most likely infected with tuberculosis. Confronted with this apparent truth of young Majid's character and his physical condition, Georges' parents did not adopt him, but instead sent him to an orphanage. Georges never saw Majid again, but he becomes more and more convinced that Majid has re-appeared, seeking to revenge the wrong done to him.

The situation created by these disturbing drawings and videos shows how much Georges and Anne, contrary to the appearances, have drifted apart from one another. Georges is not forthcoming about his suspicions, which would also reveal his youthful cruelty. Anne assumes Georges' silence regarding his suspicions indicates his lack of trust, making her question their relationship. Georges seems to have a clear conscience, so much so that he tries to identify the mysterious stalker, but as he stubbornly tries to preserve his social and familial status quo, he only succeeds in getting into deeper trouble.

Suffice to say that if Cache were a Hollywood pabulum production, the rest of the film would be quite predictable. But this is a film by anti-conformist and provocateur Michael Haneke, who is known to play with his viewers, destabilizing them by using non-conventional mise-en-scenes, enjoying putting his viewers in the difficult and uncomfortable position of voyeurs. So, I must stop here my recalling of the film's synopsis, lest I spoil prospective viewers' enjoyment of the film.

Cache is a psychological thriller, clinical and cold, but also fascinating, which invites the viewer to carry on his or her own investigation as the film progresses. It recalls one of the best French thrillers ever made, Le Corbeau (1943), Henri-Georges Clouzot's film about a French village torn apart by a series of poison-pen letters. As with all his other films, the screenplay of Cache is by Haneke. The violence shown here is not physical, as in Haneke's past films, in particular as in Funny Games, except for one flash in a long take toward the middle of the film, which sends the theatre audience gasping in unison. In Cache, the primary violence is psychological, but the result on the viewer is the same as if it was physical. Once more Haneke works with the same material as he did in his trilogy of ""emotional glaciation:"" a bourgeois family with an adolescent son confronted with an exterior menace, which is materialized by images. From the very first long plan-sequence of an unremarkable scene, an unfathomable, frightening feeling surfaces. As the minutes tick by, it is not the eye of the camera but our own which is alert to the slightest noise, the slightest change. The rewinding of the video tape comes as liberation, but at the same time it confirms our anguish. Haneke mixes up the filmed reality with the reality of the film, depriving us of any point of reference, and we are left with a feeling of anguish, loneliness, and finally distress. Not only are the camera and its operator hidden from view, but the act of filming itself is also hidden from our senses. Nevertheless, everything in the plot follows and develops from the clues left by each drawing and each video tape. The",1148256000,32,6615,4.943345323741007
1205494,5,B00000F7E6,"Georges and Anne Laurent have a great life: Georges is a successful television host of a book discussion and review program and Ann does book and author p.r. They have a beautiful home and a smart and caring, 12 year old son, Pierrot. Then one day a package arrives containing a vhs tape wrapped in a drawing of a blood spattered man. The tape is of Georges and Ann's house, taken from across the street: they are being watched. But by whom and why? The packages continue to arrive, the tapes become more confrontational and the drawings more graphic.

Director and Screenwriter, Michael Haneke (the controversial and blatantly sexual ""The Piano Teacher"") is operating on several levels and his motives are almost entirely implicit though ""Cache'"" on a very basic level is very tightly wound, suspenseful and operates on the very highest level of intelligence: as in the very best films, Haneke shows rather than tells us.

As the movie progresses and the tapes become more personal, Georges is forced to confront the sins of his past and that of his family towards an Algerian orphan, Majid who once lived with Georges family.

Haneke is on a first name basis with Obsession and the obsessive personality: the wheres, the whys and the hows. ""The Piano Teacher"" is nothing if not a treatise on the big ""O."" Deeply hidden in the bowels of his psyche, Georges guilt also becomes an obsession: is he a participant in his own victimization? Is he sending himself the tapes and the gruesome pictures as a way of expiating his guilt?

""Cache'"" addresses the French Algerians ongoing conflict with the French government both socially and morally, issues of personal and collective Guilt as well as the complicated morass of wife/husband relationships... particularly those dealing with communication or lack thereof.

The films ambiguous final scene shot at Pierrot's school at the end of the school day with students mingling, talking, joking with each other,just being young...is troubling and infuriating in its dense obtuseness; particularly when Majid's son shows up: there are at least four ways of interpreting this scene and each one can be supported by what is up on the screen: masterful.

 ""Cache'"" is a refined, intelligent and difficult film. Haneke does not offer any easy answers and absolutely no solutions nor does he allow his characters any absolution. The road here is jammed with moral pot holes and danger signs. Proceed with caution: ""Cache's"" journey may be difficult but the destination is rife with relevant and well observed lives in turmoil.",1144281600,50,2562,5.0

1205606,5,B00000F7E6,"This is one big spoiler, so don't read this until after youve seen the film, and do see it, it is superb.  This is my speculation as to who was responsible for the surveillance tapes.  It wasn't any of the characters in the film but rather the director Michael Haneke; he played a part in his own movie.  What had happened back in 1961--the killing of the Algerian Majids parents and two hundred other demonstrators by the Paris police, and Majids subsequent expulsion from Georges family because of Georges foul deeds--was wrong.  None of the characters in the drama was in a position to surface this injustice, so Haneke did it himself.  And he signals what he is up to:

 No one but him could have gotten the surveillance camera in the first scenes as high up in the air--at least ten feet high, towering over cars and people--and as far away from the building.

 At 13:17 on my DVD there is a large shadow on the left of the screen that sure looks like a movie camera to me.

 None of the characters in the film was likely to have had access to the professional level videotape used in the surveillance, or bothered to use it if somehow he did have access to it.

 It appears Anne received a phone call from the stalker.  All the usual suspects either had an accent or a youthful voice, and she would have noted that fact to Georges, but she didnt.  It was Haneke on the other end of the line.

 The dialogue in the first encounter between Georges and Majid and the surveillance tape of it don't match, and only Haneke could have made that happen.

 The last scene in the movie, where Majids son and Georges son Pierrot spoke in front to the school steps, which led a lot of people to conclude that they were in cahoots, had to be about something other than making the surveillance tapes, because neither one of them could have done it.  For that matter, their connection may have had nothing to do with anything, because those were two actors who did whatever Haneke told them to do.

To end with an aside, Im suspicious Haneke, not one of the characters in the film, was the one who tripped the horse in The White Ribbon.",1440374400,5,2127,4.388746803069053

Wouldn't there be some communication between the orphan and the couple before they just shipped him kicking and screaming off?  I know the seed has been planted by their six year old son that the orphan is coughing up blood.  Something they never witnessed.

Secondly, the main character wore the same outfit the whole movie; such really takes from the experience.

1205690,2,B00000F7E6,"Cache starts out with the disturbing discovery that a successful talk show host and his talented wife and son are being spied upon in their home and that the spy seems to know intimate details of their lives.  It's a great set up which deflates completely as we discover the identity of the spy and his agenda.  Despite the excellent cast, good acting, marvelous initial suspense and fine dialogue, the movie peters out into nothing.  What is hidden is not shameful or awful, just sad and unfortunate.  Hardly the earthshaking secret promised by the build-up.

What is the shaming secret at the heart of the harassment of the talk show host?  Well, we learn that as a child of perhaps 8 or 10 years old, he resented his parents taking in an Algerian orphan boy whose immigrant parents were killed in the notorious 1961 riots in Paris.  The child manages to engineer an incident which casts the orphan in a bad light which turns the parents against the orphan, who is placed in an orphanage; the little orphan grows up to a low level job and a life in the lower middle class.  We are to believe that if only the orphan had been allowed to remain in this family, he'd have been as successful and had as many opportunities as the talk show host.

This, then, is the ""awful"" secret of our talk show host: that a petty, malicious act committed by him as a child, is deemed to have ruined the orphan's life, for which our talk show host, now an adult, should be held responsible and an object of profound contempt.

It is interesting, to say the least, that a child's actions would be judged by standards applicable to an adult; that a child, long before his brain had reached the developmental stage of being able to empathize with others, before attaining mental maturity, should be held responsible for understanding the meaning and consequences of his actions upon others.  This indicates a rather profound failure of understanding on the part of the director of human psychological development.

One must also add that the director seems unaware of the profound social injustice of his nation and the lack of advancement for immigrants in France, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.  The idea that the orphan might have advanced and prospered in the France of the '60s and '70s, just as the talk show host did, for this is the implicit premise of the film, is a threadbare fantasy belied by the condition of immigrants and ethnic minorities in France today, packed into the banlieus circling the capital, a no go zone for the police.  Precious few like the fictional orphan of this film have ever escaped the banlieus.  This fantasy turns the film into a farce.

While Georges tries his best to deny this, the truth comes back to haunt him. CACH is a film about (re-) presentation, and how human beings deliberately construct versions of their lives so as to justify their behavior.  This not only takes place in the media, but in Georges' personal life as well.  As a director, Haneke implicates himself in the same process; he is constructing a version of 'reality' through the film just like Georges.  Such strategies damage other peoples' lives, especially when issues of racism are involved: as a child Georges destroyed Majid's life by telling deliberate lies; and now the two of them have grown up, Georges tries to do the same both to Majid and his son (Walid Afkir). CACH is a complex film that perhaps could have done with a little injection of pace: on at least a couple of occasions I found my attention wandering.

The main focus of the movie would appear to be how Georges deals with the guilt he carries over a selfish act he comitted at the age of 6.  However, the ultimate tragedy of the film would clearly NOT have occurred if it were not for the tapes. Consequently, the more serious culpability here is completely glossed over because it is Georges the movie is focused on. While one could certainly find interest in the guilt carried by Georges, the fact that it is completely overshadowed by the ultimate responsibility of the voyeur and his tapes makes that apparently unknown individual the far more interesting case.  Presumably that individual wanted to remind and reinforce Georges guilt-- something perfectly consistent with Majid's invitation to witness the suicide.  If instead, the voyeur was Majid's son, the guilt he would have to carry for his own father's death would be significant.  And any other party would have to carry even more.  Consequently only if Majid was himself responsible as Georges ultimately concludes, leaves the most important moral questions in focus, and in fact, are Majid's not Georges'.",1346976000,2,1324,5.018264840182648

1205899,5,B00000F7E6,"Cache (Hidden) (2005)
Drama, Mystery, Thriller. 117 minutes, French Language
Directed by Michael Haneke
Starring Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche

Cache won't have wide appeal and I wouldn't blindly recommend the film to everyone. Haneke doesn't explain all of the events in an obvious way, but the details do provide a solution for viewers who are prepared to give the film their full attention.

The story opens with a stationary video of an apartment in a typical neighborhood. We see people pass and one or two people leave the building. No explanation is given at this point; we are merely observers. The shot turns out to be a video and the inhabitants of the apartment are watching it. Someone is taping their movements and leaving the recordings on their doorstep. No notes are included.

Are the tapes meant for them? Who is recording them and for what purpose? How would you react in that situation? Would you trust your instincts and try to work out who would have a motive? Would you be frightened and inform the police? What about people you know? Would you explain the situation to friends and colleagues, or keep it a secret? The people under surveillance are Georges (Auteuil), Anne (Binoche) and their son Pierrot. Are they in danger?

The film unfolds slowly. We see how their normal patterns change to combat any potential risk. The relationship between Georges and Anne also changes. Do they completely trust each other? Shouldn't they be totally united against the perceived threat rather than holding back information from one another? The dynamic between the two is one of the most interesting things in the film.

The plot plays out like a Hitchcock mystery. It partly reminds me of Rear Window, where we see events from a fixed point and speculate about people's motivations. But, in contrast, we are shown other locations too. Each one holds a clue about what is happening.

The acting and directing are superb throughout.

The main reason that I am hesitant to recommend this to everyone is the conclusion. The film appears to end suddenly without any apparent resolution, but the information is there if you are looking. A scene early in the film sets up part of the reveal. Haneke is asking us to play detective and piece the information together for ourselves. The fun is in the process rather than finding out who is responsible. I find it compulsive viewing.",1330473600,2,2393,4.864864864864865

They barely break a sweat debating the if's, and's or but's of their situation.  The husband should be shaken to bits by Binoche on more than one occasion, but there's just a lot of dramatic head turning and respectful door closing. Only Majid leaves an impact.

Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche are fine in their central roles. Developments happen, and a few red herrings are thrown in, creating a somewhat fun mystery. If you have the DVD, Mr. Heneke will explain it all, and he leaves it up to the viewer to what really happened. Not boring at all, if you pay attention.

Before watching this film I recommend that you view the director's taped comments. Don't expect all the loose ends to be resolved. As Haneke says, there are no correct answers to what you see in the film. This is not a typical American film in which the mystery is solved in the final minutes and we can go home satisfied with the conclusion.
Haneke makes it clear that you, the viewer, have to draw your own conclusions. What we see are fragments, not a completed film, and we have to fill in the gaps to our own satisfaction. You might have to watch it at least two times to fully understand it.",1278201600,4,820,4.510067114093959
1205903,5,B00000F7E6,"Midday. The camera is focused on an alleyway and the apartment building adjacent to it. The screen remains fixed on this position, motionless. Pan back, and a husband and wife stare on in horror at the taped surveillance of their home from an unknown source. Who is behind these mysterious tapes, what do they mean, and what secrets might be revealed when their lives are exposed to the world? With this, Michael Haneke delivers another riveting thriller that leaves the audience guessing from beginning to end.

CACHE is often criticized for its overt social and political subtext, and while these themes are often apparent, they never become the driving force of the plot. Haneke's emotionless filming only serves to alienate the viewer, drawing a line of separation between them and the characters. The audience is only invited to observe but never to interact or invest themselves in the events as they unfold, a barrier that was visited first in Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM. The camera then becomes the only character with whom the audience can relate, but in keeping with the central theme of lies and deceit, the camera lies just as much as the characters themselves. It is impossible to tell which events are unfolding in actuality on screen, and which are pre-recordings that are playing back on a taped recording.

At times, CACHE also appears to be Haneke's reflection on the Italian Giallo, as it mirrors the structure and revelation of past events that was popularized by Dario Argento in the 70s. Another nod to Argento can be found in a single shocking moment of gore that closely resembles the brutal death of Jane in TENEBRE. Completely unlike the Italian mysteries, however, CACHE does not allow for any form of satisfying end, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers in its closing scenes. Just as he has done countless times before, Haneke also robs the viewer of a soundtrack to accompany the film, which builds on the sense of tension and unease that has already been established with each new package left on Georges and Anne's doorstep.

While Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche each provide powerful and convincing performances, it is Michael Haneke's signature style that wins in the end. Paranoia, fear, and suspense are each measured out in equal doses, keeping audiences on the knife's edge at every turn. CACHE will not be received well by all audiences, but it stands as both a thought provoking and engaging piece of film art.

I got something out of this I realized others didn't. It's mainly about French and Algerian relations. You won't understand that when watching it but may realize towards the end of the film. There is an immense amount of comparisons to the father acting like the French government and his relations to his family(citizens) and the very people who threaten his way of life. His relation to the Algerian people, the other key character, exemplifies an increasing level of stubbornness and disrespect. This film was after the French Riots and Sarkozy's statement about washing the ""scum"" immigrants out of the public housing complexes.

1205955,3,B00000F7E6,"I admit that I am a Francophile which gives me a rather high tolerance for a lot of pretentious French crapola.  There is a limit, though, and I was pleased to see the number of negative reviews here, as well as the more positive ones.  I agree with some of each.

On the plus side, in my scorecard, was the idea.  It's a fascinating concept--that an action a child did embedded itself in the person's mind, where it remains hidden until a series of bizarre threats and nightmares many years later brings it back to consciousness.  Haneke makes the point, in an interview which is included on the DVD, that it's ""the moral thing"" for a person to  accept guilt for his actions.  There is an obvious parallel to the country of France, which apparently did not accept guilt for its destructive actions when it colonized Algeria.

He extends the idea of ""hidden"" things to other actions and characters in the film.  He hints, but doesn't really reveal, that the wife, Anne, (Juliet Binoche) may have had an affair with her employer, and that her child may even be that of the other man.
The protagonist, Georges, appears to hide a lot of his own actions, not confiding in Anne, which she resents. Haneke says that apparently the couple got into the habit of hiding things from the other, which has brought them to their present state of hostile co-existence.

The problem I had with the concept was that it is rather a stretch to blame the naughty but understandable actions of a five year old for the complete destruction of another man's life.  This is what we are expected to accept, and that's where the film lost its credibility for me.

On top of that is Haneke's refusal to let the audience in on what's really going on, in many key areas.  In his interview, he gloatingly states that he despises American films because they insist of revealing what's what, and have resolutions.  In his mind, this gives the viewer a lot to talk about....  However, to this viewer, even with my affection for many things French, he deprives us of so much information, that in the end, I really didn't care.  A little ""amibiguity"" goes a long way, in my book, and I'm not impressed by his elitist (snobby) stance.

The cast includes fine actors but they seem miscast or perhaps they are just mis-directed.  Daniel Auteuil is such naturally warm, charming actor that my sympathies were solidly with him, even though he was supposed to be the bad guy.  His wife, played by Binoche, was supposed to be the sympathetic one, but the portrayal by the usually charming actress, somehow left me in the cold.  Who knows?  After a while, I really didn't care a lot.  Too bad, it was a good idea.

For ""serious film students"" there is an enlightening interview with Haneke which does make the film more understandable.  It's very French, very philosophical, and I found it interesting, although I disagreed with some of his points. I could go into a long rant on the difference between blame and responsibility and how guilt figures into it, but this may not be the place.  Also, I think that a film should stand on its own merits, and not need an explanation to make it credible.",1269302400,7,3155,4.5910714285714285
1205956,1,B00000F7E6,"This is a very well written movie, with great acting and wonderful direction and photography.  It is also typical pretentious French crap.  A jealous little French boy through deceit deprives an Algerian child of a decent life in the French boy's home and sends him to an orphanage.  As the film reveals the ""hidden"" past, the puzzling torment of the now adult Frenchman is presented as the appropriate consequence of his childhood action.  Childhood at the orphanage has destroyed the Algerian.  This might well happen, but the film ignores any responsibility on the part of the Algerian, or indeed any real existence as a character.  He cuts his own throat in front of the Frenchman.
By suggesting that this French child's act equates with the atrocious French treatment of the Algerians, that the Algerian's awful life was the result of this one act by the French child, and that the maddening torment of the Frenchman is warranted, the film trivializes French national crimes against Algerians.  The Frenchman's well warranted guilt for his vicious childhood act does not in fact stand for French guilt for true enormities.

1205959,5,B00000F7E6,"I think what is so startling about `Cache' is that, when all is said and done, we are left with a `is that what this was about?' kind of feel that makes the atrocities that play out all the more haunting.  Auteur (yes, that is what he is) Michael Haneke is known for his obsession with violence.  He has tampered with the natural human tendency to react to and with violence many times (maybe most notably with `Funny Games') and each examination brings us closer to the same conclusion; there is no conclusion.  With `Cache', Haneke explores the unraveling of a man's life and how he choices to react to the situation he has put himself in.

The marvelous Daniel Auteuil plays Georges, a talk show star who finds himself (and his family) being tormented by a series of videotapes that are being left at his doorstep.  The tapes are harmless, yet chilling.  They are basically hours of footage, the first of Georges' house, the second of the home Georges grew up in, the third of a rainy drive to a crummy apartment.  The tapes don't seem to say much, but to Georges they say a lot.

Like I mentioned, for me it was the realization that `that was all' that really made me shiver.  This is a film that will shock you with his abruptness (just wait until the 89 minute mark) but will also shock you in its resolve.  The point is not to show the atrocities that lead to the atrocities but to show that sometimes atrocities are a direct result of something much more minor in comparison.

Did Georges' actions really warrant his punishment?

Haneke is a brilliant director, and the way he drenches each scene in this feeling on claustrophobia is just masterful.  There is this incessant need to dissect each sequence, from start to finish (I literally watched the opening and closing segments three times in order to take in everything), but the truth of the matter is that the film really is meant to be taken for face value (at least that's how I take it).  The more you try and pick apart a hidden (the word `Cache' means just that; hidden) meaning and motive the more you diminish the real core of the film.  The fact that the ending feels like a `letdown' for me is what makes this movie so clever.

Haneke baited us, and then pretty much told us that what we wanted just wasn't realistic.

The performances across the board help propel this film into the eerie depths of reality it needed to embrace, especially from Auteuil.  Binoche is also outstanding in her conflicted paranoia and Maurice Benichou is unforgettable in his few short scenes.

UNFORGETTABLE!

This very same year we saw the release of `A History of Violence', a film that sported a huge following and showed director Cronenberg exploring the deep-rooted instinctual tendency of violence.  For me, Haneke's interpretation of the same subject is vastly superior and all the more chilling.  It is in this films soft and subtle crevices that one finds the most depth (watching a man get into bed has never been more chilling).",1260144000,4,2993,4.607547169811321

I was prepared not to like this film. I had hated director Haneke's previous Funny Games: not mindless violence, but intelligent, sadistic, senseless violence.
The reviews here on Hidden are mixed. Some of those who expected a thriller are disappointed or even bored.

The naked story (trying to make sense without spoiling it): a wealthy Paris family is being stalked. The stalker sends tapes, which at first show only that he has watched their house. Then he sends a tape of the husband's childhood place. Then a tape leading to a certain apartment in a recognizable street. The husband has a hunch from the start, but dissembles. His lies disturb the relation with his wife. The 12 y old son has his own puberty problems which add to the thriller layer of the story.
The husband visits the apartment and claims that nobody had been there. The next tape shows him in conversation inside the apartment.
The tape story drags on a bit. Our sympathies are entirely with the wife, who is almost unreasonably reasonable, under the circumstances.

Let me say, if this was a thriller and nothing else, it would come out here with about 3  stars from me: interesting enough, but not overwhelming.
But of course, say some, this is an allegory about France's guilt from the Algerian independence war.
There was a massacre in Paris on October 17 in 1961, when police killed somewhere between 200 and 300 Algerians; this happened, if I am not mistaken, after a demonstration. Sounds like Iran? Exactly!

The husband is digging into his memory and he finds ugly things. His parents had been about to adopt an Algerian boy when he himself was 6. The adoption was cancelled under ugly circumstances. The husband prefers to keep the lid down. The truth comes out in his nightmares. The final scene is possible only under sleeping medication.
The allegory interpretation says that the husband symbolizes France. He tries to forget his personal October 17.

The cinematography is based on the integration of the tapes into the story, to the extent of confusing us, certainly on purpose. We don't always know right away if we are here or there.
I am sure that generations of film students will find material for their thesis in this film.

In the end I am so fascinated that I can't avoid giving 5 stars, against my initial instinct. (And I had the added problem that my DVD was French without subtitles, so I lost some of the verbal communication, eg during the dinner party conversations, when no context helps in figuring out the conversation. It turns out that to some extent the language problem forced me to focus harder on the visual communication. Maybe one ought to watch more movies without tone, at least for the second time. If they are worth it. And one should watch only movies that are worth watching twice. Or have I said that before?)",1255219200,5,2926,4.759368836291913

One can surmise how the next two hours are going to go when the opening credit sequence is simply the film of a surveillance camera. That goes on for a full five minutes, and there is rarely much more action than that.

We discover very little about any of the characters or why they behave as they do. Aside from two brutalized Algerians (symbolic?), no one is even remotely sympathetic. The film does bring up, very obliquely, some nasty aspects of French history, but to absolutely no effect.

I stuck out the full two hours because the film does have a certain Gallic style, and I really wanted to find out what actually happened in the past (which seems to be the only point of the film).

I do understand that their cinematic styles are different than America's.  However, some styles are acceptable and some are just way over the line.  The story line was just too slow for my taste.  The videotapes (the ""spying"" parts) were too long with almost no action.  It was so quiet that I think viewers would jump out of their seats if a pin had dropped on the floor.

Basically, Georges and his wife and son are being videotaped outside of their home.  However, you'll soon learn that the focus is really Georges and his childhood.  Investigating to stop this harrassment, Georges contacts Majid, whose parents once worked for Georges' parents.

Director/screenwriter Michael Haneke's film frustrates many viewers with its inconclusive narrative.  I was fascinated by the theme of guilt: how it can bubble just under the surface of our lives, its destructive power, and the influence it can have on others, including the next generation.  I have come up with an explanation for events that satisfies me, and other viewers are invited to put together their own interpretations.  It is a tribute to the richness of the film that it can support varying analyses.

Another time the film makes a subtle highlight of Georges, serious topical-intellectual talk show host, in a film studio editing his own live interviews--he is literally re-writing history and applying power by manipulating information for his own purposes.

1206023,4,B00000F7E6,"I have an ongoing love affair with ambiguity in film. I actually love it if a film doesn't give me all of the answers and tie everything up in a neat and tidy bow, like so many formulaic Hollywood films do. ""Cache"", a sparse and creepy thriller, asks more questions than it provides answers, which, in my opinion, elevates it from being simply a movie to being art.

Georges and Anne Laurent are a busy, professional, self-absorbed couple with a pubescent son, who suddenly find themselves being stalked via a series of mysterious videotapes that show nothing but the ordinary scenery of their life, but are accompanied by disturbing and child-like drawings that are reminiscent of an event from Georges' childhood. The result is the revealing of much that is hidden (hence the title) in this family's life, both in the past and the present. It's creepy and unsettling, more so because the sparse direction and complete lack of a soundtrack force you to focus on the nuances of the characters, who are all full of contradictory motives and emotions.

One of the most interesting things about this film to me is how completely unsympathetic the main character, Georges, is. Rude, defensive and arrogant, he repeatedly lashes out at whoever is around him every time he feels threatened or on the verge of being exposed. The suspected ""villains"" of the film are all more sympathetic than the ""hero"".

After watching the film, I'd highly recommend watching the interview with the director in the special features. He doesn't really shed a lot of light on the questions his film poses, but it's fascinating nonetheless.",1194307200,,1614,4.904761904761905

Attention to nuance, irony, scene composition and the ability to accept dreams as dreams, memory as faulty and people as liars, even to themselves: you need these to enjoy this great film. If you want a staightforward thriller with a neat resolution... watch something else!

This film is a brilliant character study with political overtones. The vision is cynical and bleak. I found it unsettling and mulled it over in my mind for some time. There are so many themes, but most are implicit: imperialism, racism, bourgeois complacency, betrayal, family, trust, paranoia --these are but a few of the grand themes tackled by Haneke in less than 2 hours.

If you like a film that makes you work a bit and don't mind being disturbed, even shocked, then see Cach. The pacing is slow and deliberate, but not ""arty"". The dialogue is crisp and intelligent; the acting, flawless. The camera is manipulated like a surgeon's scalpel (which is as it had to be, given the main plot points) and the vibe is tense and paranoid.

1206080,5,B00000F7E6,"French film `Cache',' (`Hidden') by director Michael Heneke, is effective for many reasons.  Quietly, the movie creeps up on us and makes the tangible presence of surveillance unnerving in a convincing way.

At the beginning of the movie middle aged couple, George and Anne, are viewing a video in their Paris flat.  At first we don't see them; we only see the video and hear them as they watch and rewind or fast-forward the tape playing.  During the video they try to place the author who provides the footage filmed just outside their residence.  We soon discover the tapes are sent anonymously and dropped off in an antechamber to a gate protecting their place.  George, who is a celebrity host of a local television talk show, finds he is being stalked and sent puzzling videos wrapped with disturbing pictures.  In one of the drawings there is a child with a stream of blood flowing from him.  Although the pictures look like it was done by a child's hand, they (and we) believe otherwise.

Life goes on at its regular pace, and the movie's perfect timing makes us feel the repercussions of harassment as if it were our own.  After more disruptive deliveries, George finds another video.  This time the perpetrator has taken a trip to his childhood residence.  From here George has some clues, so he visits his mother who helps him sew together a past which starts to haunt him.  From there an additional video transports George to a mysterious residence.  With some simple legwork, George's investigation unfolds.  Understandably, they go to the police, but are told that something more significant must take place before they can intervene.  The manifestations even come into Georges' professional life when a strange videotape with George in it surfaces at work.  In the meantime, the couple's nerves are frayed, especially when the whereabouts of their 12-year-old son, Pierrot, comes into question.  As one character says to Georges, ""You have everything to lose.""

`Cache' works so well with the audience because it mostly gives us a first person seat to George's inner turmoil.  The mundane and extraordinary events mix so expertly, we are never in doubt about the state of affairs.  Past and present also surface skillfully as we see both ends meet in George's consciousness.  Social commentary is amply provided for without much articulation or artificial resonance.  (France, who also has immigration strife like the U.S., imports issues that, if neglected, can come to roost.)  Suspenseful and intriguing, 'Cache' should come out of hiding on everyone's movie list.  If you can't stand subtitles, you should set aside your reservations at least for this movie.

(In the DVD's extras, Director Michael Heneke gets right to the point of his creation.  Talking about more than method, he gives his own takes on the meaning of the story.  Loving ambiguity in his films, he, nevertheless, is concrete and clear with several points.  In the twenty-five minute interview, Heneke makes one of the most concise ""special features"" I've ever seen on DVD.)",1184630400,,3061,5.005940594059406
1206081,4,B00000F7E6,"This is an unusual, low-key thriller. A French family becomes aware that there is a video camera trained on their doorway 24-hours a day, watching their comings and goings. Tapes of this surveillance are sent to them, along with menacing drawings.

Then the surveillance becomes more ominous, more interior - anticipating where the father in the family will go and being in place before he arrives, ready to record what he does inside when he gets there.

There is a bit of a lapse in the logic of all this. It seems strange that the family can't locate where the camera was positioned. In fact, they don't even seem to try very hard to discover the hidden vantage point. But this is a minor quibble. Overall, this is an absorbing drama that will draw you into its subtle stalking.

There are long minutes when the viewer is turned into the camera lens. You are just silently pointed at that apartment building door yourself - watching, waiting. One of the distinctive features of this whole movie is that it has no background music. So there is an almost preternatural silence about its biding. The quiet street where this family's apartment is located - is almost too quiet. You will have a strange, passive, silent vigilance enforced on you during these minutes. This perspective contributes to building tension.

There's another reason to watch movies like this though, aside from being entertained by the mysterious uneasiness of it all. French thrillers that I've seen recently, such as this movie, ""Lemming,"" and ""La Moustache,"" all provide Americans with an intimate look into French family life. Like me, you might be struck by the relative formality of these middle class or professional families. Mealtimes seem to be especially different from the catch-as-catch-can affairs that American meals have become.  These French families sit down to well-prepared meals as focal occasions. There is usually no TV or radio playing in the background. There's not a lot of distraction of coming and going.

Maybe that's why the French don't get fat, despite their cream sauces and pastries. More of their time is spent concentrated onto precise pleasures. And that's what ""Cache"" itself provides - a precise and quiet pocket of enigma.",1183939200,,2236,4.981233243967829
1206082,4,B00000F7E6,"In Cache, director Michael Haneke creates a complex suspense film of grand psychological proportion where although mesmerized for over 90 minutes, the audience departs with a moody sense of perplexity that deeply disturbs and conjures in the mind more compelling post-9/11 possibilities than those originally thought feasible.

Does this film act as an allegory as some of the other reviewers have suggested of a modern day France dealing with the problems it created with the beurs, a generation of French-speaking and native born citizens who reflect by their language, racial and religious differences that they do not assimilate smoothly into the ""norm"" of French society?  October 17, 1961

If so, Daniel Auteuil plays the twisted journey of main character, Georges Laurent, with his usual distinguished brilliance. Like the symbolic Marianne, Georges and his wife Anne (Binoche) epitomize the typical upper middle class urbanites; both can impart savvy tidbits of informed conversation during a dinner party and as a respective talk show host and author, hold their own in terms of lifestyle and career.  As perfect as all this seems, when horrendous events are triggered and their routine world goes incredibly awry---videotapes and crayon drawings depicting the front faade of their building and scenes from Georges' childhood suggest that not only is the family under surveillance, the voyeur knows something unsavory about Georges' past---the couple is baffled into a state of stupefaction asking those familiar post-9/11 queries, `why us?' and `what did we do to deserve this?'

Georges' amateur detective work simultaneously uncovers his boyhood relationship with an Algerian child whose parents were killed by French police during the famous Paris Massacre of October 17, 1961 and exposes what could be a soft underbelly of French national guilt and defensiveness that acts as a metaphor for the confused social conscience directed towards millions of suspended-between-Algerian-and-French citizens who even after immigration and integration attempts at assimilation have been blamed for many of France's current problems.

On the other hand, perhaps Haneke's intent relies on controversies closer to home.  Pierrot, the Laurents' son, may be experiencing the hormones-raging rebellion typical of most adolescent and teens.  Wanting to rock his parents' established world, he may be perpetrating an elaborate practical joke that only he finds amusing.

Or Haneke may just be toying with the electron-charged atmosphere indigenous to most urban environments anticipating another third world sneak attack like 9/11.  Seeped in a backdrop of social and economic inequality, in the face of such focused hatred the so-called civilized world asks `why' while its third world victims cry out, `why not?'

Bottom line?  Cache boasts of fascinating performances in a plot that forever intrigues with its glimpses into the lives of a modern family threatened by either their own political guilt or the quintessential morph from boy to man utilizing a technological reign of terror that plays on a defensive social conscience.  Recommended to those who do not expect answers.

1206084,5,B00000F7E6,"Cache is a film, that right off the bat you understand isn't going to be like all the others.  First off, it begins with a still camera focusing on a house while nothing particularly important goes on.  One soon finds off that the well off family of main characters is being harassed with mysterious video tapes and postcards, but with no real idea on who is sending them.  Slowly as things start to unravel, one gathers more and more questions about, well basicly everything in the movie.  This will be enjoyed by most film buffs who don't mind not having anwsers spoon fed to them.  The plot gets better as you start to see the characters secrets come to life.  Cache keeps a atomsphere all to itself as well, the film does not rush itself, and also lacks a score which is a brillently vital way to keep suspence to those who can pay attention without it.  The moments of shock that come in a largely suspence building movie are heightened I would say actually in the movie, because we are so use to scores as psychological clues in film, we almost feel lost without them.

One reviewer said that ""personal guilt"" is overplayed.  The odd thing about that is that guilt is the main theme of the entire film, so i'm far from agreement about that.  The film as a whole is about exploring not just personal guilt, but the guilt of a society as well.  The director has a fairly well thought out interview in the dvd as well, that is recommended viewing as it gives very clear thoughts on what the director wanted.

1206137,4,B00000F7E6,"Strange how, in 90-odd reviews, this film has provoked such a variety of responses, from a kind of reverential respect to downright anger.  From US (re)viewers, generally, there is continual reference to 'arthouse' movies, and often to French offerings in particular, as 'pretentious'.  This is a distinction that died long ago in Europe, though as an Englishman in his mid sixties I can recall the term 'continental cinema' being used often enough to suggest the same kind of genre, (often with a bit of nudity thrown in.)

'Hidden' is a fascinating and often masterly piece of film-making, beautifully acted, slowly paced, to be sure, but working at many levels and utterly intriguing throughout. I, like many others, was shocked by the brief scenes of Majid's suicide and the slaughter of the rooster, but shocked even more to find that the static wide shot of the school exterior at the end was in fact the final shot of the film and that I was to be told no more!

This didn't make me angry, as it seems to have done so many reviewers, - on the contrary, the compelling nature of everything that had preceded this had already created sufficient respect for the director for me to gently 'close the book', as it were, close my eyes and start thinking!

I don't actually know anyone that I would recommend the film to, but that's because 'Hidden' is one of those films that engenders a reaction based on our own prejudices and our own degree of receptivity.

As for 'watching paint dry', a phrase that has cropped up several times in previous reviews, if Daniel Auteuil did the painting, I'll happily watch it dry!

1206142,4,B00000F7E6,"To what extent are you responsible for something you did when you were six years old?

This is the central question of this strange thriller from French shock meister Michael Haneke.  Another question is, How crazy do you have to be to seek revenge for something done to you by a child when you were a child?

Haneke, like the playwrights of an earlier generation, begins the movie by boring his captive audience (although with DVDs we aren't so captive) so as to make the excitement to come seem by contrast even more exciting.  Hunger is the best cook, one might say.  He even goes so far as to show us the back of Juliette Binoche's head for a few minutes before we see her face.  I'm not enamored of such ""techniques,"" but what I really don't like about Haneke is the excessive blood-spilling he is so fond of.  Here he is actually (for him) in remarkable control.

This movie is about guilt, the guilt the privileged feel toward those who haven't had the same opportunities and the same advantages that they have had.  It is about the French national guilt about the Algerian war that still lingers and is being rehashed because of recent events.  Daniel Auteuil, he of the kind face and most noticeable proboscis, plays with his usual skill Georges Laurent, an intellectual who hosts a book-chat show on TV.  Binoche is his wife, Anne.  They begin to get videos, long boring shots of their residence, wrapped in child-like drawings in charcoal and red.  Eventually in one of the videos Georges's childhood home is pictured leading him to believe he has figured out who is watching them threateningly and why.  But he won't tell Anne because he says he isn't sure.  There is a nice scene in which she demonstrates that not being sure is not a good enough reason since this is happening to her too!  But the real reason he will not tell her his suspicions is because he doesn't want to reveal something bad that he had done as a child.

Another nice scene is when he visits his mother, played with great subtlety by Annie Girardot, who reads him like a book and only frowns when she sees that he is lying to her.

Most of the movie is characterized by excellent work by the actors and realistic dialogue in a contemporary French milieu, emphasizing the contrast between today's French haves and have nots, between the elegant suburban home of the Laurent's and the simple apartment of the Algerian Majid (Maurice Benichou) from Georges's childhood.

The movie begins very slowly, but stay with it.  Once it gets rolling it is very good.  One other thing: the question about their very pretty 12-year-old son Pierrot Laurent (Lester Makedonsky) and his seeming disdain for his parents will not make sense until the final framing scene in which we watch the credits roll down the screen in front of a set shot of Pierrot's school letting out.

1206143,5,B00000F7E6,"I think it was one of the best movies of 2005 that deservingly won the Cannes Best Director Award. It is one of the most mysterious films I've ever seen that looks like a thriller but it is not, it is much more interesting, dramatic, and deeper.

Haneke's camera fixes on a successful French couple, Georges and Anne and uncovers (at the same time leaving a lot hidden) a lot about them, about what it means to live a life with the feeling of never ending guilt that would always stays in the memory no matter how hard one tries to hide it.

Georges and Anne begin receiving strange videotapes with the footage of their house, disturbing cards, and phone calls. Georges's memory and guilty conscience about some events that took place when he was 6-year-old child let him realize who might be behind the tapes but he hesitates to tell Anne because the story is complex. She is furious at him for lack of trust even though there are some secrets in her life as well.

Dreams and flashbacks of Georges' childhood reveal the mystery that goes as far as not only examining the jealousy of a young boy to another boy, a stranger from different culture and backgrounds with whom he had to share love and attention of his parents but also controversial racial and political relations between two countries that have not improved by now and would they ever improve as the new generations grow up remains one of the many questions that this uncompromising masterful film brings up but would not and could not answer.

I've watched the enigmatic film over and over during the weekend and I am fascinated by Haneke's craft, by his subtlety, by his ability to say something new in a very original way about subjects that are anything but new.

Outstanding film-making at its best.",1176249600,3,1768,4.617834394904459

These films seem to represent the worldview of a thoroughly cynical and depressed director. Some reviewers found the first 45 minutes intriguing. Why? It had all the entertainment value of CCTV footage in an empty car park. Haneke's comment about wanting to leave the ending ambiguous is staggering. The film doesn't have an ambiguous ending, it has NO ending. Leaving the film like this was the only way to inject any mystery at all into the turgid, unpleasant and thoroughly boring spectacle of the preceding 109 mins. All the characters are horrible. They are grey, in grey surroundings, leading lives with all the variety, charm and spontaneity that shades of grey can evoke. Mr Haneke has achieved in two consecutive films the seemingly impossible feat of draining Juliette Binoche of all her beauty, charisma and radiance. There is not an ounce of humour to be found. If there is any laughter in Haneke's world it must come when he receives his bank statements and reflects on the gullibility of people who fawn over this rubbish.",1173052800,10,1145,4.96875

A lot of other reviewers have mentioned the excellent parts of this movie better than I ever could.  In the special features, the director says the movie talks about guilt, which many people have reiterated here.  But I got more from it than that.  It's about film.  It's about manipulation.  Honestly, once the movie ended and I got over the initial shock/disappointment of the ending, I realized that the mystery isn't really that important (in my opinion, of course).  The mystery is a device to discuss other things, such as manipulation.  How film can be used to manipulate ideas/actions because it seems to mirror reality, but it isn't reality.  It is video, video that can be cut, edited and distributed to sell an idea.

I could go on and on, but I feel that, if you view this movie as a shallow thriller, you will more than likely not like it.

The style of this film is not anything like the styles you will find in American films, but that is what makes this film such a classically typical French film.  The ending is very open-ended, leaving you wondering and even imagining what happens to the main character Georges, played by Daniel Auteuil.  French films tyically don't have real resolutions to conflict in their endings, that's what makes them so hard to be appreciated by an American audience.

For a much better primer on Haneke's worldview, better to rent his earlier, less-seen films like BENNY'S VIDEO and FUNNY GAMES, which are dark, nasty, detached, and completely absorbing in a way that, alas, the bigger-budget CACHE isn't - Haneke clearly has his own obsessions, and they are all combined here, but he did it better before, and to much more thrilling effect.",1168819200,3,707,4.80327868852459

2. You don't even care about the characters.

3. Ripoff of ""8MM""

4. No music

6. Too many plotholes (the Algerian guy committing suicide, which DID make me jump, but was pointless)

Accordingly, a lot of people who appreciate some or all of those things might dismiss the negative reviews.  I dig all of the above, but I think critics have lavishly overpraised Cache.  The political subtext is too near the surface to tell us anything beyond Georges' brief but welcome account of the actual Oct. 17 massacre.  The characters are underdeveloped, and their relationship therefore isn't engaging; I don't get how anyone who has seen ""Knife in the Water"" or, hell, ""Dead Calm"" can consider this a great psychological thriller.  The oft-repeated notion that the film delivers ""gasps"" is laughable.  For good or ill, that isn't remotely this film's game.  I like the creepy evocation of voyeurism, especially in the film's gradual blurring of lines between its own narrative and the videotapes, but by the time the last scene dropped the big ""Huh?,"" nothing about the story, themes, or emotional texture of Cache made me care to ponder for more than a few seconds what the hell had happened.

1206289,5,B00000F7E6,"Michael Haneke is a director whose work is hard to like because of his habitually difficult style and harsh chosen subject matter. But this time with ""Cache"" he has made a masterful, nearly-mainstream thriller/mystery that will have you squirming in your seat even as you don't dare look away. Daniel Auteuil, the always adorable Juliette Binoche, and their young son live a very fortunate life in Paris until someone begins bombarding them with intrusive, shocking videotapes, mail, and phone calls.  It soon becomes apparent that Auteuil is hiding a secret from his past that is threatening to tear their formerly charmed lives apart.

I actively disliked two of Haneke's previous films, the grueling ""The Piano Teacher"" and the sadistic ""Funny Games"" even as I admired the skill with which he made them.  With ""Cache"" he seems to want to emulate more conventional, commercial movies (specifically Hitchcock), and it makes the film more absorbing and entertaining.  It is certainly a more accessible film than usual for him, although it is another one of his dark, pessimistic fables about human guilt.  The plot is intricately structured so you have to pay attention.  Even so, you get the feeling than Haneke's is only revealing some parts of the story and you, the viewer, will have to continue to tease out of the film after it ends what Haneke merely implies.  (What is the true nature of the relationship between Binoche and her friend Pierre, for example?  And why does it so upset Binoche's son?)  If I'm not mistaken Haneke is also paying tribute to David Lynch, specifically the surveillance tapes of ""Lost Highway"" and the character's name of ""Laurent.""  Plus the film positively reeks of Lynch's paranoia, rotting apartments, sudden eruption of disturbing encounters, and all-around general terror.

Haneke turns the screws, as he likes to do, and the tension in ""Cache"" gets high indeed.  And, yes, there is one scene in particular (at least) that will catch you off guard and send chills down your spine.  There is also the already famous last shot that will have some viewers scratching their heads in befuddlement.  In an interview on the ""Special Features"" part of the DVD, Haneke explains the action of what happens, although he won't say what it means.  There are several possible interpretations, although it seems to me all of them are incredibly ominous and mean that the story is far from over even if the movie is.

I apppreciated Michael Haneke's Funny Games and was interested to see what curveball he could throw at us this time.

Well what i can say is that for nearly all of this films running time we are treated to suspense, mystery and some genuine end of the seat type thrills.  All the actors are fine and do the script justice however the films premise of a family being videotaped by a stranger whom leaves the packages for them to see is nothing new and somewhat of a rip off of the ideas explored in parts of David Lynch's Lost Highway.  However where this film dies is in the last few minutes of the film.  Upon having tantalising clues and scenarios thrown at us for the entirety of the film as to the meaning and mystery of it all we are presented with a static shot of what i presume to be a school. For several agonising minutes where people just come and go without any relevance or meaning to what has happened the credits suddenly roll and the whole show is over with absolutely no explanation of what you have just seen.  I am a fan of works with abstract or obsquire endings (such as Mulholland Drive) however this piece of final act lunacy went beyond the realms of what i consider acceptable.  Instead of being left intruiged or satisfied with a fine cinema experience the viewer is left feeling like several hours of their life has been wasted and burdened with a great sense of being cheated.  Why have a film with no discernable ending? I am so sick of people mulling over and praising crap like this because it is the ""in"" thing to do.  I don't care what anyone says, this is the worst ending i have ever witnessed (and i have watched thousands of films of all genres), so bad as to tarnish the great film which preceeded it.

Dear God, what a boring, montonous mess: Long, static shots of a townhouse that last minutes at a time; ambiguity and a frustratingly cryptic plot make this a very hard film to sit through. I don't need a movie to hold my hand and hit me over the head with answers, but for the love of God, reveal something interesting! The excruciating glacial pace makes Antonioni look like Michael Bay. Coffee was no cure; neither was a bag of chips. Sleep overcame me despite my greatest desire to watch and pay close attention to this movie.

The ""startling moment"" everyone describes is when one character slices his own throat, spraying blood everywhere. This scene is almost incongruous, since it is quick, violent, and horrifying, unlike the rest of the movie.

I have watched hundreds of foreign movies, and have liked most of them. However, CACHE is one of the worst I've seen. No resolution, no answers, incomprehensible, no likeable characters, impossibly slow. I want to know why the main character was getting those videos sent to him.

I almost want to slash MY own throat for watching this self-indulgent exercise.

 I call it a masterpiece because CACHE is a work of art that takes you way beyond its surface into a state of mind that amplifies and illuminates its nominal subject.  I'm  reminded of a very different masterpiece--Pedro Almodovar's TALK TO HER--which luminously carries you into a state of love.

 CACHE has the power to transport you into the web of human social connection. A sticky web, not easily seen, not easily extracted from.

 In a phase, the film is about guilt and self-produced moral blindness across the various networks/divides of our socially extended selves (generations and social strata, and, to a lesser extent, gender).  Very disturbing to see/feel how we avoid responsibility for the unavoidable damage we as individuals do ""in all innocence"" to ""others"" in a stratified society.  The film--by forcing us to decide how guilty (responsible) can a six year-old be-- puts the blood in our face, and we can watch our own internal struggle with historical awareness claw past the complex processes of rationalization that keep us blind to our connection to one-another.

1206364,2,B00000F7E6,"There's a few things to like about this film and quite a few to dislike. Cache (in French) means ""hidden"", and it's an apt analogy on multiple levels. But the levels collapse under their own dramatic weight, leaving the viewer scratching their heads more than pondering the movie's significance.

The story focuses on husband and wife Georges (Daniel Auteuil) and Ann (Juliette Binoche, CHOCOLAT), a happily married couple who's lives are about to unwind. In front of their home, they find a videotape. The tape shows a fairly stagnant view of the front of their home; their comings and goings. But it's also a bit unnerving. Who would shoot this film and why?

Eventually more tapes show up on their doorstep, only now they're wrapped in paper on which is drawn -- childlike -- very disturbing caricatures of a face with blood shooting out of its mouth. Georges begins to feel that some of this may be linked to his past, but keeps it hidden from his wife, thus causing a rift to develop.

We occasionally flashback to Georges childhood when he was six. Here we learn that a young Algerian boy and his family were once a part of Georges and his parents' lives. But tragedy struck the Algerian boy's parents and Georges, somewhat of a spoiled brat, ruins what's left of the Algerian boy's young life.

More tapes show up and Georges is led to a now full-grown Algerian man's home, the same man whom Georges helped evict from his life. Guilt settles in heavily for Georges and we watch him being torn apart by childhood memories long forgotten.

The story sounds more appealing than it is. It certainly got my attention when I read about it. But watching it is pretty tough. The pacing is agonizingly slow, showing slow passing cars, minutes upon minutes of mundane material, and a plot that seems to lead nowhere. Initially I thought this might be some sort of murder mystery or psychological thriller. But no. It's all about childhood guilt and how one man deals with it later on in life. I actually didn't even understand it was about guilt until I watched the extra features on the DVD just to find out what the hell was supposed to be going on; I think that says a lot about how far afield the story strayed (I consider myself a fairly astute viewer).

The good parts of the film are its innate quirks. Sometimes you're watching the movie and you aren't sure if its part of the movie or part of a videotape within the movie. That was kinda cool. The dark scenes in the bedroom as Georges and Ann come to terms with what Georges did to the Algerian boy are filmed extremely well, too. That acting is also well done and never forced, adding a bit or emotional heft to a rather bland telling. But that's as far as the ""good"" goes.

1206366,3,B00000F7E6,"Around the time I heard about the french film L'Enfant(the Child), I heard about this film called Cache(Hidden) which people praised in its Hitchcockness of the plot. Well, in watching it, I was quite disappointed in it; not that the movie was terrible, but that it could've been so much more than what was presented. If you're curious about it, I'd recommend it but don't believe the hype this got.

After what is probably the most squint-inducing opening credits I've ever seen, we find out Georges and his wife Anne are receiving weird videotapes with their house being filmed. They figure since Georges is a talk show host that it's probably some obsessed fan. Pretty soon, there's a videotape showing Georges childhood home and some kid drawings that are kind of disturbing. So who sent them and what exactly do they want, and more importantly: how much is Georges and Anna sticking together through it?

Sometimes I find there's 2 kinds of filmmakers when it deals with plot: those who spell everything out and explain every detail and plot twist while the second seems content to let us figure it out and make us draw our own conclusions. While I don't like being spoonfed, at least I like things there so that way I go ""d'oh! how could I have missed that? it's so obvious"" but with this film it just kind of 'is' without giving anything to go on. It's one of those kind of films where you literally have to research on the net what happened unlike let's say Sixth Sense where if you watch the second time, you notice those little details that support the ending/story.

Of course any film like this needs likable characters and in a way, Georges and Anna...aren't. While Juliette Binoche is an attractive woman, her character comes across as too *****y and a bit antagonizing while Georges is just unlikable, even when he is nice. It's not a fault of the actors but when you have some kind of stalker sending you disturbing videos and drawings, you at least wanna have sympathy and here I felt none.

Ultimately what does make the film interesting is its story and the mystery surrounding who exactly is sending the tapes. It's like a Hitchcock mystery in that way and it makes the ambigious final shot all the more disappointing cause it says so much yet thinking it through, answers so little. So are they the people behind it or not? Or is one the guy and threatening the other? There's no microphone so we don't know.

I don't know if I should recommend it. Story's interesting and there's enough intrigue but the way it's handled and the unlikable characters makes it a tough sell.",1156982400,2,2594,4.642701525054466
1206367,5,B00000F7E6,"For some years Michael Haneke has been picking apart the petty and hypocritical concerns of a colourless and characterless bourgeois society, but with ""Hidden he fearlessly takes on one of French society's darkest days, namely the drowning of several hundred Algerians in the Seine in the early 60's. This event provides the bedrock for a film that works on a number of levels, and explores some universal truths about the human condition and its propensity for deceit and betrayal. The intricate layers of deception and trickery that plague the middle class suburban couple (played wonderfully by Daniel Auteuil and the faultless Juliette Binoche) are peeled away to reveal a seething mass of hidden and buried prejudices, which seem to worryingly translate to the next generation. The impetus of this breakdown in familial institution is brought about by a series of mysterious and unnerving videocassettes, which show the families house under surveillance. The film which has been very unconventional up to this point (consisting of very long, static, medium shots) takes on the form of a detective thriller as Georges attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery of the tapes. In a society dominated by surveillance of all forms, Haneke suggests that not even the deepest and most painful secrets can be hidden from a voyeuristic and intrusive society.  Haneke creates an incredible tension with his static camera and infrequent editing. But Haneke consistently infuriates generic delineation, and regularly crosses boundaries, so that ""Hidden"" becomes something peculiarly unique in tone. There is an objective iciness about the proceedings which offers no answers to a problem that has plagued mankind since time immemorial; the nature and quality of truth.",1156982400,,1763,5.318996415770609

1206423,3,B00000F7E6,"Cache is definitely a critic's movie, as well as one for lovers of European art films. It is full of political statements, symbolism and ambiguity. Mainstream  audiences are likely to find it slow-paced and will probably not appreciate the unresolved ending. While I don't consider myself part of the mainstream audience, I have to confess to having some impatience with the film on these counts.

As a rule, I don't appreciate movies that importantly preach to the audience that ""the personal is political,"" and that, I think, is the real point of Cache. George and Anne Laurent (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) are a couple who are receiving harassing videos from an unknown stalker. The videos are simply footage of their home and everyday activities, and are quite unnerving. The premise is great for a suspense thriller, but as the movie wears on, we eventually realize that the videos are only what the movie seems to be about. Director Michael Haneke, in the post-film interview that comes with the DVD, admits that it isn't even important who sent the videos.  What develops instead is a conflict between George and Majid, an Algerian man who lived with George's family when he was a young child, just before a massacre of Algerians by the French government. While the film doesn't go into a great deal of detail about this event, it is clearly identifying George and Majid as representatives of a broader historical and cultural conflict. So when the issue of guilt comes up for George, involving a childhood incident with Majid, we know that we are supposed to be thinking not only of these characters, but of issues such as European colonialism and racism.

Cache is always interesting enough to keep your attention. It has a couple of truly disturbing scenes. The characters never turn into mere stereotypes, which is something of an accomplishment considering the Big Statement, or at least Big Questions Haneke is putting in front of us. The politics and melodrama end up pushing the suspense into the background. I suppose to consider this a great film, you have to buy into the grandiose idea that vast historical dramas play themselves out in the lives of ordinary people. Perhaps this is true at times. As it pertains to the characters in Cache, I was only partly convinced.",1155600000,4,2297,4.897172236503856

[Remember the dinner-time discussion about the director friend?  No one knew what he was up to these days.  ""Some unnamed project.""]  Anyway, according to the cineistas on IMDB (a heady crew), this take on things would not be out of line with Haneke's previous body of work.

I too watched the film expecting ""merely"" a good thriller. I, however, was captivated by the slow long shots and the building tension. Like many, I initally found the ending sudden, unsatisfying, and unsettling. What! It's over now?!? But knowing that the film was highly acclaimed led me to immediately question that reaction. I scanned backwards and watched the final 5 minutes or so several times. I also THOUGHT about what I had seen, carefully. I went to bed convinced that I had seen a very good, possibly great film, but not sure that I had understood it yet. The next morning I couldn't stop thinking about the film. That is one definition of a great film.

Rather than complain about the way the movie was put together, one could decide to investigate why it is done that way, why so many others speak of this as an amazing film. For example, one reviewer below claims that the wife character (Juliette Binoche) is ""not guilty of anything"". I wouldn'tnecessarily say that. The film suggests very strongly that she is, or at least could be. Why does the son accuse her of having an affair? Where did he get that idea, and does it have anything to do with who he meets in the final shot? There is much much more going on in this film then the negative reviewers have bothered to see. This is the sort of movie that whole books will be written about, the kind of film studied shot by shot in university classes. The film is simultaneously about national/international politics, racism, marriage, and the socio-psychology of trust, guilt, and denial at many levels.

It's true that there are no easy ""solutions"" to the mystery, and that's part of the point of the film. And of course that is also often the case for Hitchcock (e.g. The Birds). If you are looking for a more conventional mystery with neatly explained ""answers"" then this is not for you, but if you are looking for an inellectual adventure that will move you subtly, deeply this is a good choice.

Starting with a summary, I will say that this is an excellent film with marvelous direction by M. Haneke and very good acting by Auteuil and especially Binoche.

Granted, it is not for the faint-hearted through both its stark imagery and disturbing story line.

But it is as true as few things, in its dealings with racism, petty feelings, hypocricy, modern society and numerous other issues and themes.

Every aspect of the film is carefully thought out, with excellent choices in photography and scenography as well.

I must praise once again superb acting from Binoche, who seems to be 'living' her part, and incisive directing by Haneke, who chooses to leave some things unsaid, is ambiguous when needed, points out irony, unravels the storyline in a timely fashion and in all delivers a masterclass in directing.

I won't dwell on the story, as I am sure it has been adequately covered, but will only say that the film's title is quite indicative of one of the main themes of this excellent film.",1153612800,5,1095,4.7368421052631575
1206492,4,B00000F7E6,"Many reviewers refer to `Hidden' as thriller, or something like thriller. I can understand why the term should be used to describe the nature of this strangely attractive film - you see, the film opens with a mysterious video tape that suggests the presence of a stalker taping the life of an ordinary family. But perhaps you can also see Michael Haneke's film as modern-day fable about the fragile nature of our daily life, of which comfortable peacefulness is just as skin-deep as possible, as the happily married couple (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) would find themselves.

As I said, the film starts with a video that taped the house of one Georges Laurent, popular host of TV program. Someone has left it at the front door of his house and keeps sending the tapes without leaving any message.

The second and third tapes are more curious because one of them is about an old house where Georges had been living as a boy. The other video is even stranger because the images seem to be inviting Georges to go to one particular room where he had never been to.

The film is not so much about the identity of the sender as about the life of Georges that begins to undergo a drastic change. The film's premise that deals with the concept of paranoia might remind you of Coppola's `The Conversations,' but Haneke's film is unique in suggesting the political relations between France and Algeria, and his idea about belonging to the middle-class in France or Europe. The casting of Daniel Auteuil is actually a very clever one for he is really born in Algeria, which gives a credible tone to the film together with his good acting.

[WARNING!!] Two things must be said about the film. One is that it includes some unnerving images like the beheading of a rooster. Though the film avoids showing them directly on the screen, they may be shocking to some viewers.

The other is about the film's last shot, where Haneke (literally) has hidden a clue or clues as to what happened in the film. Actually, it is just a clue that might be interpreted in more than one way, not a definite answer as some of the reviewers think. Probably some of you might not notice THEM there, but Haneke thinks it is still OK even if you fail to notice.

The complaint about the pretentiousness of the film should be justified to some extent, and you may say not many people would play the video tape with your VCR when sent from a stranger. Juliette Binoche's role also needs more improvement for it does not show anything new except the typical image of suffering wife.

1206493,5,B00000F7E6,"(This comment may contain spoilers)

I wasn't prepared for how powerful Cach turned out to be: it's been a long time since I've heard an entire cinema gap in genuine shock at one sequence. On the surface it's a fairly typical French film, but it's what's under the surface that really counts. That said, it's still a film that many dismiss as empty or dilettante filmmaking, either because it's more concerned with the fallout its mystery provokes than offering a solution or because it's just trendy liberalism. It's certainly not for all tastes.

The central premise is simple enough, as Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche's comfortable bourgeois life is put under increasing strain by a series of videotapes of the their house accompanied by childish drawings of bleeding faces. The tapes show nothing: their menace comes not from their contents but the fact that they exist. Since the drawings have to come from someone who knows the character's past, is it Auteuil's Georges' own conscience that is sending them? Or is it the filmmaker himself to provoke a reaction from his characters? Significantly the tapes are all shot on a fixed camera mounted on a raised tripod in what must be a clearly visible position. The appearance of the second tape blocking a doorway that was clear earlier in the shot offers little else in the way of a possible natural explanation.

But the tapes are really just a Maguffin, a narrative device to push the characters and plot forward. This particular lost highway leads into the past, and France's inability to apologise for it's colonial past (specifically Algeria), something it absolves itself of all guilt from by repeating the mantra that it was all in the past when they were much younger and knew no better, as if that wipes out thousands of futures denied or stolen. It's no accident that the film revolves around a failed adoption that mirrors France's own failed colonisations.

While the characters are believable rather than Godardian or art-house archetypes, it's easy to ascribe a wider allegorical purpose to them. Georges is a reflection of France itself, outwardly respectable but denying his past and not acknowledging guilt over Algeria (significantly, Auteuil was born there). He simply doesn't want to talk about it. He doesn't even connect emotionally with his present, let alone his past, mother, son and wife all a part of his life he really has nothing much to say about. Nothing is ever Georges' fault, not even a near accident crossing the street. He blames a cyclist for his careless mistake, showing that he has learned nothing from his past but is still repeating it. As with the opening of Haneke's epic of non-communication, Code Unknown, he is oblivious to the wider implications of what is to him a trivial moment or of the possible consequences of his moment of self-righteous anger.

Just as he edits out anything 'too theoretical' in his TV show, he tries to re-edit his own past (just as the French government did last year when it passed a law that ""the benefits of French colonisation in foreign countries should be recognised and integrated into school programs."") but can't do it quite so easily. Not that he doesn't try. Both of Georges' initial flashbacks are dishonest reinventions of memory: Georges turns his childish conspiracy against one character into his victim terrorising him, reinventing his memory and history to reflect his current interpretation of events and reality. It's this reinvention that allows him to honestly claim without any real evidence that he is being terrorised - ""a campaign of terror"" are his exact words - by the person he has wronged, actions currently being replayed in Iraq. To France, the atrocities inflicted on the Algerians don't matter - it's the threat to Georges that, in his childlike ignorance, is all that matters and must be dealt with radically.

Indeed, even though Majid and his son are French-born, both are regarded as foreigners, intruders. Yet neither conforms to the stereotyped 'Arab' image: polite, sad, very pointedly not aggressive, yet still regarded purely as a threat for being goaded into an action for which they were punished.

Binoche can be seen as the French people, kept in the dark, asked for their trust although trust is not extended to them in much the same way that Blair in the UK asked for people's trust over the intelligence that led to the UK's involvement in Iraq yet never revealed nor explained his reasons beyond his contention that he was convinced it was ""the right thing to do, but it's time to move forward."" But if Binoche is the French people, she is no more admirable herself. Both ignore the violence and torture that plays unwatched on a TV in the background in one scene and concentrate on their own immediate priorities.

I still haven't had time to fully digest all the implications of the ending - is he committing suicide himself? (Probably not since he feels no guilt.) Is the hidden shot of two children talking to each other in the final shot a sign of complicity or the way that each generation is doomed to suffer for the sins of the father? Is it the next tape to be sent? It's almost a Rorschach Test for the viewer: how you interpret it says more about you than the film.

Haneke makes no secret that he isn't interested in providing answers but rather is forcing questions on the viewer to make them more of a participant: ""I'm not going to give anyone the answer. If you think it's Majid, Pierrot, Georges, the malevolent director, God himself, the human conscience - all these answers are correct. But if you come out wanting to know who sent the tapes, you didn't understand the film. To ask this question is to avoid asking the real question the film raises, which is more: how do we treat our conscience and our guilt and reconcile ourselves to living with our actions... I look at it as productive frustration. Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think.""",1153267200,15,6041,4.84027105517909

1206495,4,B00000F7E6,"""Cache (Hidden)"", a new French film, does a very sly thing. This very good, very engrossing film received a limited theatrical release earlier this year and has just been released on DVD. I highly recommend it.

George (Daniel Auteil, ""Apres Vous"") and Anne (Juliette Binoche, ""The English Patient"", ""Bee Season""), a French couple with a 12 year old son, Pierrot, are disturbed when they receive an anonymous videocassette showing the exterior of their home. Nothing else is on the tape, just two hours of the front of their house, showing an occasional car drive or pedestrian walk down the quiet residential street. Soon, another tape arrives wrapped in a child-like drawing showing a boy bleeding from his mouth. The tape shows the same thing, two hours of surveillance. As the tapes continue to arrive, the setting changes, but it is always something to do with them, someplace or event they are associated with, and the couple becomes more frazzled. They try to figure out who might be at the center of this conspiracy and try to get the police to help. When that proves ineffective, they begin to follow leads of their own. As the tapes and the drawings continue, George begins to have memories of a traumatic event in his childhood. But who is sending the tapes? And why?

Directed by Michael Hanneke, ""Cache"" is a surprisingly effective film. Surprising because it manages to draw us in to the story so completely.

The film opens with the shot of the couple's home. For a few minutes, the camera just sits recording, watching, and showing us what the person is seeing as they make the videotape. Soon, we hear George and Anne talking off-screen, discussing the situation. Suddenly, the unmistakable signs of a videotape being rewound interrupt the image. We have been watching the tape the couple is watching! We have been sharing their point of view. Using this forced perspective, the director has done two things. He is telling us we can't really trust everything we see and he is also forcing us to see the world through the eyes of George and Anne. As we watch the film through their eyes, we also understand they are unable to trust everything they see, adding to the confusion. It is a brilliant method of bringing us into their world.

Throughout the film, Hanneke takes his time; very few camera moves, very few edits and no background music make us an eavesdropper. Virtually every scene seems to last ages, five minutes or more, but that helps us become a part of their world. This may not seem like a long time, but in today's cinema, it is an eternity.  The director is making us both an eavesdropper and a participant. We are usually placed in the same position as the videographer, or if the couple is having a discussion, we frequently take the place of one of them, watching their partner throughout the interaction. We are always watching, making us complicit in the crime, if a crime in fact occurred.

I don't want you to get the impression that ""Cache"" is only good because of this narrative technique. At the heart of the film are two great performances from Auteil and Binoche. Auteil plays George, a television personality currently hosting a popular show featuring a roundtable of authors discussing their new books. If you needed any confirmation this film isn't set in the U.S., look no further. He and Anne have been together a long time and it shows. There are no romantic fireworks, but when this situation develops, they work together because they love each other; they are a team, a couple.

At one point, they consider maybe they are being stalked, because of his celebrity status. We watch as he hosts a little of his show, he meets with his agent to discuss the status of his new project and more. But the drawings bring back childhood memories and he changes focus.

Binoche is, as always, great. Her portrayal of Anne, a book publisher, is excellent. In one particularly good scene, she has a fight with her husband because he went to talk to someone else about a key point in the mystery, preferring not to bother her; he didn't have an affair, he didn't kill anyone, he didn't rob someone at gunpoint, he merely confided in someone else. Because they have been together for years, she feels hurt that he couldn't confide in her. It is an effective method of showing how long they have been together, the state of their relationship, their maturity.

As they work through the various scenarios, we see them interact with friends, their son, co-workers. All of this helps these characters seem real; like we are watching two people live their lives, like we are eavesdropping or complicit in the crime. If in fact one occurred.

""Cache"" also contains a scene which shocked me. This isn't easy to do, because I have seen hundreds of films and very little is new or unexpected. But this scene caught me off guard; it is completely unexpected and depicted in such a way I was surprised. The scene is all the more effective because it fits and also deepens the mystery. It isn't a red herring included merely for the sake of including it.

The DVD contains a lengthy interview with the director and a long making-of documentary, both of which are over 30 minutes long. I watched a few minutes of each and then turned them off; I didn't want to have any of the film's secrets ruined. Even after watching the film, I didn't know or understand everything that happened and I was afraid one of these supplements would ruin some of the mystery. I didn't want to hear even their interpretation of what really happened.

I have my own interpretation. And I'll keep it hidden.",1152662400,5,5610,4.70162932790224

With the recording is nothing but an unedited running of their home, it does however contain a certain feeling of depression that someone is watching them. As the story builds up the family continue to receive these annonymous video tapes, but now with something else. A series of violent child-like images. These video tapes and images lead to more questions and further into the plot, that really provides us with an interesting story keeping the viewer on the screen, with clever and original film making. With music excluded entirely from the film, making the events and scenery all more effective and atmospheric than your average, car chasing, thrillers but more of a thriller for the artistic mind.

But even though this stylish and original thriller, begins with questions and answers that lead to a clever and unpredictable mystery, it ends with a very sudden conclusion that leaves the viewers unanswered and feeling unrewarded for Hiddens mistakes.",1152316800,6,1511,4.875486381322958

After seeing ''The Widow of Saint-Pierre''  I wished someone would make another movie with Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche.  Well someone did but shouldn't have.  The relationship between the two caracters does not, as mentionned elswhere, deteriorate ; it is rotten from the start and just stays that way, everything in this movie just ''stays that way'' save for a sensationnalist scene which is poorly brought about and which I will not describe should you choose to put yourself through the ordeal of watching this pseudo-intellectual, amateurish flic.  I did not find Daniel Auteuil's acting up to his usual standards, not very convincing, perhaps he was also bored...Juliette Binoche had it easy, she just kept that blaz&eacute; expression through the entire movie...Maybe she was bored too.  This director should certainly not be compared to Bergman, Hitchcock or Antonioni.

1206498,4,B00000F7E6,"As a boy of 6 Georges Laurent (Daniel Auteil) was responsible for what some might consider to be an atrotious crime: he lied about something and the result was that another boy's life was changed forever. Arguably you cannot hold a six-year-old responsible for the fate of another child and yet what is fascinating is that even when Georges Laurent has reached middle-age he still refuses to acknowledge anything like remorse or regret. His way of dealing with his own demons is to withdrawal into himself, to sleep, but even that is no escape for the past still presses in on him through recurring dreams.

As far as we know Georges has been having these dreams even before the videos start arriving and he may have been having them his entire life. This may explain why as a middle-aged man Georges is bitter and suffers from an inability to connect to others. Instead of connecting to other people he isolates himself behind a wall of books and videos (every wall in his house is lined with books and/ or videos). It would seem Georges prefers the impersonality of books and films to people.  Thus it is fitting that he should be a host of a television book chat show for on the show he simply asks a set of formulaic questions, and he can control the content (as well as his own persona) with editing. Georges' wife Anne organizes all of their social functions and really it would seem that the group of friends is really her reponsibility, not his. At social gatherings he seems too preoccupied with his own life to give any attention to others. Georges simply seems frozen and remote. When the mysterious packages start arriving he thinks he knows where they are coming from (even though in truth we never know where they are coming from or why they are being sent) but he refuses to share his thoughts with his wife.  This causes extreme marital stress and Anna (Juliette Binoche) is pushed to her breaking point--not so much because she fears the tapes or what they might mean but because she fears that her husband cannot tell her the truth about himself or anything else. Their own son, interestingly named Pierrot (who is approximately the same age as Georges was when the events happened), also suffers because his parents cannot tell him exactly what it is that is causing all of the stress in their lives.  This family is not simply dysfunctional, it is in a state of total breakdown.

The film is reminiscent of Haneke's THE PIANO TEACHER because this film is also about a sociopath. What makes this film potentially more disturbing, however, is that while THE PIANO TEACHER did shocking things we could at least attempt to explain these things away by reference to her traumatic childhood.  But in CACHE Georges, a young boy of six brought up with every conceivable privilege, does a shocking thing and we have no way of understanding why. How can a six-year old do something so cruel? And then keep that cruel act locked up inside for so long? On that day when he was six he ruined not only the other boys life but his own as well. We might say to ourselves that he could not have possibly known exactly what it was that he was doing and why he was doing it but can we know that for certain?

I think the film asks where does cruelty come from, and where does selfishness come from and where does racism come from? What are the reasons, what are the rationales behind these things? And since we cannot say with any certainty where these things come from we feel helpless to find a cure.

A disturbing film that will annoy those who feel like its unfair of filmmakers to give us clues with no real way of finding any definitive solutions to the ""mystery"".  The film will appeal to those who like psychological case studies.",1152057600,38,3739,4.568656716417911

Georges and Anne Laurent lead a relatively idyllic existence in an upper middle class neighborhood in Paris.  He is a well-known television personality who hosts a popular talk show dedicated to arcane discussions of literature (on the French equivalent of PBS, one assumes).  Their 12 year-old son, Pierrot, is, like most 12 year-old boys, moody, taciturn, and only vaguely aware of a world taking place beyond his own circumscribed existence.  One day, the peace of the family is shattered when they begin receiving tapes from an anonymous source showing that someone is monitoring their house from a camera hidden across the street.  This, coupled with a series of mysterious crank phone calls, makes Georges and Anne aware of the fact that they have become the targets of either an elaborate prankster, a potentially dangerous stalker, or a person seeking revenge for some earlier unaccounted-for grievance.

If this had been an American film, ""Cache"" would have been stuffed to bursting with over-heated melodramatics, phony heroics, endless car chases, and about a half a dozen surprise plot twists all leading to a neatly tied-up resolution.  However, Austrian filmmaker, Michael Haneke (who both wrote and directed the film), takes a far more subdued, realistic and sophisticated approach to the material.  He is less concerned with the mechanics of the mystery story than he is with the impact this situation has on the family both emotionally and psychologically.  We begin to see how all the tension and stress brought on by this indefinable threat begins to weaken the fabric holding the marriage together, making it clear that that fabric was actually pretty fragile to begin with.  The surveillance merely becomes the vehicle through which problems and unresolved issues long simmering beneath the surface are finally allowed to rise to the top.  For as Georges goes deeper into unraveling the mystery, Anne senses that she is being more and more left out of her husband's decision making process, forcing her to question his commitment to their marriage and trust in her.  ""Cache"" also effectively dramatizes how tenuous is the ""privacy"" we foolishly believe we have in a world chock full of technological marvels designed to monitor our every movement and action.  The film also has special significance for the French, since it deals with that nation's shameful treatment of the Algerians several decades earlier and the ramifications still being felt all these years later.

There is no doubt that many will find ""Cache"" to be both painfully slow-moving and frustratingly unsatisfying with its deliberately indecisive and inconclusive ending.  But that is exactly what lifts ""Cache"" above the ordinary and the average - its refusal to cater to audience expectations and to stick to any kind of tried-and-true narrative formula.  Add to that excellent performances by Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche in the lead roles and you have the makings of a first-class psychological chiller.",1151884800,2,3011,5.241666666666666
1206500,1,B00000F7E6,"It was slow-moving to the point of ludicrousness. The performances by the actors were all first-rate, but to laud the lack of ending as showing the audience that they should think further on the guilt themes shown in the movie was annoying to say the least. To build

the suspense slowly over the 2 hours to absolute nothingness was very disappointing, and to praise the director for his failure to be able to wrap up a ""thriller"" is the nth degree of putting a positive spin on an overwhelmingly negative outcome.

You have better things to do with your evenings than watch this.",1151884800,18,580,4.621359223300971
1206541,4,B00000F7E6,"Georges (Daniel Auteuil) and Anne (Juliette Binchoe)have the perfect life until a series of tapes begin showing up on their doorstep in plastic bags. The tapes are uninterrupted shots of the front of their house, a farmhouse where Georges grew up and other areas where they have visited and/or lived previously. Georges goes to the police but discovers that these pranks aren't against the law even if they are they are a form of stalking. The title really tells you more about the film in some respects than the film itself--what's most important is what is ""hidden"" or kept from the audience by the director and Georges himself once he begins to piece together things in his mind.

Unsettled and without anywhere to turn for help Georges decides to take matters into his own hands in effect changing their life forever. I should warn you that this isn't a traditional thriller with all the mystery solved and everything neatly tied up in the end. Its been said by others that there are plenty of clues that show the heart of this mystery but I believe the mystery itself (like that in ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window"" both films very much comparable in that respect)the ""McGuffin"" as Hitchcock called it isn't as important as the changes the characters go through because of the mystery that drives the film. Haneke probably doesn't know or care what the real reason is just that it changes the characters in unexpected revealing ways. So don't go into this film expecting an easy resolution--there isn't one. Haneke's film is more about the journey that Georges and Anne take than the destination itself.

""Cache"" demands the viewers attention without a promise of a pay off. Director Michael Haneke makes us, in many respects, both identify with the stalker and Georges & Anne; we are deeply unsettled by this mystery but we also observe it much as the person taking the videotapes on the outside watching things coldly and with calculation. The most important element revealed in ""Cache"" is not the identify or the reason for this strange form of stalking but the quality of the person being observed. The reaction to these strange videos reveal far more about the character of Georges and Anne than anything else. It reveals who they are underneath their veneer of civility and the more we learn that we truly don't knew these characters as they present themselve to each other and us.

The film looks nearly flawless in its presentation on DVD. The 5.0 soundtrack sounds quite good. The extras for those that are interested include a 1/2 hour inteview with the director, a standard ""making of"" featurette and a collection of trailers for other Sony releases. I understand there's a two disc release that was came out in France. It's a pity that we didn't get all of those supplements in the United States.

This unusual film (in French with English subtitles)won't be for everyone. If you want your mysteries all solved like in an Agatha Christie novel or Sue Grafton book than this isn't the film for you. If you like films that present themselves as a puzzle with many possible outcomes than ""Cache"" might be something you'll enjoy.",1151884800,4,3135,4.810760667903525
1206542,4,B00000F7E6,"Good performances by Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche.  Be patient and you'll find the suspense building steadily.

I suspect that you'll surely be scratching your head when the final credits roll, but you'll be rewarded with additional insights upon a second viewing.  The interview with the director will help unravel SOME of the mystery too.",1151798400,,514,5.468354430379747

This fillm is a great sedative.

I regret watching the entire film.  I kept hoping something thrilling would happen.  There is one shocking scene, but it isn't thrilling.  At the shocking scene, I just thought the character deserved the situation he was in for being so dumb.  He shouldn't have been there.  I don't like to give away plotlines, so I won't.

1206544,5,B00000F7E6,"Michael Haneke ('Le Temps du loup', 'La Pianiste', etc) is a writer/director who respects the minds of his viewers.  Nothing he creates is simple, instantly understandable, full of Hollywood endings, nor does he answer the questions he poses. He merely gives us the visual evidence of dysfunction, allows us to watch it without explaining it, and in doing so he makes the viewer an integral part of the film experience.

CACHE is a tough movie, one that requires total concentration on the part of the viewer, and one that presents the secrets and guilt of the characters by allowing us to watch instead of depending on their explanations of their etiologies or resolutions.  Watching CACHE is an exciting and stimulating experience - and at the same time it is a film so impressive that it lingers in the mind long after the film is over.

Georges Laurent (Daniel Auteuil) and his wife Anne (Juliette Binoche) are successful professionals, living with their prepubescent son Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky) in a Parisian home of comfortable means. There is some tension between them (Haneke likes to explore relationships subtlely) but their lives have reached an acceptable, successful routine. A videotape is left on their doorstep: the tape merely shows hours of a camera filming the front of their house. Further tapes arrive (Georges' childhood home, a corridor, etc) as well as  papers and cards with a stick figure smeared with red.  They contact the police who do nothing but Georges and Anne become paranoid and fearful that they are being stalked, that Pierrot is at risk.  Georges has a hunch who the perpetrator might be, but does not elect to share that information with Anne, a fact that infuriates her.  She seeks solace through a mutual friend Pierre (Daniel Duval) who offers her understanding and the suggestion to the viewer that Anne may have a secret about her relationship to Pierre - and Pierrot questions his mother's secrecy.  But Georges' hunch involves one Majid (Maurice Benichou), an Algerian man Georges' mother (Annie Girardot) had wanted to adopt after the 1961 slaughter of Algerians in Paris (another dark secret of Parisians that no one cares to address), and Georges had talked his parents out of adopting the child who would have been a challenge to his territory as an only child.  Georges has nightmares about a childhood encounter with Majid, decides to find him and confront him with the accusation that Majid is sending the tapes.  Majid's son (Walid Afkir) is privy to the past and to the detective work Georges is undertaking, and when Georges final confrontation with Majid ends in a tragedy, the son confronts Georges as being responsible for his father's wretched life.  The perpetrator of the videos is not explained, the schism between Georges and Anne is not addressed, Pierrot's transient disappearance is not fully explained - and the film ends as we, the audience, sit and watch a view of Pierrot's school as parents come to pick up their children.  There is no ending.

Nothing is resolved for us: we are left to make our own conclusions about guilt, about the sickness that guilt creases our lives and molds our psyches, about the need or importance of communication, of relationships...it is all in our hands to decipher what Haneke has put before us.  Each member of the cast is excellent, creating a tension almost as unbearable as the dilemma of the tapes with which we are constantly subjected.  Life is an ennui, broken only by particles of our past and fragments of our actions.  This may not be a movie for the general audience, but for those who are willing to invest time with a master artist of film, the journey is extraordinarily rewarding. In French with English subtitles and considerable disturbing violence. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Grady Harp, June 06",1151625600,6,3817,4.94679186228482
1206545,2,B00000F7E6,"From all the fantastic reviews that I had heard from critics, Hidden was a film I was really interested in. With critics saying that its the most thrilling film in the last decade with its dark atmosphere and emotional performances, I was instantly interested. Considered to be the best film of the year, I rented Hidden in order to find............ none of the above. I found Hidden interesting at first as it headed straight into the story with no delay. Oozing with mystery and a hovering paranoia, I kept watching. I instantly saw that Hidden was a very arty film. With contemporary camera shots and clean scenes, it rediated the directors intention to make this film as modern as possible. As the film progressed, antisipation rises as the identity of the stalker gets closer and closer. But...when finally revealed, the discovery is not as expected and the film suddenly looses my interest. As the mystery to the film's story is revealed and the slow snail pace continues, the film stops being enigmatic and continues being dull and turns a bit boring. As the film continues draining the life out of the viewer it tries to keep your interest by adding more clues and more questions to be answered. Which does amazingly work to reveal yet also nothing interesting. The only moment in this entire film that caught my attention and interest was when a man surprisingly kills himself by violently cutting his own throat. This scene was very good as it was the most realistic and shocking killing I have ever seen.

As the film progresses on with its lack of life, character, music, atmosphere and emotion, it concludes with the most sudden and possibly the worst ending I have ever seen. The ending of this film really hurts, as your left with a deep dissapointment and a thundering headache.

However, this film was not a complete waste of time as it demonstrates the director's abilities in artistic camera work and sence of realism. I did like this approach very much, but it was not enough to keep me happy. Hidden was an interesting film that was far from predictable. The director however, tries hard to make this film so unpradictable that it ruins the structure of the film and its story.

Overall, Hidden is an extremely overrated and extremely dissapointing film. In my opinion, this film does not deserve more than 3 stars and anyone who does rate this film more than 3 stars (which is a lot of people) is seriously over exaggerating and terribly over rating this bland lifeless film.",1151625600,8,2497,4.762124711316397
1206546,5,B00000F7E6,"The latest film by Michael Haneke is also, I believe, his most assured and accomplished work yet.  The film works on several levels.  One of the effects of the ""surveillance"" theme -- and Haneke's brilliant choice to integrates scenes of surveillance seamlessly into the ""regular"" footage -- was to compel me to pay more attention to the screen than I think I have for any film in a long time.  Given that I could not be sure a particular scene was ""part of the film"" or surveillance footage, I watched closely (and tensely) even during scenes in which apparently nothing was happening.  As a meditation on filmmaking and its voyeuristic elements, Cache rivals even Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (of course here the main characters are being watched rather than doing the watching).  Cache also matches many of Hitchcock's best films for its raw suspense, and its compelling narrative (of course, the film probably cannot rival Hitchcock's ability to be both profound and popular -- this film will never be as widely loved as Hitchcock's films, even if it is critically admired; while Hitchcock's films reward patience and attention, Haneke's films demand it).  Beyond that, the film raises in powerful ways questions relevant to the current world situation, and at the same time shows such questions to be not only timely but universal and prevalent. What is terrorism?  Who is the aggressor?  What does it mean to be an agressor?  What is guilt?  Who is guilty?  If my actions have unintended consequences, am I guilty?  If I refuse to face up to those consequences, am I guilty?  Are we responsible for the choices of our parents or of ourselves as children?  Are we responsible for aggressive actions of our governments?  The film aims to reveal the extent to which we hide from ourselves the possibility of our own culpability in actions we did not choose but did not refuse either.  The film also raises, subtly but unmistakably, questions about the continued existence of racism, about the possibility of forgiveness, about the nature of trust, about the function of marriage and the nature of the family.  A really brilliant film that I would recommend highly to anyone who likes to be provoked into thinking  by the cinema.

In addition to the movie, the dvd contains an excellent and revealing interview with the director and a very interesting and well made documentary about the making of Cache.",1151452800,2,2404,4.920595533498759

1206548,4,B00000F7E6,"This is a story that simply will not be hurried. It starts with the longest opening shot in the history of film (maybe!), a view of a family's modestly sized urban home. As the plot develops, Daniel Auteil and Juliette Binochet get pulled into a strange and increasingly tense situation as anonymous ""stalker"" videotapes arrive on their doorstep.

There are mysteries aplenty, and having watched my share of French ""thrillers,"" I knew better than to hope for a neatly resolved plot. (The last one of those French cinema produced may have been DIABOLIQUE.) So while this movie does have its moment of genuine shock, and it does eventually provide some answers, the movie is mostly designed to catalyze further interpretation on the viewer's part.

Which is, of course, the point. So, be prepared for a ""masterpiece of unsettlement."" (Not suspense, mind you. How bourgeois! Unsettlement is much more hip and existential.) I know it sounds like I'm mocking the film, but in fact, I followed it closely and I appreciated its peculiar style.

Haneke creates a unique pace here that, while slow, is never dull. There is always an uneasiness, a sense of malice lurking in the shadows, so that we as the audience are always unsure of exactly what is happening or what is about to happen.

As it unfolds, the film takes dark turns, and there are two distinct points in the film where I found myself gasping for breath. There is an air about the picture, a certain malevolence buried inside the celluloid itself, so that even as the story ends and the audience departs, you are slightly more disturbed than you feel you have any right to be.

I've yet to put a final verdict on the film, it requires a second viewing. Needless to say, it's definetely something unique in cinema, and for that reason alone it gets my recommendation.",1150070400,,904,4.5060975609756095
