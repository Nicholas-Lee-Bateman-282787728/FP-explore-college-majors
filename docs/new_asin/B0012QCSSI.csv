Bayside Shakedown began as an 11-episode tv series in 1998.  [Available with English subtitles only from Malaysia]  The series was successful, and spawned Bayside Shakedown the movie.  Most movies based upon tv series are dreadful, but not this one.  It was one of the most successful movies ever made in Japan in terms of box office.

Bayside Shakedown 2 continues the same quirky combination of sly humor and serious crime.  It is at least as good as the first movie, and possibly better.  Much of the humor is based upon frustrations with Japanese bureaucracies, but it works even for non-Japanese audiences.

The regular characters are wonderful.  This movie tends to focus upon Surime, the dedicated female cop who's very tough, very ethical, and very aware of who is getting the best bento boxes.  Eri Fukatsu is great as Surime.  Most of the rest of her movies are not available with English subtitles.

Fans in Japan collected memorabilia associated with the series (the yellow orange plush toy appearing in many scenes is the mascot of the Wangan Station), and are disappointed to learn that the building used as WPS is not a home to any police.

Bayside Shakedown 3 is due to be released in 2009.",1228089600,,1232,4.832535885167464
