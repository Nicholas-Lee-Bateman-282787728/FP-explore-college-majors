2931822,5,B000V7B90C,"Without a doubt, the best live collection from THE Hard Rock Masters ever released. Wow! It's so great to see so many of these classic videos - many released in the very infancy of MTV, when they used to actually broadcast music by groups that could actually play instruments. Those were the days. There are many previously unreleased clips as well - which also rock. This collection is simply wired for sound! A must have for ALL Hard Rock fans! Trust me, you won't be disappointed. In light of this latest release, hopefully ""Let There Be Rock"" - The Movie, is on it's way to release in DVD format soon!",1192492800,9,605,4.509090909090909
2931823,5,B000V7B90C,"Well, being a long time AC/DC fanatic, I guess I am baised when it comes to releases like this.  I own just about everything they have turned out.  The quality and depth of this DVD set surprises even I.  There are so many tracks, so many great never before seen interviews it is downright a crime to not get this as an AC/DC fan.

As much as I love Brian Johnson, watching Bon Scott tear it up on stage in front of a live crowd is incredible.  My god, he was such an amazing frontman, the best there was.  Ever.  By all accounts he was a very approachable, likable guy.  When he is singing, it seems like he is singing just for you; with a wink of his eye, a flash of his smile, he just flat out made it happen.

Let's not forget Angus who has more energy wrapped into his tiny frame than a nuclear explosion.  I've seen them twice in concert, '96 and '01 respectively and I can say with authority how electrifying they are live.  When they play live they sound better than they do on recordings. It is amazing.

When Brian steps into being, they are dialed up to infinity and have  grinded it out again anad again for over two decades.  I just can't say how much this DVD collection expresses how great this band really is.  Hail, hail to the Kings of Rock!",1192492800,20,1259,4.1875
2931824,4,B000V7B90C,"I think the stuff with Bonn Scott was better because most of it I've never seen.
One thing about the new song that were done live you could tell Angus was gettin old cause he wasn't dance around stage as much.
One of the best AC/DC trademark songs ""Let There be Rock"" & ""Highway to Hell"".
Bonn Scott seemed to be more at ease when he was on stage, I think he sounds better too.
Some of the songs on this DVD are bootlegs so it doesn't sound perfect.
You will see some rare live video clips in this DVD.
Don't get me wrong I like Brian, I just like Bonn Scott Better.
Over all I think if your an AC/DC fan this is a must have.
I would rate this box set a 4 of 5 stars!!",1192406400,3,668,3.847826086956522
2931825,5,B000V7B90C,"Columbia Records will release ""Plug Me In"" -- the
ultimate career-spanning DVD box set of live
performances, interviews and more from AC/DC, the
world's most electrifying rock and roll band -- on
Tuesday, October 16.

The first AC/DC release since the band came to
Columbia Records earlier this year, the AC/DC ""Plug Me
In"" DVD collection brings together for the very first
time an astonishing five hours of definitive live
concert and television performances -- many of them
previously unavailable -- chronicling the ongoing
career (now in its fourth decade!) of a groundbreaking
rock and roll powerhouse whose music transcends the
test of time.

""AC/DC has delivered the most dynamic rock and roll
music in the world,"" said Steve Barnett, Chairman,
Columbia Records. ""Columbia is honored to be releasing
this definitive career-spanning retrospective
featuring many of AC/DC's finest filmed performances. ""

Disc One of the AC/DC ""Plug Me In"" DVD collection
begins with a performance of ""High Voltage"" performed
in October 1975 on Australia's ""King of Pop"" awards
show. The first disc of ""Plug Me In"" is devoted to the
band's formative years (1975-1979) with the late Bon
Scott capturing the group in its full early glory with
more than 20 performances including rare
black-and-white video footage of the notorious St.
Albans High School concert on March 3, 1976; the very
first UK television appearance in July 1976; pristine
live full-color stereo concert performances from
Glasgow and Essex University in 1978; and three songs
-- including the very first public performance of
""Highway To Hell"" -- from Netherlands television in
1979. Bonus material on Disc One includes a Bon Scott
interview from November 1977; extraordinary band
interviews from 1976; and four songs recorded live in
Nice on December 15, 1979, one of Bon Scott's last
concerts with the band before his tragic death on
February 19, 1980.

Disc Two of the AC/DC ""Plug Me In"" DVD collection
covers the band's second great epoch: the Brian
Johnson era which began with the release of ""Back In
Black"" in 1980 and continues to this day. In addition
to more than 20 performances drawn from three decades
of concerts around the world -- including an extremely
rare Japanese television appearance from February
1981, blistering '80s and '90s sets from Detroit to
Moscow, incredible footage from 1996's ""Ballbreaker""
tour (including the ""Beavis & Butthead"" intro), and
21st century barnburners in Paris, Munich, and Toronto
-- ""Plug Me In"" includes a fantastic array of bonus
material including the AC/DC Donnington interview on
the ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" (August 1984) and AC/DC's
in-concert performance of ""Rock Me Baby"" with THE
ROLLING STONES.

A deluxe collector's edition of ""Plug Me In"" --
containing a third DVD of 21 additional rare
performances spanning both the Bon Scott and Brian
Johnson eras as well as a treasure trove of facsimile
reproductions of authentic AC/DC memorabilia -- will
also be available for a limited time beginning
Tuesday, October 16.

The AC/DC ""Plug Me In"" DVD box set is both a Holy
Grail for aficionados of AC/DC as well as an ideal and
comprehensive introduction to the music and history of
a pioneering band that continues to define the
electrifying possibilities of rock and roll.

Formed in Sydney, Australia in 1973 by brothers Angus
and Malcolm Young (still the most formidable electric
guitar team in rock), AC/DC released its first album,
""High Voltage"", in 1975. The group has gone on to sell
nearly 70 million albums in the U.S. alone, making
AC/DC one of the five best-selling bands in American
music history. The ""Back In Black"" album has achieved
RIAA double diamond status, for sales in excess of 21
million copies in the United States, and is the U.S.'s
fifth largest-selling album ever.

AC/DC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in 2003.",1189209600,13,7945,4.718411552346571

However, after watching a bit of the first disk I am surprised that someone could get away with compiling this and selling it.  I would think that would require actually getting good source material not third generation copies or poorly conditioned recordings.  The video has lines in it as you may recall from a beatup VHS cassette.  The audio is mono, some of the audio has static or other noise in it further degrading what might be an otherwise decent listen.

I could not recommend this but to someone who was perhaps there and looking to relive it that doesn't know how to use the internet, this is certainly not archival quality.",1431388800,,744,4.56390977443609

Is a 3 Disc DVD set which is also available in standard 2 Disc DVD set
is a collection of rare interviews and very rare LIVE performances and some of the footage
has never ever been officially released to the Public before
some of the footage has only been available to get as bootleg dvd's
and other footage have been seen on TV as official broadcast footage
Hours & Hours worth of LIVE concert footage and TV interviews
Disc 1 is the Bon Scott era from 1974-1979 which contains
 very very rare LIVE performances never before released to the Public
some of the footage is from very early days of AC/DC taken from 1974-1975
plus very rare interviews with Bon scott and the young brothers
some of the interviews are seen on this dvd in full length complete versions
that were only available as short snippets on TV

Disc 2 is the Brian Johnson era 1980- 2003
and is the same thing Hours & Hours worth of stuff
 very very rare LIVE TV broadcast footage of AC/DC LIVE in Japan during the 1981 tour
there's also some LIVE clips from 1981 TV broadcast
of AC/DC LIVE AT THE CAPITAL CENTER IN LARGO
the best Brian Johnson footage singin at those very Notes in my opinion
this 1981 LIVE version of Hells Bells & Back in black in Largo 1981,
are the best LIVE versions to get as far as i'm concerned
hopefully one day Angus young & Brian Johnson will officially release this
TV broadcast in it's full Glory on Blu-ray
some LIVE footage taken from AC/DC Flick of the switch tour
which are tracks from the U.S. TV broadcasts during 1983
and lots and lots more, you can spend all day watching Disc 2
what's missing, well there's more TV broadcast footage not on this Plug me in DVD maybe it's a copyright issue
AC/DC ROCK IN RIO 1985 TV broadcast concert is missing
AC/DC LIVE AT DONINGTON 1983 TV broadcast concert is missing aswell
AC/DC LIVE CAPITAL CENTER 1981 Full broadcast concert is missing
Disc 3 has some LIVE footage that has never ever been officially released
the Highlight is a 1hour TV broadcast of AC/DC LIVE AT HOUSTON SUMMIT TEXAS 1983
the picture quality of this is excellent definitelty has been Digitally remastered with new 5.1 Dolby digital sound
tragically only some of the LIVE TV footage has been Digitally remastered with new 5.1 Dolby digital sound
the tracks from the Tokyo concert looked to be straight VHS transfer that has only been slightly cleaned up
which is tragic Sony BMG should've made more effort by actually Digitally remastering the footage
maybe they were lazy doing so would've surprise me if that was the reason
if your a massive fan of AC/DC like myself, it's Definitely worth the money buying the 3 Disc set
which has lots more rare TV footage than the standard 2 Disc set
Plug me in should be released on blu-ray now with all the TV performances in new HD transfers & new 5.1 master mixes
which would look & sound incredible
but for now this 3 disc dvd will have to do 5 stars for sure",1415318400,,2932,4.456238361266294

2931861,5,B000V7B90C,"As I was not the one to receive the item myself, I can only go by word of mouth. My father, a lifelong AC/DC aficionado, can be a little hard to please when it comes to birthday presents (see my review of the Marvel Universe Luke cage figure here: http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Universe-Exclusive-Inch-Figure/dp/B00B1F9YNW/ref=sr_1_23?ie=UTF8&qid=1410411924&sr=8-23&keywords=luke+cage+toy), but I am pleased to say I finally nailed it with this one. My dad was almost giddy over the phone after receiving the three-disc set, and again, coming from a huge fan of the band and someone who has always taken gifts with a pretty mellow attitude, that should say an awful lot. I can't wait to sit and watch some of it with him myself.

I bought it for my husband last Christmas; we are both huge fans, but he collects everything to do with them. :) We've been to many concerts and this set really brings home the energy, talent, and staying power of this amazing band from the Bon Scott days to the more current with Brian Johnson. And, of course, plenty of Angus and Malcolm Young! Some of the videos are a bit grainy, but that was a positive for me, as they appear unedited from the time they were created in the Seventies and Eighties.

A great set for any collection that needs some rare and obscure live footage.",1403308800,2,602,4.327433628318584

However, one should keep in mind that the quality of video from the seventies and eighties is not as smooth as that of the later years.  Like a lot of fans, I have some difficulty understanding what Brian is saying when he sings but that does not take away from the enjoyment of this video.

The booklet is well accurated and the other gifts are very interesting: a poster from a show of '79 tour and a pack with reproduction of concert tickets and stage-free passes. In my opinion, a must have for any average fan of AC/DC.",1320710400,,497,4.595505617977528
2931883,5,B000V7B90C,"I never knew I liked AC/DC until a couple of years ago. I'd somehow written them off as cliche, as ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" and ""Back In Black"" have just been too over-played on rock radio. But there are reasons why bands remain as popular as AC/DC as long as they have been - it's because they're good! It's because they're very VERY good!! I gave the masterful guitar work of Angus and Malcolm Young (they're an inseparable team) another listen, gained a new appreciation of the whiskey voice of Bon Scott and his astounding anthem ""Let There Be Rock"" (just one among sooooo many), and fell in love with ""For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)"", along with all of those other Brian Johnson-era masterpieces.

And then I saw this DVD compilation. Wow!! For those who like rock `n' roll, until you actually see AC/DC in action, you really ain't seen nothing yet. I can't believe I've lived 42 years without beholding the magnificence that is this amazing powerhouse of a band. Most people would wonder what planet I've been on, as millions have been to this band's shows (this DVD is testament to that) but now my eyes are open!!! And this is only the 2-DVD set, there's also a 3-DVD version of Plug Me In.

The first DVD is one hour and 46 minutes long and has 18 live and TV appearances of the band with Bon Scott from 1975 to 1979, with nine bonus features that runs 37 minutes long, with TV interviews, live shows and other goodies. The second DVD is two hours and 12 minutes long and has 27 live tracks from the Brian Johnson era, from 1981 to 2003; there are only 17 minutes of bonus material on this disc, five items including a Beavis and Butthead and AC/DC cartoon, some interviews, and a clip of Angus and Malcolm playing with the Rolling Stones in Germany in 2003. The menus and sub-menus have a weird Space Invaders arcade game theme to them, and you get to see Angus duck walking below the barriers shooting at the Space Invaders. Groovy. There are also two booklets that match the DVD themes of a Bon disc and a Brian disc. The first one has a few pics, but it is mainly song credits and a David Fricke essay; the second one is jammed with photos, including a great one of Angus and Keith with contrasting Gibson Casinos (Angus' is red, to contrast his black shirt, Keith's is black, to contrast his red shirt).

Funnily enough, while this collection has all the appearances of being a career retrospective, combining videos from the Bon Scott era (1975-1979) and the Brian Johnson era (1981-2003), it misses a lot of important band history. First of all, Angus and Malcolm Young's older brother George had already enjoyed a bit of an international career with his band the Easybeats when they released the hit ""Friday On My Mind"" in 1966 that's not mentioned anywhere, despite George being an important part of the band's production. Then there was the period with their first singer Dave Evans when not just Angus but the whole band had character costumes of their own (check out the AC/DC dice logo on the bass drum in this video). Finally, the ""retrospective"" seems to conveniently forget about some of the footage that exists that shows Angus in his ""Super Ang"" costume, and only shows his schoolboy gear. It also doesn't show Brian Johnson in any of his pre-AC/DC incarnations, such as with his awesome UK rock group Geordie. Rock `n' roll!!

(For the completist, there are plenty of other nuggets to dig up, which I took an interest in finding some of them after seeing this - there's Bon Scott singing for the Spektors, as a backup singer for the Valentines [check out those awful outfits... and the guitarist's Gibson SG!!!]  The Valentines also did a very nice Coca Cola jingle. Then there's also a bearded flute- and bassoon-playing hippy Bon playing spooky prog rock in Fraternity [once again... a Gibson SG!!!!], before finding his rock `n' roll destiny with Acca Dacca).

But hey, who's complaining - there's over five hours of great archival video footage on this, plus some cool extras. Disc one's 18 songs shows the band coming of age and ""maturing"" (this is AC/DC, they can only mature so much), and as the years progress you see the band playing bigger and bigger venues (the Brian Johnson disc pretty much only has them playing huge venues). What strikes me is the energy of the band, and also the same-ness - Angus always bops in the same way, he always does something goofy (a striptease, running into the audience to play a solo, jumping from the amps at the end of a song), and Malcolm always stays in a wobbly hunched position, while Phil Rudd doesn't gain an ounce from 1976 to 2003 (neither do Malcolm or Angus, more or less), and his gummy jaw action as he plays is really quite... weird. Aside from the beginning of their career, when they were experimenting with their stage duds, they hardly ever vary their clothes either (how many years has Brian Johnson been wearing that cap anyway, for example?).

I also seriously wonder what's in the schoolboy's bag that Angus used to have at his back at all times onstage.

The first video on disc one is from October 1975, from TV Week's King of Pop awards, and the band is playing for a TV audience. The first image is of Angus' guitar, then Malcolm's guitar, and the we see Bon in a... tuxedo and bowtie! The song is, of course, ""High Voltage."" The audience is a bunch of well-dressed white young Australians.  One of them bares his chest for Bon when he gets near. Bon has a bit of trouble with his mic cable as it snarls his legs. Malcolm looks tasty in white pants with a red sweater, red guitar and red knee-high boots! Bon is on fire, loving the audience.  At the side, the orchestra waits for the next numbers. Bon doffs his tuxedo jacket.  Angus is such a wee fellow, his legs so skinny in his knee-high socks. Angus soloing on his knees in front of Bon, like David Bowie and Mick Ronson (almost). Wow! ""It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock `n' roll"" has the band playing for a studio audience of a lot of boogying teens, Bon in a Superman t-shirt with his bagpipes at the ready. The Seventies Austrlian teens are cute, but the fluorescent and lime green summer dresses are pretty weird. One skinny hot chick wears a tank top that says ""Rome"" in what looks like AC/DC font!  Bon really wrings it out in the bagpipe solo.  Cameras are on Bon, drummer Phil Rudd and bass player Mark Evans, but none are on Angus!  Bon's lookin' mighty tasty in those jeans. The TV show announcer comes out all perky... and it goes to a black and white clip from a show at High School Hall in St Albans for two songs - ""School Days"" (which is a ripoff of Chuck Berry's ""Hail Hail Rock `n' Roll) and ""TNT"". The hall is packed, and the crowd engagement is fantastic. Bon is a master of ceremonies, and he and Angus look great in matching striped shirts (Angus is without his schoolboy garb for once). The show is very much like what you'd get these days from someone's mobile phone, it's rough and raw and when one girl hoists a big ANGUS banner towards the stage, you see it from the back! Plenty of shots are of Bon's fore-arm, or his stomach. Pretty basic screwy setup. Angus looks like a little boy. The song goes into crowd call-and-response mode, and everyone goes crazy. Maybe the last time they played a small venue. July 13th, 1976, they played on ""Super Pop/Rollin' Bolan"", Bon shirtless but wearing a collared leopard vest with tails (?!!?!!). He loses the tails midway, and the band rocks into ""Live Wire"". Mean and nasty sex via a microphone. ""If you're looking for satisfaction/ I'm satisfaction guaranteed."" Great Orang amps onstage!!!  Cool song - Angus barely plays throughout the first half, it's all Malcolm's rhythm guitar. Angus' schoolboy uniform looks like crushed velvet!! Great drownout and Angust spazzzz at the end, with full squeal and hop. That's followed in the same set with ""Can I Sit Next To You Girl"", and Bon is all sweaty pecs and abs, Angus in full bluesy stomp - this is one of their oldest songs and they know it well. Bon is pure horniness as he says ""Can I sit next to you - YOU SMELL NICE!"" Seems like an innocent question/statement... but it definitely isn't. The December 26th 1976 show at the Sydney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourn, Australia is a real treat - it's a hellacious (albeit blurry) version of ""Baby Please Don't Go"" that never ever stops... except for an interlude when Angus comes out and does a bit of a striptease... he takes off his striped shirt, walks around the huge stage shirtless, takes his shorts down, walks around in his bikini briefs, does a bit of a moon (with some assistance from Bon), we see his skinny white butt, he suggests showing off the other side, then shuffles off to put on his shorts, and Bon comes back out... vocal thunder for the ladies in the front row, and some wicked soloing, and a rare word from Angus: ""come on, let's hear ya, let's hear ya, c'mon - play me, c'mon.""  The song has the disc's first real guitar spazz-out with real floor-shredding madness, with Angus in his shorts stalking the stage on his scabby knees and shredding around in crazy pinwheels. Really nutso!!! (Don't you dare compare it to the version they do with Bon Scott dressed as a school girl... that is, a school girl to Angus' schoolboy). The next two tracks are from Sight And Sound, recorded in London, the first one, ""Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be"" on October 29th 1977 seems to have come up by accident, as it seems from the intro by host Peter Drummond.

Hello, and welcome to Radio 1 Sight and Sound in concert. Tonight, you may have seen in your Radio Times we were billed to have the sensational Alex Harvey Band. Well, you may or may not know that a couple of days ago, Alex Harvey decided to retire from the world of rock `n' roll, which I think is a great tragedy, and I hope it isn't going to be a permanent thing, but anyway he's decided that, so unfortunately we can't have him on tonight.  But in the meantime, let me introduce to you a band that has recently released a brand new album called `Let There Be Rock', and that's the title of their single as well. And they're going to rock and roll for us right now. (sound of feedback coming from onstage) Hehh.. I don't know if that's part of the sound, but would you welcome please - AC/DC!!

So... who's Alex Harvey? (Well, whoever he was, his guitarist played a Gibson SG!) The show is, of course, totally awesome. An unruly Angus comes out with his schoolboys clothes asunder, a wild-eyed Bon has his hairy chest and his denim vest and his big balls tight jeans in full locomotion. That's followed by ""Rocker"", which has Bon shirtless now and Angus in just his shirt (no jacket or bag). These guys go nutso! Bon is a rival for Robert Plant at this point. ""Boogie woogie!"" A grinning Bon winks drunkenly at the camera as Angus walks up into the audience (and the camera pans across all the '70s polyester and bad mustaches), Angus rubs hips with one woman, there's an Angus imposter in the audience that he goes to hang out with, then he steps dangerously up on the balcony (this guy has no fear of heights) before running back around and then going back onstage. Then he's back spazzing on the main stage. Angus gives it another nutty onstage spinout, fighting and kicking, down on his knees and flailing like a nutbar. April 30th, 1978 they are in Glasgow at the Apollo doing ""Rock `n' Roll Damnation"", great big giant stage action. Angus' schoolboy cap has a big red circle on it - why? Bon has a nice mullet. ""Dog Eat Dog"" is nice, but nothing beats a full-on smoking version of ""Let There Be Rock"", probably one of the greatest rock `n' roll songs ever written. Little Angus, at the end of the song, does a great crowd-raising solo from on top of a Marshal amp, and then... jumps off of it, and then falls on hit ass for a spazz-out, not once but twice! SMASH!!!!!  This is as pure rock `n' roll as it gets. In the ""Rock Goes To College"" songs played on October 28th, 1978 at the University of Essex in the UK, the band plays three songs, starting with ""Problem Child"". Peter Drummond introduces it again:

Hello and welcome to Rock Goes To College. This week we come from the University of Essex in Colchester. We've got a band that's pretty powerful, as you've just heard. They are, of course, AC/DC, who've just completed a four-week tour of North America, which went very well for them, they're just about to start, a tour of...

The band cuts him off, with Bon's ""Thank you Peter"", before jumping rabidly into""I'm hot, and when I'm not - I'm cold as ice."" The crowd goes wild. Bon's got white socks on. Kids in the audience look like Harry Potter. ""Sin City"" is a nut buster, with Angus falling on the ground, the band picks up, and moves quickly into a stompin' ""Bad Boy Boogie"". AC/DC!!!!!!!!!!!  The whole crowd is bopping at this point, amazing. Angus starts the song off soft, then hard, then he solos spinning on the floor. Check out the scabby knees! Midway in the song in the small Colchester club Angus starts to strut around, takes off his jacket, his bag, removes his shirt, rubs it over his body, hangs it on a mic stand, and carries on with the guitar shenanigans, a bit of mellow blues, then some massive stomp. The next show is in Arnhem at a festival, where some weird Dutchman comes out an introduces the band. Bon say ""Hey, you're on TV now, so I want you all to smile,"" slurring his words a bit. Angus' hair is very long now, he looks like a shaggy seven-year-old tomboy as he jumps into a rough, fairly regular version of ""Highway to Hell."" The band's swampy rendition of ""The Jack"" is sweet and nasty. Malcolm Young and Mark Evans stroll up to the mics to sing ""she's got the Jack"", and then robotically return to their spots at the back of the stage. Weird how three of the members of the band are like sidemen, while Angus and Bon tear it up with their theatrics, total contrast. The audience sings the whole chorus the second time around. Angus' solo is pure blues. Love his powder blue socks. ""Whole Lotta Rosie"" stomps along the same stage, and the disc ends.

Disc 2 opens with five songs from a February 1981 show in Tokyo, and Angus' hair is longer than ever. Brian Johnson doesn't wear his trademark cap, and he's looking pretty chubby in his red t-shirt. A show in Maryland is a lot of fun, the stage is wide and the lights are bright. ""TNT"" is interesting, because you hear how the two guitars interact - Malcolm starts off the song, Angus just struts around the stage, but when he comes in you hear it clear as a bell: the two guitars sound very different. While many of the clips are pretty standard and show the workmanlike band rocking out but without any flourishes of interest, the November 17th 1983 Detroit show is a bit more interesting as it includes backstage footage of the band jamming on some blues, having drinks and smokes, with some shots outside the Joe Louis Arena (where they played with Fastway) before getting into ""Guns For Hire"". Angus starts it off with some crazy guitar soloing audience call and response, the dark audience is a sea of cigarette lighters, he jumps off a huge amp, and the band kicks into the song. Very nice. One of the main points of interest on the second disc is the September 28th 1991 show in Moscow, which took place one month after a failed KGB coup on Boris Yeltsin's government with tanks laying siege to parliament. The clip starts off with interviews with young Russians, who mourn those killed in the resistance. AC/DC are not political, and it was all a matter of coincidence timing their show around these events, but it's still exciting for the band, and Angus has a few thoughts:

It's strange being here, so close to the time, you have to admire anyone who puts up a battle for what they want. It allows things like this to go on, where they get to see rock music, and they're entitled to that freedom as much as anyone else in the world. To the youth, you've certainly got to take your cap off to them for making a stand. It shows in them great courage that they stood up. It's like any country in the world, rock music is a bonding, it's something that they can share with their friends. You see the kids today at this show, and they're going to become one big voice.

The disc shows four songs from that festival, and the band rocks the place. Great audience shots of guys in Soviet era official green uniforms with the little pins on them and special official-looking brimmed hats. Chris Slade, a big bald guy, is the band's drummer as Phil Rudd had been temporarily evicted from the seat around this time (considered by many as the band's major creative lull, incidentally). Great shot of a backlit Brian Johnson who looks like he's got steam coming off of him. It must have been a great show, and I do know one person who was there - my band's drummer Val. When they launch into ""Whole Lotta Rosie"" you get to see the big ole Rosie inflatable figure going up behind the stage - crass as hell. And when the last power chord of the song rips out, they pull the plug and the whole thing deflates. Brian Johnson has a few words about the Moscow show:

Four weeks ago we were in London, watching events on television, and we saw these bad things happening, and all of a sudden this wonderful thing happened. People had just had enough, it's a new beginning for rock `n' roll and for the Soviets.

The song goes into ""For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)"" with a video collage of Russian AC/DC fans partying and flashing the devil horns. Guards flashing peace signs. One uniformed guard, though, puts his hand against the camera, but not everybody's that uptight - you can't stop rock `n' roll. Nice to see the AC/DC logo painted across a USSR flag. Fireworks go off at the end of the song instead of cannon fire, awesome. Unfortunately, for the whole song, you always get the feeling that choice bits have been edited in from all parts of the concert into the flow, so you never know if you're seeing what's being played at the moment. But hey - it's all good.  Next up, the ""Gone Shooting"" bit is done in the VH1 studio in London, the band works out the song, lots of shots of Phil Rudd hitting the drums as his gummy mouth jaws wordlessly with the beat. Malcolm's hair is long again, and somehow it's nice to see the band playing in an intimate setting, not some giant festival stage somewhere, and Brian Johnson sort of has this cool, loose shuffle as he sings along. For ""Hail Caesar"" they show the band in Sydney, and deliver a little video clip of a Roman centurion riding up and giving a Hail Caesar - he takes off his helmet and we see it's Angus, ha ha. There are other clips where Angus is edited in to a clip from a Rudolph Valentino movie, a news clip of Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, Spartacus, Margaret Thatcher and Dennis at 10 Downing Street, a clip of Thatcher and Reagan taking an oath with their hands over their hearts, or him duckwalking through old monster movies. ""Ball Breaker"" has Brian Johnson swinging from a wrecking ball hung over the stage, singing away (looks exhausting). Phil Rudd has a smoke as he works the drums, gumming away as always. ""Rock `n' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" is okay, and the ultra-crass crotch-gripping ""Hard as a Rock"" is just that (although we get something special here - Angus croaking ""Harder than a rock"" into Brian Johnson's mic during a lull...). Then, for ""Hell's Bells"", Johnson takes a running jump at a big bell chord hanging above the stage, and the bell chimes in to open the song. But then, suddenly, for ""Ride On"", four of the five guys in the band appear wearing Adidas sports jerseys. WTF? ""Thunderstruck"" is good fun, and then the collection goes into the final three songs, which were performed in Toronto on July 30th, 2003 Rocks For Toronto event to a crowd of 500,000 on a programme with The Rolling Stones, Rush, The Guess Who and tons of other bands. ""If You Want Blood, You Got It"" is a great savage rocker. ""The Jack"" doesn't go off as well, given the demure Canadian crowd that probably doesn't really appreciate such an explicitly macho song, and Brian Johnson tries to get the audience to sing along... and then Angus does his little striptease ting too. With the pantomime hand motions and all that. Of course his boxers have a giant Canadian flag. He jumps into a beautiful bluesy solo, and off it goes. ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" has a new lyric (""knockin' me out with those Canadian thighs""), and there are some disturbing shots of the shirtless `n' sweaty fat man pit, but also some nice pics of pretty girls in the audience sitting on their boyfriends' shoulders, swooning to this romantic ballad of a rock `n' roller to a groupie he actually stuck around the whole night with!

The discs come with some cool bonus material. Disc 1, the Bon Scott disc, starts off with an interview with the band at Sydney airport in April 1976 to talk about releases and singles, but the interviewer also asks whose idea it was to put bagpipes in ""It's A Long Way to the Top"" - George Young's. Angus speaks/slurs! Then a July interview in London, Angus is in his striped shirt, Bon is wearing cutoff jeans and a black belt (and nothing else, really). Bon says that they're better than the Stones and the Beatles. ""Who needs them, they're last year's model."" The interviewer asks if they're rich, he says ""if you poms learned to pay people, we'd get rich real quick."" Wow, the band looks so fresh-faced. ""Keep your eyes open for words and images and pictures and ideas,"" some good songwriting advice. Eating a banana. ""I think it's time we stopped this endless chatter,"" says the interviewer. The band run into a ""saloon bar"" to illustrate their song ""Jailbreak"", ha ha ha... A grainy version of ""Baby Please Don't Go"" from Germany in September 1976, Angus does another strip tease (has a bit of trouble getting out of his shirt). Another grainy ill-lit view of ""Problem Child"" from Melbourne in December 1976. They do a radio promo on video (?!?) for ""Dirty Deeds (Done Dirt Cheap)"", and then there's the November 1st 1977 interview on Count Down. It's a serious interview about touring in the US and the UK, Bon sipping from a drink the whole time, lots of takes it seems. Talks about AC/DC as a punk/new wave band, the interviewer natters on with a long question. Bon natters on with a long answer.

Aw, we're pulling bigger crowds than they are. I mean, we've got our following here, it's not new wave and it's not punk, it's people who like our band. We honestly thought that punk and the new wave thing might spoil it a bit for us, but it hasn't at all.  It was a big fad for a while, like everything else, and there are some who are still hanging on to it, but the main thing about it is it gave rock music a real kick in the gut. And even though we started the whole thing over here - we played here before the Sex Pistols were even thought of - we've always been here, and people are beginning to realise that they want more than just someone up there screaming [affects Johnny Rotten voice] ""anarchy and rape"" and some sort of crap; and we're it, we're doing it right.

History had perceived punk rock a bit differently, but I guess in 1977 things were only just taking shape. Bon talks about singles bands that don't tour much and their fates. Talks about recording in Australia and going home and enjoying holidays (sad - the band is well known for retreating to the Caribbean to record Back in Black as Bon's epitaph album). He talks about his America tour:

We're going back there in a couple of weeks to tour with Kiss, supporting Kiss, and to play with a band called Rush you might not have heard of out there [doltish interviewer agrees - he's never heard of Rush]. We're doing 12 dates with those bands, and a few of our own, and some co-headlining with a band called UFO. The guy that... what's his name, tell me the bass player from Kiss... he's a popular guy. He came along to one of our shows in the Whiskey in Hollywood to see us play, he came up to us and said ""I dig your band, and we're touring in December and we'd like you to tour with us."" And they play to 80,000 people, so the show should be amazing.

Funny how neither Bon nor the doltish interviewer could remember the nane ""Gene Simmons"". Then there's the Top of the Pops clip from June 8th, 1978, where they follow Guy Marks and ""Loving You Has Made Me Bananas"", to play ""Rock `n' Roll Damnation"", all the members looking polished in nice shirts... and then there's Angus. Of course it's all lip-synched. Boney M follows AC/DC. Then there's a short documentary that hypes the band's overseas success overseas. Angus Young and Bon Scott talks about how they're the only band that's playing rock `n' roll. The band is up and talking about all of their great riffs and ideas. Bon gives his sad last words: ""It's gonna get better and better. I can't see an end to it. It's like infinity rock `n' roll."" the last clip is taken from someone's Super 8 footage, showing Angus with his devil horns cap. It cuts in and out, since the camera holder's available film was limited, but it shows parts of ""Sin City"","" Highway to Hell"" and a few other tunes.

Disc 2 has only 17 minutes of bonus material, and it starts out with something from the Beavis and Butthead show, which was an intro to the Ballbreaker tour. The clip shows Beavis and Butthead hanging out at the AC/DC backstage door and try to pick up the groupies that are passing through. Of course they get frustrated and they demand chicks. Angus opens the door for them and passes a dominatrix with a power drill their way. Then there's a January 21st 1981 interview with Brian and Angus. They talk about how to do a show of old Bon Scott songs with new Brian Johnson songs. At least he's still got a ""good set of knees"" Angus jokes. Brian talks about ""when the boys first telephoned us and asked us to come down to have a sing with them and we got through all that and asked us to join the boys, I said yes immediately."" I don't really get the ""royal we"" thing, but hey - it's cool. There's some interview with Angus and Brian about the Donnington festival and a rivalry with Van Halen. ""They're more of a pop band, I suppose, than we are."" There's some goofing around in the studio warming up record ""Gone Shooting"" for VH1 as mics and cameras get fixed. The sound moves around and around, earphone to earphone, and Brian Johnson's mic doesn't pick up, but it's all good. Oh, but then it does. Phil Rudd's beat is unbreakable - it continues metronome-like throughout, totally workmanlike. A cool glimpse into a band warming up as the studio comes alive and gets hooked up around them. The final six-minute clip is of Angus and Malcolm playing in Leipzig in Germany with the Rolling Stones on June 20th 2003 as part of the Rolling Stones' Licks Tour, singing ""Rock Me Baby"". It's cool to see Mick and Angus onstage together, as Angus is sort of like a mini version of Mick Jagger anyway (doesn't anyone else think that they look alike? Of course, Mick is at least a head taller than Angus, but still...). There's a nice guitar pit shot, with Angus, Malcolm, Keith and Ron hanging out, but then Angus comes out and does a cool little solo, playing a red Gibson Casino with a Bigsby vibrato. Mick stands aside and wails a bit, but he doesn't really have much to do. Keith comes out for his own solo, also on a Gibson Casino with a Bigsby vibrato (but his is black), and it goes back into some singing, with plenty of honky tonk piano and some horns.

The DVD has a few cool extras, like a seven-minute ""Scrapbook"" video clip of various articles about the band drifting towards the camera one after another, most of them with cool titles like ""AC/DC: Sex and energy combined"", ""AC/DC - Australia has punk Rock bands too, y'know"", ""A giant dose indeed"", ""The fastest knees in the west"", ""AC-DC punk rock invaders"", ""The lusts of AC/DC"", ""AC'DC boast of sex orgies"", ""Sex, snot, sweat and school kids (Or, AC/DC are back in town)"", ""Going deaf but loving every minute of it"", ""AC/DC's life on the road: no home, no rest and no pants"", ""AC/DC plugs into primitivism"", ""Dirty deeds delight US dodos"", and ""Destroy your brain with AC/DC"". There's a great picture of Angus mooning the audience in one of the newspaper clippings, you can quite clearly see his nuts there. The article talks about The Damned hanging out backstage with the band after their gig at the Hammersmith Odeon. The scrapbook also has plenty of album ads, ticket stubs, magazine covers and concert bills One shows a line-up of Aerosmith, Foreigner, Pat Tavers, Van Halen and AC/DC! A Monsters of Rock bill describes Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Mahogany Rush at Oakland on July 21st, 1979!! Then there's The Who, AC/DC, Nils Lofgren and the Stranglers at Wembley on August 18th 1979!!! AC/DC play with Judas Priest December 7th 1979 in Reims in France!!!! Then the ugly articles come - Bon Scott found dead on February 20th, 1980. Oh man... The ""Scrapbook"" on the second disc is less interesting, with articles declaring the search for a replacement for Bon Scott was over, and then backstage passes, flyers for shows, ticket stubs, and other memorabilia. As the years go by, articles come with lame titles like ""AC/DC - they just can't stop touring"", ""No power shortage"", ""Highway to heaven"", ""Giving the fans what they expect: rowdiness"" and ""AC/DC - the last rock `n' roll heroes"".",1313280000,,29491,4.489191203876258

The mind's image of Bon Scott in a dress and pigtails is rather repulsive, but when you actually see it, it's very funny.

I read the reviews below which panned this offering because it didn't have Dolby sound. Well, I'm not a sound expert, so I can't tell you whether it does or doesn't have Dolby sound, but I can tell you that it sounds GREAT to ME. That's all I care about! Besides, if you look at all the reviews that have been posted on Amazon by the others who have whined about the sound on this DVD, you will see that the vast majority of them are negative reviews. Seems like some people just enjoy looking for anything to complain about and when they find it, they have a field day.

I do understand that sound is much more important with music DVDs than regular movies (to me, anyway). I get that. The fact is, though, that unless you are a sound expert, or someone who can hear a pin drop 50 feet away, then this DVD sounds just fine. Great, in fact! I give it five stars. No, it's not perfect, but then, nothing is. The five star rating is because I don't know how to give it four-and-a-half. AC/DC fans, get this DVD today!!

2931921,5,B000V7B90C,"Kiss could take a few notes from this 3 DVD set on how to improve their own ""Kissology"" series. AC/DC leaves nothing on the table, and this set is packed with performances, interviews, bonus footage, etc.
  Disc one starts with the Bon Scott era, and it is amazing to see just what a powerful frontman he really was. Watching the 1977 interview with him, Bon comes across as almost shy, a far cry from his stage persona. You see Mark Evans, the original bass player from 1975-1977 in about half of the performances, and then Cliff Williams, the current bassist, come into the picture. One could only wonder how AC/DC would have progressed had Bon lived.
  Disc two is the Brian Johnson era of AC/DC. From the widely popular ""Back in Black"" album on up, Brian's vocals fit perfectly with the band (as Bon's did, but in a different way) and he had his own definite stage presence. I really can't understand how difficult it must have been for Brian to try and fill Bon's shoes. The performances, from concert footage, to television, and the interviews in between are just awesome.
  Disc three has a lot of rarities (such as Angus and Malcolm playing onstage with the Stones) to band rehearsels for the ""Flick of the Switch"" tour, to the Beavis and Butthead intro of the ""Ballbreaker"" tour.
  Overall, I highly recommend this to any rock fan, as well as any AC/DC fan, and it is just an awesome package. One thing that you won't see AC/DC trying to do here (listen up, Gene Simmons) is milk their fans for every red cent they can get and delivering sub-standard releases. They put all their cards on the table with the production of this DVD. A+.",1199923200,,1644,4.549152542372881
2931922,5,B000V7B90C,"WOW what a set to own.  The footage was way cool and seeing AC/DC in its early years was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Bon Scott made his singing look so easy and the songs he wrote are fantastic and many.  To see Angus Young in his early years, what a nut case and it exhausted us just watching him play and run around, spin on his back on stage.  He has to be one of the worlds greatest guitar players.  The SAGA of AC/DC was WAY COOL.  This album is Golden and a MUST HAVE for any AC/DC FAN.  Old footage and new was great and it was really neat to see the differences between Bon Scott and Brian Johnson. Man what a set to have forever.  LEGENDS of Rock and this set should be LEGENDS of DVD's.",1199577600,,688,3.9347826086956523
2931923,5,B000V7B90C,"At the end of Disc one, the so called Bon Scott Era Disc, Bon is talking about how they write and basically, the more they toured, the more they wrote and recorded; Well, an Eerie comment to make in a period not that long before his passing, but one that seems to show the way the ACDC formula worked.
Through a Mixed bag of Very Good Quality Video to some not so great Quality video, that still sounds awesome. This is more of a full on, warts and all ACDC-ology instead of the somewhat Sanitized KISSOLOGY series( and yes I have all three of those, and Yes I am a KISS fan, but more of the Original lineup)... anyways, I just mention that for comparison purposes, which is basically, KISS talk about pleasing the fans, where-as ACDC very much lived this Ethos ( and if you have heard the story behind ""A WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE"" then pleasing the fans assumes a whole different level there).
The 3 disc set is definitely the way to go, as good as disc one and two are, the added items like the variation on the Angus Stutue animation on disc 3 is a great watch ( you will know what I am talking about if you have the 2002 Live in Munich concert that has a superb version of the Angus Statue going through Munich, also if you saw that tour with the Statue and what it could do, this will be a big plus as well).
Anyways, all I missed was BIG GUN. And whilst I think about it, the track with Angus and Malcolm on stage with the Stones playing a Song is a wow... ;the Gibson  , GS I think, looks almost bigger than Angus's upper Body; how he played that thing I don't know, but he cruises and ""Blues-es"" his way with the Stones as only Angus can.
Wins my vote !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just a few notes on the Quality of the DVD Pack presentation: its fabulous. The design is so obviously for the fan and the collector that they deserve full marks on this set. Few Packs have this kind of quality. You may want to laminate the extras in the inserts as well as the poster, alternatively buy an additional copy. I know that with the KISS Orchestra Pack, I bought a second copy because the package was not good quality, and the Sabbath 2 disc set Collection with the Guitar Pick ( so called Digipak) needs some care taken with it. The ACDC pack is built to take repeated opening and closings, basically made for regular use, like the EDDIE'S  ARCHIVES, and for those who recall it,  the  EDDIEs  HEAD  pack released in the 90s was a good idea but poorly presented, however the discs inside were the best of the Beast. The point of what I am saying is that few bands take care with special releases that fans like, and ACDC  have done PLUG ME IN as a great pack.",1199145600,,2642,4.23015873015873

The Bon Scott years footage is fantastic, with some seriously enlightening early performances as well as the band at their height.  I felt the Brian Johnson years lacked something.  Perhaps it's the emphasis on later performances, rather than more stuff from Back In Black - For Those About To Rock years.  But perhaps there just wasn't much available.  Most tragically, whoever ok'd the publishing of the ""jam session"" with the Stones was perhaps a bit blinded by the idea of it because the execution is embarrassing.  Terrible soloing from everyone, terrible mix, and somehow they decided to carry on after the first attempt to end the song, as if by doing so they could perhaps make up for the mess they'd already made.

2931929,4,B000V7B90C,"Finally another AC/DC compilatin besides family jewels, no disrespect to that DVD but after watching it I found myself feeling like there was more to be seen. Sience i'm a hard core AC/DC fan, i've seen alot of ""rare"" AC/DC footage and proformances, but I was surprised when I found myself liking this DVD more and more as I kept serching around it. There are so many things I like about this DVD, and a few things i'm not so pleased with.

The good: First off the Bon disc is awesome, lots of great rare things on here, like there 1976 proformance of ""Baby, please don't go"" by far the best on the DVD.

  Another great addition that I think is long over due, was the release of several ""Rock goes to college"" proformances (Which, in my opinion, is there best gig with Bon Scott). The bonus features are amazing, one great one was the Bon Scott interview form 1977, uncensored!
All 14 minutes of it finally realesed on DVD. The Dirty Deed promo was great, shockingly I had never seen it before.

  Brian's disc was great aswell, but my favorite thing about it are the bonus features, when I saw it had them proforming with the rolling stones I fegured it was the on I had seen many times before, but shockingly I had never seen this one. It was great! Gone shotin' was good too, and the Brian Angus interview was really good.

the bad: The Bon disc was, for some reason, shorter than the Brian, which doesn't make much sense because there were alot of ""Rock Goes to college"" songs that were missing. Which brings me to my next point even if they didn't want to put it on disc one, there was tons of room on disc 3 for the rest of the show, which I would have liked more than live at
Houston summit(Which didn't contain the whole gig), even though it was a great show, it's no ""Rock goes to College.""

  Another problem I have is that on the bonus disc they left out the original ""Jailbreak"" music video, that was filmed in Bons backyard (sound pretty important to me).

Overall it's a very good DVD and I would suggeust it to hardcore fans (Who probably already have it), and the folks just getting into AC/DC, with out having to try and serch down videos to see a good show, from the Bon years.- Chuck",1196985600,,2203,4.333333333333333

2931947,5,B000V7B90C,"Breathtaking.

I personally never went after bootlegs or rarities from any band, even the ones I really enjoy and have all the catalague, like AC/DC. So, for me, almost all the footage contained in this set was a first-time experience. I'm astonished.

Everyhting is worth here, and for such a fair price we have a deluxe edition with almost 6 hours of music and interviews. Of course, AC/DC being AC/DC, there are no interviews made especifically for this set, which is a shame... Anyway, since this is not intended to be a official doccumentary, but a ""videomentary"" showing live performances since the beginning, it's understandable that the guys from AC/DC don't appear exclusively for this set.

The high points are so many that it's not worth to listen them... the live version of ""Gone Shooting"" for VH1 is unbeliavably good and warm and gives you a hint of what these guys probably can do when they are just jamming for themselves... And what about ""Ride On""?? Quite a surprise!

A sad moment is when Bon, in an interview backstage, says that they are getting better and better, that great riffs and ideas are coming at full speed, and that he thinks this would go on forever...

2931951,5,B000V7B90C,"I had one hell of a hard time obtaining this 3-disc version, but it was well worth the effort.

First of all, for those out there who think that the ""special-edition"" 3rd disc is 20 minutes of stuff you've seen a million times that they slapped on so they could charge more, well, think again. Disc 3 is 2 HOURS of bonus live performances. The equivalent of an entire AC/DC show for your viewing pleasure.

I won't go into the details of every song on this incredible set as there is a list with the item listing. The first disc covers the Bon years for more than 2 hours. The second disc covers the Brian years for more than 2 hours. Disc 3 covers both eras for an additional 2 hours+! So we're talking around 7 hours of live AC/DC covering 30 years of history! Wow!

This set is amazing! With great animated menus with an animated seedy bar/video game backdrop to an Angus video game playing while you're checking out menu options to a cartoon Angus hopping about while each clip loads. It's clear to see that a lot of work went into the package as well. This special-edition includes a full-color booklet, an envelope stuffed with replica badges, ads, stickers and passes from various tours and so on. Even the box when, held up to the light, reflects memorabilia from a history of touring.

There have been those who have complained about the video and sound quality. I don't have a problem with these aspects. Of course improved/remastered picture and sound are always nice, but I think the idea here was to present the material as it happened. A lot of these live clips were for TV/promotion in Europe and I'm fairly certain the idea was to show it to new viewers the way folks saw it back then.

Plug Me In is an historical timepiece charting the rise of, in my opinion, the greatest rock band of all time. Seeing Bon, Angus and co. belting it out in a HIGH SCHOOL GYM! in the early days in grainy, poorly shot black and white on Disc One to their most recent gig in front of 200,000 people in Toronto shot with multiple cameras and so on is a testament to how hard and how long this band worked to get where it is today. That's the point of this set, to show fans the journey from novelty/small time act to Hall Of Fame inductees.

The music is great! And there are a lot of tunes fans just don't here live anymore. Gone Shootin' has always been my favorite and it's on here twice! The performance of Ride On during the last tour was moving as Brian introduces it as ""a Bon Scott song"" -- something he never does with the other Bon material. The personal, foreshadowing lyrics and the fact that it is performed in Paris where the Let There Be Rock movie was filmed back in 1979 (just prior to Bon's death) make it one of the highlights of the set.

If you're a fan of AC/DC, this set will not disappoint. Although I recommend the 3-disc version highly, the 2-disc contains most of the material. But if you want it all, go with the 3-disc. A great collection from the greatest rock band around! How can you lose?",1193702400,5,3019,4.3612099644128115

some of the video is rough indeed, but in my opinion its part of the history, and it indeed makes it a much better experience. i too could have done without the giant highway to hell poster, and all the little ticket stubs, but still pretty cool to read them. All in all realy a well done 3 disc set....and again in my mind its not about what songs were on there, and what songs werent, its all about watching and enjoying.....so buy this disc, sit back, turn up the volume and rock n roll!!",1193443200,2,860,4.047058823529412
2931954,5,B000V7B90C,"OK, just pop in disc 1, look at the hilarious arcade computer game menu, and you know it's gonna be fun. Because AC/DC was and is always in for a bit of fun. Have a good time, while rockin' out. Judged from the content on this boxset, that is very obvious. Select ""Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be"" and you just can't not bang your head a little bit to the electrifying sound, which, on this track, sounds absolutely brilliant, beautifully remastered for this release. The really old clips before that sound a bit muffled, probably because of age. Further on the sound is varying between spectacular and a bit cranky.
I understand that the restoration people only can do so much, but I'm very satisfied with their clean-up work.
At last, with this release, we get to see Bon Scott's funny stage persona in full, making funny faces and winking at the cameras. In ""Rocker"" you can't stop laughing when Angus goes into the frozen (from shock?) audience and gets in their hair. More jokes from the band as they cut off Pete Drummond's intro speech on camera, and just kick off with ""Problem Child"".
The selection of songs is very good, although I suspect that some fans will miss their personal favorites.
Rounding out disc 1 are some cool vintage interview clips with the band and one long interview with a very laid back Bon Scott.
Disc 2 contains live material with singer Brian Johnson. As there are several live dvd releases out there featuring Brian, most fans are familiar with Brian's showmanship. It's nice to see some of his most early footage with the band, from 1981, including some interview clips, where he admitted that he didn't realise what he was in for or how big the band already had become.
Especially cool is the VH-1 clip where we see the band in a very small studio space as opposed to the large stages we have seen them up until now, but with a good sense of being a tight unit and comfortable with each other and just enjoying playing rock n' roll together. Rehearsal footage made during the soundcheck for this session is presented as a bonus, also very cool. We see Angus playing with a cigarette in his mouth and just jamming along. The sound starts out a bit crap, because it's a soundcheck, but later on we get to hear the instruments getting into the mix and Brian's dancing along.
The other cool extra on this disc is live footage taken from the Rolling Stones 40 Licks tour, where AC/DC probably shared the bill on that day in 2003.
Angus and Malcolm join the Stones on stage to play ""Rock Me Baby"", an old B.B. King blues track. Keith and Ron Wood and Angus doing his usual funny thing, just a pleasure to watch. You can tell by the look on all of their faces that The Stones and the Young brothers really had some fun there.
Disc 3 contains first of all some tracks that have been cut from disc 1 and 2. Why not put it there in the first place? I don't know. Maybe to ensure picture and sound quality with a high bitrate on those discs. Maybe to give the fans some extra stuff for buying the Collector's Edition. Among the highlights is a clip with band rehearsal footage from 1983, where we see the band playing facing each other, a set up anyone who's playing in a band will recognise. Great stuff.
Also featuring on this disc is a big part of a concert filmed in 1983 in Houston, with 9 songs in a row. A bit of a shame that they didn't put the entire gig on here.
All in all, I had a great time going through all this stuff, and I'm very pleased that live material from the Bon Scott era has been made available. I still can't believe the energy Angus has when I see him play (I myself saw AC/DC play in 1988 and 2000). The way he moves like he's on full tilt and bangs his head, as if he's the greatest fan of the band, and then play so effortlessly, amazing. Especially the old stuff is great where he looks just like a kid (and probably was).
Apart from the great dvd's you get a nice booklet, and some facsimiles from old concert tickets and backstage passes, and a concert poster from 1979.
A spectacular set for a great price. Highly recommended! And Amazon, please, don't list this as a Rolling Stones release, they're on 1 bloody track for pete's sake. This is AC/DC, man.",1193270400,44,4212,4.373724489795919
2931955,5,B000V7B90C,"Warning, this is for hardcore AC/DC Fans.  If you are a casual fan, you probably won't like it.  It shows some vintage footage that doesn't have best sound or film quality. However, that is the beauty of it.  They didn't have the high def or surround sound that we are use to now. It is like opening a time capsule on the greatest hard rock band ever.",1193270400,2,351,4.208955223880597
2931956,5,B000V7B90C,"I got the 3 disc set with all the extra's and am very happy with what I received.  I have a rediculous home theatre setup and some of the older stuff did have some clipping and hiss, had me thinkin my roomie blew my center speaker and didn't tell me.but most of the audio sounded great.  This is a must have for any true AC/DC fan.  These dvds show why AC/DC are one of if not the greatest Rock & Roll bands of all time.",1193184000,4,420,3.9176470588235293
2931957,5,B000V7B90C,"The performances on this set are legendary.  Anyone considering buying this set knows the drill when it comes to AC/DC.  I think they're the greatest live band in rock history and this set really captures that.

I don't understand the complaints about the sound quality on here.  I should say that I'm not an audiophile (although I do have a 5.1 surround system) but I think the sound is great.  Sure, some of the earliest clips are grainy and the sound is relatively poor compared to the sonic beauty that we're used to nowadays.  Just remember that some of these perfomances are from 1975 and they were filmed in a high school.  What do you expect?  The terms ""cleaned up"" and ""remastered"" aren't terms I usually associate with AC/DC.  I think leaving the early clips raw and original gives them a authenticity and intensity that blows me away.  If you're an AC/DC fan don't be afraid of sound issues with this set.  The performances are well worth it.

The extras are great too, especially the rehersals.  Thanks for all of the memories.",1193097600,11,1040,4.648351648351649
2931958,5,B000V7B90C,"I am buying this set largely for the Brian Johnson era material, especially the Summit '83 footage.  Flick of the Switch IS the most underrated release in the AC/DC catalogue, and I look forward to see these classics performed live.

Great retrospective guys...now can you finish your latest album and come see us all on tour?",1193097600,6,326,4.803571428571429
2931959,5,B000V7B90C,"I was eagerly awaiting this release. and it certainly didn't disapoint! As much as I liked ""Family Jewels"", I like this much better. Why? Well mainly because it's AC/DC live in front of an audience, which is what they do best. And also because it also covers the years from 1996 to 2003, which Family Jewels doesn't touch. I'm a fan of both Bon and Brian, and both have great showcases here. I particularly enjoy the old historical footage on disc 1 that shows AC/DC in some of their early club performances. It's easy to see how they built their legend in Australia (especially the black and white St Albans and the color Myers Music Bowl footage). And disc 2 shows how they've kept the legend going all the way to today. The extras on here are great too, encluding interviews and TV spots and promos over the years. Plus the portion of the 1983 Houston Summit show on disc 3 is a great mini-concert. So while there's no complete shows on here there's a good reason for that. It's a retrospective and they can get much more on the way it was done. Besides the 3 disc set is 7 hours long as it is and we all have full length AC/DC concert DVD's at home anyway. There's been a little complaining about sound quality on other reviews, but as it states on the package the clips were chosen here for historical reasons first and foremost and some of them we're lucky still exist at all. Trying to mix this for surround considering the varying sources these clips came from and varying quality would have been a huge undertaking. Early VHS and 3/4"" video cameras had limited audio capabilty anyway, but nothing here is unlistenable. Besides if you're Joe Audio and have to have everything in 5.1 you probably have Donnington or Stiff Upper Lip anyway. No, instead enjoy this set as it was meant to be, a must have for any and all AC/DC fans as a testament to the greatest live rock and roll band ever! Enjoy",1192838400,9,1902,4.437142857142857
2931960,3,B000V7B90C,"I am torn on this set. I love this band. Seen them three times live. Have every album, including imports. I wish I could have a Bon Scott concert with good sound. Why can Led Zeppelin remaster their DVD and not AC/DC. While I still would buy this set, just to see my favorite band and add it to my collection, I am hoping they spend some time and money and remaster ""Let There Be Rock"" the movie in 5.1. I would forgive them. Family Jewels in 2.0 was unacceptable. Every band has a greatest hits in surround sound I can think of.

This is still worth buying. Just have to find a good setting on your receiver and live with it. After you're done, throw in Donnington, or Stiff Upper Lip Live and then you will appreciate your system that much more!",1192838400,,747,4.223776223776224

What about the fact that I cannot play the darn thing in my computer's DVD player!!!!! Is there some type of cripple on it to prevent this?

IS anyone else having problems?

2931963,3,B000V7B90C,"I agree with Brian on many of his points and I have a few things to say about this 3 DVD set..
I bought it today (3 DVD set) at Best Buy for $34.99. IF you bought a Audio CD Sampler they have avaiable of PLUG ME IN.. ONLY thru Best Buy for $1.99..you get a coupon with the CD worth $3.00 off the price of either DVD set. They are selling the 2 DVD set for $16.99. Both of these prices last until 10PM on October 20th.
As far as the quality of this set and the 3rd DVD...Here goes
The sequencing on this is dissapointing...AND for those of you have acquired AC/DC video material in the past (bootlegs)..you also know that most of these performances are not only out of sequence..but are also INCOMPLETE...like some songs were left off the DVD intentionaly.
This is quite evident in the Bon Scott material.
I have a great ROIO DVD (called LIVE WIRE...LIVE FROM EUROPE 1977-1978 from the Captain Video Label) of all three of the Bon Scott Concerts from the Rock Goes to College, Sight and Sound and the Apollo Glasgow Scotland..and they are all COMPLETE performances and I have to say actualy BETTER video quality than what's provided on this disc. The audio on this DVD is in sync with a Stereo mix and is outstanding..but songs are missing..and some of these songs that are missing are on the Family Jewels DVD set..i.e. RIFF RAFF from the Glasgow is the first song..with R& R Damnation is second and so on..
The 1983 Summit Houston TX concert is of excellent quality for its day..being shot on 3/4"" videotape (Video geeks will know what this is) and the audio is a ""live mix "" from the video..not post produced in stereo or anything..just a basic 2 channel mono mix with the mix at the mercy of the FOH audio engineer. BUT as the other concerts on here..it is INCOMPLETE....the concert IS played in sequence for what was played on the Flick Of The Switch tour..but its missing the 5 last songs of the concert....after Hells Bells which is the last song on the disc..its missing Highway To Hell, Whole Lotta Rosie, Let There Be Rock, T.N.T. & For Those About To Rock.
The interview stuff on the 3rd DVD is interesting, but IMO not really enough to buy the 3 DVD set.
The only reason to have the Bonus disc iS if you really want/love the Flick Of The switch tour for the Houston TX show. The poster (which is pretty cool...but), backstage passes, ticket stubs, etc..that are included in the 3 DVD set are all to me just a waste of time/material unless you are into that kinda memorabilia. Instead of the memorablila stuff..I myself would have rather had another DVD included with COMPLETE & in sequence concerts from the Fly On The Wall, Who Made Who, or Blow Up Your Video tours..which ARE in existance!",1192752000,41,2702,4.449596774193548
2931964,4,B000V7B90C,"In the anticipation of waiting for AC/DC to release there new album, Sony have gathered together this 3 disc collectors edition of some rare performances and clips you may have seen that is mostly all live. Saying that, there are a couple of performances that are miming, but thats due to TV shows making them do such a thing for whatever reason they have. But still good to see them on stage performing it, in a way.

This is kind of like Family Jewels, only the performances are live. Starting with some rare black and white footage from 1974, the sound quality is not great, but after all, this is a collectors edition, so it will most likely be AC/DC fans purchasing this.

The titles are already written on the reviews here, so i won't waste time writing that out again.

The only reason I don't give this 5 perfect stars is not because of sound quality, but for not containing footage from the Fly On The Wall or Blow Up Your Video tours.

Apart from that, this is a must have for the AC/DC fanatic that can not get enough of the worlds most electrifying band.

As a hardcore fan, I have seen most of these performances via bootleg and live promo clips that have been around for years, but it is great to have much better then VHS quality versions now. About the only promo clip i can think of that is not included here is a For Those About To Rock clip they did as the actual promo. But i'm sure they will release that some day.

Even tho having the full shows of Rock Goes To College and things like that on bootleg and this only shows a couple of songs from it, this DVD still contains a lot of great performances from the last 30 years that I had never seen. in particular, i was ecstatic to see them perform an underrated song called Bedlam In Belgium, I just wish they could have included preformacnes of Thats The Way I wanna Rock N Roll and Are You Ready.

The bonus features are more live clips, and interviews. I had seen most of those interviews before, but not I have a much better quality version then what you can get from youtube or a bootlegged VHS/Beta quality.

The packaging is a nice tall box like that of Bon Fire, containing the 3 discs and a bunch of collectible things and posters. Mostly it is reproduced images of old tickets and badges etc.. and a nice big H2H poster with the promo info on it like what was pasted around places in 79 for that tour. Even the cover of the packaging looks nice, tho it might look black with a shiny AC/DC logo on it, if you hold it in the right light you can see some interesting nostalgia images reflecting off the cover.

Overall, great release, if you are not an AC/DC fan, it's hard to say weather you will like this release or not.  Some have complained already about it not being in surround sound, but it would be annoying to produce some songs in surround and some songs in stereo, you'd be adjusting your audio all the time you are playing it, so it's probably better to just leave it as the one sound throughout it. There is no way they could improve the quality of the sound for the early early footage, the sound is not great, but at least they have done what they can for the footage. They can not get rid of all the lines thought the footage, but I'm still glad to see them perform the Chuck Berry song School Days.

Now heres to hoping that we see a new AC/DC album within this century.",1192752000,5,3366,4.268445839874412
2931965,5,B000V7B90C,"What a fantastic collection of rare and previously unavailable tracs and interviews from AC/DC, one the greatest bands ever to grace a stage.  This is raw stuff...typical AC/DC...and they don't disappoint.  The tracs were left in many of their original forms without the benefit of remastering, but if you have a good sound sytem it won't matter.  It was an intentional decision by the band to show their raw talent, emotion, and sound from their formative days.  Why remaster?  We all know what AC/DC sounds like.  This is more like a historical journey than a concert, and to see Bon, Angus, and Malcomb in those early clips belting out pure rock and roll is an amazing sight.  I highly recommend this set to any AC/DC fan or anyone who loves rock and roll in its purest form.  AC/DC can flat out rock the house, and they tear it down in Plug Me In.",1192752000,2,851,4.516339869281046

8217043,5,B000V7B90C,"Well, there's a great mix of concert footage and interviews from the eras of AC/DC that really matter--Bon and Brian. Not much in the way of complete concert footage--but, the performances of songs are so blistering that I'm sure fans of the band won't mind. Even on some of the grainer concert footage that looks like it was shot a mile away with a camcorder.

It's hard to single out a favorite performance from any of the 2 discs. Without fail--as a live act--the band rarely disappoints. It was even interesting to see some of the 1983 footage after Phil was fired and Simon stepped in. Maybe a bit of a surprise--for me--was ""Gone Shootin,"" an old Bon standard that Brian had no troubles doing justice within the confines of a cozy VH1 studio.

Another highlight or two were ""Ballbreaker"" and ""Thunderstruck"" which never disappoints live. The extras are pretty good too, some humorous, like Angus even poking fun at himself a little bit--as far as the critics of AC/DC always saying they record the same record too many times. In any event, ""Plug Me In"" hits home....",1505260800,,1072,4.696808510638298

I remember watching some of those 1970's video recordings on my 19 inch Color Television , specially the 1975 Television performance of one of my all time Classic Rock songs entitled "" It's a Long Way to the Top"" with the one and only , original singer , Bon Scott.  I may add that watching Angus Young in these rare video recordings , just crack me up , seeing Angus act a fool , even more than he does now.  The energy I received from watching and listening to these original recordings , only empower my appreciation , and respect for a unique Hard Rock Band such as AC/DC.
The rare interview of Bon Scott , make this DVD Set a must have for all AC/DC fans , specially because it was filmed in Black and White.
