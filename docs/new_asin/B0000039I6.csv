1177843,2,B0000039I6,"My VHS of THE ERRAND BOY is not an official studio release. It's one of those budget box brands and is not recorded in SP mode, nor does it have a HiFi audio track.

Based on its width, the photo on this product page appears to be from a DVD, not a tape, so that's no help in determining exactly what version this may be.

Suggest that a potential buyer email a targeted seller by using AMMY's ""contact"" feature, which can be accessed by clicking  next to that dealer's name where it says: (0000 ratings). One might inquire if there's a full tape's worth in the cassette, or even what label it's under.

1177844,5,B0000039I6,"I never really had much of an opinion of Jerry Lewis until I stumbled upon ""The Errand Boy"" on TV years ago. I only saw the clown puppet scene (which is one of the cutest things I have ever seen). Ever since then I had wanted to see the entire movie but just hadn't gotten around to it. Well, we saw it last night with my seventeen year old nephew and it was a riot and VERY entertaining. My nephew is the strong silent type, and it was such a joy to hear him laughing uncontrollably for extended periods of time, wanting to watch certain scenes repeatedly, etc. The ""Whack a Do"" scene is classic and hilarious, so is the Count Basie boardroom scene and many others in between. Say what you want about Jerry Lewis but the fact is that Jim Carrey owes him an enormous debt since he basically rips him off every time he stars in a movie, and in this day and age when there is so much sex and general vulgarity in movies and TV, Jerry Lewis is a refreshing change. Not to mention the fact that this movie stands alone as one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Highly recommended, especially for families. One for the ages!",1277769600,2,1125,4.2372093023255815
1177845,5,B0000039I6,"Hello to all you Jerry Lewis Fans!

I loved this movie.  I especially liked the music by Count Basie when Jerry is sitting in the board room, ""pretending to be the big boss man"".  That part is so hilarious to me.  I have watched this movie many times with my dear twin sister and we both laugh at the same parts in the movie.  Thanks!",1226275200,,334,4.076923076923077
1177846,5,B0000039I6,"The third movie of Lewis as film director, also written ( in collaboration with Bill Richmond ) and performed by Lewis himself, follows the same scheme he invented for "" The bellboy ""; this is a comic film with the structure of a long cartoon and an almost inexistent but necessary plot ( Morty, an anonymous worker from Paramutual Pictures is hired by the major studio's moguls as spy to watch closely how the company's money is spent ), the basic support that allows Lewis to tack a collection of depurated and satirical sight-gags focused in an only stage: this time, in a very particular hell named Hollywood( the name of the movie studio where action takes place, Paramutual, is, of course, a deliberated sarcastic distorsion of Paramount Pictures ). "" The errand boy "" is a subversive ( still today )comic glance to movie industry where Lewis dismounts many secrets and lies of movie business. The film is plenty of delightful comic scenes like that one in which Morty ( Jerry Lewis ), sat in front of the table where the big boss manages the movie studio, develops a mocking caricature of the "" big fishs "" of film industry only with mimicry and the support of Count Basie's music.

1177847,5,B0000039I6,"When this movie came out in 1961, Jerry Lewis deliver a humorous look into what really happens in Hollywood. 44 years later it is still relevent today as it was then. Lots of surprises in this movie including the music of Count Basie in the classic boardroom scene with Lewis mouthing off to the music. I enjoyed Lewis' work in this movie!!",1127001600,8,340,4.5
1177848,4,B0000039I6,"A typical Jerry Lewis movie.  As with most of his, if you don't like Lewis you won't like the movie, but also as with most of his films, it's packed with funny comedy that's mostly timeless and often imitated.
The cast includes  Brian Donlevy (Cowboy, The Quatermass Experiment, Beau Geste, etc.), Howard McNear (Floyd the barber on The Andy Griffith Show), and Joe Besser (The Three Stooges, The Abbott & Costello Show).
The plot's not; just a flimsy frame for Jerry's shenanigans, of which there's enough to fill 90 minutes with laughs, plus a couple cute scenes with puppets.  Jerry's hired ostensibly as an errand boy for a movie studio, but actually to spy for the upper management.  He get's into plenty of slapstick trouble on the job but never accomplishes any spying.
But the comedy is not all slapstick by any means; much of it is poking fun at movie directors and supervisors, and other screwball comedy. One of my favorite bits is when three kids are ordering candy where Jerry's filling in at the studio cafeteria, and they send him up the same high ladder 3 times for different orders from the same giant glass jar of jelly beans. There's also a great basketball scene with the Dover Basketeers.  But wait, there's more, including a cameo appearance by the Cartwrights of Bonanza, Lorne Greene, Michael Landon, Pernell Roberts, and Dan Blocker.
My favorite Jerry Lewis movies are ""The Delicate Delinquent,"" ""Way... Way Out,"" (which doesn't seem to be available anywhere) and of course ""The Nutty Professor"" (nothing against Eddy Murphy, but he's no Jerry Lewis).  I think The Errand Boy is almost as good as these.",1115856000,11,1628,4.838129496402877
1177849,5,B0000039I6,I rank this #3 in my choice of favorites from him. The Count Basie music in his conference room bit is worth it alone. I see familiar faces in the movie including the guy who sold tribbels in Star Trek.  Buy it. You won't regret it.

1177850,5,B0000039I6,"I had never seen this particular Jerry Lewis film until it recently came to DVD and wasn't sure what to expect.  What I saw was nearly 90 minutes of the most biting satire I have ever seen propogated against Hollywood and I love it!  It is incredible to think that this motion picture was made in 1961, it is more relevant now in many aspects than it was then.

Not only does this film have some of Jerry's best comedy--some of it coming from other actors--but it also features some rather touching dramatic moments.",1097884800,9,516,4.468085106382978
1177851,5,B0000039I6,"A knowing and multi-faceted critique of big-studio filmmaking, 'The Errand Boy' is one of Lewis's very best films (it is his third; his fifth, 'The Patsy', can be considered as a sort of sequel). Morty S. Tashman is hired as a spy by the moguls of a major studio because they want to learn how their money is spent. He proves to be a destructive force: just as the prologue had exposed the trickeries and illusions on which Hollywood films thrive, the following 80 minutes show Morty disrupting a few shootings, a voice-recording session, the work of script-girls, and more. He stands as the innocence the producers have lost in trying to make money and please everybody; it is quite easy to read him as 'Lewis the artist'. By the end of the film, Morty has become a Jerry Lewis-like star, proudly saluting his new fans behind dark glasses; he thus seems to have made a place for himself in a world he had previously reduced to pieces. This dichotomy is similar to the one of 'The Bellboy', Lewis's first film as a director: in that movie, the timid, free and inventive bellboy was contrasted with the swagger, aggressiveness and confinement of Lewis playing himself. The brilliant and cyclical final sequence offers an interesting alternative: by having Morty meet a clumsy boy resembling his 'pre-star' self, Lewis assures us that even if some can't escape the studio's mercantile traps, there will always be innocence to be spread in these calculations and falsities. Intelligent, and very funny.",1083369600,11,1499,4.859375
1177852,4,B0000039I6,"Flawed but generally successful combination of pathos and 1930s slapstick: the most insecure guy on the planet is put in charge of internal security for a (wanna-be) major motion picture company. Jerry provides some of the  funniest moments ever captured on film, as he stumbles from one department  to the next, first an as an ""extra"", then as a mailroom delivery  person. His attempts to find a quiet spot for lunch are worth the price of  admission. But perhaps the best scene is the quietest: he finds himself in  the prop department with a miniature clown who ""comes to life"" -  it's a beautifully acted and effectively lit scene. However, there are are  numerous elaborate sequences which prove fruitless, and the movie is  overlong by about 15 minutes. And the character's ultimate  ""discovery"" by the creative powers-that-be is bizarre in light of  the fact that his presence has been unintentionally recorded on celluloid  from day one. Despite the lost opportunities, TEB remains on a level with  ""The Nutty Professor"" - a very entertaining and thoughtful  effort.",963619200,9,1074,5.034090909090909

If you are of the group that either dislikes Jerry or has pretty much forgotten him, then you might want to keep on truckin'...
The Errand Boy was a wonderful family comedy about the movie studios of the time.  You have to remember that the studios of the time had had 50 years of dominance; they were factories for movies with massive numbers of actors, extras, and management.  That studio system is pretty much gone with the wind so this entire concept is dated.  Nonetheless, it's a fascinating and amusing look at the arrogance of management, and you can relate to that for any industry.

1177895,2,B0000039I6,"This is not one of better movies Jerry Lewis did.

The plot is, ostensibly that a movie studio (Para-mutual Pictures) is losing money through inefficiencies or theft in the production process and the errand boy is hired as a secret spy to help discover where the money is going. This could have been a pretty funny movie in a Peter Sellers, Pink Panther type way if they'd followed that plot though with the fumbling errand boy cum detective unraveling the mystery but nothing like that happens. Once the errand boy (Jerry Lewis) is hired the movie devolves into a series of gags based in a movie studio that while funny enough are not really connected to a plot.  It is not even that there are wholes in the plot; because there simply is no plot and the issue of the missing money is never resolved. This would still be OK except only about 1/2 the gags are really funny and some of the stuff that is funny requires a bit of thought. Brainless comedy needs to move fast enough that you don't notice the plot holes and this film does not do that. And what's with the clown hand puppet?

Stick with ""It's Only Money"" or ""Cinderfella"" if you want to see a funny movie with Jerry Lewis. This one just doesn't work",1407628800,,1210,4.417040358744394

1177939,5,B0000039I6,"The two tightest, funniest, philosophically satsifying Lewis', one in brilliant black and white and one in stunning 1963 Paramount technicolor.

First entry from 1961, THE ERRAND BOY, has Morty S. Tashman as studio tour guide (for the viewer) and (supposed) studio ""Secret Shopper"" - actually spy for Parimutuel Pictures...a motion picture company which makes money at the box office but loses money overall. The clueless, unknown hired for this job is...all around studio screw-up, JL. Don't ask. just laugh. (and, please, take special note of brilliant, Fellini-esque shoot of cramped elevator). Film buffs will thrill at the sight of Sig Ruman and Joe Besser, in short but nice cameos.

Second entry from 1963 is THE ""Jerry"" Classic, by far, his greatest film. The scene by scene (sometimes as funny as the movie) narration with the Star-Director-Writer and a singer named Steve Lawrence (who had his own ""hits"" in 1963) really accentuates the comedy...and the *drama*....and the soundtrack....and the innovative technology involved.

The ""Buddy Love"" scenes with Jerry as Professor Kelp's evil, shall-we-say, ""alternate"" reveal Lewis as a powerful actor.

Both movies have a little of that coulda-been-better factor, as some scenes are superfluous and dragged out - but the latter effort flows with ease and cannot be significantly improved upon...correct me if I'm wrong, Actor's Studio.

Jerry had arrived as a Filmaker with these entries.
