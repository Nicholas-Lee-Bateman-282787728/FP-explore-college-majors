8061577,5,B0009IWFPQ,"I rated this a five star because I felt it showed a little of everything Yellowstone has to see and offer to the viewing audience. I have personally been to Yellowstone many times, but I discovered many things in this DVD that I had not seen or had heard about on my travels there. I would highly reccomend this DVD for family enjoyment.",1362182400,3,337,4.365079365079365

8061579,4,B0009IWFPQ,"Not a Blu-ray but it showed so many beautiful parts of yellowstone by area we are looking forward to seeing this spring. I did have a problem with some of the videos not playing on my blu-ray player, but they did play on a regular player.",1358035200,2,238,4.195652173913044
8061580,5,B0009IWFPQ,"Here is a 62 minute long programme of one of the most spectacular places on our planet that really leaves you wanting more!

If you are either a traveller that has been to Yellowstone or someone who is about to visit the park, this Blu-ray DVD will either be a fantastic momento of your travels or will provide you with the incentive to go as soon as possible with a really good idea of the places you must visit during your stay.

The HD photography and original music soundtrack are stunning and the narration is superb. You will hear a mixture of interesting factual information on history (only brief), the park's wildlife, geothermal features, scenery and historic buildings. There is amazing photography of the park's main scenic features filmed on nice days so that you can see them at their best. The documentary follows the main loop road from Madison Junction south initially and around the ""figure eight"" showing all of the best sights. I particularly like to see people walking the trails who are enjoying great scenery and wildlife. There are fantastic shots of Yellowstone's wildlife including many bear scenes. There are nice views of Yellowstone Lake and the Absaroka Mountains still snow capped. The programme finishes with some crisp winter snowy scenes and these make it difficult to decide upon the best time to visit this heavenly place.

Not only is this a beautifully produced product, it is REGION 0 meaning it will play in any Blu-ray player in the world. Most of the Blu-ray DVD's in America will only play in Canada and the USA and this makes the region free products from FINLEY-HOLIDAY even more attractive!
Thoroughly recommend this product.",1343174400,7,1671,4.876760563380282
8061581,5,B0009IWFPQ,"We just spent two plus weeks visiting what had been on our bucket list for years.(Rapid City, Little Big Horn,Glacier,Yellowstone, and Tetons). We bought DVD's at the gift shops to take home with us for great memories. This tape was recommended in several shops .... and they were right. It is a great tape and we were not disappointed. We had a couple cameras and a flip video, but could not come close to matching what is on this tape!",1285891200,5,437,4.475
8061582,5,B0009IWFPQ,"I am a huge fan of Yelowstone National Park, and of actor Joseph Campanella from when he used to appear on one of my favorite soaps.  He narrates this film, and it is great.  All of the major features and park  areas are covered, and compared to some other Yellowstone videos (I've seen  'em all!), the pictures are clear and sharp.  I think this is THE video for  anyone who wants to learn about (or re-visit) such a spectacular place.",949190400,21,436,4.3875
