8330003,2,B001O9YW7S,"I received the dvd on time and packed well enough. However the disc freezes up and/or stops (because it doesnt have the full length video on it in the first place, and clearly is a copy made on a dvd with only a plain white cover on the dvd. THE dvd is listed on the cover as being 60 minutes long but it only played for 45 minutes and then went directly to the title screen. It says on the cover that it is made from archival print . It is not cleaned up or even very clear in some of the scenes that did play all the way through. I would not reccomend this dvd to any die hard Seka fan as they will be disapointed. It was bad enough that the video tapes from those times often didn't have scenes in them that were pictured on the cover art and in many cases did noy even have the pornstars listed on the cover or in the credits on the video. Fans of the older movies run into this alot, so when this happens on a dvd and isn't pointed out in any note accompaning the dvd transferr we feel ripped off and mislead yet another time.",1377648000,2,1031,3.9615384615384617
