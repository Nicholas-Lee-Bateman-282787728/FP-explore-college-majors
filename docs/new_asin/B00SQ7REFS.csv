8699065,2,B00SQ7REFS,"My review is for the state of the disc not the program. I love the content but 25 bucks for a DVD-R is pretty steep. This disc like my Shorinji Kempo disc is badly scuffed and scratched. The product page does not state these are DVD-R's. It's very interesting content, just poor manufacturing.",1474848000,,293,4.547169811320755
8699066,5,B00SQ7REFS,"Briefly, this episode ( two ) on the Warriors of Budo series has one good thing, quality. In a short time it shows how the changing needs of the times influenced changes in the philosophy and the practical in the Okinawan and Japanese art of karate do. The only thing it may lack are old film clips when talking about past masters. But owner rights and so on may have complicated this. Nonetheless after seeing this episode on the Warriors of Budo series I ordered the ones on Judo and Shorinji Kempo expecting the same quality. Empty Mind Films has many other topics of interest in the Asian way of life. Check it out.",1458518400,,619,4.43859649122807

8699068,5,B00SQ7REFS,"This picks up well after the first video.  More emphasis this time on Shotokan and a couple of offshoots, as well as Kyukoshin.",1442016000,,127,4.521739130434782
