8101556,5,B000CS45ZG,"In my view, you can never learn too much about Frank Serpico.

Younger viewers may not know who he is.

 Briefly, he joined the NYPD in 1959 as a patrol officer, saw

poor work

and corruption and tried to expose it to the NYPD.

For various reasons, the NYPD did very little to admit or

combat the problem.

As always, most of the cops were honest.

But they did not go public with what they saw other cops do.

Serpico tried to fight

the problem privately, without fanfare.

But the NYPD continued to do very little.

 Serpico then went to the New York Times.

 The Times investigated thoroughly

and shocked the world with what they printed.

Many cops feared Serpico after that.

 Honest cops felt that he had smeared

the whole NYPD.

Serpico was shot in the face in 1971, during a drug arrest.

He claimed that his police partners did not protect him before

or after the shooting.

The bullet remains in his head today.

He lost the hearing in one ear.

 He left New York, roved through Europe for years and now

lives in

upstate New York.

He continues to lecture and write

about police corruption.

He lives very simply, according to locals, and does not appear

 to have gotten rich from the book or the

movie.

As in most research, an outsider will never know.

 Because of the drama and color in his

story, he is perhaps the most famous whistle-blower of the

20th Century.

The questions linger on.

Why is he the most famous cop of his generation?

Why did he blow the whistle on corruption?

 Did he

have other reasons for doing what he did?

Was he the saintly naive cop that the 1973 Sidney Lumet

movie 'Serpico' showed?

Or was he an opportunist who saw a way to cash in on his

painful life story?

 I was never an NYPD cop. So, that makes

me an outsider.

I cannot hope to penetrate the culture of 1960's NYPD from

where I am now.

But I can research these questions that fascinate me.

This video is a great help in that quest.

This video is well-done, objective and fills in some questions

about the story. Of course, it is shorter than the

1973 feature film.

But the video is a welcome companion piece to the film.

 To my eye, it seems more objective than the

film. It does not make Serpico a saint. Very few humans are.

This video balances the scales.

The video shows rare clips of the

real Serpico, speaking about his seven year campaign to

report corruption. As said, the NYPD, the Mayor's Office

and other agencies chose not to confront this unpopular

problem at that time.

Some condemned Serpico, called

him mentally ill, a subversive trying to ruin the NYPD or a

grafter covering his own tracks. Everyone had a different

opinion. They still do.

 When Serpico and Inspector DeLisle and Sgt. David Durk

came to the New York Times in 1970,

three other cops came with them.

The three unknowns supplied very little data.

But, to this day, they refuse to

identify themselves.

Even now, with most calling Serpico a hero, these three do not anyone to know who they are.

When Serpico came to speak at NYC Council meeting in 2000, the cops guarding it recognized his name and treated

him rudely because of it. The fear and animosity appear to linger on.

This video will lead you to a clearer understanding of the problems that Serpico faced and how he dealt with them.

It contains other precise interviews with characters in this saga. You will learn more about the sub-currents of feeling

raced through the NYPD and the city at that time. You will watch it and watch it again, enjoying this remarkable story.

It will interest anyone trying to understand ethics, be they police or civilian ethics.

As I am, you will be happy that someone made this video. And you will be glad that you watched it.

8101558,5,B000CS45ZG,He was more of a hero than the movie Serpico showed and more human too.  This biography is worth watching if you're interested in true crime and those men and women who fight for justice in our country.,1360022400,2,202,4.315789473684211
8101559,4,B000CS45ZG,"Frank Serpico blew the whistle on his own kind -- the police force -- in New York. Frank Serpico was the first police officer in the history of the New York City Police Department to step forward to report and subsequently testify openly about widespread, systemic corruption payoffs amounting to millions of dollars. The ensuing scandal made him a hero in some circles, and a pariah in others. A fictionalized account of his heroic efforts was presented in the movie ""Serpico"" with Al Pacino. This biography presents the true story of Frank Serpico, and how he struggled to get something done about the corruption and bribery that infected his law enforcement agency. Giving his story to the New York Times almost cost him his life, when disgruntled fellow officers refused to come to his aid when he was shot in the line of duty. Archival news clips, news stories, and personal recollections of those who knew him best tell the story of this courageous man. Learn more about his childhood, learn how he began his career in the NYPD, and learn how his life changed on February 3, 1971. This is the real story of a man who wanted to be an honest cop.

BIOGRAPHY-FRANK SERPICO: HONOR BOUND is a great documentary about one of the most interesting story of the 1970's. Mr. Serpico was interviewed for this documentary and it's great to see and hear the man behind this fascinating story. If you enjoy watching documentaries related to History or Law Enforcement then you'll enjoy watching this DVD. I highly recommend this DVD. This is better than watching the movie. This is the real story. :)
