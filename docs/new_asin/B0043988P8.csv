4254186,5,B0043988P8,"I haven't bought it yet, but I've seen the series.  For this price, having two seasons in a box set is an incredible deal.  This is a very smart and funny series, and I'll consider buying it as soon as I can.",1300406400,,208,3.9285714285714284
4254187,4,B0043988P8,"Tower of Druaga is an unusual series. I enjoyed it very much, but I think it can only be recommended to the right audience. If you like epic fantasy and enjoy laughing at cliches, you might be part of that audience. The series begins with a pilot episode that brilliantly spoofs the conventions of fantasy fiction, but there's a serious plot here, too.  Especially in the second season, there is a strong storyline which will keep you watching to find out what happens next. On the down side, much as I was invested in the developing plot of the second season, I found myself missing the comedy of the first season. Personally, I would have liked the show to continue the light touch with which it began. Part of what impressed me in the first season was the way that even the comic episodes could be used to seriously advance the plot or contribute to character development: they were NOT throw-a-way or breather episodes. However, I did find some of the relationship dynamics to be interesting, and these are developed most strongly in the second season. It's hard to criticize the show too heavily for trading the laughter for a little more depth, because the second season leads to a satisfying conclusion. I have to say, though, that the episodes I am most likely to rewatch are the comic ones from the first season.

This box set includes both seasons, plus the bonus episode, which is really required viewing, since characters occasionally make running gags that refer back to it. There aren't a ton of special features, but some of them are interesting (especially the very goofy commentary on one of the comic episodes). Overall, this box set is well worth buying if you enjoy a good laugh along with a good story.",1296691200,41,1723,4.683168316831683
4254188,5,B0043988P8,"Not much else to say here. The first season ends on a cliffhanger, but fortunately this has both seasons in it. The English dub, as mentioned, is decent - most of the cast is pulled over from the Baccano team - but with dual-audio, you can take it or leave it. Series gets a little darker toward the end as they amp up the seriousness so that the ending is that much more (pardon the term) epic. Overall, excellent series, highly recommended for fantasy fiction fans.

Don't compare it to Slayers, where the plot is secondary to the mindless goofing around (though Slayers is great too, don't get me wrong), it has more in common with Gurren Lagann, where the goal is the primary focus and any goofing around and sidequesting is secondary to it.",1295222400,3,745,4.518518518518518
4254189,3,B0043988P8,"The Tower of Druaga is a mysterious tower filled with riches and monsters and the god of evil residing at the top. Every 5 years, the Summer of Anu arrives and the monsters become weak. Jil and his friends are Climbers - people who climb the tower and whose goal is to defeat the evil god Druaga at the top and claim the mystical Blue Crystal Rod, which is said to have the power to grant wishes. But Jil and his friends aren't the only ones climbing the tower - there are many other groups of Climbers, and even the kingdom of Uruk sends its army to climb. The race is on!

I was first introduced to The Tower of Druaga through the Funimation preview, which impressed me by being an actual preview (unlike most anime trailers), and a good preview at that. When I found it was based on a video game, I wasn't sure if that was a bad thing or not, but when I heard favorable reviews of the series, I decided to give it a shot.

The first episode had me in stitches - it was a parody of RPG games, and was really well done and entertaining. The second episode is where the story really starts. The parody element continue to show up through out the series, though is most common in the first half. The story itself isn't bad, though full of plot holes. Stuff is thrown in with little explanation and anything important is mostly ignored as long as possible. The characters are flat, and Jil is horribly annoying. The rest are just a little annoying. And if you expect a cool ending where everything comes together and all is explained, keep dreaming.

But for all of its many, many shortcomings, Tower of Druaga was fun to watch. The Tower has lots of cool things about it and I enjoyed the references to Babylonian mythology. I finished the first half of the series slightly impressed. Unfortunately, the second half falls back into mediocrity. The sparkle of the first half wears away, and we are left with plot holes and flat characters. There is a convenient break in the story after the first half, so if you wanted to stop there, you could. Though I admit that the beginning of the second half was rather fun, getting to see what happened to our heros after they finished their quest and all.

As for this box set, I expect it to be like all of Funimation's complete collection releases - good quality for a good price. The Amazon page for this product claims that it is 2 discs and 260 minutes, which is probably copied from the product details of the second half of the complete collection. That is, its wrong. This set will have 4 discs in two thin-pack cases and 24 episodes, which is about 560 minutes of runtime. I've heard a little of the English dub, enough to decided that it is pretty good, I just like the Japanese dub better.

If you are looking for random, pointless fun, The Tower of Druaga might be your show. The complete collection is fair deal, much better then buying the halves separately. If you just want to try it out before committing a whole $36.99, Crunchyroll.com has the entire series streaming for free (or at least at the time of this review it was).",1289865600,19,3083,4.401754385964912

4254199,1,B0043988P8,"Unfortunately, The Tower of Druaga is an ultimately bad series. That is not to say that individual episodes are bad in and of themselves, it is just that when viewed together, the poor writing pours through. I initially saw the preview and thought that this would be a great gritty series, and then I watched the first episode (which is sadly the best). The first episode, through the guise of satire, actually lays out the plot to the entire series, it contains several laugh out loud moments which trigger again as coincidences appear in the later series. As soon as the series returned to the gritty story line (which I had wanted) I now found myself longing for the comedy of the first episode. The problem was that the rest of the series was not as good at drama as the first episode was at comedy.

The legend of Gilgamesh and the Tower of Babyl are the foundations for this story (and the foundations for the game which this is based on), however little is done to relate or develop the origin stories of Gilgamesh or of the tower, One could be a Ph. D. in Ancient Sumerian and Babylonian myths, and not a single thing in this story would mirror what you already knew, with the exceptions of the names of Gilgamesh, Ishtar, and the kingdom of Uruk (One plot to the 5,000 year old epic of Gilgamesh is actually about Gilgamesh's quest for immortality, which is technically in this series, but it is assumed rather than developed).

To the problems with the series;
  Plot;
1. The series rapidly switches from underdevelopment to deus ex machina in order to complete story arcs, this naturally breaks the suspension of disbelief. In particular, the four coffins of Pizzuzu remain the first series' most interesting feature, but they are a Chekov's Gun that isn't fired when it counts (much to my disappointment). The second series tries to retconn this error by showing the coffin's contents in action, the only problem is the audience very clearly sees the that the coffins never opened in the first series (no alternate explanations are offered as to how this came about). These golems actually have a very interesting minor arc. One of these golems is very skilled with a sword, and as a golem like creature it is nigh indestructible (as brought up in the series), why then can a character (who has no experience with a sword) so easily kill it for its sword for a fight against another nigh indestructible with a sword (which the first party loses). 2. A certain character is presumed to have been killed at two different points in the story to the audience's perspective, the first time it is ambiguous, but there's no way he survived the second incident. 3. The assassination plotline went nowhere fast, and would have made more sense in the second series if more time had been spent developing it in the first. 4. The betrayal(s) that everyone saw coming (and the one that no one saw coming) were irritating examples of bad writing on both spectrums of development. 5. Fraternity issues. A hidden malice is revealed in the last episode which is inconsistent with the rest of the series and feels like a cheep shot to the time invested in it. 6. All other things being equal Pizzuzu's intentions become oddly vindicated when one realizes that his evil goal in the first series is everyone's justified goal in the second series.
  Character Development;
Most of the characters lack personality, they all have behaviors, but none really have a developed personality barring Jil and Fantina. Jil and Fantina are supposed to be two parts of two different love triangles, and while the series can't develop their relationships with the third member in their triangles, it also refuses to develop their relationship past the first three episodes of the second series. It's a missed opportunity really, as the set up was quite good. All other characters are very simple behavior sets that work on stimulus-response patterns and the series just becomes a disappointment to the viewer, particularly in the second series. Let's talk about Jil, it is irritating that he is constantly unable to be inspiring when asked the dramatic questions in the first series ""What would you do?"", or the dramatic question of the second series, ""Why should I go on?"" in fact his response to that second one is so bad that the viewer wonders if the writers were even trying.

Finally the last episode of the show, and indeed the last few minutes of the second to last episode demonstrate such an astounding lack of development in writing that it makes you hate yourself for watching the series to begin with.

I would not recommend this show to a friend or a normal person, but I would highly recommend this show to my enemies and fans of Lost.",1434499200,,4728,4.722424242424243

4254203,3,B0043988P8,"This show started off as a bit of a disappointment for me. I wanted to relive the nostalgic, magical feelings that permeated me when I viewed ""Sword Art Online"" for the first time. However, the conflict was lighthearted, the characters (excluding the mage and his apprentice) were uninteresting, and even the world was bland. I was on the verge of being bored to tears. I suppose I could mention the comedy, which stands out on some levels, but by no means does it save the trudging plot when it finds itself knee-deep in mud. I almost gave up, but thank goodness I persevered! ACT II is far more interesting, mystical, emotional, and mesmerizing. It definitely resembled Sword Art Online in its presentation, even if the plot and characters were nothing alike. Speaking of the plot, it thickens intensely in the second half, and practically everything improves: the characters' personalities begin to shine, the world expands and flourishes in ominous beauty, the conflicts grow in magnitude and emotional weight, and one can become easily grabbed by that which failed to do so the first time around. The atmosphere also spiked, and I was completely engrossed in the perilous journey that the almost redefined characters now found themselves taking. I was very much impressed to witness the growth amongst the characters both individually and as a group, even though it was sad to see this progress completely wiped clean after the climax. Speaking of which, the anime ends on a somewhat questionable note, but I have a difficult time discerning whether I find it anti-climactic or just too muddled to take seriously. Nevertheless, I was satisfied, and dub it a hidden gem. The two aspects that were irredeemable, however, were the music and animation. Not that they were bad, per say, but they didn't stand out in the slightest and definitely matched the confused and bland tone of the first half of the series. Definitely worth at least one watch, even if you have to duck your head to plow through the first half. You will be pleasantly relieved as soon as soon as those 6 months pass in the fantasy world. I give The Tower of Druaga a weary, but grateful, recommendation; take my word as you see fit.",1421193600,,2205,4.835978835978836

4254208,5,B0043988P8,"This series does something that is hard to achieve with most stories. It hits the exactly the mixture of seriousness and comedy. The story itself is a serious one - it's set in a tower created by an evil deity and filled with monsters. Every person climbing the tower has their own goals ranging from simply getting rich to making a name for themselves or even, in our hero's case, slaying Druaga himself just because its the right thing to do. The risks are real, characters come close to death and actually do die, leaving other characters to cope with the loss. On the other side of the coin though, is the humor. The story often makes fun of tropes common to fantasy games and stories with very entertaining results. Fantasy game fans will definitely appreciate the humor when the groups run across traps that have ridiculous effects or our hero has to conquer a tower within the tower with someone else controlling him like a game. However this humor does not detract from the seriousness of the story, but rather enhances the overall experience.
I would strongly recommend this series to anyone, even if you aren't a fan of anime. It's a well told story with good characters that I think anyone can enjoy.",1403913600,2,1211,4.637209302325582

This is based on a series of RPG and video games, none of which I am familiar with. It works perfectly
well as a stand-alone story. You've got your mysterious Babel-like soaring-into-the-clouds tower,
roamed by monsters, which has to be traversed level by level. Most of the ""climbers"" go in seeking
treasure, but a few seek to battle the evil god up at the very top.
Todd voices the usual schmuck, roped into doing this by the usual pretty face, accompanied by a
band of your usual stock characters. The story works well. The plot becomes impressively intricate
for a video-game adaptation. You've got the once-heroic king who may not be all that heroic, court
factions, political intrigues. They certainly did a good job of creating a medieval who-is-looking-to-
stick-a-dagger-in-whose-back-next atmosphere.
I should note that there are a......gratuitous?....number of bath scenes. The women in the story

has strengths and weaknesses, and their interactions with one another add to the
story. The English dub is also one of the best I've encountered, the cast a who's-who
of top voice actors.
The story has it all: Courage and cowardice, sacrifice and betrayal, alliances that form
and reform until the very end. Very little is predictable, the twists and turns of the plot
feeling a lot like a white-water river-rafting expedition.
There is just enough comedy included to keep the story from getting too dark. This is
always a delicate balancing act for script-writers, but is very well done here.
The story is nicely wrapped up too--you never get the impression that there needs to
be another season (or two) to finish the saga.
