8197108,2,B000QRIKG8,"An interesting report, but my gripe is about the very misleading description and the price. It is only 8 minutes long, which makes it about $2.00 per minute. There are no additional stories at all as the description claims. This was the case with another 20/20 DVD that I bought from Amazon.",1341619200,4,291,4.615384615384615
