632845,1,6303387810,"I read the book and looked forward to sharing the video with my husband.  His comment was ""I am sure the book was much better"".  I told him it was.  Don't waste your time.  Read the book instead - it is really good!",1277424000,,215,3.9302325581395348

632847,5,6303387810,"This highly successful tv-miniseries is perhaps the one that ignited the success of the miniseries genre. Although, there are others who came before this, it was RAGE OF ANGELS who ignited the ""mania."" Of course, there was Richard Chamberlain starring in all those other successful miniseries based on books and him as a King of the genre but it was Jaclyn Smith's ""Jennifer Parker""  that gave the glitter and excitement and that finally,a woman is about to claim a throne and she really shine in this beautifully adapted version of Sidney Sheldon's novel.
All of a sudden, people started rushing to read and re-read the book and even the video released during the 80's was a big hit. People who have seen the movie on tv wanted to get a copy and you can hear people talking about the movie during lunch time or coffee break.
Ive never seen Jaclyn Smith more beautiful and her on-screen chemistry with Ken Howard is probably one of the sexiest that has emerged in the small screen for a long time.
This one is a worthy addition to your collection.",1062720000,26,1047,4.629032258064516
