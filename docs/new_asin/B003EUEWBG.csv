8395642,5,B003EUEWBG,"I love this anime - and this does happen to be my favorite season of it.

I appreciate that they returned to 20-minute episode format instead of continuing the story in OVAs, as they were doing with the third season.  Oddly, season four saw the sedate, classical opening theme of previous seasons replaced with a happy little pop song. It took me a while to get used to! It's actually rather funny, given that (depending on the translation you're watching) the intro always states that girls at Lillian walk calmly/slowly so as not to ruffle their pleated skirts.  However, the new opening shows the girls running around the campus, and... teleporting??  If you've watched all the previous seasons, this change might surprise you too.

Maria-sama ga Miteru mostly focuses on its characters' relationships more than being beholden to an outside plot structure or greater purpose, so tension in the relationship of the uptight Sachiko and the anxious Yumi - or any character plus another - tends to be present in any season as the source of drama. Here, the tension is between Yumi and her potential petite soeur, Touko, but there are still intimate sisterly moments with Sachiko and Yumi.  Seeing all the rose families continue to blossom (I am fond of them all) and Yumi come into her own as a grande soeur-to-be is really lovely, after all she's been through in her time as Sachiko's petite soeur, struggling. It shows a wonderful growth of her character's increasing confidence.

It's such a crying shame that the show stopped here.  Sometimes when an anime keeps going beyond its natural lifespan, it can become tiresome rehashing, but this is one anime I wouldn't mind seeing continue because the storyline is so natural.  But this ending doesn't leave one unsatisfied, either.",1381104000,,1781,4.929765886287625
8395643,3,B003EUEWBG,"Maria Watches Over Us (Maria-sama ga Miteru, Marimite) is one of those shows where you can't help but watch it, even though you might be completely embarrassed to admit that to other people. It's like when the husbands of women who chase telenovelas claim their wives are forcing them to watch Marisol pull Carmelita's hair for the nth time when they secretly enjoy watching the girlfights over Antonio. The main difference being... there are no fights in Maria. At least, not physical ones. The show is girl drama in its finest form, down to over-analyzing each other and attempting to read peoples' minds in the process. I might sound like a Maria hater, but I'm not. In fact, I have watched all three previous seasons and I am a fan of the series. Unfortunately, this one was a big disappointment.

Before I start, I do want to say that Nozomi Entertainment once again did a great job with the packaging, translation, different subtitle tracks with honorifics, etc.

About the actual show: the production values seem to be lower for the fourth season. The animation isn't as clean in some places and there are some obvious gaffes (ex. Shimako's hair curiously changes lengths during one of the episodes). The quality just isn't on par with the previous seasons. The new opening theme sounds awful in comparison to the old one. Instead of the original, more classical-sounding opening theme (with beautiful vocals), they have replaced it with a crappy Japanese bubblegum pop song. To be fair, the writing is still solid, and the voice actresses still put forth an awesome job.

LITE SPOILERS AHEAD

***

In terms of the plot/story, it has become a mess. Conflicts seem to erupt randomly and are solved almost instantaneously. It's hard to get into detail without spoiling the season, but what was really disturbing was how Hanako's depression and hatred of men was suddenly resolved in episode 2. Let me just put it this way: I'm not sure that it's a positive message for young girls, who I am guessing are the main audience for the show.

Aside from the overarching drama between Yumi and Touko, this season really seems to lack direction. The show can't seem to figure out what it wants to do. For example, the growing relationship between Yumi and Sachiko is not explored very well. Overall, it seems like they're growing closer, but this focus is largely inconsistent and in the background for most of the season. Kashiwagi shows up randomly for the fangirls, I'm guessing. Popular characters like Sei and Youko make very brief appearances and are underutilized during their cameos. In short, this season, it's all about Yumi and Touko. Which would be fine except for two reasons. First, the series has always had a ""big"" conflict with little conflicts occurring in the foreground. Usually this tension is balanced well - instead, this season, it creates a meandering narrative. Two, and maybe it's just me, but Touko is obnoxious. She isn't cute, she isn't likable, and the way Yumi handles her drama with Touko was even more irritating.

For the ultimate fans, you're probably going to watch this no matter what I say. If you're new to the series, I would highly recommend starting with any of the other seasons instead. I just wanted to get the word out that this season isn't as good as the previous ones; the noticeably lower production values and uneven plotting was a let-down. If they end up making a season 5, I hope they take some notes from the first three seasons and do a better job.",1342569600,,3502,4.788079470198675
8395644,4,B003EUEWBG,I think that Maria Watches over Us is a cut above most anime in plot and content. It shows there is no need for fan service to make a great show. My only complaint is that I would like to see another season to have more closer.,1317340800,4,227,3.851063829787234
8395645,5,B003EUEWBG,"Trust me if you want a good clean wholesome story buy this. Great for adults/young adults. A must see for a drama fanatic.

Warning this is only in Japanese with english subtitles, but like I said earlier it is well worth it.",1303862400,5,225,4.357142857142857
