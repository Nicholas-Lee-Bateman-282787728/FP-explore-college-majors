8289638,4,B001CUAZ7U,"I was impressed with this video about how LBJ and RFK failed to get along.
I think they just got off on the wrong foot in the beguinning.
So much could have been different.
LBJ Respected RFK's Abilities, but RFK had no respect for LBJ.
That's what happens when you think you are better than everyone else.
What is strange is that on the surface they seemed to get a long well judging by
their phone conversations. It was what they talked about to others that was the opposite.
LBJ was probably the most powerful person to ever hold that office in history.
He had the ability to get things done.  RFK was super Envious of him for that I guess, and
LBJ was envious of the Kennedy's education and standing in public.
Too bad.  So much could have been done and done sooner if not for their personality problems.",1355184000,,807,4.373333333333333
