4498525,5,B004XZ99SM,"I happened upon this flick completely by accident while searching for monster puppets on Amazon. Having a life-long interest in puppets & puppetry the title & cover intrigued me, the other reviews hooked me, and the film itself reeled me in! My hat is off to Mr. Mills for creating this fantastic and ingeniusly twisted gem. If you love '80's horror flicks, gore, monsters, mad Nazis, and, of course, puppets--then you've gotta see this! It's worth every penny! I hope Mr. Mills turns a profit on this great little flick, 'cause I can't wait to see what he does next!",1313539200,,567,4.68
4498526,5,B004XZ99SM,"One of the best films I've seen all year... no kidding.

It's movies like this -- made almost entirely by one dedicated, half-crazed guy in his living room -- that remind me the best movies are about personality, love, and dedication... sticking to your vision and creating it to the best of your abilities, even if nobody else thinks it's worthwhile.  And Dustin Wayde Mills succeeded in entertaining me more with his screwball movie than just about every other ""big"" film did this year.

Puppet Monster Massacre has no illusions about itself and makes no attempt to hide any shortcomings behind a glossy wall of CGI or overdone explosions -- it revels in its 80's horror roots and is clearly having a ball doing it.  There's an honesty and authenticity to this film you don't see in a lot of big budget films... this movie wasn't made to satisfy the accountants, it was made to entertain the hell out of you!

And boy, does it EVER!

Boobs, blood, profanity, messy deaths, a scheming mad scientist, Nazi references, tanks, rampaging monsters, a perverted grandfather, dead teenagers, revenge -- it's ALL here!  PMM runs only a little over an hour, and gives you a lean, hilarious trip back to the days when horror movies didn't take themselves too seriously or tried to be hip with little nudge-nudge, wink-wink moments... it is what it is, and Mr. Mills has succeeded brilliantly in crafting a horror comedy that'll make you go ""oh my GAWD! LOOK AT THAT!"" and then laugh out loud.

If you're not a fan of 80's horror movies or bloody puppet extravaganzas, this isn't going to change your mind any... but if you like sitting in front of the TV with the lights off while watching old favorites like Fright Night and the Monster Squad (or even Meet The Feebles), this is right up your alley.

What really impressed me was with how sharp, clean, and well-executed the film was... I tend to forgive indie films for being a bit sloppy, because that's the nature of the beast, but PMM is VERY well put-together.

A friend showed me this movie, and I loved it so much I went out and bought it myself -- not only because I want to support this kind of zany, imaginative, and ridiculous filmaking, but also because I'm REALLY hoping for Mr. Mills to visit another beloved 80's horror trope... the sequel.

Watch it, laugh yourself stupid, and remember that a good movie doesn't always have a big budget attached to it... sometimes dudes can make magic in their living rooms with nothing but puppets and a sense of humor.  Well-done, Mr. Mills.",1312502400,2,2536,4.648769574944072
4498527,5,B004XZ99SM,"ThIS is a film for anyone that remembers ""Meet The Feebles,"" filmmaker Dustin Mills has created a comedy/horror that is so wrong it's great. It's ""Sesame Street gone bad"" but in a highly entertaining way. The story takes place in 1985 and it's main character is a wimpy little kid named Charlie who lives with his foul-mouthed grandfather. Charlie has a dream of opening back up the family dime store, one day several other Teenagers in town and himself receive an invitation to spend the night at an old mansion owned by the infamous Doctor Wagner. They are promised to share one million dollars if they can stay the night but the mad Doctor has plans he's been waiting to put into motion for a long time, the mansion might be haunted by this group of Teenagers have something a bit more deathly to worry about. To go into any more details about the story would only ruin it for those wanting to see it so that is about as deep into the plot as I am going to go.

The film is very well made and has some hilarious and memorable moments as well as plenty of action, blood effects and lets not forget about the language, yes this is an adult puppet film so be sure to watch this one when the little ones are not around. The use of animation with the puppets works great together, the animated scene when the Doctor is explaining his past is very well done and memorable.

""Puppet Monster Massacre"" is a unique independent gem full of great visuals a good story that isn't too complicated and plenty of adult humor. So if you're an indie fan or just looking for something different to watch I highly recommend picking this up, it was so much fun I went back and watched it a second time already. It's not a horror movie designed to scare people, it's instead a hilarious and highly entertaining film that brings back memories of those those great movies we saw in the 80's, a homage yes but it stands on it's own as a future cult classic.",1312502400,2,1936,4.389972144846797
4498528,5,B004XZ99SM,"Thats all there is to say. Pick up the movie, watch it. Enjoy. I can promise you that you will remember this fun little low budget flick for years to come and you will talk your friends into watching it. Trust me on this!",1312329600,,221,4.045454545454546
4498529,5,B004XZ99SM,"How often do you get to say, ""I was a fan before he was famous.""  Well, here's your chance, because director Dustin Mills has raised the bar, and then set it on fire with a low budget film that offers visuals that glow brighter than a pack of emo vampires at a tanning salon.  You know you have a secret desire to see Elmo get his throat ripped out by Kermit The Frog.  Sorry, but that will never happen.  Thankfully, The Puppet Monster Massacre delivers the sweet, sweet puppet gore that you have been praying for.  This movie has it all.  Mad Scientists, determined soldiers, epic monsters, and ginormous rooms filled to the rafters with deadly farting rabbits. Endless laughs await you in the dark and twisted world of The Puppet Monster Massacre.  Can't wait to say, ""I was into Mills' horror films BEFORE he made 20 Million a picture and became a total Hollywood a-hole.""",1312156800,3,876,4.576923076923077
4498530,5,B004XZ99SM,"...okay, maybe more than a few blocks.  This one definitely isn't for today's kids, perhaps more so for kids of the MTV generation.  A near-perfect homage to 80s monster horror, the Puppet Monster Massacre manages to take puppets where they've never gone before.  And it works!  Dustin Mills uses special effects, animation, and of course puppetry, to tell his story in a truly unique, interesting, and creative way--something most films of late are critically lacking.  Perhaps most importantly, there's plenty of laughs amid the ""horror,"" making this film more than just a simple tribute to those 80s flicks we've become so nostalgic for.  Ultimately, Puppet Monster Massacre is a surefire way to ensure your next movie night is the most fun you've had with puppets (well, I hope that's the most fun you've had with puppets...but who knows what you do in your free time).",1311638400,5,873,4.9862068965517246

4498532,4,B004XZ99SM,"Actually, Puppet Monster Massacre is a damn good film that acts as a love letter to 80s-style horror with an adults-only brand of humor that borders on Meet the Feebles territory tempered by a Mad Monster Party premise. Even without the elaborate sequences of Feebles, Mills and his team managed to create a pretty close approximation of a fully-realized world with subplots and supporting characters that really flesh out the characters. Speaking of which, the film finds a group of teens who have been invited to a creepy mansion by Dr. Wolfgang Wagner who is preparing to unleash the forces of hell upon our world via a demon of his own creation.

This House on Haunted Hill setup is only one of many Easter Eggs scattered throughout the film by Dustin, who also portrays The Hunter, The Sarge and (perhaps my favorite character of the entire movie) Raimi. As you might expect from looking at him Raimi is the hapless nerd of the film and a huge horror fan- he also happens to be one of the most entertaining characters of the whole cast. Other notable characters include the Aussie-accented Iggy and Gramps, though they are all pretty memorable. The only character I didn't like (ironically) is our ""hero"" Charlie who may or may not be a reference to Fright Night and acts as our point of view for the majority of the movie.

As you might expect, the teens are picked off one by one as Wolfgang's scheme reveals itself and, I must admit, Charlie does make up for all his whining in a big way towards the end which validates his weak-willed personality. The voice work is also noteworthy with Steve Rimpici hamming it up as the ""mad"" Dr. Wolfgang Wagner and Bart Flynn double timing it as both Iggy and Gramps. The female voice work was a little weaker, Jessica Daniels (Gwen) and Erica Kisseberth (Mona) lack some of the emotional range of Rimpici and Flynn, but still hold their own remarkably well throughout the film. By the time the credits roll we've seen hails of bullets flying, puppet decapitations and disembowelments aplenty and a giant monster rampaging around- very cool.",1309478400,5,2087,4.730769230769231

Then again, like myself, you could always have movie night over at a friend's house if you have little ones. Once past that fact, I heartily recommend this film as a purchase.

The film is an excellent blend of comedy and classic horror the likes of which keep us coming back to watch such films as ""Wishmaster"" & ""Army of Darkness"" (as just a couple examples) over and over again. Any fan of 80's-style horror needs to buy this film and watch it.

8447709,5,B004XZ99SM,"Charlie Hawkins (Ethan Holey) receives a letter informing him that he will win one million dollars, if he can spend one night in the infamous Wagner mansion. Unbeknownst to Charlie, the eeevil Wolfgang Wagner (Steve Rimpici) carried out his nefarious experiments in the mansion's laboratory in 1985, and brought forth a parasitic monster! Now, Charlie, along w/ a group of other unsuspecting teens, must survive the night in order to collect their prize. Horror and CGI splatter ensue. THE PUPPET MONSTER MASSACRE is an utterly ridiculous homage to monster movies, done entirely w/ puppets. Obviously, this is a comedy, and it succeeds very well in causing laughs. Sort of like THE MUPPETS on Meth, the humor is suitably raunchy, and the characters are about as silly as one would expect. The whole production must have cost less than most digital cameras, and only runs a tad over an hour. In other words, before it can get too tedious, it's over! Beware! The makers of this film are not above the use of fart jokes! Or actual farts! Several times! Even bunny farts!

8447710,4,B004XZ99SM,"Personally, I was a little disappointed with this film, I thought it would be funnier then what it was (I was expecting ""Meet the Feebles,"" but obviously without a big budget). Despite the initial disappointment, all in all, I did like the film, and I would watch it again.
PROS AND CONS LIST:
Pros:
(1) the story was entertaining enough, and for the most part held my interest. The movie was basically about a mad German Nazi scientist who created a monster, and he wanted to feed it people.
(2) All the backgrounds seemed to be done by CG/Green Screen, and it was done very well. In the past I've seen several independent films where green screen was used, but wasn't done well/ didn't look right/ didn't look real. For EXAMPLE the actors might have had a brighter lighting, but would stand out (too much) from the darker settings/backgrounds. However, that is not the same case with this puppet movie. In this film the puppets and the background (lighting/coloring) complemented each other very well. It looked real enough for what the movie was about/contained.
(3) The voices for the puppets (excluding one or two) were done very well. They emoted the proper emotions for different scenes. Most of the voice actors gave their specific puppets their own personalities.
CONS:
(1) There were a lot of jokes, which revolved around farting and pooping (this can be a pro or a con depending on your tastes). Some of these jokes were funny, but there were also times I had said to myself, ""god, another fart joke...really?""
(2) The entire cast consisted of puppets, and not real people, there were very few facial/ body gestures, which expressed emotions...only the puppets' voices conveyed emotions/moods. Due to this fact, I felt that the director should have done more shots from varying angles or close ups, or far shots, or medium shots, etc. This would have at least changed the view for the audience, so that it wasn't so obvious that the audience was just watching a movie about poorly constructed puppets. I hate to say it, but more editing (close ups, far shots, etc) would have helped the believiblity of the puppets/ helped me to stay more focused during certain scenes. Not just watching two puppets having a conversation, while the film would cut back and forth to the two puppets in the same position/camera angle as it was at the beginning of their conversation. AND YES I AM AWARE that this is a movie about puppets/audience is suppose to know they're puppets. However, the changes I had written above would have helped the film in moving along more smoothly.
(3) I felt at times they should have added more sound effects and music into specific scenes. This would have helped the story even more so/ held my attention longer during specific scenes.
There are other pros and cons, but this movie hinges on what is your taste in movies? This movie can be entertaining, but at the same time it can also come across a little boring, aquard, and lacking true charm. However, it's not a bad movie, but not a great one either. Also, there are a couple of sex scene (nothing x-rated) in this film. Pretty much all that was seen were a pair of felt looking breasts, accompanied by the sounds of moaning. If you want to see a true x-rated puppet movie watch ""Let My Puppets Come.""
Would I buy this movie again???? Yes I would, but not at a high price.
Below are some of the jokes from the movie (SPOILER ALERT) to help you in gaging if this film is right for you:
(1) In one scene the nerdy character continued to say ""what is that"" and all that could be seen was furniture. However, there was one time where he said ""what is that"" and the audience saw the monster. The nerdy character then did an elongated fart. The fart was so long, and I guess stinky, that the monster had thrust it's head back ...almost as if he was saying ""WTF?""
(2) The main character was stuck in a room full of rabbits (the monster's secondary food). The boy first talked about how cute the rabbits were, but then the bunnies began farting. The boy then said, ""Oh, it smells like carrots and poop!""
(3) The boy's grandfather talked about how in WW2 he kicked Hitler in his ""ding ding,"" and also how he screwed the boys grandmother ""six ways from Sunday.""",1406419200,,4236,4.604497354497354
8447711,3,B004XZ99SM,"A weird, weird little movie. Spoofs 80's horror conventions, but the jokes are inconsistently funny. Some gags are hysterical, others fall very flat. It's comparable to 'Meet the Feebles' but not quite as inspired or funny.",1395964800,,223,5.222222222222222
8447712,4,B004XZ99SM,"Every once in a while you hear about a movie for us horror fans that is so different and strangely put together that you can't believe that it would be any good. You can't imagine that the idea would make any sense. All the good ideas have been taken already right? Well, no... you'd be wrong. This movie lets us know that although Hollywood may be fresh out of ideas, independent cinema is just warming up with new and inventive ways to scare us and make us laugh, all at the same time.

The Puppet Monster Massacre. Seventy minutes of great entertainment that has you begging for more, or at least a sequel by the time the end credits roll. But this is not the type of movie that is built to put out forty-five more parts to it. This is the old fashioned style flick that has everything you want wrapped up in its running time. A movie you'll watch more than once, wishing there were more, but glad there isn't at the same time. So what makes this an odd movie? Well... puppets. That's right. Ever wish that the Muppets would do a horror movie? If so, this is for you.

The story is set in 1985. An evil scientist named Wagner and his pet penguin have created a monster in their old mansion. The more the monster eats, the more it grows. Wagner wants more food for his creation, So he sends letters out to four of the towns teenagers for their chance to win a million dollars by spending a night in the mansion. So far we already have references to House On Haunted Hill, Frankenstein, and strangely Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.

Charlie Hawkins is one of the teens that gets a letter. He lives with his grandfather Jonathan, and tells him that he'll re-open the old dime store if he wins the money. He has a crush on a girl in town, Gwen, who also receives a letter, and tells charlie that they should go to the mansion together. Raimi Campbell (Who makes the movie in my opinion) is a human movie reel reference, also receives a letter along with tough guy Iggy, whose girlfriend Mona just happens to tag along.

Everything is set up perfectly for a showdown between the teens, the evil doctor and his monster. To give away more plot would be ruining the film for you. Raimi will more than likely be your favorite character in the film, as his constant references to fright films is hilarious. And his tendency to be scared out of his wits by everything that moves (or not) keeps you laughing. One of the things I never thought I'd ever see (or ever think about seeing for that matter) is a topless Muppet (puppet?). Well, that's taken care of on several occasions by our sexy Mona, who has quite a steamy shower scene.

And to top off the humor, we have some fart jokes. Damn, I love fart jokes! And they find good uses for them here on several accounts. The backgrounds of the film look like they came from a video game. While that may not bother anyone, there are times when it looks quite cheap (interiors of the mansion), and others where it looks fantastic (night time exteriors). I imagine some of the backgrounds are CGI as well. Most all of the blood are CGI effects, and as a whole the effects and backgrounds suit our puppet friends just fine.

The extras included on this disc are two commentaries, one from the director, and one with both the director and assistant director. There are also two discarded monster designs for us to have a look at as well. If you're a horror movie buff, you need to get this film, just for the references alone. If you just want to have some fun watching a different type of horror film, this movie is your ticket out of the Hollywood doldrums, and into independent movie bliss. 8/10.",1372032000,,3639,4.399702823179792

This link above is my review of Dustin Mills' movies.  While I only mention Puppet Monster Massacre you'll get a good idea about his style in general.  Enjoy!",1337212800,,165,4.620689655172414
8447715,4,B004XZ99SM,"Insanity. Betrayal. Blood. Sex. Puppets.

For the better part of 12 years, Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles was the answer when asked what film incorporated all of these elements in a way that toed the line between respectable and ridiculous, and worked to entertain an audience.

While Jackson did not continue with the awkward puppet film genre, he did pave the way for puppets to be more than just innocent entertainment for children. He inspired some filmmakers to continue this underground legacy of puppet sex and violence. One of those filmmakers was Dustin Mills, with his feature film The Puppet Monster Massacre.

Dr. Wolfgang Wagner runs the local mad scientist lab in this all-too generic town. To feed his monstrous creation, Dr. Wagner invites a group of teenagers to survive the night in his creepy mansion in order to win $1 million(Yes, very House on Haunted Hill, as one of the characters mentions in the film).

There's Iggy, the token Englishman; Mona, the nude puppet-girl Iggy is ""copulating"" with when he receives his letter; Raimi, horror movie fan-boy with moveable zits; Gwen, the girl next door; and Charlie, the oblivious wimp that has the most back-story and therefore will probably save the day.

One by one they are picked off in Dr. Wagner's mansion until Charlie's war-vet grandfather, Gramps, who punched Adolf Hitler in his ding-ding, comes to save the day.

The plot of the movie is very straightforward. From the beginning, you know Dr. Wagner has bad intentions as he sicks his killer penguin on unsuspecting forest-dwellers. Even the grand revelation at the end is not a twist so much as a plot device to see more animated carnage, as puppets go back in time to become construction paper cut-outs. Probably the biggest twists are that Mona doesn't sleep with Raimi, and the secret of Iggy the Englishman.

This lack of plot twists works for this film because, let's face it, we are not watching debased puppets cursing, grinding, and dying for some grand plot. This movie was made for a particular audience, and to complicate a plot too much would take away from the puppet visuals we are all enthralled by. The voice acting, storyline, frame sequences are all fine for what this movie's feature is; a horror movie with puppets.

The one disappointing thing about the movie was the use of animated backdrops. While The Muppets and The Feebles both used live-action film sites, this movie was almost, if not all, green screen. This was most likely a budgeting issue so it is unfair to judge too harshly on how the backgrounds were set up, but there was a loss of that satirical spirit that Meet The Feebles invoked. At the same time, the CGI blood and gore worked surprisingly well in this movie, so you take the good with the bad.

All the same, it was an entertaining, must-see movie that toed the line between respectable and ridiculous for the entertainment of all.

I give this movie 3-1/2 out of 5 Feebles.",1325203200,,2950,4.812252964426878
8447716,2,B004XZ99SM,"Well, I first heard about this flick when I was flipping through last month's edition of Fangoria.  The review inside was on the mediocre side, but I thought for the right price I would give it a shot.  I did.  I was bored.  I fell asleep.  I restarted and finished the flick and wished I hadn't wasted the sixteen bucks!!!!!

This is the ideal type of film for someone like me.  It's a love letter to the monster movies of the mid 80's.  Full of sex, nudity, graphic violence, rediculous plots....but done with felt puppets ala a really low rent version of The Muppets.  This should've been a time specific funny black movie on the level of Peter Jackson's brilliant Meet the Feebles.  It's not.  The jokes are bargain bin used and not very ambitious above bodily humor and cheap sex jokes.  All of these would be fine in my book if there were other types of jokes and they were more clever. They're not.  They stay the same and the same they are.  Over and over again for one hour and ten minutes.

Also, I found the staging to be quite boring.  Literally, one puppet talks and then we cut to another and they talk.  Over and over and over again.  The film is very visually stale which is weird, despite it's low budget, they only had puppets that could do anything, and computer generated backgrounds that could be anything.  I've made really low budget films and they looked more visually stimulating than this.

The puppet designs with the exception of the film's alien-like monster are all pretty dull.  There are no real characters but rather cliche'd characters from the 80's slasher movie character store.  Again, this would be all good if the filmmakers took a stand or a funny edge to them, but they don't.  The plot is a mix between Mad Monster Party, Ali?n, and House on Haunted Hill(either original or remake), so why not go more out of control.  This movie oddly keeps its characters and plot very stale as opposed to doing something crazy or wild like Meet the Feebles or even Team America.  Despite the wacky premise this film is very 'safe'.

I appreciate what the film was trying to do, and I love the idea of the film using puppets, but this is no masterpiece unfortunately.  The dvd itself has only a couple of special features.  First we get two nixed creature desings that are neat, and then we get two audio commentaries, one of the director solo and the other of the director with his assistant.  I didn't listen to either due to me being bored and unsatisfied with the film.  If I had hated this film more, then it would've been neat to listen to the commentary kind of like the commentaries to Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.  Both of those movies are absolutely the worst of big Hollywood but the commentaries somehow make them both worth owning for their hilarity(sometimes from the director's sincerity and others because actors like Ben Affleck make fun of the film the whole running time).

So, there you have it.  The gimmick of an R rated puppet film might get people to view this, but it's nowhere near as good as something like Meet the Feebles or Team America.  So, I say if you dig this or like the idea it's a better idea to rent the other two films mentioned and really see where and by how much these filmmakers missed the mark.  I mean, i fell asleep in about 45 minutes of a one hour and ten minute film!!!!  That's really boring!!!!!  I still am shocked that after I woke up I decided to watch the rest......",1316908800,4,3449,4.478330658105939
