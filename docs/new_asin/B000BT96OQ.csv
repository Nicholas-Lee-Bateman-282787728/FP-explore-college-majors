2441244,1,B000BT96OQ,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS OF JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAREER.  THE STORY IS SO TRITE AND THE ACTING IS BAD.  WHOEVER THINKS THAT THIS WAS ONE OF MANSFIELD'S BEST EFFORTS DOESN'T GIVE HER ABILITY MUCH CREDIT.TO SEE AT LEAST A PROMISE OF POTENTIAL, ONE SHOULD SEE MANSFIELD IN THE WAYWARD BUS.",1273968000,2,312,4.654545454545454
2441245,3,B000BT96OQ,"So cool! So different! Cameron Mitchell is superb, and so is Jane Mansfield in one of her best parts!
This is an inspiring thriller,well made, and far from mainstream movies of the past and present.
A must see original, with a strong script,and desperate
characters!

2441246,3,B000BT96OQ,"I saw this movie on late night television back in the early 1970's.  Certainly not a great movie, but Jayne Mansfield has always been fun to watch.  I give it 2 stars for moviemaking and 4 stars for nostalgia.  The picture quality is very good, the extras are poor, but it satisfies all my expectations.",1213920000,4,303,4.472727272727273
2441247,4,B000BT96OQ,"This movie is a howl from beginning to end! If your a Mansfield fan, you'll love it! Jayne looks fantastic with her overprocessed cotton candy bubble hairdo. She's Funny, sexy, and camp, all at the same time. As far as Jayne's later career b-movies, relying on Jayne's name to make it worth seeing, this IS THE ONE! BUY IT! You'll watch it more than once..... Guaranteed!",1202774400,7,371,4.636363636363637
2441248,2,B000BT96OQ,"Not good on any level, though passable as camp.  If the actors didn't repeat all their lines five times, this film would be eight minutes long.  Not Agatha Christie and not ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this film's closer ancestors are ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" or ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" though lacking their delightful excess.  You'll be entertained for ten minutes, checking your watch after twelve

The bonus features are the best part, but total maybe seven minutes long.  Mostly interesting was the fact that Jayne, who's pitifully washed up in the film, wasn't 33 years old.",1155254400,5,587,4.948979591836735
2441249,4,B000BT96OQ,"This DVD contains a very crisp, virtually flawless copy of this pretty weird but visually beautiful black and white movie. The plot is inspired by Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians: People are holed up on an island in the Mediterranean and somebody is killing them off one by one. There is quite some gore and brutality. One character's face is covered with blood throughout the movie, although one would think he has plenty of occasions to wash it off. Jayne Mansfield's eye makeup starts running, too. What's more, she has a shiner (result of a fight with an other lady on a small fishing boat)! She basically plays a parody of herself and is quite effective in that role. Cinematography and set design are of high quality and make Dog eat Dog something like an offbeat arthouse movie. Did Quentin Tarantino ever watch it? The whole set up reminded me repeatedly of his Reservoir Dogs.

Interesting bonus material contains two short b&w newsreel items, one about Mansfield's visit to Budapest with then husband Micky Hargitay - apparently made by a Hungarian crew for Hungarian moviegoers (the visit was made en route to the set of Dog eat Dog in Yugoslavia). The second is a very short announcment of Mansfield's untimely death with stock footage showing her with the British Queen's sister, Princess Margaret (of all people).

8092478,2,B000BT96OQ,"There is actually a good premise at the heart of Dog Eat Dog!--rather than show the heist and its preparation this movie starts after the heist has already been committed and gets straight to the the double crossing.  As the movie begins Dolph (Ivor Salter) is gleefully trying to kill his former accomplice Lyle (Cameron Mitchell) because a two way split seems much more attractive than three.  The movie cuts between Dolph's laughing attempts to run down Lyle and Jayne Mansfield rolling around on a hotel bed filled with money.  During this sequence Jayne Mansfield looks almost exactly like Divine.

Dolph thinks he's knocked off Lyle and goes back to the hotel not realizing that because of his dim-witted girlfriend the manager has figured out that they are the robbers of the million dollars who are constantly talked about on the radio and he comes up with his own plan to steal the loot and blow up the robbers with his sister as an accomplice.  That doesn't work out as planned and they all end up on an island with a deserted villa that doesn't actually turn out to be deserted--there's a batty old woman named Lady Xenia who came to the villa to die and her stocky butler who almost immediately starts angling for his own piece of the dough.

Dog Eat Dog! has a definite make-it-up-as-they-went-along quality that provides some out of left field laughs but doesn't help matters much if the filmmakers actually expected audiences to take any of this seriously.  Elisabeth Flickenschildt who plays Lady Xenia seems to be pretty certain that she's in a comedy; Cameron Mitchell, on the other hand, works up a sweat trying to drag Dog Eat Dog! kicking and screaming into serious serious crime film territory; Jayne Mansfield generally doesn't seem to know what she is doing--her acting is so awful it's hard to believe that she once made movies for major Hollywood studios.

The money disappears and one by one the people on the island start to turn up dead--it's sort of like Ten Little Indians except it sucks.  People who enjoy laughing at bad movies should find a lot to enjoy in Dog Eat Dog!--everything about this one cries out camp.  But if you have better things to do with your time than watch terrible movies Dog Eat Dog! is definitely not for you.",1422316800,2,2266,4.713924050632912

8092480,5,B000BT96OQ,"As far as trashy, offbeat, unintentionally funny B-movies go, few can top DOG EAT DOG (1964) in overall bizzareness and manage to be as entertaining. Five stars isn't overrating it, trust me.

Jayne Mansfield heads a cast that includes Cameron Mitchell, Ivor Salter, Isa Miranda, Werner Peters, Aldo Camarida and Dody Heath in a fast-paced yarn about a $1 million cash heist and everyone's greed to possess it. As Jayne says, ""I got a pash for the cash!""

Directed by Ray Nazarro (Asst. Director on 1936's REEFER MADNESS), Richard Cunha and Gustav Gavrin, and shot on location along the beautiful Adriatic and Mediterranean coastlines, and an island villa, DOG EAT DOG mixes intrigue and ripe performances in a way that maintains interest throughout. Often times the dubbed dialog is over the top - but that's to its credit - after all this is a CULT film, and we love cult films for their unabashed outrageousness. Mitchell's violently desperate search for the money is one of the film's highlights that has to be seen to be believed.

Darksky Films' DVD of DOG EAT DOG is of pristine quality; the lush, creamy black and white cinematography is a pleasure to indulge yourself in, as are the charms of Miss Mansfield - she's pretty hot in this. The film is formatted to its correct 1.85:1 aspect ratio and is letterboxed.

The extras include newsreel footage of Jayne Mansfield, a photo gallery and the theatrical trailer.

Jayne Mansfield and cult film aficionados will definitely want to pick this one up. Dog eat dog is right! Highly recommended.",1395705600,,1549,4.8745247148288975
8092481,4,B000BT96OQ,"For several years I've enjoyed the many films of blonde bombshell Marilyn Monroe, especially her comedies. More recently, I've become interested in seeing what her competition from the 50's and 60's was up too! That would be Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield. I've always been a fan of ""The Girl Can't Help It"", so I was curious to finally see some of Jayne's other lesser known work.
Dog Eat Dog! turns out to be a great little, ""cheezy"" movie with campy acting and a storyline that's way ""over the top"".
This is a small budget film shot in Europe with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. I am especially impressed with the crisp, stunning black & white cinematography. Jayne Mansfield, Cameron Mitchell, and the rest of the cast are actually quite good in it. The story: a trio of thieves steal a million dollars in old US banknotes that are supposed to be sent back to America to be destroyed. I think that fans of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez might like this movie. Dog Eat Dog! looks like it would have been a fun little Drive-In picture to see back on a warm summer night in the 1960's. The film has a stylish European look to it.",1392681600,,1151,4.433962264150943
8092482,5,B000BT96OQ,Dog Eat Dog ! is a European film Jayne Mansfield made in 1964. Also known as When Strangers Meet. Jayne has a particularly hilarious line about her panties you have to listen for to believe. Jayne fans love her in anything.,1381708800,,223,4.463414634146342
8092483,4,B000BT96OQ,"This is a crazed mad surreal glorious mess. It's total chaos and non-stop action from start to finish.

The violence and nihilism of film noir crash head on into an over-the-top beyond-ludicrous plot that piles one jaw-dropping absurdity atop another.

Sadistic scumbags laugh gleefully as they murder and torture.

The pneumatic Jayne Mansfield runs amok as an utterly immoral nymphomaniac tramp, in a reducto-ad-absurdum blonde bombshell performance that calls to mind John Water's great star Divine.

Stare in disbelief as Jayne rolls around in a negligee on a bed full of thousand dollar bills, gets a nasty black eye in a catfight, complains about her dirty underwear, and constantly makes lurid and absurd cracks.

There's a whole bunch of other oddball and depraved characters, too, most of whom are constantly trying to kill each other.

The dialogue is completely deranged, sometimes stunningly so.

The film is often visually striking, with very attractive black and white photography. A great stinking piece of pure gutter trash, with some stand-out moments and lotsa laughs. Nice clean clear print, too!",1372464000,5,1115,5.301136363636363
