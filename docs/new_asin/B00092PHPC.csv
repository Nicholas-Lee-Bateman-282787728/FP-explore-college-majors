8056786,1,B00092PHPC,CD was scratched.  It played but would freeze when it got to a scratch large enough and I had to fast fwd until it would play again. This is very old and outdated. I recommend just watching the series the Bible on netflix. That was awesome.,1519862400,,240,4.217391304347826
8056787,3,B00092PHPC,12 episides (6 per disc) 30 minutes each. The acting is good. Sound is fine but picture is poor because the 16mm film prints (used for the DVD transfer) are worn with noticable dirt & scratches in the picture which distracts from the enjoyment of the episodes. From a historicle point of view these are fine & true to the Bible. You may want to watch one episode at a time (as I did) rather than watching the whole thing in 1 to 4 sittings.,1142467200,3,440,4.188235294117647
