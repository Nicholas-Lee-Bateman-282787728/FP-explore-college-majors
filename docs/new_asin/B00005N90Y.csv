1631923,4,B00005N90Y,"The old saw the grass is greener meaning what you don't have and the other person do makes you envious, jealous or whatever other untoward emotion comes to mind has various applications not all of them serious, or seemingly serious. That idea gets full play in this 1960s film under review, The Grass Is Greener, a comic look at the other side, the comic side of the old saw. The comic look in the film takes place in one of the stately mansions of England and involves a certain amount of hanky-panky by adulterous adults. Usually adultery gets serious play in dramas and such but here it will all work out in the end-maybe.

Hey, wait a minute what about one of those ten commandments, you know the one about not coveting (nice word) thy neighbors wife (or husband to be up to date, coveting wives and husbands if you are in a polygamous society or sect to cover every possibility). That rule gets short shrift here. This is the skinny. The owners of the old family estate, the Earl, Victor, played by Cary Grant, and his wife the Countess, Hilary, played by Deborah Kerr are up against it what with taxes and upkeep now like many aristocrats in post-World War II England. Their solution was to open their mansion to royalty crazy tourists, including lots of Americans who secretly long for the royal touch. Fair enough.

But one of those Americans, a rich one, a rich oil man, Charles Delacro, Delacroix, or whatever his surname was, played by Robert Mitchum not known for his comedic talents, barges into the private area of the mansion and confront the Countess, Hilary, and makes a big play for her with plenty of old time sweet and high blown words. Normally such a situation would have the guy shown the door. Not here, not Hilary in the end, since above and beyond those tax and upkeep problems she is bored with her life, bored with hubby (amazingly bored with Cary Grant the epitome of suave and sexy manhood in those days-go figure) and very open to an affair. Hence the bit about coveting thy neighbors wife above. And along the way to show his devotion and to tweak Victor as well Charles provided a now politically incorrect mink coat.

This is a comedy and so some hi-jinks come into play as does the Victors ex-girlfriend an American heiress, Hattie, played by Jean Simmons who is covering for Hilary while she is having her affair and at the same time trying to rekindle her own past affair with the Earl. Victor showing that nth degree of good breeding, a smart guy when you think about it instead of beating himself over the head for his inadequacies or his fallen wife for her indiscretions attempts to win her back from that upstart arriviste American, oil millions or not. He makes a lot of big sophisticated and witty talk to his wife, to Charles, and to anybody else who will listen.

Here is the closer. He challenges Charles to a duel, a duel of honor like back about ten generations before as the way to settle this violation of his sense of honor. By hook or by crook they have their duel in which the Earl is mysteriously wounded (mysterious since the Earls butler acting as second had put blanks in each gun). This gallant behavior wins Hilary back and Charles finally is shown the door. Hattie, well she walked out with him-and with that now politically incorrect mink. So breathe a sigh of relief as Cary Grant keeps his title as a guy that women do not leave.",1484352000,,3393,4.5301794453507345

1631952,5,B00005N90Y,"Totally enjoyable film.  Some of the reviewers are wrapped a bit too tightly on moral grounds, this is a comedy after all. Yes, if I was married to someone as dreamy as Cary Grant  would I be open to a flirtation with millionaire oil man played by Robert Mitchum.  MMMM... Robert Mitchum;)

Anyway, very fun movie with four excellent actors. Deborah Kerr was her classic self, beautiful and contained.  The chemistry between her and Mitchum was excellent. In reel life, they were each others favorite actors to work with, so Mitchum is not his usual sleepy cinema self.  He is on point as the single man with a mission, wooing Deborah to leave her husband for him.  Cary Grant was resourceful about keeping his wife. Kind of a charming and cunning cat and mouse game between these two men.  Also, Grant presents a mature quality and thoughtful approach to  his marriage. Certainly a nice touch of morality that one no longer sees in films.
Finally Jean Simmons plays the kind of friend we can all do without. As the chatty social butterfly she keeps the action moving.  Great use of 4 big stars, all their talents were well utilized.  A fun film to watch..",1468713600,,1156,4.617647058823529

1631996,2,B00005N90Y,"I probably should have given it just one star, but Hate is such a strong word. So the 2 stars go toward production values and the costumes.
It's a ridiculous premise that borrows heavily from much better films (regarding dialogue and mannerisms) but it really goes nowhere. You would not only have to suspend disbelief to imagine Kerr choosing Mitchum over Grant, you'd have to practically throw your sensibilities over a cliff. I was never especially a fan of Robert Mitchum as a romantic lead, and here he's stiff, choppy and unsympathetic. His character less charm than a wooden puppet. He plays an overbearing, rich, rude American who manipulates his way into the private section of a tourist attraction estate and we are supposed to believe that the elegant Deborah Kerr is immediately intrigued and infatuated with him.

Meanwhile, her husband, played by Cary Grant, pads about in comfortable home attire and is still 10 times as sophisticated as the expensively dressed Mitchum. Jean Simmons appears to be there to even out the numbers and to provide some comic relief. Her character is just as shallow as Mitchum's but I had to wait until the very end for this inevitability.

What a waste of time, actors, film, etc.",1464480000,,1225,4.884615384615385

I was tired of all of the low moral standards of modern movies, so decided to go back in time and watch some old ones, expecting a little more discretion. Although you don't technically see anything inappropriate, the theme of this movie is totally deplorable. The wife just up and leaves her husband with some random guy she just met for absolutely NO REASON. It was really, really sad. So then you see him invite both of them to the house to try and win her back. I didn't watch beyond that because I was so horrified by it all, so I don't know if it ever got resolved.

Cary Grant as Victor has a detailed strategy how to win back his wife and bring her safely  from her wonder-lust adventure. He discusses it with Jean Simmons character. I find myself wondering about a message coded in here, as it has a world of wisdom in it and it has me glued to the screen His lordship's butler is also so superbly portrayed  in this movie, by always prim and proper, like his character here requires, young Moray Watson. Jean Simmons in her designer  clothes throughout is a special treat for me. She is funny, she is outrageous, she is daring and she is a truly lovely soul. We can not forget Robert Michum with his dreamy eyes and sexiness. The fishing escapade of both Cary Grant and Robert Michum characters is a prize winner here, as is a real, old fashioned duel between two men. It is a must to see.

Always a pleasure to watch Cary Grant, but add in Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum, and Jean Simmons in probably the only truly comedic role I've seen her play, and I was just tickled pink.  The dialogue was fast-paced and witty, and the plot outrageous: Mitchum's reprehensibly bad manners utterly shocking from start to finish, for a day when such things just weren't done, coupled (pun intended) with Kerr's portrayal of a weak-willed ""lady"" who never even hesitates at carrying on with an interloper literally under her husband's nose, made this all the more fun as I realized that this film was made 55 years ago.  Today we'd be more incensed at the property trespass than the marital one.  At any rate, a fun film I'll have to add to my DVD collection; hopefully the lack of subtitles will be corrected at some point.  I watched it via Prime Instant Video, and the subtitles were there, although a bit out of sync with the audio.",1438214400,,970,4.682352941176471

He has excellent chemistry with both actresses and you can tell they like working together.

Cary Grant played the role of an English lord who was opening his great home to paying visitors while he wife was cultivating mushrooms.

1632444,1,B00005N90Y,"Sick & Stupid Score: 7/8*

Infidelity is funny?  Not.  And neither is this movie.  The marketing positions it as a classic ""screwball"" comedy but it hardly comes up to that standard.  If you laugh once or twice during the whole movie, you will probably be laughing at some disparaging remark made by someone sitting next to you.

Employing the liberal theory of marriage that any bad behavior can be justified if a couple can talk about it openly and endlessly, this movie comes to the conclusion that infidelity is no big deal and no reason for divorce.  If you think snappy chitchat is a good substitute for intelligent dialog, you might find the script interesting.  Chitchat is what Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr do best; whereas, Robert Mitchum comes off like a talking fence post.  Jean Simmons is just ditzy, and no one is sure why she is even in the movie, including herself, judging by her acting.  Note, also, all of these actors are on the downside of their careers.

Avoid this so-called comedy.  It is and was an un-funny flop.
__________________________________________________________________________
* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

1632448,2,B00005N90Y,"This entire film is a thinly veiled discourse justifying the infidelity of husbands as the natural course of marital events, and not a very good one. It wouldn't make any difference if the script were clever, but alas...

The plot attempts at wit by giving the infidelity to the wife, then showing how a reasonable (man) husband would behave in the circumstance.  The set up is that Deborah Kerr has a great marriage with her loving and attentive husband, Cary Grant, but when Robert Mitchum takes an intentional wrong turn on a tour of their home (their main source of income), she immediately falls in love with him, and begins an affair

His character is repeatedly asked throughout the film if he cheated, but refuses to answer such an irrelevant question.  Grant even has a line explaining this is the reason why wives wear rings and husbands don't. Kerr's character is a the stereotypically ditzy (woman) wife who doesn't know what she wants until a man shows her, or there is money involved (she initially tells Mitchum to leave, but then invites him for tea after learning he's a millionaire).

The film tries very hard to be clever but never quite makes it, lacks likable characters or believable situations, drags out too long, and is even missing pivotal scenes (Mitchum & Grant talk after the fact about the recourse Grant's character decides to take, but we don't actually get to see him bring it up!)

1632581,5,B00005N90Y,"The movie is somewhat dated now (""Hillary? That's a boy's name!"") but watching this movie is like slipping into a comfortable pair of old slippers. These are old friends, witty, warm, and hilarious, in situations that are universal. This is what I would call a ""chamber"" movie, a small cast and just a couple of locations, a movie that moves at a sedate, measured pace.

The performances in this movie are world-class: Cary Grant as Victor Rhyall, a traditionalist, trying to hang on to his way of life and to the wife he remains deeply in love with; Deborah Kerr as Hillary Rhyall, a woman torn between the passion of a new relationship and the comfort of the old one; Robert Mitchum as Charles Delacro, an American oil millionaire, forward, aggressive, and used to getting what he wants; and Jean Simmons as Hattie Durant, the wacky flirtatious friend of Hillary and Victor.

The basic story is quite simple: Charles Delacro is on a tour of stately homes and he opens a private door to the apartments of Victory and Hillary Rhyall, where he meets Hillary. The attraction is immediate, mutual, and palpable. Hillary finds herself dazed and torn, as she, almost against her will, travels to London to meet her new lover. Her husband Victor recognizes what's going on but doesn't know how to deal with it. While Hillary is in London, her best friend (and former girlfriend of Victor) travels to visit Victor, to offer advice and comfort.

The situations come to a head when the four of them come to the estate for a weekend party. Victor's ultimate solution to his dilemma is novel and I won't spoil things by revealing the solution or the eventual outcome. Suffice to say that the movie and the performances are very satisfying.

I have to give a shout-out to the opening credits by Maurice Binder, by the way, which are wonderfully hilarious, with various diapered babies in appropriate poses (e.g., a picture of a baby playing with a roll of a film when giving the credit for the film's editor).",1390089600,,1997,4.713467048710601

1632634,5,B00005N90Y,"This is one classy comedy.  It has a premise which is very simple, a conflict that results when Robert Mitchum seduces Deborah Kerr away from her husband Cary Grant.  Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are an earl and his lady who have to host tours of their manor and grow mushrooms to make ends meet.  Robert Mitchum, an American millionaire, is part of a tour and seeks out Deborah Kerr, looking for a tryst.  She attempts to deceive Cary Grant that she's going to London for business when she actually is pursuing an affair with Mitchum.  Cary Grant gets both of them to come back to his manor and engages in repartee and eventually sets up a duel with Mitchum.  What this movie does, due to the writers, is send you on a delightful journey without making the affair part of the enjoyment.  Cary Grant never made a movie glorifying adultery.  The enjoyment is not the affair, but how Cary Grant responds to it, and the lighthearted tone and serious theme never felt to me like an unnatural conglomeration.  Cary Grant is strongly moral through the movie and wants Deborah Kerr back only if she wants to come back, but doesn't want to end the marriage.  His persona by this period of his career has an added dimension of maturity and willingness to wait things out instead of act recklessly, which I think makes him even more appealing than in his earlier films.  He makes the acting seem so easy as he rattles off comebacks that are incisive and hilarious.  The script is fantastic, making me enjoy the whole journey of how he gets Deborah Kerr back.  The music is funny and the supporting actors are memorable.  There's a moral underpinning to the movie about marital fidelity that makes the story funny but not disrespectful or smutty.  It's got the wit of 30s-40s romantic comedies and has a more jolly style than Billy Wilder's romantic comedies.  It has the incisiveness of more sexual comedies but with a jolliness and good philosophy of marriage.  I like Cary Grant's statements about marriage being a commitment you take as a complete package, rather than just the immediate sensual gratification, and that you shouldn't easily divorce someone for a mistake, even if that mistake is adultery.  I'm proud of the writers for fighting the trend, which was toward laughing at infidelity.  The writers were husband and wife, which I think makes the script feel breezy, like a natural relationship exists between Grant and Kerr.  Kerr had done great performances with both Grant and Mitchum soon before this movie, which also makes the character relationships feel natural.  I think all of the actors are excellent and especially enjoy seeing two of my favorite actors, Cary Grant and Robert Mitchum, interact.

I conclude with a summary taken from Wikipedia's article about the play, which was turned into the movie:
""J. C. Trewin includes Grass is Greener as one of the top four plays of 1958-59.  He describes Grass is Greener as the best of William's three comedies, noting its ""glancing wit"" and ""well bred ease.""  Trewin describes ""neatly constructed,"" with much of the comedy coming from ""apparent irrelevance.""""

There are lots of funny jokes that seem spontaneous and effervescent.  I enjoyed rewatching this movie (just before writing this review) as much as when I first saw it a while ago.",1375833600,,3300,4.806737588652482

1632638,4,B00005N90Y,"It all depends on what you are looking for in a movie and your susceptibility level.  I'm an old movie fan and abhor the blatant fare provided today.  Some may call this hypocritical, and this film no doubt skims lightly over a very important moral issue.  However, in this case, I could just enjoy some of what I particularly enjoy from older movies -- beautiful houses, furniture, some of the English based to-do, clothes and all of that.  Old movies are particularly illusionary in providing this without the nasty realism of modern days that has a way of getting into your gut.  And please keep in mind that modern movies generally have the illicit lovers triumph, not what happens here.  The light touch is part of the appeal of the older ones. It's entertainment, always a bit of a fantasy.  I do know the difference between that and reality. Beautiful people in a beautiful setting involved in an absurd farce. If you really can't help being drawn off the straight and narrow by such a thing now and again, then by all means, be responsible to yourself and avoid.

On another note, I remember hearing this was panned by critics at the time of release, so have kind of remembered it that way, though did enjoy the overall spectacle on a rerun a while back.  True, it was not the high water mark in acting for any of the performers.  But, going back to it now, it is still very entertaining and I am glad I have it to enjoy the strong production values and some of yesterday's stars in a glamor bit together.  Jolly good fun actually.  Best not taken too seriously.

As far as the product goes, this was a used copy I took a risk on and it proved worth it.  Very crisp, clear, vivid resolution with smooth playing.

1632711,2,B00005N90Y,"Cary Grant almost makes this terrible film worth seeing. He manages to bring his style and class, not to mention his very good looks, to this role of a befuddled English earl who is fighting to keep his wife.  The wife is played by the wonderful Deborah Kerr but she is terribly miscast.  Ms. Kerr reeks of integrity and intelligence and cannot convince the audience that she could possible be silly enough to fall in love with a brash American millionaire, Robert Mitchem, in ten minutes. What intelligent sensible woman could risk her happy marriage with Cary Gtant for a fling with Robert Mitchem?  Maybe he smells good or exudes theramones or something that we cannot see in this film.

The whole plot rests on this flimsy occurrence, and if anyone has bothered to read the title of the film, we know how it will end up.  It might be fun to see the plot unfold, but it really isn't.  The Jean Simmons character is meant to liven up the story a little but just acts silly.  The butler, Sellars, does the best job.  But that isn't enough.  Robert Mitchem is a great film presence and I have enjoyed his performances a lot but here he's just a big rich oaf.

Not only is the plot absurdly lame but the last part is terribly talky.  Maybe when the film was made, this passed for wit but it is now just tedious and boring.

Cary Grant plays a British Earl strapped for cash, so he has tours of his English mansion to pay the rent.  His wife (Deborah Kerr) plays a mushroom picking wife with two children (that we never see).  One day a rich  American tourist millionaire (Robert Mitchum) and decides he loves the Earl's wife and proposes to have an affair with her.  The dialogue is pompous ""stiff upper lip""  as the actors play cold-hearted games with marriages and lives.  The script does not fit Mitchum, nor Grant very well, although they do their best to save the film.  I became bored.  Cary Grant is much funnier in slapstick, like ""Bringing Up Baby"" - and Mitchum is better in Westerns and film noir.  There is also the constant reference to a ""Coo-Coo Bird"" throughout, and I guess that was supposed to be funny.  It just grates on one's nerves every time the bird is mentioned.

Overall it is snobbish, full of talk and a small silly plot of a wife cheating on her husband.",1293494400,,1247,4.563063063063063
1632716,4,B00005N90Y,"CARY GRANT is a happily-married, (to DEBORAH KERR), English Earl in this frothy delight of an old-fashioned comedy-romance, called ""THE GRASS IS GREENER"".  The Earl, believe it or not, has money problems, and the HUGE and TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL mansion he live in with his wife and two children is now actually OWNED by the English ""National Trust"" - a very real organization. that has taken over many of the ""stately homes"" of England, for financial reasons.  And yet, the
noble families who once owned them, still DO continue to live in them.  (The mansion that Grant's character's family lives in is totally spectacular, and MUST be a real mansion hired out to play the movie role of Grant's fictional Earl's home.  Sadly, the NAME of this stately home is NOT given....although the EXTERIOUR is shown, along with those of neighbouring stately homes, towards the very beginning of the programme --whilst Noel Coward's song, ""The Stately Homes of England"" is played, and sung to, in the background.)  Just seeing the interiours, (as featured in the first part of the movie, ""The Museum"", is, to those who love fine architecture and furniture, worth the price of this movie!

The VERY beginning, of course, features the credits.  Amusingly, we see the back of a new, sitting BABY each time a cast member is mentioned.  Why?  Because this movie is about primal human
instincts -- instincts that are put forth readily when one is a baby, and are but barely disguised, even in adulthood.

The Earl's wife, (Ms. Kerr), is, you see --even though truly happily married --attracted to the rather forceful American Millionaire, (ROBERT MICHUM), who shows up during one of the hours when other tourists are traipsing through the Earl's ancestral home.  He opens the door marked ""private"", and the mutual attraction between himself and the Earl's wife is soon obvious to both of them.  And to the audience.  And, also, to the Earl, who pops in in the last moments.

Civilly, however, none of the principals actually comes off and mentions it --  at first.  But then the Earl's wife has to have her hair done.  Obviously there are no hairdressers expert enough in the country district where they live, to do the Lady's hair -- and also, just as obviously, she and the Earl do NOT have the money to bring an expert hairdresser to their mansion.  (Both the Earl and his lady grow mushrooms to sell, to make a little extra cash...)  So, it's off on a train to London, to visit a top hairdresser, to which the Lady of the manor soon goes....  Waiting for her, quite unexpectedly, is the American Millionaire, who has just before called up ALL the leading hairdressers in London, to find out at which one the object of his affections will be.  There is no train till the next day, and so American Millionaire and English Lady go to a chic restaurant, and some museums, before she must leave for home...

The Lady has stayed at the home of her friend -- a chatterbox and oddball, played by JEAN SIMMONS.  Situations then go from ""pillar to post"", which many amusing situations -- and a lot of very witty repartee.  Finally, a (pistol) duel ensues, between the two male contenders for Ms. Kerr's character's affections....

All in all, this is a VERY well-written, well-directed, well-acted movie.  The settings and costumes are gorgeous, (Hardie Ames, and Norman Hartnell -- also designers of Quen Elizabeth II's gowns and suits -- designed the ladie's costumes.  The dialogue is quick, funny, literate. VEDDY British, amusing and witty.  This is admittedly can be called an ""old-fashioned"" movie, for ""old fashioned"" people who LIKE lovely costumes and settings, and LIKE movies WITHOUT four-letter words or rock music, (or even it's 1960s equivalent, Beatnick music).  Yet the idea of a happily-married woman being attracted to a handsome stranger is....well, NOT so very old-fashioned!  This is an EXTREMELY cultured and civilized movie -- but it does, well, ""wink"" a bit.  All ends happily, of course....

...........................................................

P.S. A SAD, REAL SIDELIGHT.......Stanley Donen, who directed this movie, once had a romance with the very young, and then as-yet-unmarried Elizabeth Taylor.  But, as Donen was Jewish, Taylor was not, and the studio disapproved, the romance never had a chance. (Sigh!)

P.P.S.:  A HAPPY, REAL SIDELIGHT.......Robert Michum, who plays the American Millionaire in this movie, actually spent some time on a Southern US chain-gang as a youth.  But he escaped -- and became an iconic movie star, who played many roles -- including, in this movie, that of an American Oil Millionaire!  : )",1287619200,,4631,4.973992197659298

It's even worse when you consider that the brash charmer is Robert Mitchum (a man who exudes menace), and the abandoned husband is Cary Grant, the world's most charming man.

Jean Simmons has a very small role in the movie as a friend of the wife.

The plot seems contrived at times, and were it not for such outstanding actors in these roles, the movie would fall flat on its face. However, when you have Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr, and Robert Mitchum in the same movie, it is well worth watching.

I doubt any of us would chose the method that the husband (Grant) chooses to save his marriage, but how many of us live in a house that is so large private tours are shown through it just to pay the taxes.",1181174400,,762,4.248275862068965

There was one scene that, I will grant you, was light and entertaining.  Not laugh out loud, but funny enough (I won't spoil it by saying which one).  Aside from that, the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity.

Most of all, you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne.  Grant and Simmons, in particular, are strong - but their efforts are ultimately squandered.  Bob Mitchum is OK, but generally miscast, and Kerr's beauty and talent are basically wasted.  No amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here.  She goes from happily married to tramp in about 5 minutes, for no discernible reason.

How could it not be great! But, the story leaves something to be desired, mainly just a hint of realism. I understand this is suppose to be a sweet romantic story, that is probably suppose to be anything but real, but just a hint of realism could of make this work. C'mon lets be honest. What man would react to the same situation Grant finds himself in? You see his wife Deborah Kerr runs off with Robert Mitchum. And Grant is perfectly understanding. He never makes an attempt to go after her. She lies to Grant and just goes with Mitchum. The one thing I hate most about movies like this is. If it was a man that ran off with another women, no one would find it romantic. Women would bash him for what he did. But, when a women runs away with another man, all of a sudden it's romantic. Is something wrong with this picture? You bet! This has a sloppy script, and unbelievanle characters. Redeeming moments are the use of Noel Coward's music, the acting, and Donnen's directing.

Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

I don't know why The Grass is Greener isn't a go-to classic comedy, like Some Like it Hot or It Happened One Night. Its darling! Based off the play by Hugh Williams and Margaret Vyner, its hilarious, witty, charming, and endearing.

Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are married and stuck in a minor rut. When Deborah meets an American tourist, their attraction is undeniable. Yes, I know, she has Cary Grant at home, so perhaps Robert Mitchum is the only man Hollywood could have cast to make her infidelity believable! Before long, Deb and Bob are having a hot-and-heavy affair, and to help him deal with the problem, Cary recruits the advice of his faithful butler Moray Watson and his flirtatious friend Jean Simmons.

Every part of this movie is cute, even the song during the opening credits and Hardy Amiess beautiful costumes. The script is very funny, with a mixture of jokes, wry one-liners, and situational comedy. Im not even a Deborah Kerr fan, but shes just as delightful in this movie as her three co-stars.

Remember the split-screen scene in When Harry Met Sally when the four friends are on the phone? That scene was a re-make; the hilarious original can be found in The Grass is Greener. I highly recommend this cute comedy. After you watch it, maybe youll adopt the phrase, So I went to Harrods and bought a sponge! in your household, as I have in mine.",1500940800,,1429,4.6141732283464565
