8127608,4,B000FXV1L4,"After this watching this movie you realise Govinda really is no. 1. Govinda is easily the best actor in Bollywood after Amitabh Bachchan. Govinda did very well in his comedic role, as that is best suited for him and he as well as the entire industry knows that he is too good. Urmila was very good too. Naghma did fairly well for her side role. Kadar Khan did well in making up the dysfunctional family and added to the comedy. Overall, the acting was well done.the songs were very movie-oriented and the dancing was good (for a Govinda film, how can it not be?). The shots of New Zealand were beautiful and exceptionally noteworthy. The Storyline was very unique and Kunwara carried off well, with the right comedy punches",1304467200,,723,4.612403100775194
