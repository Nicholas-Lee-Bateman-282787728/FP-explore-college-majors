8694188,4,B00R5CSHCO,"I am in favor of anything that honors this great man. Most of the dancing is extraordinary, as was he. A couple of the presentations were just O.K.,
hence the 4 stars, rather than 5. But, overall, a good addition to any ballet collection.",1433289600,,238,4.431818181818182
8694189,5,B00R5CSHCO,"A generous selection of spine tingling performances by a stellar cast, selected from senior Ballet companies. The vast stage of Le Palais des Congrs de Paris presents an ideal platform for these outstanding performers to demonstrate their talents.
The clever use of projected backdrop scenes allows for continuity of the performance and without awaiting scenery changes. Hence a full programme of performance is packed into the viewing time with only a short spoken tribute to Nureyev at the beginning and at the conclusion. There are short views of performers behind stage, preparing for performance or ending the performance, which provides insight into their emotions. The sight of Tomara Roja psyching up for her performances is wonderful, pure grit and determination.
Everything about this product exudes high quality.
The details of the performances and performers are well stated here in the Amazon descriptive text, whilst the title of each piece is introduced on screen at the start of each performance with the names and present company of each performer at the end of each performance.
This is a very worthwhile, enjoyable confection of entertainment and should be on every ones wish list. Never have I seen Nureyev,but this would be a beautiful tribute for anyone.",1425254400,2,1276,5.259803921568627
