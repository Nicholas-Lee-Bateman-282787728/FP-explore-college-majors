8434273,5,630320161X,This criminally hard-to-find James Joyce's Ulysses episode of the wonderful 'Ten Great Writers' documentary series is a real must-see. The world of Ulysses and Joyce are opened up to us by dramatisations of the book itself and of James Joyce's pondering on his writing. It also includes people like Anthony Burgess explaining the text as they see it. A very enjoyable watch.,1407196800,,374,5.048387096774194
