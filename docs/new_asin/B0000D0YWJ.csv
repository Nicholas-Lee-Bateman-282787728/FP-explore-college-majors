1920568,5,B0000D0YWJ,"I first saw this film when it came out and was surprised, if not shocked, that a film could be made about the importance of culture (to everyone; but in particular to Native Americans) and the attempts of tribes to locate children ""stolen"" from their homes and ""repatriate"" them back into their families and communities.  In 1976, a US Congressional report found that one out of two (50%) Native American children were either adopted into, or placed in the ""foster"" care of, Non-Native American families.  This ""process"" was, additionally, causing problems for many Reservation/Reserve communities, because as these children became of age they were aimlessly searching for their ""real"" families.  In 1978, the ""Indian Child Welfare Act"" was approved by Congress in an attempt to stem the problems.  However, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was basically opposed to the law and failed to adequately enforce the law.  None-the-less, by the late 1980s many tribes were actively seeking ways to help these children through actions that have come to be called ""repatriation"": re-uniting children with family members on the reservation/reserve and attempting to teach them of their traditional culture.  This process also derived from the desire to help so called ""problem"" children; children that were unwanted and who hated themselves, and were often in trouble.

The Canadian government, seemingly slower at doing things, actually worked out a system that was somewhat more proactive in the ""repatriation"" process.  ""Spirit Rider,"" then, is a Canadian made for television movie, that depicts these efforts on one of the Ojibwa (Chippewa here in the US) reserves in Manitoba to help tribal members.

Given the budget, the topic, and the reality of made for television movies, ""Spirit Rider"" is a bold, beautiful film, deserving of far greater recognition than it has received--regardless of one's political position on ""repatriation.""  Yes, there are some generalizations that are injected into the story, but they do not overwhelm the viewer.  My sole problem with the film is that it (the DVD in particular) relies upon the subsequent careers of Graham Greene and Adam Beach by advertising them as the stars of the film.  The true stars of the film are: 1) Michelle St. John, who plays Camilla St. Claire, a young Ojibwa girl raised on the Reserve that wishes to help Jesse ""repatriate""; 2) Herbie Barnes, who plays the central character, Jesse Three Bears, a young boy raised in foster homes and who wants nothing to do with the Reserve or ""repatriation;"" 3) Tom Jackson, who plays Albert St. Clair, Camilla's father, a pragmatic man attempting to run the local store, while being supportive of his ""traditional culture;"" 4) Tantoo Cardinal, who plays Marilyn St. Claire, Camilla's mother, a school teacher, and local repatriation project coordinator; and 5) Gordon Tootoosis, portraying Joe Moon, Jesse's grandfather who has been in prison and had problems with drinking, but was raised in Ojibwa cultural traditions (including speaking Ojibwa as his first language, and is now seen as a resource of cultural knowledge).

Please do not take this to be a diminishing of Greene's and Beach's performances--they are wonderful--but an acknowledgment that they are not the ""stars"" of the movie.

This is a wonderful movie for everyone, and I highly recommend it.

1920569,4,B0000D0YWJ,"Jesse (Herbie Barnes) has been bouncing from foster home to foster home and he thinks he's finally found a place.  The mom obviously wants to keep him, but the social workers say he's got to move back to the reservation for repatriotation.

He knew his grandfather, who is his only living kin, had spent time in jail, but he hadn't been prepared for the living conditions on the rez.  Joe(Gordon ((Tootoosis) lives in an old boxcar with no electricity and when he talks about taking a ride, he means on a horse.

But, when Paul LeBlanc (Adam Beach) tells him he doesn't belong there, leaving is the last thing on his mind.  This is especially so since Camilla ((Michelle St. John) has caught his eye.  The rivalry for Camilla only intensifies when both boys enter the Yellow Quill race.

The story in this film is very similar to that of ""Smoke Signals"".  Both are well done and likable for different reasons, though I think this film is more appropriate for younger audiences.  Both are very well done.

1920570,4,B0000D0YWJ,"Good quality.  Quick Service!
Video in excellent,  It realistically portrayed the problems and culture of the Native American -- one thing is its use of steam-of-consciousness technique -- this was excellent in portraying the myths and legends of Native peoples -- many of which were even new to me.",1214611200,9,299,5.081632653061225
1920571,5,B0000D0YWJ,"This was a wonderful movie.  True to life, as native americans are tossed into our messy society, they can get lost.  Their souls misunderstood and in short, they lose their way for a time.  This young boy is no exception to the lessons one has to learn growing up and apart from his heritage.  Being under the advisement of an elder, one has the promise to regain his or her confidence in the old way, and has the hope of getting back on the right road.

This movie is a good example to all who are at that age where trying to gain ""independence"" is more important then the consequences when they disconnect.  We all are in this life together, like a web weaved so gently.  Sooner or later we all come to our own conclusions, but only one truth.  We are all connected.

Any movie with Graham Greene in it always proves to me to be a winner..

Thank you",1200614400,72,853,4.24223602484472

Love is stronger than hate and forgiveness brings unity of spirit. Peace comes thru love and pride of family and traditions of the same.

1920677,4,B0000D0YWJ,"Most notable as the debut (in a part with a character name) of Adam Beach (Flag of Our Fathers, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee), this made-for-Canadian-tv movie is quite predictable, but buoyed by fine performances from the adolescent actors: Herbie Barnes in the lead role, Beach as his antagonist, and Michelle St. John as the apex of their love triangle.

Contrary to the Amazon description, Graham Greene is on hand as the wry local (to the Anishinabe, aka Ojibwe) radio announcer (Graham Greene) who has taken on raising the orphaned and anger-filled boy Adam Beach plays (Paul). The grandfather who is taking on his very alienated grandson (Barnes as Jesse) who resents being plucked from Winnipeg and plopped down on the reservation was played (well) by Gordon Tootoosis).

The adults are tactful and try to still the angry hearts of Paul and Jesse, while teaching respect for horses, elders, work, and the land.  Although the ending is pat and predictable, the actors made this an enjoyable as well as an unplifting movie. (It was filmed in Manitoba, from where Beach came.)
