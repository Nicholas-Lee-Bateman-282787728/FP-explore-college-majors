7888425,5,6305338965,"If you are into drum and bass than this should be required viewing.
It is a video about the people who molded the musical genre into what it is today.
This is a video about the infamous UK record label Metalheadz (founded by Goldie).
This documentary interviews many of the legendary artists on the label at that time such as Goldie, Dillinja (the bass wizard), Ed Rush and Optical, Grooverider, J Majik and many more; and it asks them about their perspectives on the musical genre and the history of drum and bass.
It also has interviews with other artists, who aren't on the label -- like Andy C (who now runs Ram Records)
I found this video to be very informative, especially if you ever wanted to know the origin of drum and bass.
The only bad part -- has not been re-released on DVD yet.",1087430400,,792,4.394557823129252

7888427,3,6305338965,"As a longtime d&b head, dj, and lover of all things Metalheadz I'm going to have to say that this video is pretty superficial and useless.  It provides little insight into the ""actual"" scene, or the  ""actual"" process of making the music.  Basically it's a long  advertisment for Goldie and his label-mates (nice to see everybody  nonetheless).  The editing and presentation is superb however.  The  soundtrack is nice too, but a bit of a no-brainer considering they just ran  through the Platinum Breakz compilations track by track.  Eye-candy and  ear-candy to the last, and is sure to satisfy any d&b aficionado with  time on their hands (I'd rather go to the club than watch TV though).  The  pointless go-cart scene made me cringe (I'm sorry but Randall scares me),  but the football scene was good for laughs.  I honestly wouldn't consider  this a ""movie"", or even a ""documentary"".  Think of it  as shameless self-promotion for a record label that truly diserves to  promote itself shamelessly.
May Kemistry rest in peace.",951782400,6,1027,4.929411764705883
7888428,4,6305338965,"For the most part, this is a great video, especially when you consider the lack of drum 'n bass videos out there.  But the go cart scenes were pretty useless.  I wish they would have spent more time in the studio with the  metalheadz posse.  the studio scenes are worth the price of the video.  all  in all, an enjoyable video for the hardcore drum 'n bass fan.",950227200,2,361,4.235294117647059
7888429,4,6305338965,"The majority of the video consists of person to person interviews with members of the Metalheadz crew. They give their thoughts on what the music means to them, what it has done for the people who listen, and how it has  changed over the years. The movie frequently takes you into the studio  where producers like Dillinja and Adam F give the viewer a briefing of the  complexity of ""cutting a track."" The entire video is accompanied  by anthems from Platinum Breakz 1 & 2, including Adam F's  ""Metropolis"". This movie really makes you think how serious and  intense the drum & bass scene really is. (especially for an American  like myself.) A hard hitting taste of U.K. flavor.",927504000,,679,4.65546218487395
