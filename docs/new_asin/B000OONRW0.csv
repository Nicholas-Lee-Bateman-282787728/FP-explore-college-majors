2797950,5,B000OONRW0,"An excellent and unique video, presented in a clear and concise manner. A flowing sequence which can be used just by itself, or incorporate techniques from it into any thai bodywork session.  Chucks attention to anatomical and clinical detail is impressive.  His emphasis is on proper alignment,body mechanics and working from your center.  There are numerous techniques that I have not seen in any other thai video.  I recommend it highly and as a thai practioner, find it an extremely valuable addition to my thai video library. It has expanded my range of techniques and options in my own practice.",1177113600,,601,4.98
2797951,5,B000OONRW0,"This is one of the best massage DVD's I've purchased.  The picture quality is excellent, the camera angles let you see the movement demonstrated clearly, the instructions are easy to follow and the pace is just right.  This DVD is stock full of great information and well worth the price. This DVD has expanded the repetoire of moves I learned in Thailand, especially for my larger and more athletic clients that like deeper pressure. I have been incorporating many of the techniques in my Thai massage with great results.

The only thing I wished was different as I watched the video was that the person Chuck was working on was a larger person.  It would have been nice to see how these techniques worked when the practitioner is smaller than the client or less flexible.  Having said that, though, I appreciated that the student model was used in cases where it wasn't possible to show the technique on the original model. I wrote to Mr. Duff and he did explain that in the HandsFree Thai class he offers, dealing with size differences is addressed more completely.  I highly recommend this video.

8185854,5,B000OONRW0,Excellent way to learn Thai moves - very well scripted and informative DVD.... we can't make the trip to Chicago to take Duff's classes so this is next best thing.,1494892800,,163,4.466666666666667
8185855,5,B000OONRW0,"Excellent resource.  I broke my hand, and a one-handed massage therapist is, well, still a massage therapist.  I started working with my feet, which are uniquely suited to holding a lot of force.  Well-made instructional resource.  Wish I could train with Chuck in person.",1483920000,,272,5.113636363636363

8185857,5,B000OONRW0,I found this video very useful for learning how to use less of my hands and more of my feet and other body parts to give thai massage without stressing out my joints.,1447804800,,166,4.0606060606060606

8185859,5,B000OONRW0,I was really impressed with Chuck Duff's Hands Free Thai Massage DVD. I am a very small therapist and these techniques may keep me from developing carpal tunnel from working on larger clients. I have tried these techniques on many of my friends and most of them find them really effective for relieving pain and relaxing.,1362268800,,321,4.75
8185860,5,B000OONRW0,"Chuck Duff is an excellent teacher.  I have been a Thai Massage Therapist for over 8 years and I often review these DVD's for inspiration. The hands free Thai has saved me from over using my upper body, particularly with larger clients. I use these techniques with many people as the broad pressure of a relaxed foot is very calming. If you are new to Thai Massage, you will be quite excited by the possibilities and if are a Thai Massage Therapist, I think you will be glad to have this.",1357948800,,488,4.362637362637362
8185861,5,B000OONRW0,"I am also from the Netherlands. I received a lot of training in Thai massage in the nineties and had a Thai massage practice for some time. I had to discontinue my massage activities due to knee injury and RSI issues.

I was delighted to find a product focussing on hands free massage. I love how the spirit of Thai massage shines through in this instruction based dvd. Great work.

Although I can not perform all the moves there is so much to choose from. I can now practice Thai massage again, without hurting my own body.

I would highly recommend this product.",1197331200,2,564,4.456310679611651
8185862,5,B000OONRW0,"I am from Holland, and I am a Shiatsu-therapist. I use already some barefoot technique in my treatments, but was looking for more. This dvd showes clearly some very useful en elegant techniques. I find Chuck Duff a very dedicated person who can explain and show these beautiful techniques in a very relaxed and clear way. I love the way he works from the core, which I learned too. in Japanese it is called Hara. You can tell he has a lot of experience and knowledge of the ancient arts.
I can highly recommend this DVD!",1186358400,4,520,4.427083333333333
