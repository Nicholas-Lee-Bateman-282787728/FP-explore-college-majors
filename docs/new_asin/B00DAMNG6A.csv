8591110,1,B00DAMNG6A,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be a good, quick 15 minute head to toe workout that I could fit into my busy schedule.  There are six different workouts that are supposed to be 15 minutes each, but he does the same five or so moves over and over, each for 30 seconds with a 15 second rest in between each, and that all doesn't include his talking and demonstrating in between.  It may be 15 minutes of working out, but from start to finish, it's more like 20-25.  Then you tack on the 7 minutes of stretching he says to do everyday, you have a 30 minute plus workout.  Also, throughout,  he does one standing exercise, then one where you're lying on the mat, then back up standing and then lying down again.  During the rest period, instead of resting you will be scrambling to get into position, and at the end, dizzy from getting up and down constantly.  The cardio section is only 5 minutes, and you are jumping up and down the whole time, working really hard, and again 15 second rests between each move.  Hopping around like a fool and then standing still.  Do they want you to have a heart attack?",1446422400,,1107,4.309178743961352
