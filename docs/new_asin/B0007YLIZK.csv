8054036,5,B0007YLIZK,I remember watching the Cannon Tales on the Disney channel when i was a little girl.  They were all so wonderfully done.  Why is it that they are so hard to find now?,1180224000,,166,4.0
8054037,4,B0007YLIZK,"This is with out a doubt the best version I have seen yet and ever will again more than likely! The disney version is super boring and uninteresting to me. I think this one's better cause the songs are better and the plot is more emotional and far more romantic to me. The acting is great too. This version is as close to the origional grimm fairy tale as you can get. For one the queen gets snow white with the corset,the comb,AND the apple. I could watch this over and over (and I have since recieving it on monday!)It was well worth the 59.99 I paid for it. I highly recomend this and the rest of the cannon movie tales",1118188800,2,622,4.148760330578512
8054038,5,B0007YLIZK,"I wish those who own the rights to these Canon Movie Tales would release them on DVD. Shelly Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre has recently released all of their movies on DVD. Why not these, too?

I have been searching for this movie since I first saw it on the Disney Channel as a young child. Why is it that these movies are so hard to find? What they play on the Disney channel now is a far cry from what it used to be. It's a shame.",1117065600,2,432,3.9655172413793105
8054039,5,B0007YLIZK,I have never forgotten about this film since I was small. I saw it on the disney channel and I've been searching for it ever since.,1112054400,,131,4.076923076923077
