None of that bleakness and nastiness that seems to be a ""must"" for shows these days. Smart writing and characters that are consistent and believable.

7743364,5,B01F4O91WY,"What a great series. Nothing of the usual horrors of other popular shows. This show actually had (unbelievable I know) a happily MARRIED couple, working on their marriage through all kinds of tests. Television does not like married couples, they are all either with an idiot father and smart alek kids or on the way to a divorce. Royal Pains had happiness and self-sacrifice, nobility and soul-searching. So disappointed that they had to cancel the show, but that says a lot about what makes money for the networks nowadays... Just a very pleasant experience, with great views of beautiful houses and clothes.",1478563200,,609,4.980392156862745

7743384,3,B01F4O91WY,"Disappointing 8th
So far we've watched 4 episodes of this last season of a show we've watched with enjoyment for 7 seasons.  What happened?  We could speculate plenty, but to what end?  We're tired of Even's self centered immaturity and groan worthy screw-ups; Hank's frustrating failure to get ""life""; Paige's fake unnaturally saccharine disposition; and we hope to never see Eddie again!  We will probably skip to the finale....just because we are a little curious about some other character's and plot points.",1475452800,,512,5.2073170731707314

7743388,3,B01F4O91WY,Do NOT BUY the whole series! Buy individually all the episodes except for episode 7. This episode was full of a whole lot of badly performed singing and dancing and contributed nothing to the series. A palliative would be if one had a fast internet so that one can fast-forward through the more excruciating bits; unfortunately my internet is not fast so had to use the mute button and treat some of the episode like an ad. and walk away from the tv.,1474848000,2,450,4.433734939759036

You'll have to watch and see.  And there are one or two of the most interesting MacGyver medical interventions of the series.  Sad to see Royal Pains end.,1470528000,4,314,4.830188679245283
7743436,5,B01F4O91WY,"The greatest thing about the last season was the return of Jill Flint for a couple of show reprising her role as Hank's love interest.  She was let go a few seasons back so the producers could find a better love interest and it was satisfying for the producers to quietly admit there wasn't one with her return.  They tied things up nicely except for that musical they did second to the last episode, but otherwise, nice send off for a good show.",1470528000,3,446,4.36144578313253
7743437,5,B01F4O91WY,"Absolutely loved this show. Sad it has ended, but looking forward to seeing all actors in new shows hopefully!!",1470182400,,111,4.894736842105263
7743438,5,B01F4O91WY,"I think everyone knew it was coming.  Two years ago, the USA Network renewed Royals Pains for season 7 and 8, but each season would only be eight episodes.  While they waited until this spring to officially announce that season 8 would be the final season, I wasn't surprised to hear the announcement.  However, the writers and creators took advantage of this news to craft a wonderful final season that will leave all fans thrilled.

As this season opens, its the start of a new summer, and the HankMed gang is getting ready for business as usual.  Hank Lawson (Mark Feuerstein) has a new potential girlfriend.  His brother Evan (Paulo Costanzo) is still trying to balance the demands of HankMed and his job running the hospital.  Meanwhile he and his wife Paige (Brooke DOrsay) are still trying to have a child.  Dr. Jeremiah Sacani (Ben Shenkman) is attempting to get back to treating patients after spending most of the year in the lab.  And physician assistant Divya Katdare (Reshma Shetty) is anxiously waiting for word on getting into medical school while expecting a child with her new husband  Raj (Rupak Ginn).

While the HankMed gang deals with all this going on in their lives, Hank accompanies Boris (Campbell Scott) on a trip to Hong Kong, Jeremiah treats his favorite author, and we meet a family of kids who need help.

But there is definitely change in the air.  First, Hank and Evans father Eddie (Henry Winkler) reappears announcing his upcoming marriage to Ms. Newburg (Christine Ebersole) before he vanishes.  Then a surprise reappearance from Jill (Jill Flint) captures Hanks interest again.  Are things changing for our characters?  Where will everyone end up?

Yes, there really are only 8 episodes in the season, and they are jam packed full.  As always, the emphasis is as much if not more on what is going on with the characters as it is the medical mystery of the week.  Oh, we get some new clients and their ailments, but we tune in because of these characters.

And the final episode nails why.  (No, Im not going to spoil anything.)  These characters are a family.  They have stood by each other through thick and thin, and they truly care for each other.  Oh, they may fight and have disagreements (we do need conflict on a TV show after all), but they work things out in the end.  I have loved watching their relationships grow and change as the characters grew over these eight seasons.  For fans like me, this didn't disappoint.

Which brings us to the final episode.  It was perfect!  Im actually a little surprised I didn't bawl all the way through it, but there were so many wonderful moments between the characters as everything was wrapped up.  And I am absolutely thrilled with how they wrapped things up for the characters.

Since the writers were treating it as a final season, they brought in quite a few past characters for cameos.  Many of them showed up in the musical episode, which was a lot of fun.  And let me just say, the female cast is super talented.  The men hold their own when it came to singing, but the ladies shine.

Of course, Im going to keep the praise going by talking about the great acting.  The stars and the recurring actors nail their parts once again.  The guest stars rise to the occasion as well.

If you are a fan of this show, youll be thrilled with how it ended.  Buy Royal Pains Season 8 today so you can enjoy it over and over again.",1469836800,3,3411,4.593698175787728

If so the finale of Pains will leave you spent but happy as the lovable cast and crew say goodbye to the Hamptons (the show's creators pop up as Crab Shack employees).

7743528,3,B01F4O91WY,"There is a limit to how many innovative medical procedures will interest the audience, after a while it becomes rather stale, simply losing the element of surprise.

 I predict the Henry will buy the house ,settle down, perhaps take a permanent position in the ER, yeh he will also find love & get married.

As for Evin & Paige, they will finaly  have a child, though if I were to write the script , they would not concieve before Hank marries & his wife gets pregnant immediately, giving birth to a healthy premi. Its just to much for Evin to handle his brother having a child before him, despite the fact the he & Paige had married way before him.

With the Lawson babby in the hospital for over a month & Dad in the ER, everyone kicks in especially Paige ,stoking her desire to have a child of her own into a mighty force  & she begins to conceive a plan to encourage Evin to agree they adobt.

The perfect baby for Paige is not readily available for adoption and the adoption process takes over their lives to the point that Evin struggles with his hospital responsibilities, promting Henry to come to the rescue.

Ultimately Boris and his wife die, yes really die this time & with Henry being the baby's godfather , he takes custody of the orphaned child. Naturally, Boris's wealth including the Hampton home is willed to Henry, (Evin does get a car & the guest house).

With a baby of their own and another on the way, Henry ans his wife decide to have Paige and Evin adapt the Boris baby (sorry, I won't even attempt the last name) furtheremore, you know Henry's humble nature? well his wife is another pea in the pod & they give ""the house"" at Shadow pond to Paige and Evon.

Hank is pretty content with his newfound wealth, and life takes it course as he is back in the ER despite his ability to never work again, but wait, there is one thing that keeps nagging at the back of his mind. He is determined to buy the New York hospital that it all began at, and finaly put some folks where they belong, out on the street. His chance to take revenge becomes his sweet new obsession and he is torn between his good nature and this new urge for revenge that he blames on his wealth .

I would tell you what happens next, but I must leave you with some suspense.",1466467200,2,2264,4.303529411764706

7743548,2,B01F4O91WY,"Its taken a turn for the worse.  The story line is getting repetitive while bordering on the fantastic at times.  Seriously, Hank's love life has been the same through all 8 seasons.  The whole Boris foreign intrigue thing is getting silly.
