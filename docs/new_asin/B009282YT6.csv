5243209,5,B009282YT6,I think this is the first video to explore the ideas of The Fourth Way. This high-quality video was shot at a seminar of Patterson's with the dialogues showing the interactivity and seriousness of the teacher-student relationship. The video explores in depth fundamental ideas and practices of Gurdjieff's teaching. I've watched it many times and with every additional viewing I have found something new that was previously missed.,1347235200,14,431,5.352941176470588
8534691,5,B009282YT6,"Having read many books about Gurdjieff and having some experience in Gurdjieff groups I came to this DVD wondering if it would add anything to my understanding. My expectations were definitely exceeded. There is a lot more food here than is available in books, and for me it took a lot of attention and effort to digest. Not that it is difficult to understand, just that it is so concentrated and intense.
There are three talks which contain many pearls of wisdom and are amazingly rich. They apparently were given to Pattersons students at one of his seminars and, in a way, he presents not just ideas presented by Gurdjieff, but actually takes the listener through the method of applying the teaching to ones own life.
I thought that all of the talks are worth repeated viewings but watching them all (at different times, there is too much here to be able to take in at a single sitting) added up to a powerful experience of the depth and breadth of Gurdjieffs teaching.",1467763200,,972,4.624277456647399
8534692,5,B009282YT6,"The film is an informative four part lecture series spanning the origins of Gurdjieff's teachings to the role of technology in modern spiritual development. As someone relatively new to the ideas and concepts of the Fourth Way, I found the descriptions and explanations very comprehensible: embodiment, centers, self-observation, and so forth. I found myself pausing the film to scribble down notes throughout. There's a lot to absorb in the film. I will watch again.",1467331200,,467,5.324324324324325
8534693,5,B009282YT6,"William Patrick Patterson, author of numerous books on The Fourth Way and a spiritual teacher in the Bay Area, has created a fantastic DVD, one where the many essential aspects of being are shared in the form of four 50-minute talks with student interaction, and in a manner reminiscent of a fireside chatgently persuasive, direct, with humor/seriousness both keeping the listeners with him. The four talks include present-day consciousness and the influences working against it, images of god and machines, the science of being, and faith of consciousness. Although I found these talks best taken in over more than one sitting, I appreciated this author's perspectives, especially his perspective on technology. Technology, he ascribes, is actually the rational part of us developed to an extreme, and, in the lingo of this tradition, one-centered. The spiritual significance is that in giving into technology's power, we unwittingly adapt to its level of functioning rather than our ownwith the loss of our collective humanity and our own opportunity to evolve spiritually. The presenter further suggests that to resist this outcome for ourselves, we need to come to know who we really are, a journey one can begin only by learning to listen to the body. [Side Note: If you prefer reading,  ""Spiritual Survival in a Radically Changing World Time"" introduces similar topics in a more comprehensive way].

That talks definitely pull you in, especially if you're after a keener understanding of human growth and open to a principle tenet of The Fourth Waythe possibility of evolving through simultaneous work on three centers: the mind, emotions and body.  For me, I found the talks served as an excellent introduction to what spiritual evolution looks like, and a good investment in myself.",1465862400,,1790,5.229965156794425
8534694,2,B009282YT6,Wasn't what I thought it would be. More on his life than his philosophy.,1463356800,,72,4.214285714285714

8534696,1,B009282YT6,"This DVD is a series of talks by this guy William Patterson; my impression is that he considers himself an heir to Gurdjieff; he even looks sort of like him.  The problem I had is as follows: there is a total lack of critical thought in this dvd.  What you hear is that there is one truth tht Gurdeiff discovered and everyone who doesn't get it isn't awake.  A few things struck me: first, the strident outlook very similar to Objectivism (Ayn Rand) or fundamentalism (of any kind) or scientology....each school has interesting things to say and elements of truth but they present themselves as the ultimate truth.  Gurdieff is presented as completely infallible which is presented as a conclusion.  Second, in the lectures one sees the audience and it struck me that none of these devotees appeared very happy or healthy.  Lots of scowls and middle aged men...it struck me that these are lost souls desperate for answers whose mental makeup makes some esoteric absolute truth appealing.  Third, there is a disturbing self righteous quality about Patterson.  He does not seem physically healthy, sort of overweight and pasty, and I'd think if one found the ultimate answers to life one would reflect that in ones physical body...at least not be overweight.  He seems like a guy who wants control and found a shtick to have his own little universe.  For a critical exploration of Gurdieff this is not the DVD to get (I don't think there are any) but fawning devotees with no critical thought looking for absolutist answers from what seemed to me to be a wanabee cult leader, it should appeal.",1413072000,7,1591,4.773722627737226
8534697,5,B009282YT6,"Why is suffering the last thing we will give up?  And why is this suffering unique to me...and what ""me"" is that? These were some of the many questions that this video called up. I felt I was getting a genuine view of G.I. Gurdjieff's teaching, ""The Work,"" as embodied and obviously lived by William Patrick Patterson, longtime student of Lord John Pentland of that remarkable man Gurdjieff appointed to lead the Work in America.  The dialogues occurred at a seminar so nothing is canned. The exchanges between Patterson and the audience are strikingly direct and honest, as people are brought to questions like the ""self"" or ""I"" of the moment, and how to say ""no"" to mechanical life and ""yes"" to what is? And this was only Part I. Can't wait for Part II.",1347926400,8,755,4.5851851851851855
8534698,5,B009282YT6,"Nowhere have I come across such a clear and accessible exposition of the fundamental principles of The Fourth Way as in the lectures and accompanying dialogues on this DVD. William Patrick Patterson explains the key practices of the teaching, self-remembering and self-observation, in a detailed manner that is not available in any Fourth Way book I have read, and I have read widely.  Patterson actually leads the audience into an experience of themselves as they are and not as they imagine themselves to be, and then deeper into an experience of Consciousness itself. The third lecture, entitled The Science of Being, is a primer for anyone seriously interested in understanding the origins of Gurdjieff's Fourth Way, its relationship to world religions, and the uniqueness of its core teachings. I strongly recommend this video to anyone who wishes to experience the depth and richness of The Fourth Way.",1347926400,10,908,5.1768707482993195
8534699,5,B009282YT6,"Patterson's latest DVD release is in some way an extension of and fleshing out of Patterson's book: ""Spiritual Survival in a Radically Changing World-Time."" In this DVD the viewer is given a unique look and taste of three extemporaneous talks by an authentic teacher of The Fourth Way. The viewer is presented with extensive question and answer periods after each talk. Patterson answers questions related to the talk and varied experiences of the students. The DVD subject matter surrounds the essential question of the ""self."" The Fourth Way being a work in the world the material shown is of a more experiential nature and not overly intellectualized. This gives the viewer a taste of the world of the many selves of man. These ""selves,"" or as they are more commonly called ""I's,"" need to be seen and understood before there is the possibility that the many selves can become one individual self and beyond. The over all effect of the material presented is a slice of Fourth Way teaching as one might experience it in an authentic Fourth Way group. To the reviewer's knowledge this type of material is not available in a visual format from any other source. This is a valuable DVD for not only the serious student of the Fourth Way, but also for the merely curious person who may have found the ideas presented in various Fourth Way related books to be intriguing.",1347840000,9,1367,4.772151898734177
8534700,5,B009282YT6,"This video gives one a taste of various aspects of what has been, heretofore, only available to 4th way students. Much is given.

I liked the question posed--- To Be Here? Actual methods and techniques are explained in detail. Having read several books on the teachings of Gurdjieff, it was immediately recognized there is critical material here that was not in the books.

The role of sustained attention, embodiment, will and wish are explored in relation to Self Remembering and Impartial Self Observation. I liked the student questions. Serious and to the point except one that got a little tedious. Highly recommended for serious students of the 4th Way.",1347321600,12,659,5.036697247706422
