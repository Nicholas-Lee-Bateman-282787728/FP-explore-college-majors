4653208,4,B005CFC04C,"Yes, this Hallmark Channel movie does take place during the Thanksgiving Holiday, but it's really about considering one's place in life and what's important or meaningful.

A driven, successful, single lawyer(Zuniga),apparently happy, and against her desires, gets transported to an alternative lifestyle through the magic of a ""Transpersonal Psychologist""(Dunaway).  She's now married with kids, husband and the rigors of motherhood with potty training, feeding and teaching the kids, helping her husband seek his true career, bonding again with her homemaker sister and deciding for herself what's she really wants in life.

Of course, this has all been done before, but it's hilarious to watch as she struggles with day to day life, out of her element, with what we as moms and dads, especially moms, know so well.

The actors perform well, the children, super!  It's good to see Faye Dunaway at work even if she only pops in for brief but important bits.

This is comedy with some romance, a touch of drama and a lot of sentiment.  Predictable (which of these films are not?)it's fun and warm.  There's no violence, language, sex- well, as the married woman, she does remove the shirt of her muscular, handsome husband as a prelude to unshown events.  Overall, the film is family friendly.  Happy Thanksgiving!",1322092800,11,1314,5.126760563380282

4653232,3,B005CFC04C,"I plan activities for our senior apartment complex, and enjoyed the movie but was somewhat disappointed that there was little about Thanksgiving until the end.

The movie was cute - a corporate woman lawyer who is anti marriage and children for herself is zapped into the future to see what life could be like if she were to have children.  There are many funny scenes, but the movie had more Christmas than Thanksgiving in it.",1417132800,2,427,4.68

4653245,4,B005CFC04C,"We can't ever have enough of them alternate timeline stories, am I right? I sat thru 2010's A Family Thanksgiving and walked away pretty satisfied. My old crush, Daphne Zuniga, still holds it down. Career-driven trial lawyer Claudia Parks (Zuniga) has no time for the holidays. She, in fact, expects her staff to work thru Thanksgiving. She's been ducking the firm's enigmatic transpersonal psychologist (Faye Dunaway) as Claudia, as well, has no time to for the touchy-feely couch session. And just in case you'd allowed that ""transpersonal psychologist"" bit to pass you by unchallenged, it's a hint that there may be something not quite normal at play.

Just two of the many ways in which Claudia - alumna of Harvard law, graduated top of her class - is oblivious to the important things in life: One) When her sister's baby was born, Claudia sent over a Harvard sweatshirt in lieu of showing up in person. Two) Her firm's latest client is a German-based manufacturer that plans to raze the local family park to erect a mill. Claudia is tasked with punching holes in an injunction submitted by concerned townspeople, never mind that her own sister (Gina Holden) is horrified at losing the park.

Minutes into the film, Claudia Parks is magically transported to an altered reality in which she's married and had years ago given up her law career to raise her kids. This other Claudia is the perfect mom and wife. And our Claudia, abruptly thrust into domesticity, finds herself coping with her three-year-old daughter's potty training and her pre-teen son's awful grades. And then to demonstrate that some plot points do run parallel, she has to contend with her old firm's going to court to challenge the townpeople's injunction against the looming park demolition. Which side will Claudia back? Has she settled in too comfortably as the suburban housewife? Can she brush off her old lawyery skills and go fight the power? Oh, hey, here comes that weird transpersonal psychologist again.

3.5 out of 5 stars for A Family Thanksgiving, a genial holiday film for the entire family. The funny bits are primarily courtesy of Daphne Zuniga's comically flustered behavior as she tries to make hearth and home for her unexpected husband and children. The plot wends its way down an expected path, not that I minded.  You have to be a willing participant; you have to be a savvy sucker. During the holidays, you've got to be a massive grinch to not enjoy these feel-good films, to not root for our empty-hearted protagonist to change her ways.",1388361600,,2537,4.8930232558139535
4653246,5,B005CFC04C,This is a great movie about the older times ! Proverty was a real issue! As a women with Children lost her Husband She could lose a very simple House ! Food still needs to be grown & the Mother of the daughter has money & Her grand Daughter is talented with writting! She writes Her  Grand mother & This helps lead into the Christmas Movie that us very good also!,1388275200,,363,4.112676056338028
4653247,5,B005CFC04C,I really enjoy just about every holiday movie. Anything that brings the family together during the busy holidays is worth the cost to me. We'll be making this movie part of our Thanksgiving tradition.,1388275200,,200,4.911764705882353
4653248,3,B005CFC04C,"It's like one of the Hallmark made for tv movies.  Enjoyable, but not great.
I was hoping it would be a little better than it was.  Not sure how ""re-watchable"" it'll be.",1387238400,,169,4.25
4653249,5,B005CFC04C,"I ordered this last year while in the Christmas movie buying spirit. I think Thanksgiving had already passed so it was a long time before I watched it. However, I've watched it twice this year so obviously I like it. I was surprised to see Faye Dunaway again and she was probably the main reason I ordered it. I had not seen her in anything lately and she is important to the plot of the movie but we don't see a lot of her. This is not an unusual storyline. So many of the movies have someone who lost a loved one around this time of the year or they are so busy with their career that they don't think about any of the holidays. This movie falls into the category of work, only it's one of two that have the plot with a woman and no ghost that got them there. I think the part I liked best was how the super busy lawyer was constantly putting down her sister who is a stay-at-home Mom. The lawyer thinks her job is her life and she believes her sister does nothing and has lots of time. It's nice to see working at home Mom's vindicated as the super sister learns there is more to life than her job and her sister is extremely busy and being a Mom is just as important as her life as a lawyer. Unlike most of these movies, the lawyer did not give up a love to take her job but in the life ""Gina"" (Faye Dunaway) takes her to, her husbands a man she only met once. It's a movie about choices and while the ending is much like the others made like this, there is a surprise twist in the way it gets there. It's a nice enjoyable family movie while you're in this spirit of the holidays.",1385856000,,1584,4.031746031746032
4653250,5,B005CFC04C,"Admittedly, I have a weakness for the Hallmark Channel's holiday fare but most of their movies are merely decent, lighthearted fluff. This is, however, one of the few legitimately good ""feel good"" movies. It has broad appeal as it is both a family drama and a romantic drama and it has comedic elements as well. Is this an original story? No, no by a longshot (think ""Overboard"" meets ""A Christmas Carol"" and that other Hallmark movie with Nancy McKeon) but it's actually pretty well written, Daphne Zuniga does a great job and overall it's thoroughly enjoyable lighthearted fluff.",1385510400,,581,4.938775510204081
4653251,5,B005CFC04C,Great movie. I normally buy movies to watch during holidays and this one did not disappoint. It is very entertaining and the DVD is good quality. I watch it again and again and it is a welcome addition to my collection of movies.,1378425600,,229,4.348837209302325

4653253,5,B005CFC04C,"Okay, this is a Hallmark ""feel good"" movie and due to that, everything is just predictable. The movie starts really slow and catches up half way through... Not sure, but it looks like Daphne was having problems with her legs for her gait looks very uneasy and unstable in several scenes of the movie.",1369872000,3,300,4.574074074074074
4653254,5,B005CFC04C,This movie is an eye opener about what's important and different directions to take with your life.  Career vs Family.  I would recommend this to everyone.  It's about the trials of being a mother and wife when you've always been career-oriented.  Family dynamics at its best.,1366416000,,276,4.934782608695652
4653255,5,B005CFC04C,"I love this movie,  It has just enough drama added to the romance and is a wonderful rainy afternoon getaway.",1366070400,,109,4.45
4653256,2,B005CFC04C,"and I shouldn't have taken a chance. Based on the description, I was hoping it would be G rated. However, it is not appropriate for younger (under 12?) children. There are sexual references, etc. I ended up just giving it away. For the price, it wasn't worth sending back. Additionally, it was fairly derivative of quite a few other movies.",1365552000,,340,4.683333333333334
4653257,5,B005CFC04C,This is a nice movie and I saw it a while back and ran across it when I was searching for Christmas movies I wanted to purchase.  I'm glad to have this in my library,1363564800,,165,3.7142857142857144
4653258,5,B005CFC04C,"A Family Thanksgiving was a good movie that I've watched more than 2 or 3 times.  The entire family can watch this movie;  no violence, no foul language, no nudity.  Just a good movie to add to anyone's collection.",1361059200,3,214,4.435897435897436
4653259,3,B005CFC04C,"we enjoy different holiday movies and this, to watch on thanksgiving, was acceptable and we do watch it each year.  it had a happy ending and that's always nice.",1358467200,,161,4.551724137931035
4653260,5,B005CFC04C,"My wife lives for November and December with Hallmark Movies.  This one will not disappoint as it follows the formula to a T!  My wife saw about 80% of the movie, but lost a portion.  We ordered it for her so she would not have to wait a year to see how it ended.:)

There were some cute parts but the main character cursed a few times in front of children. Then she made a comment to her friend ""so I hope this doesn't mean he is going to want birthday sex"". Then another scene the couple passionately kisses while undressing one another. Fortunately I Googled reviews while watching and found that it contained this and was able to skip to the end to avoid it. Being a ""family movie"" I would have thought these things would NOT be in the movie. I would not have purchased this had I known.",1354060800,9,676,4.248062015503876
4653266,3,B005CFC04C,"I am a teacher and bought this to show my 6th and 7th grade students before the holiday.  It's a good thing I previewed it first!  There was a scene where two characters were frantically trying to remove their clothes for a sex scene, and there was a reference to that time of the month.  There were too many of these types of  instances that made me decide that there was no way I could show it at school.  Waste of money.  It was not the sweet ""feel good"" movie that I had hoped for at all.  It's going to Good Will!",1353888000,13,518,4.019607843137255
