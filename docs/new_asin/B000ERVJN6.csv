2530773,4,B000ERVJN6,"Charlie Brown and Snoopy and the rest take viewers on an eight episode tour of highlights in America's history (well, seven, and one look to the future, at Nasa's then current plans of a manned space station, which here becomes a fun adventure for the Peanuts kids.)  The best of these episodes put Charlie Brown and the rest into entertaining retellings of events in history, such as The Birth of the Constitution and The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, or have the kids talking to historical figures like Alexander Graham Bell and Abraham Lincoln. Some of the episodes try to cover perhaps a bit too much material through narration by Charlie Brown and the others, which takes a bit away from episodes like The Mayflower Voyagers and The Building of the Transcontinental Railroad.  The mini-series ends with a look at The Music and Heroes of America, in a co-production by Schroeder and Lucy (which was certainly NOT Schroeder's idea!)  This was certainly a departure for Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez's long line of TV specials based on Schulz's famous comic strip, but for the most part they turned out well.  In a few of these episodes, the drawing is a little sloppy, but not totally unwatchable.  There are a lot of good character moments in these shows as well as all those facts...Snoopy and woodstock trying on powdered wigs in the Constitution episode, Charlie Brown loaning Ben Franklin a kite, Lucy pulling her old football gag on Charlie Brown in the Nasa Space Station and a lot more...One of my favorite parts is seeing just who drove the golden spike that connected the railroads (according to Schulz, anyway) I won't spoil it here, watch it yourself!",1150848000,8,1669,4.821678321678322

2530775,5,B000ERVJN6,"This is a great way to teach your children about American history.  This Is America, Charlie Brown was an 8 part miniseries in 1988-89.  In it, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Peppermint Patty, Sally, Lucy, Linus, Marcie and others travelled back in time to witness events like the dreary Mayflower voyage, the signing of the Constitution, Ben Franklin discovering electricity, the Depression of the 1930's, the building of the Transcontinental Railroad and the Wright brothers' 1st flight.  In addition, the Peanuts gang took a trip in outer space, travelled to the Smithsonian Institution, paid tribute to many American musicians like Scott Joplin and Stephen Foster and got to meet George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Henry Ford, Squanto, Alexander Graham Bell and others.  Some ""purists"" may object to the showing of adults in an animated special but the caricatures of some of the famous historical figures look like something Charles Schulz would've drawn.  This features music from Dave Brubeck, George Winston, the Winans, Lou Rawls, Ed Bogas, Wynton Marsalis, David Grusin and David Benoit (and of course, lots of standards from the late Vince Guaraldi).  Enjoy the history lesson and try to be patient until July, when this video collection is released!",1143676800,55,1254,5.308080808080808
2530786,5,B000ERVJN6,Years ago when my son was small this series was on TV in several installments over several weeks.  I taped some of them on VHS but didn't have them all.  Years of watching the VHS tapes took their toll and I was very happy to find this on dvd.

2530789,5,B000ERVJN6,"This is an excellent, fun introduction to American history for children and kids-at-heart who want to share it with them.  Can it be re-released so it is affordable to families?  Americans need to revisit
our pride in our history, and this is a great way to start.  At schools, very little patriotism is taught anymore -- it's all washed out with PC mentality.  We're taught America was and is a bad place.
Sure, mistakes were made in our founding and expansion, but no nation is perfect. I think this week we just saw what kind of country we are -- or at least what kind of city Boston is -- in the response
to the massacre at the Boston Marathon.  Ordinary citizens and first-responders risked their lives to save those of others.  The Peanuts team has captured that colonial and pioneering spirit here.
Please, please bring this series back, and make it available to the masses.",1366416000,2,881,4.615384615384615

Even in the 21st century, the uniqueness of these characters appeals to our youth.  Inserting the Peanuts kids into historical situations helped my 5th grade students comprehend, and hopefully, remember more. The script writers did their research homework and the episodes were well done.",1338508800,,416,5.303030303030303
2530792,5,B000ERVJN6,I found 3 of these videos at a sale on VHS and was looking for the rest when I came across the DVDs. WOOOHOOO!!!

When it was originally issued it sold for about $20 - $90 or so for this copy is highway robbery.

2530794,5,B000ERVJN6,"This Is America Charlie Brown is an amazing set of Peanuts episodes dealing with well-known (or at least they should be well-known) events in U.S. history.  I bought this to use as filler material at the school I work at.  The students have lunch in their classrooms at least once per month and when this occurs they watch movies while they eat.  My second graders LOVED this series.  After they had watched all the episodes, they were BEGGING for more Charlie Brown!",1308614400,,467,4.658536585365853
2530795,5,B000ERVJN6,"I teach first grade, and I used The Mayflower Voyagers to help my students understand why we celebrate Thanksgiving. It really held their attention and complimented what I taught. The discs were in good condition and shipping was extremely timely!!!!",1292371200,,250,5.275
2530806,3,B000ERVJN6,"In the late 1980's, eight Peanuts specials were produced where the Peanuts gang were able to become a part of historical events.  Each disc contains four of the specials.  Disc one contains ""The Mayflower Voyagers"" (which is also available on the original DVD pressing of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving), ""The Birth of the Constitution,"" ""The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk,"" and ""The NASA Space Station.""  Disc two contains ""The Building of the Transcontinental Railroad,"" ""The Great Inventors,"" ""The Smithsonian and the Presidency,"" and ""The Music and Heroes of America.""

Unfortunately, all you get on these DVDs are the specials themselves.  There are absolutely no special features included.  I personally think there were plenty of options that Paramount could have used as bonus features (such as interviews with individuals who worked on these specials, commentary tracks, or trivia that ties in to the topics presented in each special).

The specials themselves are very informative, but they definitely have a different style when compared to the typical Peanuts specials.  Expect younger children to become bored with these specials rather quickly.  Older children can probably better understand them and can probably have a better appreciation for them, but even they may grumble a little when watching these.

I applaud what was trying to be accomplished by producing these specials, but I think adult fans of the Peanuts will overall have a greater appreciation and enjoyment for them than children will.

I wrote this review of the copy of this set that my husband and I purchased.",1290038400,3,1593,5.256916996047431
2530807,5,B000ERVJN6,"I know there are people who barely remember these when they came out but since I am presently living in the U.K. with my hubby , it is GREAT way to teach the kids (youngsters) about the U.S.A. and keep them glued to the television.  I forot alot of things about MY own history which were mentioned in this set, such as in the Apollo Space craft episode and that bit about good ol Charlie Brown and Snoopy bit ( ya have to watch it yaself) ...THAT took me back years in school rooms far away. It is a great deal for the price although it may seem out of date for the times we live in today it is a definite MUST HAVE for any Charlie Brown and Snoopy fan!!  If it bores you than you are definitely NOT a TRUE die hard fan!",1283644800,,720,3.9586206896551723
2530808,4,B000ERVJN6,"I remember watching these when I was a kid. The specific ones I remember were: Transcontinental Railroad, Mayflower Voyagers, Wright Brothers, and very little of the inventors one.

Those 3 alone are a good reason to get it. I specifically remember as a kid being more engaged in learning that history because it had my favorite characters on the big screen telling me about it and I could retain that information better than a social studies textbook. Parents should get this for their kids so they can learn American History, and Peanuts fans should get this too.

That concludes my review but there is one scene I want to have addressed and want someone to respond to confirm this or deny it.

When I watched Mayflower Voyagers as a kid and compared that to watching it on tv today or on a holiday collection dvd, there was a distinct difference.

I specifically remember the scene where Squanto (excuse the spelling) leads the indians to the turkey that they have later for dinner. He points at the turkey, says shh, then the turkey disappears in a cloud of smoke. My parents were good and told me straight that they shot the turkey and the smoke means he died.

On the dvd, squanto says shh and it stays on his face the entire time the turkey is shot.

A difference as small as that can be very annoying to a die hard peanuts fan as myself. So what I'm wondering for anyone that owns this set (because I want to at some point) is: does the turkey get shot or not on the This is American dvd set?",1265587200,,1500,4.416666666666667
2530809,5,B000ERVJN6,This is one of the most entertaining and educational videos that I have watched with my child.

We borrowed the video a couple more times after that and they are still not tired of viewing it, so I decided to purchase one. The characters are cute and they thought were funny. To this day, it is still one of their most favorite DVD.",1209081600,,447,4.149425287356322
2530823,5,B000ERVJN6,This is an excellent addition to any family DVD collection.  I especially recommend it for home schooling families and any family interested in reinforcing a child's education in American history!,1200182400,,196,5.533333333333333
2530824,5,B000ERVJN6,I use this video before the holidays when the students are the least bit interested in me and only thinking about the holidays and their time off.  This grabs their attention and is factually correct.  Great aid in the classroom.,1198627200,2,229,4.7

2530826,5,B000ERVJN6,"I first saw this DVD at Camp Snoopy at Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.  I decided to check prices online.  Amazon had a much lower price with free shipping.  I ordered it without hesitation. I like watching Peanuts with my 2 yr old son.  He likes Charlie Brown and Snoopy. He enjoys the silliness of the characters.  I like it not only for it's dialogue, but this series has tid bits of American history that I found interesting as well. It may be a bit advanced for my young one to understand. Nonetheless, we both get our thrills plus our father and son time watching this DVD together.  Who ever said you can't learn anything from cartoons?  I definitely recommend Peanuts to all parents to show to their kids.  It's timeless and safe for the whole family.",1174262400,,772,4.503597122302159

2530829,5,B000ERVJN6,"I purchased this DVD for my 6 year old grandson. He thoroughly enjoyed it.  He wants to watch it over and over and I think that he has learned a great deal from the different segments.  His favorite is the Space Station selection, but he likes all of the segments.  I enjoy watching this DVD with him.  I am delighted that he can respond to the quieter and more thoughtful pace of the Charlie Brown DVDs.",1161993600,3,404,4.276315789473684
2530830,4,B000ERVJN6,"Let's face it, Peanuts has been slow getting onto DVD. Fortunately the holiday specials are out (and on the DVDs include extra shows). I'm still waiting for The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show from 1983 to hit DVD. Some viewers didn't like it, but I did because even when it missed (and it often hit) it had the same pacing as the comic (as did Garfield and Friends which began in 1988) which is so distinctive of the best Peanuts specials.

These eight specials ran on Nick under the umbrella title ""You're on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown"" and made it out on VHS. This double DVD set saves more than $60 off the cost of the VHS videos. Pardon the 'e' word, but it's very educational. The shows are very different one from another. I very much liked the NASA space station show, which is sort of like a Peanuts take on the History Channel. But this set costs less than two of the VHS tapes, so it's like you get six shows free.

Of the 75 half hour Peanuts specials, some of the best had an educational bent, such as ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?"" about D-Day, which won a Peabody Award. The four best known specials are the feature length ones: ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"", ""Snoopy Come Home"", ""Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown"" and ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"". Then there was the live action Broadway musical, ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,"" which I saw recently in its current revival. Charles Schultz didn't originally like the name ""Peanuts"" which was foisted on him by the syndicate. But like that addictive snack food, at least some of us can't get enough of his comic creations. Here's hoping more of them make it to DVD soon.",1158105600,12,1643,4.510067114093959
2530831,5,B000ERVJN6,I have been a Peanuts fan for quite a few years now. I remember watching these on TV back when I was about 5 years old. I am happy this series is finally out on DVD and at such a great price. Bring back some good memories and happy times of my childhood.,1152144000,2,254,3.811320754716981
2530832,4,B000ERVJN6,"There are often times where the comics have done really well at projecting a great deal of joy and entertainment to so many young hearts. That has been the feeling with the Peanuts cast for so many eras. While the comic strips the late Charles Schultz have drawn for all throughout his lifetime, and until his retirement in 2000, continue to entertain al ages, the televisions specials have also gained a lot into the light as well such as A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Snoopy's Reunion. When it came to the moments of history, Schultz put them as if they were at those gracious eras too. Now, that series is on DVD for the first time.

This Is America Charlie Brown, the 1988 eight episode series take so many great moments as told by Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus and the rest of the Peanuts gang. The collection includes special moments from the original flights at Kitty Hawk from the Wright Brothers, to the moments of NASA and the history of space, and the moment the pilgrims have stepped off The Mayflower. The collection of episodes from the CBS mini-series has been restored very well, and the animation looks and sounds better than ever. It still continues to enetertain for all ages, and portraits a lot of history that still hasn't been described enough in classrooms today.

All in all, This Is America Charlie Brown is a great DVD package for anybody who loves the Peanuts series from television, or for anyone who hasn't yet read even the comic strips. I loved watching this when I was seven years old, and I still enjoy the shows today.

8113604,5,B000ERVJN6,"When I was a kid, history was a serious subject and schools were serious about teaching it. Today, it's rare to find a child who knows the civil war took place before WW2. This series teaches the basics of American history in an entertaining way using cartoon characters familiar to kids who will not sit in class and memorize dates and years. The best way to teach history is to inspire children to imagine themselves in those long ago places participating in the events. Sailing aboard the Mayflower, working in the building where the Founding Fathers argued over the wording of the Constitution, etc. is far better than rote memorizing of dull facts kids don't care about and will not remember. Any parent who wants their children to grow up with a solid knowledge of how this nation came to be should consider adding this DVD to their family TV watching as a means to that goal.",1515456000,,882,4.624203821656051
