The dark humor, the pace, the acting, the overall script is BAD, BAD, BAD.  I cant say enough.  This movie is not for animal lovers.  If you don't find humor in hanging a dog, throwing it off a roof, or even chopping it up for food....this movie is definitely NOT for you.",1289865600,3,398,4.116883116883117
4131366,2,B003JSSPRK,"This movie has no category to be rated. It is not a comedy, whatsoever. There is no suspense or not even a thrill. The plot is as described in the brief synopsis and there is nothing else I could add to persuade anyone to watch this painful movie. I have seen other Joon-ho Bong's movies and this one is the worst. I even took two days to resume the movie just to give the benefit of the doubt, but it miserably failed in every sense of the word. The only and just only good thing I can say about the movie is the OST is great. Other than that there is nothing else to add in favor of it.",1373846400,,588,3.9495798319327733
4131367,4,B003JSSPRK,"It's been a long time since I've written a review for Amazon, but I thought that this product deserves it. Disregarding the negative comments on the site that talk about the film, if you've already seen it and loved it- this is a great economic release. It's not often that Korean (or any Asian films, for that matter) come with Spanish subtitles, but this one does!

In short, it comes with subtitles in English and Spanish, as well as including an interview with Doona Bae, besides the trailer and highlights of the film.

The Latin American region (R4 on DVD, I think) for Asian releases is greatly under-explored. I've actually never heard of an Asian film being properly released on an R4 DVD unless it's Crouching Tiger, so there's a huge vacuum for Spanish-speaking Asian film lovers that wouldn't necessarily know how to speak English, so I had always wondered why some of the publishers aren't trying to fill in this void. So thank you, Mongrel Media for this release. Hope you acquire more Asian titles and expand on the subtitle options.

More publishers should do the same.",1369094400,2,1085,4.76063829787234
4131368,3,B003JSSPRK,"Flandersui Gae (A Dog of Flanders/Barking Dogs Never Bite) (Joon-ho Bong, 2000)

Joon-ho Bong has developed into one of Korea's most popular directors both at home and overseas, first with The Host, the highest-grossing Korean film of all time (viz. review 10Mar2008 ish), and then with Mother, one of the most critically-acclaimed Korean films of all time (viz. review 30Mar2011 ish). But he had a career, and a durned good one, long before coming up with either of those flicks; his second movie, Memories of Murder, is actually my favorite of his flicks (viz. review 1Apr2008 ish), and while it didn't really gain notoriety outside Korea until after he'd gotten big for his other movies, his debut feature, Flandersui Gae (known in English-speaking countries both as A Dog of Flanders and Barking Dogs Never Bite), was a pretty big hit back in the day. If you know Bong's later work, there's not going to be a good deal here that will surprise you--it's got that patented Bong mix of madcap mystery, uncomfortable humor, broad-spectrum ineptitude on the part of his endearing characters, and a sharp, witty script that brings it all together in a pleasurable way.

Plot: Yun-ju (Attack the Gas Station!'s Sun-jae Lee) is a college lecturer who's trying to achieve a professorship in a corrupt culture--it seems to be standard operating procedure for lecturers at his school who want to become professors to ""gift"" the dean with ten thousand bucks. Problem is, lecturers make peanuts, so where's he going to get that kind of money? As if that's not enough, somewhere in his large, faceless apartment block there's a yappy little dog who refuses to shut up. Yun-ju finds himself driven to extremes--once he has identified the beast, he kidnaps it. When he finds he can't bring himself to kill it, he locks it in a cabinet in the basement. When the missing-dog posters start going up, posted by both the dog's young owner and Hyeon-nam (Spring Bears Love's Doona Bae), an interested bookkeeper from the local tax office who had to give the posters an official stamp to make sure the cops didn't take them down, Yun-ju realizes he's got himself a case of mistaken identity--but when he goes to set the pooch free, it's gone...

And this kicks off a series of misadventures that has the movie careering wildly between missing-dog mystery (animal lovers beware, there are a few scenes you may find uncomfortable despite the large, prominently-displayed title card at the beginning stating that no animals were harmed during the making of the film), romantic comedy, and Richard Linklater-style slacker drama, with the odd action sequence here and there just to keep the viewer on his or her toes. Like Memories of Murder, the end result seems somewhat directionless, and that does seem a bit more of a problem here than it is in Memories of Murder. But not much more; this movie is still a great deal of fun, as well as being quite technically accomplished for it being the director's feature debut. If you're a Joon-ho Bong fan who's never gotten the chance to check this one out, it may not quite measure up to Bong's later efforts, but it's still a pretty good time. ***",1367712000,3,3170,4.834254143646409
4131369,3,B003JSSPRK,"3.5 star. This is definitely a dark comedy. You feel like a jerk for laughing, but laugh nonetheless ! This is a unique movie that keeps you entertained throughought . The characters are interesting and the actors do a great job.",1360800000,,229,4.609756097560975
4131370,5,B003JSSPRK,"Reviews for this movie are always so contrasting. You find five stars and one stars, but very little in between. After reading several reviews I've found that the five star reviews review the film and the one star reviews are written by those who find the film offensive. Why is it so offensive? Why are some people offended by the fictional killing of a dog, but not offended by the senseless slaughtering of humans in so many action/horror/etc. movies? And yet, those same people aren't offended by the killing of a snake, or any other ""ugly"" animal? What does that say about their moral priorities?

Anyway, The movie is great in just about every aspect. It is a very simple and mostly subtle film. The humor may be a bit too dark, or a bit too dry for some peoples tastes, but why be offended? The movie is satirical, as in, it makes fun of the not so glamorous aspects of Korean society (eating of dog meat, bribes to obtain position, etc.). Being offended by this movie makes about as much sense as being offended by Dr. Strangelove. If you liked Bong Joon-ho's other films, then I would recommend this wonderful, misunderstood film.

As for the quality of the DVD, it is perfectly good.",1346976000,3,1193,4.570093457943925

4131372,5,B003JSSPRK,"Good God, some people are just totally unable to see the forest for the trees! This film is a wonderful little gem from the early days of a director who is now internationally acclaimed as a brilliant young talent. I found it hilariously funny (albeit in a very dark way) -- yes, including the dog-dinner scenes -- as well as witty, quirky, warm, incisive, and ultimately moving in the way it shows the final redemption of the quasi-villain. As the timid dog-killer confesses his crimes to the heroic slacker, I could read the wonderful panorama of complex and conflicting emotions going through their minds on both their faces. I wanted to give them each a hug! In fact all of the actors were wonderful, including the supporting and minor characters (the crazy homeless man was a hoot, and the Amazonian best friend with the unexpected tender streak made me wish I had a pal like her to get my back). If you can't appreciate their excellent work because you cannot get over the dog scenes (even though they're staged anyway) or the 'offensive' satirical observations -- well, I guess you'd better just stay away from anything that's not warm and fuzzy and uplifting in the future (although the ending of this movie could well be called that, too, in its own offbeat way).  Oh, and by the way, all the people who found the dog scenes (again, staged) offensive and THEREFORE decided this movie is garbage (yes, I mean you), I hope you condemn any movie that features the killing of human beings (some even do so in the spirit of humor!) in even stronger terms... you do, right?",1308009600,10,1576,4.648745519713262
4131373,1,B003JSSPRK,"Maybe I just don't understand comedy. Or maybe Korean comedy is something Americans don't ""get"". Or maybe because I come from a culture where dogs are considered pets, I'm not laughing about dogs being killed and eaten for food. Or maybe I'm just as thick as a brick. But this was an awful movie and I would give it a zero rating if I could.
None of the characters are likable with the exception of the office worker. The passive aggressive professor who realizes he has to bribe his way into the job, the depressed domineering pregnant wife who is still supporting both of them, the janitor who dines on dog - nothing. The office worker's friend is okay, but not really somebody you would choose to be the heroine.
The want to be professor hates dogs. He suspects one of barking and getting on his nerves and he kidnaps the dog. He thinks about tossing it off a roof but doesn't. So he ends up locking the dog in a closet in the basement of his apartment complex. What a lovely guy. When he finds out that the dog he captured can't bark, he decides to get the dog back.  But it's too late. The janitor and one of his friends chop up and eat the dog.
SO he finds the dog that is barking. It's a little old lady's companion. He steals the dog and tosses it off a roof. The office worker sees him and tries to catch him (it's too late for the dog) but he gets away. She shows the dog's dead body to the little old lady. She has a heart attack and later dies.
So the professor's wife gets laid off. Not that the professor notices or seems to care. With part of her severance package, she buys a dog. She intends to use the rest of the money so her wonderful husband can make a bribe for a job. He's just the sort of person I'd want to teach somebody - if I was going to develop some sort of sociopath.
He takes the dog for a walk while the park is being sprayed with insecticide. Yeah, there are clouds and clouds of insecticide and somehow the dog disappears.
I'm with the wife on this event, I believe he purposely ""lost"" the dog. He searches for the dog because his wife tells him ""You're a dead man"" if he doesn't find the dog. He searches the basement and catches the janitor getting ready to make a meal. He fights with the janitor just to discover that the janitor has a whole chicken to cook this night, not a dog.
Then there's the homeless hobo (not sure exactly). he had managed to steal the janitor's dog soup before and he has captured the professor's dog. He decides that some puppy stew would be just the thing for him. Through some weird manipulations, the office worker happens to be on the roof of the apartment complex at the same time the doggy prep is going to happen. She manages to save the dog but she needs a little help from her friend.
The upshot? The professor confesses to the office worker. I don't know whether she doesn't believe him or is in shock. The professor gets his position. The office worker loses her job. The hobo gets arrested and the janitor dog napper is still able to prowl on dogs.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this. A man will do anything if he is pushed to his limits?  You can get away with murdering dogs? Trying to do a good deed is a waste of time because you lose your job? I did not see the comedy in this and would advise _no_ one to watch this movie. There is not one funny moment in it.",1304294400,2,3361,4.193199381761978
4131374,1,B003JSSPRK,"I didn't understand the point of this movie... unless it's meant to be an indictment of the Korean university system since the central character, a worthless, sociopathic loser, bribes his way into a professorship. There's only one likable character in the movie, a young woman who tries to do the right thing. Her only vice is wanting recognition, and her efforts to help people cause her to lose her job.

The whole thing plays like a student film. A bunch of odd characters and odd situations with a story that goes nowhere. Lots of detail and no insight. Very static and not at all funny.",1304208000,3,592,4.6380952380952385
4131375,5,B003JSSPRK,"Finally!  I've been waiting nine years for this movie to come out on US DVD, ever since I saw it at the first New York Korean Film Festival in 2001.  I knew it was just a matter of time, since director Bong has gotten a lot of international attention for his three subsequent features, ""Memories of Murder,"" ""The Host"" and ""Mother.""

Those are all terrific, but this this simultaneously depressing and exhilarating black comedy on the suburban rat race is still his best.  It's got all the stuff that makes Bong distinctive - his caustic cynicism about human nature and human institutions combined with an unfeigned compassion for humans as individuals; an affection for marginal, oddball types that doesn't tip into sentimental idealization; snappy visual wit full of imaginative framing and editing; a finely tuned ear for enormously funny but penetrating dialogue; a glee in booby-trapping the plot with surprises large and small; a daring but exquisitely right mix of contrasting tones - horror and humor, slapstick and melancholy.

The actors are all perfect, particularly the two iconic leads.  Handsome superstar Lee Sung-jae plays against type beautifully as a henpecked, career-stalled academic so spineless and full of repressed rage he seems about to curl into himself and vanish.  And this was my first glimpse of the enchanting Bae Doo-na, Korea's #1 actress for playing endearing misfits and no-hopers, something she's never done better than here.

I could go on and on - this is a little-acknowledged modern classic.  Whatever the hell ""modern classic"" means.

(But yeah, if you're supersqueamish about harm to cute, fluffy dogs, you might want to approach with caution - it's a major part of the story.  That said, there's a disclaimer at the beginning that no animals were harmed in the shoot, and there's nothing onscreen that makes me think otherwise - it's mostly offscreen suggestion.)",1294185600,15,1906,5.116129032258065

8398457,5,B003JSSPRK,"The Host is the most moving and funny and family-oriented horror movie I've ever seen. Just brilliant.

Barking Dogs is a tougher sell, since it involves a guy who can't stand a barking dog and does something about it. It's really about a man under too much pressure who responds badly, and when offered redemption and forgiveness kind of blows it. Very funny in spots.

""Mother"" is creative and engaging and very disturbing. Visually, maybe the most interesting of the three.

I assume that the terribly funny and terribly sad ""Memories of Murder"" is missing because of distribution rights or something.",1436659200,,604,4.96039603960396

8398461,5,B003JSSPRK,"Bong Joon Ho movie's have such simple premises that go to such bizarre lengths. Yet amazingly it's the characters that are so bizarre at the beginning, and at the end so simple. And being a animal lover myself, I was reticent going into this movie. And much like The Host, it's pretty shocking and graphic at first the lengths taken to rid this yappy dog. And the aftermath taken with the dogs corpse. But, much like A Fish Called Wanda, it starts to get comically insane. And sympathy for the characters start to outweigh the brutality and inhumane practices they exercise. For fans of Stanley Kubrick, and a shame he couldn't see Bong Joon Ho's works; I would say there's a lot of commonality between these two giants. Wonderfully shot, scripted, acted, and scored, and with moments that will linger for a lifetime with the viewer.
