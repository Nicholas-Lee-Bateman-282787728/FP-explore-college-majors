3971742,5,B002R8Q1RE,"I am very pleased with the production and setlist of the Live in manila dvd. The camera work, lighting, and stage design is very appealing. The setlist covers a good portion of their hits spanning from 1978-2009, with over 20 songs. You definetly get your money's worth with this product and you will not be dissapointed.

The only complaint I have is the sound is not as good as it should be. Its hard at time to hear the crowd and the backing vocals from the band.

By far this is the best post Steve Perry Journey dvd out there.",1255996800,,531,4.3

3971745,4,B002R8Q1RE,"I would love to give this DVD a 5-star rating based on the sound quality and the concert.  But something isn't right.  At first it appears the video is washed out - in a haze.  OK so there are fog machines on stage and the picture quality takes a hit.  But even at it's best, the colors are blah and nothing is really in focus.  Did they makes this from a VHS transfer or just use lower quality cameras?
  It's standard DVD format so I was not expecting blu-ray sharpness and color definition.  But usually, standard definition video close-ups are sharp even when the audience and wide shots are fuzzy.  The video is consistent regardless of scene.  I'm guessing they shot this video with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen) and then cropped it into a widescreen video.  Maybe it looks OK on TV, but on a projector screen it reminds me of videos from the early 90's.
  In any case it's great to hear the music of Journey again.
What a high energy performance!",1255651200,,957,4.431034482758621
3971746,5,B002R8Q1RE,"Price exclusive to Walmart is very cheap considering it is a 2 DVD concert video. Concert videos are usually more expensive than movies. I know it because I collect concert videos.

  Video is excellent as well as the audio on 5.1 Dolby digital. Buy now and if the Blu ray version comes out, just give this DVD to a friend. Why torment yourself when you can have it now and it is very cheap.",1255478400,,391,4.256756756756757
3971747,4,B002R8Q1RE,"As a longtime Journey fan, I think ""Live From Manila"" holds its own against any other live Journey performance.  The band continues to sound great, the playing is top notch all around, and I think Pineda embodies what the rest of the band wants and needs in a front man.  He's energetic and lively, plus playing in front of his hometown probably amped him up a few more levels for this performance.  My only knock against the package is that there's no backstage/interview type of feature.  Especially considering Pineda has been in the band about 2 years now, I'd thought this would have been the perfect opportunity to get some one-on-one face time with him.  But still, it's 2 hours and 25 minutes, and it's $10 at Walmart.  That's just simply an unbeatable deal.  (And I realize some people outside the US may not have easy access to a Walmart location, in which case I would say, $20 would not be too much to pay for this package.  Any more than that............ you're on your own.) If you're in the US, there's no good reason to be buying this package from online sellers here at Amazon or anywhere else.  All the hits are here, as well as a few deeper cuts from the late 70s and early 80s.  (As always, one of my favorites ""Girl Can't Help It"" is not included, but that's happened so many times, I can't/don't hold that against them.)

And finally, this last part is just a rant.  Feel free to skip it if you'd like.  Arnel Pineda is a great singer, and he covers Steve Perry's voice nearly flawlessly.  Despite what some angry, bitter people type on places like this, yes, THIS IS JOURNEY.  Just because the band doesn't have the same lead singer anymore, it's still Journey.  (And for the record, Perry was Journey's 3rd or 4th lead singer, depending on whether or not you count Fleischman).  People usually decide what ""their"" version of a band is based upon what they grew up hearing, and anything that isn't that exact same version is ""fake"".  That's simply not correct.  This DVD (along with their album ""Revelation"") is Journey since 2007.  You can feel free to not like this version of the band, but yes, it's Journey, whether you like it or not.  Plus, these people don't even listen to the music.  They just want to complain.  (For a good example, read some reviews for Foreigner's new album ""Can't Slow Down"" or Skynyrd's new album ""God & Guns"").

As far as this DVD goes, the newer songs are good, and the classic songs sound true to the way you remember them.  Congrats Journey on another great offering!",1255305600,27,2525,4.545454545454546
3971748,5,B002R8Q1RE,"I will not discuss the price of the DVD as part of this review, since the DVD is a Walmart exclusive and the only way to get it for the tagged price is if you go direct to merchant.

With this DVD, Journey marks the  first time it tops the Billboard's Top Music Video Sales chart.  Their 2005 release Live In Houston 1981 - The Escape Tour peaked at number nine.  Also, Live In Manila has the second best DVD debut sales week of 2009, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

This concert was indeed shot at 4K resolution, but you are not getting that kind of resolution except nothing different from the regular DVD quality movies you have in your home.  The quality is actually limited by the DVD format.

The concert was made by the team from ""Wizard"", who brought with them an army of ""Red Cameras"". They shot at 4K, beyond high definition of display resolution.  Even Blu-ray cannot touch the hi-res of a 4K. OK, it is a DVD, and for now it does not mean anything.  But somehow, it is nice to know that maybe, hopefully, sometime in the future, there will be a chance to see it in its full lifelike resolution.

The first thing that will catch your eyes is the nice art work.  Classic 80's, psychedelic, LSD inspired :), both inside and outside, a magnificent showcase of album art.  It is a nostalgic trip back to one of the golden eras of music. It includes an 8-page brief retelling of the succession of events that lead to this historical concert.  Journey stayed for 2 weeks in the Philippines.  Their new lead singer brought them to see his humble beginnings; his old neighborhood, his old school where he was forced to drop out for lack of money. Homeless at the age of 13, he brought them to the park where he used to sleep at night, often in an empty stomach.

No doubt, this live performance (March 14, 2009, in front of close to 30,000 fans) is one important piece of history for the band. As we know, the band had their ups and downs, the break up, the succession of singers, and even a scandal.  Journey is one of the monster melodic rock bands in the history of rock & roll.  80 million records under their belt, including their last album, ""Revelation"", which is now a cinch to become double platinum.  The ""Journey: Live in Manila"" debuted at the Oprah Winfrey Show, which made a lot of people searched the internet to find out who the hell is Arnel Pineda.  That special appearance propelled Arnel Pineda's name to #8 in Yahoo's top ten searches the next day.

The concert is very special to Arnel.  2 years ago, he was virtually unknown. Then Schon's discovery on YouTube, and then everything happened so fast that even Arnel admitted that all the blessings that he has received has not sunk in yet.  A story that reminds you about the movie Rockstar, but this time it is happening in real life.

24 songs, the 2-DVD package is a 2 hours and 25 minutes of classic Journey hits including 7 songs from their last album.  You can really feel Arnel's emotion and happiness performing in front of his fellow countrymen.  He is bouncing around, jumping, covering every inch of the stage.  Guitar god Neal Schon never fails to amaze the audience which is why he is one of the greatest living guitarist of our time.  At the same time, he is showering the front stage with his signatured picks as fast as a ninja throw his stars.  Jonathan Cain and his multiple level of keyboards still hammers those keys like he used to in the MTV version of ""Separate Ways"".  Ross Valory always is the band's clown, making as many faces as Jim Carey can in his ""Dumb and Dumber"" days.  And lastly, Dean Castronovo (who used to play with Black Sabbath) provided well appreciated respite for Arnel by belting out ""Kepp on Runnin'"", ""Mother Father"" and ""Still They Ride"".  An incredible singer/drummer combination.",1254960000,75,3803,4.508029197080292
3971749,5,B002R8Q1RE,"I agree with the other reviewer that all new DVD releases should offer a Blu Ray version because Blu Ray would offer both enhanced sound and picture quality.

The concert in Manila was very special because it was the hometown for Journey's new lead singer, Arnel Pineda. Arnel and his bandmates did not disappoint the fans. Arnel has a great voice and sings with a lot of heart. This DVD provides a great selection of Journey's hits and also quite a few of their new songs.

I happened to hear/see one song this new Steve Perry sound alike sung in Manila on TV and I saw how amazingly hard he worked and how amazingly serious he was about doing a great job in concert and I couldn't help but be amazed. I love both Steve's now and don't feel like the new one is an imposter anymore. He's a good guy and man he's full of energy. Love them both now.

The main surprise for many must be the fact that this is the awaited performance of the band with its new frontman Arnel Pineda and in front of an audience of his countrymen since he was born In Phillipines. Well, what a debut, this guy sings incredibly. Comparisons are always unfair and hard but let's say that if you like me loved all this classic songs but tended to get tired of the excessive vocal approach of Steve Perry (live in Houston 1981), this will be no problem here, this little guy reaches the high keys but understands perfectly when to sing and when to remain silent. The classic tunes are sung and played with all detail and the new ones are great songs too. My fear of the absence of some classics (covered on 2001 DVD) for example 'Who's crying now' or 'Send her my love' vanished the moment I freed myself from any preconceptions and sat down to enjoy this show. Please note the extremely great performance of singing drummer Deen Castronvo. I mean OK, one thing is doing great backing vocals but another is singing lead vocals in the perfect key while playing drums all along the song. Mother, Father was an example of this. The rest of the band as usual, impeccable and having great fun. J. Cain playing some classical arrangement (from his own album I guess) and Neil Schon as usual in charge of the rougher edge with his playing.
Make no mistake this is not a band shooting their last bullets, it seems more like a new breath of fresh air and Mr. Pineda has a lot of credit on all this. A true classic american rock band.",1433721600,4,1561,4.442508710801394

3971775,3,B002R8Q1RE,"I bought this when I found it for under $20.  I own the DVD version as well.  I picked this up hoping that because of the RED technology and the DTS MA lossless sound mix it would be an improvement over the DVD.  Visually it is better than the DVD but only in some respects.  Other reviews have mentioned that there is color over-saturation especially in the magenta/reds.  The clarity while better than the DVD was not  overly impressive.  The clarity on Peter Gabriel's Back to Front and the Police's Certifiable Blu-Ray releases look better to me and I don't believe they're done with the RED technology (perhaps that explains the over-saturation in the reds though???)

As for the audio, many reviews have said that the mix is poor and I have to agree.  Overall the high end is too bright. There is very little low bass, drums and bass guitar are anemic. The vocals on many songs are too low and pushed back; Jonathan Cain's keys are lost.  Neil Schon's guitar is overly prominent throughout.  Others have suggested using the Lossy 2.0 track to tame the audio and this does help a little but I bought a surround disc and would prefer to hear the concert in decent surround as opposed to the soupy mess found with both the DTS MA and the Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks.  I realize this was done outside but so was the Police Certifiable and the mix of the Police concert is much better.

The performance is high energy as might be expected since Arnel is the 'prodigal son'.  I would have preferred it if they slowed down most of the songs, they all are performed up-tempo and to me, they are all done too fast.  I love Journey and they've done what they could to keep the faith in the absence of Steve Perry.  They just need to do another concert and have it mixed by the folks that did the Police Certifiable or The Eagles Farewell Tour 1 Live in Melbourne (which I personally think is one of the best concert blu-rays both in the audio and video areas.)  Anyway, this release leaves me wanting much more.  Hopefully another much better mixed concert will be put out by Journey.

3971784,4,B002R8Q1RE,"First, let me say that the song choices and performance were very good. The new lead singer, Arnel Pineda was every bit as good as Steve Perry. (all nostalgia put aside). I subtract from the ""Movie"" score since I believe an indoor performance would have been a much better choice when recording a performance such as this. Outdoor performances are so problematic and can't compare with the result of producing and recording indoors. The audio would have been much better had they recorded indoors.

 There are a few technical issues with the Video and Audio.

  Video

  Resolution, color and sharpness very good, but reds and magenta colors were oversaturated. Whether it is over-saturated enough to be distracting is a matter of personal taste. The lead vocalist's red-colored jeans looked like they were on fire most of the time.(lol)
  Camera angles and editing were not manic and felt appropriate.

  Audio

  The Lossless DTS Master Audio was a high-frequency screechy mess! I do realize that mid-range and bass are lost in the mix somewhat when performing outdoors, but all I could hear was an ear-fatiguing soup of lead guitar and voice....no bass drum/bass guitar and no piano.
  There are 2 other lossy audio choices...Dolby Digital and LPCM 2.0

 After much trial and error, I found the LPCM 2.0 superior to the other audio codecs. The LPCM took away the high-end screech and put everything back into balance. The bass drum/bass guitar had more presence as well. I did, however still have to increase my subwoofer volume about 20% over my normal settings.
 My advice is to select LPCM 2.0 on the Blu-Ray menu and then use a lossy codec on your receiver to give the sound a little wider soundstage. I found that a lossy DTS Music or DTS Neo listening field worked best. A Multi-channel stereo might work just as well for you - depending on your set-up.

  I do realize that this is the only opportunity to get Journey on Hi-Def, but I rate the experience a 3.75 out of 5 overall.

3971806,5,B002R8Q1RE,"Gave this DVD as a birthday present surprise to my girlfriend.  Since we are both children of the 80's and remember JOURNEY at the height of their popularity, we were skeptical about how good they would sound all these years later and . . . with a new lead singer!!  However, my girlfriend texted and called me multiple times that day while I was as work just to tell me just how amazing it was!!

The picture and the sound are both fantastic and Arnel Pineda is a more than worthy replacement for one of the all time great voices in rock n roll Steve Perry!!  Neil Shone is still at the top of his game and it is cool just to see the old guys up there having a ball and kicking some butt!!

Could not be happier with this buy!!  Recommend it to anyone who is a JOURNEY or classic rock fan!!  You won't believe how many times youll say, I LOVE this song!! and catch yourself slapping on the old air guitar!!  Simply a great time!!",1374883200,6,930,4.156424581005586

3971825,3,B002R8Q1RE,"If you read the reviews here you'll see polarizing thoughts on this one--for a reason. When I first read them I thought how could they possibly screw up this concert Blu-Ray with the high-tech video system and typically great Journey concert sound? Well...if you have a good system, they managed to do just that!

First, the touted ""Red"" system is just that--too RED--along with overblown contrast which makes for DVD-like picture (the 1080i should have been a red flag). Next, the all-important sound even if DTS-MA is just blah...it's loud but has no dynamics and its shrilled and compressed and just grates after no time at all. Yes, I'm talking about the Blu-Ray version! A hard-rock producer mixed this concert which was held in a converted parking lot in the Philippines and it sounds like it.

Bottom line unless you are a real fan and want to see the new singer strut his stuff with inferior production, stay clear of this.  This can't hold a candle to the Jeff Beck discs, A-ha's swan song gem, or Within Temptation's amazing performance disc.  VERY disappointed.",1333238400,4,1072,4.841530054644808

I wish Amazon could speed up their delivery, which averages about 4 weeks. And re price - why does Amazon have it advertised at a bloated $45.99?
To the DVD itself - the much hyped Oakley Red Camera is nothing but window dressing - PQ was average, no sharp colours at all, a tad above standard DVD quality. But the biggest disappointment was the AQ, Arnel Pineda sounded muted, and the lead guitarist sounded strident - to a point where the ear's began to pain. The drummer who seemed to put so much effort, poor fellow, little did he realise that he would turn up on BR with his contributions relegated into the background.

Unfortunately, all audio options suffer from the same problem. The center channel vocals take a back seat to the left and right main speakers in this mix.  New lead singer's vocals are rather muted and overpowered by the rest of the channels.

Perhaps I expected more, but when compared to say the Eagles and the David Gilmour discs, the poor mix really shows. I put on various other concerts in to ensure my system was not causing the problem.  In fact, the above mentioned concerts sounded as great as always.

I read that this Blu-ray was an improvement in audio and video quality.  It is a major improvement over the DVD but the percussion seems muffled and muddy and the lead guitar is featured a little too much in compared to balance with the rest of the instrument mix.  It is not as good as some Blu-ray audio quality I own but Blu-ray does not always guarantee an improved product that is worth the expense.

The video quality is very good on this Blu Ray and I would rate a 4 out of 5. The Audio quality is very good with the best sound offered via DTS HD Audio. The sound itself is a bit heavy on the right sound track in the first segment of this concert. It is much more eneloping about 1/2 way into the concert and remains that way throughout the balance of the show to the point that you feel as though you are part of the concert. Other formats include PCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 although they are not as strong as the DTS. This HD Video is in the Widescreen 1:78:1 format which fills the entire screen of HDTV's.

Classic Journey songs include: Faithfully, Don't Stop Believn', Any way you want it, Wheel in the sky and Open Arms to name but a few from this nearly 2.5 hour show.

But holy smoke, his guitar is WAY TOO up front in the mix. As for me, the Drummer is the most important musician in a band, and unfortunately Deem's drums are not mixed correctly to reveal that he's a virtuoso, but you can only tell by watching him perform, because his cymbal work can't be heard clearly. And his full stroke snare shots explode when you can hear them. He's a great singer too. But Cain's keyboard work is buried, Ross' Bass is there, but barely and the GREAT on pitch vocals are overwhelmed by the guitar 1/2 the time. Frankly, it doesn't sound like the 'whole band' is there.

I just watch this concert in blu ray and it was Excellent. Video quality was ultra sharp. Why? filming of this concert was done utilizing the 4k High Definition camera by Oakley called RED and will be the future industry standard(research and you'll know Ultra High Definition). My impressions on the concert: variety of camera movement like panning, zooming, and overall focus variety on stage/band members/audience coverage was done professionally. Audio is just the best. Song selections are plenty from the classic hits to the latest album Revelations (26 total). Minor gripes I can say is that no bonus materials and very expensive for a blu ray. However, as an avid Journey and Arnel Pineda fan, I can't help but swallow the pride of ownership as this blu ray can't be found anywhere else so far but amazon. I've been collecting many concert blu rays already and this is one of the best.

This seems like nothing new as I saw Journey live in the 80's and walked away with the same impression and disappointment in the mix. Don't get me wrong: I love rock guitar and play guitar myself. However, there is something to be said for a balanced mix where the other band members can shine too. Journey's recordings always had great vocal harmonies and they are lost in this mix. When Schon stops playing for a moment, you can hear a glimpse of the melodies and harmonies. Then he comes back in and completely drowns everything, but hey you can hear every palm thunk, string slide, and bum note out of his guitar! Woohoo!",1278028800,3,758,4.580882352941177
3971850,4,B002R8Q1RE,"First of all, to like this DVD, you have to like Journey, with their pop-rock brand of music.  If so, I think you'll generally enjoy this, though the DVD isn't quite perfect.  For example, Neal Schon and Deen Castronovo give enthusiastic performances, with Castronovo turning out to be a surprisingly good singer, but the sound quality of the guitar and drums is a bit muddy.  On the other hand, the sound quality for Jonathan Cain and Ross Valory is fine, but their stage presence strikes me as a bit dull.

But the high point of the whole performance, and clearly the new soul of the band, is Arnel Pineda.  No, his voice doesn't quite have the unparalleled richness and layered complexity of Steve Perry's voice, but Pineda is still exceptionally good and I think he does capture Perry's essence.  And of course Pineda's rags to riches story is heartwarming and inspiring, so the fact that this performance is in his hometown of Manila adds unique magic.  Kudos to Pineda, and kudos also to Journey for being open-minded and generous enough to give him this opportunity.  It works out to be a win-win outcome.  Or, rather, win-win-win, since we the audience also benefit from this little musical renaissance.

Highly recommended, particularly to Journey fans.",1275868800,2,1262,4.882629107981221
3971851,2,B002R8Q1RE,"I just viewed the concert on the HD concert channel, ""Palladia"". I have read all of the reviews of the poor video quality but it was crisp and clear on Palladia.
My complaint is it sounds like Neil Schon did the final audio mix and mastering. I tried listening in 5.1, stereo and other settings with the same results. Schon's guitar dominates the mix way way way too much especially on the right channel. The drums are lost and muddy and the keys are almost nonexistant. ""Seperate Ways"" is a keyboard driven song and I couldn't even hear them over the guitar.
The new singer sings great but even his vocals are overshadowed by the guitar and like another review said the backup vocals were weak.
I was wondering if others noticed this on their DVD copies of the concert before I make the decision to buy or pass???",1275091200,17,814,4.469798657718121

3971855,5,B002R8Q1RE,i own other concert dvd's by journey and by far this is the best one yet. to shot it in arnel's hometown was a great idea. i also wish that they had bonus features. arnel gives steve perry a run for the money on his engery level. for those  who think that is not journey without steve perry they need to listen to arnel and realize that arnel is better than steve.,1263686400,2,364,4.055555555555555
3971856,4,B002R8Q1RE,"Let's get the qualifications out of the way first.  I've been a Journey fan since 1977 or so, and have seen them live nearly a dozen times on the Evolution, Departure, ROR and post-Perry tours.  I'm also a professional musician.  Therefore, I can sum up this DVD with the following sentence.

SOMEBODY WAKE UP JONATHAN CAIN.

I had very high hopes for this disc, but any enjoyment I might've gotten out of it is severely dampened by the fact that Cain acts like he would rather be getting a root canal than performing for thirty thousand people.  I've been onstage for crowds one third that size, and I have to say it's pretty invigorating.  Maybe he just doesn't like Pineda.  Maybe he wanted to be the lead singer.  Who knows.  But, jeez Louise, I swear the guy looks bored out of his mind.  Don't agree?  Watch it again.

Apart from the sleepwalking Mr. Cain, the show is great.  Deen chimes in with a few tunes and does a spectacular job; he is so good that, when I saw the band with Augeri in Colorado Springs and they launched into 'Patiently,' I and about half the crowd thought that the band had reconciled with Perry for an Anniversary show or something.

I don't know what Jonathan's problem is, but I certainly hope he doesn't become a weight around the band as they try to rightfully enjoy the success they've been denied for a dozen years or more.",1257552000,2,1360,4.471544715447155
3971857,1,B002R8Q1RE,"I just received my dvd Joureny - Live in Manila and was greatly disappointed.  It was grainy....lacking detail...camera angles varied from ok to too dark, and the worse part was that the audio was not in synch with video at many points.  All of my audio equipment is in excellent condition.  I am a BIG Journey fan and I love them but I can't understand if they made a mistake in releasing this inferior quality dvd or is it only my dvd copy. (??)  There is NO comparison to the dvd copy in Revelations album last year live in Las Vegas.  Revelations is much better produced...clear as a bell..detail amazing...sound fabulous.  I am at a loss.  To make this more intriguing I see that Walmart, the only retail outlet licensed to sell ""Live in Manila"", has pulled it off their mail order list after only 1 week.  I can't easily get to a Walmart as there are none in NYC, to check their shelves for a copy.  Why if the DVD debuted at ""#1 live dvd"" Oct 15 would Walmart pull it off their mailing order list after only 1 week.  They made a small fortune on Revelations.  Do they know something we don't...or maybe we do know now.  Can anyone shed some light on this?  I can tolerate a lot when it comes to Journey but this dvd quality stinks!",1257379200,5,1238,4.307359307359308
3971858,5,B002R8Q1RE,"Not only is Arnel Pineda a great addition to the band, this DVD proves his superior showmanship.  Despite performing for over 2 and a half hours in blistering humididty (Neal Schon claimed his guitar strings felt rusty by the 3rd song) the band, and Arnel in particular show such unbridled joy on stage, that its contageous.  You can tell they love playing this music, so you love watching and listening to it.  To those who doubt Arnel's voice, he is just as good, if not better than Steve Perry.",1257206400,2,497,4.561797752808989
3971859,5,B002R8Q1RE,"More than half of the songs are arranged differently or say extended wonderfully. They should come out with a CD release so we can listen to it in the car. Neal Schon, the greatest rock and roll warrior is a delight to watch. Guitar god material every minute. I wanted to hear Arnel Pineda sing some of Steve Augeri's material but they did not include any or even a duet with Jonathan Cain on one of those Perry and Rolie songs. I definitely also wanted to hear ""The Girl Can't Help It"" but it's not included. Production is very slick and also the camera angles. Has more than 20 songs on it. Definitely a must buy if you're and old fan and a new fan. The new arrangements are what has got me giving 5 stars. It is nice to see veteran bands try not to be boring specially when some audience had been in their shows mltiple times. A musicians delight indeed.",1256688000,,857,4.263803680981595
3971860,5,B002R8Q1RE,"What more can i say........but MAGNIFICENT.
Arnel and the old troop have done it again , they have produced an excellent live dvd (blue ray or not) at a very affordable price.
The quality of the content and packaging is excellent and surely should propell Journey into the top flight of rock/aor again.
You cant forget the past , Steve Perry inparticular , who with the help of J Cain wrote so much of their best material .
Steve was Journey and will always be the voice (do us all a favour and release some new material before your gone) , blending blues/rock and soul in such a magical way BUT Arnel Pineda now complements Mr Schon , Costranovo , Valory and Cain as being the sound of today.
The song selection is excellent and embodies so much of what Journey stand for...supreme aor.
You cant please some people , isn't over 2 hours of musical magic enough.
After Revelation and now Live in Manila i cant wait for the next.
Please don't leave it too long.
The only thing i have against the dvd is that it has only been released in the US.
I am a UK fan and only managed to get hold of a copy (as with the 3 disc Revelation release ) via my cousin the US , who kindly sent me copies.
There is a massive fan base in the UK....so buck up Journey/Walmart enterprises.
The only thing left open is to say buy it now and put Journey in their rightful place...at the top.",1256515200,,1367,4.241379310344827
