4208196,5,B003V8BE12,"Simply Amazing Documentary of a family dealing with generations of mental illness issues. This is a must see for any professional- teacher, therapist, clinician- working with individuals and families affected by this disease. Tom Murray pulls off a miracle by exposing the dynamics that overcame such debilitating prospects for his younger brother, Chris, through the honest and open perspective of his Mom, his siblings, and himself. Extremely enjoyable- watch this just to see who the greatest artist in the world really is! Janice Murray deserves an Oscar for the greatest Mom of all time.",1280016000,12,592,5.308510638297872
4208197,5,B003V8BE12,"I am 50 years old. I have a 14 year son with autism and I just recently lost my father to cancer. My father had a terrible temper and most likey had undiagnosed  Asperger's Syndrome. This movie spoke to me so deeply I cannot even express it in words. The images in the old home movies are riveting. The narration, done by the film maker, is poignant and heartfelt, but the true star of this film is Chris Murray, the amazingly brilliant artist who happens to be autistic. He has known who he is since birth, and those of us fortunate to love an autistic person spend our lives learning from them about humankind. This is also a story of a mother's fearless love and refusal to write her son off. What a fascinating, intricately woven story of a complicated family history. I had to stop the movie several times the first time I saw it in order to cry. POWERFUL. Thank you, Tom Murray, for helping me understand and work through so many strong emotions.",1278806400,52,952,4.409090909090909
4208198,5,B003V8BE12,"This is an incredibly moving story, well documented with video archives, of a family dealing with the supposed mental illness (bi-polar) of Dad, and the complicated birth and resulting diagnosis of autism in youngest brother Chris. The narrator is brother Tom who has lovingly shared with the audience the family's rise and fall from affluence, the daily challenges of life and the resulting triumph. This film will touch your heart, mind and soul and change the way you view people's differences more than reading hundreds or books or taking Psychology classes. It is such an intimate film you might feel a bit guilty watching at times. Tom Murray is an excellent filmmaker and his film has the power to enlighten those who watch.",1278806400,4,731,4.951219512195122
4208199,5,B003V8BE12,"This is one great movie.  Filmed by Chris' brother, Tom Murray, it's the story of an autistic man.  At first very sad, but what a wonderful twist that will bring a tear to your eye, guaranteed.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but it will make your spirit soar, and make you realize that labels are only labels and not representative of what a ""disabled"" person can accomplish.  I felt like I did when the Sixth Sense ended, and duh, I didn't realize Bruce Willis was ...well, you know.  This great movie is worthy to be seen by all, and I think should be nominated for an academy award.",1278720000,2,589,4.318181818181818

4208214,5,B003V8BE12,Was drawn into this performance due to my empathy for those suffering from autism. Interesting how it was dealt with in the 60's and 70's when Chris was growing up.  Inspirational to see his mother persevere to allow Chris to reach independent living in spite of his difficulties.

4208220,5,B003V8BE12,Just sort of awesome!,1444089600,,21,4.5
4208221,4,B003V8BE12,"This was very well made. I had thought it would be 90 minutes of interviews with and information about the young man with autism but it's fair to say that more than 50% of the movie was about the young man's father's childhood, upbringing, and emotional instabilities which contributed to the way he treated his autistic son. Because I'm a fan of family histories I enjoyed it all the way through, but in all fairness I would say that this film isn't so much about being autistic or having an autistic family member as it is about ""The Murray Family"" so to speak. Which was very interesting as it was. If someone wanted to cut this down to just ""the autistic content"" they could probably cut it down to 30-40 minutes worth of material but they'd miss out on a big part of the family dynamics and take away the heart of the film (not to mention the beautifully done family films and photos which date back to the 1920s in many instances and which provide a fascinating glimpse of the lives of the well-to-do New Yorkers back in the day). I really have nothing negative to say about this movie, despite the fact that I watched it in hopes of getting to see 90 minutes of documentary-style interviews with an autistic young man in order to get a glimpse into his mindset and daily life (which is not what this film turned out to be, and I'm glad; I believe I enjoyed this more in the long run than I would have, had that been the case). Bottom line - watching this will never be a waste of time for anyone, but a trigger warning might be worthwhile for those who have difficulty with stories about alcoholic and/or emotionally troubled fathers. This film portrays autism in a positive light overall and I love that there was no trivialization, but likewise no demonization.",1443398400,,1770,4.4829721362229105

4208229,5,B003V8BE12,"I'm so impressed with this family story, but especially by Christopher Murray himself. During childbirth he was apparently deprived of oxygen and, as a result, has special needs. But what he actually has is a lack of constraints -- so what comes from him is from a pure and simple place. I think he seems better able to love, enjoy a simple life and to create art because of this lack of constraints. It's a lovely film, made possible because the family had so many home movies. The film tells the family story with refreshing candor -- blemishes and all,  but with love. I almost thought the film became a little slow in the middle, but it all fit together in the end.",1434758400,,669,4.439024390243903

4208232,5,B003V8BE12,"YES it's not a downer if you are in a similar situation--Before initially viewing this film  I wrote a note to the filmmakers and said look, my sons Adult age, about to be done with school. My worst fear  was now coming to life-School gave him a place to Be,belonging. Safe, provided socialization, stimulation, and activities-a purpose. Over. Why did we all work so hard with him those years if it ended at 22? Vocational skills were learned, but he needed support enough there was no place to practice them!! Now we had to  find a life for him w/little support, programs/available-suddenly he had NO place/very limited- and I thank God and those that provide them.(He is not as functional as some nor as the 'Star' of this film, I point out). Your brother has LONG been in that time period--I said, will you promise this won't depress me?' they reassured me, and said God had a plan for my son. SO, just to say i did find it encouraging, educational-tips with my son, saw God working in a family & felt a little encouragement in my Mom work. (thanks to their amazing Mom) And saw that family Illnesses interconnect sometimes with these issues.",1434067200,,1145,4.602941176470588

The boy in this film ends up being a famous artist, rich, the happiest of his siblings, and the most normal child in the family as a grown adult. The point of the documentary is to show that special needs kids are more normal than normal adults and often they become the keepers of the family and of the love. The ""normal kids"" end up being the ones with problems, broke, divorced, unhappy, on drugs, etc. Its important to realize too that these autistic kids are often much more loving than normal kids and in this child's case, more successful.

This is not a depressing piece, but an incredibly moving and uplifting story of a family that suffered not one, but two tragedies - a son whose difficult birth caused lifelong mental disabilities, and a father who succumbed to mental illness.  The fact that the family was one of great wealth and former prestige slipped away was a third tragedy upon which the film maker, brother of the protagonist, chose not to dwell upon in great depth.  The central character, Chris Murray, displayed an awesome strength of character which no doubt was the product of his mother's undying love and commitment and his family's acceptance, encouragement and love.  The love between brothers was most touching, and the use of childhood movies and pictures displayed both the passing of time and the depth of love between the boys and their parents.  We could only wish that all those limited in cognitive and social skills could be surrounded by such acceptance and support.  Chris Murray's art is absolutely amazing!

4208265,5,B003V8BE12,"What a great/honest movie. Unfortunately for weeks, the movie sat in my ""Queue"". I was under the impression that it might have been more ""Political""---a family struggling against Congress/Government/etc. for recognition.
(Nixon-of course used a the Archetype of a not very ""warm"" person).

Could not have been more wrong. Movie has *NOTHING* to do with ""Politics"". The name simply comes from a very brief (but telling/kindly moment). Once you see it in the movie it ""all makes sense"", however until then.....

It's difficult to review this without giving out Spoilers/Plot twists as to why this is an important movie and should be watched by everyone.

The only critique (and feel it's worth mentioning to those who have not watched it). A point in the movie, goes completely off topic, it almost feels like a ""wait a second moment""--feeling the story abandoned itself to tell a different story. *HANG TIGHT*--it ""comes back around"". The ""Professional Critics"" blast about this. (never cared to read those until *AFTER* watching it. It does feel ""odd"" while watching. You'll leave knowing it ""made sense"", yet incomplete.

Best way I can equate. You've had a nice meal with large family outing. Order desert. You excuse yourself to make a 3-minute cell phone call. Only to come back to the table, see it wiped clean, preparing for the next party. YOu turn/ see your group waiting at the front door for their cars to be delivered by the Valet.

Thus my analogy, feel very gracious for the nice meal/time spent with family/friends. Yet feel ""cheated"" because you didn't finish desert. (example-you'd never ""speak up""--for fear of acting sour/labeled as such. However, for X-Minutes feel kinda ""miffed"" didn't get your desert.

QUOTE:
Normally, when you reach the end of a documentary and say to yourself, ""I'm not sure which character that film was about,"" it's a bad thing, a sign of unclear writing and poor execution. But in the case of ""Dad's in Heaven With Nixon,"" Tuesday night on Showtime, it's a testament to how rich this bittersweet tale is.

This is one of the the BEST documentaries I have ever seen. I loved the people in it so much, that I didn't want it to end. When it was over, I wanted to watch it again - right away.

GUARANTEED GREAT! SEE IT!!!",1353369600,,390,4.118421052631579
4208274,5,B003V8BE12,"moving documentary.  The description pulled me in as it mentioned autism, but it is more about the trauma a father perpetrates against a son and how that is passed down.",1351382400,,169,4.633333333333334
4208275,5,B003V8BE12,"This wonderful and moving documentary deals with the family background and show snippets of the life of an autistic individual who is remarkable for his child-like enthusiasm, honesty, lack of guile, talent, and goodness of heart. His optimism is infectious, and his broad, un-selfconscious grin is a joy to behold. I watched this film twice on Netflix, and was moved to tears several times on both occasions. The brother narrates the movie with precision, affection and a lack of condescension that is remarkable and unique for this kind of material. This film is a must-see, if only to witness first-hand what an amazing human being the main character is.",1318291200,,657,5.036697247706422
4208276,5,B003V8BE12,"This documentary is fascinating.  The scenes of the family over the decades will draw you in, and the story of how Chris overcame his overwhelming difficulties to speak, live independently, and create really important art is nothing short of miraculous.

At times, I felt that Chris was not so much limited as severely misunderstood.  At the end, when he is asked what artist in the world he would most like to see in a museum, he's slow to answer, and reflective.  After all, he has worked hard on his own pieces and knows how they look already, but this is a concept that may be difficult and time-consuming to convey, so he finally relents and gives the expected answer:  himself.  There are several little vignettes like this throughout the film where it seems as if people are being patient with his limitations when, actually, it may be Chris who has resigned himself to be agreeable (downright saintly, in fact) and just go with the flow.  The understated but dead-on impression of Nixon saying, ""Good, Chris!"" betrays extreme wit, and some of his meanderings during conversation are not really so far off the mark as they are relevant when you take the time to think about it.  Chris is unconventional, but he isn't at all stupid.

The family deserves so much credit for their support of each other.  This is really an American love story.",1314576000,,1347,4.717948717948718
4208277,5,B003V8BE12,"This film wove together the threads of family history, autism, and art, in an endearing and touching documentary, which (unlike some family chronicles) is pithy and well-edited. The central character, who is autistic but enjoys his menial job and also creates amazing artwork, is a truly inspiring individual on so many levels. His sweetness, his work ethic, and his blazing talent, as well as the quirks in his thinking that spring from being autistic, combine to make one of the most endearing film subjects imaginable. I have no particular connection to autism, but this film is certainly a must-see for anyone whose life has been touched by it.",1309219200,,648,5.0092592592592595
4208278,5,B003V8BE12,"This documentary is incredibly written. The threading together of all their lives is brilliantly done. Tom Murray created a unique piece of work. A mother whose loving determination, strength and devotion is the reason Christopher is who he is today. She is incredibly gifted and dignified as is the entire family. My husband and I watched this and were moved beyond words. The Murray family are an inspiration to everyone. It is a courageous piece, bold but honest and sincere. I highly recommend this to all.",1298073600,2,510,4.941860465116279

I'd seen DAD'S IN HEAVEN.. several times before I purchased the DVD when it was released and offered by AMAZON.  I've passed it around to family... everyone has the same response.  ""It was wonderful... want to watch again.""  Tom Murray and his brother will be forever in my memory.  The authenticity of Chris Murray's disability was there on the screen, not portrayed by an actor.  You'll fall in love with Chris... his innocence makes him so loveable... The scene with Chris taking his aging Mom's arm on a wooded path so she wouldn't stumble is profound.  Chris will make you laugh more than cry. Hard to describe... you just have to see this incredible documentary - love story - family history, for yourself.

4208281,5,B003V8BE12,"I stumbled upon this film recently on Showtime, watched it through, pressed the record button, and immediately watched it a second time. There are lots of good film treatments of autism and you don't really need this film to tell you that children with autism can indeed often grow up to lead happy and useful lives--and everyone by now knows that some people with autism have extraordinary abilities.  That's not really what the film is about.  It's ultimately a tribute to how the devotion and love within a family can often transcend tragedy and loss. Don't miss this.",1293408000,7,571,4.816326530612245
4208282,5,B003V8BE12,"This is a delightful film, offering an honest portrayal of a man's life and the extraordinary influence his brother had on him.  The man portrayed really is Tom Murray, the creator of the film, rather than his brother Chris.  Although he pays tribute to his mother's desire for and devotion to the child others said she should put away, Tom really tells a family story and the impact of his grandfather and father on his own life.  So the description of the movie doesn't seem quite accurate and yet his brother's story is told as well.  Because that story is told, we get a glimpse into the way Chris thinks and responds to others and to his life and it is beautiful.",1293148800,5,668,4.450819672131147

Indeed, my daughter cried when she watched the video.  Ryan, her son, was diagnosed at the age of 3.  He is now almost 12.  He is going through a tough time as he enters adolescence.
I think this video is educational and would be an encouragement to anyone who knows an autistic person.",1288483200,3,526,4.371134020618556

The story goes on to tell about how he works two jobs and enjoys painting and lives his own life, on his own.  Anyone with a niece, nephew, child or sibling with autism should watch this movie if for no other reason than to give hope that one day it is possible for them to live a happy, ""normal"" life and self sufficient.  My 7 year old nephew has autism, and this story gives me hope that one day he will be able to do the same for himself.  It's a tear jerker but I think you will find it a worthwhile film.

4208286,5,B003V8BE12,"I stumbled upon this film on Showtime while channel surfing and what a find it was.  I had probably missed about the first 15 minutes, but I was mesmerized from the get go.  Fortunately, I watched it again in its entirety.  There are just so many elements here, you can't pigeonhole it as a movie about autism or mental illness, or family tragedy or triumph.  It's all of those, and the glue is the love of Mrs. Murray, who held her family together in the face of bipolar disorder and the resulting loss of a very comfortable lifestyle, as well as seeing the potential in the face of her autistic son Chris rather than institutionalizing him as she was advised to do.  You have to give a parent credit in that era, when special needs children were sent away, for making the commitment to raise her child.  I can't say enough about this film!",1285286400,2,841,4.428571428571429

This true story touched me in numerous ways and is very thought provoking.  It is brilliantly done.  Chris's story is so amazing and beautiful.  His mother is educated, level headed, tireless and an incredible human being.  How she endured all that she was dealt is difficult to understand only because there aren't enough mother's like her in this world.  Tom Murray has done a great justice by making this film.  Because there is now autism in our family this film gave me beautiful hope and understanding for the future.  God Bless Tom & Chris Murray & their family.",1280707200,18,724,4.465648854961832
8406470,4,B003V8BE12,"I enjoyed the way this film unfolded and revealed several ironies.  Amazed by how family members were non-judgmental on camera of their dad.  They just spoke of the facts and how he affected them.  Mom is the rock and heroine of the family; quite a strong, loving woman.  Chris is amazing in many ways.  Totally lovable, talented, and a miracle resulting from a loving family's dedication to his growth and well-being.  I wonder if siblings are afflicted by bi-polar challenges since it's genetic.  I also wonder how they pieced their lives back together after their father lost it all.  Maybe they had trust funds from grandparents?  Also wonder if the sibs stuck together or drifted apart, aside from Tommy and Chris' friendship and brotherhood.  Would enjoy a follow-up film.  I fear for Chris when mom passes away.  He seems very fragile with such a strong connection with her.  Fortunately, his life is full of productive outlets that may serve as a distraction from grief.  I wish this family the best.",1525392000,,1008,4.852941176470588
