7283179,5,B00ZJYVJUW,Excellent pairing of stop motion films. All very good movies.,1446422400,,61,5.2
7283180,3,B00ZJYVJUW,"If you already own the 4 movies in this collection, Them, Son of Kong, Mighty Joe Young, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, do not waste your money on this collection. $43.00. I will be posting updates as I finish each disc. I will star with Them, and The Son of Kong. The print quality is better than DVD version. The special features are the same as the DVD nothing new. The sound is much better than the DVD. Next up Son of Kong, I did not find anything on the Blu Ray that makes it better than the DVD. The only reason i upgraded to Blu Ray was I had a store credit, so it did not coast me the full price. Stat Tuned for updates on  the other 2 in the set.",1446163200,,656,3.9323308270676693
7283181,4,B00ZJYVJUW,"I have seen each of these films many times through the years, but in all four cases this is the best looking presentation I have ever seen. It's like seeing a first generation 35mm print. Unfortunately, the copy protection made these disks unplayable on any player that was connected to a computer. They played smoothly on the player connected to my television, but nothing I did could get them to play on a computer drive. Internal or external. And I tried 3 - all with latest firmware. Once I made DRM free copies, they played fine. So if you watch blu rays on your computer, be warned.",1446076800,,588,4.5046728971962615
7283182,5,B00ZJYVJUW,"Discs and Movies are excellent, packaging is another story. The outer slipcase , while quite attractive is just too tight. The inner  slipcases are are merely cardboard , bound together . The most glaring thing I'm concerned about it that  rather than praising Ray Harryhausen's maiden , solo, stop motion model effort The Beast From 20.000 Fathoms is referred to  "" as a fantastic creature (constructed at full scale, all 50 tons of it)"", in it's liner notes. Almost makes it worth the difference in price buying the titles individually. Still I'm thrilled to finally have these on Blu-ray so I'm not deducting a star",1445904000,5,618,4.866666666666666

OK, I received mine today and I have already watched Them and Beast. They're so awesome in quality that I'm in awe.

HOWEVER, I have bad things to say about the packaging. It's a cardboard slipcase that is very rigid,
hard even, and a fold out disc holder insert that holds each disk in it's own individual section with a little blurb.
That should theoretically slide in and out of the slipcase very easily, at least in the designer's mind.

The huge problem is that the insert is a complete b**ch to get in and out. Grrr... The slipcase is so rigid that it has no
give and after trying 5-6 times, and even trying to loosen the cardboard up by flexing it over and over, I've decided to set
the slipcase aside and only have the insert with the disks on display in my Blu Ray collection. Kind of a mild bummer
but again, the movies make up for it, and I can't wait to watch the other two tomorrow.

Overall this set is highly recommended for the value of all 4 together, even if it isn't perfect, but just 90%.
That's close enough IMO.

ORIGINAL ENTRY:
I thought I would just lend credence to another seller's review correcting this listing to 4 separate disks, not 1.
I just verified on an expert Blu-Ray site that it is indeed 4, not 1 disk. Sorry, but I'm not allowed to list which one.

Still, it's an amazing collection that I very much look forward to owning. THEM rules!!!",1441843200,10,1517,4.800766283524904
7283185,5,B00ZJYVJUW,"I have all of these films on DVD, and the transfers look good. Still, these 4 movies are so much fun that I will upgrade to Blu-ray HD as that bump in resolution really makes an improved quality difference. The 1949 original version of ""Mighty Joe Young,"" included in this set, is one of the best and most underrated movies of all time. While the 1933 somewhat forgotten sequel to King Kong, ""Son of Kong,"" is the weakest film of this set, it is still a fun experience as the effects work is leading class for the era.",1438214400,13,518,4.295918367346939

7283188,5,B00ZJYVJUW,Absolutely fantastic sound picture quality nice pictures on Blu-ray case as some extras such as the trailer And how they did this special effects,1458259200,,145,5.083333333333333
7283189,5,B00ZJYVJUW,"I had read some negative reviews about this set, but wanted these films on Blu Ray if the quality was worth the upgrade. To my eyes, these new Blu Ray transfers look and sound better than their DVD counter parts. Each film looks and sounds about as good as you can expect from films from this era and production costs.

The packaging which I had heard so many complain about is actually pretty nice. I admit the outer case was a little tight, but after my second attempt to pull the inner sleeve out it did come out fairly easy. (This may not be the case for each individual case) I also do not have a problem with these types of inner sleeves. I have many with this sort of packaging and my discs look brand new.

As for the movies, they all look really good here with nothing to complain about. Them! is a little inconsistent, but considering a lot of this film takes place in a sand storm it is more due to the filming process than the transfer. These movies were made on a small budget and they have never looked better.

Son of Kong for me is an underrated little gem, sure it pales in comparison to the original, but it's the first sequel to poke fun at the original ( at least to my knowledge) It starts out smart, with Carl Denem being hounded by bill collector's and being indicted for the deaths and damage caused by Kong. It does get contrived from there, but it is still a very fun film with wonderful special effects and an ending that is very haunting and memorable. The film looked great on DVD, but it does look and sound better here. Unfortunately it does not get any extras other than a trailer. This is a missed opportunity as I think it would be most welcome to fans to learn more about this quick sequel to arguably the greatest giant monster film in the history of cinema.

Mighty Joe Young is another underrated classic with even more impressive stop motion and Harryhausen's first feature film.  Even though O'Brian was present and takes the credit, it is obvious this is pretty much all Harryhausen just by the character instilled in his stop motion creatures. Once again the film was already available on a great looking DVD, but it is an improvement here both in picture and sound. The extras are decent, but nothing we haven't seen before.

The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms is another Harryhausen film (technically his first and only solo effort). This is one of the best sc-fi monster films from the 50's with a great monster, solid story and wonderful special effects by the master. With a budget of around $200,000 no one else but Ray Harryhausen could pull this off and it's amazing how well this film holds up. Once again this film is a marked improvement over the DVD release. The extras are carried over from the special edition DVD with nothing added, I'm just glad they carried over the extras from the previous release.

The last film on the set is another 50's classic Them!  I have always preferred stop motion monsters to puppets and men in rubber suits or props, but the ants are just so vivid in this film, their images have stuck with me my entire life. It's one of the best of it's kind with a great story, special effects and of course great monsters! This film is an improvement over the DVD, but given the conditions this was filmed under, sand storms, dark lit tunnels, there is some grain and inconsistencies here and there. I can't see how anyone could complain about the transfer though as it looks pretty darn good and I doubt it will ever look better. Only a few tid bits here as extras including the trailer.

It should be noted that all of the trailers look very good and not nearly as battered as we are used to seeing. Could this set have been better? Yes, there should be more extras and maybe, there could have been a little more attention to the transfers, but really, I'm glad to have them looking this good and I doubt we will see better versions anytime soon if ever.

7283193,5,B00ZJYVJUW,"I'm really ""Gurumama"" 's husband:  What I love most is the quality of the content of each except for ""THEM!""  To me, ""THEM!"" seems a little darker and contrastier than the DVD.  But otherwise STILL a great film!  A lifelong fan of ""SON OF KONG"", ""MIGHTY JOE YOUNG"" and ""THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS"".  Still relevant and highly entertaining movies.  The bar has been raised with the Blu-Ray versions as they now show more detail thanks to an extra helping of improved half-tones which I much appreciate.  This makes them all the more enjoyable for me to watch again and again.  A great set of titles for fans of Ray Harryhausen, Willis O'Brien and Warner Brothers science fiction.  For people in this league, definitely worth the price to have them.  Okay, yes, the slipcase is tight but that's all right by me.  I just don't use it.  Problem solved.  Buyers should know that the ""THEM!"" disc is formatted for wide screen.  Why this is when the other three are full format, I have no idea.  Its distracting for me because the original theatrical release was the traditional 1.75:1 aspect ratio.  This means a total of 18% of the image has been cut off.  Aside from that, I am grateful to Warner Bros. for releasing these four titles, some of my favorites, in Blu-ray versions.",1450137600,2,1277,4.629464285714286

8720452,5,B00ZJYVJUW,"Watched 3 out of 4 of these films now -- all via a fine JVC projector on a ten foot screen, and wow! I could not be more pleased.  They look better seen this way than they likely did to most viewers in first run theaters back when they were new.  Just gorgeous.

""Them"" especially stood out.  The rich blacks were carefully calibrated to keep shadow detail, the whites to do likewise but -- especially in the daylight desert scenes -- to glow.

Oddly the film was in the 16:9 format, and that means that some top and bottom image had to have been cut.  But such was never apparent.  Even the titles appeared perfectly framed that way.

""The Beast from Twenty Thousand Fathoms"" has long been another favorite of mine.  I saw it, too, in the theater on first release. And it, too, holds up beautifully as mastered here.

""Mighty Joe Young"" is a fun film. One I'd not seen in many, many years. And it, too, was a delight.

The packaging was fine.  We experienced no issues with the slip case being too tight.

The only wish I'd have is for more specials. 'The Beast' had a few. ""Them"" almost none. All deserve more than a few.

Maybe I am showing my age, but these films offer something rarely found today.  A sense of joyous wonder. Add that to special effects good enough to not be seen as such, good and witty scripts and fine performances.  What more could one wish for for a Sunday matinee?",1489968000,,1392,4.337209302325581
