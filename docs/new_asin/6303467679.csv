So, to the powers that be in charge of EEK, pretty please, with sugar on top, GIVE US AN EEK DVD!",1270512000,4,246,3.660377358490566
7847801,5,6303467679,"Many people have been wishing and hoping that Eek would be released on DVD for years, so make them happy!  I wish Eek the Cat would be released on DVD in 2009 or 2010, whichever comes first.  Please release Eek the Cat on DVD, with no stalling!",1213315200,5,244,4.170212765957447
7847802,5,6303467679,"Eek! the Cat was a cartoon I fondly remember watching after school on my back porch and loving every minute. I think some of the more intellectual throwbacks went over my head at the time, but I remember loving Eek himself and how great he was and helpful he wanted to be. I loved his adventures and just couldn't get enough of him. I remember seeing a stuffed animal of him in a toy store and I bought it immediately!

I would love to see this on DVD, though I know that is not meant to be. Even as an adult I think I can still get much fun from watching this cartoon. A part of my childhood, I'd like the chance for a bit of nostalgia. It reminds me of a time when cartoons seemed to mean something and wanted to teach the audience something--not always, but surely more than they do now. I think cartoons of the 80's had way more substance than the computer churn outs we get today. I love you Eek!",1212451200,6,901,4.119318181818182
7847803,5,6303467679,"If you never watched Eek the Cat, which was on Fox more or less back to back with The Tick back when Saturday morning cartoons had yet to be invaded by Japan in the mid to early 90's, I can tell you that it was an extremely cynical, usually hilarious, often brilliant and occasionally existential series focused around the activities of the happy-go-lucky Eek who when not saving the world seems to spend most of his time wooing his extraordinarily obese girlfriend Annabelle and getting bitten by her guard dog Sharky the Sharkdog. It's a scream. Lots of components of it probably went skyscrapers over the heads of the young target audience but it was just so densely packed with awesomeness that it appealed to the kiddies enough nonetheless to survive what surely must have been around a hundred episodes. Frankly I'd want to invest in whatever company owns the rights to this the day before they decide to get off their butts and put the entire Eek series on DVD because they stand to make an enormous pile of money if they do and I'd like to swim in that pile of money right along with them, Uncle Scrooge style. Unless it's an individual. Then I guess I'd have to hope it's a woman and try to marry her...

This tape is of course just a tiny snippet of all that is Eek. Maybe 2 percent of it. I'd recommend you try to contain yourself and pass it up and await the motherload which SURELY will come out eventually.",1195516800,4,1420,4.461538461538462
7847804,5,6303467679,"Whoever has the license and rights to this show is wasting them. These need to come to DVD, and more of them. I have friends that don't even buy Tv to DVD and they are waiting for this to happen! This was the greatest cartoon ever made in the history of animation. I use to watch this in Highschool and it would be nice to see it come back, especially since all the episodes I taped wore out before technology allowed me to presever them on digital media. Seriously, someone needs to release season 1 and just watch the response!",1155686400,13,529,4.3
7847805,5,6303467679,"When Eek came on Fox I was in my 20's and it came on early on Saturday's (at least for a 20 something!), but I NEVER missed an episode!!!  I love Eek and I am always saying in a slurred little voice: It never hurts to help.

Bring Eek to DVD!!!!!

Long live Eek and long live Savage Steve!!!!

A fan in Omaha.",1154217600,13,309,3.857142857142857
7847806,5,6303467679,"At the end of DIC's Sabrina cartoon there's a little blurb that says ""We love you, Steve,"" referring to Savage Steve Holland. If you love Steve, then release his best creation, Eek the Cat and the Terrible Thunderlizards on DVD. Who knows why this didn't come out in numerous videos? Who really knows why it's not out on DVD? Even Pinky and the Brain is coming in June 2006.

For those who came in late, Eek is a rotund, lethargic cat (no, not that rotund lethargic cat-- Eek is purple) who's motto is ""It never hurts to help."" The show's moral, such as it is, however is somewhat at odds with that: that no good deed ever goes unpunished. Then you have Eek's unique interjection, ""kum ba yah!"" and the caveman's oft repeated line, ""I hate my life.""

All in all, not your everyday cartoon. No wonder so many viewers are waiting for Savage Steve's unique and memorable cartoon to hit DVD.",1145318400,18,887,4.469135802469136
7847807,5,6303467679,"Although not the best episodes of this great show, it is still good to see Eek on video. Filled with sight gags and references to pop culture and other movies and shows, you have to watch it two or three times to get them all. Great entertainment for kids and adults alike. Really funnny stuff here. Savage Steve Holland (Better Off Dead), Bill Kopp (Mad Jack the Pirate and others) and crew really did this one up right. I wish they had released more episodes, but the goons at Fox didn't know a true hit when they had one. These two episodes are from the first season and pretty much show all the major characters. Don't get me wrong, this video is definitely worth the money! If you are a long time fan of Eek! or someone who wants to know what its all about this is the video, the only video currently for you! ...",1019952000,24,818,4.25
