8556132,4,B00AQ62DP8,"A lot of Trekkers turn up their noses at the animated version, which is unfortunate because it really is better than you remember it (or better than you think it is if you've never seen it).  As for the arguments over whether or not it is ""really"" Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry was in control, most of the original cast returned as voice actors, and many of the episodes were written by writers on either the original series or later series or both.  How could it NOT be Star Trek?

The writing is arguably the best thing about this series.  ""Yesteryear"" is arguably the standout, a time travel adventure in which Spock saves himself as a child; several elements of this episode have become canon through later reuse whether anyone cares to admit it or not.  Other great episodes are ""More Tribbles, More Troubles"", a sequel to ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" written by the same author; ""The Slaver Weapon"" adapted by Larry Niven from his own short story; and the first Star Trek episode of any series to win an Emmy, ""How Sharper than a Serpent's Tooth"".

The Bad?  Well, the animation is just plain awful, not poorly drawn or anything like that (some of the alien designs and background matte paintings are astonishing) but EXTREMELY limited, even for 70's era TV.  As more than one commentator notes, the animation is almost as difficult to watch today as are the special effects on the original series (Ouch!).  Second, like so many American children's broadcast TV shows then and since, violence has been almost completely eliminated.  With the single exception of some bad guys who blow themselves up in ""The Slaver Weapon"", nobody dies, not humans, not aliens, not monsters, not even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Redshirts/dp/B00FZ0A4AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Redshirts</a>!

Trekkers who haven't seen it (or haven't seen it in decades) owe themselves a second look at the series that attracted new fans and kept the Star Trek universe alive between the end of the original series and the first movie.

Note: The packaging for this set is an example of too much attempted on too small a displacement: beautiful but, oh, so fragile.  Buyers would be wise to open and examine the set upon purchase (or just return it unopened for replacement if you can hear broken plastic rattling around inside).",1450742400,7,2347,5.064935064935065
