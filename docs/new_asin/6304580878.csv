899730,5,6304580878,"A horse named Glory and a girl named Clarabelle head off the cast of this entertaining David Butler-produced drama from 1956.  Using the backdrop of horse-racing millionaires and white trash in and around Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky, film mixes studio sequences with stock footage taken at the 1955 Kentucky Derby, cleverly mixed in so you will hardly know which is real and which is just storybook fantasy.

Margaret O'Brien, the beloved child star of so many MGM films of the 1940s, was cast as Clarabelle, the independent, intensely feminine granddaughter of tough old Charlotte Greenwood.  Butler's film has many virtues but he does not seem to have given either of his great stars any direction.  O'Brien is charming in some sequences, and you want to like her, but often her expressions seem frozen as though some stage mother offstage is whispering to her, ""Now hold that smile.""  And when she sings, she seems awkward and ill at ease.  Elsewhere, however, she is surprisingly alluring and her costumes, from blue jeans to formals, are to die for.  Greenwood, I hate to say it because I love her, is scary in this one, harsh, cold, and loud, and the writers thought it would be cute to have her in a romance with Walter Brennan that involves the two of them throwing outrageous insults at each other at the top of their lungs and over a period of many years.

Glory is a filly born during a furious thunderstorm, but sort of a hard luck horse like Seabiscuit, slow to find her footing in the competitive world of the track.  Glory is played by a variety of different horses, including one that seems obviously painted brown to fit in with the other horses playing the part!  The racing stuff is first-rate, it's the plot itself that grows tired, as over and over again ""thrifty"" Charlotte Greenwood determines to sell little Glory, for she eats as many oats as a winner, and then Margaret O'Brien goes ballistic trying to buy her back.

Clarabelle has two suitors, both ultra good looking, one is Chad, the millionaire playboy owner of Louisville's oldest horse farm, and the other is Hoppy, a bigtime bandleader slash record producer slash dj who offers to make her a singer of international renown (yes, she sings pop music too).  John Lupton, as Chad Chadburn, is properly aristocratic and dashing in a role that forces him to appear to be engaged to a trollop-y rich girl Candy Trent, while Byron Palmer, as the bandleader, is a bit down the social scale but he's tall, dark and handsome if you like them in the Jack Carson mode.  The film looks terrific, and the color cinematography by Will Cline, who made most of the Warner Bros. Doris Day musicals, is intensely moody and romantic and adds a deep focus glamor to the merest of details--the fabric of car seats, the glint off the playing cards, the shine of a trumpet.

Film also has a great part for Theron Jackson, one of the many underused black actors of the 1950s, who's great in this movie as Alexander, the groom with a brain and a plan.",1217808000,4,3016,4.676748582230624
899731,4,6304580878,"""Glory Daze"" is truly funny.  Ben Affleck as a punk rocker, Sam Rockwell as the whipped boyfriend, a cameo from Matthew McConaughey as a drunk car salesman (of sorts), and French Stewart as a perpetual student, it's just classic.  It's not the greatest movie ever, but it's worth owning.  I saw it in 2000 and tried to find a copy of it for years before I finally got one through Amazon.  Get ahold of the soundtrack if you like punk music.  It's great!",1197936000,,453,4.409638554216867
899732,4,6304580878,"This film is good for a giggle. Not a classic, but something to pull down off the shelf when you're after a laugh. Quite abstract and off beat with some of it's jokes it makes for an intelligent comedy (rare for the college comedy genre films such as 'American Pie').

Young adults facing the question of ""What comes next in life"" should relate quite well to the films main character played nicely by the talented actor Ben Affleck before he made it big.

If you're after a witty (sometimes bitter) comedy this is for you.

Fans of punk rock will love the soundtrack, especially the Vandals song ""It's A Fact"".

If any of the above sounds interesting to you, do yourself a favour and check out this film.",1153008000,4,704,4.4765625
899733,2,6304580878,"Slick like a MTV video, rap pulsating in the background, punky
post-grunge set and clothing, Glory Daze amuses, but it's shallow,clichd amusement. The senior year at college winds down and all the stereo-types jam a run down student's house. The beer flows, the girls hang around for what reason I don't know (duh), and the furniture is smashed. Cool huh? OK, my senior year wasn't much different back in 69, just more drugs, but what did we learn? For most kids, we didn't learn a
whole lot. That's why it's tough to make immature personalities come alive in film. It takes a real artist, but what the hell, last chance to make a fool of yourself without consequence, usually.",1114387200,3,677,4.697478991596639
899734,1,6304580878,"This movie is terrible.  The script is bad, and the acting is even worse.  There are virtually no laughs the entire movie, the characters are boring and uninteresting.",1111276800,6,167,4.928571428571429
899735,5,6304580878,"I love this movie from beginning to end. I rented it in 1997 and immediately bought a VHS copy. As soon as the dvd hit the shelves, it was mine. I turned my old roommate onto this film (in '98) and he started watching it almost every day. We even built a bar for our little ""party house"" at the time and quoted this film all the time. I thought the characters were very believable because I was one of them myself (liked punk, hated authority and never wanted the party to end). Affleck is excellent as is the rest of the cast. You would swear these guys were really great friends as the chemistry seemed very real. I am 35 now with a wife and 3 year old son, but I still put Glory Daze in at least once a month, just to remember the good old days of little responsibility and nothing but the mysterious future up ahead.",1107216000,2,820,4.13125
899736,1,6304580878,"I find it both amusing and horrifying that legendary underground cinema star Brian Strauss -- who appears briefly in this film and upstages future screen star Ben Affleck and noted burnout Alyssa Milano -- made his final screen appearance (to date) in an uncredited, unrecognized cameo in this crappy film. (He is in the restaurant scene near the end, when Affleck stops to melodramatically deface the window.) Before becoming a Pynchon-esque recluse, Strauss graced avant cinema classics such as Do the Rice Thing, The Life and Tymes of Doo Doo Brown, Baxter the Killer Squirrel, and Watch Out!, just to name a few. Who could forget his emotionally tour de force in the later, as Cragmont the mentally handicapped groundskeeper? Or his oft-quoted ""eat this powdered sugar..."" soliloquy from Do the Rice Thing? The films Mr. Strauss made during his brief heyday (roughly 1992 to 1996) radically altered the American Independent cinema, and leveled a searing critique at voracious consumer society, tired (...) PC-protected quasi-sociological tribalism, sobriety, and outmoded notions of acceptable personal hygiene (see his fearless plunge into Temescal in Watch Out!). That this miserable movie (whether you refer to it as Glory Daze or it's earlier, more literal-minded title Cruz) remains the most widely known film from Mr. Struss' oeuvre is a savage indictment of the collective tastes of this nation and, indeed, film enthusiasts world wide. For shame!

They all have problems but each one works it out in the end. Cameos by Matthew McConaughey(Reign Of Fire), Brendan Fraser(Looney Toons:Back In Action), Leah Remini(Old School) and Matt Damon(Dogma, Gerry) spark this movie. other cast members include Megan Ward(Arcade), Meredith Salenger(Lake Placid,The Kiss), John Rhys-Davies(The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy),Spalding Gray(Kate & Leopold,How High) and Alyssa Milano(tv's Charmed and Fear). great beginning, middle and ending. a good view

899799,5,6304580878,"OK, I'm not a film student/critic of any kind, but I saw this movie about 4 months before I graduated college, and it really struck a chord with me.
Brief synopsis: The focus is on five college roommates who are close friends, some of whom are facing graduation in a week or so. What follows is how they react to the group being broken up, and how they spend time together before going their separate ways.
Ben Affleck actually turns in a fairly good performance as a disaffected slacker type who chose to pursue an art degree despite his parents' wishes; French Stewart is his typical self despite his role as a ""professional student"", but I thought the best performance in the movie was turned in by Sam Rockwell. To top it all off, some hilarious bit parts with Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon (it's quick, and he doesn't say a word), as well as Spalding Gray, who plays Affleck's dad.
There are some heavy-handed pieces of symbolism -- check out the very end of the scene when ""We're Only Going to Die for Our Own Arrogance"" is being played -- but then again, college was rarely about metaphors, and (for me, anyway) more often about friends, parties, and cheap beer. I think anyone who has spent time living with several of their close friends, in college or otherwise, and then has had to go their separate ways, will enjoy this film.
Sometimes films don't have to be artistic or expensive to be good; they just have to tell a story that people will enjoy watching again and again. For me, this is one of those stories.
P.S. - An outstanding punk soundtrack, including NOFX, The Vandals, The Mr. T Experience, the New Bomb Turks, and a pretty good cover of the above mentioned Bad Religion song by Sublime.",1053475200,2,1712,4.561688311688312
899800,5,6304580878,"i had never heard of this movie until my old college roommate showed it to me.  he had an old, beaten up copy he made while he was in the army.  i have a very broad taste in movies.  when he showed me the tape, i recognized some names and figured i'd give it a shot.  i had no idea how much this movie would hit home.  at the time, we threw wild parties at our off-campus flop house.  our place generally was as trashed as ""El Rancho"", the house in the movie.  every character in the movie will remind any college student of someone they knew.  this movie is funny, but definately has a serious message if you are willing to pay attention to the details.  all these things aside, this movie is not going to win an academy award.  BUT, if you want to remember the good old college days and don't want to watch your typical ""teeniebopper"" show that the studios ""churn out year after year"", then you HAVE to see this movie.  (forgive the quotations, but if you watch the movie, you'll understand)  by the way, matthew mcconaughey gives a cameo that is HILARIOUS.  for those of you who would rather rent it first rather than buy it, it is a sundance film festival movie (i worked at blockbuster).  be sure to check this one out!",1047513600,2,1224,4.265217391304348
899801,5,6304580878,"I actually never saw or heard of this movie before until I purchased it from amazon.com, and as soon as I watched it, I am glad I did.  Ben Affleck plays Jack, a 22 year old man, who is graduating from college, and he has to accept the fact that life has to move on.  The supporting cast which includes Alyssa Milano, Megan Ward, and French Stewart were great as well.  I really enjoyed this movie!  I am so glad that I purchased this movie, I absolutely adore it.",1013212800,2,464,4.179775280898877
899802,4,6304580878,"I bought Glory Daze just because I am a Ben Affleck fan. I didn't expect much. I am 38 years old and I thought that the story of a bunch of college graduates would have nothing to do with me. Boy, was I wrong ! Only 10 minutes into the movie I could see myself portrayed in those characters. Although the movie was shot with young people, for young people and about young people, there are certain things that stay with you as you mature and Glory Daze sure manages to pull some of my emotional strings. The actors are all fine. We get to see French Stewart from 3rd Rock from the Sun, Alyssa Milano from Who's the Boss and Charmed, and Brendan Fraser in a small part. There's also a very small scene with Matt Damon. Ben Affleck delivers such a powerful performance. He really knows how to touch you with his sensitive portrayal. It always amazes me his capability of deep emotions at such an early age. This is pretty rare in young actors. It makes you wonder what was Ben's emotional background. A pretty intense one I suppose ! Glory Daze is a must for any Ben Affleck fan and will be enjoyed by young people of all ages. Finally it has come out on DVD. And I can't wait to get my hands on it ! :)",1004832000,,1201,4.181034482758621
899803,1,6304580878,"I really didn't like this movie. The reason I rented it was because it had a familiar cast and the plot seemed followable. But it really wasn't very good. I think you'd have to have some huge thing in common with the characters to like it. Also, I expected there to be some bad words since it is rated R, but come on, 101 times is just too much. You can make a point another way. Don't rent this.",996105600,,396,4.025316455696203
899804,5,6304580878,I first saw this movie as a freshmen in college and didn't really understand it.  Now as I am graduating it makes perfect sense.  They express every thought and feeling that every college student feels.  I watch this movie at least twice a week.  This is a great college flick which harkens back to the days of Animal House with a 90's twist.  This movie will be a classic!!!,985478400,,375,4.3768115942028984
899805,5,6304580878,"I have seen this movie more times than I can count on my fingers and toes.  I went to a small college and while I was there my friends and I discovered Glory Daze.  This movie perfectly captures the life of a small college.  We thought so and it kind of became our anthem.  The film follows the lives of a group of housemates as the inevitable graduation approaches in a few days.  Then they will go their separate ways.  Through the course of this movie one funny thing after another happens.  They have a party, they talk about life and love, graduate, and break stuff.  Like I said this movie is sentemental to me and most people I show it to that do not come from similar perspective are disappointed.  I would recommend it to people who went to small colleges or die hard Affleck fans.",973036800,,790,4.319727891156463
899806,5,6304580878,"Glory Daze is an excellent movie, as long as you can handle 90's post-teen and punk-like attitudes! Ben Affleck delivers a stunningly real performance (as he did in Chasing Amy) and his on screen prensence is gritty,  it gives  a true-to-life feeling to the movie. And the supporting cast is rather  stellar considering this movie was released so low-key. My biggest draw to  this movie has to be the moral dillemas and friendships- much of this movie  mirrored my own last two years, and not many movies seem as realistic. The  soundtrack is also stellar. If you want an example of some great modern  punk/ska bands, pick up this soundtrack. Overall, if you find Kevin Smith's  type's of films entertaining(Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma) you  should have no problem loving this movie as much as I do!  A definite  must-buy for any movie lover!",952646400,,851,4.840277777777778
899807,4,6304580878,"I admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I never expected to see a semi-major star like Ben Affleck play a drunk/punk/skater in a raucous comedy, but he pulls it off well.  I suppose I liked the movie more  than most because I was once in Jack's (Ben Affleck's character) position,  and it was a hell of a lot of fun, but at times it was scary, because once  you graduate, everyone expects you to put down the beerbong and pick up a  briefcase, which is a hell of a transition.  The characters were weird, out  of control, and at times larger-than-life, but it's exactly what you see in  ""party"" houses around college campuses all around the country,  especially in California. Alyssa Milano, Vien Hong, and French Stewart all  play their parts stylishly, but Affleck is the star of the show - he even  had me believing he was a Screeching Weasel and Op Ivy fan.  I recommend  this movie to anyone who's interested to know what the non-frat boy college  party life is really like, but please don't think that people like NOFX as  much as is portrayed in this film.  I think Fat Mike (lead vocalist for  NOFX and owner of Fat Wreck Chords) must have had a hand in supplying the  soundtrack, hats, and t-shirts for Glory Daze, because it was a little  silly to see and hear so many references to NOFX!  In my opinion this is a  must-see comedy, almost like a 90's version of Animal House, and I commend  Affleck for taking a chance on this role.",949536000,,1458,4.418867924528302
899808,4,6304580878,"I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. Thankfully, I was wrong.  Affleck plays a young art student about to graduate from college in three days time.  He is faced with the fact that he is about to enter the world  of adulthood completely unprepared.  All he wants to do is stay with his  friends and keep partying. The dialogue is dead-on, very realistic. In  fact, this was a really good coming of age story in the tradition of Diner  (yes, really!), but with a lot of 90s references/outlooks. It also has a  hell of a lot of random cameos, all funny. Affleck is perfectly cast, as is  Milano, Sam Rockwell, and French Stewart. Wait'll you see what they do to  their poor off-campus housing in the end... preservation through  destruction! So go see it!",944524800,6,763,4.5777777777777775
