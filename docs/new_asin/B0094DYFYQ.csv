5261229,5,B0094DYFYQ,"I saw Australian Pink Floyd in concert recently. At their show they were selling two DVD's, $30 each. I thought, wow, too expensive and held off. I saw the show and was blown away. What a show, what incredible energy, what music! Well no vendors after the show. I ordered both here on Amazon and could not be happier! Australian Pink Floyd is an Experience. Glad I can have such experience captured on DVD. The snippets of interviews with the band are great as well.
A No brainer purchase if you are a fan.
(FYI... Mine played in my NTSC hardware though I didn't see any specification on DVD or packaging.)",1353283200,2,606,4.468468468468468
5261230,5,B0094DYFYQ,"Exposed In The Light is the second DVD offering the Pink Floyd tribute band, The Australian Pink Floyd Show - ""the biggest and most spectacular Pink Floyd Show on the planet"".

And what an incredible DVD it is.

I say that even on the heels of having had the privilege of, a) having just seen the show live here in the Dallas area and, b) interviewing the band's keyboardist, Jason Sawford.  The concert - and this DVD - is a treasure chest of massive stimulation, both audio and visual.

As my luck would have it, this particular DVD offers a show that is partially close to the set list they played while here.  The only way one could be any more pleased than that would be if these highly talented Aussie's were to follow the lead of The Who and offer attendees the opportunity to purchase CDs and DVDs of the show they attended.

But that's a topic for another conversation on down the road.

Back to the set list:  The DVD consists of Aussie Floyd's treatment of:

In The Flesh?
Astronomy Domine
Take It Back
Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun
High Hopes
Sheep
Time/Breathe Reprise
The Great Gig In The Sky
Pings (Three Different Ones)
The Fletcher Memorial Home
Keep Talking
Us and Them
One Of These Days
Comfortably Numb

Interspersed between the tunes are candid shots of the band during set up, rehearsals, on the tour bus, and other off-stage environments.  Watching them perform in all uber-seriousness and then watching their antics backstage and on the bus gives an entirely different perspective of this highly talented band and the crew that helps them make it all possible.

Viewing this superbly produced disc will give you a prime opportunity to learn why The Australian Pink Floyd is referred to as the ""gold standard"" of tribute bands by The Times Newspaper in London. Even if you already own the various Pink Floyd DVDs (either by the entire group or the solo offerings by the band members) or even the previous Australian Pink Floyd Show DVD (Live At The Hammersmith Apollo 2012), Pink Floyd and Australian Pink Floyd fans alike will definitely want to have Exposed In The Light as part of their private DVD library.
