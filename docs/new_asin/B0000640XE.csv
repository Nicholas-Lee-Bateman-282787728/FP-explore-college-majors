They even had fake snow which was OBVIOUSLY some kind of cottony blanket like material (like what they use in department storefront windows at Christmas time).  The other thing that had me rolling on the floor laughing was the way the ""boa"", that supposedly needed warmth, survived in subzero temps.
The bad language Dean Cain uses in this movie further detracts from the already bad acting.  This movie is destined for MST3K reruns.",1043280000,,500,4.858823529411764
1697211,2,B0000640XE,"It is hard to imagine a monster movie that goes so wrong in so many different ways. BOA would have the viewer believe that a ten million year old huge reptilian-like snake could emerge from a nitrogen induced suspended animation to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of an Antarctic prison.  Now I have no problem accepting the scientific implausibility of its sleeping for ten million years, after all, was the cloning of JURASSIC PARK any less believable?  The problem with audience involvement is that the cast and crew show little respect for anyone's intelligence. The criminal residents of the prison were supposed to be the 'worst of the worst.'  Yet, as I got to know them as individuals, they seemed a rather likable bunch. In fact, one of them, a nuclear missle smuggler, correctly identified himself as a political prisoner, a not inaccurate label since he intended to use that missle in defense of his homeland of Chechnya.  Further, when he was released rather unwillingly by the warden to help fight the snake, it is he rather than the titular hero (Dean Cain) who emerges as the go to guy who has guns and guts.  Cain, by contrast, seems wimpy and decidely uneager to tackle the snake, which, by the way, no one refers to as a boa. As for the snake itself, you would think that the advertised monster of any monster film would get plenty of screen time.  This snake is seen slithering around mostly in the shadows and only parts of its anatomy are revealed.  Rarely does the viewer get the snake's full monty.  Much of the dialogue is predictably banal and heavy-handedly foreshadowing.  When one of the criminals, an attractive IRA woman, tells Cain that because of her Irish fear of snakes, he should shoot her if the snake should capture her, then you know that is precisely what will happen.  Most of the movie borrows shamelessly from other 'big snake' movies like ANACONDA and PYTHON.  I have no problem with that either so long as the director does something novel with the borrowing.  Not so in BOA.  The best part was the grand finale, which involved the one who should have played the hero, the Chechnya missile smuggler.  Here the director did something right. Rather than rip off snake movies, he rips off AIR FORCE ONE with the smuggler taking the Gary Oldman role.  I am still trying to decide if the climax were dramatic or purposefully laughable.  And this might be the underlying problem of BOA: modest laughter or even more modest shuddering.",1029628800,11,2471,4.724941724941725

1697265,4,B0000640XE,"New Alcatraz (renamed Boa for release on VHS and DVD) is a horror film of sorts in that it features a large prehistoric snake that chomps and chews its way through the staff at a maximum-security prison located in Antarctica.  Dean Cain (as Dr. Robert Trenton) and his contentious wife (Elizabeth Lackey) are transported to the prison for reasons that don't entirely make sense as they study fossils, not live creatures.  The head of this isolated facility is an officious oaf, Warden Riley (played by Craig Wasson).  He has an alarming knack for making bad decisions that get people killed.  Boa was supposedly made to compete with Python II.  It failed miserably in this regard so they naturally had to make a sequel, Boa VS Python, which also failed to register, critical or otherwise.  As a monster flick, it does have a few moments of interest.  Its greatest shortcoming is with the plot.  Characters are introduced in blocks but are barely dealt with before passing on to another block of people, another segment of the story.  At one point, I forgot that Dead Cain was even in this movie because it was spending so much time in the prison.  Why they felt the need to give him a wife is anyone's guess (perhaps because there was only one other female character involved in the story).

As `monster' snake movies go...........it's better than nothing.  There's something goofy and likable about it that made me keep it for future viewings.  But it is barely adequate filmmaking at best.",1409961600,,1491,4.77734375

In my opinion it deserves 3 but I do not think that the overall average rating of 2.5 stars is fair. The only of the many flaws that bugged me was the change of size of the snake's blade in the tail.

Snakes are lovely creatures, and the CGI never does justice to their beauty.

  Anyway, my main problem with this movie? The cover. 'Boa' it says. OK, Boa Constrictor. The people behind this movie obviously did not do their homework on Boa Constrictors. Their teeth do not sit up front like venomous fangs. They sit in back, curved backwards, which is why a bite from a Boa would be painful.

  In conclusion, please, do not make more movies demonizing animals.

  After shooting one of thier own men, the military guys think they have the snake trapped. They shoot at it hitting a gas line which sits on fire for about a minute without exploding. That is just enough time for the boa to excape and the entire security crew to show up and die when the gas line finally does explode.

1697299,2,B0000640XE,"Another film in the never-ending series of ""Giant Animated Snake Eats People"" films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade.  The creators of a maximum-security prison in the Antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile.

There's nothing more to this film than that.  ""Boa"" (also known as ""New Alcatraz"") actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness, which I don't think was a smart idea.  The technical team - photography, production design-set decoration, etc. - create a fairly effective, chilling atmosphere, but everything else about ""Boa"" is strictly routine.

Dean Cain does a job I would describe as tolerable, although Elizabeth Lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife, and the supporting cast (Mark Sheppard, Grand L. Bush, Craig Wasson) is just a touch more professional.

The film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can't see just how fake it looks.

I don't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with; other, similar titles include ""Python"" 1 and 2, ""Anaconda"" (the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997) and ""Anaconda: Search for the Blood Orchid"", and the inevitable ""Boa Vs. Python"".

1697301,4,B0000640XE,"This is the first time I have ever written a review here, so I will try to make it as clean and clear as possible.
I personally think that Boa is a good action thriller with some horror themes.  It is about a large multi-national prison 20 kilometers north of the South Pole, built to house at least 25,000 prisoners!  The people at the prison are drilling deep down into the ice and snow when they drill through a rock chamber containing nitrogen gas and, more importantly, a 100-foot long pre-historic boa constrictor.
The snake is still alive after 65 billion years because the nitrogen gas in the rock chamber stopped the beast's aging process completely.  When the snake is released, it begins to kill devour people in the prison.  I should note that the snake uses some very skillful methods in killing its victims.  For example, not only does it constrict and bite its prey to death, it also has a sharp, deadly blade on its tail which it uses to stab and hack its victims to death.  As you can see, not only is the snake deadly, but it is also very smart!
What I liked about this movie is the concept of a snake living in the snow.  It is very a unique concept and I just think that it is so cool!
I don't know much about Dean Cain, but he did a really great job in this movie.  His acting really shows us what its like in a cold, snowy world where you're being hunted by a giant snake.
Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  I'm thinking about buying it soon!  I first saw it on the Sci Fi channel and I was inspired to think about buying it. If you like a giant snake in the snow, get this movie!
I hope this review was helpful to you.  The trick to this movie is to just watch it yourself and see what you think.  Don't just listen to what other people say about it.",1089936000,3,1777,4.194117647058824

1697303,2,B0000640XE,"It's hard to believe while watching BOA That Dean Cain once played Superman.  Here he is supergeek, pathetically underacting a role that wasn't even needed in the film.  Ditto to Elizabeth Lackey's lackluster performance as his obsessed paleontological wife.  Only Mark Sheppard as the Chechyan prisoner brings life into a role that should have been expanded.  His heroics at the end put Dean Cain in his place quite properly.
Now as for the snake, there were times it looked frighteningly real; other times it was quite obvious the movie's budget constricted its monster.  Craig Wasson who was so good in ""Body Double"" and ""Ghost Story"" horribly overacts his role as the Warden.  The finale is quite good, and unexpected compared to the movie itself.

1697304,1,B0000640XE,"""Boa"" isn't the worst movie ever. Actually, yes it is. This movie from director Phillip Roth (Velocity Trap, Falcon Down) is a triumph in bad filmmaking. It's predictable every step of the way, right down to how the giant snake is going to tear its prey apart. It's about as likable as ""It's Pat: The Movie,"" only a little funnier. The special effects are terrible, hard to see, and very confusing at times. UFO LLC usually has some pretty sweet effects in their flicks, but this movie is different. It suffers from minimal visibility and a terrible lack of anything scary, let alone coherent, in the film. At least Dean Cain got a paycheck. As long as he's making a movie, I suppose the world is a better place. As long as it's not ""Boa 2: Snakes Alive.""",1044748800,3,755,4.478260869565218

7960047,3,B0000640XE,"RBTV=Really Bad TV. In the past few years I've hunted Burmese Pythons and Green Anacondas in Florida. 8-12 ft is common, some caught by others over 18 feet. Unlike the movie snake, they never growl, they never chew their food but swallow it whole, and never spear their prey with the tip of their tales. One thing was accurate, you shoot at big snakes, they get really mad. They hunt by vibration as in the movie....but no mention or sight of the forked tongue or mention of infrared sensor most all snake have to hunt by body heat. One actress with a different name playing the IRA killer girl/prisoner, looks like Amanda Tapping from the Star Gate series. Different last name in the credits, and went on to do the Sanctuary series later. At least her acting improved over the decades, but sucks in this bit part she played. Like many people here said, the acting is bad, story is stupid, cgi is poor. For those of you that know anything about snakes, you'll laugh in spots from the bad writing of the script and lines knowing that whoever wrote this crap, has only seen a picture of a snake and clueless about them otherwise. Anaconda was far superior for the Giant Snake Monster eating people. By the way, 30 foot snakes do happen, some up to 50 feet have been documented, but not in at least 70 years. That may change with them in the tens of thousands in Everglades National Park. I've seen a few I wouldn't hunt without lots of help. Google ""Python Hunt 2016 Florida"". As of 2017, Florida is now hiring professional hunters to catch and kill Burmese Pythons. $8.32 hr,  $75 for a 4 foot python, then add $25 per foot over that. They do limit you to $6000. Budgets you know.",1500595200,,1679,4.451298701298701

Plot is choppy; acting is almost missing - the only ""actor"" in this movie is Dean Cain and that's too bad he picked this movie to be in!
The warden things he's got a leading role; the soldiers have no clue at all and their lines are so absurd (one guy radios in that he sees the boa and his commander tells him to keep moving rather than 'stay put we're on our way'; another soldier questions his commander telling him to push through in combo; they move aimlessly; etc...
