8251495,4,B0013K1AKK,This is not what Berkeley was like in the '60s. It is what one wishes it was like. A pleasant fantasy for those who like to romanticize the hippie years.,1466640000,,153,4.133333333333334
8251496,2,B0013K1AKK,"Trite, hardly captured anything about the real feel of Berkeley during the 60s/70s. Stereotyped hackneyed script,  acting. I lived in Berkeley during those times.",1447372800,,162,5.75

8251499,5,B0013K1AKK,"I was really happy to finally see a film that united the anti-war movements from Viet Nam and Iraq.  The music is stupendous.  Is the soundtrack available?

I think they should make a sequel and take these young, attractive characters into the seventies.",1215302400,2,254,4.8604651162790695
8251500,5,B0013K1AKK,"The music of Country Joe and The Fish and Tom Morello make this Bobby Roth movie a winner and must have DVD for all fans of both Country Joe and The Fish and of Tom Morello. There are 10 classic Country Joe and The Fish tracks on the film as well as several jams featuring Tom Morello and Nick Roth as Ben Sweet. ""Stars of Orion"" by Morello is featured in the film and that song was among the finalist's for an academy award nomination earlier this year.
The film is about a young boy Ben Sweet who finds himself at UC Berkeley in 1968 and is quickly caught up in the anti-war, free speech, dope and fast sex of the times. His dad played by non other than Henry Winkler is appalled by his sons behavior, but loves him non the less. Bonnie Bedelia plays a professor who encourages Ben  to become a writer.
Berkeley will hold up as a classic underground film about the 60's and the real music and sentiment of that time. Don't worry what the critics might say about this film. It is a must see and  and it is a historic statement about the turbulent 60's.",1213660800,6,1053,4.207920792079208
