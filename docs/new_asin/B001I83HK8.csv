8310506,4,B001I83HK8,"Dread Zeppelin is basically a group with ""Elvis singing"" Led Zeppelin and other similar songs.  The songs  often have a reggae beat so the song is not a ""karaoke"" version with a ""new singer.""  I own a couple of their cds and enjoy the ""new"" interpretations of music.  This DVD, is not, in my opinion, one of their best efforts. The audio is more like a bar band quality and the way they stage dress, is to say the least, possibly inappropriate. Still, it is a very interesting video!!!  Video quality is a step or two above VHS. The stand out  song is Stairway to Heaven.",1424217600,,571,4.339622641509434
