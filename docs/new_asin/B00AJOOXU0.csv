8552707,4,B00AJOOXU0,"Great DVD.  I have their earlier version on VHS and DVD done in the 80's.  No comparison.  I've followed their performances since 1958 and the quality of their dances haven't lost a beat.  I especially loved the Kalmuk dance which is quite different from most of their repertoire.  If you like Georgian dance, their dance company gave a performance a few years ago in Paris and is available on DVD from Amazon.",1435363200,,410,4.638888888888889
8552708,5,B00AJOOXU0,I watch RT America.  Three or four months ago they had a documentary about this ballet company.  I had never heard of them before.  Well I was blown away by that show and the people in it.  I wanted to see more.  So I ordered this DVD.  I was delighted with it. This DVD is something I will never get tired of if I listen to it a thousand times.  Like ACDC or Alice Cooper.  It is so beautiful.  I hum the songs while going about my daily chores. If you buy this DVD you will be happy with it.,1430870400,,493,3.85
8552709,5,B00AJOOXU0,"The ensemble never fails to amaze,whether live or on film. This generation is as wonderful as the many generations we were fortunate to see in person. Mr. Moisture was a genius in capturing not only the Russian folkloric character, but that of nations around the world. Colorful, technical virtuosity, finely tuned ensemble.",1428192000,2,324,5.25
