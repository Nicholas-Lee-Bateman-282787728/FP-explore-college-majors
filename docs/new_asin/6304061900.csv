768298,5,6304061900,"Amazing action in this movie with one of the best story lines/plots I have ever watched unfold! I have seen many martial art films and I rate this movie as the best one I have seen, because of the many traits the movie has for, like in  Hidden Dragon, this movie is also shown in english subtitles.  But, do not let that steer you away because the subtitles in this movie make it all the more better, for  dubed movies are a joke; one dubed movie I have seen, I never knew that an 18th centruy marital arts master could have a western/John Wayne acent!!  These poor dubs take away a great deal from the movie, while with subtitled movies you are able to hear the real emotion that is expresed in their voices, something that dubed versions take away.  Yet this is not the case in Snake Deadly Act, for it is run in original Cantonese with the english subtitles.  The story line in this movie is one of the best I have ever seen, I will not spoil it and tell you what happens but there is all sorts revenge, battles, trickery, and many twists and turns all through the 90 minutes of playing time!!  Have you ever been upset with poor camra angles durring a martial arts film, where all you see is maby an arm or a leg, well not in Snake Deadly Act, for it is run in WIDESCREEN, so durring the movie you will be able to see EVERYTHING!!
One problem is, sometimes, durring a few scenes of the movie it is a little difficult to read the subtitles, but this only happens a few times.  Snake Deadly Act is one of the best martial arts films round by all of the reasosn above.",988502400,,1569,4.206666666666667

7860177,2,6304061900,"This dvd version of Snake Deadly act, which features the same cover art features above, is NOT very good. It has (non-removable) subtitles in BOTH English and Chinese, while featuring an English overdub. This is the first Ground Zero dvd I've ever bought, due to the terrible overall ratings that I was previously aware of, and it will be the last one I purchase from made by this studio. Save your money and buy one from a higher quality mfg. company. No extras (not even subtitle options, yo!) whatsoever and the transfer version that is less-than-spectacular...look elsewhere for a dvd copy of this awesome film!",1439164800,,615,4.866666666666666
7860178,5,6304061900,"Old school Chinese martial arts demonstrates one of its favorite animal styles via Wilson Tong. If you liked Snake in the Monkey's Shadow starring John Change and Wilson Tong, you will find this pretty good as far as the martial arts goes. The story line focus on revenge and Tong's son being naive to the work his father does. This young man learns snake style from his father's enemy and doesn't even ask the guys name and trusts him just because he save his life. In real life sometimes people assist you with a negative motive in mind. Tong's son learns this the hard way, as he was in his own world most of the time (self assured, a large ego, and proud) ignoring the obvious!",1419033600,,681,4.412698412698413

7860181,4,6304061900,"Wilson Tong directs and stars along with Fung Hark On in this slight variation on the standard martial arts classic.  The film opens with a pretty sweet fight between the two leads as they argue about who defiled whose spouse and other assorted topics.  After the opening credits we forward several years to find Tong's son, Kuo (Kun Lung Ng, in his only starring role) pretending to be Dudley Do-Right and getting into trouble, when suddenly Fung Hark On shows up to save him and eventually instruct him in the deadly art of the Snake Fist.

Pretty sweet flick.  Plenty of fights with most of them pretty good, and a few of them very good.  It also has an interesting ending that I didn't quite see coming.  This even has a cameo from the great Bolo Yeung as a street performer, similar to his stint in the classic ""King Boxer"".  My only complaint (other than my obligatory gripes about editing) would be that the training scenes are too brief and rather monotonous.  I am a fan of animal styles and would like to see a more detailed portrayal.

Groundzero delivers a pretty good version of this DVD; that is if you ignore the erroneous information on the back cover.  The picture quality gets speckled in a few spots but mostly it's very good and in widescreen.  Granted it's hard to gauge just how widescreen when the opening credits list someone as the ""oducer"".  Though it is English dubbed, it has subtitles anyway, in case case you wanted to listen to baseball.  I had a difficult time deciding:  3.5 to 4.  Either way it's recommended.

7860183,3,6304061900,"SNAKE DEADLY ACT (1980) is an exciting kung fu film with several well-staged fights, some interesting characters, and a cast of kung fu favorites. Of chief interest is the casting of Fung Hak On, normally a villain, in the central role of a snake fist expert who waits a generation to get revenge on the monkey style expert, Kuo (Wilson Tong), who defeated him in the spectacular fight scene that opens the movie. Twenty years after that fight, he returns to the town where Kuo rules the roost and very gradually befriends Kuo's son (Ng Kwan Lung), a skilled fighter in his own right who, despite his privileges, uses his power to help the town's underdogs. Fung endeavors to teach the son snake fist (along with some ""drunken footwork"") and puts young Kuo through a series of grueling training exercises that are much more intense than normal for the genre. Fung keeps his ultimate agenda well-hidden until the very end.
With his beady eyes, bulging cheekbones and square jaw, Fung Hak On (sometimes billed as Feng Ko-An) boasted a powerful tough-guy presence reminiscent of such American action stars as Charles Bronson and Jack Palance. Fung normally played rather flamboyant kung fu bad guys (WARRIORS TWO, ENTER THE FAT DRAGON, MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER), but here he plays a more layered personality, someone who gains our sympathies early on and draws us into the story. Also in the cast are Angela Mao, as a shady brothel owner; Cheng Kang Yeh, as a hapless con man; Bolo Yeung, as a traveling strong man; and all-purpose villain Phillip Ko as Kuo's mysterious housekeeper.
The tape comes in a low-cost edition that, surprisingly, offers a letter-boxed transfer of a widescreen print in its original language, Cantonese, with English subtitles. It's rare to see an old-school kung fu movie in its proper widescreen dimensions and without the usual awkward English dubbing.",1041292800,2,1874,4.971337579617835
7860184,4,6304061900,"This movie begins with a fight. No words, no music. Just a great opening fight. That sets the tone for this Old School classic. Snake style & Eagle claw are spotlighted here. Good movie with a unexpected ending. A Must get if you like animal style movies. Subs are sometimes hard to read but who needs subs when its mostly fighting.",1005436800,2,332,4.459016393442623
