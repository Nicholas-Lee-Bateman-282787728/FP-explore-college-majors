6930533,3,B00RFSC9TA,Another teen scare fare. It was good though.,1428019200,2,44,4.625
6930534,2,B00RFSC9TA,Drawn out and not that great of acting,1426464000,,38,3.875
6930535,3,B00RFSC9TA,this movie wasn't scary one bit but it was sad in some parts,1426204800,4,60,3.6923076923076925
6930536,4,B00RFSC9TA,"I found myself surprisingly fascinated with this film. I thought it worked. I thought it flowed with ease and I really enjoyed the throwback to the 80s style of horror films. I think the movie works for a classic drive-in style film. A lower budget horror film. It has all the trademarks of an independent horror reality. I enjoyed the story. I thought it was different, fresh and original. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and I'm always looking for films that have that style, that ultra-class of the drive-in late night feature film and I have to say Treehouse does have that. I think even with its flaws, the movie works and for lovers of 80s horror and early 90s I believe they will take to this.

I think what ultimately stands out the most is the acting. Dana Melanie is fantastic and might I add stunningly beautiful as the character Elizabeth. I felt her role and she made me believe. J. Michael Trautmann is the shining star of the film. I think he aces the plight and emotional reality of the character of Killian. Trautmann is a wonderful actor I have been diligently following through his career. I sense a great performer in everything he does.

Like I say if you go into this wanting a great throwback to the 80s style independent horror and a drive-in feature film reality mixed with some great acting and an interesting plot, that I had no idea where it was going and ended up doing a 360 in the end; then you will be given a treat. Solidly entertaining.

I liked how the movie twisted and turned into something odd. At first I thought creatures, monsters maybe aliens and then it changed again adding something truly weird that made it all the more of an 80's throwback.

Think if Just Before Dawn (1981) Wrong Turn (2003) and Signs (2002) had an incestuous orgy and birthed a love child, it would be Treehouse.

6930537,3,B00RFSC9TA,"Quite disappointed - especially for the price. For $7.99 (as of this writing, you should be able to own this microbudget c-horror movie.

No thrill, chills, or scares. In fact, this one is actually not what I'd call horror. It's much more a supernatural thriller - without the thrills. It almost borders on a dark fairy tale, actually.

The trailer and DVD artwork are quite effective at marketing a film that, only after plunking down the price of a ticket, turns out to be just another misleadingly dull ride on the boring train...

On a positive note, though, the cinematography was notably, surprisingly good. Also, the acting was generally better than most microbudget supernatural thriller videos youll come across.

Oh, and the ending will leave you quite frustrated and the story incomplete.

My advice? Wait for this one to come out on Amazon Prime or Netflix. Better yet: save your money and rent TWO good b-horror films, like Mockingbird, Atticus Institute, Exists, The Houses October Built, etc.",1425513600,22,1007,5.005988023952096

6930539,3,B00RFSC9TA,"I was pleasantly surprised as the movie got started. It was very suspenseful. The acting and cinematography were good. All of which I was not expecting.  You will be disappointed if you're looking for a horror movie. This one is more like a suspense thriller. There is nothing supernatural or other worldly about it. That was a little disappointing. And the end sort of fell short. Over all, it was a pretty good movie.",1489795200,2,419,4.662162162162162

If I can predict 5, 10, 30 minutes, even an hour beforehand what is going to happen, that is a poorly written movie. And it happened multiple times. Clich after clich after clich after predictable after predictable after predictable. These guys did a really good job...at making the worst movie I've seen in a while.

6930590,2,B00RFSC9TA,"I saw this moving via Amazon streaming video.  The synopsis (summary/description) is misleading.

The story itself is not that bad in that it does have at least some originality.  However, the ending itself is one that leaves the viewer annoyed.  We pay for a story, not for half a story.  If you have a richer than rich imagination and like to be left hanging - with half of the story yet to be told, then this is the movie for you.

Treehouse is about a group of 3 brothers kidnapping a young boy (sound familiar yet?), his sister comes homes and finds him gone, goes looking for him in the woods and gets starnded UP IN A TREEHOUSE!!! (sound familiar? just substaute treehouse for rangers station!), they get stuck in said treehouse and the worst the bad guys cand do IS THROW STONES!! Well APARENTLY only one of the 3 brothers can climb trees, BUT HE DOESN'T CLIMB UP THE TREE TO KIDNAP OF KILL THEM!!
When they hang the guys friends in the trees original BUT kinda lame cause you can see they are wearing harnesses (look at the girl in the farthest tree, the ""nose"" isn't even around her neck! It looks to be around her armpits!)... Well the girl having hypoglycemia and going into a coma like state then waking up, actually real (it's almost happened to me a few times!), BUT she wouldn't wake up that fast and be able to run or move around. I DID like how the little brother finally got brave and actaully DID something near the end of the movie! AWESOME! BUT STILL VERY CLOSE TO WRONG TURN! Even the cabin in the woods but this one was actaully nice looking and the brothers didn't seem to be canibals.
The ending is like WTH? So they FINALLY get outa the woods and the first car that comes along is a police truck with all the weapons they need to HUNT DOWN THAT ONE LAST DUDE?
ONE LAS THING: If the girl's feet were hurt as bad as they made them out to be HOW COULD SHE HAVE WALKED  BACK INTO THE WOODS? She just srolled on in there like her feet were all better instead of running on them for a few movie ""hours""....

The movie is perfectly paced and developed (maybe too slow for the 'Chainsaw' crowd, but OK for me), and the acting, filming and script are just fine for a movie like this.

Its not classic cinema but for what it was more movies fail where this one succeeded.  Not a waste of time and a treat if your into this kind of flick.  But previous reviewer said the synopsis was misleading and I agree thank god,  it was so much better than the synopsis.",1449273600,,430,4.182926829268292
6930755,2,B00RFSC9TA,"Didn't like it at all, but didn't hate it. The acting is sub-par at best. There is really no significant story to the movie, whereas at some points they actually make you think that they'll be going somewhere with something, only to drop off, unfinished on to the next scene. None of the characters are endearing, so any loss in the movie (which is minimal and not graphic at all) is irrelevant, you really don't care. You're lead to believe it is a mysterious creature or demon killing people in the woods, when in fact it's just 3 woods dwelling psychopaths. VERY disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it, unless there's absolutely nothing else to watch at any given time.",1449187200,,672,4.703389830508475

The video looks amazing, nothing cheap about it. The acting from the two lead actors was beyond great, and the other smaller parts were good too! Now, here comes the spoilers. For over an hour, I was lead to believe that there was some kind of supernatural, scifi creatures behind all of the killings and torture but in the end it turns out to just be three back-woods, deranged punks who can apparently live through a knife being thrown into their chest. The kids finally find their way to a road after escaping the trio and cause a car to crash. Instead of checking if the driver (who is assumed to be some police officer due to the gun and evidence bagged in the trunk) had a cell phone or any radio for help, the kids decide to take it into their own hands and go back into the woods and find the last of the trio.

I'm actually not a huge fan of teens in scary movies, but the two main characters were well-written to avoid the annoying cockiness and stupidity that plagues their age group. Unfortunately, most of the ""scary"" bits of the film are in the trailer, so you won't be shocked when you see them again. As for the complaints about the ending, if you're the type that needs everything to happen on screen and slowly explained you in order to have a sense of finality, then no, you won't like the end.

The two events come together as our boys find Elizabeth in the DVD cover and must formulate a plan against whatever it is that is out there. Killian is bothered by pain, anxiety, and flashbacks. Not to show my age, but Killian reminded me of ""Tommy"" in the 1979 Kenny Rogers tune, COWARD OF THE COUNTY.

The film built nicely and then slowed up in the Treehouse, which didn't last long. When we finally figure out what is gong on, it was anti-climatic.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Dana Melanie did a heck of a job for a ""B"" role. Kudos.

And there were even allusions to what should have been supernatural activity in any other movie, but here it just lends to inconsistencies as to the nature of the menace, which is incredibly frustrating. I felt like the writer and director purposely misled the audience to try to be clever and throw us a curve, but it just didn't work.

However, I do give props for good cinematography, which lent to a few genuinely creepy and disturbing moments. The actors are fine and do the best they can with the material they're given, but holy crap, was the ending cheesy as hell.

- Ghosts
- Demons
- Smiegel-like genetic experiments running around the woods killing people.
- Any lycanthropes whatsoever.  None.  No werewolves, werebears, wererabbits, or briar patches will be shown.
- Vampires, shimmering or otherwise
- Democrats
- Republicans
- Nazis
- 70's pornstars

This isn't that kinda movie.  What you will get plenty of is crazies.  All kinda crazies doing all kinda crazy stuff.  Cuz they're crazies, and that's what they do.

Now, that having been said, the ending of this movie for me made all other points moot.  SPOILER ALERT:  Yeah I'm about to spoil to crap out of it.  Normally in the movies I like at the end there's some huge reveal.  The wolves storming the church in Dark was the Night.  The brother cutting the cameraman's throat in The Last Posession.  Rarely do you see the 'victims' in a film at the very end of the movie arming up and heading BACK into whatever hellish place they just got out of.  This is one of those movies.  You don't see how it goes, you don't see how they do, but the two survivors, him with an M-16/M-4 (NOT an AR-15) and her with a beautiful FN-FAL, heading back in to administer some hot, sticky justice all over their oppressors filthy cornholes, as they rightly deserve.

6931078,2,B00RFSC9TA,"It said there would unimaginable horror.

The horror was quite imaginable. And dull.

To be sure, this is NOT a horror movie. It has violent elements, but it's not a horror flick.

The movie does try to be something admirable--a literary tale of an introverted kid set in a gritty, real-world scenario. Unfortunately it fails. But it didn't have to fail. It's almost as if the makers of the film had to step in about every 10 minutes to do something stupid on purpose. The young actors were pretty good, but it's that injection of Stupid every so often that ruins the movie.

The dialogue is really inconsistent. One minute it's realistic and you're drawn in, the next minute, it's wooden and cliche. Eventually the movie devolves into a revenge kind of thing via found weapons.

Whoever controlled the storyline in this movie should never work in film again.",1437091200,2,859,4.738255033557047

It's not a spooky movie, it's more like the film ""The Hills Have Eyes"" as far as the tale is concerned.  It is a teen type movie with very little swearing, no drug use and no real sex scenes.  It has a ""bogyman"" type theme running throughout the film with some very real psycho killers throw in.  It was the kind of movie I let my kids watch when they were younger (of course I also took them to the show to see the ""Nightmare on Elm Street as well as ""Hell Raiser"" by Clive Barker).

I gave it four stars.  Really good movie for kids to watch, since the main characters overcame the ""bogyman"" and that made for an upbeat ending.",1436659200,2,736,4.170212765957447

6931089,4,B00RFSC9TA,"Prior to watching Treehouse I ended up reading what were seemingly universal negative reviews of this movie. Now that the movie is over I would find myself wondering if these people were watching an entirely different movie if it hadn't been for specific plot points that they referenced.
Sure, there have been better suspense/horror movies made, but there wasn't anything particularly wrong with this one.
The story takes place in the Ozark mountain region and when the movie starts off, children and young adults have apparently been going missing for a little while. It begins with a fairly tense and interesting segment regarding one of these instances of people going missing before the title sequence comes up.
There will be a bit of a spoiler here, though not much of one. There seems to be some misapprehension with people who had reviewed this before because they seem to be under the impression that there was some sort of inhuman creature (or creatures) out in the woods where the titular treehouse is located, when it was more than obvious to me that these were nothing more than people, even having a totally human shape when all we are exposed to are silhouettes and shadows initially. Like movies along the lines of Wrong Turn and The Hills Have Eyes, the monsters in this movie are human beings, depraved as they might be.
One of the other major complaints I read about was the rapid connection developed between two of the characters, to the point that the girl begins referring to the boy with a bit of a pet name after they had spent the night in hiding. Clearly, these individuals had never been made aware of the fact that high stress, frightening, and life threatening situations have a tendency to cause people to develop an intense emotional bond with others who are in the same position. There was nothing bizarre or ludicrous about that use of a pet name in the least.
Finally, the other big complaint was about the ending, leaving a final little piece of the story open-ended, not for a potential sequel, but simply because there was no reason to film it. That is a common thing, in movies and in literature, to complete the climax and then have a final scene in which our heroes head off to finish the last little bit of what needs to be done, without following them on that last stretch of the journey, allowing us to fill it in for ourselves and enjoy a tiny little shred of mystery regarding what happens.
I can only assume that the people who watched this movie before me (and complained about these aspects of it in the clearly oblivious manner they exhibited) are either stupid or not altogether familiar with movies in general.
The score was good and helped to enhance the atmosphere of the story, and the same could be said for the camera work and overall direction. The acting was better than par for a relatively unknown, low budget horror flick. The story was good, though not perfect, and it was more than coherent enough to keep my interest.",1431734400,17,2982,4.671102661596958
6931090,3,B00RFSC9TA,"Treehouse is a solid film where the drama and character development are concerned. The cast give mature, well acted scenes of heavy substance, and depth. The horror aspects are mostly off camera with very little moments of chilling terror taking place through the first 75 minutes of the film which is a bit of a let down. However the film does have some intense, chilling action that climaxes this nightmare scenario, lasting right up until the abrupt and irritating end. Yeah I know- total spoiler moment.

The special effects, settings and sounds in Treehouse all work for the horror elements in the film. Everything that happens gives more of an adult horror vibe, instead of the teen driven story that is actually presented. Think Under The Bed in heavy seriousness but without the actual horror for most of the film. I know I keep bringing that issue up but it is a big irritant for me, personally. Still the film has been getting some great reviews mixed in with some disappointing ones. The effects are great when displayed, real quality work. The last act is terrifying when the true horror of the situation is revealed. Disturbing to say the least.

Overall, Treehouse gives good story, but mostly on the side of  say if- Lifetime has an R- rated channel where the films had darker material and stronger gory violence. When the horror is there it brings it! Unfortunately the first 75 minutes is mostly drama with suspense and no release for die-hard horror fans. It is a noticeable loss even with a story this well written and delivered. Plus that WTF ending is just so rude and disappointing that you sort of fill pissed.",1431216000,2,1633,4.742957746478873

I'm with so many others... It was great right up until the end. It was like the decided to go from revenge to Bonnie & Clyde light. Besides the glaring fact that given all of the glaring and very solid evidence no jury in the world would have locked them up for going back for the last one, even if they did believe they were out of danger. They gutted her baby brother and burned his older brother alive, and with the photographic evidence of their other crimes her account of attempted rape would not have even been questioned.

Some questions were left too. Apparently this had not been going on long, so was Mama keeping her little psychopaths in line or was this a lifestyle and she just made sure they stuck to victims no one would miss and they went off the rails after she died? In any case there is no way that no one was aware of their existence/residence with the setup they had. Also, why wouldn't they go in the treehouse, or at least the little one? What happened to their father? Dad wasn't in the photos so did Mom keep them in the woods because of the stigma of having illegitimate kids in her generation, the stigma of mental handicaps, or both? What exactly happened to Killian and Crawford's parents? It sounded like their mom had some kind of breakdown so did their dad or his death cause it or did she possibly kill him?

8695296,4,B00RFSC9TA,"I actually liked it in spite of all the flaws. Yes, the evil forces turn out to be human, so if you're looking for supernatural horror, keep scrolling. This is a weird little coming of age film, that also celebrates the rough love between siblings, and how it can be good or bad. Elizabeth comes home and finds her house ransacked and her six year old brother missing. She's does what any teenage southern belle would do, grabs her father's rifle and chases after the kidnappers into the woods. Neither is seen again. Since this is not the first time kids have gone missing recently, the town cancels the fall festival fireworks, prompting Crawford to take his younger brother Killian into the woods for their own fireworks display. (Because what harm could a little pyrotechnics do to a dry forest with piles of dead leaves everywhere, right???) They find Elizabeth hiding in a tree house that is at the top of an insanely tall tree. Why anyone would build a tree house fifty feet up miles from anywhere (and then haul a rocking chair up there!) is a mystery, but it has a rickety railing made of twigs, so we know its safe. And good thing too, because Elizabeth is hurt and can't walk. So Crawford, as always, sticks his neck out for Killian and goes to get help. Which, as always, is the absolute worst thing he could have done because now their little band is separated and the bad guys have them surrounded. Killian wisely decides that this is NOT a good day to die, so he very consciously grows up overnight. What follows is somewhat formulaic, but also very different than most survival films. The vast majority of violence is off screen, which is somehow worse. We can only imagine what the final screams must have sounded like when we see what's left of the bodies, and so we do. The teens are driven by love for their bothers more than fear for themselves. They don't make stupid choices, no one falls down running, and not one person runs up the stairs instead of out the front door (my personal pet peeve.) But in spite of doing everything right, they realize they have already lost their most important battle so they settle for very deliberately evening the score, knowing full well what it could cost them all. The acting was good, there was enough humor to keep it from wallowing in the depths of despair, and I might be in the minority, but I got a kick out of the twist at the very end.",1500768000,2,2404,4.4908675799086755
