8431387,5,B004IZ74JI,"I remember watching the tv show on PBS, and really enjoyed every episode. The actors were fresh and funny. A Mature Lawyer, meets a young school teacher and a romance builds. The Mature Lawyer has a woman chaser for a law partner, and daffy responest that types, and screws messages up all the time. The Lawyer has a Photo of Perry Mason in his office for moral support. Now, add in his Son, who is as old as the young School Teacher. His Son can't decide if he wants to be a Lawyer (Solicitor) like his Dad. Next his Daughter thinks he is silly dating the younger woman. It is great British Humor at its best.",1519948800,,610,4.267241379310345

not available in the U.S. or anywhere! They must
know that its popular or they wouldn't continue to
show it in re-runs. Put it on DVD---PLEASE!!!!",1376006400,14,195,4.764705882352941

I really loved this series and it deserves 5 stars for sure, but it's never been available on DVD in the U.S. I can't think why not. I wish the powers that be would get on the stick!",1355097600,23,263,3.981132075471698
