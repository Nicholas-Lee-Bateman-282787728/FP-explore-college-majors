2304562,5,B0009NZ2Z6,"Season 3 of Def Poetry Jam is my favorite thus far.  The guest poets are great !!  Smokey Robinson really surprised me with his poem and the message he sends to everyone is nothing less than the truth.  Jill Scott also does an awesome job ...!!  I highly recommend all three seasons because Def Poetry is something you can watch over and over and over ... it's NEVER a boring moment ... and you can LEARN a lot !!

2304563,4,B0009NZ2Z6,"They did some great casting with this one! This is one for the collection!

Poetri killed me with the piece on Krispy Kreme. Whoa!

Black Ice, Ursula Rucker (she is the chick at the end of all The Roots records spittin' venom).

Philly poets have it on smash!! Need I say more.

Ohh and the Philly rapper Rosco P. Coldchain! Wow! He blew me away! If he doesn't make you understand ghetto life, you'll never get it. He broke it down!

Mums! That guy is a problem! He brings the same energy he gives you on OZ to the stage. Raw!

Flaco Navaja, what a beast. Nothing like a passionate Latin with crazy verbal skillz!

Too many others to go into. Definitely a great buy.",1134432000,5,666,4.28
2304564,5,B0009NZ2Z6,"I own the first two dvds already.  I really enjoyed the third.  You will begin to notice the poets who are staples for the show.  Beau Sia is always live.  Black Ice is always great.  Lemon brings the flavor.  Suheir is always thought provoking and life changing.  Keep up the good work.  Also, buy the Def Poetry On Broadway book for more.

Love it.",1130198400,2,350,4.34375
2304565,5,B0009NZ2Z6,"This was one of the best seasons yet. Common, big ups for that man and many others. God bless these poets when they amaze us. Please purchase this DVD creative minds!!!!!!!!",1128816000,,173,4.612903225806452
2304566,4,B0009NZ2Z6,"Def Poetry Jam is on fire with season 3.  From the first poet to the last your attention is fixed directly on that stage listening to words cleverly crafted to get you thinking.  Mos Def does an excellent job hosting, and occassionally dropping a couple of verses on the crowd forever capturing their attention span.  Russell Simmons has done it again.  The only thing I want to know is.......when is season 4 dropping?",1124323200,3,419,4.698630136986301
