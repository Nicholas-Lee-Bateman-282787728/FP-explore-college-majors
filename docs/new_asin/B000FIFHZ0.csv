2566967,2,B000FIFHZ0,"I bought this DVD to show to my world history class. I was very disappointed when I opened it up and saw that there is no DVD menu (it just starts playing as soon as you put it in) and that there are only 4 or 5 chapters, which are set up sloppily (like in the middle of people's sentences). The result is that it is difficult use this DVD as an instructional tool. The first part gives a history of the Armenian people and their persecution in the Ottoman Empire. It is a little dry, but it may be suitable for older students (I teach tenth grade). The explanation of the events that caused the genocide is well done, as is the documentation of the genocide itself. The rest of the movie talks about the politics of remembering/forgetting the genocide, and is pretty good. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of student-friendly resources about the genocide (my students' textbooks don't even mention it), so teachers are put in the situaton of using so/so resources to teach about an important subject. If I can find a better DVD I will definitely buy it for next time. All-in-all, I am angry that the DVD's presentation is of such a poor quality. I would have expected more from PBS.",1164758400,30,1185,4.465437788018433

2567001,5,B000FIFHZ0,"This is no joke people, this was the first genocide of the 20th century!  Hitler even asked rhetorically as he was about to invade Poland, ""Who today remembers the annihilation of the Armenians?""  This movie was heartbreaking to watch and I've watched it over three times to get a closer look at it and see if I could ever side with the Turks again.  Simple answer...no!  What happened to the Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks was horrible and a crime against humanity.  There is still pain going on within the Armenian community, they're wondering why their own conquerors turned their back on them and tried to drive them to extinction!  Now I understand why the Greeks hate the Turks, I've heard many jokes about how blood-thirsty Turks were in movies, and why the cinema has depicted them as being evil, unfeeling things!  My point being that if you're going to cover the truth up, it better not being a huge mess like the Armenian Genocide, people are going to find out eventually, they always do!

Here is some excuses that Turks will make up...which I'm now going to debunk.

1) There was no genocide!

A:  Yes there was a genocide, they have proven it in this video!  My dad even said it happened after he watched it!  My grandparents told me there was a genocide against the Armenians, my Russian tutor who happens to be married to a Muslim from Iran told me it happened!  My best friend in the world watched this with me and he cried for hours because he felt so sorry for those Armenians!  In fact the Turkish Government wastes too much money trying to cover this genocide up!

2) Its an insult to Turkish Pride and Islam!

A:  Don't fall for it, they even tell Muslim Pakistanis that they're an insult to Turkish Pride whenever they read about the Armenian Genocide (which is very little).  They'll tell the same thing to Arabs, other muslims and Kurds!  Remember that this did not happen because of Islam, Islam only was used as an excuse along with ""Turkish Pride"" to commit these horrible atrocities.

3) What about the millions of Turks that died by Armenian hands?

A: Actually in all honesty it was the Eastern Armenians (Russian Armenians) that killed the majority of Turks, not Western Armenians (Ottoman Armenians), in fact I've only known a little number of Western Armenians to murder Turks, in self defense that is.

4) A bunch of rebel groups killed innocent millions of Turkish civilians.

A: How wrong is that?  I don't recall once about women and children being a part of these ""rebel groups"" which happened to be mostly in the Turkish imagination.

5)  It was a civil war that caused all this trouble, along with ethnic dispute!

A:  Civil War my behind!  This was created by the Turkish Government to get people to act hostile towards non-Turks!

6)  The women and children were being relocated to remote villages and will return!

A: Most of them never returned or knew what fate awaited them!  Also consider the fact that they drove these caravans filled with pregnant women, children, young women, along with old people out into the desert and nowhere near remote villages.  They fed them no food, they let them starve to death and they also pushed them off of cliffs and into the sea!  So if you ask me they lied to these people and did nothing to stop them from dying!  I'm pretty sure that 1.5 million Armenians did not dye by accident!

7) The survivors are liars!

A: No they're not!  I'm pretty sure if I saw my aunt and mom get slaughtered right in front of me, I too would remember a gruesome detail like that.

There are plenty of more myths I have to debunk, but have no time to do, so I think that everyone should know about the genocide regardless if it gets recognized by USA or not.  This is just wrong and it needs to be talked about no matter how long ago it happened!",1293840000,10,3815,4.541850220264317
2567002,5,B000FIFHZ0,"I have watched this documentary several times.  What is striking to me, and what I specifically looked for in it, is corroboration of the Armenian Genocide by third parties, by definition, not Armenians and not Turks.  We see quoted in this documentary confirmation from the Germans and the Americans (even the New York Times) at the time of the genocide that the genocide did indeed occur, that it was orchestrated at the highest levels of the ""Young Turk"" regime.  This documentary does cover the history of Ottoman Armenian rebellion and separatist movement, and that those Armenians did kill Turks.  But whatever debate you want to have about this rebellion, nothing justifies genocide.

Nothing justifies genocide.  Nothing.  It is documented fact that the Armenian genocide occurred as told by multiple foreign (ie, non-Armenian, non-Turkish) observers.  There is no ""other side"", just like there is no ""other side"" rebutting the Jewish Holocaust, or for that matter the genocide practiced by the US Government in systematically destroying Native Americans.  It happened.  It is well documented.

Even if a few Armenian guerrillas were helping the Russians, even if the Ottoman Armenians had no legitimate claim to independence from the Ottoman empire, none of it justifies the Ottomans documented, systematic murder of 1,000,000 Armenian civilians or their stealing Armenian property from cleansed towns and villages.

What I don't understand is the bitter defensiveness of modern day Turks (ie, post 1923) for the war crimes committed by a Turkish regime that the new Turkish government repudiated back in 1923!

I say to the Turkish deniers on this site: why do you feel that you have to defend the Turks of an era repudiated by your own 1923 Turkish government itself?  I don't get it.  The Turks of 1915 are not you!  You owe them no loyalty.

As an American citizen whose ancestors go back to the founding of America, I repudiate my own ancestors who were slave holders and who committed genocide against the Native Americans.  I owe them no loyalty or defense. It's that simple. Those American settlers did not have to integrate themselves through genocide.  You modern day Turks must do the same with respect to the crimes committed by your ancestors.",1269734400,45,2265,5.105978260869565
2567003,3,B000FIFHZ0,"Mr. Goldberg's documentary is one sided, based on information provided by those with hatred against the Turks who ignore the Armenian rebellions and revolts accross the Eastern Anatolia and the massacre of Turks that forced the Ottoman Government to re-locate the Armenians to other parts of the empire. I would recommend Amazon.com to make available a documentary ''Armenian Revolt'' directed by Marty Callaghan with Professor Secil Karal Akgun, Aram Arkun, David Fromkin. ""This in-depth documentary is based on two years of research using various Authenticated National Archives documents from: United-States, England, Russia, Germany, Romania, and Bulgaria, and with historical footage and images from national archives with the participation of an international team of experts."" The film provides ""a balanced view"" of the struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the Armenians in Eastern Anatolia who rebelled against their own government to create a state of their own on lands where they were never the majority.... This is a film about the conflict between the Turks and the Armenians which was started by the Armenians.",1257379200,8,1127,5.520231213872832
2567004,5,B000FIFHZ0,Everyone must see this DVD. You will be surprised as to what goes on in history and current life.,1248998400,8,97,4.157894736842105
2567005,4,B000FIFHZ0,"I have no ties to either the Armenian or Turkish community.

This was an excellent film, but it shouldn't be the last stop in someone's investigation of the genocide that occurred in 1915.  Rather, it's an excellent beginning, because it presents the issue comprehensively, and raises questions for further investigation.

The film does an outstanding job of portraying the human suffering caused by the genocide.  Using photos from the time (some are quite graphic, be forewarned), plus written accounts (including from American diplomatic officials throughout the territory where the genocide occurred), it convincingly portrays the cruelty and barbarity perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks against the civilian population.  Clearly, something horrible was perpetrated by the Ottoman government against approximately 1,000,000 ethnic Armenians, subjects of that Ottoman government.

It suffers slightly in trying to explain ""why"" it happened, and in convincing the viewer that the slaughter meets the modern-day definition of ""genocide.""  ([...])

I say it fails because it does not attempt to address any of modern-day Turkey's rebuttals to the accusations leveled against it by the world community.  It does not address in any detail supposed collaboration by Armenians with Russian forces by the ethnic Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire (note, the Armenians were just a long-persecuted ethnic group member of the Empire -- 100's of thousands were killed by Ottomans in the late 1800's, as well), nor does it address Enver's insane, foolhardy campaign against Russia in the Caucasus earlier.

(Editorial comment: even IF a few Armenian guerillas were helping the Russians, does it give the Ottomans the right:  1.) to murder 1,000,000 civilians 2.) to kill elderly, women, and children with extreme brutality 3.) to steal Armenian property from cleansed towns and villages 4.) to engage in a systematic campaign of eliminating ethnic Armenians from Anatolia?)

It must be noted, the makers of the film gave the government of Turkey a chance to present its side of the story, but the Government chose not to participate.  The footage in the film of the Turkish Ambassador to the U.S. before the U.S. Congress in 1990 is quite damaging to the Turkish case, as is a cold, heartless interview with an official Turkish historian, who notes that the drama of 1915 can cause someone to cry, but it has no significance beyond that.

It is also chilling to see what has happened to some Turks who have spoken out, and shared their belief that the Turkish government of that time did commit genocide.

(Note, in 1923, Ataturk became the dictator/leader of Turkey, and essentially created the modern-day Turkish state through control of the military and overpowering will -- an officially secular, modern state.  Ataturk had some problematic issues, but he is truly a historical legend, and a major figure.  From 1923, Turkey and its government bore little resemblence to the government of 1915 -- an empire in its death throes, governed by a weak Sultan, challenged by a radical, nationalist, and foolhardy triumvirate of ""Young Turks.""  I think this is part of the reason why it's so hard for modern-day Turkey to admit to the genocide; the state today is radically different from the state of that time.

I'll also add some relativism: just as it's hard for us modern-day Americans to accept that ""we"" committed genocide against the Native American population of America, and such genocide would never occur in today's world, I believe that it is difficult for modern-day Turks to do the same, vis-a-vis the Armenian genocide.)

All in all, a quality film, and a worthy addition to the canon of work exploring the tragic events of 1915.",1235174400,36,3737,5.186356073211314
2567006,5,B000FIFHZ0,"I admit that I am new to the subject of the Armenian genocide. That being said, this was a great introduction. The film guides the viewer through the horrific holocaust of the Armenian people living in Turkey and describes many of the horrors they were subjected to.
It seems that there is some contraversy as to the reality of the genocide. Whether or not there really was a genocide (I whole heartedly believe there was) this film is still worth your time. The film may not go into some aspects of the Ottoman empires reason for killing of hapless Armenians, but it does touch on some reasons that they had for the unconscionable move.
Nevertheless, I give the film high marks and would encourage others to watch it. It's worth your time.",1235088000,8,740,4.613636363636363
2567007,1,B000FIFHZ0,"Armenians, Jews, Kurdish and people from different cultures live in Turkey. Children and women are being killed in Gazze now by bombs. Hundred thousands of people have been killed in Bosnia. We have all seen movies made about the Nazis so what does it change? Nobody forgets anything but if you don't forgive mutually battles will never end. Armenians kidnapped and killed my grandfather's uncle torturing him when he was only a little child. During the First World War English used Greek, French used Armenians and Kurdish to colonise different parts of Turkey. Kurdish still kill Turkish people because they think the East and Southeast belongs to them. The Armenian terrorist group ASALA killed Turkish innocent people in the past. After ASALA vanished PKK came out. These are all planned agitations to weaken the Middle East(divide and rule). Plus millions of Armenians never lived in that region if you knew geography you would know why. If i were a history teacher i would watch the DVD before showing it to students and would prefer recent genocides still going on.

2567028,1,B000FIFHZ0,"This documentary is a disgrace to history, not only does it distort history by immediately giving you the director's biased conclusion from the very beginning but it does nothing to promote history. It simply details stories of death that does not prove genocide: think about it, if I made a documentary on World War II and only put in videos of how American soldiers killed Germans, it would SEEM like as if America committed genocide---this is not scholarly work, you must present BOTH SIDES to be objective!

Even Western historians have condemned this documentary, because it is completely based on one single perspective, and the only objection they allow for the other side to make their case is about one sentence throughout the documentary.

In addition there are direct lies in the documentary. For example, they interviewed ""witnesses"" that they call ""Turkish witnesses"", but yet they are speaking KURDISH and are not Turkish. That was a direct lie that this documentary showed us. How dare they mislead the public using propaganda and deceit?

Just as there are those who, amazingly, seek to deny the Holocaust, there are even more subtle and vicious voices seeking to deny the Armenian Genocide committed by the Turks during World War I. This systematic murder, forced starvation, rape, and torture of more than a million Armenians introduced into the American language the phrase ""starving Armenians,"" but modern understanding of the origin of that phrase is lacking.

What the Armenian Genocide does not tell you is that the Armenians started revolting and murdered over 500,000 thousand Turks to begin with.  Further, the statistics used in the program are bogus.  Even according to Armenian Sources there were not 2 million Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire during that period.  Further, at the end of World War 1 the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist and the British controlled the former Ottoman Capital of Istanbul.  They conducted a witch hunt, they arrested 144 Ottoman Officials of the leadership including the then eqivulant to the prime minister and conveyed them to their island colony of Malta.  After two and a half years of exhuastive inquiries they could not find any evidence whatsoever to charge any of them let alone convict.  All 144 Ottoman Officials were released and allowed to return home.  Further the investigator Lord Curzon (well known for his hatred of Turks) asked the US Government of the day to provide any evidence they may have had in their possession.  An answer came back that the US did not have any evidence with which to use against the Ottoman leadership.

What the Armenian Diaspora could not achieve via armed conflict and legal means is now trying to achieve politically and by using propaganda like this particular documentary.  There is always two sides to every story and the Armenians will not allow the Turks to put theirs forward.
