8022407,5,B00025C37Q,"This is a nice, balanced workout with separate toning and yoga sections.  The toning section is mostly upper body work in which hand weights are used; the the yoga section consists of traditional moves which focus on your lower body (""warrior"", etc.)  The ""no-nonsense"" instructor does the voice-over for the weight section, while the ""meditative"" instructor does the same for the yoga section.  The overall effect is both relaxing yet effective.",1145404800,,446,5.253521126760563
8022408,5,B00025C37Q,"I am just starting out in Yoga, so I needed a tape that had specific instructions to help me get the most out of the workout.  This DVD did the trick!  I wasn't frustrated by the DVD, so I actually did the workout more than once.  (My closet is FULL of DVD's I've done once - and chucked!)  This may be the very last DVD I have to buy - it works fabulous for me!",1113609600,,362,3.7866666666666666
8022409,5,B00025C37Q,"I started using Yogalift after trying it out at a friends house. What I love about this program is that there are 4 different levels of difficulty displayed for each exercise. I can choose to go easy on one exercise and step it up for the next, I'm not tied down to a particular form or technique-there are a number of techniques I get to choose from for every exercise. I also like how this isn't a fad workout, but actually just using your own body weight and strength to tone youself into a healthier body. Only takes 20min, 3 times a week to get results, and when working full time that is all the time I've got. Great program, I highly recommend it.",1105056000,,654,4.282258064516129

8022411,5,B00025C37Q,"YogaLift is like no other workout I've ever tried before.  The combination of yoga and weights really makes for quick results.  Most importantly, the video is fun and easy.  YogaLift is truly a workout video that anyone can use.  I love it.",1083542400,,240,4.642857142857143
