5036562,3,B006XDU80A,"I liked season one for it's goofyness combined with heart, even though fan service seems to be the core reason shows like this even exist at all. But the characters are cute & loveable, and the show was funny without ever getting too raunchy. I rooted for Rito to hook up with the girl he adores, Haruna (who also has a secret crush on him).

I saw this follow up season over the web on fansub videos. This season apparaantly is more closer to the manga (I have never read), which is more racey on the fan service side. Because it was a TV show that didn't look like it was made for TV, there was a lot of white glare filling the screen every other scene. The show was not nearly as endearing as the first season where there was some character devolopment, as this is a bunch of short skits (2-3 per half hour episode) with a lot of fan service, and no overall character development or story. If you enjoy fan service shows, this would be a very good one if released without the post production Japanese TV censorship. If that remains on this release, I can't see that it would appeal to very many as it does not stand up on it's own without the fan service, and on the other hand all those T&A gags look lame with the ""holy white glare"" appearing every time to cover it up.",1329177600,8,1274,4.221311475409836

5036566,5,B006XDU80A,It'sthe third season or 2 1/2 and I was suprised that I liked the new format. Can't wait to buy Darkness.,1370390400,,105,4.0476190476190474
5036567,3,B006XDU80A,"It was a good story, fast start but then slows down... A Lot. There is medium fan service and sometimes the rating is a wrong and it needs to be higher but over all it was fine. ^_^",1369353600,,181,3.789473684210526
5036568,5,B006XDU80A,"This complete collection is a great buy. Love the series. The DVDs are well placed into the case. No damage to the product. Cover art on both the case and the discs are nice to look at. 12 episodes. Only in Japanese, includes English subtitles. This set also features textless opening and ending.

The series is the second of the Anime. If you are a fan of comedy, aliens, hot springs, and bathtubs, Motto To Love Ru has all of that and more.",1366502400,,442,4.325301204819277
5036569,5,B006XDU80A,"If you like harem anime where essentially every girl in the story falls in love with the main character, which I believe is the best harem anime, then this is a great pick.",1365292800,,172,4.242424242424242
5036570,5,B006XDU80A,"To Love Ru it's one of my favorite series it's so funny  I love the manga which of course it's much better, the quality of the animation it's perfect, well I would prefer it in Blue ray but I haven't found it yet. If you like Romance and Ecchi you will love this series.",1365206400,,270,4.0
5036571,4,B006XDU80A,"When I started watching this I was kind of lost. I wondered who the 2 twins were. I wondered why Rito's best friend was in love with Rito's girl transformation. I did some research and found that there was an OVA in-between the first season and this one. Many questions you have with this season should be answered if you see the OVA. Unfortunately, I don't think that Sentai has released it to us yet.

This season is exactly what you would expect after seeing season 1. It is more perverted, and there is way more nudity. Not the blurry kind either. The comedy, romance, and drama are all a little better than season 1. Not much really happens in this season though. I really liked the climax. It is kind of a hard series to end and please everyone. I think that they did a pretty good job. I strongly recommend this anime to any fan that doesn't mind pervy situations and nudity. It's produced quite well and a whole lot of fun. My only 2 complaints are the lack of an English dub and the skipping of the OVA, which really needs to be seen before this season. Those are both on Sentai though. The anime itself is really fun.",1362528000,2,1127,4.316037735849057
5036572,5,B006XDU80A,"This is the 3rd installment after OVA's if you want to go in order.  Each episode is a short story attempting to keep track with the chapters, however, this one is a little more uncensored (in this version) than the 1st and the situations are a little more mature as well.  The original returning characters plus the additions from the OVA to include a flower girl, Lala's younger twin sisters, and a new body for the ghost.  The humor is still there along with their adventures, but you still get involved trying to figure out who will Rito choose from all his vast selection.  The flowchart for the love connections are pretty linear, however, there are some weird ones as well.",1361404800,,680,4.595041322314049
5036573,2,B006XDU80A,"Just for the record, this is NOT the second series of To Love-Ru. It is the THIRD series. The ova series of 6 episodes is the reals econd series, and introduces some crucial characters, including Lala's younger twin sisters Momo and Nana, as well as Celine. The ova also introduces Rito's female self, Riko. If you go from the first series to the third, you will be needlessly confused. Sentai has licensed the fourth series, Darkness, but has still not even acknowledged they missed a series; they call Darkness season three, which it definitely is not.

Sentai also does a substandard job on the translation and the subtitles in this series. At one point they mistranslate ""class representative"" as ""head of the council."" Sorry, but Haruna is not President of her school's student council. Not even remotely.

This is a good series, but I will be discarding my hopeless Sentai dvds (it even has audio and video glitches), and keeping the fansubbed Japanese bluray rips, which have superior video quality AND better subtitles. I firmly believe in supporting the industry by buying legal retail dvds and blurays, but there are limits, and mediocre quality like this passes mine. Sentai doesn't even acknowledge my complaints, so they don't deserve any more of my money.

I highly recommend you watch this series. I also highly recommend you do NOT buy this release.",1360281600,7,1365,4.926086956521739
5036574,5,B006XDU80A,"I absolutely love this series and can't wait until I'm able to buy ""To Love Ru: Darkness"" as well. This series is my favorite ecchi comedy anime at the moment and I would highly recommend it.",1357084800,,191,4.333333333333333
5036575,3,B006XDU80A,"This series is funny.  that is all.

THIS SERIES IS FUNNY.  THAT'S IT!

ONLY ONE THING ABOUT THIS ANIME. FUNNY.",1354665600,,111,4.4
5036576,3,B006XDU80A,"This is funny, but if you are expecting a good story look elsewhere. This is just like the other series, pointless fan service.",1351987200,,127,4.565217391304348
5036577,5,B006XDU80A,"I love Lala and her friends.  the epoisodes are short and sweet and very funny.  I suffered withdrawals after it was all over. No English dub but who cares since the last release was the same.  If you liked the first 26 episodes, then you are really going to want to get this.",1348531200,,276,4.169811320754717
5036578,4,B006XDU80A,"Thanks to the folks who pointed out that this is actually the second season and not the first. So this collection is complete.

I saw this one quite some time after I saw the first season. I mistakenly thought it was from the first season because of an episode where Rito is subjected to a gender transformation and becomes a girl.  This happened in one of the first season episodes but it happens to him again in the second season.  This is what led me to think this collection was from the first season.

This is a really funny, crazy series that is a lot of fun to watch.",1348185600,2,574,4.238532110091743
5036579,5,B006XDU80A,I was kinda thrown for a loop by 3 mini episodes in each actual episode but it actually turned out to be pretty good and was a nice way to end the series although I expected a bit more from rito I can't say I was disappointed with anything,1347408000,2,239,3.8979591836734695
5036580,5,B006XDU80A,as far as this version go's it  is the un censored version and i really enjoyed the series the ending is left open and you don't quite get a good perspective on what might could would happen but the actual series is a pretty interesting harem style anime .. there are a lot of tit and but shots in this but nothing beyond that.,1347062400,4,327,4.109375
5036581,4,B006XDU80A,"Genre: Harem, Comedy

For those that have seen the first season, this watches like an apology letter for the failed attempt at forcing a dramatic story.

Overall, it is a pretty breezy show involving a harem of women (including aliens) and incompetent protagonist that can't seem to do much with them.  The scenes and situations are funny.  The show is heavy on fan service with plenty of nudity and panty shots to go around.  Worth a watch.",1338163200,17,441,4.675324675324675
5036582,4,B006XDU80A,"This edition advertised on this page and site is NOT the highly censored one that was reviewed by the above reviewer. As I was stuck (twice) with that other version and I have purchased this version from this site I can state without qualifications this one does not have post-production censorship. Whatever the original production was,this is it.
Newly introduced into this continuing farse are Lala's twin sisters,Momo and Nana and a something that was a potted plant in the flower garden and is now a small child of sorts;no explainations beyond that are given. The designs of the sisters is exceptional and they are unusually attractive and as lively as LaLa...and even more mischievious. Rito,the designated ""hero"",somehow manages to get his head and/or hands up the skirt of some female (and once up the skirt of a male)or a handful of teen-ager boobs or is caught naked in the bath in every episode;not that it was his intent,mind you. This series is broken into 3 dozen mini-episodes of about 8 minutes each,set in clusters of 3 much like OVAs that,except for the last 3,the storylines are not related to each other.
This is not a course in astrophysics or any other scholary persuit so watching this probably isn't going to do much for acidemica. This is a very well drawn,fast-paced series of fan-servise,nudity and just plain comedic ecchi(naughtiness) but,except for the merging ""lotitaconism"" of Mikan,the middle school sister,it is otherwise devoid of vulgarity. Mikan,Rito's 14-year-old sister has a role as the ""straight"" man in a comedy act whose dead-pan comments and reactions to total lunacy add immeasurably to the series and is the ONLY sane and stable member of the entire cast,as it were, was generaly left alone in the previous season and this is also done so for the first half of this season,her modesty begins to be outraged in the later half to the point of being pantsed and fondled by her brother,gratuitious panty shots and her underwear pulled by  aliens. A 5 star rating based soley on the artwork and the apparent success of the artists/directors to produce ""delightfully  naughty nonsense"" as opposed to a serious work is reduced by a half star bring this work to 4 and a half stars because to the williness to outrage a MIDDLE school early teen for no apparent reason except to toss a ""bone"" to jerks. Still,this version anime is funny and well worth the time/money for those 16+.Any other version not released by this company is a waste of money and will only make you really cranky,REALLY cranky!",1334188800,31,2536,4.8816705336426915

8506240,5,B006XDU80A,"While To Love Ru was quite random in its various plots, Motto To Love Ru has a more focused storyline that promises to hold your attention for the duration of the show.
