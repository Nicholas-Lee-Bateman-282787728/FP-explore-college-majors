4443853,3,B004P2VQXY,"What can you say about Otto Preminger? He made movies unlike others at the time. He would make a film that chose a topic others would not want. Such was the case with ""Hurry Sundown."" A great cast for sure. Jane Fonda and Michael Caine were both good. (Though Michael Caine doing an American Southern accent was not completely believable!) Burgess Meredith was very good though as a Southern judge. The rest of the cast was good also. This is the first time I've seen this film since it was shown on network TV. It was good to watch again.",1308873600,7,539,4.4
4443854,5,B004P2VQXY,"I have found in the past that when an ""obscure"" film finally makes it to DVD that the transfer is often questionable and often looks like it was copied from a VHS tape. Not so with this movie. It looks beautiful! Vivid colors, few blemishes. Don't hesitate to purchase this if you are interested. Great cast including an early performance from Faye Dunaway who, by the way, refused to ever work with Otto Preminger again.",1307059200,10,421,4.626666666666667
4443855,4,B004P2VQXY,"With ""Hurry Sundown"" (1967) Otto Preminger was beginning his decline which was the last big budgeted film based on a controversial best-seller which Preminger thrived on in the fifties for his taste for built-in controversy (""Anatomy of a Murder,"" ""Advise and Consent"") (in defense of ""Hurry Sundown"" the screenwriters couldn't have been more competent to turn K.B. Gilden's massive novel into a film: Horton Foote (""The Trip to Bountiful"") and Thomas C. Ryan (Carson McCullers' ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter""), great screenwriters who know the South).  Preminger, beside the reputation as a tyrant on the set (here Faye Dunaway paid off her contract she earned from Preminger to never have to work with him again), Otto was a great humanist who through ""Hurry Sundown"" managed to present a well-measured and seasoned dose of racial conflict (that the reality of surfaced during the shooting of the film).  Critic Rex Reed who took pot shots at Preminger for the rest of his career was called upon to make retractions about falsities he printed during the making as well).  The critics who panned Preminger's later work taken together can ""make my skin crawl"" as Jane Fonda later says to Michael Caine after she realizes what he's capable of, and here's to wishing they can speak of his praises. Preminger as a film-maker rarely went over budget and his direction can be fascinating to watch in his conciseness.  Michael Caine manages his Southern accent well despite his own natural accent and Jane Fonda, Frank Converse, Robert Hooks, John Phillip Law, Faye Dunaway, Diahann Carroll, Burgess Meredith, George Kennedy, Beah Richards, Madeleine Sherwood, Doro Merande, Jim Backus, Robert Reed are all well-cast.  The result is campy, but there are a few genuinely touching scenes (especially from Beah Richards) that receive help from Hugo Montenegro's wonderful score.  Preminger did not do anything on such a grand scale again, at least until the failure of ""Rosebud"" in 1975 (which deserves to be seen today as it deals with terrorism and could have likely been taken from today's headlines).  ""Hurry Sundown"" was rated ""C"" by the Catholic Legion of Decency upon release, and Preminger's scenes that heightened that controversy (the saxophone scene between Caine and Fonda) and other touches that spiced the content remain adult today as the film still carries an ""O"" rating for ""Objectionable"" which the Catholics use today than their original ratings even in some cases changing the ratings through the years to less offensive depending on their judgement.  I am glad Olive Films has taken up to releasing all of Preminger's Paramount product at the end of his career.  They are a class act.  They are in support apparently of the greatness that was Otto Preminger and you should too.",1305936000,13,2789,5.083150984682713
4443856,4,B004P2VQXY,"Get ready for a heady, potboiler version of the K.B. Gilden, hot-button novel about Southern racism in 1946 Georgia. Otto Preminger gathers a terrific cast and piles on the cheap controversy in overdose mode: beyond-beastly bigots; sappy, sentimentalized white-trash; saintly black sharecroppers belting out designer spirituals; and a delightfully vile bourgeois who ties his brat up in a crib. Fonda sucks Caines saxophone in a film that fairly competes with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS as the best camp of the sixties.  Hugo Montenegro contributes a colorful, evocative score that sadly hasn't seen the light of day on CD.

4443893,5,B004P2VQXY,"This is a controversial film even if it has been 45 years since it was first released in 1967. However, whereas the film was initially perceived to be about racism in Georgia after World War II and prior to the civil rights movement, the film is also about classism and how institutional infrastructure and power relationships suppressed not only poor African Americans but also the poor white sharecroppers of rural Georgia. The film is about corruption and it does a darn good job at exploring the intimate nature of those with power and those without power. In 1967 the film would naturally be seen as a groundbreaking film about racism, but after 45 years, we see much more commentary about the nature of power and the ability to economically suppress others, including loved ones and relatives.

The cast is absolutely terrific. Michael Caine plays ambitious Henry Warren whose plans go awry when his schemes unfold and the oppressed organize. Jane Fonda, like Elizabeth Taylor, is one of the few actresses who can create a genuine sounding southern accent. She is Henry's naive wife Julie Ann. Henry's poor sharecropper cousin, played by John Phillip Law, is one of the intended victims. Julie Ann's old maid, Rose, played by Beah Richards, is the other intended victim.

The southern bigotry may seem overdone to younger audiences but this was 1946 small farm town Georgia and this type of racism did exist and it did have an economic function. The justice system was corrupt when it came to racial issues and Burgess Meredith as Judge Purcell and George Kennedy as Sherriff Coombs are maser actors who create authenticity with their acting skills in these roles a villains.

 Are the poor idealized in this film? Yes, to be honest. Robert Hooks plays Beah Richards' son Reeve and he and Diahann Carroll, playing Vivian Thurlow, are two of the heroic figures in the film. Faye Dunnaway plays John Phillip Law's wife and the depiction of this white family is accurate.

The dialogue is sometimes shocking but authentic and screenwriters  Horton Foote and Thomas C. Ryan capture the feel of poor Georgia. This is a pretty fascinating film even if it seems over the top at times. However, in hindsight, it may have been more realistic that was once thought.",1330128000,5,2261,4.8903394255874675

4443895,4,B004P2VQXY,"[HURRY SUNDOWN - (1967) - Widescreen presentation]  Personally, I'm glad Olive films are releasing a handful of Otto Preminger's films from his latter career that weren't previously available. 'Such Good Friends' (1971) was such an unexpected treat that I jumped on this one immediately, though the results were murky this time out. First off, the audio is not as good as other Olive films; this one's all treble with no bass and little mid-section, and can be grating during certain dialogue-heavy scenes. The video is good, not great, but the aspect ratio is fine. And I'm a fan of Preminger's directorial skills - so no problem there. Now let's discuss the cast and not-so-petty annoyances, shall we?

Before I go on, let me state that I love Michael Caine's body of work during the 60's, 70's and 80's. But he's so horribly miscast here as a Southern landowner in 1940's Georgia that he threatens to destroy the essence of the entire film. His cockney confederate accent is mostly atrocious, and he's the lynchpin in a film about racial prejudice, avaricious land-grabbing and civil unrest - he's about as Southern as a mint julep in Buckingham Palace. He looks the part, but every other time he utters a sentence, his credibility's crushed. The same can be said of Jane Fonda (another actor I adored throughout her 60s' work) - she slips in and out of a Southern drawl constantly throughout the film, but is still compelling to watch. As a matter of fact, the only actors who lend credence to the film's location and time period are Burgess Merideth (simply scorching as a racist redneck judge), George Kennedy (duplicating the sheriff's role he played in 'Cool Hand Luke' the previous year), Faye Dunaway (though her role is decidedly smaller than you'd think, as 'Bonnie and Clyde' hadn't been released yet) and the considerably lesser-known character actors. Hardly anyone else sounds like they've even vacationed in the south, seen a Tennessee Williams play or even caught an episode of 'Green Acres', let alone 'Hee Haw'. Robert Hooks and Diahann Carroll, as poor black farmers, sound about as country black as Cicily Tyson and James Earl Jones. And John Phillip Law appears to be in rehearsal for the emotional range needed for his upcoming role in 'Danger: Diabolik' (a Euro comic book). There's no way Preminger was unaware of this, but who knew what he was thinking?

If it weren't for the many cars and trucks littered about informing us of the era, you'd certainly never know it from the way the women were dressed - there's nothing even remotely 1940's about the dresses Jane Fonda slinks in and out of, not that I'm complaining so much here, just making a costuming point. Even Hugo Montenegro's score is suffering from MPD (multiple personality disorder); the first half of the film it's as melodramatically sappy as its plot before shifting gears later on, infusing 60's soul-groove sounds at inappropriate moments. But, in hindsight, the film is a transcendent trainwreck that's captivating in spite of itself. Partially because of the cast, even those miscast, partially because of Preminger's distinct eye, style and timing (was this film made before or after he did acid with Groucho Marx while filming 'Skidoo'? If it was after, no explanations are needed), partially 'cause it was the experimental 60's when throwing disparate objects and ideas into a blender to forge something new was all the rage. As much as I might otherwise like to, I can't in good faith trash this flick for being the trash some would consider it to be. OK, so it's not 'Laura', 'Anatomy of a Murder' or 'Man with the Golden Arm', but it sure is a lot of fun to watch (despite the shockingly racist remarks and dialogue) in a latter-day John Waters meets Harold Robbins sort of way...3 1/2 stars.",1311724800,19,3796,4.8639876352395675
4443896,4,B004P2VQXY,"I remember watching this as a kid on TV. Later I found the long sprawling novel (over 1000 pages listed as being written by KB Gilden who is in fact 2 writers), and attempted to read it. I found the book boring.

Preminger has made this movie interesting culled from dull material but adding a healthy dose of suds. Feuding landowners, blacks against whites, rich and poor. It is all here set in the steamy South. But Faulkner it ain't!

There is one scene that is jarringly hammy when a young Jane Fonda sits on her ""Mammy's"" lap in an old sharecropper's shanty. Her performance does personify a wonderful sense of the pampered Southern, ""woman/child"" married to a sometimes hammy and too evil Michael Caine who wants to take control of the lands sharecropped by the blacks owned by wealthy Fonda. Fonda shines brighter with several other cast members. Making this a very watchable movie. A Preminger trademark, hence the 4 star rating. If this was handled under lesser experienced hands and cast, I would rate it ONE.

It's a great movie, just don't take it too seriously, y'all. Good Southern Corn.

8437463,3,B004P2VQXY,"Review of Hurry Sundown
Hot Toasty Rag, October 8, 2017

Its difficult to concisely describe the plot of Hurry Sundown; its a film about the racial divide, family squabbles, class distinction, and corporate takeover of land. Among the subplots are marital difficulties, Southern life, parenthood, a developmentally challenged child, questionable honor of the legal system, and coming-of-age dilemmas.

Michael Caine is married to Jane Fonda, and while they're a well-to-do Southern couple on the outside, beneath the surface lies infidelity and parenting issues. Michaels poor cousin, John Phillip Law, is married to Faye Dunaway, and he also has trouble with his children. Robert Hooks and his mother Beah Richards live on land that used to belong to Janes family, back when they owned slaves. As a gift, they gave the land to Beah, but when Michael Caines company wants to build on it, racial tensions lead to unforeseen consequences that affect all three families.

Even though I have a soft spot in my heart for Michael Caine and refuse to ever really see him as a bad guy, hes known for his meaner roles. In Hurry Sundown, hes just about as mean as it gets. He gives a fantastically chilling performance, and his Southern accent is nearly flawless. Faye Dunaway also stands out in her smaller role, since its unlike the cold, calculating, classy roles she usually takes. Be on the lookout for Diahann Carroll, Burgess Meredith, and George Kennedy as the adorable but incompetent sheriff.

This is a very well-acted film that fits in with other hot-blooded films of its time, like In the Heat of the Night and The Long, Hot Summer. Its one of the steamiest films made in the 1960s, and it sheds light on a number of important issues. Director Otto Preminger, king of films that push the envelope, creates another masterpiece that makes you feel like you need a good scrubbing after watching it.
