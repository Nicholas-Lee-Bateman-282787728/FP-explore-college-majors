5184315,5,B008V8NRV2,It has good history content and it is taught in an interesting way. I liked the blacksmith who brought it back to life too.,1360281600,,123,4.166666666666667
5184316,4,B008V8NRV2,"This DVD, ""Secrets Of The Viking Sword"", has two currents working simultaneously through it. Firstly, there is the story of Middle Ages swords marked ""ULFBERHT"" which are made of steel so advanced for the time that modern experts are shocked by their quality. Secondly, there is the story of modern blacksmith Richard Furrer who will attempt to make a sword like the ULFBERHT swords using old technology and methods to discover the secret of how the originals were made.

The DVD covers the Viking age as well as the type of swords used in northern Europe during the time the ULFBERHT swords were made. Compared to the ULFBERHT swords, other swords made during this time period consist of steel that is full of impurities and have little carbon making them brittle and prone to breaking in battle. There are discussions and demonstrations of fighting techniques and weaponry by modern experts of ancient weaponry to explain for the viewer why these swords were so advanced compared to others of the time.

The video covers Richard Furrer's attempt to make an ULFBERHT sword using crucible steel. Using no modern tools or techniques, Furrer makes a sword as close as he can to the original in an attempt to show how such swords could have been made. There is an amount of uncertainty because there is no way of knowing how these rare weapons were actually made.

My main criticism is that the makers of this video seem to have decided that the steel itself was imported from central Asia even though there is no evidence for this. There seems to be a bias against the northern Europeans who crafted these swords that, somehow, they weren't capable of making better steels and it had to come from somehwere else. It is just as likely (or more so) that a small number of smiths discovered a technique that was later lost.

All in all, I thought it was a very interesting documentary that devled into many aspects of weapons and warfare of the period that produced these magnificent swords. Four stars.",1359763200,15,1998,4.749279538904899
5184317,4,B008V8NRV2,good documentary with real info and good feedback from the old times into the world of today. Shows the real skills of the old world,1358899200,,132,4.32
5184318,3,B008V8NRV2,"This DVD is only about one Viking sword, the Ulfberth.
The narrator states, that the crucible methode used to make that steel, was highly superior to the pattern welding of other Viking swords. I strongly doubt that! The Viking sword, in difference to roman gladius, japanese Katana and crussader swords, had a flexible blade, which I don't think can be achieved by using only one single steel! Modern pattern welded replicas of Viking swords, show their vast superiority to swords of earlier or later periods!

It would have been better to make a program about the different types of Viking swords and different forging technics, and to compare different modern accurate replicas in tests.",1352505600,6,690,5.052631578947368
5184319,3,B008V8NRV2,"While a good production, I felt the emphasis was too much on some of the showy bits, like the reenactors bashing away. The too brief part by the sword master could have been expanded.  The descriptions by the sword smith were great and very illustrative. But for me, crucial technical questions like what the crucible was made of and exactly how they achieved 3000' F when the Romans didn't would have really improved it for me.  Also, an explanation of why the katana needed multiple layers of steel and why this Viking didn't would also have been a great comparative analysis.
Worth viewing though, and glad I bought it but it left several questions unanswered.",1351987200,10,663,4.756521739130434
5184320,5,B008V8NRV2,"What is in a name? Considered the ultimate weapon of the Viking era.
The authentic swords that bore this name inscribed were of remarkable
craftsmanship and made of a unique steel.

This hands-on documentary film provides succinct information packed
with colourful descriptions that truly enhances the acceptability of
the viewer to see it again and again!

The production is of extremely high calibre.

Strongly recommended!

5184321,5,B008V8NRV2,"Another good Nova show; this one explores the technology of some of the Viking swords, the ones that used crucible steel and were clearly better than anything else in Europe at the time.

Nova works with experts in metallurgy (including a blacksmith and a steel company), experts in Medieval armor and swords, experts in Medieval history, and makes a very complete exploration of the topic.

One weapons expert shows how Samurai swords differ from the Viking swords and why they were better for European styles of fighting.  Samurai swords were very sharp and cut well, but these Viking swords, the so-called Ulfbehrt swords, were tough and flexible, could tear a shield to pieces without getting broken during the effort.

They trace the history of this steel and even the name ""Ulfbehrt"" and the blacksmith makes another Viking sword, the first in probably a thousand years, using the techniques they probably used.

I won't spoil it for you by revealing all they learn (and all that is still a mystery!)  Suffice it to say that, if you are interested in the science of metallurgy or in Medieval weapons and fighting, or in history in general, this will be of interest to you.  It isn't complete -- 50 minutes can't cover it all -- but it is as thorough as you can get in that amount of time.",1422576000,,1294,4.699115044247788

5184325,5,B008V8NRV2,"I teach 7th-grade history in Los Angeles, and used this DVD to demonstrate to my students the amount of ingenuity, time, skill, and labor that was involved in creating a good tool or weapon in Medieval Europe.  My 12/13-year olds were both shocked and appalled, and repeatedly said, ""I wouldn't do that.  It's not worth it.""  This is a generation that, in my experience, gets bored with most things in about two minutes, so I wasn't surprised.  By the time the DVD was over, however, most had changed their minds.

Other reviewers have summarized the DVD quite well.  For me, I am delighted that we have Ric Furrer, a modern blacksmith who eschews modern technology to make old-fashioned things in the old-fashioned way.  While there were unsanswered questions (Just what was Ric's crucible made from?), and while I would have liked more demonstration of Viking fighting techniques (What was it like to fight in a shieldwall?), those are minor quibbles, along the lines of wishing the DVD were something else instead of accepting it for what it is..

I've watched this DVD with about 120 seventh-graders (six times), whose interest was held throughout, and with my wife (once), who was fascinated by Furrer's craftsmanship and the very personal relationship he had with the steel he was forging.  For me, the amount of information presented both about blacksmithing and the Vikings was more than enough to keep my attention.

A rock-solid five stars from me.",1399766400,7,1458,4.938524590163935
5184326,5,B008V8NRV2,"If you are into Viking history like I am, you will love this movie.  I didn't know about this rare Viking sword, much less that the steel used was such high grade.",1391385600,,163,4.09375
5184327,5,B008V8NRV2,"If you're into Vikings, swords, blacksmithing or Renaissance fairs, you are going to love this!  The sword was called Ulfberht.  And it wasn't just one sword, it was a whole class of swords created by an unknown blacksmith who combined steel from the orient with techniques refined in war.  The result was a near perfect blend of strength, balance, flexibility and light weight, unequaled until the 20th century.

The documentary follows a modern-day blacksmith who may have re-discovered the recipe and techniques for making crucible steel.  And as the story unfolds, we learn more about Viking warfare and the fighting techniques that made this sword devastating to its enemies.",1391040000,2,680,5.201834862385321
5184328,3,B008V8NRV2,"Some great information and back story, at least as much as they know. But then it just ended.  Where's the rest of the story? Show the finished sword for more than 5 seconds! How well did it work? This video needed to be another 20-30 minutes longer. Are we supposed to wait for a sequal or something!? As you can probably already guess, I'm just a little disappointed. But not totally. What is there is good.",1375142400,,409,4.381578947368421
5184329,3,B008V8NRV2,"Liked the video quite a bit. Only thing that bothered me was that they never really show the new sword. There's one brief picture that looked like it could have been the sword lying on it's side, but it could just as easily have been a computer-generated image, which was my first thought. Lots of close-ups of the inlaid name, but if it actually turned out that good, then why wasn't there any video of the whole sword being waved around and showing both sides? I suspect the end broke off of it or something equally horrendous. There had to have been 20 times more video of the original swords, and as someone else mentioned, too much of the recreated battles. I'll watch Braveheart if I want to see that stuff. I watched this to learn about how it was made, not to find out that they swung it around in battle, duh.",1372982400,,818,4.352941176470588

8530802,5,B008V8NRV2,"This is a very fine craftsman's tour de force with the aid of excellent research on the part of one metallurgist aided by many museums scholars in Europe.  It's amazing to watch the sword fabricated, the skill is astounding.  I wish there had been more on the final steps in the time consuming finishing of the fullers.  Being avidly interested in the subject I could have sat through several hours of the swordsmith's work but this is a wonderful DVD to own.
Bless everybody concerned - terrific achievement!  I know many medieval reenactors, blacksmiths and a few blademiths and all who have seen it loved it.  You can't find fault with an honest craftsman of this very high skill level ( unless you're an ignorant troll of delusionary self importance).",1492300800,,755,4.776923076923077

8530805,5,B008V8NRV2,"Love this documentary. Even though I wish they went into more detail, and actually had the Ulfberht go against the Katana to show that the katana isn't all it is cracked up to be. The Katana is still a good sword, but I'm not as big of a fan as the katana as others.

Anyways, there are discrepancies as with any documentary, but overall they seemed to know what they were talking about.",1466899200,,387,4.301369863013699
