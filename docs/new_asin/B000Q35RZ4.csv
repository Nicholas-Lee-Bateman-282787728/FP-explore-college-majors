8194085,5,B000Q35RZ4,"I am a dance teacher in Belgium. While I was reading the reviews, one thing became clear to me. Some people who were not satisfied expected perhaps a more stylish approach. My meaning is this: the dvd's are very good. You get a boatload of figures for a cheap price. Most people dance social and for this purpose the dvd's are outstanding. For technique and competition style on a higher level there are other dvd's, but the best way to learn at that level is a good teacher and a lot of private lessons. So again I say, this dvd's are very good. I bought them all because I was ""raised"" in the international style. The American style defers from our system . However, keep up the good work, Joe! I hope that you record even more dvd's in the future.",1468540800,,750,4.326241134751773

8194087,2,B000Q35RZ4,"The video provides several dance patterns from beginners to advance. This video teaching lesson could be better if each lesson will have several repetition. Also the music used is always the same music. If several variation of music were used, it would be nice. This makes me feel it is a 2 star rating.",1327190400,,303,4.62962962962963
8194088,4,B000Q35RZ4,"this hustle dance video has many moves and easy to follow.  one thing that has to be improved is the quality of video at the end  which is kinda blurd, the video was taken from old vhs tapes i suspect.",1281312000,,201,4.0
8194089,1,B000Q35RZ4,"I have to agree with the other review, about the poorness of this video.  The man has little to no form, and in most steps just looks like he is walking...not dancing.  In addition, at the start of the video the make the point to say that many beginners suddenly drop on count one to start their rise...this is exactly what the girl does in the video.  Their posture is awful and their frame is horrible.  I find it hard to trust she even knows most of the figures well.  If you want a good American Waltz video look at [...] or something, these are professionals who are teaching.  While this video might be good for very beginners, it is certainly not for someone who knows something about waltz already.  Even if you are a beginner, I would suggest something different.  Start with good skills, don't learn something wrong and then need to relearn it again in the future.",1271116800,,874,4.452830188679245
8194090,5,B000Q35RZ4,"I liked this learn to dance dvd. The pace was good, not too slow or too fast. Lots of info on one dvd.",1214179200,,102,3.4782608695652173
8194091,5,B000Q35RZ4,"The style seems to be slightly country-western, but the figures are American style ballroom. The video contains much content - enough to create a complete advanced routine. Starts with an easy ""follow the leader"" approach for the basic figures. The more advanced figures require much review. Fortunately the DVD structure allows skipping back to the start of each figure. The teachers are not awesome, but they are good enough to be credible.  The figures can be danced via ""lead and follow"" with about any good dancer.",1207612800,2,519,5.034883720930233
8194092,1,B000Q35RZ4,"The title and description are entirely misleading. This is not your typical waltz. They teach a country style waltz. The moves look like country line dancing and waltz meshed together; it is laughable. The second video is very short and useless; it teaches about 5 moves. The first(primary) video teaches a lot of moves, but only 3 of them are worthy of being used in a real ballroom(as opposed to a country bar). The teacher is monotone. He also attempts to teach proper form; that attempt was so bad that I had to spend extra time to erase his instruction and re-establish my development prior to his ""assistance"". Most of the steps are nearly impossible to learn as his partners long dress is often blocking vision of his feet. I was very disappointed.",1191715200,2,755,4.684210526315789
