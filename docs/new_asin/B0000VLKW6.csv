1953597,5,B0000VLKW6,I have to admit to being very cynical and was when I picked up this DVD.  I was interested to check out the amount of variety and of course the effectiveness of the programs contained on the DVD.  Im glad I was wrong on this one.  While so many fitness videos rely on one simple workout this one offers up tons of workouts allowing me to progess to the next level without having to go out and buy another one.  Talk about value.  I simply use the programs here along with a sensible diet and lost 30 pounds in 6 months!,1096934400,14,519,4.099009900990099
1953598,4,B0000VLKW6,"I didn't realize that Mary was an Iyengar instructor until she started stacking up blankets to form a bolster, then I caught on.

If you already are practicing the Iyengar style, I am sure you will like this video.  There are not a lot of Iyengar videos out there, and this is well done.

For those not familiar with the style, it is not a ""flowing"" style like Ashtanga.  In a typical class you would work on a pose for a while, then work on a different pose.  It's actually ideally suited to construct practices out of segments, as on this DVD.

It's a great way to really learn a pose thoroughly, even if you are practicing a different form of yoga.

By the way, ignore the ""weight loss"" title.  There is nothing on this video that is specific for that purpose.  If your aim in practicing yoga is to have an intense workout and burn calories, this is not the type of video you are looking for.",1093046400,94,895,4.279761904761905
1953599,5,B0000VLKW6,I have really enjoyed this DVD.  I am a bit overweight and wanted to do something.  Yoga is good for that.  Not too hard and there is 8 different things on the beginners level to work through.  The instructor is encouraging also...,1092355200,4,231,4.428571428571429
1953600,1,B0000VLKW6,"This DVD appears to have many options for your workout. But, I found it really annoying! She jumps from pose to pose with no preparation or flow. One minute she's standing, then they cut to lying on the ground, without any time to really get there. And, the editing is bad. You'll actually here her mess up the dialogue and say something like ""man, I can't say that word today""... it was distracting. Plus, I found her voice to be grating. Need I go on??? There are other good DVD's out there - don't waste your money on this one. I wish I hadn't.",1090281600,12,547,4.269230769230769
1953601,5,B0000VLKW6,"I found myself out of shape after some time of not exercising and eating too much I guess.
When I tried to get back into shape I was discouraged because it was hard for me to do some more strenuous exercises after not doing anything.  A friend recommended yoga to me as part of a plan to get back into shape, and I found this DVD a few months ago, and it has started to work.
I am careful with what I eat, and use this DVD often.  My flexibility is starting to return and so is my energy.  I like the intructors encouragement, and her interview is great.  Sometimes when I feel discouraged or think I can never get back into shape, I watch that part again.
The various routines and times are a big plus for me, and her instruction is very good.  If you are looking for something to help you I would suggest this title as part of whatever you are doing to get back in shape.
The one thing that I should also mention is that it is not an aerobic exercise, though you will feel it and sweat at points.  If you are looking for something that is more ""power"", then this may not be the DVD for you and you should probably not get it.  If you are looking for something to help you get back on track, then this is perfect.",1088640000,8,1214,4.054393305439331
1953602,3,B0000VLKW6,"I will definintely continue working through this DVD. The instructor is indeed extremely knowledgeable with incredible form. On the other hand, each routine is not a flowing practice. Each asana is filmed seperately, and then they're stuck together to form the different routines. It's a bit more reliant on props (blankets, blocks) than I prefer. It also really seemed too fast paced for beginners, and there seems to be almost no emphasis on when and how to breathe. What bothered me the most perhaps was I felt like I was listening to an over-syrupy, stereotypical kindergarten teacher. (Nothing against kindergarten teachers - they have a hard job and I admire them.) Still, by the end of the routines, I want to reach through the set and throttle the woman for being so saccharine. Still, I think that warmth and soft, high-pitched voice is soothing for some people. I will keep watching to learn new postures, but I think I'm going to stick with just doing what I've learned to music and not the DVD.",1079481600,4,1006,4.787356321839081
1953603,2,B0000VLKW6,"This DVD is boring unmotivating. IF you are looking for a power yoga tape this is not it. The woman seems to know about 4 postures and repeats them until you want to scream. If you prefer a more fluid yoga workout I'd recommend something else. The benifit is you do feel good after one of the workouts. If you are a beginner this might be a good start, but if you have trained in yoga before this would not be a good tape to purchase.",1076112000,2,434,4.058139534883721
1953656,5,B0000VLKW6,"I love this DVD!  I am an intermediate level Iyengar student and outside of class have practiced using other DVD's by Rodney Yee and Kathy Smith (non Iyengar), and while I like them both as instructors and the routines were challenging, I found that I didn't use them more than a couple of times as it was difficult to keep up with the pace and they just didn't hold my interest.  But with this video of interesting, well-paced sequences and Mary's wisdom and gentle and precise teaching, I look forward to my practice and my time with Mary.  I am living in Rome where there aren't many Iyengar yoga studios and the classes don't fit my schedule so I have been using this DVD and Mary has become my yoga companion as well as instructor here.

I really enjoy listening to Mary in the interview segment and I believe she has a lot of wisdom when it comes to using yoga to integrate the various aspects of our being.  I have found it to be true from my personal experience that when we are aligned spiritually, mentally and physically, weight loss happens naturally as a result.

As has been said, this is not a power yoga practice; to me it is a peaceful yoga practice, which is what I believe yoga is about.  This practice makes me feel good about myself and I believe this inner peace is what leads to my weight loss.  I find the music and Mary's voice and pace very soothing and perfect for this type of practice.  The fact that it wasn't filmed on a beach doesn't bother me because I practice indoors and focus more on what is happening with my body and mind than what is presented in the background of the video.

If you are looking for an encouraging, positive companion to lead you in proper alignment through varied sequences and inspiring you with her wisdom, Mary's video is the one for you!  I am very happy that I brought it with me and that Mary is part of my personal growth and adventure in Rome!",1234742400,,1909,4.364406779661017
1953657,3,B0000VLKW6,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned that this DVD is pretty HARD.  Just as one example, in the ""Positive Outlook"" practice under the Beginners menu, there is a downward dog segment in which we hold DD for a minute and a half (which is really pretty long for us beginners), immediately followed by a segment with a slow flow from downward dog to plank to upward dog to chaturanga and back--repeated twice!  This is another four and a half minutes of intensive arm and core work.  Thank heavens for a rest in child's pose, but wait! you're not done yet; the next segment has you doing FOUR MORE upward dogs.  I tell you, this sequence hasn't improved my outlook yet. There are several other practices that have similarly difficult sections.

Not that there's anything wrong with challenging work---it's just that I have this image of overweight and out-of-shape people grabbing this DVD in search of some positive change and then feeling completely overwhelmed by the seeming impossibility of some of this stuff.  It seems like there could be a little more encouragement from the instructor and recognition that most beginners are not going to be able to whip right through these poses without rests and/or modifications.

There is really some excellent alignment instruction here, but the issues above, coupled with the instructor's odd delivery and the insufficient time provided for setting up between segments, are what make me rate this at three stars only.",1223856000,2,1459,4.954918032786885
1953658,5,B0000VLKW6,"I've taken a few classes, but wanted a DVD for home so that I can use it as is convenient.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  The explanations are good.  There is a good variety of routines that can take me from my novice standing through and advanced level.  There is a section that explains basic information and when she says to do something you can see in her body movements exactly what she means.  I'd buy it again.",1199577600,3,429,4.246913580246914
1953659,5,B0000VLKW6,"I give this video top ratings.  I had done yoga casually for 9 years and only got serious with 4 sessions a week 1 year ago.  I took lessons from Mary, the instructor, at Unity Woods and bought her video.  I love this video and find that I return to it every time one of my faster paced yoga videos causes me to injure myself or forget the many dimensions of good form.  This has 21 workouts, easily navigated and chosen, for beginners to advanced.  The one downside for some may be that this is a series of moves not a flow program.  I combine this with Total Yoga with Tracy Rich, Karen Voight Yoga, Rodney Yee Power Yoga and Yoga for Athletes with Adrienne Reed. These are also awsome, but none give the deep, detailed instruction like Mary's.",1190073600,3,746,4.330935251798561
1953660,5,B0000VLKW6,"This is a nice, slow practice for learning yoga and progressing on to more challenging levels. I have tried other DVDs that are way to fast and are hard to follow. This one is very clear and will still build up a sweat! The teacher is very encouraging and warm.",1175817600,,261,4.24
1953661,5,B0000VLKW6,"The only think I don't like about this DVD is the title.  I almost didn't buy it -- I don't want to lose weight.  And I think it's a misnomer, unless you count an intention adjustment.

That aside, this is great Iyengar istruction.  And there's very little for-real Iyengar available on DVD.  I have the B.K.S. Iyengar Estes Park series but that's more history in the making and this is actual follow-along-with practice.  Mary Pappas-Sandonas has a crisp and clear Iyengar practice and teaches at the prestigious Unity Woods yoga studio -- I'd love to take a class with her someday.

The structure of the DVD is nicely described in previous reviews so I won't even try.  The Body Wisdom modular unit schtick works just fine here.  In particular I like the Challenging Core (toughest core focus I've seen on any video) and Fatigue Fighter.  I had to love this restorative sequence that includes a 2 min. (more or less) downward dog.

My one other quibble (besides the title) is the music.  It's pretty nondescript.  I would have preferred a music-off option so I could play my own selections or just enjoy silence.

I have over a hundred yoga videos -- even more if you count my Pilates, strength training collections...(yoga is definitely my focus though).  I've maintained a daily practice for over 10 years, have done an alignment-centered teacher training and teach now and then.  I (mostly) burned out on vinyasa/""power yoga"" several years ago.

This DVD is defintely suitable for sharing shelf space with Barbara Benagh and Mr. Alignment from Within, Erich Schiffmann.",1174521600,5,1574,4.879245283018868
1953662,5,B0000VLKW6,"Clawing my way out of yet another bout of clinical depression, I've been trying to make small positive changes in my life. Things like getting up in the morning, making the bed, and doing yoga sound simple on paper, but anyone with depression knows they can take every ounce of energy when you're in the depths.

I believe in serendipity, and I'm grateful this DVD found its way into my hands. I've been using it for a little more than a month, and I find that it has become an essential part of my life. With varied session times and several different areas of focus, this DVD is easy to fit into my day, and it allows me to choose the intensity or discipline to match the day's tone. I've never seen a yoga or fitness DVD like it.

This is, as noted, an Iyengar practice, which makes it perfect for me, because the constant insistence on paying attention to each nuance of a pose allows me to go deeper inside myself, at the same time allowing me to move outside myself to become an observer.

I don't have easy access to a yoga teacher or class, and I find that the Iyengar method -- combined with a mirror and this DVD's unique menus that make it possible to tailor the session to meet the day's needs -- is as good a substitute as I'm likely to find.

I consider myself an advanced beginner, and I have not yet become bored by the beginner routines -- haven't yet done them all, in fact. I'm finding that this DVD offers me more opportunities to move deeper into poses I thought I had ""mastered.""

I do need to lose weight, but that wasn't the main reason for purchasing this DVD. If you believe, as I do, that yoga allows one to develop both awareness and acceptance of oneself, then it naturally follows that with regular practice you'd reach a balance and begin to take better care of your body and spirit. I've found this to be true, and I'm losing weight slowly as an indirect result of a more wholistic awareness.

As noted by other reviewers, rather than leading a hard calorie-burning workout, the instructor focuses on poses that affect the body's hormonal balance and organs. My energy level has heightened as a result, and I often find myself heading outside after my yoga session for snowshoeing or some other healthy activity.

The one negative has transformed into something more positive, as well. At first I found the instructor's voice a bit irritating, as was the endless loop of the soundtrack. As I've continued working with the DVD, I've begun to hear compassion and comfort instead.

If you are interested only in a ""power"" yoga workout, you won't find it here. If you want only a spiritual/aesthetic experience, this isn't it. But if you want to learn more about yourself, your body and how it relates to your spirit, and to move deeper into various poses, this is the DVD for you.

The varied workouts at three different levels of difficulty promise to keep me engaged for years to come. And that's what I want and need.",1141257600,30,2949,4.497196261682243
1953663,2,B0000VLKW6,"I, too, found this DVD a bit boring.  The instruction for each pose took forever, even in the challenging workouts.  While in-depth explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices, I didn't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence.  Also, I did not feel as if there was any flow to this DVD.",1140134400,2,319,4.763636363636364
1953664,4,B0000VLKW6,"I have to say this is one of the better fitness DVDs that I've seen in recent memory.  The instructor or whomever produced the DVD actually realized that one size does not fit all and there are tons  of programs to fit just about every fitness level.  The practice is defintely Iyengar which is what I am familiary with, a detailed precise practice aimed at improving or workong on a particular bodypart at a time.  Yoga involves patience and apparently thats what they want to get across here.

The instructor also gives some tips on weight loss, so you get a little more bang for your buck.  I can defintely progress with this DVD.",1139184000,11,633,4.508771929824562
1953665,5,B0000VLKW6,"This is a great DVD to pick up if you want to start getting in shape. The instructor really helps you to tone you're your whole body without exercise equipment. I also noticed it helps with relieving stress as well and is easy to understand with helpful tips. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This DVD has given me better posture, balance, and stamina. I would definetly recommend this to anyone.",1139184000,14,408,4.680555555555555

The instruction is precise and almost baby step for some of the programs , which are good for beginners and rountines more challenging for the more advance.  There is a brief section on diet  and nutrition from the instructor, and the more advance routines more than build up a sweat.",1135728000,4,406,4.690140845070423
1953697,5,B0000VLKW6,"I bought this DVD after the great review it received in the Yoga Journal.  I needed to lose some weight but was also looking for a good yoga practice, and this DVD does that well.

Mary's instruction is clear and precise, as she is an Iyaanger trained instructor as others have indicated.  So you carefully go into the poses and hold them, more so than some other styles of yoga.  Great to really open up your body and developing form.  You move fromm one pose, working on the pose, then move onto the next pose, in Iyanger fashion as oppossed to other styles of yoga, which are more of a pure flow style. The routines, however, are carefully put together and make sense if you have ever studied yoga.

She is encouraging without being too overly sappy or annoying like some others can be - she is much more enthusiastic on her interview than in the actual instruction sections, but it is worthwhile to watch to understand her more, she relates well to the issues that the DVD is trying to address.  Her instruction sections are toned down more than her interview, but she is nevertheless encouraging.

Some have mentioned that the set is not a beach scene, but since I have taken classes more in rooms with wood floors, and not on a beach, this is not a problem for me :)  It is more like a very good class it its presentation, as oppossed to beaches/poor instruction that other DVDs are.

If you care about seeing beaches or looking more for a Vinyasa style of yoga, then you may want to skip this, though if you are looking to really develop your yoga practice it really should give this a chance.

If you are looking to develop good technique in general and/or looking for routines that are designed to affect your metabolism to help increase the bodies ability to work in a certain way to assist in weight loss, you should not hesitate - get this DVD. The extensive amount of material on this DVD from Beginners to Advanced will keep you going for a long time.",1121126400,29,1965,4.445682451253482
1953698,1,B0000VLKW6,"I was excited about this DVD because of the customized workout feature, but I couldn't even make it through a preview. The instructor's voice is grating. She sounds similar to Denise Austin so if you, like me, are sensitive to voice tone: be warned. And then there's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which, to my mind, is entirely wrong for a yoga routine.

If you're looking for a yoga DVD with a customized workout feature, I'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed ""Yoga Shakti"" by Shiva Rea.",1120003200,15,568,5.10752688172043

1953701,5,B0000VLKW6,"I am using this DVD along with Brian Kest's 'Power Yoga' Series.  I am a beginner and also getting close to 50 so I am doing this more to be limber than just to lose weight.

This DVD is soooo great for many reasons.  Mary has more than 25  routines on this DVD, a set for Beginner, a set for Intermediates and a set for Challenging.  The exercises range from 30 mintues to 90 minutes. She offers several variations for the poses should you need bricks, straps or chairs to assist you.  It is not flowing like Power Yoga, but it gives you a chance to really feel the pose and breath into it.

The BEST part of this DVD is that there are NO annoying commercials at the beginning that you can't escape from, that have become the bane of many an exercise DVD.  I can not tell you have many DVD exercise programs that I have that I will never watch again, no matter how wonderful the program because of those endless commercial pitches.

The sections of the DVD that are specifically designed for beginners titled ""Beginning Routines"" is entirely too difficult and too fast paced.  The Iyengar style instructions are good but there is no demonstration of the modifications that are needed for a beginner student. The same is true for the intermediate and challenging routines.  What's more, other than the reference by the author to her losing weight in the ""Interview with Mary"" segment and a few comments during sirvasana about letting go of body image issues this DVD never addresses how any yoga posture or yoga practice can contribute to the weight loss process. I am an experienced Iyengar yoga student who is trying to return to practice after a long illness.  I was able to use this DVD ONLY because I am familiar with how to modify poses using props.  This DVD is just a series of standard, intermediate-level, Iyengar style yoga poses with no information about how to use yoga for weight loss.  It should not be allowed to have ""weight loss"" in the title.  And it should not be purchased by any one who is not physically fit especially anyone who needs to lose weight.  If you need to lose weight do not expect this DVD to help you.  Just plain false advertising that takes away credibility from an otherwise decent yoga instructor.",1417824000,,1475,4.7265625

I have been doing yoga about one year but I am still an amateur.  Dvd has different levels for different experience levels.  Must be over 5 hours for the beginner exercises alone.

8003787,3,B0000VLKW6,"Released in 2004, this video felt somewhat dated, like from before even 2004, and the production quality wasn't very high. (A lot of the videos I've bought recently are older, because those ones are cheap now.) I'm pretty new to yoga (started in April), so not knowing how tough the workouts might or might not be, today I selected the 45-minute beginner ""Greet the Day"" sequence. It featured one woman instructor demonstrating the poses in a large room with a wood floor and an oriental rug in the background. It wasn't a bad setting, but something about the curtains screamed ""lobby of an old folks' home"" to me.

The instructor looked to be somewhere in her 40s, and had an extraordinary command of yoga. The instruction was in voiceover; her voice wasn't particularly annoying, but there was a choppiness about her phrasing, and she occasionally said things that jolted me right out of yoga-mind, like ""release the skin on your face"" (at which I laughed heartily) or ""don't think of the things you desire"" (well...I wasn't until you mentioned them!).

The routine itself was decent, if a little slow. It was slow enough that I didn't feel like I was getting a great workout in, although I wouldn't call it easy, just slow. Even on the beginner level, some things were difficult for me to do; I blame at least part of that on it being the second video in a row I did that used upper-body strength. It ought not be so hard on the days I run  for warm-up instead. The next time I do this video, I will probably try the intermediate level, to see if it moves a little faster. From taking actual classes, I know modifications for most of the poses, so if she gives more difficult poses, it shouldn't pose (haha) too much of a problem.

The worst thing about the whole video was the background music. It was like circa-1990s Weather Channel music. I hated-hated-hated it. Tinkling, happy-sounding pianos--I could almost see the Doppler rader. I didn't think to look for it mid-routine, but I wonder if there's an option to turn off the music and leave the verbal instruction...I think I'll be trying a different video tomorrow rather than moving straight on to the next level of this one.

8003789,5,B0000VLKW6,"Mary is an amazing teacher who combines rigorous challenge with compasion and heart.  She has designed the video to be accessible to those new to yoga and challenging to those of us who have been practicing yoga for 10+ years.  Since she is my teacher in person as well as on the video, I can attest to her deep knowledge of the body, skill in communicating how to access the power of the poses, and her wisdom and compassion about human nature and the mind.  Whereas the poses might seem slow to those used to a different style, if you let Mary guide and challenge you, the results over time are remarkable.  Thank you Mary for your hard work, dedication, and spirit!",1319587200,,668,4.450819672131147

While the sequences that are included are excellent for stimulating metabolism and may aid with weight loss, this is a fantastic DVD for anyone interested in Iyengar yoga.  Mary Pappas-Sandonas is a teacher who brings a wonderful energy to her teaching.  Having taken her classes in person, her enthusiasm for the yoga comes through on the DVD as does her warmth and compassion. To get a sense of her approach to yoga and interest in making the DVD be sure to watch her interview before you even attempt any of the sequences.  Once you start with the different sequences you will enjoy very precise instruction.  If you can't get to a yoga class, this is the one DVD to have as it brings the class to you.  Enjoy!!!",1255737600,,759,4.463768115942029
