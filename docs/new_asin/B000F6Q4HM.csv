2553346,5,B000F6Q4HM,"I bought the Master series a few months after completing P90X by Tony Horton and Beachbody.

Typically one would do something like Power 90 (or Slim in 6), then move on to the Master Series and THEN do P90X. I had been exercising daily for over 10 years so I was able to go right into it even though I hadn't done those other Beachbody programs.

If you are out of shape, I HIGHLY recommend NOT starting with P90X (which is extremely grueling) or even the Master series. Instead I'd advise doing the original Power 90 program first or something along those lines (like the first ""Core Secrets"" workouts by Gunnar Peterson) .

 Anyway, as I was closing in on day 90 of P90X I knew I would need to find other programs that would allow me to maintain my condition while working at a lower overall level of intensity. There was no way I could keep up the P90X pace indefinitely. So I decided to get some of the original Power 90 programs (which I ordered individually via Amazon Marketplace) and then for Father's Day, a few months later, received the complete Master Series programs directly from Beachbody. My wife already had Tony's Power Half Hour programs so I figured between all of them I'd be in good shape (both figuratively and literally :)).

While I'm certainly a fan of all of Tony's programs, I would have to say that the Master Series are my overall favorites!

One of the things I love the most about all of  Tony Horton''s workouts is that they are very easy to follow since they don't have any difficult choreography. For someone like myself, who want's to work hard but doesn't want to have to memorize long movement patterns, these are perfect! In fact, some folks refer to these types of workouts as ""gym style"" and I think  that's an excellent description!

The Masters Series programs are a great balance between the intensity of P90X and Power 90. They are all under an hour long also (most P90X workouts are 60 minutes w/ the exceptions being Cardio X (45 minutes) and Yoga X (90 minutes).

 Tony Horton, for those unfamiliar with him, has a knack for creating extremely effective programs that will work you hard, but because he is such a character he makes the workouts a lot of fun to do (Yoga X is the only workout where he really seems out of his element, trying to be too serious). In the entire master series he comes across as extremely spontaneous and funny. For some folks he's too over the top, but for me it keeps things light. Considering I work out usually very early in the morning it's nice to have someone make me laugh during the workouts when I'm so dog tired :)

That's a general overview of the Master series so now I'll get more specific about Sweat 5-6 in particular:

This program follows the same format as the Sweat 1-2 and 3-4 workouts. They start with a warm up, then go to Power Yoga and then move into a series of athletic cardio moves. After those you get into a series of kickboxing type movements before the final cooldown.

One thing I particularly love about Sweat 5-6 compared to the earlier Power 90 programs is that Tony gives you a much more expanded warm up section. In the Original Power 90 workouts, due to the short warm up at the beginning, I always find that I need to use the first round of each exercise as a warm up (which I do in a much modified fashion) and then the subsequent rounds is where I amp up the intensity. With the Masters Series I find I'm so well warmed up that I can start the actual workout part of the program at full (or close to full) intensity.

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. Warm up (this heats up the body before the stretch)
2. Stretch

Yoga section with 4 sun salutations
(upward dog/downward dog/warrior one)

3. Duck and Cover (in a fighting stance, you duck down then as you come up you change position to the other side)
4. Twist and Pivot (you hold your hands as if holding a resistance ball and rotate your body from side to side)
5. Squat knee raises
REPEAT 3-5 (total of 3 times)

6. Water break

7. Groucho in a hurry (a wide stance squat position, ""walking"" quickly forwards then backwards)
8. DB Scoot (sort of like a ""Kareoka"" (not Kareoke) like you see football players do)
9. Tires on fire (another football type drill, high knees as if doing the ""tire"" drill)
REPEAT 7-9 (total of 3 times)

10. Water break

11. Jab slide uppercut
12. Low block lunge punch
13. Jump kick

REPEAT 11-13 (total of three times)

14. Cool down/Stretch

As I mentioned above, I find the Masters Workouts in general to be my favorite of Tony Horton's workouts and I really love all his programs. There is something about the whole vibe of the workouts, from Tony's demeanor, the ""students"" he chose for the workouts, the set and the music. Plus the fact that they are such a reasonable length makes them very easy to fit in most folks schedule. Also, the intensity is enough to give me a great workout without making me feel completely depleted.

I found the Power 90 Master Series DVD's and I gotta say, the 'Plyo Legs' DVD is my favorite!  Talk about a leg workout!  Love it!  The DVD is 50 minutes:  6 minute warm up, 38 minute workout, and a 6 minute cooldown.  I love that the exercises are different and not your normal squat.  I also love that Tony (the creator and instructor) has a modifier for each exercise.  You shouldn't do this DVD more than twice a week, and that's fine with me!  It's tough!",1383091200,3,560,4.2075471698113205
2553354,3,B000F6Q4HM,"I used Power 90 1/2 and 3/4 and was expecting this to be just as good or better.  The graphics weren't as good as they had a different counter on the bottom instead of on the side.  The length was 44 minutes but over 8 minutes at the beginning was warm up and stretching and then the cool down was 8 minutes which I thought was excessive.  The main exercises were a little confusing though I eventually figured them out.  I did have sweat dripping off of me at the end but it wasn't as challenging as I was expecting, probably since a lot of the time wasn't strictly on working out.",1373846400,,582,4.169642857142857

Definitely too challenging for a beginner, but if you did Power 90 or P90X this is a great workout to do once or twice a week as part of a maintenance program.

2553358,5,B000F6Q4HM,"I'm a 40 year old guy who has run intermittenly over the past decade.  Recently I completed the 13 week Power 90 program and immediately started on to the Power 90 Master Series and I thought this DVD was extremely tough.  It's about 50 minutes long starting with a warm up and then stretching followed by a series of exercises that never repeat though out the routine, ending with the cool down and stretching.  I continually struggle with my balance and many of these exercises present additional challenge because of this but I am learning to make the modifications I need to still do the exercise but not topple over and that is helping a lot.  As time goes on I have confidence that I'll get better as I get stronger but I have to say that my first crack at it had lots of time where I stood while Tony and his crew completed the exercises.  It really wore me out with a great combo of strength building and cardio.  He mentions in the beginning that this Plyo workout is very tough and he wasn't exaggerating.  I felt like this routine and his cardio interval routine are the most grueling of his cardio workouts in the Master Series.  I would be surprised if even the fittest of individuals thought this workout was a breeze.

Tony Horton does have a quirky and silly personality, but if you can't get past that to get yourself a fanatastic workout, then move on to something else.

2553362,4,B000F6Q4HM,"I've had the P90 Masters series for a few months now and I've finally committed to doing the rotation.  Sculpt 5/6 is alternated with Sweat 5/6 during the first 3 weeks of the rotation.  I will start by saying that Tony is a different kind of fitness instructor.  He's goofy, talkative, and a bit too relaxed.  This can get on your nerves until you get used to him.  Sculpt 5/6 is a full body workout that relies heavily on combination moves.  Most of the exercises are timed but there are a few with a set amount of reps.

Here's what I liked about the workout:
- Great variety of exercises that works virtually every muscle.
- Thorough warm-up and cool down.
- Tony offers great form pointers throughout the workout.  He stresses customizing the workout to your particular goals.  Heavier weight and fewer reps for strength and lighter weights with more reps for overall toning and conditioning.
-  The modifications (shown by a male and a female) for each exercise is shown at the beginning of the segment.  There are also modifications for those who prefer to use a resistance band.
-Although there is no formal chapter menu, the DVD is chaptered with each exercise having it's own chapter.  You just have to fast forward to the chapter you want.

What I didn't like so much:

- Tony's counting and cueing leaves a bit to be desired.  I think he relies on the on-screen timer a little too heavily.  He was pretty consistent with the counting on the exercises that were based on number of reps instead of number of seconds but there were very few exercises that weren't timed.  You pretty much have to do your own counting on exercises where you alternate sides.  If you rely on Tony, you'll end up uneven.
-I thought the workout was too upper body intensive. I would have preferred an even blend of upper and lower body exercises.
- No real ab workout.  You really have to concentrate on engaging your abs while doing the exercises since there is no formal ab workout at the end.
- It would be nice to have a chapter menu.
- There is a commercial for P90x and Beachbody's supplements on the DVD but at least they placed it at the end of the workout and you can fast forward through or skip over it.

2553363,5,B000F6Q4HM,"ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT BY TONY HORTON! Also ordered Trimmer Thighs. This is an amazing program. A tough work out, but Tony says to go at your own pace. Emphasizes form and safety, through which you get greater results. Tony is very professional, but FUNNY. Very challenging, but also motivating. I really like the count down clocks. The music is soft, which helps me concentrate better on form and safety. Tony takes care of business. On my first use, I was already sweating at the end of the warm up, and had to stop half way through the program, but I loved it! I can't wait to progress and to be able to complete the entire 40 minutes. I can already feel my body getting more toned. I was very impressed by the P90X infomercial and eventually want to work my way up to that one. Once I get familiar with the segments, I can mute it and turn up my stereo.
