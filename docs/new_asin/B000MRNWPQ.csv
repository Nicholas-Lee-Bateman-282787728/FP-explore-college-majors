These guys give you a peek into their dazzling world of dynamic abstract graffiti, turning abandoned surfaces, ready to be demolished, into gorgeous works of art. The DVD is a document of their work over about a five year span, covering various locations, eventually culminating in a pretty amazing gallery installation. The music that accompanies the film compliments the visuals perfectly, and the choice of electronic musicians is nothing short of stellar.

I would have given this film five stars if they went and did some more in depth interviews with the artists, and perhaps had some more special features. Maybe I'm just being picky however, since witnessing the process
of these works evolve into some amazing art is in itself very satisfying.

This film is highly recommended for graffiti and street art enthusiasts, electronic music heads, and anyone with an open mind about art and music. Let the sights and sounds speak for themselves.",1241568000,,1043,5.093567251461988
