8453362,5,B0051WTKLC,Very informative and helpful in all aspects. Easy to understand. Manual that came with the camera does not go into detail like this DVD.,1425859200,,136,4.708333333333333
8453363,5,B0051WTKLC,A great set of lessons to get you up and running with your D5300.  Went from knowing very little about DLSR photography to being able to operate my D5300 in a number of different environments.  Highly recommended if you are new to DLSR photography or the D5300.,1407024000,2,261,4.531914893617022
8453364,5,B0051WTKLC,The best course to teach you everything you need to get started with your D5300.  I wanted to move from my point and shoot to a DLSR and this book taught me everything I needed to know to get started.,1407024000,,200,4.0
8453365,4,B0051WTKLC,"This is a good quick review of the functions and operations of the D5300 and does a good job at that.  Do not expect to learn anything about photography here, just about the camera itself.
If this was priced for 1/2 of what I paid it would be 5 stars.",1391817600,5,251,4.02
