5767433,5,B00D23GQ96,"I purchased this after watching Dale Robertson in the Wells Fargo series, I enjoyed this movie for both the story and the quality of the disc for picture and sound.",1383177600,12,164,4.5
5767434,4,B00D23GQ96,"The early 1950's produced those wonderful entertaining westerns we don't see anymore. The good guys vs the bad guys and all that shoot-em-up. An early Robert Wagner is enjoyable and appealing and shows promise. Dale Robertson and Rory Calhoun, not the best actors in Hollywood, always provide the typical western hero image. It's fun.",1378512000,6,334,5.203703703703703
5767435,4,B00D23GQ96,"We hadn't seen Dale Robertson before and found him to be a good actor.  The film was a good western, very predictable and a little cheesy but a fun film.",1376352000,7,153,4.1
5767436,4,B00D23GQ96,A beautiful print of an interesting and very pleasant Western. The sequence where the three friends close in on the villian (played by John Kellogg) remains one of the best of its kind.,1372118400,14,185,4.636363636363637
8588451,5,B00D23GQ96,I really like Dale Robertson! I was very happy to see this one for the first time.,1528070400,,82,3.8823529411764706
8588452,4,B00D23GQ96,"Interesting character study of three friends who can't all agree on how to take care of stagecoach robbers and murderers. Dale Robertson and Robert Wagner are fun to watch as they both go through character changes based on their particular feeling towards the evil robbers and the rule of law. Rory Calhoun, the sheriff, moderates the movie heroes and sides with law over brute force and retribution (Dale), both trying to lead the young Wagner in their own way. Watch what Wagner does near the end!",1517961600,,499,4.813953488372093
8588453,5,B00D23GQ96,Excellent movie.  A coming-of-age story -- learning to deal with difficult choices.,1511049600,,83,5.916666666666667

8588455,5,B00D23GQ96,We always enjoy these classic westerns.,1433980800,2,39,5.666666666666667
8588456,3,B00D23GQ96,Would have preferred the film in colour. Otherwise a good film.,1405728000,,63,4.818181818181818
8588457,4,B00D23GQ96,"Almost a pre-cursor to Tales of Wells Fargo. This is another Dale Robertson movie where he portrays a good guy on the edge of bad.....but good wins over in the end even if it takes a bullet to do it :)
Rory Calhoun plays the good sheriff nd Robert Wagner the troubled youth.  An enjoyable movie.",1401148800,3,295,4.267857142857143
8588458,5,B00D23GQ96,"I'm ten minutes in and like what I see. There's not many cowboy movies that I don't like. I enjoy these old westerns (black&white) because you get to see these actors when they were young. Wagner looks to be around 23. When Dale Robinson comes into the scene I just smiled. I have Robinson's Wells Fargo series. I have come to realize the older you get the more you long for things from your past. This is turning out to be a good western. At this point only Rory Calhoun hasn't appeared. Calhoun was a western star as well. Western lovers, this is what you want. Revenge, Justice, Action!",1395187200,5,589,4.412844036697248
8588459,5,B00D23GQ96,"This western features 3 of my favorite ""cowboys"" of the fifties- Calhoun, Robertson, and Wagner.  The plot is unusual in that it makes stage drivers/shotgun guards the focus of the film whereas they are usually incidental to a broader story.  The action scenes are superbly directed and played out-the interplay between the 3 main characters is captivating- the action music is timely and adds to the excitement.  My only complaint is the ending- I was expecting more of a climax, but all in all, it's a fine addition to my collection of fifties westerns. I would equate it to ""Ambush"", ""The Gunfighter"", ""Yellow Sky"", and ""Winchester 73"", to name a few.",1394496000,10,654,4.873873873873874
8588460,5,B00D23GQ96,"Saw this one when I was about 15, and had not seen it since. But glad it came out on DVD. Still Enjoyed it as it also has 3 Great stars featured.",1387497600,8,145,3.5625
