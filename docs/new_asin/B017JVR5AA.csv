7507690,5,B017JVR5AA,"When I seen this advertised on TV I knew I had to have it. Amazon price is a tad lower. The set is wonderful and fun to watch. It brought back memories of watching Bob starting back in the 50s when TV was new. He was a terrific man and you can tell by watching these performances that he loved the servicemen.

7507692,2,B017JVR5AA,"Very disappointed!  I expected more performances.  It was more of a documentary with Bob Hope narrating where they have been, etc. etc.  A lot of very short clips.  The roast was fun but the rest of the DVDs where very boring.  I bought them to watch with my Dad but plan to return.  If they don't allow me to return, then I will sell them.",1451433600,2,340,4.153846153846154

7507695,3,B017JVR5AA,"I thought I would like this a lot more than I did.  I didn't hate it, and just seeing Bob in form again was great.  But the Bob Hope dvds themselves were a collection of short clips, most of which have been aired on the commercials.  The material seems really dated now, even to me - I'm of that age, but I honestly haven't thought about Henry Kissinger in decades.  I forgot how much of Bob's humor was political, and it just wasn't as funny as back then.  The dvd's where he's entertaining the troops were, for me, the best part.  The impact on the servicemen is still moving, and I don't think I ever gave Raquel Welch the credit she deserves!  She can't sing or dance worth a lick, but the guys just ate her up, and what a good girl she was to go out and do those shows.  Sorry, Raquel - a belated cheers to you.  I will honestly watch those over and over.  The celebrity roast was good'ish.  It's just the one, and it seemed to be really short, but all the old comedians were good to see.  The biggest reason I don't give it 5 stars is the price!  It's not even nearly worth that much.  Sorry, Bob's relatives....love Bob, but that price is ridiculous.",1451347200,19,1157,4.2

7507697,5,B017JVR5AA,"Was hoping order would include Dean Martin Roast and booklet as seen on TV offer. Was pleasantly surprised that it came included. I am writing this as I am watching. Cannot wait to give review!
If you are any kind of fan of Bob Hope DO NOT HESITATE to buy. If you get any enjoyment of old shows or series, DO NOT HESITATE.
If you enjoy timeless comedy that is clean and that you can watch with anyone in the room, DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY. You will get that same warm feeling of meeting an old good friend or in this case an old favorite show and stars of yesteryear. BOB HOPE- there will never be another. Has about 24 total hours that FLIES BY. Came on time, w/o problems. Packaging could be better- discs strapped together with plastic strap w cardboard backing. Very minor point.

7507709,3,B017JVR5AA,"I have had a ball watching this set, and I haven't even cracked open the second half which is dominated by Bob's USO and Vietman trip films.

But in the first box of DVDs at least, the editors really went to town here.  Whole musical numbers are cut from specials, walk-on music (such as Johnny Carson's theme song) is deleted and replaced with applause...huge chunks of the 90th birthday special cut because they couldn't clear clips from Hope's movies, or didn't bother to try.  Overall, just a lot of edits, and clumsy ones at that.

If this wasn't a Time Life release I'd be less disappointed, but they've had a fairly strong track record with their Carol Burnett releases.  For a fairly minor example, the Burnett ""Lost Episodes"" release features ""brought to you by"" sponsor bumpers on many episodes, something I find historically enjoyable.  All of the sponsor credits are cut from the Hope specials. despite the fact that he only had two sponsors for decades--Chrysler and Texaco, and he makes jokes about them by name in his monologues!

Despite all of this, the box set is worth getting.  A few of these specials have been in collector's circle...some of this material is repeated from previous Hope DVD sets...but there's still a lot of great ""new"" stuff here for fans of classic variety television.  Thanks for the memories Time Life...better luck getting them uncut next time.....",1449964800,25,1392,4.864406779661017
