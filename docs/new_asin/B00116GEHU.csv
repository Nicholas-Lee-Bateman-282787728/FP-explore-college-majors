3061468,3,B00116GEHU,"When I watched this movie, I was already forewarned how bad others think this movie is from the trailer was released until the time I watched it.

The movie tries so much as to re-vision the original Day of The Dead and incorporate the added thrills of 28 Days Later and the Dawn of The Dead remake. It would've been an okay movie if not for the gimics they put in to try add the scariness factor of the movie, instead of being scary it ended up weird.

In my opinion, it's not as bad as many zombie movies out there. Though, I prefer not to categorize this movie as a zombie flick, since it's more like a viral frenzy thing like that of 28 days and 28 weeks later. I must say that this movie is far better than what Uwe Boll could come up with, and the likes of Day of The Dead 2 and Return of The Living Dead 4 & 5.

It would've been a decent film if not for the wall crawling bit. Probably these were unused shots from Spiderman and Aliens films (those scenes would be great if they made a marvel zombies film on spiderman). It still boggles me how a legless zombie could leap so high.

The CGI of the movie was poorly done and the movie could be better without it. With proper angles and suggestive measures the scenes will be a lot better without involving the CGI bit.

The last 5 seconds of the movie is so corny kind of 70s TV horror shows that the filmakers try very hard for one last scare. It's so obvious and really degrades the movie.

The DVD covers should be replaced by the first poster released early 2007 though it's very clearly seen that the design was a rip off from Land of the Dead, it's still better than what is now being sold to the public. Honestly, the cover depicts on how the critics would rate this film and how many customers might feel after watching it.

If they only stuck with George Romero's formula it would've been an okay film.",1205452800,4,1867,4.183844011142061
3061469,1,B00116GEHU,"You knew it was coming.  After the surprise success of Zack Snyder's surprisingly good Dawn of the Dead remake, a remake of Day of the Dead didn't seem all that far off from happening.  Well, now it's here, and it is indeed an awful, needless remake of George Romero's flawed 1985 classic.  The zombie outbreak is caused by a virus that gets passed around like a cold, which is a nice twist in itself, but really doesn't get used to its full potential.  The zombies themselves do all kinds of crazy things, from crawling on walls and ceilings to leaping around like Spider-Man.  It should be noted that Day of the Dead isn't scary one bit either, and a majority of the gore effects (mainly the CGI head shots) are pretty bad, and the acting (from Ving Rhames, who is not reprising his role from the Dawn of the Dead remake, as well as Mena Suvari and a barely watchable and annoying Nick Cannon) is atrocious.  There was potential here, with veteran horror director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2 & 3, Halloween H20) and writer Jeffrey Reddick (the Final Destination films) at the helm, but alas, Day of the Dead is an awful zombie remake that is a waste of film more than anything else.  Alll in all, if you're a fan of the original or in zombie fans in general, you'll probably check out the Day of the Dead remake regardless, but don't say you weren't warned.",1205452800,39,1362,4.445783132530121
3061470,1,B00116GEHU,"I love zombie movies for some reason.  The remake of Dawn of the Dead is one of the better zombie movies to have come out in quite a while, so I had high expectations for this movie.  Unfortunately this is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen.  There is no script whatsoever, the zombies are pretty much super human (run 30 mph, scale walls, run on the ceiling, etc.) but when the main characters need to get away somehow the zombies become slow, dim-witted morons again.  The dialog is terrible; the whole movie is just plain awful.  Avoid this movie like the plague; it is flat out terrible.",1204675200,6,602,4.4363636363636365
3061471,1,B00116GEHU,I love the George Romero movies and was hoping it would be an updated version of the original. I was very disappointed to find it was nothing like the Romero film and was very poorly made overall. I hope you don't waste your time like I did.,1204243200,4,241,4.148936170212766
3061472,1,B00116GEHU,"With all the money that is spent on these flicks, why can't they get a decent writer, a good director and some talented unknown actors??

Is it because Romero or the various producers really enjoys abusing the fans with the same tired plots?  Gee...give us more close ups of the dead biting folks..yeah!  And the human whose decides to endanger the remainder of humanity by his greed.

Is it because the studios don't care what's written?  They get better stories and scripts from the fans that the hacks they hire.  Do they really pay ""professionals "" for this?

I've only seen the trailer and I know the story.

I wish some studio would make a Dead movie where survival IS the story and the dead ARE the plot complication.  Forget the social commentary for a change.",1203984000,2,768,4.588235294117647

3061474,4,B00116GEHU,"If you watch this movie with an open mind, and not as a remake, you will enjoy it for what it is- A pretty high budget film with fast, vicious zombies, and loads of fun.

There are a lot of things that I liked about this film, and for starters, It has Ving Rhames ( who among many other roles, also played in Pulp Fiction, and Dawn of the Dead remake.)
I just love anything he is in.

 There was PLENTY of gore and action, and tons of heart stopping edge of your seat moments to keep any horror fan interested.
The makeup of the zombies, and the special FX were top notch, too.

Also, the film takes place at the beginning of the outbreak,so we get to see the zombies over running the city, emergency rooms, streets, etc.
That is one thing I did NOT like about the original- The lack of ACTION.The entire movie was filmed in a dank and dark tunnel, which was...just a bit TOO depressing to me. This movie shows the undead take over on a much larger scale, and once again, I like that ACTION.

You just have to seperate it from the original, because it is very different than the original.
I actually liked this better, and I am a big Romero fan. I just think this had a lot of really fresh stuff in it, and was way more action than the original one.",1203292800,6,1249,4.144628099173554
3061475,1,B00116GEHU,"I'm more than likely the biggest horror movie fan on the planet, but this is just totally ridiculous! Zero attempt at a script, terrible acting and zombies that scale the walls as if they were half spiderman.. What am I supposed to get out of this??? This isn't even good enough to be a cheesy B movie! Let me spell it out for you... Not only is this movie an insult to your intelligence, but it shows the decline of western civilization in movie making as we know it. Enough said!",1202860800,7,481,4.2967032967032965
3061476,1,B00116GEHU,"I can't begin writing this review claiming to be a fan of the original film which I liked, not loved. But I can honestly say the most revolting portion of this film was the time I wasted watching it. Nothing happens until twenty-four minutes into the film.

You die, suddenly you look like you've just risen after a ten year slumber. Batman can't climb on ceilings, but you can as a zombie. The Flash can barely keep up with a zombie. Bodies are stashed in closets by ingenious zombies. All in all, Dean Cane's zombie soldier movie sucked but rivaled this monstrousity.",1202688000,4,569,4.578431372549019
3061477,4,B00116GEHU,"Let me just say right up front I went into watching this movie expecting to hate it after reading all the other bad reviews around the net.  I'm a loyal & avid fan of the original & love all of Romero's other ""Dead"" work (the original ""Dawn"" probably being my favorite).  To my utter shock this movie actually wasn't that bad.  Granted this movie was definately not without it's faults, but at least a rental is definately warranted.  Much like the case of the ""Dawn"" remake, had they just called this something else I think this would've gone over alot better.  The movie only loosely has anything at all to do with the original & even than you don't see it until the very end of the movie.  I'm not gonna go into plot really as not to spoil anything for you,

Now for some of the things that bothered me about the movie:

A) The ""outbreak"" comes from a virus that people catch like a cold.
B) This movie unlike the original takes place at the beginning of the outbreak, seems to only last about a day, & seems to only effect this one small Colorado town.
C) Zombies crawling on ceilings is a little ridiculous
D) The cover of the film shows a zombie vomiting, no where in the film does this happen.  It's a stupid cover for a film that people are already expecting to hate; why not dress it up a little & spark some interest
E) I hated the way the zombies change, one second they're perfectly normal & normal looking, the next they're blistery, open soared & rotten looking
F) I hated the amature hour CGI used for alot of the head shots, it reminded me alot of ""Wild Zero"".  While that movie was great, their film was meant to be silly.
G) It was really stupid that zombies hide their victims, A) Why do zombies care who finds them? B)Why didn't these corpses zombify?  Stupid, stupid!!

Now for some of the things I liked about the movie:

A) You get the same fast paced zombies like in the remade ""Dawn"", these ones seem alot more vicious & energetic though
B) For the most part I liked the cast (even Nick Cannon)
C) The story wasn't horrible, just watch it as a zombie movie & not as a ""Day Of The Dead"" remake (which isn't all that hard to do cause they're really not all that similar).
D) Other than the CGI work the film seemed to've had a decent budget, the practical effects were all great, pretty much the only thing you have to worry about being in CGI is blood spray, head shots, oh ya & fire.  The fire scenes are worse than the head shot scenes (just an FYI)

In the end, just go into this expecting to hate it (the cover helps) & you might actually get a kick out of it.  I actually don't regret watching it.  Just watch the movie for what it is.  It's no ""Shaun"", ""Dawn"", or ""Land"", but it's definately far better than ""House Of The Dead 1&2"", ""Day 2-Contagion"", or ""Return 4&5"".  Really though after looking at what I just wrote that's still not saying much.",1200355200,32,2878,4.276752767527675

3061572,1,B00116GEHU,"Say what you want about Romero's own Dead efforts post-Day--Land of the Dead, Diary, Survival--at least he wants to extend our thinking about zombies, which is to say extend our understanding of ourselves. Land was weak in delivery but had had good comments on class. And while the reboot of Night of the Living Dead did well to correct the original's horribly weak female protagonist and offer a nicely thoughtful end on humans being the real monsters, but after that, the trilogy reboots have proven more and more vapid.

Spoilers ahead.

Culminating in this one, made probably more out of obligation, connections to the original about as superficial as they come--there's a bunker, there's a soldier named Bud who retains some of his soldier instincts after turning...and that about covers it. Somehow, the zombie virus is explosive when exposed to flame, and the creatures a little more vampiric or troglodyte in demeanor. Appreciated that this contributes a kick-ass woman to film history, though it resorts to the typical ethnic witty sidekick, but besides speeding up the zombies, which is nothing new either, expect this to offer nothing new, even down to the final scare attempt...yawn.",1460851200,,1195,5.123076923076923

This is not on the level of it's predecessor, the original George Romero film of the same title, but I found it quite enjoyable. First, let me say that I'm an avid fan of the George Romero zombie films. I saw the first one at a drive-in theater when I was a teen. If not for Mr. Romero, there would be no flesh-eating zombie genre... no 'Walking Dead' books or television series... makes me shudder to think about it. Should George Romero be deified? ...Probably.
But this is also a good thrilling movie. If you're a fan of lots of action, it's pretty much non-stop after the first twenty-five minutes. Good special effects. Fast moving zombies. One even races across the ceiling tiles to snatch his prey! This isn't decaying corpses rising from graves, but a virus created by some military scientists who eventually fall victim to their own folly.
If you're a George Romero purist, then you'll probably turn your nose up at this one, but if you've somehow acclimated yourself to the fast moving variety of zombie as I have, then you should enjoy this film.",1427846400,,1212,4.641860465116279

It starts incredibly slow then abruptly erupts into full scale panic with incredibly acrobatic zombies scuttling across ceilings and whatnot.  The dialog is hopeless, the situation is downright silly, the acting inconsistent (to say the least).  The story is careful to avoid explanation; vague references are made to a Project Wildfire and biochemical research.  The usual culprits in stories like this.  When all else fails, blame the military and the government.  Of course, there's a claim of natural immunity to explain the survivors who aren't bitten and not infected.  There's also a super-zombie who doesn't appear until too late in the mangled mayhem of the story (that at least might have proven interesting but not much is made of him or his prowess).  This movie shows some promise but has so little finesse going for it that it's an almost pointless gesture.  Still.  For all its many flaws, I still like this hopeless mess.

3061740,2,B00116GEHU,"I enjoy a good zombie flick, but I am by no means a connoisseur of the genre. Regardless of my expertise (or lack thereof), though, Day of the Dead leaves a lot to be desired on all fronts.

First and most important, if you're in search of the Romero film by the same name you can stop reading now, because this isn't it. The similarities between that film and this one begin and end with the title and a couple of shared minor characters. Second, the acting is about as good as the script allows: pleasantly average at best and highly unimaginative and/or cheesy at worst. Third, the plot is as straightforward as they come (kill the zombies), and Day of the Dead fails every time it tries to inject any depth into the story (like character development or the backstory between the lead and her brother).

The biggest drawback for me with this rendition of Day of the Dead is the zombies themselves. I'm something of an elitist when it comes to monster movies; I prefer my vampires to hail from Eastern Europe and be afraid of the light, I want my werewolves vulnerable only to silver bullets, and I like my zombies to be slow, mindless automatons motivated solely by the desire to taste human flesh. The zombies in Day of the Dead do not fit these criteria.

Early in the film, the zombies bounce off the walls everywhere the main characters look. They move incredibly fast, they crawl on ceilings, and they can jump out of third story windows and sprint around without missing a beat. Without any explanation whatsoever, these same zombies are limited to running around at the pace of a quick jog for the entire second half of the film. Worse yet, some zombies demonstrate intelligence, others fire guns (?), and one retains about 50% of his human characteristics and never tries to eat anyone. Another zombie eats part of his own face. Yet another of the creatures passes up a tasty human meal to, again, eat/kill another zombie. My list of complaints goes on, but you get the idea.

I tend to reserve one-star ratings for real bowel-dwellers, only the worst of the worst. While Day of the Dead is above that stature, it also gets worse as it progresses. The dialogue is monotonous and boring, and the ridiculous, eye-roll-inducing finale is frustratingly unoriginal. If you don't enjoy the first half hour of Day of the Dead, you'll hate the rest. My advice is not to waste your time on any of it.",1387065600,,2402,4.579069767441861

I was wrong.

It HAS some redeeming qualities.

Have to admit that I enjoyed the fact that Ving Rhames has a lesser role and Mena & AnnaLynne have stronger ones.

They are still working at it, for sure, but it was especially nice to see Mena *try* to play hard-a**.

She pulls some of it off and some not.

And, yes, the cinematography is *abominable* in several scenes. (even watching in complete darkness, no lights, on my big-a** TV I could hardly make out anything)

DAY OF THE DEAD finds a struggling group of civilians, scientists, and military personnel facing off with a deadly disease that turns its victims into ravenous flesh-eating monsters! The pedestrian script is so deeply embedded in genre cliches that they need not be listed. It is poorly written and poorly acted, despite the re-casting of DAWN OF THE DEAD's Ving Rhames as Captain Rhodes in addition to other recognizable names like Mena Suvari, Nick Cannon, and television's AnnaLynne McCord. Taking the new breed of zombies a step further, Steve Miner's monsters can not only run, but can leap small buildings in a single bound and inexplicably climb the walls and ceilings. The silliness quickly grows out of hand, but this remake sure does pack in a ton of blood! As gory as it is genuinely idiotic, DAY OF THE DEAD somehow manages to retain interest, but only for the good old fashioned Splatter fans. It is best to just forget that this film was even made, and move on to the countless other zombie films that followed in DAWN OF THE DEAD's wake.

Well, awful doesn't begin to describe it and one star is way too generous for this remake - which isn't really a remake. This is a clumsy and feeble ""reimagined"" version of the George Romero classic. Believe me, I sat through plenty of clunker horror films in my time, but this is nearly unwatchable.

On paper, the cast looks promising, but I can't help but say: Ving Rhames and Mena Suvari - really?!? Shame on you. If you take the shameful acting, lousy script, terrible story, godawful makeup, ridiculous effects, and gross misuse of a classic horror film title off the table and concentrate only on the horror aspect of film, it stands as possibly the worst zombie genre film ever made. According to this ""reimagining,"" dying a horrible death (which this movie should have done) heightens one's strength, speed and wall/ceiling-climbing abilities. The film's effects team (a term I use loosely) jerkily accelerate the speed the film in order to make the zombies appear to move with superhuman quickness. The effect is painfully obvious and only causes the viewer to regret choosing to watch this atrocity. Sadly, the living are even less realistic than the undead. Suvari portrays (again, loose term) a tough-as-nails officer in the armed forces who doesn't carry a loaded gun. Um, hello?!? Zombies!

Acting? It's OK. Nothing special. No one walked away with any awards fr their parts played.

Still it has alot of good points to it. If this were a effort that had nothing to do with that movie I would have said average three star  low budget zombie flick! But this one was made in probably Romania or someplace and it has zombies that mutate into cieling crawling things and explode when on fire. In other words it has it's own zombie mythos. It shouid have been called 'jumping zombies' in fact this is similiar to planet terror in that it's funny in a way but this one wasn't trying to be, with it's jumping zombies. It's ok though with decent acting from the main actors who have all been around for years. Mena S. deserves to be in a better horror moive than this though, she's got real acting chops.  IN fact you can't fault any actor for this movie. Most horror movies are low budget and well you can't even use the same rating system that regular movies get probably.  This one though has a flat looking blu ray transfer that you usually see on older movies from the 80's. they would have to restore those to make them look better, and this is a newer movie!  The effects are low budget and that's ok though because this is a low budger flick. But alot higher than many zombie flicks out there that I enjoy! It's just saying it's inspired by Romero that pulls this down. However it's watchable for zombie fans and lets face it , it's not as bad as lots of other even lower budget zombie fests out there.  I would say it's a average zombie flick and leave it at that. the transfer is just the dvd one stuck on blu ray though which is wrong. it will still look better but common.",1294617600,,1732,4.284403669724771
3061877,3,B00116GEHU,"The truth is, Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" is arguably the weakest of Romero's zombie films. Romero had a much grander vision for ""Day of the Dead,"" but he would not agree to toning down the film's gore to achieve an ""R"" rating.

The result was  a hastily re-written script, a plodding pace, and a generally lackluster film.  The music of Romero's ""Day"" is also quite dull, especially compared to the music of its predecessor ""Dawn of the Dead.""

So in many ways, Romero's film was problematic in its own right; it lacked much of humor, depth and social commentary that made its predecessor great.

To those of you who say that this ""isn't like Romero's version,"" I say well, so what?

 Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" does not deserve the same reverence that ""Dawn"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" deserve. It's not a great film and it's hardly a 'horror classic' in the same way that it's two predecessors are.

In some ways, this newer Day of the Dead  improves upon Romero's. The dreary, lackluster salt mines of the original film are replaced with more diverse settings. The zombies are faster, stronger, and more interesting.

This 2008 film is not great either, which is the main similarity to Romero's film. It's a passable, if somewhat mediocre Zombie film, just like Romero's original.  While very different in terms of plot, they are alike in the sense that they could have used something extra.

3061900,2,B00116GEHU,"Few things irk me more than a movie with a ridiculously implausible military presence.  If there were a massive quarantine effort or a cover-up of a zombie outbreak in Leadville, CO, surely there wouldn't be privates calling corporals ""ma'am,"" and there is no way the entire effort would not be led by a Captain.  This is all unacceptable considering a fresh out of Basic Training Private would know better.

Speaking of that, Captain Black Earlydeath (Ving Rhames) is put in charge of a massive quarantine effort when there is a mysterious outbreak with flu-like symptoms.  His top assistant is Corporal Powertrip (Mena Suvari), who walks around with the power and sense of entitlement of someone who has not been in the service less than three years.  It's up to them and two newbies - Private Irritating (Nick Cannon) and Private Zombie (Stark Sands) - to band together for survival.

The problem with their plan is that the zombies in this movie can think and reason, use tools, and walk on ceilings.  Good thing the local gun store is completely empty, RIGHT AFTER a zombie outbreak.  It's also fortunate that Private Zombie has not only switched sides (from Z to human), but he's also brainlessly reliable enough to walk trail when the group goes on patrol.  Because he's in love with Suvari.  Seriously.  And that's just the beginning of the logical inconsistencies in this slap in the face to the zombie genre.

The major flaw (of which there are many) with this movie is that not a single character is likeable.  I wanted them all to die.  Suvari, who is rarely likeable, is inserted just for the clichd ""tough girl in charge""-routine, and Cannon signed up so he could do all the scenes he thinks are cool (e.g. two handguns pointed in different directions).  Aside from the previously mentioned ceiling crawl, ala The Grudge, these zombies blow up like charcoal briquettes when they encounter flames.  Zombie vampires?  The major positive is the gore, blood spatter, etc.  The content will satisfy most gorehounds.

Point blank, this movie sucks.  It would have been better if Ving Rhames survived and Mena Suvari was torn apart until there was nothing but viscera and arm-kebabs for the hungry zombies.  This is a disgrace and should have never been allowed to carry a Romero title.

The slow scenes, needed to build plot, were done well as they were aptly inter-spaced with action scenes. I broke out the popcorn waiting for a modern zombie classic to unfold. It never did.

3061906,2,B00116GEHU,"It was only inevitable. Someday, somebody somewhere would remake the third film in the legendary zombie saga helmed by George A. Romero. First, there was Tom Savini's directorial debut with a remake of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>,"" which was a load of nostalgic fun for genre fans. Then, Zack Snyder spun the genre on its head with his ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002ABURA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>"" remake that helped usher in a new generation of zombie flicks (as well as a long-awaited return to the genre from Romero himself in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Dead/dp/B000B2YR7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Dead</a>"") and now here we are, for better or for worse, with an update of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead</a>"".

Unfortunately, it's for the worse. Director Steve Miner, who himself has a respectable track record with films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-H20/dp/6305291446/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween H20</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House/dp/B000069HP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House</a>,"" seemed like an okay choice for the job, yet the end result is a film that is sloppy and unprofessional on nearly each and every front. In this version of the film, the military -- which includes Mena Suvari in a career-killing role sporting unflattering fatigues -- is brought in to quarantine a small town after an outbreak spread by a common cold is turning its citizens into the living dead. Along for the ride are Ving Rhames -- not reprising his role from the ""Dawn of the Dead"" -- and Nick Cannon, as a wise-cracking, albeit, irritating force to be reckoned with.

The film was originally intended for theatrical release but was shelved for a few years before seeing the light of day, and it's easy to see why after witnessing the mess that it truly is. The CGI is downright awful, and is rivaled only by the pathetic excuse for acting from Cannon and some of the lesser known actors who portray the teenagers. There are some twists on the original that, while hardly effective, are at least admirable. Bub, the loveable zombie from Romero's original, is transformed into Bud, a love-struck vegetarian zombie. Unfortunately, this whole bit is so silly you can almost hear the sound of palms hitting faces behind the scenes. To his credit, Miner puts on a fast-paced show that keeps the pain to a minimum. At the very least, zombie fans will find some cheap thrills in this ""Day of the Dead"" redux, but serious horror fans and George A.

3061939,1,B00116GEHU,"Since Dawn of The Dead was also remade, it seems like studios are quick to cash in on the ""zombie"" phenomenom.  Yes, you can make vague comments about materialism and ""so what"" if this isn't ground that has been trod before.

Sure, the zombies move faster and the ""shock"" factor is more constant and is no longer juxtaposed against calm suburban life.  That, of course, isn't why this film deserves, well ""negative stars"".

It's a remake made by someone who apparently did not even watch the original.  Really.

In the original film, the zombie attack has already happened and soldiers and scientists have holed up in a military base where they perform experiments on the zombies.  There is no ""shots of the outbreak"" as the whole point of the film is entirely different.  It's more about tensions between the characters, with most of the action happening at the tail of the film.

This is not that film, this isn't even the same story.

Instead, it starts off in ""Leadville, Colorado"" (which is actually shot in Bulgaria and LA... it looks nothing like Leadville) where the outbreak starts and, in a fairly made for television fashion, soldiers quarantine the town and zombieness ensues.  It's shot at the level of a SciFi channel original (which, let's be fair, might have better acting) and it should have surprised no one that this film went the ""straight to dvd"" route.  Mena Suvari does a poor job of playing a soldier, instead she just seems to have stumbled into a set of fatigues.  Nick Cannon takes a turn that, while a complete stretch for an actor of his versatility, really doesn't fit with the movie (he plays a teenager playing at soldier, who uses gangster slang and seems to enjoy guns too much to actually be a professional soldier).  Ving Rhames has a very brief stint as a ""hard nose"" captain, and let's be honest, he's playing ""Ving Rhames"" (let's call a spade a spade) so in his ""Ving Rhamesy"" role he does a good job.  If you like Ving Rhames.

I'd warn you that I'm about to hit ""spoiler county"", but you can probably guess the plot from here: it's a military experiment gone wrong, and as they learn this, some folks die.  Yup.  Again, this has nothing to do with the original, at all, (in which they were experimenting with zombies but did not ""make the virus"").  Run from zombies who move awfully fast, toss in some nonsensical CGI, cop your lighting style from ""Planet Terror"" and call it a day.

Really, if you are a fan of the original Romero movies and even vaguely recall the original (maybe you saw it on television) you can recognize this for what it is: horrible, horrible, horrible.  Everyone involve should be forced to wear a scarlet letter (in this case an F for fraud), because they failed the first lesson of a remake: watch the original film.

I have seen the worst of the worst when it comes to Zombie flicks as I am a huge fan. Just as an idea, House of the Dead is, in my opinion, the absolute worst Zombie film ever. Why? Heavy duty budget and not even a small bit of the film looks like it was spent on the movie itself. Plain and simeple. Now, taking that logic, let's look at this train wreck of a film.

First of all, the characters in this film have the names of the characters from the original, and that is about where the similarities between the films stop. I so wanted this to be a good film. The ""Remake"" of Dawn of the Dead, while not really a remake, was at least okay to call Dawn of the Dead as it at least had the idea of the film taking place in a mall surrounded by Zombies and a group of people trying to survive a Hellish Zombie outbreak. As for this piece of crap, the only part of the film that takes place underground, supposedly, is the very end. Sarah is now an Army recruit, Dr. Logan, nicknamed ""Frankenstein"" in the original, is now a serious bad guy, Bub is also a member of the army who becomes a Zombie but will listen to Sarah because he is in love with her(?), and lastly, let's get to Rhodes. In the original film, you hated him. Joseph Pilato made himself a cult icon in horror for his portrayal of Captain Rhodes. His sharp tonged lashings and over the top paranoia made him the real bad guy in the film. His insanity was scarier than the Zombies this group of Scientists and Army outfit were trying to survive. Ving Rhames as Rhodes is horrid. I am sure it has nothing to do with him as an actor as he has been damn good in everything else he has been in, but this script so waters down this character, you really don't know what a jerk he was in the original.

The great things about the George Romero Zombie films is that the Zombies are not the center of the story, the people in the situation they are in are. I do have respect for Steve Miner in some regards as I am a huge fan of his film ""House"" but he really should have done something else with this film. The story is weak and ill conceived along with the dialogue, the acting is just bad, the special effects are not the greatest, and the zombies themselves are just rotten, and not in a good Zombie flick kind of way either.

3061943,3,B00116GEHU,"A strange flu outbreak.

Nose bleeds.

Death.

Rebirth . . . in rage.

No one knows how anyone got sick . . . at least, no one is telling us. The US Army is all over it, quarantining Leadville, Colorado. Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) is serving her country and is part of the troops bordering the town.

Except they can't contain the rage-filled maniacs that have returned from the dead after being killed by the flu.

Going back for her mother (Linda Marlowe), she runs into her brother, Trevor (Michael Welch), and tries and save their mother's life. Unfortunately, the mom falls victim to the virus and Sarah and her brother--along with his girlfriend/female interest, Nina (AnnaLynne McCord), and a couple of Army Joes--try and flee from the ever-escalating attack of flesh-hungry zombies that stop at nothing to satisfy their gut-munching desires.

Adding a strange twist to things, one of the army chaps, Bud Crain (Stark Sands), gets infected and later transforms into an angry zombie as well, but Sarah keeps him along for the ride, feeling sorry for him. Besides, he seems harmless enough and hasn't attacked them.

When their hope of escape falls through, Sarah and the others must make their last stand against the undead before they are ripped to pieces.

Can they survive this Day of the Dead?

The first thing that comes to mind about this movie is that it's hardcore. The zombies in this flick aren't just your average gray-skinned, baggy-eyed monsters. The person infected dies then are suddenly transformed into pale-skinned, decayed-fleshed, white-eyed beasties loaded with so much rage that hate and hunger emanates from them before they even move in for the kill. Speaking of which, they move so fast you'd think they're part vampire or something. Crazy speed with these guys and, for me, those quick, jerky movements of the undead creep me out every time.

The story's simple: an outbreak, people turn into zombies, folks run for their lives. Hey, standard zombie fare, and that's part of the fun. I also liked having a female in the lead and it was neat to see Mena Suvari--who usually plays the fun, get-along girl--take charge and blast the heads off these creatures.

I was totally into this flick. The suspense was building. Every time a zombie jumped out I was jumping on my couch. All good.

Then Bud died, came back--and was nice? This bit took me out of the movie and it's why I'm giving this a 3 out of 5 instead of a 4 like I was going to. It just totally ruined it for me, especially when Sarah and friends were riding with him in the Humvee and, after a short debate about why this zombie was riding with them, they all seemed pretty cool with it.

Bud's bit at the end was also predictable, but, hey, what're you gonna do?

I did like how vulnerable these zombies were to fire and how quickly the flames destroyed them.

The ending director Steve Miner chose for this flick was the better of the two as the alternate ending on the DVD, though very similar, wasn't as strong and was a bit hokey. Having Salazar (Nick Cannon) die was the best choice.

If you like your zombie flicks raunchy, quick and gory, you'll love this Day of the Dead remake. If you're one of those folks who are sticky about story plausibility--even in the realm of zombie movies--then this probably won't be up your alley.

This film, if you can call it that, belongs somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. It's just that bad. Ving Rhames' character as the infamous Capt. Rhodes was short-lived and he went down in a crowd of zombies without a fight or awesome last words. He was just dragged off into another room and that was the end.

The zombies are terrible, I mean absolutely horrendous in the makeup department. They looked like someone threw up acrylic paint and dumped it on 300 extras, then added some latex for effect. What really took the cake was how the zombies could do an acrobatic leap off a ten story building and not splatter, or crawl on a roof like some human-cheetah-spider-gecko hybrid make it totally lame.

The dialogue is trite and hackneyed, the typical teenagers making out in the woods and killed marks the beginning and the rest looks like a bad made for Sci-Fi movie. More than anything, the film insults the viewers at every corner. Sadly, it's just an excuse for Nick Cannon to shoot his mouth of every five minutes to the point you cheer when the zombies get him.

The sad excuse for a ""trained zombie"" here aptly named Bud (they can't use BUB because they'd get sued by Romero), doesn't eat people because he's a vegetarian zombie (?????).

The story makes no sense at all just the same. One of the most ridiculous scares in movie history occurs when the soldiers enter a trailer. The overused disheveled appearance and blood streaks indicate violence of some nature all the way to the bedroom and end at strategically placed comforter on the floor. They turn it over expecting, wait for it..., nothing to jump out. The other soldier still manages to freak and bump some curtains behind, through which two severely mangled bodies are mysteriously standing up straight to fall out on him (?).

Worse, police officers show up randomly and find three bodies(?) this time then, wait for it, the power suddenly goes out to the whole town. Then a zombie mircalously jumps out of the dark and manages to take out four very well armed men without taking a bullet.(?)

Confused yet? Well it gets worse. The moment the power goes out, the worker (who is for some unknown reason still working on the place after dark) see some ""shadows"" walk out of the dark. The worker begins talking to them and the zombies jump on her, sending her into a strategically placed electrode thingy on the floor. Her blood suddenly shorts it out and all the power to town goes out(?).

To make matters worse, the zombies go from normal to super rotten in just under five seconds. If a body decayed that fast, they would be stumbling not running an Olympic Marathon to kill someone.

Then for some reason the scientist who created the zombie virus is that tall guy from the early seasons of Mad TV, you know that guy that played Stan the Java Man with his eyes bugging out and permanently whipped up on caffeine. Yeah I started laughing when he changed into a zombie... wait I thought was trying to be serious.

Then it ends with that classic all is well endings, and zombie suddenly jumps at the camera to get in that ""Oh S---"" scare at the end. Yeah, I was ready to put more holes in my wall than the Dawn of the Dead Remake I busted by guitar getting excited over.

With this movie, all bets are off at owning or even viewing it. Next time block the channel it's playing on to keep from destroying your eyes, should you happen across it late in the wee hours of the morning when nothing else is good on. Better yet, when you see it, turn off the TV and go to bed. You're better off saving that hour or so of your time.",1262044800,10,3874,4.449929478138223
3061945,1,B00116GEHU,"Sadly, I cannot call this the worst zombie movie made in the last ten years. It's sad because there are even worse movies than this one out there. ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Dead and Deader"" come to mind as examples. Other than these two, I have a difficult time thinking of a single zombie movie that this is better than.

The only thing going for this rendition of ""Day of the Dead"" is that in contrast to its teen-movie alumni cast, this is not rated PG-13. While it's not a hard-R, there are plentiful applications of the 'F' word and an equal amount of gore. No nudity, however. Perhaps the star of ""Day of the Dead"" felt she had crossed that hurdle once and for all in ""American Beauty.""

Ving Rhames took the money and got out off-camera quickly. I recommend you save the money and avoid this ""Day of the Dead"" altogether.",1261526400,,827,4.363636363636363

3061978,1,B00116GEHU,"The best thing about ""Day of the Dead"" (2008) is its short running time. It is only 86 minutes. The 86 minutes of your life will be wasted, though.

People living in a small Colorado town are infected with an unknown disease, which turn them into flesh-eating zombies. The generic story doesn't even bother to explain to us why certain characters are immune to the deadly airborne disease, but never mind. This is the town where a soldier named Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) is born and raised, and Sarah, sent there to quarantine the town, visits her home to discover that the situation is worse than she expected.

The story is nothing special, an average one. Strangely, though the new film uses the name of George A. Romero's film of the same name made in 1985 (his name is credited in the opening), the storyline is completely different, as you may have noticed, except some key elements. But the difference doesn't end there, as zombies in the new ""DODD"" can not only run; they are also capable of using weapons, jumping from upstairs window and crawling on the ceiling like a lizard. So, what is the point of using Romero's name?

The film is fast-paced, but it has no rhythm. Actions are weak and shoddily edited. Things don't get better with the wooden acting from the stars (including Nick Cannon and a short cameo by Ving Rhames) and the bland direction of Steve Miner (""Lake Placid"") and his shaky camera. Even the character of ""Bud, who could have been much more interesting, failed to impress us, as he is not given a chance to show what he can do.

Forget about this pointless ""remake"" of ""Day of the Dead."" Thankfully it is short, but is still a waste of your time.",1254096000,,1678,4.5647840531561465
3061979,4,B00116GEHU,"OK so I saw the new Day of the Dead movie and the first time I saw it, I really thought it sucked. I was like what does this movie have to do with the original??? Then I watched the original again and after that I watched the re-imagining another time and the second time I saw it I loved it! The original is a little too slow and boring for me now days, I use to like it when I was younger, but now when I see the old one I keep catching myself thinking ""when the hell is something gonna happen""?
The new re-imagining of the movie is the total opposite and is filled with action and the newer ""fast zombies"" which can run, jump and all that good stuff and yeah it is intense... I read a few reviews about somebody said ""Zombies can't shoot guns and they can't think at all"" or something and that was one of their complaints about the movie.. Well if they really think that, I think they should take another look at George Romero's original Day of the Dead, because the zombie ""Bub"" actually is learning how to do things and he also does shoot a gun in that movie. The same thing happens once again in Land of the dead, so the argument that zombies can't do any of that is just stupid.
Anyway back to this movie... If you want to watch a zombie movie that is intense and has a lot of action and that really will keep you at the edge of your seat, then watch Day of the Dead. It's a good movie, but when you watch it you have to keep an open mind and not think too much about the original. Just take it for what it is and it will be very entertaining. It's not as good as the re imagining of Dawn of the dead, but it still does a great job on keeping you entertained!

3061983,1,B00116GEHU,"Oooof! This lousy flick was like a sucker-punch to the kidneys! I just don't get how this movie turned out so lousy?! In this supposed update of Romero's third ""Dead"" movie, nothing works, and that really suprised me. First of all you have Steve Miner helming the film, and he's no slouch in pulling off a great horror sequel (Friday the 13th 2 & 3, Halloween H20), and he's working with some top tier actors as well, Ving Rhames and Mean Suvari. And to top if off, ""Day of the Dead"" is probably the weakest of Romero's original ""Dead"" films, and could have easily been remade in better fashion.
Instead we are stuck with this thing...oh, and ""Day of the Dead 2: Contagion"" which was awful, but excusable considering it had no budget, not studio, no named stars or decent effects. This ""Day of the Dead"" had no excuse for being this awful.
The basic storyline is that a small town is quarantined as a strange epidemic begins sweeping the country. The dead are returning to life and eating the living. Rhames basically gets an extended cameo, while Suvari is the star of the film playing a National Guard soldier who must fight to survive the onslaught of corpses with the munchies.

Of course, when the dead come back, they are covered in puss-oozing wounds, have the ability to run super-fast, crawl on ceilings...in short not only does this film use ""fast zombies"" they now exhibit super-human abilities??!! The gore effect at times can be effective, but nothing we haven't seen before. The storyline jumps around a bit, and the dialog is laughably awful.

In short, while Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" may be considered too talky for some, at least it stayed within the boundaries set by the genre. The remake tries to do something new with the zombies, and it simply fails at every level.",1244419200,,1789,4.640378548895899

This film is wonderfully directed with lots stamina, energy and fast pace. Nice actors also help and the whole cast seems to work. Being a kind of reworking of George A. Romero's sadly underrated classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead-Divimax-Special-Edition/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;it was a delight to see that the writers also reworked the character Bud, the trained Zombie. It was a nice nod to the classic 1985 film.

Now the bad things about this film.
The film introduces a ridiculous new element: the people are sick and in a matter of two seconds, they become rotten zombies. Snap! Just like that. And some of them are so ferocious they even climb through ceilings. And something else: zombies are flammable! LOL These are such dumb ideas.

The makeup is not bad, but we've seen a lot better. I just saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Living-Dead-4-Necropolis/dp/B000EHQ7YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis</a>&nbsp;the other day and found its makeup work superior at some moments.

This is another American horror film shot in eastern Europe and we can clearly see how such option (no matter how much money it saves) is limited when it comes to locations. Too limited in my opinion. This is a trend in today's horror films. But it is true: you try to make Romania or Bulgaria to look like the United States... and you are restricted to the woods, one street and some shabby old military buildings.

And something else: after a nice first half where the small Colorado city where the action takes place gets devoured, the last quarter of the film is spent inside a military secret compound (a cheap set built in a soundstage). In other words, instead of delivering a great ending, the film decides to save money in its last quarter.

All these elements probably brought the film down from receiving a wide release. It looks too cheap even with all the good points I already explained. It's simply an underachiever.

And how did they come up with that idea for the DVD cover? A zombie throwing up? What does that have to do with anything?

I'd still would like to see Mr. Miner directing something better produced and written.",1240012800,,3447,6.818181818181818
3061987,2,B00116GEHU,"From the beginning to the very end.  This movie feels like it was taken from a sub-par horror video game and made direct to video.  With that said you now know where it's headed and if you hate cheesy video game horror movies avoid.  If you kinda like them than this one is alright.
  As for George A Romero.  I think he just sold out the name ""Day of the Dead"" Which is too bad.  Cause I liked his approved ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" remakes. Both were good remakes with a new directors view and vision for the time they came out.

  Why does this feel more like a video game? It's due to the way the scenes cut during action sequences.  Also, the final confrontation i felt like I should be mashing the x butten to pull this and then enter some other combo to move the character to safety.  It really had that forced kinda nuttyness to it. Ie the classic video game rail shooter movement choices left for the characters to pull off/do.

3062008,2,B00116GEHU,"Wow, just wow.  I didn't know the true depth of places in the mind and in the imagination of a filmmaker the art of movies could take me.  Of course, that was all in the past, the past before I viewed the masterpiece of originality, despite it being a remake of a film made over 20 years ago, called Day Of The Dead!  Also, despite the fact that it was not the first film made involving the undead or zombies, especially in recent years. What a novel idea!  Hey, even though there's tons of theatrical and direct-to-video zombie films out there right now and in the past, we'll make another one, but just not any zombie flick, the definitive zombie flick for which all others will be judged and held up to as a template.  It's here.  I thought it would be the second coming of Christ, but it was Day of the Dead, directed with pure brilliance by the aptly described 'brilliant' director, Steve Miner.  Yes, the same Steve Miner behind the cinematic masterpieces like Friday the 13th part 3-d, Lake Placid, Texas Rangers, House, and the ultimate Mel Gibson film, his magnum opus if you will, Forever Young.  Ah, yes I found my cinematic bliss.  Almost thirty years and there it was at my local video store.

Firstly, lets talk about what this film does right, nay, brilliantly.
1. It doesn't waste any time, none, giving the characters depth.  They're  simple-to-digest cyphers there to keep the action moving.  You don't even need to know their names, though the film was goodly enough to provide names.  There's the tough girl, the smart-alecky black guy, the old grizzled soldier, the rookie, and the little brother and his hot girlfriend.  See!?  They simplified it for mass consumption.  Just know genders, and know the one human attitude each contains and you'll be fine.  Sure, you won't relate to, or really care about them or their fate, but you won't get confused either.  Ooh, I just got a shiver from the sheer memory of these immortalized-on-film group of characters.
2. They throw us something new, something innovative and vital to the art of storytelling in any medium.  They give us not only the recently popular fast moving, running zombies, they give us super-strengthed, wall and ceiling crawling zombies. Stop laughing.  It's not like they are web slinging zombies, though that would've pushed the film from brilliant to revolutionary!  Why would zombies that for all intenssive purposes are dying and rotting run or have super strength?  How are they able to cling to walls and ceilings even though the script doesn't give us any info telling us that have grown bits of stick-'em on their palms?  Why ask?  These are logical questions that have no room in a film about the dead coming back to life.  It's ambiguous like Fargo, No Country For Old Men, The Man Who Fell To Earth and other great films.  Don't be sooo anal.  Just enjoy the fact that the director thought so much about your intelligence and capacity to be entertained by giving us something new and never before seen.  WALL CRAWLING ZOMBIES!!!  Oh yeah.
3. The film doesn't bore us with a complex plot or a way to transcend the tired but true story of men and women out running, out smarting, and hiding from zombies.  They barely even give us a plot.  In other words they did us the favor of cutting out the boring parts.  It's just montage filmmaking from one brilliant action set piece to another.
4. They threw in master thespian Ving Rhames.  Does he play the same character from Dawn of the Dead remake?  NOPE!  But, I'm sure they wanted you to think so.  Some may say this is a nefarious trick on the movie going public.  I say, BAH.  I know I smiled as I sat and realised that he was just in this film to tie him to the previous remake.  I was like, ""You bunch of rascally filmmakers, you got me.  You got me good.""  It's like a good practical joke.  Everyone smiles after all is said and done.
5. Trying new things with CGI.  I know all those supposedly big shot filmmakers in Hollywood have tried to hone the art of CGI to bring a larger sense of realism and gradeur to their 'films'.  Day of the Dead remake knows better.  Some may say that the CGI was cheap, and if they couldn't afford to do it well, then they should have done it practically, like older films with make-up and puppet effects.  Shut your mouth, and never think those thoughts again!!!!  This film has the most brilliant CGI ever committed to film.  Anyone can bring dinasaurs to life, that's soooo 1993, but blowing up yellow zombies' heads in full panoramic awesomeness is what the destiny of CGI was built for.  It may have not known that, but do any of us know our ture destinies?

Now onto the film's faults...WAIT, THERE ARE NONE!  I know you thought there was going to be a pro's vs. cons list for this piece, based on my structure, but that's all part and parcel to the mind altering nature of this amazing film.  It changes your mind, your perceptions, your body.  Kind of like the over-rated piece of crap Videodrome, directed by that hack of empty ideas, David Cronenberg, but good.

Some have complained about the midleading nature of the cover artwork, a zombie spewing green vomit and various body parts.  I say, you're just not looking between the lines.  This is not simply some cheap ploy masquerading as cover art, but rather a statement.  Obviously, the gentlemen on the cover saw this film, and was so empowered by the sheer grandiose brilliance contained within he could no longer control his bodily functions.  The filmmakers and cover art designers knew they had a monumental achievement on their hands and rather then simply give us a cover that clued us into the film's content, they gave us something more subliminal.  Amazing.  The movie's greatness goes beyond the actual film and into all aspects regarding it.

Steve Miner is just sitting back and waiting for his DGA lifetime acheivment award.  When that glorious day comes directors like Steven Spielberg, Martin Scoreses, Fracis Coppola, and Alfred Hitchcock's ghost will all have to hide their heads in shame.  For they will have realised that they have wasted their lives, their careers and the the lives of all that have worked for them on their silly efforts.  They may have projected the knowledge of what it feels like to dent the ether of pop-culture with their 'films', but will realise they only wiped their feet on the door matt of greatness.  The word 'greatness' itself will have to be changed accordingly as well.  ""That new flavor of Ben and Jerry's ice-cream was great"", will have to be transformed to ""That new flavor of Ben and Jerry's ice-cream was Day of the Dead remake!""  Oh, the times are chaning and finally for the better.

The dvd itself is indescribeable.  I was going to listen to the film's commentary but then I saw that Steve Miner was on it.  I knew now that I couldn't and I truly didn't have the right to hear the great man's thoughts on his masterpiece.  The minute the first syllable of his first thought's word passes his lips and through my speakers I knew I would run the risk of my head exploding.  I'm not ready.  I hope one day I am, and I can attempt to hear and accept his gospel.  The culmination of my life from this point on will be a wait for that glorious day.  Sigh...  I would suggest that all buy at least two copies of this film on dvd.  One to watch, and one to make sweet love to.  Take my advice, making love to a disc while it is in the dvd player can lead to uncomfortable situations and lots of pain.  This way you can watch the film and truly love it the way it was intended.  And if your love becomes too intense and you break Day of the Dead remake, don't fret.  Nothing can destroy this film.  There will always be more copies at any store, especially Amazon, where they are sold on the ultra cheap side.  Some may say that the amount of used dvds sold on this site is due to the film not being liked by those who blindly bought it without seeing it.  Yeah, RIGHT!  These people are faithful followers to the true teachings of this wonderful film.  They are sacrificing their own pleasure in the form of a used dvd to give up to the less fortunate.  If one of us can't experience this film, then none of us should.

GREATEST FILM I ever saw!!!!  You may disagree, but like all those made in sin, it's your nature to rebel.  Submit today, submit tomorrow, all will become legion with this brilliant film.  Did I mention that I thought it was brilliant?

PS: I know sarcasm doesn't translate that great in the typed word, so I hope the actual star rating I assigned this film clears any confusion up on what I really think it's worth.  If not, then you are obviously mildly retarded and unsupervised.  You know you're not supposed to using the computer!  Not get back in  your pen!",1238198400,,8787,4.525111252383979
3062009,4,B00116GEHU,"I've read some negative reviews for this remake, but I thought it was pretty good. It's very different from the original, so try to be open-minded about it. It's good that they use some of the original names like Sarah, Capt. Rhodes, Salazar, Dr. Logan, and Bub. (Who is renamed to Bud in this one.) Some parts remind me of 'Planet Terror' Also in this one, Capt. Rhodes didn't have too big a part and wasn't corrupt like in the original. Dr. Logan is a lot younger but very selfish, and Salazar is black and has those funny one-liners. The zombies are pretty cool. There are a lot of new characters, and some characters from the original have been taken away. Most of the movie takes place at night and they don't get to the underground missile silo until the end of the movie. This one has a lot more action than the original, but I still like the original better because of the gore effects!

In the small town of Colorado, a virus has been spread. The military has been called in to help with the quarantine, and help people throughout the town. Later, the virus spreads even more, and some people take refuge in the hospital, and the radio station. If you love zombie flicks, I highly recommend DAY OF THE DEAD!!!

3062010,3,B00116GEHU,"What can I say? If you're expecting this to be a remake of Romero's 1985 film, this is far from it. So don't begin to compare to the two movies beyond the obvious. If you like zombie movies in general, then you might end up liking this movie.

The movie is set in a small town in Colorado that becomes infected by an unknown virus that turns people into zombies. As the virus takes its toll on the townspeople, a group of soldiers and towns folks must survive until dawn. Characters include Corporal Sarah Cross (Mena Suvari), Private Salazar (Nick Cannon), and Private Bud Crain (Stark Sands). Ving Rhames (who was in the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) plays a short part as well.

The zombie creation method in this version of Day of the Dead totally differs from Romero's version. Instead of some unknown cause turning people into zombies, the movie explicitly shows that its some type of engineered virus. Interestingly enough, they never really explain why some townspeople are infected and some are not. Anyways, the zombies do retain some part of their former life.

The story goes like this, the military is sent in to enforce a quarantine in a small town, which has come down with a flu like virus, causing the townfolk to turn into zombies, with all hell breaking lose the survivors must fight to get out.

We all know why this film got runed down so we don't need to go there, so let's look at the posatives, the film stands on it's own as a good zombie film, it has all the blood and gore you expect from one and it's the type of the film where you can just switch off your brain for a weekend movie to watch.

The film is not ground breaking but it's not bad either, it just had the misfortune of being branded a remake, when everybody knows it's not.

I wasn't expecting a faithful adaptation of Romero's original, I was actually expecting it to follow on from the mediocre but not so terrible ""Dawn of the Dead"" 're-make', partly because Ving Rhames is in it. In fact this new film has absolutely nothing to do with either and gradually degenerates into what I can only describe as a spoof. In fact, the film takes itself seriously at the beginning but when it becomes clear that the director has run out of ideas, it turns into spoof and a particularly poor spoof at that.

The Romero original films were somewhat cerebral (bar the obvious 'Land of the Dead') insofar as they had some sort of point to make about the nature of man. I think 'Day of the Dead' achieved this most successfully by concentrating on the deteriorating relations between the few survivors  from different facets of life, rather than on zombie vs human action (which only really happens at the end of the film). Okay, the characters were stereotyped and only semi-credible; nevertheless, the vision of man creating 'hell on Earth' (sprinkled with allusions to Dante's 'Inferno') and the futility of the attempts of the lead character Sarah in trying to bring everyone together in order to save not only themselves but potentially the human race was aptly exposed as the military, the scientific community and all else were shown as following their own agenda, to paraphrase the helicopter pilot: ""That's the trouble with the world Sarah, everyone has different ideas concerning what they want out of life"". The zombies outside the compound in which the remaining humans resided were effective representatives of the 'dumb masses' needing to be kept at bay by the powerful few. The enduring image of the film is one of egotistical and power-obsessed men struggling to assert supremacy over a world that is worth little.

In sum, the film had a point and dramatically it was well realized, much suspense and (at least some) interesting characterization.

The fact that this film shares the same name and therefore implies that it has some resemblance to the original is a gross insult to the original that actually was driven by a vision. This new film is utterly pathetic and is typical of modern Hollywood films, particularly horror films, that are generally aimed at the under 18s, in terms of age, or the under 100s, in terms of IQ.

3062039,3,B00116GEHU,"Day of the Dead (Steve Miner, 2008)

Okay, let's get this out of the way first: Steve Miner's brand-spanking-new Day of the Dead is neither a remake of George Romero's 1985 film of the same name-- it borrows a few concepts, but the execution is entirely different-- and, despite the presence of Ving Rhames, it is also not a sequel to Zack Snyder's 2004 not-really-a-remake of Dawn of the Dead. Comparing the two, however, the new Dawn was, in comparison, slavishly faithful. Yeah, I mean, this really isn't a remake. For all that, however, I was very pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable the movie is when taken on its own merits.

Plot: Sarah Bowman (American Beauty's Mena Suvari) fled her provincial little town by joining the army-- or so she thought. She gets posted right back there when the town is quarantined. Nobody's quite sure why the town's been quarantined, but when Sarah's mother comes down with the same thing everyone else has, Sarah and somewhat lovestruck private Bud Crain (Stark Sands, recently of Flags of Our Fathers) rush her to the hospital along with Sarah's intractable younger brother Trevor (An American Crime's Michael Welch) and his girlfriend Nina (AnnaLynne McCord, now in the new 90210 TV series). While there, they bump into a few other army types, notably her commanding officer (Rhames) and an annoying doctor type, Logan (The Dark Knight's Matt Rippy). Once most of the cast is in place, well, you know what's going to happen. Zombies! Blood! Gore! Ving Rhames chewing scenery!

I think that had they attempted a straight remake-- with Romero's last echoes of the Cold War intact-- the movie probably would have been as much of a failure as, well, most of the horror remakes that have come down the pike in the past five years or so. But Miner (Lake Placid) and screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick (Final Destination) reused the title and reimagined the rest, and came up with something that's actually fun, fast-paced, and moderately interesting. Avoid the temptation to compare it to the original (which is extremely interesting, though neither fun nor fast-paced, both by design) and you'll likely enjoy this a great deal more. ***",1223510400,2,2173,4.9316939890710385
3062040,1,B00116GEHU,"I had the reviews read, and heeded them.  But my desire to see something in the realm of zombie was so overwhelming that, despite the warnings, I went ahead and watched it.  I was prepared for a lesser remake from the Zach Snyder Dawn of the Dead, what I was not prepared for was the kind of schlock that this movie threw down my helpless gullet as I prayed for the sake of decency that it would get better as I watched it.  Yes, I could turn it off, but it was SO bad that I had to watch it for fifteen more minutes in hopes that the next 15 would make up for it and my life would not have truly been wasted.  And....it didn't....

Here's what sucked about this movie (note: this is full of spoilers designed to keep you from making the same mistake I did by watching it):  1. The virus is NOT the same as the original.  It's airborne now giving symptoms of a cold causing everyone who had been infected with cold symptoms to stop inexplicably in the middle of what they are doing and spontaneously turn into a zombie for NO reason at all, at the same time.  Poorly contrived, executed, and stupid to boot; 2. The zombies are SUPERNATURAL in nature NOT simply altered humans.  These zombies can climb walls and run along the ceiling like lame Alien knock offs.  The original idea was fine, but these writers forced an unnecessary ""improvement"" and again, executed it poorly and made it look stupid; 3. All of the characters have been redone through a filter of stupidity (including Ving Rhames, you bastards!), all being lead by Nick Cannon.  Truth told, I've never seen his stuff before.  After this, I don't think I can.  Romero fans know that there has always been a surviving and oft times leading black guy who saves the day either fully or in part, and it has been awesome every time.  Cannon's character was insulting, and Romero should sue for taking his idea and turning it into a stupid MTV gen stereotype unfit for social consumption.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.

I understand that the repeated use of a blanket statement is not the kind of review most would hope for, but ""stupid"" PERFECTLY describes this experience in it's most exact form.  Aside from the glaring (and mostly unforgiveable) issues above, the rest is just BORING.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie, and if you are curious regardless of this or any other warning you may receive, I understand.  BUT you'd be better off watching ANY one of the zombie flicks from the '80s that spawned from Romero's work as they are all far superior to this, and cheaper in the long run anyway.",1223510400,2,2564,4.498920086393088

I like the combination of both fast and smart that the zombies were in this film.

3062044,4,B00116GEHU,"The first thing I do when I find out that a new movie is coming to DVD, is to pour over as many online review that I can find, and with this film, pretty much every review paned the heck out of it, so much so, that I swore it off of my, ""DVD's To Get"" list.

But then a coincidental thing happened to me; I was at a Roger's Cable store paying a bill, when what should I see on the in-store monitors, but a rather nice trailer for this very movie (and let me tell you, the trailer looked like a lot of good undead fun).

So on the strength of the trailer, I decided to give the film a chance (as there have been other films that have gotten terrible reviews in the past, that I have then watched and found to be great, so I figured that the same could hold true for this flick)

And guess what, this film was as good as it's trailer implied it would be (watch the trailer online, and if you find the trailer interesting then you'll more then likely like the film).

First off the acting was pretty good for a straight to DVD film, as where the effects, and contrary to other reviews, the story does loosely follow the original in that it deals with the military and scientists point of view during this outbreak, and they do eventually end up in an underground type facility, and they even have the, ""Bud"" character, albeit used in a slightly different manner, but for this version, it works.

Now I personally prefer the slow plodding undead over the uberzombies of the, Dawn of the Dead, remake, but seeing as there is a different type of thing turning the populous into the undead, it works for this film.

My only real contention with this DVD isn't the movie, but the inaccurate DVD cover, because no one ever throws up in the film, not the undead or the living, so the image is very misleading and just plain wrong.

Another thing that I really liked about this film, is that even though the main characters have their faults, they're still likable enough that you're rooting for them to make it, because it seems to have become a trend in movies now a days, to make the main characters so darn annoying that you're actually hoping to see them die, or just don't care when they do.

One reviewer actually took one silly effect for the bases as to why they didn't like the film, and that scene was  during an undead  attack in a hospital where one undead, runs up the side of a wall, crawls for a moment on the ceiling, then drops to the floor to join in on the feeding frenzy, and the reviewer mentioned that the undead must have acquired Spier-Man like qualities, when in fact what you have here is more along the lines of a sight gag, done to promote the fact that these things are fast, so fast in mater of fact, that during a feeding frenzy they'll do anything to get at food, even if it means running up a wall to get around the other undead vying for the same food stuffs (and it only happens once, and for a split second as part of a master shot, and isn't given any special camera time other then that, so I don't see why that one thing could be considered grievous enough to write off an entire film over).

3062047,3,B00116GEHU,"After the surprising quality of the 2004 Dawn Of The Dead remake, it was just inevitable that some other filmmaker would come to put their own vision on another of George Romero's zombieworks. This time his third chapter would get the treatment in 2008's Day Of The Dead. But unlike '04's Dawn sticking close to the original vision, Day takes the phrase ""reimagining"" to a whole new level.

Honestly, aside from a few of the original surnames used, this movie is nothing like the original 1985 Day Of The Dead, From it's location, to it's plot, to the Zombies themselves, this film could have been called anything. In alot of ways it reminded me of that other abomination 2005's Day Of The Dead 2:Contagium, with it's connection to the original in name only. But just for a second let's look past the title, and see if there's a good movie in there somewhere, shall we?

DOTD08 takes a new and fresh look at the world of Zombies, but in a more quickened pace. Apparently in this day and age, we don't have time to wait for zombies to dig out of their graves. Heck, we don't even have time for people to die! That's because in DOTD08, the zombies aren't dead. Huh? Nope, it's another one of those ""Contagium In The Air Virus"" stories we've seen before. Where? Maybe Nightmare City? Demons 1 and 2? 28 Days/Weeks Later? YES, that last one! In fact, this film's premise will remind you of those last films. No longer do we have to wait to get bitten or plain old die, it could happen to anyone in this town at anytime. Talk about a case of ADD filmmaking!

The cast has a few familiar faces that do an adequate job here, including cutie-pie Mena Suvari, stereotypical Nick Cannon, and a phoning-it-in Ving Rhames (possibly playing his brother that he established/mentioned in the previous remake...maybe). But looking at the Zombies themselves, they do give a fresh outlook on the genre that gives mixed results. First, they rot instantly. From the moment you freeze-up from the virus to the time you awaken hungry for flesh, you look weeks dead in an instant. Also like 28D/WL you gain superhuman strength causing great ability to jump high and even climb ceilings....

(I wanna interupt myself right here: Alot of reviewers of this film have mentioned ad nauseum about some ""Zombie Spidermen"" in the film. I want to debunk that right now. There is one scene, lasting 3 seconds, where one zombie, ONE, jumps up, breaks his arms and legs through the ceiling, hangs on to the underneath rafter beams, grabs hold of the next group, moves one space like a jungle gym, and then falls on his victim. THAT'S IT! This comment has bothered me since I've seen the movie because I envisioned an army of wall-crawling nightcrawlers due to these comments. It's just not so.)

....and boy are they flammable! Overall, the effects are pretty darn decent and do keep your eyes busy. But if you're looking for any social commentary that Romero or even DOTD04 provided, forget it. This is just Zombie carnage, and honestly not much of that to begin with. Director Steve Miner, who gave us some great Friday The 13th and Halloween sequels, had provided us with a decent Zombie movie, but like Contagium before it, is cursed to panning by using that established name in vain. But if you can Fast Forward through the title sequence never to see the name, you might enjoy this film better. Comes with some decent extras and a commentary that gives the film just too much credit. Recommended to any fan of the 28 series who thinks a frantic, running zombie is better than a lumbering one (have you guys ever heard of rigormortis?), this will help kill an hour and a half while increasing your desire to see the true 1985 film that inspired it.

P.S.:Do you think that Zombie on the front cover throwing-up his latest victim looks pretty cool? Then you better stare at that box a little longer, it's NOWHERE to be found in the actual movie.

This is another American horror film shot in eastern Europe and we can clearly see how such option (no matter how much money it saves) is limited when it comes to locations. Too limited in my opinion. This is a trend in today's horror films. But it is true: you try to make Romania or Bulgaria to look like the United States... and you are restricted to the woods, one street and some shabby old military buildings.

And something else: after a nice first half where the small Colorado city where the action takes place gets devoured, the last quarter of the film is spent inside a military secret compound (a cheap set built in a soundstage). In other words, instead of delivering a great ending, the film decides to save money in its last quarter.

All these elements probably brought the film down from receiving a wide release. It looks too cheap even with all the good points I already explained. It's simply an underachiever.

And how did they come up with that idea for the DVD cover? A zombie throwing up? What does that have to do with anything?

I could go on forever my friends, but you'd get pretty mad if I just had these stupid spider man references. But I can't help myself, when I see a zombie defy gravity and walk like a spider on the side of a wall I have to laugh and call it a zombiefied spider man. I guess Peter Parker was on vacation in Colorado when the zombie flue hit and he was caught in the crossfire. But then how can I explain the fact that everyone is a super zombie spider man? Seriously though, how does being transformed into an undead zombie give you super powers? Here's a list of zombie super powers.
1) They can climb on walls, like Spider Man. Duh. Think the I Am Legend zombie things (which, BTW, I though were pretty lame when compared to the ones in the book) but with bad makeup.
2) They can catapult themselves without any effort. I had a good laugh when one of the zombies just flew out of his seat without any effort, as if there was a giant spring he was sitting on that just tossed him across the room.
3) Super jumping abilities. Just like you guessed it, spider man. Not only can they scale walls and catapult themselves across the room, but they are pretty mean jumpers too. One second there across the room the next their flying through the air.
4) The ability to walk/stumble/lurch/run/jump/whatever in slow jerking motions impossible for any living person to achieve.

The only thing missing is the web shooter and Mary Jane running down the street in a wedding dress.

Oh, and just to let you know, I didn't really lose fifty pounds, so all you people who are overweight, don't think a Day of the Dead diet is going to help you lose the weight. I laughed because the movie was so over the top BAD that I could not believe my eyes (hence the extra star, I laughed my butt off, its almost so bad its good, almost but not quite), I cried because they made a mockery of my favorite Romero zombie movie Day of the Dead, and I almost lost weight, although maybe not fifty pounds, because I almost blew my head off when the new Bub started eyeing the new Sara's, uhh, package. No Bub, that's a bad zombie, bad zombie, phooey, phooey.

This isn't a remake; besides the name of the film the original and this thing have absolutely nothing in common. The original took place almost exclusively in an underground missile silo where scientists and soldiers held an uneasy truce; this new one has an underground silo, but they don't enter it until near the end and here the scientists are the bad guys and the soldiers the good guys. In the original Captain Rhodes was a young, ruthless, power hungry white guy with a really short temper, here he's an old, disciplined, black guy who's also a well oiled fighting machine.

The old Dr. Logan, AKA Frankenstein, a charming, charismatic, crazy guy who manages to talk people silly; the new Dr. Logan, the biggest A hole in the world.

And not its time for Jonathan's ""word of the day.""

Today's word is, Zombie Pets. Yes I know it sounds a little unconventional to keep a pet zombie around the house, especially one who could potently climb on your walls and stain your ceiling with bloody hand prints (those things are almost impossible to get off) but the benefits of having such a wonderful pet are also very great. Just think of all the things one of these undead creatures can do for you; check the mail, water the plants, mow the lawn, eat your boss, take over the world, and much, much more.
Zombie pets are easy to train and there is no need to feed or clean up after them. They require no nourishment as they are already dead, and because they do not require food they cannot defecate in your lawn or living room. Depending on their previous life they can be taught a host of tasks from running around with guns shooting at the air, pushing shopping carts, or babysitting your children.

Be sure to have your zombie spaded and neutered upon obtaining it, especially if they are of the male persuasion. Don't forget that they still retain a little bit of their former selves, the last thing you want is a baby zombie on your hands.

Always make sure your zombie knows who's in charge. Whenever it starts to growl at company or your children, establish your dominance over it with a quite hit to the nose. If that doesn't work hit it on the back of the head and yell phooey. Remember, zombies are no more dangerous then large dogs if handled correctly, left unattended and unloved though and they could become a danger to you and those around you. Always discipline bad behavior and reward good behavior with a pat on the head.

Keep your zombie on a leash whenever taking it on a walk, even if it has no history of violence. I know it may seem tempting to let it run free in the park but always remember that it is a potently deadly animal. Most states have severe penalties for owners of zombies whose pets attack another human or pet. Keep yourself safe and always maintain direct control over your pet.

And that concludes my word of the day. For those who have not seen this film yet I am sorry but the joke won't be as funny, for those who have I hope you liked it.

Actually ""Day of the Dead"" is a highly entertaining Zombie-Flick that deliveres everything one expects: good trash, gore, humour and well-known main-actors who act, well, lets say ""okay""...

The story is not really important, as we saw it dozens of times (Virus, Transformation, Out of Control, group trying to escape,....and so on) and there were elements of ""Resident Evil"" and ""28 Days/Weeks later"" as the ""life to death transformed"" corpses behave the same hysterical way as the sickos from London, only that americans must be way much hungrier as these zombies are feeding on flesh. And how....

Anyway: ""Day of the Dead"" was fun, a little thrilling, entertaining and better than a lot of other genre-movies BUT somebody in the marketing-departement blew it up by having the idea to sell it as a ""Romero Remake"".

Firstly, this isn't a scene by scene remake of the Romero original, and i think that is a good thing.  This has more of a teenage screamer feel to it - and i wasn't bored at any stage.  The movie has good production values and certainly doesn't feel like a low budget b-movie.  I'm not sure where some of the reviews here are coming from to be honest - but you be the judge.  Mena Suvari steals the show here as the sassy but somewhat unbelievable army colonel.  Its different, but that is what the zombie genre needs.  The zombies themselves move hard and fast and there is plenty of action and gore as you would expect.

The writing and acting was pretty much Dawson creek.  None of the characters were believable.  The computerized special effects were very badly done.  The regular special effects were decent.

Ok, so the movie did try to add new dimension with the disease aspect, the vegan zombie and the smart zombie.  Not done well enough to justify breaking the 'zombie rules'.

The only part of the movie that I did enjoy and added to the 'zombie takeover mythology' was the massacre scenes at the hospital.  It was nice to see the 'first hour' attacks on a lot of unsuspecting people.  Other films hinted at it and the Dawn of the Dead remake had a small amount of it, although not like this--with tons of panicked people in close proximity to the zombies who are taking them down and feasting on their bodies right and left.

3062109,1,B00116GEHU,"DAY OF THE DEAD.  George Romero couldn't make a good movie with this title...and apparently, neither can anybody else.

As a C-quality movie this new version of Day of the Dead may be just ""passable"".  But for fans of cinema or just zombie movies in general, this isn't going to cut it.

Day of the Dead starts out dull with scenarios we're all too familiar with, plods along slowly with one dimensional characters we could care less about, and manages to pick up mild speed when zombies start to appear.

The list of problems with this movie are far too many:
*Are the zombies really undead or just victims of some bio-plague?
*Why do people ""convert"" to zombies so quickly?
*How can some zombies leap around like they're straight out of Gymkata?
*What is with that funky DVD cover art picture?
*Who believes Mena Suvari or Nick Cannon are really in the military?
*How'd the hot high school babe learn to shoot a gun so fast?
*How much was Ving Rhames paid for his 10-minutes of work?
*And where exactly is this movie going?

On the plus side, the zombies look good and are frightening at times.  There's one stop-pause-rewind death scene worth enjoying, and some of the direction and camera techniques work and give the movie an occasional jolt.

But, it's all far too little to recommend...to even people I don't like (much less the wonderful readers here at Amazon).  So do yourself a favor and rent a good zombie movie like the superior recent remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD or read a great zombie novel like J.L. Bourne's DAY-BY-DAY ARMAGEDDON.",1214697600,,1546,4.633699633699634

Romero, but just because you love Romero, that doesn't mean you have to shun all other zombie flicks. C'mon...think out of the box people!!!
This movie had non-stop action that left you on the edge of your seat all throughout the movie and the gore was fantastic!! People have also commented that the acting was bad. I couldn't disagree more. I know bad acting when I see it and I'm sorry, the characters in this film were more than believable.
So, if ou love action and gore that makes your stomach turn, this movie is for you!!! Now if you're a boring individual that simply likes to watch the same types of movies over and over and over again, go right ahead, pass this up......*yawn*",1214611200,3,989,4.5
3062111,4,B00116GEHU,"If you're looking for an entertaining horror film, this is it.  I do not understand the negative reviews this film is getting, especially as the writers are acting like this film personally attacked them.  They go on and on about how ridiculous the film is, which is complete nonsense -- it's a bloody living dead zombie movie, and that means it's about gore and horror, not about realism and sensible plots.  I also cannot understand why the film didn't get a theatrical release, because I would have loved to see this film in a theater full of screaming people.  I think this is much preferable to the ""remake"" of Dawn of the Dead from 2004, a film I also enjoyed, but I liked this one better.

Narrative-wise this is a sort of cross between Romero's Crazies story (which I believe is ALSO being ""remade"") with the more traditional Night of the Living Dead gut-munching.  In other words, it's not the Dead coming back, it's about infected people.  The film is gloriously gory, and it's paced like a bullet!  If this isn't a good horror movie, then what is it people want?

Among the Amazon reviews I've scanned, I see people calling this a ""travesty"" of the Romero original.  But if you look at the general reviews of Romero's film from 1985, when it was released, you'll see the SAME crap as you get here -- people complaining about bad dialog and horrible acting.  So little has changed -- horror films get no respect at all, not even by the fans themselves.

I think the acting is fine, because how else would you act in situations like you get here?  How many different ways do you scream and run?  The plot is quite acceptable, and the performances are just fine.  I'm a big fan of Mena Suvari, and she fits her role perfectly, and everyone complements each other.  The military is called in to quarantine a small Colorado town, and except for the officers, who would be a bit older and more ""professional,"" it's quite realistic than the soldiers would be younger and not so experienced.  Which is a fine setup to when everything goes wrong, as it does.

I do admit that Romero is the master, and he brings a larger world-view to his work -- by which I mean social comment.  Neither this nor the Dawn remake can even begin to do that.  But as entertainments, this works perfectly.  It won't change your life, but it will give you a nice 90 minute tingle or two.",1213920000,,2368,4.498829039812646

Zombie spider man, zombie spider man, does whatever a zombie/spider does. Eats your limbs, climbs on walls, shoots other zombies in the head. Look out; here comes the zombie spider man.

I could go on forever my friends, but you'd get pretty mad if I just had these stupid spider man references. But I can't help myself, when I see a zombie defy gravity and walk like a spider on the side of a wall I have to laugh and call it a zombiefied spider man. I guess Peter Parker was on vacation in Colorado when the zombie flue hit and he was caught in the crossfire. But then how can I explain the fact that everyone is a super zombie spider man? Seriously though, how does being transformed into an undead zombie give you super powers? Here's a list of zombie super powers.
1) They can climb on walls, like Spider Man. Duh. Think the I Am Legend zombie things (which, BTW, I though were pretty lame when compared to the ones in the book) but with bad makeup.
2) They can catapult themselves without any effort. I had a good laugh when one of the zombies just flew out of his seat without any effort, as if there was a giant spring he was sitting on that just tossed him across the room.
3) Super jumping abilities. Just like you guessed it, spider man. Not only can they scale walls and catapult themselves across the room, but they are pretty mean jumpers too. One second there across the room the next their flying through the air.
4) The ability to walk/stumble/lurch/run/jump/whatever in slow jerking motions impossible for any living person to achieve.

The only thing missing is the web shooter and Mary Jane running down the street in a wedding dress.

Oh, and just to let you know, I didn't really lose fifty pounds, so all you people who are overweight, don't think a Day of the Dead diet is going to help you lose the weight. I laughed because the movie was so over the top BAD that I could not believe my eyes (hence the extra star, I laughed my [...] off, its almost so bad its good, almost but not quite), I cried because they made a mockery of my favorite Romero zombie movie Day of the Dead, and I almost lost weight, although maybe not fifty pounds, because I almost blew my head off when the new Bub started eyeing the new Sara's, uhh, package. No Bub, that's a bad zombie, bad zombie, phooey, phooey.

This isn't a remake; besides the name of the film the original and this thing have absolutely nothing in common. The original took place almost exclusively in an underground missile silo where scientists and soldiers held an uneasy truce; this new one has an underground silo, but they don't enter it until near the end and here the scientists are the bad guys and the soldiers the good guys. In the original Captain Rhodes was a young, ruthless, power hungry white guy with a really short temper, here he's an old, disciplined, black guy who's also a well oiled fighting machine. The original Bub, awesome. The new Bub, de de de. The old Dr. Logan, AKA Frankenstein, a charming, charismatic, crazy guy who manages to talk people silly; the new Dr. Logan, the biggest A hole in the world.

3062148,3,B00116GEHU,"With Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari, Michael Welch, Pat Kilbane and Nick Cannon starring in a zombie movie is worth watching. People really can't expect to have high expectations when it comes to zombie movies now theses days so with that in mind reviewers should not be so hard on rating them. Ok so first off I do think that they went about this all wrong promoting the movie and if they have poor sales blame it on the company who gave the ok on the DVD cover. It would've got more attention just having a picture of all the stars holding weapons with a zombies all in the background instead of one cover having a zombie throwing up and on the other DVD cover a few scary faces floating around on the cover.
No zombies threw up on anyone in the movie. The virus spreaded like a cold and this could've actually played as a part of dawn of the dead as if this was taking place elsewhere not too far away from the other locations that were in the dawn of the dead. Ok, let's just say Ving Rhames had a twin brother in the military. Because in Dawn of the Dead as an officer of the law who he played he did mention that he had a brother who was in the military who he wanted to go and reach to see if he was ok. Nick cannon at first I thought acting was overdone but he sort of blended in with all the mix once the movie really got the ball rolling. And there were some corny parts that I would've just left out for the bonus features on the DVD. The acting and special effects were done pretty good in my eyes. Also if folks haven't realized by now ZOMBIES don't move slow anymore in movies today (thanks to the remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead and 28 weeks later). It adds more pressure of suspense trying to get away from them. I've seen tons of pointless rated ""B"" zombie movies with sorry special effects. The fact that we can still get some decent ones out here with good actors in it needs to be given a little more credit if we want them to get any better but at the same time if companies are going to put that much money into getting these actors then they need to find better ways of promoting them, better way advertising so it will sell. Because I've seen better ""B"" rated movies with way better artwork on them than what a title like DAY OF THE DEAD should have. I'd fire the person who designed both of the DVD covers.

If I didn't happen to see the names of the stars who were playing in this movie I'd might have overlooked it very easliy with the chessy DVD cover they are using to sell it.",1211241600,,2525,4.134146341463414
3062149,1,B00116GEHU,"Well, the good news for fans of Romero's Day of the Dead is that this horrible piece of filmmaking is only about %5 remake. Thankfully, the filmmakers injected a whole lot that has absolutlely nothing to do with Romero's 1985 classic. Unfortunately most of what they came up with, to borrow the imagery on the dvd cover, blows chunks.
  Apart from some minor similarities (character names, a brief time spent in a military bunker, soldiers) the '08 Day of the Dead plays more like a lame rip-off of 28 Days Later. The 'zombies' here are people infected by a (yawn) ""secret government warfare project which leaks out into a small town"". One minute, the townsfolk have the symptoms of a common cold with added nosebleed, the next they are transformed instantly into pizza-faced super-ghouls (with make-ups reminiscent of the original Evil Dead) who can leap through the air like characters in a Hong-Kong fantasy film and who can climb upside down on ceilings like Spiderman. And of course, like all good modern 'zombies', these are especially fast runners.
  One theme of Romero's that the filmmakers did include was that of the dead remembering parts of their former selves and former lives. But here, it goes no further than 'Bud' being aware that he was a vegetarian whilst alive, and therefore having no taste for the human flesh that his kind crave. Oh, and he also recalls that he has a crush on Mena Suvari's character, Sarah, and this attraction carries over, along with his vegetarianism, into his afterlife. Unfortunately the film wasn't set up as a comedy, and nothing else in it is funny.
  So, fans of Romero's Day of the Dead rest easy. Day of the Dead 2008 is really no remake at all.

Nick Cannon comes off as a poor man's Will Smith, and Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames seem to have just stopped by for the paycheck. I thought the actor that played ""Bud"" was pretty good, though.

2) PRODUCTION: I only need to say this: C.G.I. I know that nowadays computer generated effects are easy to do and more more inexpensive than actual physical special effects, but I would think somewhere in the production line, someone would point out that everything can't (or shouldn't) be generated by a computer.
The filming of this movie was acceptable as was the soundtrack. I was greatly disappointed that a lot of simple special effects, such as blood splattering, was done by C.G.I. I'm assuming that the majority of the money spent on this opus was to pay the salaries of Suvari, Rhames and Cannon. I would've sent in ten bucks so the make up artist could've ran to the corner 7-11 and bought some Karo syruo and red food dye. And the scene on the cover? Doesn't even happen in this movie.

3) ZOMBIES: HUH?!? 1968--Zombies walking? It defies logic! 2004--Zombies running?? That's just not possible!! 2008--Zombies sticking to the walls like Spider-man??? Ummmm....okay...
The zombie make up is okay, but nothing incredible. It is a step up from the ""pale faced raccoon eyes"" that we're so accustomed to seeing in low / no budget zombie flicks.

4) THE CAUSE: Government created flu-like virus.

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL: I'm kinda speechless. The fact that this cinematic gem is a ""remake"" of Romero's 1985 flick may have been it's biggest flaw. I really feel that if this movie was called something else, we, the zombie loving community that we are, would've ben more accepting of it. It would've gone down as just another cheesy, mediocre zombie flick. I guess there really isn't a thing called ""bad publicity."" How many debates and arguements have and will occur as this is compared to Romero's original?
And sadly, Steve Miner is an established known horror director. Here, it seems he showed up, again, just for the paycheck. Ving Rhames, in my opinion, was in this to make potential viewers think that this was a continuation of the much better 2004 remake of 'Dawn of the Dead,' even though his character died in that one.
Now, here's the clinker. If this was, as I mentioned, a cheesy, mediocre zombie flick with a different name, lesser known actors and an unknown / unproven director, I think I would've enjoyed it more. I could've been more forgiving. The fact that it was to be a remake, with an established director and proven actors, means that it should've been so much more. Sadly, I was glad when this 'Day' was over.

The movies takes place in Leadville, Colorado--so did ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown""--(the original was in Florida), and I do wish that someone would explain that having lead characters who have the acting presence of a turnip will hurt your movie.

3062192,5,B00116GEHU,"This movie really impressed me as a 're-telling' of the Day of the Dead story line. As in the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' - characters are revealed, inside jokes abound, and references to the orignal story line are used liberally.  Thus creating a movie that should be watched as it's own entity and not just as a remake.  All the bashing of this movie is like bashing the new 'Dawn' because they walked into the mall instead of landing on the roof in a helicopter - Get over it. I was glad that they took it out of the bunker and into the streets. The hospital breakout had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation and it delivered full force.

The Zombie effects were overall pretty good, although they could have gored it up a bit more for my taste (or at least lingered a bit longer). The CGI effects were noticible in a few small parts, but overall the effects were pretty cool. Much better than many of the Backyard Zombie films out there. And for all the people who wrote reviews months before this DVD was released - get an original DVD and stop complaining about the quality of the effects on your bootleg.

I am so glad that I ignored the all the bashing reviews and went ahead and got this for my collection. Is it perfect? No, but it sure was fun to go on the ride.",1208995200,5,1279,4.208163265306123
3062193,3,B00116GEHU,"Ok, first let me say everyone that have bad things to say about this flick have some, I said some, valid points.

This is techincally not a remake, in my eyes it's a retelling at the very least so don't go into this expecting otherwise. Being a Romero fan, they should not have used the Day of the Dead title, I'm sure alot of poeple will agree. If you think about it the Dawn of the Dead re-make was more of a retelling wasn't it, and that was a really great film. Not as good as the original in alot of was but was pretty darn good.

All that being said, if your a ""zombie"" flick fan as I am, you really should at least watch this with an open mind. With so many ""zombie"" films not living up to the expectation of the trailer and reviews, which I try not to listen to anyway, this film really isn't that bad. Everyone has different ideas some are lame ( Vampires vs Zombies anyone?) and some work well Dawn of the Dead (re-telling).

This is one film that should stand alone. Keep Romero's original out of mind. I see this film as a must have for hardcore ""zombie"" flick fans!

The ""zombies"" look good, and I do think it works well. That's just my opinion, watch for yourself.",1208995200,2,1178,4.176211453744493
3062194,2,B00116GEHU,"What a waste. I was really hoping Steve Miner could pull this off. This is a huge insult to George Romero. Let's just say when a movie is direct-to-video, it's ususally for a reason. Snyder's 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was obviously an anomaly and the standard of detestable classic horror remakes is alive and well with the 2008 ""Day of the Dead"".

The zombies are truly laughable: they bounce around like the monkey-bats from ""The Wizard of Oz"", climb walls and ceilings like your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and get instant Freddy Krueger pizza face during the morphing process.

I'd give it 1 star, but I have seen worse; much worse. Spider-Zombies can't hold a candle to the Raccoon-Eye Zombies of the repugnant spectacle that was Ulli Lomell's ""Zombie Nation"".

Do yourself a favor, skip this and buy any of the official Romero flicks or the Snyder remake of ""Dawn"". Already own 'em? Upgrade and buy 'em in blu-ray. That would be money well spent.",1208908800,,966,4.772455089820359
3062195,1,B00116GEHU,"The remake of ""Day of the Dead"" has almost nothing to do with the original.  The only similarities seem to be the main characters are National Guardsmen and there's a ""friendly"" semi-intelligent zombie named Bud.  However, the original Day was the worst film Romero ever did, and not significantly better than this.

Yeah, zombification is spread via an airborne bioweapon that escaped from a secret government lab, which is a neat twist.  The zombies, however, are something else.  Fast zombies?  How about superfast gymnastic zombies who can leap over obstacles and even crawl across the ceiling -- NO, we shant be having zombified supervillans, it shall not stand.  Then, the instantaneous zombification process, to which I must also say NO.  Here's what I'm seeing -- *cough* ""Uh, I feel kinda bad, dang flu."" Then POW -- INSTANT SUPER ZOMBIE!!!  Really, sicko is laying in bed all coughin' and barely able to move, but within seconds they are not only flying across the room at warp speed to chow down, but they've somehow been completely transfigured with full body ulcerations and such.  Not even a 5 minute transformation process.  And what is with the ""vomit"" picture on the cover?  I must've somehow missed the zombie puke scene -- was there one?

The other thing that got to me was the handguns that would rapidfire 200+ rounds out of a single magazine (with ""vwip vwip"" noises that sounded as if they'd been dubbed from a videogame . . . don't y'all know guns go ""BANG""?), then a character saying, ""We'll need to get some more ammo soon!"" . . . but they never reload or run dry.  Zombie Bud doesn't attack his companions ""because he was a vegetarian"" -- yet other zombies will think nothing of attacking family members?  Then there was the token black man who kept making comments about his perceived oppression throughout . . . once or even twice might've worked, but it got old fast.  And the girl going, ""Hey, let's just just the nozzles off these flammable gas cannisters and ignite then to make a big flamethrower thingee!"" . . . but wouldn't it it far more likely just to explode?  And why are there suddenly a hundred zombies hiding out at the secret base far from town?  Need I also mention the National Guardsmen zombies firing M-16s?  As for the Alternate Ending -- don't even bother wasting your time with it.

It was watchable . . . but turned out to be a complete waste of time.  Better films include: Dawn of the Dead (original 78 version), Night of the Living Dead (1990 remake), and Hide & Creep.",1208736000,2,2524,4.665158371040724

And I think that could have been done by not jumping into the action so fast and letting the story unfold a little more. I think the black guy jokes were a little over done by the african american character.. The acting wasn't superb in parts.. But it wasn't all that bad either.. And at times the cast done pretty well. Someone here said the FX were really low budget.. What movie were they watching? The FX were pretty darn good.. Nice zombie make up. I think what they went for here was a more action packed zombie movie.. and wanted to show the actual zombie take over.. rather than the isolated survivor kind of story. The movie did have alot of zombie action in it.. And some will enjoy it just for that.. My 64 year old mother actually liked this movie.. and she's a hard one to please on horror these days.. So all things being said.. it wasn't that bad. It was one of those movies that after you watch it.. it kind of sinks in and grows on you.. And you actually realize that you kind of liked it..

The Nike silo/bunker looked like a cheap set that the Resident Evil folks decided wasn't good enough for their work.  The super speed was bad but the climbing on the ceiling bit, was HORRIBLE.  I can take a lot of cheesy stuff, but that was not only bad, but unrealistic--if they can climb ceilings, why couldn't get into the ducts the main characters were climbing through? How would a nerve agent meant to paralyze enemy soldiers for 72 hours mutate you into something that can jump 10 feet in the air and climb on ceilings?  a little too farfetched...

I also don't mind borrowing from other movies, but some of the tricks that were taken from Snyder's version of Dawn of the Dead were poorly used and didn't make a lot of sense.

I also liked the acting as well as the comedy involved with the movie. I loved it when the one character told the severed head to ""shut up [...]!"" and kicked it like a football. I also liked the fact that they tried to do something different with this movie and gave some of the zombies superhuman characteristics like wall climbing.

3062220,5,B00116GEHU,"Despite the fact that it was planned as a theatrical release but found its' way as a direct-to-DVD movie and most reviewers find it disappointing; I, personally, thought it was a great followup to 2004's Dawn of the Dead. When it comes to zombie movies, I'm pretty outspoken on whether they are good or not and, this one, measures right up there with ""28 Days Later"" yet on its' own. Although the film doesn't have any connection to Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"", the film itself was based on George Romero's original 1985 script & film of the same name.

The film is directed by Steve Miner(best known for ""Halloween H20""). It was written by Jeffrey Reddick(known for his ""Final Destination"" screenplays) and stars Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari, and Nick Cannon.

It tells the story of a government contained city infected by zombies.  The remaining survivors try to make their way to an underground tunnel. That's, basically, where the fun begins. Like ""Dawn of the Dead"" before it, ""Day of the Dead"" tries to take a fresh spin on the zombie genre. For the most part, it succeeds admirably with great acting by Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari, and Nick Cannon.

While it may not break new ground(like 28 Days Later) as much as it should for a zombie movie, it is still a great movie. One I highly recommend in the onslaught of remakes these days(and I do mean onslaught).",1208217600,3,1364,4.647302904564316
3062221,2,B00116GEHU,"What a fantastic opportunity they had with this film.  With a few revisions, Romero's original script could have made a much better film than this one is.  While it's good that there's more than one woman in this movie, Sarah should have remained a scientist, and there is no need for the Trevor character to be her brother.  They took away the brilliant madness of Dr. Logan, who is not a hospital clinician, but one of the creators of the virus.  Salazar is annoying, and the romantic tension between he and Sarah is totally gone, replaced by a thoroughly inappropriate pseudo-relationship with Bud.  And the whole idea of the super-zombie has become absolutely overdone.  Real zombie terror is generated by a slow zombie, who kills you through your own stupidity.

One more thing:  What is it with these movies with killing off the medics?  Can't any Doctors or nurses (Sarah Polley's character doesn't seem to have much knowledge of medicine or biology) survive a zombie movie?",1208131200,,981,4.86144578313253

Steve Miner took a lot from his slasher movie roots, especially in the first forest run of fear from the killer. Many points in the movie, including bodies falling from hiding places and standard slasher suprises pepper the movie.

But I do put a premium on zombie feasts and zombie kills, and this movie is chock full of them. The outbreak takes place pretty early in the movie, and we are treated to an all out zombie assault on the small Colorado town like I don't think I've seen in movies before. It's a zombie free-for-all that the protagonists have to fight their way through, dropping zombies left and right. I really liked this segement of the movie, and in those moments, redeemed the bad reputation it had garnered before I watched it.

As a disciple of Romero, I naturally am not happy with more people cashing in on his works. But if this movie makes people want to explore the original, then bully for ""Day..."" 2008.

My other gripe was that the zombies were like ninjas in some parts. Fast moving. OK. Ninja attacks from walls and ceilings. Nnnnnnnnnnnnno!

Nope, not happening here. This movie was actually quite terrible, and when viewed with pleasant expectations, it makes the entire experience even more excruciating to see. The film opens up with a quarantine of a small Colorado town being enforced by a group of National Guardsmen, including Ving Rhames (shame on him for adding his name to this cast of poor actors staving off starvation in real life) over a chemical agent's release into the air that ""suddenly"" turns people into zombies. Oh, the zombies are rather poorly made up as well. The movie then becomes a somewhat comical romp that you are sorely tempted to simply turn off. I left it on in the hopes that it would get better, but now only know that I'm a glutton for punishment.
This movie was a great opportunity wasted for the cast and direction was deplorable, but the writing was even worse. I know that George Romero is releasing Diary of the Dead next month.

If the title weren't ""Day of the Dead"", it would be confused with countless other low-watt, forgettable zombie fare.  But measuring a film by previously set standards works both ways.  Yes, if it weren't titled ""Day of the Dead"" we might not care much about this film (that cheap, stupid cover art sure doesn't make you wanna grab it off the shelf either), but then again, we also would judge it on its own merit, not that of Romero's original. And, yes, admittedly, its merits are few, but as these cheapie zombie hodgepodges go, this one is fitfully amusing and mostly entertaining.  Oh, it is as dumb as has been pointed out here from any kind of technical standpoint, and the film seems limited by its budget, so it overcompensates - and fails - with cutting and other camera tricks that become tedious and only draw attention to its lack of budget and ambition (unlike the 2004 ""Dawn"" re-amp), but, beyond those gripes (and perhaps the performances are not the greatest, but how many Oscar winners sign up for low budget zombie remakes?) it delivers the zombie goods:  Lots of action, no hammy, self important or referential attempts at drawing parallels between zombies and humans, or society, or less-than-subtle condemnations of the government; just lots of zombies, lots of blood, and lots of action.  It moves at a fast pace and it's all done before the 90 minute mark.  Either you like this stuff or you don't.  And by that, I mean just true, blue zombie flicks.  This isn't the message movie that ""28 Weeks Later"" tried to be, or the metaphor Romero likes to sneak up on us with (or hammer our skulls with depending on your opinion of how subtly he delivers his messages), or the attempt to revitalize zombie flicks that Zack Snyder's ""Dawn' remake was.  It's just an old fashioned, cheesy zombie flick.  On that level, it's better than most that fit said category.  I expected very little here and was pleasantly surprised, a feat that always gets me defending a movie perhaps more than it deserves, but it always feels like a feat none the less.

excellent film that should've been released.  The film made me jump a
couple of times and though it's not truly remake, I think it works on the

The zombies were as good as in the remake of Dawn of The Dead and the
virus was man made which can explain why the zombies were so frenetic.

In fact, these remade zombies would work better in a different genre altogether.  Say battling a caped crusader in Gotham?  This is not a zombie movie.  Someone needs to seriously operationalize the definition of zombie so we don't get any more of these overly ambitious, silly films.

True zombie afficionados UNITE before real zombies become extinct and future generations never know the joy of vicariously fleeing zombies they actually have a shot at getting away from.",1207785600,2,909,4.934210526315789
3062265,3,B00116GEHU,"Ok, spiderman zombies are pretty silly and the superhuman ones are insane.  However, the whole movie was pretty decent all in all.  No, it is not a remake of Day of the Dead.  It says right on the box, based on the Day of the Dead.  What part is it based on, well, there are zombies.  Bub is in it as well as some of the other characters.  Other then that, not much else is the same.  The military pretty much stays together.  There is no psychological issues going on other then trying to survive a zombie attack.

If you take the movie as a zombie movie with pretty decent effects you will be happy.  If you are a purist that think a remake has to be exactly the same, you will go away unhappy.  Check out the review for a poor review.

I watch almost every zombie movie I can get my hand on.  Some are pure drek while others are enjoyable.  Seriously, this is an enjoyable movie.  Nick Cannon is pretty good contrary to what other people say and yes, there are lines in this movie that will be quoted for years to come.  Including ""Why do white people always have to split up?""  Watch it and make sure you don't have soda in my mouth when they finally get to the bunker!

All in all this is good movie.  If you take it for what it is, a zombie movie.  No nitpicking about fast zombies, spiderman zombies, superman zombies.  Get by it and enjoy it for the fact that if these were the zombies humans had to face in the zombie armageddon we would be toast.

3062269,3,B00116GEHU,"First thing I wanna say is what the hell is up with the cover art? It just might rate as one of the very worst I have ever seen. There were others and all were bad, but the one they went with is easily the worst.

Don't go into Day of the Dead expecting a remake of the George Romero classic. This is a remake by name only; about the only thing the share in common are some zombies, the military and a couple of characters from the original. Most of the characters are created for this movie and the whole plot completely different. Day of the Dead 08 is only a remake by name only attempting to cash in on the success of the Dawn of the Dead remake and Romero's Dead flicks.

Day of the Dead is entertaining in how bad it was. Most of this will probably be lost on the audience since most of us won't be able to help, but compare to the two. As a remake Day of the Dead is a travesty of a film and complete insult to the original. But as a stand alone movie it's actually fun in how bad it is. I was able to put the original out of my head and take the movie for what it was; a silly zombie flick.

Day of the Dead features zombies that run, which is common these days, but they also are able to jump put windows, crawl across ceilings, climb over gates and also even use weapons. If anything Day of the Dead is more of a remake of Umberto Lenzi's Nightmare City. Those two have more in common than this does with the original Day of the Dead.

The screenplay was written by Jeffrey Reddick and it actually wasn't too bad, while most of his characters lack any depth, the script does have some fairly good moments. Again judging things on its own and not comparing to Romero's Day of the Dead, the script isn't too bad. It has elements that work and some that don't. So far I've liked Jeffrey Reddick and while this is easily his weakest script honestly it wasn't so bad. It does follow the typical Hollywood movie with the comedy aspect and some jokes were about 10-years too late, but overall it's an entertaining screenplay. Not great, but entertaining.

Director Steve Miner got his start in 1981 with Friday the 13th Part II and the following year did the 3rd installment. At the time Miner got his start there were many filmmakers just starting out in the horror genre and some others who may have been around for 10-years or more were at the peak of their career and making some of the best films of their career. So I suppose some filmmakers are bound to be left out in the cold and it seems Steve Miner was one of them. One thing that does surprise me is that isn't better known. He directed the first Friday the 13th with Jason as the killer and the first with Jason to get his Iconic mask.

Steve Miner seems to have gone back and forth between feature films and TV episodes. I do enjoy some of his work mainly his two Friday the 13th movies, but the problem with Steve Miner, which is good for Hollywood is he has no style of his own. Most of his films are just following the basic formula of another filmmaker; which also helps him land jobs when you need a quick cash in Steve Miner is the man to go to. If only he injected more of his own style in his work I think while he may not go down as one of the greatest horror filmmakers he would have had a much better career. He's shown flashes of originality, but he still does it by the books.

Steve Miner was the wrong choice for Day of the Dead; it lacks originality at every turn and he never manages to build any suspense or tension. There were a few scenes that could have worked better, but the zombies just roam around like a bunch of shuffling idiots. I assume Day of the Dead was meant to be a little campy, but it was just too much at times, thus killing any chance for a legit attempt at any suspense. The pacing of the movie is pretty good there is enough happening to keep the viewer from getting bored and while there were flaws with the script, with another director I do feel this could have been a lot better, not great, but better. But what we get is a movie that is rather bad, but entertainingly bad. Visually the movie is also weak, while it doesn't suffer from shaky cam syndrome the shot selections are kinda poor and sometimes it's tough to make out what's happening and the flashy editing doesn't really help matters.

Despite my comments I do enjoy some of Steve Miner's work in particular the two Friday the 13th movies he did. Most of my comments here were negative, but I do enjoy his work and I know he could do better. Not sure what went wrong on his part, but I do like some of his work, he just lacks originality.

The acting was fairly decent; none of the major cast members are bad. They put in good enough performances; the strongest coming from Mena Suvari as Sarah. Some say she didn't have the military persona down, but regardless I thought she did well and is the saving grace of the movie. Ving Rhames gives his usual tough guy performance and does well in a rather small role. Nick Cannon as Salazar while giving a fairly good performance is just damn annoying; his constant one-liners really aren't that funny with the exception of maybe one or two.

There is plenty of gore, but the problem is most of it is CGI, which is really annoying. Some of the CGI was fairly decent, but most were bad. Some of it looks like something you'd seen on Playstation 2. Even good CGI I'm not really into, but when it's poor it makes it even worse. Steve Miner is an old school guy I'm sure he could have been more creative and had some simple, but effective deaths instead of the poor fake looking CGI.

Day of the Dead was originally meant for a theatrical release, but ended up going direct to video, which isn't much of a surprise. Everything about Day of the Dead is DTV, but with that said I will admit to enjoying it. Again as a remake this is a travesty and an insult, but as its own movie it's sort of fun in how bad it is. Most reviews for Day of the Dead will be quite poor and honestly I understand why and I'm not even gonna attempt to defend the movie.

But with that said I did enjoy Day of the Dead as its own movie, because again outside of a couple of things this is a remake by name only. If you can view it as just another zombie movie you just might enjoy it a little bit. Sure Day of the Dead is rather bad, but it can also be fun.",1207699200,9,6345,4.17483660130719
3062310,2,B00116GEHU,"I should probably begin here by stating what many will agree is already obvious. Regardless of whatever screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick might otherwise claim, this is not a remake of George A. Romero's ""Day of the Dead."" It doesn't even further the story set in motion by Zack Snyder's surprisingly effective ""Dawn of the Dead.""

Director Steve Miner has instead opted to tack on a whole new narrative outside of what Snyder's earlier film successfully established. The spoiled meat of this new film centers around the town of Leadville, Colorado, where a mysterious flu-like virus has reduced the townsfolk to nosebleeds and nagging coughs. The military, led by the returning Ving Rhames in a role unrelated to his ""Dawn"" persona, is brought in to enact a quarantine and contain the disease before it spreads. But when flu victims quickly degenerate into flesh craving ghouls, the commandos and a handful of various other survivors soon realize the situation has far more darker and insidious origins. Predictable chaos ensues, the dead take over and we, the viewers, are left scratching our heads and wondering just what in the world this nonsense has in common with George Romero's far superior 1985 original.

I didn't necessarily hate this movie. Hate is, perhaps, too harsh of a word. I actually had a fun time with this and will more than likely be watching it again several more times down the road, just for kicks. But it could have and should have been so much more than mindless, substandard throwaway fluff. This has all the action, gore and cheap thrills the casual fan may very well admire. However, in wake of Zack Syder's impressive and far more serious ""Dawn of the Dead,"" again, I guess I was basically hoping Miner would follow that film's example and give me more bang for my buck. It is in that respect, unfortunately, that this new ""Day"" falls considerably short. Don't expect an epic. This went straight to DVD and, upon viewing the film in its entirety, one can almost certainly understand why.

It's not a complete loss, certainly nowhere near as bad as most others, but you could do better.",1207612800,2,2113,4.863888888888889

They knew how to climb stairs, use instruments, guns, avoid obstacles and a variety of other things. Plus, they were uber zombies! Zombies on steroids, or speeds or both! I like the idea of the running zombie, it makes it more challenging, but these zombies were more like Spiderman zombies. They attached themselves to the ceiling, ran faster than a human and jumped incredible distances. Shouldn't a zombie have the same limitations as a human?

The movie played a bit with subject of the original Day of the Dead. Bub, the zombie that was being trained, is mirrored in the character of Private Bud Crain(playing with the names a bit, eh?!). Bud, who was a vegetarian, shows many human, or at least animal, charactersitics. Without giving much away, he remains a vegetarian and follows the military orders. He played a good character with a lot of potential. But, they movie did not explore it quite enough...like most of the characters and storylines. The movie throws in some back stories here and there, yet never explores them. The movie sacrificed content for brevity.

It is an ok movie, better than most zombie movies. But, it fails to explore so many possibilities that it makes you frustrated. The movie could have been better and longer.

3062312,4,B00116GEHU,"I've been reading some negative reviews for this remake, but I watched it last night, and it was pretty good. It's very different from the original, so try to be open-minded about it. It's good that they use some of the original names like Sarah, Capt. Rhodes, Salazar, Dr. Logan, and Bub. (Who is renamed to Bud in this one.) Some parts remind me of 'Planet Terror' Also in this one, Capt. Rhodes didn't have too big a part and wasn't corrupt like in the original. Dr. Logan is a lot younger but very selfish, and Salazar is black and has those funny one-liners. The zombies are pretty cool. There are a lot of new characters, and some characters from the original have been taken away. Most of the movie takes place at night and they don't get to the underground missile silo until the end of the movie. This one has a lot more action than the original, but I still like the original better because of the gore effects!

In the small town of Colorado, a virus has been spread. The military has been called in to help with the quarantine, and help people throughout the town. Later, the virus spreads even more, and some people take refuge in the hospital, and the radio station. If you love zombie flicks, I highly recommend DAY OF THE DEAD!!!

There are a lot of small details that will annoy the zombie/horror fan here. On their own, they don't matter much, but add them together and you have a very disappointing film.

The acting? I didn't think it was too bad, actually. Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames, although uninspired,  add weight and authority to the story, but unfortunately, they decide to knock off Rhames early in the film and it goes downhill from there.

The zombies? Crucial to a movie like this, of course. The virus storyline is never explored, just mentioned in passing. The zombies actually manage to be even more energetic and athletic than in the previous (and excellent) Dawn of the Dead remake, which is a feat in itself. They run, jump, climb on the ceiling (seriously), snarl, growl, and flail around like spastics with seizures pretty much non-stop. The transformation from infected normal human being to half-rotten zombie with the skin falling off literally takes place in the blink of an eye.

The FX? Generally decent with some really bad CGI thrown in there.

The story? There isn't much of one. Like I said, the virus aspect is briefly mentioned and then ignored. After that, it's business as usual. Running around, lots of screaming, people being killed, OMG What are we going to do, argh, splat, urgh.

3295965,3,B00116GEHU,"When I watched this movie, I was already forewarned how bad others think this movie is from the trailer was released until the time I watched it.

The movie tries so much as to re-vision the original Day of The Dead and incorporate the added thrills of 28 Days Later and the Dawn of The Dead remake. It would've been an okay movie if not for the gimics they put in to try add the scariness factor of the movie, instead of being scary it ended up weird.

In my opinion, it's not as bad as many zombie movies out there. Though, I prefer not to categorize this movie as a zombie flick, since it's more like a viral frenzy thing like that of 28 days and 28 weeks later. I must say that this movie is far better than what Uwe Boll could come up with, and the likes of Day of The Dead 2 and Return of The Living Dead 4 & 5.

It would've been a decent film if not for the wall crawling bit. Probably these were unused shots from Spiderman and Aliens films (those scenes would be great if they made a marvel zombies film on spiderman). It still boggles me how a legless zombie could leap so high.

The CGI of the movie was poorly done and the movie could be better without it. With proper angles and suggestive measures the scenes will be a lot better without involving the CGI bit.

The last 5 seconds of the movie is so corny kind of 70s TV horror shows that the filmakers try very hard for one last scare. It's so obvious and really degrades the movie.

The DVD covers should be replaced by the first poster released early 2007 though it's very clearly seen that the design was a rip off from Land of the Dead, it's still better than what is now being sold to the public. Honestly, the cover depicts on how the critics would rate this film and how many customers might feel after watching it.

After the surprise success of Zack Snyder's surprisingly good Dawn of the Dead remake, a remake of Day of the Dead didn't seem all that far off from happening.  Well, now it's here, and it is indeed an awful, needless remake of George Romero's flawed 1985 classic.  The zombie outbreak is caused by a virus that gets passed around like a cold, which is a nice twist in itself, but really doesn't get used to its full potential.  The zombies themselves do all kinds of crazy things, from crawling on walls and ceilings to leaping around like Spider-Man.  It should be noted that Day of the Dead isn't scary one bit either, and a majority of the gore effects (mainly the CGI head shots) are pretty bad, and the acting (from Ving Rhames, who is not reprising his role from the Dawn of the Dead remake, as well as Mena Suvari and a barely watchable and annoying Nick Cannon) is atrocious.  There was potential here, with veteran horror director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2 & 3, Halloween H20) and writer Jeffrey Reddick (the Final Destination films) at the helm, but alas, Day of the Dead is an awful zombie remake that is a waste of film more than anything else.

Bodies are stashed in closets by ingenious zombies. All in all, Dean Cane's zombie soldier movie sucked but rivaled this monstrousity.",1202688000,4,569,4.578431372549019
3295974,4,B00116GEHU,"Let me just say right up front I went into watching this movie expecting to hate it after reading all the other bad reviews around the net.  I'm a loyal & avid fan of the original & love all of Romero's other ""Dead"" work (the original ""Dawn"" probably being my favorite).  To my utter shock this movie actually wasn't that bad.  Granted this movie was definately not without it's faults, but at least a rental is definately warranted.  Much like the case of the ""Dawn"" remake, had they just called this something else I think this would've gone over alot better.  The movie only loosely has anything at all to do with the original & even than you don't see it until the very end of the movie.  I'm not gonna go into plot really as not to spoil anything for you,

Now for some of the things that bothered me about the movie:

A) The ""outbreak"" comes from a virus that people catch like a cold.
B) This movie unlike the original takes place at the beginning of the outbreak, seems to only last about a day, & seems to only effect this one small Colorado town.
C) Zombies crawling on ceilings is a little ridiculous
D) The cover of the film shows a zombie vomiting, no where in the film does this happen.  It's a stupid cover for a film that people are already expecting to hate; why not dress it up a little & spark some interest
E) I hated the way the zombies change, one second they're perfectly normal & normal looking, the next they're blistery, open soared & rotten looking
F) I hated the amature hour CGI used for alot of the head shots, it reminded me alot of ""Wild Zero"".  While that movie was great, their film was meant to be silly.
G) It was really stupid that zombies hide their victims, A) Why do zombies care who finds them? B)Why didn't these corpses zombify?  Stupid, stupid!!

Now for some of the things I liked about the movie:

A) You get the same fast paced zombies like in the remade ""Dawn"", these ones seem alot more vicious & energetic though
B) For the most part I liked the cast (even Nick Cannon)
C) The story wasn't horrible, just watch it as a zombie movie & not as a ""Day Of The Dead"" remake (which isn't all that hard to do cause they're really not all that similar).
D) Other than the CGI work the film seemed to've had a decent budget, the practical effects were all great, pretty much the only thing you have to worry about being in CGI is blood spray, head shots, oh ya & fire.  The fire scenes are worse than the head shot scenes (just an FYI)

In the end, just go into this expecting to hate it (the cover helps) & you might actually get a kick out of it.  I actually don't regret watching it.  Just watch the movie for what it is.  It's no ""Shaun"", ""Dawn"", or ""Land"", but it's definately far better than ""House Of The Dead 1&2"", ""Day 2-Contagion"", or ""Return 4&5"".  Really though after looking at what I just wrote that's still not saying much.",1200355200,32,2878,4.276752767527675

Spoilers ahead.

Culminating in this one, made probably more out of obligation, connections to the original about as superficial as they come--there's a bunker, there's a soldier named Bud who retains some of his soldier instincts after turning...and that about covers it. Somehow, the zombie virus is explosive when exposed to flame, and the creatures a little more vampiric or troglodyte in demeanor.

This is not on the level of it's predecessor, the original George Romero film of the same title, but I found it quite enjoyable. First, let me say that I'm an avid fan of the George Romero zombie films. I saw the first one at a drive-in theater when I was a teen. If not for Mr. Romero, there would be no flesh-eating zombie genre... no 'Walking Dead' books or television series... makes me shudder to think about it. Should George Romero be deified? ...Probably.
But this is also a good thrilling movie. If you're a fan of lots of action, it's pretty much non-stop after the first twenty-five minutes. Good special effects. Fast moving zombies. One even races across the ceiling tiles to snatch his prey! This isn't decaying corpses rising from graves, but a virus created by some military scientists who eventually fall victim to their own folly.
If you're a George Romero purist, then you'll probably turn your nose up at this one, but if you've somehow acclimated yourself to the fast moving variety of zombie as I have, then you should enjoy this film.",1427846400,,1212,4.641860465116279

The story is careful to avoid explanation; vague references are made to a Project Wildfire and biochemical research.  The usual culprits in stories like this.

There's also a super-zombie who doesn't appear until too late in the mangled mayhem of the story (that at least might have proven interesting but not much is made of him or his prowess).

3296237,2,B00116GEHU,"I enjoy a good zombie flick, but I am by no means a connoisseur of the genre. Regardless of my expertise (or lack thereof), though, Day of the Dead leaves a lot to be desired on all fronts.

First and most important, if you're in search of the Romero film by the same name you can stop reading now, because this isn't it. The similarities between that film and this one begin and end with the title and a couple of shared minor characters. Second, the acting is about as good as the script allows: pleasantly average at best and highly unimaginative and/or cheesy at worst. Third, the plot is as straightforward as they come (kill the zombies), and Day of the Dead fails every time it tries to inject any depth into the story (like character development or the backstory between the lead and her brother).

The biggest drawback for me with this rendition of Day of the Dead is the zombies themselves. I'm something of an elitist when it comes to monster movies; I prefer my vampires to hail from Eastern Europe and be afraid of the light, I want my werewolves vulnerable only to silver bullets, and I like my zombies to be slow, mindless automatons motivated solely by the desire to taste human flesh. The zombies in Day of the Dead do not fit these criteria.

Early in the film, the zombies bounce off the walls everywhere the main characters look. They move incredibly fast, they crawl on ceilings, and they can jump out of third story windows and sprint around without missing a beat. Without any explanation whatsoever, these same zombies are limited to running around at the pace of a quick jog for the entire second half of the film. Worse yet, some zombies demonstrate intelligence, others fire guns (?), and one retains about 50% of his human characteristics and never tries to eat anyone. Another zombie eats part of his own face. Yet another of the creatures passes up a tasty human meal to, again, eat/kill another zombie. My list of complaints goes on, but you get the idea.

I tend to reserve one-star ratings for real bowel-dwellers, only the worst of the worst. While Day of the Dead is above that stature, it also gets worse as it progresses. The dialogue is monotonous and boring, and the ridiculous, eye-roll-inducing finale is frustratingly unoriginal. If you don't enjoy the first half hour of Day of the Dead, you'll hate the rest. My advice is not to waste your time on any of it.",1387065600,,2402,4.579069767441861

I figured this would be poorly written, poorly scripted, poorly shot, poorly acted & *worst* of all -- not even worthy of B-movie status.

I was wrong.

It HAS some redeeming qualities.

Have to admit that I enjoyed the fact that Ving Rhames has a lesser role and Mena & AnnaLynne have stronger ones.

They are still working at it, for sure, but it was especially nice to see Mena *try* to play hard-a**.

She pulls some of it off and some not.

And, yes, the cinematography is *abominable* in several scenes. (even watching in complete darkness, no lights, on my big-a** TV I could hardly make out anything)

DAY OF THE DEAD finds a struggling group of civilians, scientists, and military personnel facing off with a deadly disease that turns its victims into ravenous flesh-eating monsters! The pedestrian script is so deeply embedded in genre cliches that they need not be listed. It is poorly written and poorly acted, despite the re-casting of DAWN OF THE DEAD's Ving Rhames as Captain Rhodes in addition to other recognizable names like Mena Suvari, Nick Cannon, and television's AnnaLynne McCord. Taking the new breed of zombies a step further, Steve Miner's monsters can not only run, but can leap small buildings in a single bound and inexplicably climb the walls and ceilings. The silliness quickly grows out of hand, but this remake sure does pack in a ton of blood! As gory as it is genuinely idiotic, DAY OF THE DEAD somehow manages to retain interest, but only for the good old fashioned Splatter fans. It is best to just forget that this film was even made, and move on to the countless other zombie films that followed in DAWN OF THE DEAD's wake.

Within the first few minutes of this film, both questions were answered. My next question: Why was this awful thing ever released? Well, awful doesn't begin to describe it and one star is way too generous for this remake - which isn't really a remake. This is a clumsy and feeble ""reimagined"" version of the George Romero classic. Believe me, I sat through plenty of clunker horror films in my time, but this is nearly unwatchable. Not only do I want my $2 back, I'm inclined to sue for compensatory damages to my senses. All of the parties responsible for this travesty should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. On paper, the cast looks promising, but I can't help but say: Ving Rhames and Mena Suvari - really?!? Shame on you. If you take the shameful acting, lousy script, terrible story, godawful makeup, ridiculous effects, and gross misuse of a classic horror film title off the table and concentrate only on the horror aspect of film, it stands as possibly the worst zombie genre film ever made. According to this ""reimagining,"" dying a horrible death (which this movie should have done) heightens one's strength, speed and wall/ceiling-climbing abilities. The film's effects team (a term I use loosely) jerkily accelerate the speed the film in order to make the zombies appear to move with superhuman quickness. The effect is painfully obvious and only causes the viewer to regret choosing to watch this atrocity. Sadly, the living are even less realistic than the undead. Suvari portrays (again, loose term) a tough-as-nails officer in the armed forces who doesn't carry a loaded gun. Um, hello?!? Zombies! Among the main characters: A vegetarian zombie who refuses to eat human flesh. Wow. It's difficult to be scared when you're too busy laughing.",1325635200,,1892,4.8246153846153845

The only things in common are the names of some of the characters like Captain Rhodes and the idea that the military working with the scientists against the zombies while having been used by our government theme, yeah okay - been there, done that how many times now?

Acting? It's OK. Nothing special. No one walked away with any awards fr their parts played.

Special effects? Variable; some are good, some are not so good. Mostly the effects were average across the board.

Plot? Plot.  Oh yeah, a plot!  Zombies eat people, people blow up zombies, and that's about the extent of it. Turn off your brain for this one, because you will lose active cells.

While Miner's ""remake"" has none of the style or finesse of the Romero films, it's still an enjoyable enough zombie action shoot-'em-up and watch the heads fly movie.

Still it has alot of good points to it. If this were a effort that had nothing to do with that movie I would have said average three star  low budget zombie flick! But this one was made in probably Romania or someplace and it has zombies that mutate into cieling crawling things and explode when on fire. In other words it has it's own zombie mythos.

It's ok though with decent acting from the main actors who have all been around for years. Mena S. deserves to be in a better horror moive than this though, she's got real acting chops.  IN fact you can't fault any actor for this movie. Most horror movies are low budget and well you can't even use the same rating system that regular movies get probably.  This one though has a flat looking blu ray transfer that you usually see on older movies from the 80's. they would have to restore those to make them look better, and this is a newer movie!  The effects are low budget and that's ok though because this is a low budger flick. But alot higher than many zombie flicks out there that I enjoy! It's just saying it's inspired by Romero that pulls this down. However it's watchable for zombie fans and lets face it , it's not as bad as lots of other even lower budget zombie fests out there.

3296374,3,B00116GEHU,"The truth is, Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" is arguably the weakest of Romero's zombie films. Romero had a much grander vision for ""Day of the Dead,"" but he would not agree to toning down the film's gore to achieve an ""R"" rating.

The result was  a hastily re-written script, a plodding pace, and a generally lackluster film.  The music of Romero's ""Day"" is also quite dull, especially compared to the music of its predecessor ""Dawn of the Dead.""

So in many ways, Romero's film was problematic in its own right; it lacked much of humor, depth and social commentary that made its predecessor great.

To those of you who say that this ""isn't like Romero's version,"" I say well, so what?

 Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" does not deserve the same reverence that ""Dawn"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" deserve. It's not a great film and it's hardly a 'horror classic' in the same way that it's two predecessors are.

In some ways, this newer Day of the Dead  improves upon Romero's. The dreary, lackluster salt mines of the original film are replaced with more diverse settings. The zombies are faster, stronger, and more interesting.

This 2008 film is not great either, which is the main similarity to Romero's film. It's a passable, if somewhat mediocre Zombie film, just like Romero's original.  While very different in terms of plot, they are alike in the sense that they could have used something extra.

3296397,2,B00116GEHU,"Few things irk me more than a movie with a ridiculously implausible military presence.  If there were a massive quarantine effort or a cover-up of a zombie outbreak in Leadville, CO, surely there wouldn't be privates calling corporals ""ma'am,"" and there is no way the entire effort would not be led by a Captain.  This is all unacceptable considering a fresh out of Basic Training Private would know better.

Speaking of that, Captain Black Earlydeath (Ving Rhames) is put in charge of a massive quarantine effort when there is a mysterious outbreak with flu-like symptoms.  His top assistant is Corporal Powertrip (Mena Suvari), who walks around with the power and sense of entitlement of someone who has not been in the service less than three years.  It's up to them and two newbies - Private Irritating (Nick Cannon) and Private Zombie (Stark Sands) - to band together for survival.

The problem with their plan is that the zombies in this movie can think and reason, use tools, and walk on ceilings.  Good thing the local gun store is completely empty, RIGHT AFTER a zombie outbreak.  It's also fortunate that Private Zombie has not only switched sides (from Z to human), but he's also brainlessly reliable enough to walk trail when the group goes on patrol.  Because he's in love with Suvari.  Seriously.  And that's just the beginning of the logical inconsistencies in this slap in the face to the zombie genre.

The major flaw (of which there are many) with this movie is that not a single character is likeable.  I wanted them all to die.  Suvari, who is rarely likeable, is inserted just for the clichd ""tough girl in charge""-routine, and Cannon signed up so he could do all the scenes he thinks are cool (e.g. two handguns pointed in different directions).  Aside from the previously mentioned ceiling crawl, ala The Grudge, these zombies blow up like charcoal briquettes when they encounter flames.  Zombie vampires?  The major positive is the gore, blood spatter, etc.  The content will satisfy most gorehounds.

Point blank, this movie sucks.  It would have been better if Ving Rhames survived and Mena Suvari was torn apart until there was nothing but viscera and arm-kebabs for the hungry zombies.  This is a disgrace and should have never been allowed to carry a Romero title.

The main reason I watched this was because I have recently seen Zombieland, Outpost and Diary Of The Dead and said to myself ""wow, some of these newer zombie movies are pretty good"". If your looking for a remake or sequel of some kind to Romero's series you won't find it here. The unoriginal plot is a mish mash of other zombie films, but it leans heavily on the 28 Days / Weeks movies. The zombies' actions are so obviously computerized that at times this movie looks more like a video game. The zombies look fairly cool, but when you see them move you'll be pretty upset by how absurd and stupid they look. The camera tricks using fast motion gets old after about 2 minutes and the beginning drags along at a slow pace even though the zombies don't do the same. I was never a fan of the fast zombie character, but some fast zombie / infected movies do stand out as decent films. Day Of The Dead 2008 is definitely not a stand out. I'd only recommend it for zombie movie completists.",1280361600,,1186,4.275555555555556

Considering that Romero's was made in 1985 you would think the special effects would be so much better.

3296401,3,B00116GEHU,"The original ""Day of the Dead"" was a cult classic with ""Bub"" being the world's most favorite zombie. This movie did not follow in line with the original except for the fact they had one friendly vegan zombie. Nor did this movie follow the logical sequence of ""Night of the Living Dead"", or ""Dawn of the Dead."" Instead it seemed more like a bad prequel for ""Return of the Living Dead.""

The zombies in this one are not dead people coming back to life, but rather live people infected by a virus. They don't walk slow. In fact they move around a bit like the vampires in ""Twilight."" It doesn't take a head shot to kill them either. If you recall the research done in the original ""Day of the Dead"" explained why the head shot was needed. The movie starts out as a 5 star production. The character interaction was good. The plot and subplot ran close together. The slow scenes, needed to build plot, were done well as they were aptly inter-spaced with action scenes. I broke out the popcorn waiting for a modern zombie classic to unfold. It never did. Once the zombies came into being, the movie quickly degenerated into a ""B"" zombie movie. I always wondered what the guy at America AM in Colorado looked like.

I really saw it as a mix between Day of the Dead and Return of the living dead (both great movies).  An though it lives up to neither of them, it was still worth watching.  Also the zombies are much faster and more brutal!

So in closing if you like violent, gross, high speed zombie movies then you really should find this movie at least entertaining.  Just remember this is not George Romero's classic Day of the Dead.",1275350400,,752,4.366906474820144
3296403,2,B00116GEHU,"It was only inevitable. Someday, somebody somewhere would remake the third film in the legendary zombie saga helmed by George A. Romero. First, there was Tom Savini's directorial debut with a remake of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>,"" which was a load of nostalgic fun for genre fans. Then, Zack Snyder spun the genre on its head with his ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002ABURA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>"" remake that helped usher in a new generation of zombie flicks (as well as a long-awaited return to the genre from Romero himself in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Dead/dp/B000B2YR7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Dead</a>"") and now here we are, for better or for worse, with an update of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead</a>"".

Unfortunately, it's for the worse. Director Steve Miner, who himself has a respectable track record with films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-H20/dp/6305291446/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween H20</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House/dp/B000069HP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House</a>,"" seemed like an okay choice for the job, yet the end result is a film that is sloppy and unprofessional on nearly each and every front. In this version of the film, the military -- which includes Mena Suvari in a career-killing role sporting unflattering fatigues -- is brought in to quarantine a small town after an outbreak spread by a common cold is turning its citizens into the living dead. Along for the ride are Ving Rhames -- not reprising his role from the ""Dawn of the Dead"" -- and Nick Cannon, as a wise-cracking, albeit, irritating force to be reckoned with.

The film was originally intended for theatrical release but was shelved for a few years before seeing the light of day, and it's easy to see why after witnessing the mess that it truly is. The CGI is downright awful, and is rivaled only by the pathetic excuse for acting from Cannon and some of the lesser known actors who portray the teenagers. There are some twists on the original that, while hardly effective, are at least admirable. Bub, the loveable zombie from Romero's original, is transformed into Bud, a love-struck vegetarian zombie. Unfortunately, this whole bit is so silly you can almost hear the sound of palms hitting faces behind the scenes. To his credit, Miner puts on a fast-paced show that keeps the pain to a minimum. At the very least, zombie fans will find some cheap thrills in this ""Day of the Dead"" redux, but serious horror fans and George A.

3296436,1,B00116GEHU,"Since Dawn of The Dead was also remade, it seems like studios are quick to cash in on the ""zombie"" phenomenom.  Yes, you can make vague comments about materialism and ""so what"" if this isn't ground that has been trod before.

Sure, the zombies move faster and the ""shock"" factor is more constant and is no longer juxtaposed against calm suburban life.  That, of course, isn't why this film deserves, well ""negative stars"".

It's a remake made by someone who apparently did not even watch the original.  Really.

In the original film, the zombie attack has already happened and soldiers and scientists have holed up in a military base where they perform experiments on the zombies.  There is no ""shots of the outbreak"" as the whole point of the film is entirely different.  It's more about tensions between the characters, with most of the action happening at the tail of the film.

This is not that film, this isn't even the same story.

Instead, it starts off in ""Leadville, Colorado"" (which is actually shot in Bulgaria and LA... it looks nothing like Leadville) where the outbreak starts and, in a fairly made for television fashion, soldiers quarantine the town and zombieness ensues.  It's shot at the level of a SciFi channel original (which, let's be fair, might have better acting) and it should have surprised no one that this film went the ""straight to dvd"" route.  Mena Suvari does a poor job of playing a soldier, instead she just seems to have stumbled into a set of fatigues.  Nick Cannon takes a turn that, while a complete stretch for an actor of his versatility, really doesn't fit with the movie (he plays a teenager playing at soldier, who uses gangster slang and seems to enjoy guns too much to actually be a professional soldier).  Ving Rhames has a very brief stint as a ""hard nose"" captain, and let's be honest, he's playing ""Ving Rhames"" (let's call a spade a spade) so in his ""Ving Rhamesy"" role he does a good job.  If you like Ving Rhames.

I'd warn you that I'm about to hit ""spoiler county"", but you can probably guess the plot from here: it's a military experiment gone wrong, and as they learn this, some folks die.  Yup.  Again, this has nothing to do with the original, at all, (in which they were experimenting with zombies but did not ""make the virus"").  Run from zombies who move awfully fast, toss in some nonsensical CGI, cop your lighting style from ""Planet Terror"" and call it a day.

Really, if you are a fan of the original Romero movies and even vaguely recall the original (maybe you saw it on television) you can recognize this for what it is: horrible, horrible, horrible.  Everyone involve should be forced to wear a scarlet letter (in this case an F for fraud), because they failed the first lesson of a remake: watch the original film.  It's not enough to just put zombies in your script... you kind of need to be somewhat close to the original story.

3296439,1,B00116GEHU,"Okay, so let me get this straight, just because they took the title of the original George Romero film it gets to be based on it? I have seen the worst of the worst when it comes to Zombie flicks as I am a huge fan. Just as an idea, House of the Dead is, in my opinion, the absolute worst Zombie film ever. Why? Heavy duty budget and not even a small bit of the film looks like it was spent on the movie itself. Plain and simeple. Now, taking that logic, let's look at this train wreck of a film.

First of all, the characters in this film have the names of the characters from the original, and that is about where the similarities between the films stop. I so wanted this to be a good film. The ""Remake"" of Dawn of the Dead, while not really a remake, was at least okay to call Dawn of the Dead as it at least had the idea of the film taking place in a mall surrounded by Zombies and a group of people trying to survive a Hellish Zombie outbreak. As for this piece of crap, the only part of the film that takes place underground, supposedly, is the very end. Sarah is now an Army recruit, Dr. Logan, nicknamed ""Frankenstein"" in the original, is now a serious bad guy, Bub is also a member of the army who becomes a Zombie but will listen to Sarah because he is in love with her(?), and lastly, let's get to Rhodes. In the original film, you hated him. Joseph Pilato made himself a cult icon in horror for his portrayal of Captain Rhodes. His sharp tonged lashings and over the top paranoia made him the real bad guy in the film. His insanity was scarier than the Zombies this group of Scientists and Army outfit were trying to survive. Ving Rhames as Rhodes is horrid. I am sure it has nothing to do with him as an actor as he has been damn good in everything else he has been in, but this script so waters down this character, you really don't know what a jerk he was in the original.

The great things about the George Romero Zombie films is that the Zombies are not the center of the story, the people in the situation they are in are. I do have respect for Steve Miner in some regards as I am a huge fan of his film ""House"" but he really should have done something else with this film. The story is weak and ill conceived along with the dialogue, the acting is just bad, the special effects are not the greatest, and the zombies themselves are just rotten, and not in a good Zombie flick kind of way either. Really, if you want to see ""Day of the Dead"" go get the original and enjoy an excellently done Zombie film that is worth watching.

3296440,3,B00116GEHU,"A strange flu outbreak.

Nose bleeds.

Death.

Rebirth . . . in rage.

No one knows how anyone got sick . . . at least, no one is telling us. The US Army is all over it, quarantining Leadville, Colorado. Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) is serving her country and is part of the troops bordering the town.

Except they can't contain the rage-filled maniacs that have returned from the dead after being killed by the flu.

Going back for her mother (Linda Marlowe), she runs into her brother, Trevor (Michael Welch), and tries and save their mother's life. Unfortunately, the mom falls victim to the virus and Sarah and her brother--along with his girlfriend/female interest, Nina (AnnaLynne McCord), and a couple of Army Joes--try and flee from the ever-escalating attack of flesh-hungry zombies that stop at nothing to satisfy their gut-munching desires.

Adding a strange twist to things, one of the army chaps, Bud Crain (Stark Sands), gets infected and later transforms into an angry zombie as well, but Sarah keeps him along for the ride, feeling sorry for him. Besides, he seems harmless enough and hasn't attacked them.

When their hope of escape falls through, Sarah and the others must make their last stand against the undead before they are ripped to pieces.

Can they survive this Day of the Dead?

The first thing that comes to mind about this movie is that it's hardcore. The zombies in this flick aren't just your average gray-skinned, baggy-eyed monsters. The person infected dies then are suddenly transformed into pale-skinned, decayed-fleshed, white-eyed beasties loaded with so much rage that hate and hunger emanates from them before they even move in for the kill. Speaking of which, they move so fast you'd think they're part vampire or something. Crazy speed with these guys and, for me, those quick, jerky movements of the undead creep me out every time.

The story's simple: an outbreak, people turn into zombies, folks run for their lives. Hey, standard zombie fare, and that's part of the fun. I also liked having a female in the lead and it was neat to see Mena Suvari--who usually plays the fun, get-along girl--take charge and blast the heads off these creatures.

I was totally into this flick. The suspense was building. Every time a zombie jumped out I was jumping on my couch. All good.

Then Bud died, came back--and was nice? This bit took me out of the movie and it's why I'm giving this a 3 out of 5 instead of a 4 like I was going to. It just totally ruined it for me, especially when Sarah and friends were riding with him in the Humvee and, after a short debate about why this zombie was riding with them, they all seemed pretty cool with it.

Bud's bit at the end was also predictable, but, hey, what're you gonna do?

I did like how vulnerable these zombies were to fire and how quickly the flames destroyed them.

The ending director Steve Miner chose for this flick was the better of the two as the alternate ending on the DVD, though very similar, wasn't as strong and was a bit hokey. Having Salazar (Nick Cannon) die was the best choice.

If you like your zombie flicks raunchy, quick and gory, you'll love this Day of the Dead remake. If you're one of those folks who are sticky about story plausibility--even in the realm of zombie movies--then this probably won't be up your alley.

This film, if you can call it that, belongs somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. It's just that bad. Ving Rhames' character as the infamous Capt. Rhodes was short-lived and he went down in a crowd of zombies without a fight or awesome last words. He was just dragged off into another room and that was the end.

The zombies are terrible, I mean absolutely horrendous in the makeup department. They looked like someone threw up acrylic paint and dumped it on 300 extras, then added some latex for effect. What really took the cake was how the zombies could do an acrobatic leap off a ten story building and not splatter, or crawl on a roof like some human-cheetah-spider-gecko hybrid make it totally lame.

The dialogue is trite and hackneyed, the typical teenagers making out in the woods and killed marks the beginning and the rest looks like a bad made for Sci-Fi movie. More than anything, the film insults the viewers at every corner. Sadly, it's just an excuse for Nick Cannon to shoot his mouth of every five minutes to the point you cheer when the zombies get him.

The sad excuse for a ""trained zombie"" here aptly named Bud (they can't use BUB because they'd get sued by Romero), doesn't eat people because he's a vegetarian zombie (?????).

The story makes no sense at all just the same. One of the most ridiculous scares in movie history occurs when the soldiers enter a trailer. The overused disheveled appearance and blood streaks indicate violence of some nature all the way to the bedroom and end at strategically placed comforter on the floor. They turn it over expecting, wait for it..., nothing to jump out. The other soldier still manages to freak and bump some curtains behind, through which two severely mangled bodies are mysteriously standing up straight to fall out on him (?).

Worse, police officers show up randomly and find three bodies(?) this time then, wait for it, the power suddenly goes out to the whole town. Then a zombie mircalously jumps out of the dark and manages to take out four very well armed men without taking a bullet.(?)

Confused yet? Well it gets worse. The moment the power goes out, the worker (who is for some unknown reason still working on the place after dark) see some ""shadows"" walk out of the dark. The worker begins talking to them and the zombies jump on her, sending her into a strategically placed electrode thingy on the floor. Her blood suddenly shorts it out and all the power to town goes out(?).

To make matters worse, the zombies go from normal to super rotten in just under five seconds. If a body decayed that fast, they would be stumbling not running an Olympic Marathon to kill someone.

Then for some reason the scientist who created the zombie virus is that tall guy from the early seasons of Mad TV, you know that guy that played Stan the Java Man with his eyes bugging out and permanently whipped up on caffeine. Yeah I started laughing when he changed into a zombie... wait I thought was trying to be serious.

Then it ends with that classic all is well endings, and zombie suddenly jumps at the camera to get in that ""Oh S---"" scare at the end. Yeah, I was ready to put more holes in my wall than the Dawn of the Dead Remake I busted by guitar getting excited over.

With this movie, all bets are off at owning or even viewing it. Next time block the channel it's playing on to keep from destroying your eyes, should you happen across it late in the wee hours of the morning when nothing else is good on. Better yet, when you see it, turn off the TV and go to bed. You're better off saving that hour or so of your time.",1262044800,10,3874,4.449929478138223

3296475,1,B00116GEHU,"The best thing about ""Day of the Dead"" (2008) is its short running time. It is only 86 minutes. The 86 minutes of your life will be wasted, though.

People living in a small Colorado town are infected with an unknown disease, which turn them into flesh-eating zombies. The generic story doesn't even bother to explain to us why certain characters are immune to the deadly airborne disease, but never mind. This is the town where a soldier named Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) is born and raised, and Sarah, sent there to quarantine the town, visits her home to discover that the situation is worse than she expected.

The story is nothing special, an average one. Strangely, though the new film uses the name of George A. Romero's film of the same name made in 1985 (his name is credited in the opening), the storyline is completely different, as you may have noticed, except some key elements. But the difference doesn't end there, as zombies in the new ""DODD"" can not only run; they are also capable of using weapons, jumping from upstairs window and crawling on the ceiling like a lizard. So, what is the point of using Romero's name?

The film is fast-paced, but it has no rhythm. Actions are weak and shoddily edited. Things don't get better with the wooden acting from the stars (including Nick Cannon and a short cameo by Ving Rhames) and the bland direction of Steve Miner (""Lake Placid"") and his shaky camera. Even the character of ""Bud, who could have been much more interesting, failed to impress us, as he is not given a chance to show what he can do.

Then I watched the original again and after that I watched the re-imagining another time and the second time I saw it I loved it! The original is a little too slow and boring for me now days, I use to like it when I was younger, but now when I see the old one I keep catching myself thinking ""when the hell is something gonna happen""?
The new re-imagining of the movie is the total opposite and is filled with action and the newer ""fast zombies"" which can run, jump and all that good stuff and yeah it is intense... I read a few reviews about somebody said ""Zombies can't shoot guns and they can't think at all"" or something and that was one of their complaints about the movie.. Well if they really think that, I think they should take another look at George Romero's original Day of the Dead, because the zombie ""Bub"" actually is learning how to do things and he also does shoot a gun in that movie. The same thing happens once again in Land of the dead, so the argument that zombies can't do any of that is just stupid.
Anyway back to this movie... If you want to watch a zombie movie that is intense and has a lot of action and that really will keep you at the edge of your seat, then watch Day of the Dead. It's a good movie, but when you watch it you have to keep an open mind and not think too much about the original. Just take it for what it is and it will be very entertaining. It's not as good as the re imagining of Dawn of the dead, but it still does a great job on keeping you entertained!

3296480,1,B00116GEHU,"Oooof! This lousy flick was like a sucker-punch to the kidneys! I just don't get how this movie turned out so lousy?! In this supposed update of Romero's third ""Dead"" movie, nothing works, and that really suprised me. First of all you have Steve Miner helming the film, and he's no slouch in pulling off a great horror sequel (Friday the 13th 2 & 3, Halloween H20), and he's working with some top tier actors as well, Ving Rhames and Mean Suvari. And to top if off, ""Day of the Dead"" is probably the weakest of Romero's original ""Dead"" films, and could have easily been remade in better fashion.
Instead we are stuck with this thing...oh, and ""Day of the Dead 2: Contagion"" which was awful, but excusable considering it had no budget, not studio, no named stars or decent effects. This ""Day of the Dead"" had no excuse for being this awful.
The basic storyline is that a small town is quarantined as a strange epidemic begins sweeping the country. The dead are returning to life and eating the living. Rhames basically gets an extended cameo, while Suvari is the star of the film playing a National Guard soldier who must fight to survive the onslaught of corpses with the munchies.

Of course, when the dead come back, they are covered in puss-oozing wounds, have the ability to run super-fast, crawl on ceilings...in short not only does this film use ""fast zombies"" they now exhibit super-human abilities??!! The gore effect at times can be effective, but nothing we haven't seen before. The storyline jumps around a bit, and the dialog is laughably awful.

In short, while Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" may be considered too talky for some, at least it stayed within the boundaries set by the genre. The remake tries to do something new with the zombies, and it simply fails at every level.",1244419200,,1789,4.640378548895899

It was a nice nod to the classic 1985 film.

Now the bad things about this film.
The film introduces a ridiculous new element: the people are sick and in a matter of two seconds, they become rotten zombies. Snap! Just like that. And some of them are so ferocious they even climb through ceilings. And something else: zombies are flammable! LOL These are such dumb ideas.

The makeup is not bad, but we've seen a lot better.

This is another American horror film shot in eastern Europe and we can clearly see how such option (no matter how much money it saves) is limited when it comes to locations. Too limited in my opinion. This is a trend in today's horror films. But it is true: you try to make Romania or Bulgaria to look like the United States... and you are restricted to the woods, one street and some shabby old military buildings.

And something else: after a nice first half where the small Colorado city where the action takes place gets devoured, the last quarter of the film is spent inside a military secret compound (a cheap set built in a soundstage). In other words, instead of delivering a great ending, the film decides to save money in its last quarter.

All these elements probably brought the film down from receiving a wide release. It looks too cheap even with all the good points I already explained. It's simply an underachiever.

And how did they come up with that idea for the DVD cover? A zombie throwing up? What does that have to do with anything?

I'd still would like to see Mr. Miner directing something better produced and written.",1240012800,,3447,6.818181818181818
3296484,2,B00116GEHU,"From the beginning to the very end.  This movie feels like it was taken from a sub-par horror video game and made direct to video.  With that said you now know where it's headed and if you hate cheesy video game horror movies avoid.  If you kinda like them than this one is alright.
  As for George A Romero.  I think he just sold out the name ""Day of the Dead"" Which is too bad.  Cause I liked his approved ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" remakes. Both were good remakes with a new directors view and vision for the time they came out.

  Why does this feel more like a video game? It's due to the way the scenes cut during action sequences.  Also, the final confrontation i felt like I should be mashing the x butten to pull this and then enter some other combo to move the character to safety.  It really had that forced kinda nuttyness to it. Ie the classic video game rail shooter movement choices left for the characters to pull off/do.

3296505,2,B00116GEHU,"Wow, just wow.  I didn't know the true depth of places in the mind and in the imagination of a filmmaker the art of movies could take me.  Of course, that was all in the past, the past before I viewed the masterpiece of originality, despite it being a remake of a film made over 20 years ago, called Day Of The Dead!  Also, despite the fact that it was not the first film made involving the undead or zombies, especially in recent years. What a novel idea!  Hey, even though there's tons of theatrical and direct-to-video zombie films out there right now and in the past, we'll make another one, but just not any zombie flick, the definitive zombie flick for which all others will be judged and held up to as a template.  It's here.  I thought it would be the second coming of Christ, but it was Day of the Dead, directed with pure brilliance by the aptly described 'brilliant' director, Steve Miner.  Yes, the same Steve Miner behind the cinematic masterpieces like Friday the 13th part 3-d, Lake Placid, Texas Rangers, House, and the ultimate Mel Gibson film, his magnum opus if you will, Forever Young.  Ah, yes I found my cinematic bliss.  Almost thirty years and there it was at my local video store.

Firstly, lets talk about what this film does right, nay, brilliantly.
1. It doesn't waste any time, none, giving the characters depth.  They're  simple-to-digest cyphers there to keep the action moving.  You don't even need to know their names, though the film was goodly enough to provide names.  There's the tough girl, the smart-alecky black guy, the old grizzled soldier, the rookie, and the little brother and his hot girlfriend.  See!?  They simplified it for mass consumption.  Just know genders, and know the one human attitude each contains and you'll be fine.  Sure, you won't relate to, or really care about them or their fate, but you won't get confused either.  Ooh, I just got a shiver from the sheer memory of these immortalized-on-film group of characters.
2. They throw us something new, something innovative and vital to the art of storytelling in any medium.  They give us not only the recently popular fast moving, running zombies, they give us super-strengthed, wall and ceiling crawling zombies. Stop laughing.  It's not like they are web slinging zombies, though that would've pushed the film from brilliant to revolutionary!  Why would zombies that for all intenssive purposes are dying and rotting run or have super strength?  How are they able to cling to walls and ceilings even though the script doesn't give us any info telling us that have grown bits of stick-'em on their palms?  Why ask?  These are logical questions that have no room in a film about the dead coming back to life.  It's ambiguous like Fargo, No Country For Old Men, The Man Who Fell To Earth and other great films.  Don't be sooo anal.  Just enjoy the fact that the director thought so much about your intelligence and capacity to be entertained by giving us something new and never before seen.  WALL CRAWLING ZOMBIES!!!  Oh yeah.
3. The film doesn't bore us with a complex plot or a way to transcend the tired but true story of men and women out running, out smarting, and hiding from zombies.  They barely even give us a plot.  In other words they did us the favor of cutting out the boring parts.  It's just montage filmmaking from one brilliant action set piece to another.
4. They threw in master thespian Ving Rhames.  Does he play the same character from Dawn of the Dead remake?  NOPE!  But, I'm sure they wanted you to think so.  Some may say this is a nefarious trick on the movie going public.  I say, BAH.  I know I smiled as I sat and realised that he was just in this film to tie him to the previous remake.  I was like, ""You bunch of rascally filmmakers, you got me.  You got me good.""  It's like a good practical joke.  Everyone smiles after all is said and done.
5. Trying new things with CGI.  I know all those supposedly big shot filmmakers in Hollywood have tried to hone the art of CGI to bring a larger sense of realism and gradeur to their 'films'.  Day of the Dead remake knows better.  Some may say that the CGI was cheap, and if they couldn't afford to do it well, then they should have done it practically, like older films with make-up and puppet effects.  Shut your mouth, and never think those thoughts again!!!!  This film has the most brilliant CGI ever committed to film.  Anyone can bring dinasaurs to life, that's soooo 1993, but blowing up yellow zombies' heads in full panoramic awesomeness is what the destiny of CGI was built for.  It may have not known that, but do any of us know our ture destinies?

Now onto the film's faults...WAIT, THERE ARE NONE!  I know you thought there was going to be a pro's vs. cons list for this piece, based on my structure, but that's all part and parcel to the mind altering nature of this amazing film.  It changes your mind, your perceptions, your body.  Kind of like the over-rated piece of crap Videodrome, directed by that hack of empty ideas, David Cronenberg, but good.

Some have complained about the midleading nature of the cover artwork, a zombie spewing green vomit and various body parts.  I say, you're just not looking between the lines.  This is not simply some cheap ploy masquerading as cover art, but rather a statement.  Obviously, the gentlemen on the cover saw this film, and was so empowered by the sheer grandiose brilliance contained within he could no longer control his bodily functions.  The filmmakers and cover art designers knew they had a monumental achievement on their hands and rather then simply give us a cover that clued us into the film's content, they gave us something more subliminal.  Amazing.  The movie's greatness goes beyond the actual film and into all aspects regarding it.

Steve Miner is just sitting back and waiting for his DGA lifetime acheivment award.  When that glorious day comes directors like Steven Spielberg, Martin Scoreses, Fracis Coppola, and Alfred Hitchcock's ghost will all have to hide their heads in shame.  For they will have realised that they have wasted their lives, their careers and the the lives of all that have worked for them on their silly efforts.  They may have projected the knowledge of what it feels like to dent the ether of pop-culture with their 'films', but will realise they only wiped their feet on the door matt of greatness.  The word 'greatness' itself will have to be changed accordingly as well.  ""That new flavor of Ben and Jerry's ice-cream was great"", will have to be transformed to ""That new flavor of Ben and Jerry's ice-cream was Day of the Dead remake!""  Oh, the times are chaning and finally for the better.

The dvd itself is indescribeable.  I was going to listen to the film's commentary but then I saw that Steve Miner was on it.  I knew now that I couldn't and I truly didn't have the right to hear the great man's thoughts on his masterpiece.  The minute the first syllable of his first thought's word passes his lips and through my speakers I knew I would run the risk of my head exploding.  I'm not ready.  I hope one day I am, and I can attempt to hear and accept his gospel.  The culmination of my life from this point on will be a wait for that glorious day.  Sigh...  I would suggest that all buy at least two copies of this film on dvd.  One to watch, and one to make sweet love to.  Take my advice, making love to a disc while it is in the dvd player can lead to uncomfortable situations and lots of pain.  This way you can watch the film and truly love it the way it was intended.  And if your love becomes too intense and you break Day of the Dead remake, don't fret.  Nothing can destroy this film.  There will always be more copies at any store, especially Amazon, where they are sold on the ultra cheap side.  Some may say that the amount of used dvds sold on this site is due to the film not being liked by those who blindly bought it without seeing it.  Yeah, RIGHT!  These people are faithful followers to the true teachings of this wonderful film.  They are sacrificing their own pleasure in the form of a used dvd to give up to the less fortunate.  If one of us can't experience this film, then none of us should.

GREATEST FILM I ever saw!!!!  You may disagree, but like all those made in sin, it's your nature to rebel.  Submit today, submit tomorrow, all will become legion with this brilliant film.  Did I mention that I thought it was brilliant?

PS: I know sarcasm doesn't translate that great in the typed word, so I hope the actual star rating I assigned this film clears any confusion up on what I really think it's worth.  If not, then you are obviously mildly retarded and unsupervised.  You know you're not supposed to using the computer!  Not get back in  your pen!",1238198400,,8787,4.525111252383979
3296506,4,B00116GEHU,"I've read some negative reviews for this remake, but I thought it was pretty good. It's very different from the original, so try to be open-minded about it. It's good that they use some of the original names like Sarah, Capt. Rhodes, Salazar, Dr. Logan, and Bub. (Who is renamed to Bud in this one.) Some parts remind me of 'Planet Terror' Also in this one, Capt. Rhodes didn't have too big a part and wasn't corrupt like in the original. Dr. Logan is a lot younger but very selfish, and Salazar is black and has those funny one-liners. The zombies are pretty cool. There are a lot of new characters, and some characters from the original have been taken away. Most of the movie takes place at night and they don't get to the underground missile silo until the end of the movie. This one has a lot more action than the original, but I still like the original better because of the gore effects!

In the small town of Colorado, a virus has been spread. The military has been called in to help with the quarantine, and help people throughout the town.

The movie is set in a small town in Colorado that becomes infected by an unknown virus that turns people into zombies. As the virus takes its toll on the townspeople, a group of soldiers and towns folks must survive until dawn. Characters include Corporal Sarah Cross (Mena Suvari), Private Salazar (Nick Cannon), and Private Bud Crain (Stark Sands). Ving Rhames (who was in the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) plays a short part as well.

The zombie creation method in this version of Day of the Dead totally differs from Romero's version. Instead of some unknown cause turning people into zombies, the movie explicitly shows that its some type of engineered virus. Interestingly enough, they never really explain why some townspeople are infected and some are not. Anyways, the zombies do retain some part of their former life. Like the original, one of the zombies (Pvt. Bud) ends up helping the survivors. Also like the original, the movie does involve a missile silo.

The story goes like this, the military is sent in to enforce a quarantine in a small town, which has come down with a flu like virus, causing the townfolk to turn into zombies, with all hell breaking lose the survivors must fight to get out.

We all know why this film got runed down so we don't need to go there, so let's look at the posatives, the film stands on it's own as a good zombie film, it has all the blood and gore you expect from one and it's the type of the film where you can just switch off your brain for a weekend movie to watch.

The film is not ground breaking but it's not bad either, it just had the misfortune of being branded a remake, when everybody knows it's not.

I wasn't expecting a faithful adaptation of Romero's original, I was actually expecting it to follow on from the mediocre but not so terrible ""Dawn of the Dead"" 're-make', partly because Ving Rhames is in it. In fact this new film has absolutely nothing to do with either and gradually degenerates into what I can only describe as a spoof. In fact, the film takes itself seriously at the beginning but when it becomes clear that the director has run out of ideas, it turns into spoof and a particularly poor spoof at that.

The Romero original films were somewhat cerebral (bar the obvious 'Land of the Dead') insofar as they had some sort of point to make about the nature of man. I think 'Day of the Dead' achieved this most successfully by concentrating on the deteriorating relations between the few survivors  from different facets of life, rather than on zombie vs human action (which only really happens at the end of the film). Okay, the characters were stereotyped and only semi-credible; nevertheless, the vision of man creating 'hell on Earth' (sprinkled with allusions to Dante's 'Inferno') and the futility of the attempts of the lead character Sarah in trying to bring everyone together in order to save not only themselves but potentially the human race was aptly exposed as the military, the scientific community and all else were shown as following their own agenda, to paraphrase the helicopter pilot: ""That's the trouble with the world Sarah, everyone has different ideas concerning what they want out of life"". The zombies outside the compound in which the remaining humans resided were effective representatives of the 'dumb masses' needing to be kept at bay by the powerful few. The enduring image of the film is one of egotistical and power-obsessed men struggling to assert supremacy over a world that is worth little.

In sum, the film had a point and dramatically it was well realized, much suspense and (at least some) interesting characterization.

The fact that this film shares the same name and therefore implies that it has some resemblance to the original is a gross insult to the original that actually was driven by a vision. This new film is utterly pathetic and is typical of modern Hollywood films, particularly horror films, that are generally aimed at the under 18s, in terms of age, or the under 100s, in terms of IQ.

3296536,3,B00116GEHU,"Day of the Dead (Steve Miner, 2008)

Okay, let's get this out of the way first: Steve Miner's brand-spanking-new Day of the Dead is neither a remake of George Romero's 1985 film of the same name-- it borrows a few concepts, but the execution is entirely different-- and, despite the presence of Ving Rhames, it is also not a sequel to Zack Snyder's 2004 not-really-a-remake of Dawn of the Dead. Comparing the two, however, the new Dawn was, in comparison, slavishly faithful. Yeah, I mean, this really isn't a remake. For all that, however, I was very pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable the movie is when taken on its own merits.

Plot: Sarah Bowman (American Beauty's Mena Suvari) fled her provincial little town by joining the army-- or so she thought. She gets posted right back there when the town is quarantined. Nobody's quite sure why the town's been quarantined, but when Sarah's mother comes down with the same thing everyone else has, Sarah and somewhat lovestruck private Bud Crain (Stark Sands, recently of Flags of Our Fathers) rush her to the hospital along with Sarah's intractable younger brother Trevor (An American Crime's Michael Welch) and his girlfriend Nina (AnnaLynne McCord, now in the new 90210 TV series). While there, they bump into a few other army types, notably her commanding officer (Rhames) and an annoying doctor type, Logan (The Dark Knight's Matt Rippy). Once most of the cast is in place, well, you know what's going to happen. Zombies! Blood! Gore! Ving Rhames chewing scenery!

I think that had they attempted a straight remake-- with Romero's last echoes of the Cold War intact-- the movie probably would have been as much of a failure as, well, most of the horror remakes that have come down the pike in the past five years or so. But Miner (Lake Placid) and screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick (Final Destination) reused the title and reimagined the rest, and came up with something that's actually fun, fast-paced, and moderately interesting. Avoid the temptation to compare it to the original (which is extremely interesting, though neither fun nor fast-paced, both by design) and you'll likely enjoy this a great deal more. ***",1223510400,2,2173,4.9316939890710385
3296537,1,B00116GEHU,"I had the reviews read, and heeded them.  But my desire to see something in the realm of zombie was so overwhelming that, despite the warnings, I went ahead and watched it.  I was prepared for a lesser remake from the Zach Snyder Dawn of the Dead, what I was not prepared for was the kind of schlock that this movie threw down my helpless gullet as I prayed for the sake of decency that it would get better as I watched it.  Yes, I could turn it off, but it was SO bad that I had to watch it for fifteen more minutes in hopes that the next 15 would make up for it and my life would not have truly been wasted.  And....it didn't....

Here's what sucked about this movie (note: this is full of spoilers designed to keep you from making the same mistake I did by watching it):  1. The virus is NOT the same as the original.  It's airborne now giving symptoms of a cold causing everyone who had been infected with cold symptoms to stop inexplicably in the middle of what they are doing and spontaneously turn into a zombie for NO reason at all, at the same time.  Poorly contrived, executed, and stupid to boot; 2. The zombies are SUPERNATURAL in nature NOT simply altered humans.  These zombies can climb walls and run along the ceiling like lame Alien knock offs.  The original idea was fine, but these writers forced an unnecessary ""improvement"" and again, executed it poorly and made it look stupid; 3. All of the characters have been redone through a filter of stupidity (including Ving Rhames, you bastards!), all being lead by Nick Cannon.  Truth told, I've never seen his stuff before.  After this, I don't think I can.  Romero fans know that there has always been a surviving and oft times leading black guy who saves the day either fully or in part, and it has been awesome every time.  Cannon's character was insulting, and Romero should sue for taking his idea and turning it into a stupid MTV gen stereotype unfit for social consumption.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.

I understand that the repeated use of a blanket statement is not the kind of review most would hope for, but ""stupid"" PERFECTLY describes this experience in it's most exact form.  Aside from the glaring (and mostly unforgiveable) issues above, the rest is just BORING.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie, and if you are curious regardless of this or any other warning you may receive, I understand.  BUT you'd be better off watching ANY one of the zombie flicks from the '80s that spawned from Romero's work as they are all far superior to this, and cheaper in the long run anyway.",1223510400,2,2564,4.498920086393088

I like the combination of both fast and smart that the zombies were in this film.

3296541,4,B00116GEHU,"The first thing I do when I find out that a new movie is coming to DVD, is to pour over as many online review that I can find, and with this film, pretty much every review paned the heck out of it, so much so, that I swore it off of my, ""DVD's To Get"" list.

But then a coincidental thing happened to me; I was at a Roger's Cable store paying a bill, when what should I see on the in-store monitors, but a rather nice trailer for this very movie (and let me tell you, the trailer looked like a lot of good undead fun).

So on the strength of the trailer, I decided to give the film a chance (as there have been other films that have gotten terrible reviews in the past, that I have then watched and found to be great, so I figured that the same could hold true for this flick)

And guess what, this film was as good as it's trailer implied it would be (watch the trailer online, and if you find the trailer interesting then you'll more then likely like the film).

First off the acting was pretty good for a straight to DVD film, as where the effects, and contrary to other reviews, the story does loosely follow the original in that it deals with the military and scientists point of view during this outbreak, and they do eventually end up in an underground type facility, and they even have the, ""Bud"" character, albeit used in a slightly different manner, but for this version, it works.

Now I personally prefer the slow plodding undead over the uberzombies of the, Dawn of the Dead, remake, but seeing as there is a different type of thing turning the populous into the undead, it works for this film.

My only real contention with this DVD isn't the movie, but the inaccurate DVD cover, because no one ever throws up in the film, not the undead or the living, so the image is very misleading and just plain wrong.

Another thing that I really liked about this film, is that even though the main characters have their faults, they're still likable enough that you're rooting for them to make it, because it seems to have become a trend in movies now a days, to make the main characters so darn annoying that you're actually hoping to see them die, or just don't care when they do.

One reviewer actually took one silly effect for the bases as to why they didn't like the film, and that scene was  during an undead  attack in a hospital where one undead, runs up the side of a wall, crawls for a moment on the ceiling, then drops to the floor to join in on the feeding frenzy, and the reviewer mentioned that the undead must have acquired Spier-Man like qualities, when in fact what you have here is more along the lines of a sight gag, done to promote the fact that these things are fast, so fast in mater of fact, that during a feeding frenzy they'll do anything to get at food, even if it means running up a wall to get around the other undead vying for the same food stuffs (and it only happens once, and for a split second as part of a master shot, and isn't given any special camera time other then that, so I don't see why that one thing could be considered grievous enough to write off an entire film over).

So if you're looking for a little undead fun, then this is defiantly worth a rental or a purchase.",1221177600,,3220,4.228013029315961

3296544,3,B00116GEHU,"After the surprising quality of the 2004 Dawn Of The Dead remake, it was just inevitable that some other filmmaker would come to put their own vision on another of George Romero's zombieworks. This time his third chapter would get the treatment in 2008's Day Of The Dead. But unlike '04's Dawn sticking close to the original vision, Day takes the phrase ""reimagining"" to a whole new level.

Honestly, aside from a few of the original surnames used, this movie is nothing like the original 1985 Day Of The Dead, From it's location, to it's plot, to the Zombies themselves, this film could have been called anything. In alot of ways it reminded me of that other abomination 2005's Day Of The Dead 2:Contagium, with it's connection to the original in name only. But just for a second let's look past the title, and see if there's a good movie in there somewhere, shall we?

DOTD08 takes a new and fresh look at the world of Zombies, but in a more quickened pace. Apparently in this day and age, we don't have time to wait for zombies to dig out of their graves. Heck, we don't even have time for people to die! That's because in DOTD08, the zombies aren't dead. Huh? Nope, it's another one of those ""Contagium In The Air Virus"" stories we've seen before. Where? Maybe Nightmare City? Demons 1 and 2? 28 Days/Weeks Later? YES, that last one! In fact, this film's premise will remind you of those last films. No longer do we have to wait to get bitten or plain old die, it could happen to anyone in this town at anytime. Talk about a case of ADD filmmaking!

The cast has a few familiar faces that do an adequate job here, including cutie-pie Mena Suvari, stereotypical Nick Cannon, and a phoning-it-in Ving Rhames (possibly playing his brother that he established/mentioned in the previous remake...maybe). But looking at the Zombies themselves, they do give a fresh outlook on the genre that gives mixed results. First, they rot instantly. From the moment you freeze-up from the virus to the time you awaken hungry for flesh, you look weeks dead in an instant. Also like 28D/WL you gain superhuman strength causing great ability to jump high and even climb ceilings....

(I wanna interupt myself right here: Alot of reviewers of this film have mentioned ad nauseum about some ""Zombie Spidermen"" in the film. I want to debunk that right now. There is one scene, lasting 3 seconds, where one zombie, ONE, jumps up, breaks his arms and legs through the ceiling, hangs on to the underneath rafter beams, grabs hold of the next group, moves one space like a jungle gym, and then falls on his victim. THAT'S IT! This comment has bothered me since I've seen the movie because I envisioned an army of wall-crawling nightcrawlers due to these comments. It's just not so.)

....and boy are they flammable! Overall, the effects are pretty darn decent and do keep your eyes busy. But if you're looking for any social commentary that Romero or even DOTD04 provided, forget it. This is just Zombie carnage, and honestly not much of that to begin with. Director Steve Miner, who gave us some great Friday The 13th and Halloween sequels, had provided us with a decent Zombie movie, but like Contagium before it, is cursed to panning by using that established name in vain. But if you can Fast Forward through the title sequence never to see the name, you might enjoy this film better. Comes with some decent extras and a commentary that gives the film just too much credit. Recommended to any fan of the 28 series who thinks a frantic, running zombie is better than a lumbering one (have you guys ever heard of rigormortis?), this will help kill an hour and a half while increasing your desire to see the true 1985 film that inspired it.

P.S.:Do you think that Zombie on the front cover throwing-up his latest victim looks pretty cool? Then you better stare at that box a little longer, it's NOWHERE to be found in the actual movie.

The film introduces a ridiculous new element: the people are sick and in a matter of two seconds, they become rotten zombies. Snap! Just like that. And some of them are so ferocious they even climb through ceilings. And something else: zombies are flammable! LOL These are such dumb ideas.

The makeup is not bad, but we've seen a lot better. I just saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Living-Dead-4-Necropolis/dp/B000EHQ7YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis</a>&nbsp;the other day and found its makeup work superior at some moments.

This is another American horror film shot in eastern Europe and we can clearly see how such option (no matter how much money it saves) is limited when it comes to locations. Too limited in my opinion. This is a trend in today's horror films. But it is true: you try to make Romania or Bulgaria to look like the United States... and you are restricted to the woods, one street and some shabby old military buildings.

And something else: after a nice first half where the small Colorado city where the action takes place gets devoured, the last quarter of the film is spent inside a military secret compound (a cheap set built in a soundstage). In other words, instead of delivering a great ending, the film decides to save money in its last quarter.

All these elements probably brought the film down from receiving a wide release. It looks too cheap even with all the good points I already explained. It's simply an underachiever.

And how did they come up with that idea for the DVD cover? A zombie throwing up? What does that have to do with anything?

Zombie spider man, zombie spider man, does whatever a zombie/spider does. Eats your limbs, climbs on walls, shoots other zombies in the head. Look out; here comes the zombie spider man.

I could go on forever my friends, but you'd get pretty mad if I just had these stupid spider man references. But I can't help myself, when I see a zombie defy gravity and walk like a spider on the side of a wall I have to laugh and call it a zombiefied spider man. I guess Peter Parker was on vacation in Colorado when the zombie flue hit and he was caught in the crossfire. But then how can I explain the fact that everyone is a super zombie spider man? Seriously though, how does being transformed into an undead zombie give you super powers? Here's a list of zombie super powers.
1) They can climb on walls, like Spider Man. Duh. Think the I Am Legend zombie things (which, BTW, I though were pretty lame when compared to the ones in the book) but with bad makeup.
2) They can catapult themselves without any effort. I had a good laugh when one of the zombies just flew out of his seat without any effort, as if there was a giant spring he was sitting on that just tossed him across the room.
3) Super jumping abilities. Just like you guessed it, spider man. Not only can they scale walls and catapult themselves across the room, but they are pretty mean jumpers too. One second there across the room the next their flying through the air.
4) The ability to walk/stumble/lurch/run/jump/whatever in slow jerking motions impossible for any living person to achieve.

The only thing missing is the web shooter and Mary Jane running down the street in a wedding dress.

Oh, and just to let you know, I didn't really lose fifty pounds, so all you people who are overweight, don't think a Day of the Dead diet is going to help you lose the weight. I laughed because the movie was so over the top BAD that I could not believe my eyes (hence the extra star, I laughed my butt off, its almost so bad its good, almost but not quite), I cried because they made a mockery of my favorite Romero zombie movie Day of the Dead, and I almost lost weight, although maybe not fifty pounds, because I almost blew my head off when the new Bub started eyeing the new Sara's, uhh, package. No Bub, that's a bad zombie, bad zombie, phooey, phooey.

This isn't a remake; besides the name of the film the original and this thing have absolutely nothing in common. The original took place almost exclusively in an underground missile silo where scientists and soldiers held an uneasy truce; this new one has an underground silo, but they don't enter it until near the end and here the scientists are the bad guys and the soldiers the good guys. In the original Captain Rhodes was a young, ruthless, power hungry white guy with a really short temper, here he's an old, disciplined, black guy who's also a well oiled fighting machine. The original Bub, awesome. The new Bub, de de de. The old Dr. Logan, AKA Frankenstein, a charming, charismatic, crazy guy who manages to talk people silly; the new Dr. Logan, the biggest A hole in the world.

And not its time for Jonathan's ""word of the day.""

Today's word is, Zombie Pets. Yes I know it sounds a little unconventional to keep a pet zombie around the house, especially one who could potently climb on your walls and stain your ceiling with bloody hand prints (those things are almost impossible to get off) but the benefits of having such a wonderful pet are also very great. Just think of all the things one of these undead creatures can do for you; check the mail, water the plants, mow the lawn, eat your boss, take over the world, and much, much more.
Zombie pets are easy to train and there is no need to feed or clean up after them. They require no nourishment as they are already dead, and because they do not require food they cannot defecate in your lawn or living room. Depending on their previous life they can be taught a host of tasks from running around with guns shooting at the air, pushing shopping carts, or babysitting your children.

Be sure to have your zombie spaded and neutered upon obtaining it, especially if they are of the male persuasion. Don't forget that they still retain a little bit of their former selves, the last thing you want is a baby zombie on your hands.

Always make sure your zombie knows who's in charge. Whenever it starts to growl at company or your children, establish your dominance over it with a quite hit to the nose. If that doesn't work hit it on the back of the head and yell phooey. Remember, zombies are no more dangerous then large dogs if handled correctly, left unattended and unloved though and they could become a danger to you and those around you. Always discipline bad behavior and reward good behavior with a pat on the head.

Keep your zombie on a leash whenever taking it on a walk, even if it has no history of violence. I know it may seem tempting to let it run free in the park but always remember that it is a potently deadly animal. Most states have severe penalties for owners of zombies whose pets attack another human or pet. Keep yourself safe and always maintain direct control over your pet.

And that concludes my word of the day. For those who have not seen this film yet I am sorry but the joke won't be as funny, for those who have I hope you liked it.

As a C-quality movie this new version of Day of the Dead may be just ""passable"".  But for fans of cinema or just zombie movies in general, this isn't going to cut it.

Day of the Dead starts out dull with scenarios we're all too familiar with, plods along slowly with one dimensional characters we could care less about, and manages to pick up mild speed when zombies start to appear.

*How can some zombies leap around like they're straight out of Gymkata?
*What is with that funky DVD cover art picture?

On the plus side, the zombies look good and are frightening at times.  There's one stop-pause-rewind death scene worth enjoying, and some of the direction and camera techniques work and give the movie an occasional jolt.

But, it's all far too little to recommend...to even people I don't like (much less the wonderful readers here at Amazon).  So do yourself a favor and rent a good zombie movie like the superior recent remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD or read a great zombie novel like J.L.

3296607,5,B00116GEHU,"Okay, first of all, it was never said that this movie was a re-make. It was only ""based"" on the George A. Romero classic. So naturally, it's not going to be exactly like the original. Besides, from what I understand the original received crappy reviews anyway. Now don't get me wrong, I love George A. Romero, but just because you love Romero, that doesn't mean you have to shun all other zombie flicks. C'mon...think out of the box people!!!
This movie had non-stop action that left you on the edge of your seat all throughout the movie and the gore was fantastic!! People have also commented that the acting was bad. I couldn't disagree more. I know bad acting when I see it and I'm sorry, the characters in this film were more than believable.
So, if ou love action and gore that makes your stomach turn, this movie is for you!!! Now if you're a boring individual that simply likes to watch the same types of movies over and over and over again, go right ahead, pass this up......*yawn*",1214611200,3,989,4.5
3296608,4,B00116GEHU,"If you're looking for an entertaining horror film, this is it.  I do not understand the negative reviews this film is getting, especially as the writers are acting like this film personally attacked them.  They go on and on about how ridiculous the film is, which is complete nonsense -- it's a bloody living dead zombie movie, and that means it's about gore and horror, not about realism and sensible plots.  I also cannot understand why the film didn't get a theatrical release, because I would have loved to see this film in a theater full of screaming people.  I think this is much preferable to the ""remake"" of Dawn of the Dead from 2004, a film I also enjoyed, but I liked this one better.

Narrative-wise this is a sort of cross between Romero's Crazies story (which I believe is ALSO being ""remade"") with the more traditional Night of the Living Dead gut-munching.  In other words, it's not the Dead coming back, it's about infected people.  The film is gloriously gory, and it's paced like a bullet!  If this isn't a good horror movie, then what is it people want?

Among the Amazon reviews I've scanned, I see people calling this a ""travesty"" of the Romero original.  But if you look at the general reviews of Romero's film from 1985, when it was released, you'll see the SAME crap as you get here -- people complaining about bad dialog and horrible acting.  So little has changed -- horror films get no respect at all, not even by the fans themselves.

I think the acting is fine, because how else would you act in situations like you get here?  How many different ways do you scream and run?  The plot is quite acceptable, and the performances are just fine.  I'm a big fan of Mena Suvari, and she fits her role perfectly, and everyone complements each other.  The military is called in to quarantine a small Colorado town, and except for the officers, who would be a bit older and more ""professional,"" it's quite realistic than the soldiers would be younger and not so experienced.  Which is a fine setup to when everything goes wrong, as it does.

I do admit that Romero is the master, and he brings a larger world-view to his work -- by which I mean social comment.  Neither this nor the Dawn remake can even begin to do that.  But as entertainments, this works perfectly.  It won't change your life, but it will give you a nice 90 minute tingle or two.",1213920000,,2368,4.498829039812646
3296609,2,B00116GEHU,"He looks like a zombie, he acts like a bug, we should give him one big hug. Look out yall, here comes the zombie spider man.

Zombie spider man, zombie spider man, does whatever a zombie/spider does. Eats your limbs, climbs on walls, shoots other zombies in the head. Look out; here comes the zombie spider man.

I could go on forever my friends, but you'd get pretty mad if I just had these stupid spider man references. But I can't help myself, when I see a zombie defy gravity and walk like a spider on the side of a wall I have to laugh and call it a zombiefied spider man. I guess Peter Parker was on vacation in Colorado when the zombie flue hit and he was caught in the crossfire. But then how can I explain the fact that everyone is a super zombie spider man? Seriously though, how does being transformed into an undead zombie give you super powers? Here's a list of zombie super powers.
1) They can climb on walls, like Spider Man. Duh. Think the I Am Legend zombie things (which, BTW, I though were pretty lame when compared to the ones in the book) but with bad makeup.
2) They can catapult themselves without any effort. I had a good laugh when one of the zombies just flew out of his seat without any effort, as if there was a giant spring he was sitting on that just tossed him across the room.
3) Super jumping abilities. Just like you guessed it, spider man. Not only can they scale walls and catapult themselves across the room, but they are pretty mean jumpers too. One second there across the room the next their flying through the air.
4) The ability to walk/stumble/lurch/run/jump/whatever in slow jerking motions impossible for any living person to achieve.

The only thing missing is the web shooter and Mary Jane running down the street in a wedding dress.

Oh, and just to let you know, I didn't really lose fifty pounds, so all you people who are overweight, don't think a Day of the Dead diet is going to help you lose the weight. I laughed because the movie was so over the top BAD that I could not believe my eyes (hence the extra star, I laughed my [...] off, its almost so bad its good, almost but not quite), I cried because they made a mockery of my favorite Romero zombie movie Day of the Dead, and I almost lost weight, although maybe not fifty pounds, because I almost blew my head off when the new Bub started eyeing the new Sara's, uhh, package. No Bub, that's a bad zombie, bad zombie, phooey, phooey.

This isn't a remake; besides the name of the film the original and this thing have absolutely nothing in common. The original took place almost exclusively in an underground missile silo where scientists and soldiers held an uneasy truce; this new one has an underground silo, but they don't enter it until near the end and here the scientists are the bad guys and the soldiers the good guys. In the original Captain Rhodes was a young, ruthless, power hungry white guy with a really short temper, here he's an old, disciplined, black guy who's also a well oiled fighting machine. The original Bub, awesome. The new Bub, de de de. The old Dr. Logan, AKA Frankenstein, a charming, charismatic, crazy guy who manages to talk people silly; the new Dr. Logan, the biggest A hole in the world.

And not its time for Jonathan's ""word of the day.""

Today's word is, Zombie Pets. Yes I know it sounds a little unconventional to keep a pet zombie around the house, especially one who could potently climb on your walls and stain your ceiling with bloody hand prints (those things are almost impossible to get off) but the benefits of having such a wonderful pet are also very great. Just think of all the things one of these undead creatures can do for you; check the mail, water the plants, mow the lawn, eat your boss, take over the world, and much, much more.

Zombie pets are easy to train and there is no need to feed or clean up after them. They require no nourishment as they are already dead, and because they do not require food they cannot defecate in your lawn or living room. Depending on their previous life they can be taught a host of tasks from running around with guns shooting at the air, pushing shopping carts, or babysitting your children.

Be sure to have your zombie spayed and neutered upon obtaining it, especially if they are of the male persuasion. Don't forget that they still retain a little bit of their former selves, the last thing you want is a baby zombie on your hands.

Always make sure your zombie knows who's in charge. Whenever it starts to growl at company or your children, establish your dominance over it with a quite hit to the nose. If that doesn't work hit it on the back of the head and yell phooey. Remember, zombies are no more dangerous then large dogs if handled correctly, left unattended and unloved though and they could become a danger to you and those around you. Always discipline bad behavior and reward good behavior with a pat on the head.

Keep your zombie on a leash whenever taking it on a walk, even if it has no history of violence. I know it may seem tempting to let it run free in the park but always remember that it is a potently deadly animal. Most states have sever penalties for owners of zombies whose pets attack another human or pet. Keep yourself safe and always maintain direct control over your pet.

And that concludes my word of the day. For those who have not seen this film yet I am sorry but the joke won't be as funny, for those who have I hope you liked it.

3296645,3,B00116GEHU,"With Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari, Michael Welch, Pat Kilbane and Nick Cannon starring in a zombie movie is worth watching. People really can't expect to have high expectations when it comes to zombie movies now theses days so with that in mind reviewers should not be so hard on rating them. Ok so first off I do think that they went about this all wrong promoting the movie and if they have poor sales blame it on the company who gave the ok on the DVD cover. It would've got more attention just having a picture of all the stars holding weapons with a zombies all in the background instead of one cover having a zombie throwing up and on the other DVD cover a few scary faces floating around on the cover.
No zombies threw up on anyone in the movie. The virus spreaded like a cold and this could've actually played as a part of dawn of the dead as if this was taking place elsewhere not too far away from the other locations that were in the dawn of the dead. Ok, let's just say Ving Rhames had a twin brother in the military. Because in Dawn of the Dead as an officer of the law who he played he did mention that he had a brother who was in the military who he wanted to go and reach to see if he was ok. Nick cannon at first I thought acting was overdone but he sort of blended in with all the mix once the movie really got the ball rolling. And there were some corny parts that I would've just left out for the bonus features on the DVD. The acting and special effects were done pretty good in my eyes. Also if folks haven't realized by now ZOMBIES don't move slow anymore in movies today (thanks to the remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead and 28 weeks later). It adds more pressure of suspense trying to get away from them. I've seen tons of pointless rated ""B"" zombie movies with sorry special effects. The fact that we can still get some decent ones out here with good actors in it needs to be given a little more credit if we want them to get any better but at the same time if companies are going to put that much money into getting these actors then they need to find better ways of promoting them, better way advertising so it will sell. Because I've seen better ""B"" rated movies with way better artwork on them than what a title like DAY OF THE DEAD should have. I'd fire the person who designed both of the DVD covers. No creativity at all. If I didn't happen to see the names of the stars who were playing in this movie I'd might have overlooked it very easliy with the chessy DVD cover they are using to sell it.",1211241600,,2525,4.134146341463414
3296646,1,B00116GEHU,"Well, the good news for fans of Romero's Day of the Dead is that this horrible piece of filmmaking is only about %5 remake. Thankfully, the filmmakers injected a whole lot that has absolutlely nothing to do with Romero's 1985 classic. Unfortunately most of what they came up with, to borrow the imagery on the dvd cover, blows chunks.
  Apart from some minor similarities (character names, a brief time spent in a military bunker, soldiers) the '08 Day of the Dead plays more like a lame rip-off of 28 Days Later. The 'zombies' here are people infected by a (yawn) ""secret government warfare project which leaks out into a small town"". One minute, the townsfolk have the symptoms of a common cold with added nosebleed, the next they are transformed instantly into pizza-faced super-ghouls (with make-ups reminiscent of the original Evil Dead) who can leap through the air like characters in a Hong-Kong fantasy film and who can climb upside down on ceilings like Spiderman. And of course, like all good modern 'zombies', these are especially fast runners.
  One theme of Romero's that the filmmakers did include was that of the dead remembering parts of their former selves and former lives. But here, it goes no further than 'Bud' being aware that he was a vegetarian whilst alive, and therefore having no taste for the human flesh that his kind crave. Oh, and he also recalls that he has a crush on Mena Suvari's character, Sarah, and this attraction carries over, along with his vegetarianism, into his afterlife. Unfortunately the film wasn't set up as a comedy, and nothing else in it is funny.
  So, fans of Romero's Day of the Dead rest easy. Day of the Dead 2008 is really no remake at all. Hopefully anybbody who watches this and hasn't seen Day of the Dead 1985 will not be discouraged from seeking out a real zombie film, from a man who knows the genre.",1211155200,2,1864,4.7024539877300615

3296653,1,B00116GEHU,"For the love of zombies...WHY?!?!!?

1) ACTING: I was really surprised by the quality of acting in this movie. I wasn't expecting Sir Lawrence Oliver doing 'Hamlet,' but I really thought it would have been better than it was. I thought that some of the best work in this movie came from the lesser known actors. Maybe they thought they had to prove themselves next to the established actors in this movie. Nick Cannon comes off as a poor man's Will Smith, and Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames seem to have just stopped by for the paycheck. I thought the actor that played ""Bud"" was pretty good, though.

2) PRODUCTION: I only need to say this: C.G.I. I know that nowadays computer generated effects are easy to do and more more inexpensive than actual physical special effects, but I would think somewhere in the production line, someone would point out that everything can't (or shouldn't) be generated by a computer.
The filming of this movie was acceptable as was the soundtrack. I was greatly disappointed that a lot of simple special effects, such as blood splattering, was done by C.G.I. I'm assuming that the majority of the money spent on this opus was to pay the salaries of Suvari, Rhames and Cannon. I would've sent in ten bucks so the make up artist could've ran to the corner 7-11 and bought some Karo syruo and red food dye. And the scene on the cover? Doesn't even happen in this movie.

3) ZOMBIES: HUH?!? 1968--Zombies walking? It defies logic! 2004--Zombies running?? That's just not possible!! 2008--Zombies sticking to the walls like Spider-man??? Ummmm....okay...
The zombie make up is okay, but nothing incredible. It is a step up from the ""pale faced raccoon eyes"" that we're so accustomed to seeing in low / no budget zombie flicks.

4) THE CAUSE: Government created flu-like virus.

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL: I'm kinda speechless. The fact that this cinematic gem is a ""remake"" of Romero's 1985 flick may have been it's biggest flaw. I really feel that if this movie was called something else, we, the zombie loving community that we are, would've ben more accepting of it. It would've gone down as just another cheesy, mediocre zombie flick. I guess there really isn't a thing called ""bad publicity."" How many debates and arguements have and will occur as this is compared to Romero's original?
And sadly, Steve Miner is an established known horror director. Here, it seems he showed up, again, just for the paycheck. Ving Rhames, in my opinion, was in this to make potential viewers think that this was a continuation of the much better 2004 remake of 'Dawn of the Dead,' even though his character died in that one.
Now, here's the clinker. If this was, as I mentioned, a cheesy, mediocre zombie flick with a different name, lesser known actors and an unknown / unproven director, I think I would've enjoyed it more. I could've been more forgiving. The fact that it was to be a remake, with an established director and proven actors, means that it should've been so much more. Sadly, I was glad when this 'Day' was over.

If you think about it the Dawn of the Dead re-make was more of a retelling wasn't it, and that was a really great film. Not as good as the original in alot of was but was pretty darn good.

All that being said, if your a ""zombie"" flick fan as I am, you really should at least watch this with an open mind. With so many ""zombie"" films not living up to the expectation of the trailer and reviews, which I try not to listen to anyway, this film really isn't that bad. Everyone has different ideas some are lame ( Vampires vs Zombies anyone?) and some work well Dawn of the Dead (re-telling).

This is one film that should stand alone. Keep Romero's original out of mind. I see this film as a must have for hardcore ""zombie"" flick fans!

The ""zombies"" look good, and I do think it works well. That's just my opinion, watch for yourself.",1208995200,2,1178,4.176211453744493
3296691,2,B00116GEHU,"What a waste. I was really hoping Steve Miner could pull this off. This is a huge insult to George Romero. Let's just say when a movie is direct-to-video, it's ususally for a reason. Snyder's 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was obviously an anomaly and the standard of detestable classic horror remakes is alive and well with the 2008 ""Day of the Dead"".

The zombies are truly laughable: they bounce around like the monkey-bats from ""The Wizard of Oz"", climb walls and ceilings like your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and get instant Freddy Krueger pizza face during the morphing process.

I'd give it 1 star, but I have seen worse; much worse. Spider-Zombies can't hold a candle to the Raccoon-Eye Zombies of the repugnant spectacle that was Ulli Lomell's ""Zombie Nation"".

Do yourself a favor, skip this and buy any of the official Romero flicks or the Snyder remake of ""Dawn"". Already own 'em? Upgrade and buy 'em in blu-ray. That would be money well spent.",1208908800,,966,4.772455089820359

The only similarities seem to be the main characters are National Guardsmen and there's a ""friendly"" semi-intelligent zombie named Bud.  However, the original Day was the worst film Romero ever did, and not significantly better than this.

Yeah, zombification is spread via an airborne bioweapon that escaped from a secret government lab, which is a neat twist.  The zombies, however, are something else.  Fast zombies?  How about superfast gymnastic zombies who can leap over obstacles and even crawl across the ceiling -- NO, we shant be having zombified supervillans, it shall not stand.  Then, the instantaneous zombification process, to which I must also say NO.  Here's what I'm seeing -- *cough* ""Uh, I feel kinda bad, dang flu."" Then POW -- INSTANT SUPER ZOMBIE!!!  Really, sicko is laying in bed all coughin' and barely able to move, but within seconds they are not only flying across the room at warp speed to chow down, but they've somehow been completely transfigured with full body ulcerations and such.  Not even a 5 minute transformation process.  And what is with the ""vomit"" picture on the cover?  I must've somehow missed the zombie puke scene -- was there one?

The other thing that got to me was the handguns that would rapidfire 200+ rounds out of a single magazine (with ""vwip vwip"" noises that sounded as if they'd been dubbed from a videogame . . . don't y'all know guns go ""BANG""?), then a character saying, ""We'll need to get some more ammo soon!"" . . . but they never reload or run dry.  Zombie Bud doesn't attack his companions ""because he was a vegetarian"" -- yet other zombies will think nothing of attacking family members?  Then there was the token black man who kept making comments about his perceived oppression throughout . . . once or even twice might've worked, but it got old fast.  And the girl going, ""Hey, let's just just the nozzles off these flammable gas cannisters and ignite then to make a big flamethrower thingee!"" . . . but wouldn't it it far more likely just to explode?  And why are there suddenly a hundred zombies hiding out at the secret base far from town?  Need I also mention the National Guardsmen zombies firing M-16s?  As for the Alternate Ending -- don't even bother wasting your time with it.

It was watchable . . . but turned out to be a complete waste of time.  Better films include: Dawn of the Dead (original 78 version), Night of the Living Dead (1990 remake), and Hide & Creep.",1208736000,2,2524,4.665158371040724

But I think some people need to get over their fan boy ways and accept other movies for what they are. After reading many terrible reviews on amazon about this movie.. I was almost afraid to buy it.. But you know what, it really wasn't that bad. The plot could have been a little stronger .. And I think that could have been done by not jumping into the action so fast and letting the story unfold a little more. I think the black guy jokes were a little over done by the african american character.. The acting wasn't superb in parts.. But it wasn't all that bad either.. And at times the cast done pretty well. Someone here said the FX were really low budget.. What movie were they watching? The FX were pretty darn good.. Nice zombie make up. I think what they went for here was a more action packed zombie movie.. and wanted to show the actual zombie take over.. rather than the isolated survivor kind of story. The movie did have alot of zombie action in it.. And some will enjoy it just for that.. My 64 year old mother actually liked this movie.. and she's a hard one to please on horror these days.. So all things being said.. it wasn't that bad. It was one of those movies that after you watch it.. it kind of sinks in and grows on you.. And you actually realize that you kind of liked it.. So if your a zombie fan, give it a go.. It's not as bad as all these nay sayers would have you believe.. it's really rather enjoyable. But if your a die hard fan boy, or girl for that matter..

The Nike silo/bunker looked like a cheap set that the Resident Evil folks decided wasn't good enough for their work.  The super speed was bad but the climbing on the ceiling bit, was HORRIBLE.  I can take a lot of cheesy stuff, but that was not only bad, but unrealistic--if they can climb ceilings, why couldn't get into the ducts the main characters were climbing through? How would a nerve agent meant to paralyze enemy soldiers for 72 hours mutate you into something that can jump 10 feet in the air and climb on ceilings?  a little too farfetched...

I also don't mind borrowing from other movies, but some of the tricks that were taken from Snyder's version of Dawn of the Dead were poorly used and didn't make a lot of sense.  The movie becomes better if you don't even associate it remotely with the original Day and just accept it's a ""B"" flick.

I also liked the acting as well as the comedy involved with the movie. I loved it when the one character told the severed head to ""shut up [...]!"" and kicked it like a football. I also liked the fact that they tried to do something different with this movie and gave some of the zombies superhuman characteristics like wall climbing.

When it comes to zombie movies, I'm pretty outspoken on whether they are good or not and, this one, measures right up there with ""28 Days Later"" yet on its' own. Although the film doesn't have any connection to Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"", the film itself was based on George Romero's original 1985 script & film of the same name.

The film is directed by Steve Miner(best known for ""Halloween H20""). It was written by Jeffrey Reddick(known for his ""Final Destination"" screenplays) and stars Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari, and Nick Cannon.

It tells the story of a government contained city infected by zombies.  The remaining survivors try to make their way to an underground tunnel. That's, basically, where the fun begins. Like ""Dawn of the Dead"" before it, ""Day of the Dead"" tries to take a fresh spin on the zombie genre. For the most part, it succeeds admirably with great acting by Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari, and Nick Cannon.

While it may not break new ground(like 28 Days Later) as much as it should for a zombie movie, it is still a great movie. One I highly recommend in the onslaught of remakes these days(and I do mean onslaught).",1208217600,3,1364,4.647302904564316
3296718,2,B00116GEHU,"What a fantastic opportunity they had with this film.  With a few revisions, Romero's original script could have made a much better film than this one is.  While it's good that there's more than one woman in this movie, Sarah should have remained a scientist, and there is no need for the Trevor character to be her brother.  They took away the brilliant madness of Dr. Logan, who is not a hospital clinician, but one of the creators of the virus.  Salazar is annoying, and the romantic tension between he and Sarah is totally gone, replaced by a thoroughly inappropriate pseudo-relationship with Bud.  And the whole idea of the super-zombie has become absolutely overdone.  Real zombie terror is generated by a slow zombie, who kills you through your own stupidity.

One more thing:  What is it with these movies with killing off the medics?  Can't any Doctors or nurses (Sarah Polley's character doesn't seem to have much knowledge of medicine or biology) survive a zombie movie?",1208131200,,981,4.86144578313253

Steve Miner took a lot from his slasher movie roots, especially in the first forest run of fear from the killer. Many points in the movie, including bodies falling from hiding places and standard slasher suprises pepper the movie.

But I do put a premium on zombie feasts and zombie kills, and this movie is chock full of them. The outbreak takes place pretty early in the movie, and we are treated to an all out zombie assault on the small Colorado town like I don't think I've seen in movies before. It's a zombie free-for-all that the protagonists have to fight their way through, dropping zombies left and right. I really liked this segement of the movie, and in those moments, redeemed the bad reputation it had garnered before I watched it.

As a disciple of Romero, I naturally am not happy with more people cashing in on his works. But if this movie makes people want to explore the original, then bully for ""Day..."" 2008.

My other gripe was that the zombies were like ninjas in some parts. Fast moving. OK. Ninja attacks from walls and ceilings. Nnnnnnnnnnnnno!

Nope, not happening here. This movie was actually quite terrible, and when viewed with pleasant expectations, it makes the entire experience even more excruciating to see. The film opens up with a quarantine of a small Colorado town being enforced by a group of National Guardsmen, including Ving Rhames (shame on him for adding his name to this cast of poor actors staving off starvation in real life) over a chemical agent's release into the air that ""suddenly"" turns people into zombies. Oh, the zombies are rather poorly made up as well. The movie then becomes a somewhat comical romp that you are sorely tempted to simply turn off. I left it on in the hopes that it would get better, but now only know that I'm a glutton for punishment.
This movie was a great opportunity wasted for the cast and direction was deplorable, but the writing was even worse. I know that George Romero is releasing Diary of the Dead next month.

If the title weren't ""Day of the Dead"", it would be confused with countless other low-watt, forgettable zombie fare.  But measuring a film by previously set standards works both ways.  Yes, if it weren't titled ""Day of the Dead"" we might not care much about this film (that cheap, stupid cover art sure doesn't make you wanna grab it off the shelf either), but then again, we also would judge it on its own merit, not that of Romero's original. And, yes, admittedly, its merits are few, but as these cheapie zombie hodgepodges go, this one is fitfully amusing and mostly entertaining.  Oh, it is as dumb as has been pointed out here from any kind of technical standpoint, and the film seems limited by its budget, so it overcompensates - and fails - with cutting and other camera tricks that become tedious and only draw attention to its lack of budget and ambition (unlike the 2004 ""Dawn"" re-amp), but, beyond those gripes (and perhaps the performances are not the greatest, but how many Oscar winners sign up for low budget zombie remakes?) it delivers the zombie goods:  Lots of action, no hammy, self important or referential attempts at drawing parallels between zombies and humans, or society, or less-than-subtle condemnations of the government; just lots of zombies, lots of blood, and lots of action.  It moves at a fast pace and it's all done before the 90 minute mark.  Either you like this stuff or you don't.  And by that, I mean just true, blue zombie flicks.  This isn't the message movie that ""28 Weeks Later"" tried to be, or the metaphor Romero likes to sneak up on us with (or hammer our skulls with depending on your opinion of how subtly he delivers his messages), or the attempt to revitalize zombie flicks that Zack Snyder's ""Dawn' remake was.  It's just an old fashioned, cheesy zombie flick.  On that level, it's better than most that fit said category.  I expected very little here and was pleasantly surprised, a feat that always gets me defending a movie perhaps more than it deserves, but it always feels like a feat none the less.

Don't go into Day of the Dead expecting a remake of the George Romero classic. This is a remake by name only; about the only thing the share in common are some zombies, the military and a couple of characters from the original. Most of the characters are created for this movie and the whole plot completely different. Day of the Dead 08 is only a remake by name only attempting to cash in on the success of the Dawn of the Dead remake and Romero's Dead flicks.

Day of the Dead is entertaining in how bad it was. Most of this will probably be lost on the audience since most of us won't be able to help, but compare to the two. As a remake Day of the Dead is a travesty of a film and complete insult to the original. But as a stand alone movie it's actually fun in how bad it is. I was able to put the original out of my head and take the movie for what it was; a silly zombie flick.

Day of the Dead features zombies that run, which is common these days, but they also are able to jump put windows, crawl across ceilings, climb over gates and also even use weapons. If anything Day of the Dead is more of a remake of Umberto Lenzi's Nightmare City. Those two have more in common than this does with the original Day of the Dead.

The screenplay was written by Jeffrey Reddick and it actually wasn't too bad, while most of his characters lack any depth, the script does have some fairly good moments. Again judging things on its own and not comparing to Romero's Day of the Dead, the script isn't too bad. It has elements that work and some that don't. So far I've liked Jeffrey Reddick and while this is easily his weakest script honestly it wasn't so bad. It does follow the typical Hollywood movie with the comedy aspect and some jokes were about 10-years too late, but overall it's an entertaining screenplay. Not great, but entertaining.

Director Steve Miner got his start in 1981 with Friday the 13th Part II and the following year did the 3rd installment. At the time Miner got his start there were many filmmakers just starting out in the horror genre and some others who may have been around for 10-years or more were at the peak of their career and making some of the best films of their career. So I suppose some filmmakers are bound to be left out in the cold and it seems Steve Miner was one of them. One thing that does surprise me is that isn't better known. He directed the first Friday the 13th with Jason as the killer and the first with Jason to get his Iconic mask.

Steve Miner seems to have gone back and forth between feature films and TV episodes. I do enjoy some of his work mainly his two Friday the 13th movies, but the problem with Steve Miner, which is good for Hollywood is he has no style of his own. Most of his films are just following the basic formula of another filmmaker; which also helps him land jobs when you need a quick cash in Steve Miner is the man to go to. If only he injected more of his own style in his work I think while he may not go down as one of the greatest horror filmmakers he would have had a much better career. He's shown flashes of originality, but he still does it by the books.

Steve Miner was the wrong choice for Day of the Dead; it lacks originality at every turn and he never manages to build any suspense or tension. There were a few scenes that could have worked better, but the zombies just roam around like a bunch of shuffling idiots. I assume Day of the Dead was meant to be a little campy, but it was just too much at times, thus killing any chance for a legit attempt at any suspense. The pacing of the movie is pretty good there is enough happening to keep the viewer from getting bored and while there were flaws with the script, with another director I do feel this could have been a lot better, not great, but better. But what we get is a movie that is rather bad, but entertainingly bad. Visually the movie is also weak, while it doesn't suffer from shaky cam syndrome the shot selections are kinda poor and sometimes it's tough to make out what's happening and the flashy editing doesn't really help matters.

Despite my comments I do enjoy some of Steve Miner's work in particular the two Friday the 13th movies he did. Most of my comments here were negative, but I do enjoy his work and I know he could do better. Not sure what went wrong on his part, but I do like some of his work, he just lacks originality.

The acting was fairly decent; none of the major cast members are bad. They put in good enough performances; the strongest coming from Mena Suvari as Sarah. Some say she didn't have the military persona down, but regardless I thought she did well and is the saving grace of the movie. Ving Rhames gives his usual tough guy performance and does well in a rather small role. Nick Cannon as Salazar while giving a fairly good performance is just damn annoying; his constant one-liners really aren't that funny with the exception of maybe one or two.

There is plenty of gore, but the problem is most of it is CGI, which is really annoying. Some of the CGI was fairly decent, but most were bad. Some of it looks like something you'd seen on Playstation 2. Even good CGI I'm not really into, but when it's poor it makes it even worse. Steve Miner is an old school guy I'm sure he could have been more creative and had some simple, but effective deaths instead of the poor fake looking CGI.

Day of the Dead was originally meant for a theatrical release, but ended up going direct to video, which isn't much of a surprise. Everything about Day of the Dead is DTV, but with that said I will admit to enjoying it. Again as a remake this is a travesty and an insult, but as its own movie it's sort of fun in how bad it is. Most reviews for Day of the Dead will be quite poor and honestly I understand why and I'm not even gonna attempt to defend the movie.

But with that said I did enjoy Day of the Dead as its own movie, because again outside of a couple of things this is a remake by name only. If you can view it as just another zombie movie you just might enjoy it a little bit. Sure Day of the Dead is rather bad, but it can also be fun.",1207699200,9,6345,4.17483660130719
3296807,2,B00116GEHU,"I should probably begin here by stating what many will agree is already obvious. Regardless of whatever screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick might otherwise claim, this is not a remake of George A. Romero's ""Day of the Dead."" It doesn't even further the story set in motion by Zack Snyder's surprisingly effective ""Dawn of the Dead.""

Director Steve Miner has instead opted to tack on a whole new narrative outside of what Snyder's earlier film successfully established. The spoiled meat of this new film centers around the town of Leadville, Colorado, where a mysterious flu-like virus has reduced the townsfolk to nosebleeds and nagging coughs. The military, led by the returning Ving Rhames in a role unrelated to his ""Dawn"" persona, is brought in to enact a quarantine and contain the disease before it spreads. But when flu victims quickly degenerate into flesh craving ghouls, the commandos and a handful of various other survivors soon realize the situation has far more darker and insidious origins. Predictable chaos ensues, the dead take over and we, the viewers, are left scratching our heads and wondering just what in the world this nonsense has in common with George Romero's far superior 1985 original.

I didn't necessarily hate this movie. Hate is, perhaps, too harsh of a word. I actually had a fun time with this and will more than likely be watching it again several more times down the road, just for kicks. But it could have and should have been so much more than mindless, substandard throwaway fluff. This has all the action, gore and cheap thrills the casual fan may very well admire. However, in wake of Zack Syder's impressive and far more serious ""Dawn of the Dead,"" again, I guess I was basically hoping Miner would follow that film's example and give me more bang for my buck. It is in that respect, unfortunately, that this new ""Day"" falls considerably short. Don't expect an epic. This went straight to DVD and, upon viewing the film in its entirety, one can almost certainly understand why.

It's not a complete loss, certainly nowhere near as bad as most others, but you could do better.",1207612800,2,2113,4.863888888888889

They knew how to climb stairs, use instruments, guns, avoid obstacles and a variety of other things. Plus, they were uber zombies! Zombies on steroids, or speeds or both! I like the idea of the running zombie, it makes it more challenging, but these zombies were more like Spiderman zombies. They attached themselves to the ceiling, ran faster than a human and jumped incredible distances. Shouldn't a zombie have the same limitations as a human?

The movie played a bit with subject of the original Day of the Dead. Bub, the zombie that was being trained, is mirrored in the character of Private Bud Crain(playing with the names a bit, eh?!). Bud, who was a vegetarian, shows many human, or at least animal, charactersitics. Without giving much away, he remains a vegetarian and follows the military orders. He played a good character with a lot of potential. But, they movie did not explore it quite enough...like most of the characters and storylines. The movie throws in some back stories here and there, yet never explores them. The movie sacrificed content for brevity.

It is an ok movie, better than most zombie movies. But, it fails to explore so many possibilities that it makes you frustrated. The movie could have been better and longer.

The DVD contains an alternate ending and commentary.",1207612800,3,1958,6.010752688172043
3296809,4,B00116GEHU,"I've been reading some negative reviews for this remake, but I watched it last night, and it was pretty good. It's very different from the original, so try to be open-minded about it. It's good that they use some of the original names like Sarah, Capt. Rhodes, Salazar, Dr. Logan, and Bub. (Who is renamed to Bud in this one.) Some parts remind me of 'Planet Terror' Also in this one, Capt. Rhodes didn't have too big a part and wasn't corrupt like in the original. Dr. Logan is a lot younger but very selfish, and Salazar is black and has those funny one-liners. The zombies are pretty cool. There are a lot of new characters, and some characters from the original have been taken away. Most of the movie takes place at night and they don't get to the underground missile silo until the end of the movie. This one has a lot more action than the original, but I still like the original better because of the gore effects!

In the small town of Colorado, a virus has been spread. The military has been called in to help with the quarantine, and help people throughout the town. Later, the virus spreads even more, and some people take refuge in the hospital, and the radio station. If you love zombie flicks, I highly recommend DAY OF THE DEAD!!!

I have never seen the original version, and I am sure it is just as bad. The cast is very weak with Nick cannon as one of the main stars and the special effects look ridiculous. I only got the movie because Ving Rhames was in it. He died within the first 20 minutes so that killed the rest of the movie for me. If you want to laugh or just kill some time, rent this.

There REALLY needs to be a law that prohibits anyone from: re-making George Romero zombie flicks; using Romero characters or their names in their crappy films; trying to compare their films with his, by either referring to the original film, or to Romero in their titles or credits. In fact, it ought to come with the death penalty. End of story...

I remember actually being excited about this movie when I first heard about it. The excellent ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake had just become a huge hit and so naturally they decided to remake ""Day of the Dead"" and they even got ""Dawn"" star Ving Rhames to be in it. A year passed and I never heard anything else about this movie. Now it turns out that the remake actually got made but it's so awful that it's bypassing theaters all together and going straight-to-DVD complete with the worst cover art ever. What a disappointment. Lousy effects, lousy acting (Nick Cannon got top billing, enough said!), and a lousy script that doesn't even try to match the ""Dawn"" remake in terms of offering something new and original to the genre while still paying respect to the original.

3296816,2,B00116GEHU,"This movie is a sloppy and rather pointless remake that curiously doesn't have much to do with Romero's original, which though flawed, is more entertaining than this. There are a lot of small details that will annoy the zombie/horror fan here. On their own, they don't matter much, but add them together and you have a very disappointing film.

The acting? I didn't think it was too bad, actually. Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames, although uninspired,  add weight and authority to the story, but unfortunately, they decide to knock off Rhames early in the film and it goes downhill from there.

The zombies? Crucial to a movie like this, of course. The virus storyline is never explored, just mentioned in passing. The zombies actually manage to be even more energetic and athletic than in the previous (and excellent) Dawn of the Dead remake, which is a feat in itself. They run, jump, climb on the ceiling (seriously), snarl, growl, and flail around like spastics with seizures pretty much non-stop. The transformation from infected normal human being to half-rotten zombie with the skin falling off literally takes place in the blink of an eye.

The FX? Generally decent with some really bad CGI thrown in there.

The story? There isn't much of one. Like I said, the virus aspect is briefly mentioned and then ignored. After that, it's business as usual. Running around, lots of screaming, people being killed, OMG What are we going to do, argh, splat, urgh.

The bottom line? Cheap, sloppy, and rushed. A wasted opportunity.",1206316800,,1524,4.887596899224806
