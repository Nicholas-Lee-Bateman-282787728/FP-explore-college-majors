It makes a great case for medical marijuana but is also a story of people and their relationships. It is about how people commited to a cause can change their own lives and the lives of others. Every one should see this movie it will definately lift your spirits.,1365552000,,365,4.545454545454546
8475907,5,B005JPTE9Y,I saw this film at the Santa Cruz film festival.  I was deeply moved by the more than human stories !!!  This is a great film to widen your blinders and open discussions that need to occur today.  This production company is not only talented but brave & cutting edge.,1334707200,3,267,4.3
