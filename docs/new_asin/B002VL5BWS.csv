3997633,1,B002VL5BWS,"Stieg Larssons' series is pure amoral insanity straight from hell itself. It has no head or tail, all of it is unbelievable rubbish at the highest level. If this is the ""best"" that Swedes can come up with, then I'll think twice before I pay their country a visit. Don't bother, don't waste your precious time as TIME IS MONEY, and this would definitely be the worst investment of it, EVER!

3997655,5,B002VL5BWS,"It is pretty difficult to convey anything other than enormous appreciation to the people  making and directing  a great film, which this film (s) certainly is.
The acting is essentially on a whole other level: one where the characters express their experience  and their reality with a startling level of grief and horror and authenticity.
I see 2-3 films per year...always with happiness and pleasure. If this was my last series of films I could ever see again I would not regret a thing. Absolute masterpiece!

3997662,5,B002VL5BWS,"The Girl Who Played With Fire is a 2009 Swedish murder mystery and thriller, which is a film adaptation of the novel by the same name, that was written by the acclaimed Swedish journalist and author, the late Stieg Larsson. The Girl Who Played With Fire is the second novel in the iconic Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy, and this movie is a sequel to the first film in the series, entitled The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Its story line centers around an investigation into sex trafficking and prostitution in Sweden, which is being conducted by a young journalist who recently joined Millennium Magazine, and a researcher in criminology who is working with him. They have uncovered evidence indicating that law enforcement officers, security service agents, lawyers, judges, and high-ranking government officials are involved in this criminal sex trade. They enlist Mikael Blomqvist, the Millennium investigative journalist and publisher, to assist them in their search for more detailed information, and, subsequently, their inquiry leads to deadly consequences. His friend, Lisbeth Salander, the eccentric punk computer prodigy and hacker, is implicated in this murder and mayhem, and she now must prove her innocence. During the ensuing course of events, shocking details regarding Lisbeth Salanders troubled and tragic past are revealed, as she races against time to clear her name. Once again, the performances of the lead actors, Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist, are absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. The Girl Who Played With Fire is a decidedly intriguing, suspenseful, and captivating murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. The Girl Who Played With Fire features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1507161600,,1949,5.435643564356436

3997667,5,B002VL5BWS,"Loved the American version, but the original is better with Noomi Rapace!

When a troubled investigator joins forces with a disgraced newspaper reporter to seek the murderer of an unsolved crime, their lives become complex beyond their imagination. Is the killer still alive? What did he do with the body of the victim? Who killed her and why? A reporter is hired by a powerful businessman to find the answers in return for a lucrative sum of money. But this could be his final assignment as the killer he seeks appears to be right around the corner.

I do not normally like movies with subtitles but I have to say the subtitles in this one does not take away from the film.  It is very easy to follow even if your just barely reading the English subtitles and watching the action.  Noomi Rapace deserved an Oscar for her part in this.  My husband convinced me to watch the first one and I have now seen all 4 two times.  By the way, I am 66 and do not typically watch this type of movie.  I am very glad I did.

It's a convoluted story already, and I think I'll wait for the English remake. I also had to buy it twice, because the first time, Amazon sent the subtitled version.

3997762,5,B002VL5BWS,"This is the one where the principals get so far into your mind you think your actually living in Sweden.  The strange communication between Lisbeth and Kalle becomes a metaphor for the relationship with truth on Swedish pist-Ear consciousness.  The casting of the trilogy is of course magnificient.  The only character who jangle somewhat is Neidermann who is almost cartoonist but he probably would be on the ""flesh"".  The unrelenting focus on crime and corruption and misogyny in this particular part does not allow for much redeeming intimacy nor affection.  Yet for that price you get for an uncompromising view of how things are in this sold out world, you would understand how Lisbeth would have pushed to the edge.  And thus they were epic scene of rescuing is unforgettable!  Just epic cinema! More moving than the book.  The rewards are many and I recommend this wholeheartedly.",1466726400,,887,4.98639455782313

3997908,4,B002VL5BWS,This second story has less direct interaction between the two main characters and suffers a little from that. But it contains all of the answers as to why Lisbeth is so fierce about not being victimized by anyone. The actress is dressed in a softened and more mature look than the first film.

3997991,4,B002VL5BWS,"I'm a fan of this trilogy and thought the films did the written stories justice.  I just don't understand why screenwriters make changes to so many innocuous things when converting a book to a movie.  It's expected when you're trying to whittle down a large novel to 90 or 120 minute movie, but when they make changes to details the author obviously included intentionally, it makes me scratch my head and ask ""WHY?"".  Regardless, I'm at risk of sounding like one of those jerks who always says ""it wasn't as good as the book"", but I'm not going to say that.  I'd love to see Daniel Craig follow up with this and Kicked the Hornets Nest.....",1450137600,,641,4.5
3997992,5,B002VL5BWS,"The first sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is back to business as usual at Millennium Magazine. The second film quickly ties back to the first film. All three of the films are connected as they tell more of Lisbeths back story and reveal a much larger mystery and conspiracy. The writing acting, and directing are excellent. The characters are deep. The film has action, drama, mystery, romance, and beautiful locations. This film reveals more of Lisbeths story from both before and after the first film, while it deals with another seemingly unrelated mystery. This trilogy is nine and a half hours long in the extended edition and you will want to re-watch it.",1449792000,,671,4.793103448275862

3997994,5,B002VL5BWS,"This is a great film, and a faithful adaptation of Stieg Larsson's novel. This was great writing and the acting in the movie is faithful to the author. The plot is streamlined, of course. That is the nature of things. The actors and actresses who starred in the first film continue on, which helps the viewer connect. I thought the sex scenes could have been toned down a bit. I don't have to see everything to know what is going on.
It held my interest throughout as a touching portrayal of a girl, victimized by society, who would not allow herself to be a mere victim. Lisbeth is certainly a memorable character of literature, and now film.",1449187200,,643,4.504273504273504

The English speaking reader must get accustomed to the hard to pronounce Swedish cities and towns and neighborhoods but eventually you can breeze right through, knowing pretty much where you are geographically.

3998118,5,B002VL5BWS,"After seeing the American produced film with Daniel Craig, I was surprised to run into the movie where it was originally made with English sub-titling.  It was better than the American film.  I then discovered that there was a second and a third film based on the original three books.  I found those as well on Amazon Prime and then best of all I discovered the Triology of all 3 books packaged with 2 hours of otherwise omitted scenes.
As a move buff, I would much prefer a longer movie fully told and written and presented well than to try to watch a shorter version that often is so ""chopped up"" it leaves the watching audience picking apart the flow of the story.  ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST STORIES (ALL 3 BOOKS) AND THEN THE TRIOLOGY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!  MEANT FOR ADULTS, IT DRAWS YOU IN AND WON'T LET GO OF YOU UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THE COMPLETE SET WITH TWO ADDITIONAL HOURS OF FOOTAGE!!

The books find a balance between the heroism of the female and male characters, with both genders having their moment to shine.  The movie downplays the heroism of the male characters making it a less enjoyable film adaptation of the book.

A nice balance of exposition and action, we follow Lisbeth's tortured journey to connect her past with her present -- through her investigative involvement with a current Swedish social evil -- this time white slavery/forced prostitution, last time it was serial killings. My only criticism is that for a person who is very clever and strong, she blunders into obvious traps and like ""The Terminator"" continues to survive many otherwise-fatal run-ins with bad guys.",1436745600,,610,5.171717171717172

There is a brooding and simmering quality to the whole movie.  Be ready to lose a few hours focusing on all that is occurring.  The use of atmosphere added a lot.,1436054400,,316,4.288135593220339

3998401,5,B002VL5BWS,This is the second part of a trilogy and actually my favorite movie of all time.  The American version can't hold a candle to this Swedish masterpiece.  You must see all three in order.,1434412800,,185,4.411764705882353

3998428,5,B002VL5BWS,"Yes, this is in Swedish. Yes, there are subtitles. That should not scare you away from watching the second and third movies in this series. Personally I think the subtitles are a little suspect but oh well. The extended version of these films are well worth your time and effort.

3998433,5,B002VL5BWS,"Of course, the trilogy of Lizbeth Salander must  be read first - before watching any of the movies, which, of course, must be viewed in proper order. The three movies (Tatoo, Fire, Hornet's Nest) are terrific, but as with most movie adaptations, the scripts had to conform to certain time limitations, so that many peripheral characters and events which enriched the main storylines had to be written out. Its a shame Stieg Larrson died before he could see how successful his trilogy became, or had a chance to see the movies adapted from his books. All-in-all, I am sure he would have given them each 4 1/2 stars, minimum. Noomi Rapace is the actress who should have been nominated for an Academy Award, not her English counterpart, who did nothing more than copy Noomi's every move and look.",1433808000,,793,4.746376811594203

3998455,5,B002VL5BWS,"Amazing movie in an amazing trio of movies adapted from Stieg Larson's Millennium Trilogy. Everything about these movies is superb, from the screenplay, to the directing and the superb acting.  Not one actor or actress misses the mark in in bringing each one Larson's character  to the screen, especially Noomi Rapace playing the lead role of Lisbeth Solander.  My wife and I had read all three novels a few years ago, and I must speculate that this fact added to our enjoyment of this very complex story of a young girl, now a young woman victimized by her country's legal and social service systems.  Strangely, choosing to watch the extended version with English subtitles instead of English dubbed added to our enjoyment.

Although I haven't read the books yet, the acting is superb and the action scenes are very raw and well executed at the same time. This is a very complex and realistic storyline that goes between mystery and detective. I would highly recommended this and hope that you are well prepared to watch this. If you're weak in the stomach then you better tighten it up, because you are in for a serious story plot ;-)",1431388800,,535,4.36

3998565,5,B002VL5BWS,"I've seen all the other versions -- including the extended Swedish/Danish theatrical releases -- but this 'ultimate' Magnum re-release of the original 9 hour 17 minute Danish TV mini-series was far and away the best!!!  Even with this jumbo version, they couldn't fit in all the side-plots and socio-political side-bars of the novels, but there are many shorter filler scenes that help with background & continuity, and so help the storyline move along in a more coherent manner.  The added material in Book One 'dragon tattoo' were nice, but not as helpful.  The 4 video chapters for books 2 & 3 had much more useful additions, which clarified more around the history of the 'The Section' and its sinister development into a rogue outfit.  Again, my only 'complaint' was that they still had to leave out some fairly interesting sub-plots from the books, such as the career cross-roads decision faced by Erika Berger, and the developing relationship between Mika and agent Monika Figuerola...  maybe they'll film a 12-hour version some day.",1430697600,,1040,5.058479532163743

This one has characters that are lost and not being themselves (even though the cast is same) and the direction and cinematography that are suboptimal. The movie is unable to build any sense of suspense or anticipation. Disappointing I must say. I wonder if the Director for this is different than that for the first one.",1420156800,,587,4.87

Therefore, I know the storyline and very much like to watch Swedish movies with subtitles to practice and learn more of the language.  If you find subtitled movies a chore to watch, then I would skip this and watch the dubbed version - although I have not seen that version and can't comment on it.

Overall, the story stayed pretty close to the book - of course many details from the book were left out, but what made it into the move was largely unchanged.  There were some minor differences in order to make the movie flow - and only one change that I was really disappointed to see near the end.  I won't spoil it for you.

Not sure what else to say - the HD quality is very good and the subtitles seemed to be a pretty good translation although I am no expert.  If you are offended by language or themes of sexual nature, then I'd skip this movie.",1401235200,,963,4.229508196721311

I have not read the books, so I cannot compare them to the author's version. They are cliff hangers. If you are a fundamentalist against certain behavior don't watch it. I don't want to see your rant about religious values. But if you are looking for suspense and action and are open minded it is a good movie.",1392768000,,579,4.37037037037037

I kept waiting for the other two remakes but finally gave in to viewing these two English dubbed versions of The Girl Who Played WIth Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest.  While not as technically edgy as the remake version of Girl...Tatoo they were quite good.  I did not read the books but believe that they carried the story line true to the original story line. The English dubbing was well done and did not distract from the pace or the action.  If these are remade in the future, I would definitely see them as a comparison to these two movies.  I would expect that a current remake with the advances and availability of new filming techniques would be technically superior.

As a movie, this one was not as good as the first one. As outlandish as the first movie was, the story was believable.  This one teeters on the brink of unbelievability and makes a good movie almost laughable at points. At least its not as bad as the third one though!",1390176000,2,499,4.333333333333333
3998875,4,B002VL5BWS,"Good movie but a bit choppy if you haven't read the books.  Stayed fairly close to the printed book.  The camera work was very good but the plot wandered with gaps and miniscule items getting a lot more effort than they warranted.  Acting was all right and i do like the European trend to use actors that can act and not little plastic cut outs with large plastic grafts.  The movie ended with a ""Next Week Chapter 2"" ending like a Saturday matinee of old.  It must be really hard to generate real passion when you are stuck trying to do the twenty third remake of a stock situation movie.  The dubbing was bad but trying to get English to match up with any northern or eastern European language is almost impossible.",1389830400,,717,4.393939393939394

3998931,1,B002VL5BWS,"This movie is bad in all angles such as directing, editing and acting.

The directing and editing make the film very choppy. Many times, I can clearly see separate scenes were clumsily seamed together.  It is more like a bad TV show than a movie.

The fighting scenes are laughable. For example, the scene where the main female character beat the two bikers is so unrealistic, clumsy and not convincing. Yuck!

The acting does not help either.

It contains many gigantic logical holes. They substantially reduce the entertainment value of this picture.

According to darkhorizons dot com/films/796/The-Girl-Who-Played-with-Fire,
its production Budget is $11 million.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:
Release Date: July 9, 2010
Domestic:  $7,638,241
+ Foreign:  $59,488,554
= Worldwide:  $67,126,795

So, it is a big flop in North America. It lost approximately 3 million of dollars here.

3998936,3,B002VL5BWS,"Dubbed versions of foreign-language films distort the expression of the film. Actors' intonation is an important element of the communicative power of a scene. Having a disconnected, disembodied voice superimposed on top of what the actor in the scene has performed physically always serves to misrepresent the intentions of the creators of the work.  Simply put, dubbed versions are never as good. Amazon shouldn't offer them; you should only offer subtitled versions of foreign-language films.

I watched the ""dubbed"" version so not sure what people they used to translate to English, but the voices sounded totally different than the originals, which lost a lot of impact with me.

More is revealed about the main character, Lisbeth Salander, as her heroism continues to shine.  I have never seen a movie with a story even similar to this one which makes it so very unique.  As with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at the end of the movie, I was ready for more.

3999000,5,B002VL5BWS,This second film continues to develop Stieg Larsson's brilliant story. The foreign language with English subtitles actually enhances the experience and embeds you in Sweden where the whole story takes place.,1377734400,,207,5.709677419354839
3999001,5,B002VL5BWS,"The book is fabulous, the original Swedish movies are great, the English dubbed version - SUUUUUUUUUCKS.

The Swedish version with English subtitled is superior in every way to the dubbed version. Very well made, I've watched the set a few times since it was released.

I have absolutely no interest in seeing the American made version of this trilogy.

I am looking forward to going back and reading the books again, they are so good!

The people doing the English voiceovers are absolutely awful! Flat as a pancake, no affect, they sound as though they are merely sitting there reading rather than professional voice actors who put everything into it as though they were the actors themselves.

I had to stop watching the dubbed version and go back to subtitles.  I highly recommend listening to the Swedish language, but having the English subtitles = infinitely better than the version dubbed with English speakers - they can't possibly be actors, they merely read the lines with no inflection, no emotion. It's very odd.",1377648000,,1025,4.930232558139535

A couple of scenes could have been better but it did not take away from the movie. I will not mention them so as not to spoil it for those who have not seen the movie.  Some may not even recognize the scenes I am thinking of....and that's ok because the movie is just as good as the first one, but ...dragon tattoo is my favorite so far.

Barely follows the book, just sad all the way around.  Until they film it in America, if they do, I'd say stick with the book and forget about watching this!

3999023,3,B002VL5BWS,"Lisbeth is still brilliant and sexy, as in the first installment of the trilogy, but not as much and not nearly as much as Rooney Mara in the American version. Also the villain is insufficiently creepy, though they try awfully hard to scum him up. The cruelty of the parole officer's death is very disappointing -- grossly deficient, though I might have been too drunk by point in the movie to have gotten every bit of it. I wanted to see some real squirming, writhing agony, a nice desert to follow the delicious repast chef Salander served up with her wonderfully vicious revenge on this slime bag in the first movie. Altogether, this movie a decent effort. Sequels of course are notorious for being insufficiently satisfying, designed as they are to exploit an audience already hooked. I'll watch the third installment, and (with high anticipation) the American remakes.",1376006400,,873,4.905405405405405

Don't know if the US versions 2 and 3 will ever be made, so watched the Swedish versions. Tried the dubbed version for 5 minutes, but I'd rather read the lines,  than see the out-of-synch lips. The acting and script is quite good, and my preference for the US vs. the Swedish switched back and forth depending on the scene - sometimes I like the Swedish version better, sometimes I preferred the US adaptation.",1375228800,,540,4.510204081632653
3999029,4,B002VL5BWS,Gave this film 4 stars. It would have probably gotten 5 stars but I would have rather had it subtitled instead of dubbed in English. I like to see and hear the original actors.,1375228800,,176,4.205882352941177

3999031,4,B002VL5BWS,I liked the first one better.  The American version that is.  Haven't watched the original Dragon Tattoo though. This explained a lot of the first movie.  My only caveat is the English dubbing.  Felt like I was in a Kung Fu movie.  Pretty bad voice over acting.  I would prefer to read sub titles in the language.  A little awkward at first but I personally like it better.,1375142400,,373,4.397058823529412

3999046,4,B002VL5BWS,"Since I saw this movie last week and so much has been going on since then, all I can say is that this was a satisfying second movie in the series. The end of the movie had me on edge; but, all in all, it's a must-see if you've already seen ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."" The only down-side was the dubbing. I prefer the original language with subtitles.",1374624000,,357,4.114285714285714

3999049,3,B002VL5BWS,"If you read my review of the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you'll know my love for these movies.  I didn't enjoy the second movie nearly as much because I decided to give the english-dubbed version a chance so I wouldn't have to read subtitles.  Boy, was that a mistake.  I don't know who they hired to dub the actors, but they made poor choices all around.  You totally lose the nuance of the acting in the original language. Even though you're reading subtitles when watching the original language version, the power of the performances more than compensates for having to read dialogue.

This story was as engrossing as the first, and revealed a lot more of the backstory that was set up in the original.  I highly recommend it, but only if you watch the original Swedish version with subtitles.  And forget the American version all together.",1374451200,,867,4.6644736842105265

I think some of the middle portion of the movie was left out. I'm sorry to give it such a low rating as I have enjoyed all of these movies in the past and the English dubbing is excellent, but based on what we received when we saw it this time, I can't give it much of a rating.",1373500800,,409,3.8

Feels a bit like a highschool kid did the video editing and planning. It's a bunch of disconnected skits with very poor transitions or segways from one to the other. The acting is very mechanical and almost lifeless, but I suppose the story lends itself to being portrayed un-emotionally.",1370649600,,412,4.816901408450704
3999102,2,B002VL5BWS,"Not nearly as good as the other two in this trilogy.  I had a hard time forcing myself to stick it through to the end.

Once again, it probably loses a lot in the translation.",1370563200,,175,3.9714285714285715
3999103,4,B002VL5BWS,"The use of the same characters to continue the original movie provides continuity and continued excellent drama. The movie follows the book closely providing a smooth flow of the plot and is very spellbinding.  I enjoyed watching it.  The only drawback to this version of the movie is that it has been shortened with scenes cut out or dialog shortened, and therefore is different than the version that has been playing on the Sundance Dish channel.",1370476800,,448,4.881578947368421

3999106,5,B002VL5BWS,"Part 2 of a Trilogy, great story, would have like to have seen some continuity with the same stars from the first flick (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). The price, service, and packaging were great from the vendor.",1370390400,,212,4.605263157894737
3999107,5,B002VL5BWS,"This has it all; love, intrigue, action, compassion. Although this is dubbed, it does not distract.  I loved this movie, as well as the rest of this trilogy.  It is well worth watching!",1370390400,,185,4.575757575757576
3999108,3,B002VL5BWS,"I think the first one was better.
In this 2nd movie, it is more of a character study
of Lisbeth, where she came from and how she
became the person she is today.",1370131200,,160,3.878787878787879
3999109,4,B002VL5BWS,"Although tolerable the dubbing was out of sync in places, also the actors voices did not match their appearance.

3999111,5,B002VL5BWS,"Engrossing if seen as a stand alone movie AND you have not seen any other in the series.  I thought I would enjoy the entire series starting with the beginning.  Big Mistake!  I have now watched the first two in the series and feel that the series only rates three stars.  If I had seen The Girl Who Played with Fire as part of the series, I would probably would have given it only three stars because the novelty of the many characters would have been lost.",1369785600,,458,4.2298850574712645

3999128,5,B002VL5BWS,"There is an honestly to this film that is lacking in Hollywood made movies. Additionally, the themes are unique to Europe, and I enjoyed seeing this viewpoint.",1368662400,,159,4.925925925925926
3999129,5,B002VL5BWS,Adheres to the spirit of the book both in narrative and characterization.  The movie is very well acted and shot.,1368576000,,113,4.65
3999130,4,B002VL5BWS,I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did.  I read the three books and was disappointed in the US film released last year.  It was incomprehensible to most who did not read the books. and crammed too much into the story.  I liked this production because it focused on telling the story more clearly from one of the books.  The acting was excellent and the dubbing was very good.  I liked the transformation of the main character as she appeared in court.  Very well written and directed.,1368489600,,498,4.417582417582418
3999131,5,B002VL5BWS,Liked hd but best in original swedish.  Far better than the American version.  I thought the acting was much better in the original too.,1368489600,,136,4.625
3999132,5,B002VL5BWS,Great follow up to Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo.  Great explanation of Lizbeth's back story.  A good sequel. I recommend it.,1368489600,,124,4.857142857142857
3999133,5,B002VL5BWS,"Just like the book, but without half of the rich detail, this adaptation keeps one on the edge of their understanding the whole time. Everything draws you in and confounds your mind.",1368489600,,182,4.71875
3999134,5,B002VL5BWS,"The Girl who played with Fire is a movie to watch over again and I am very anxious to see the other movies by this well known author who I do realize has passed.  The actors are magnificent in their rolls and the story it's self brings to mind what is happening right here in our own back yard.  Sex Trafficking of Children is not only in Sweden, but around the World we live in.  Now what are you going to do about stopping this Crime against innocent Children?

If the other movies are as great as this one, I suggest we all sit down and watch each and everyone of them. I so look forward to reading the books on my Kindle hopefully I get one this year.

Make sure you do not take a break for this movie, as it is a sit still moment for the viewer to not miss a clue that is offered throughout this movie.  Enjoy and tell others about this magnificent movie with wonderful Actors who I hope to see again.

3999136,5,B002VL5BWS,"Enjoyed the last movie of this series even though the star was mostly locked in a medical facility. Very easy to follow with the sub titles, especially if you have read all three books.",1367712000,,185,4.470588235294118
3999137,4,B002VL5BWS,"Even though the dubbing in English is a bit annoying, you get used to it and it's easy to get involved with the plot and characters.  Good Series.  I recommend the next one in the series ""the girl who kicked the hornets nest"" as well",1367712000,,233,4.155555555555556
3999138,5,B002VL5BWS,This movie was an excellent second part to the trilogy. Great story and well acted. I really enjoyed it. It was dubbed in English and that did not take anything away from the movie,1367539200,,180,4.323529411764706
3999139,4,B002VL5BWS,I liked it. It was suspenseful & had a lot of action. Some of my friends that saw it did not like it which was surprising to me.,1367452800,,128,3.607142857142857
3999140,5,B002VL5BWS,"I have read all three novel and I must say that I was pleased with the movie, it was true to the book, which is something that is rare.",1367452800,,135,3.689655172413793
3999141,5,B002VL5BWS,this movie i found quote entertaining...the only drawback was having to read the captions...i think that this girl plays a more realistic verson of her character than mara.,1367452800,,172,5.178571428571429
3999142,4,B002VL5BWS,"I liked it, it was a very intense movie and the characters were portrayed convincingly.  I will watch the rest of series without hesitation.",1367452800,,140,4.833333333333333
3999143,1,B002VL5BWS,"Why not just leave the movie alone and give it subtitles.  The dubbed voices are horrible, makes me feel like Im watching a 70's kung-fu flick.",1367280000,,143,4.5
3999164,4,B002VL5BWS,"Love the series, very close to the book storyline. I think I like this Salander better than the US movie version. She follows more closely to the books version of her character.",1367107200,,177,4.5625
3999165,3,B002VL5BWS,I think I goofed up on review with Look Inside.  This move was okay and had very good information there in.  Worth one look.,1366761600,,124,4.125
3999166,4,B002VL5BWS,"The dubbing to English is well done. The Swedish versions seem closer to the books. Noomi Rapace captures the spirit of
Lisbeth Salander",1366329600,,136,4.956521739130435
3999167,1,B002VL5BWS,"I came to Scandinavian thrillers by accident, knowing that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was the most famous precursor; I've enjoyed Wallander, Forbrydelsen, Broen, Borgen, even look alikes from other countries like Engrenages, so I thought I would be in for a treat with TGWTDT and this sequel... While I didn't think much of the first movie, this second one is hilariously bad, it's just one cliche after another... Evil Russians... Brawny Germans... Hacker heroine... The low point being action shots which were speeded up to show just how fast the heroine is...",1365984000,,567,5.042553191489362
3999168,5,B002VL5BWS,"This final version of the three books is, in my judgement, the most satisfying read.  The English dubbing was near perfect - it was hard to believe that it wasn't in its original source.",1365897600,,186,4.470588235294118
3999169,4,B002VL5BWS,The overall movie was well acted and the directing was excellent. The movie held my attention throughout. For the first time I was actually interested enough to watch the sequel.,1365811200,,178,4.966666666666667
3999170,3,B002VL5BWS,"Unfortunately, this was only available in the English dubbed version. I prefer subtitles in foreign films. The movie was good, but the dubbing is more destacting than anything.",1365811200,,176,5.321428571428571
3999171,3,B002VL5BWS,"Excellent book.  Good film adaptation.  I found the dubbing distracting.  The English subtitled ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was much better.",1365811200,,146,5.545454545454546
3999172,5,B002VL5BWS,"As the third in the series, like the book, the best.  Too bad there won't be more by Steig Larsson",1365638400,,98,3.9
3999173,4,B002VL5BWS,"It was good film to watch AFTER having read the book. There are so many story lines and details that are not portrayed (I am sure due to time constraints) that I think the movie may be confusing for quite some time to a viewer that had not read the book.  Also, there are some differences in details, some for the sake of the movie, but some are unexplainable.  Regardless, it was good see the book portrayed in film.",1365465600,,417,4.265822784810126
3999174,5,B002VL5BWS,"In order to truly appreciate this movie, you must first read the ""Girl Who"" trilogy.  I loved it but I think without a knowledge of the books a viewer might not really comprehend all that is happening.",1365465600,,201,4.4324324324324325

If you haven't seen that one, order it as well, and you are in for a chilling, cold, Swedish style noirish film. This second film acts as a bridge between the first and third installments, although I do think I would have enjoyed it as a much. Lisbeth Salander is a computer hacker teamed up with an investigative journalist, Mikhail Blomkvist, working for a muckraking journal called ""Millenium"". The murder mystery is engrossing, but it is fleshed out with all manner of intrigue. See it!

3999179,5,B002VL5BWS,The sub-titled version is better only because you know it's Noomi's voice and that makes a world of difference. The movie is really good sub-titled or not.  Highly recommend it.,1364947200,,177,4.9
3999180,3,B002VL5BWS,"The plot was good (as was the book.)  The acting was decent, but the overall movie fell flat.  I think the execution was less than I expected.

3999183,2,B002VL5BWS,This series is wonderful but the stilted sounding English dubbing ruined this version of the movie for me.  Watch the subtitled version or wait till the US version is released.,1364774400,,176,4.866666666666666
3999194,5,B002VL5BWS,This story continues the excitement and revenge from the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo and leads you right into the Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  Great movies!,1364774400,,162,4.785714285714286
3999195,5,B002VL5BWS,"A B- movie on its own.  Watch the trilogy as a miniseries (even better if you can get all six parts instead of the trimmed versions) and it's terrific.  Not really many new characters, just no backstory to identify who may be doing what to whom. After about the first 20 minutes you won't care much either way.",1364601600,,310,4.327586206896552

When before you thought it was a great story, you now start to see that there is a lot more to it then a simple thirst for knowledge and justice.  While the fanaticism of the magazine writer borderlines on excessive compulsive, it helps drive the story and the girl to act in ways that should by now be expected and yet, still surprise.",1364256000,,485,4.377777777777778

3999199,4,B002VL5BWS,I really enjoyed this suspense thriller! I just can't wait until they come out with an American version so you don't have to hear English dubbed in! Other than that it was really good!,1364169600,,184,4.4411764705882355

3999202,5,B002VL5BWS,"This series of three books and the Swedish movies are the best ever.  Absolutely A+ entertainment.  The English version was bad, no wonder they made only the first movie but the Sweds did the job right and all three are spectacular.",1363824000,,232,4.634146341463414

3999210,5,B002VL5BWS,"Understated but powerful performancesn' by the whole cast (Rapace is astonishing!).
Ultra-creepy & suspenseful murder mysteries.
Lovely cliche dropping of the bullet into stainless
container. A feminist's revenge fantasy come true.
Too bad Steig Larsson didn't live to complete all 10 volumes he planned (he - apparently - couldn't  handle the cancer-sticks as well as Ms. Salander!)",1363219200,,383,5.719298245614035

3999213,2,B002VL5BWS,"Unless you are a massive fan of the franchise, have read the books and/or watch this right after you watch the first film, save your time.  Both my girlfriend and I fell asleep in the middle.  The acting was fine but there are plenty of other films that are better and worth more of your time.",1362787200,,293,4.214285714285714
3999224,5,B002VL5BWS,"Noomi Rapace played this part dynamically. I didn't know who she was until these 3 series of movies. Very good character actor, she should have been nominated for an Academy Award!",1362787200,,180,4.838709677419355
3999225,5,B002VL5BWS,great second movie in the series. Dub. in English so you do not have to read while watching. Would recommend this and the first movie. Have not seen the third yet,1362787200,,162,4.258064516129032

3999228,5,B002VL5BWS,"If you're thinking of watching this sequel, you must've already seen the first, and this is a great next part. Fabulous acting, script, movie-making, everything.

I was curious how this movie could *ever* get a 1 star, so to save you time, these are the reasons it's gotten them:
- upset about the English dub being terrible (this is why I only read subtitles - so maybe avoid the dub)
- upset they meant to order DVD but ordered online (yeah, Amazon is awesome, and if you'd just e-mail them they'd refund you and fix it. Don't be lazy).
- can't understand or appreciate international movies (I can't even comment on this w.o being condescending)
- thinks Swedish version terrible compared to American version (see previous bullet; IMO, both are great, but for different reasons - American version is much more action, this one is much more dark drama).

Having watched Girl With the Dragon Tattoo with subtitles, I found I didn't like the dubbed version at all - you are not getting the true feel of the characters with someone else's voice dubbed in. The movie was great, love that it follows the book. The characters are well cast, Noomi Rapace IS Salandar. Although the movie is subtitled, you really don't notice it. There are many words that are the same in English and Swedish, I found I understood what they were saying a great deal of the time without having to read the subtitles.",1362441600,,590,4.5233644859813085

I would highly recommend all three of these episodes, especially if you are a Prime Member since they are all free.  I was going to buy the trilogy online but have saved the money.  I also recommend that Kindle Fire HD owners purchase the cable to watch all Kindle movies or videos on your HDTV.  The 15 foot cable only costs $9.95 with Prime free shipping.  The cable goes from the small port next to where the charger goes, to your television's HDMI port and allows watching on your big screen.  What could be better??",1362009600,,685,4.557377049180328

3999254,5,B002VL5BWS,"If I have to watch a foreign movie, for the effort of reading the subtitles, it had better be good. This movie, in fact, exceeded my expectations! This is truly a thriller. The cinematography is wonderful and the picture clarity in HD is outstanding especially when it is fairly new (2010) movie.

This movie is part of a trilogy (all 3 movies are superb). Make sure you watch it in this correct sequence:

1. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo
2. The Girl Who Played With Fire (probably the best of the three)
3. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest

Note that the subtitled versions of the above movies are better than the English dubbed movies. The dubbed versions seem to downplay the otherwise fabulous audio and background sound.

I am so happy that it is available on Amazon Prime for free. Even if it were not, I would have paid to rent it! Yeah, that's how good it is!

If you like this movie, you will likely also like ""Headhunters,"" a movie from Norway that is subtitled in English. Another nice foreign movie is the German movie ""North Face"" (English Subtitled) that is very gripping. If you are into romances, check out the Dutch movie, ""Bride Flight"". All these other movies have an average star rating of 4 or higher on Amazon.",1361577600,,1240,4.517857142857143

It was very reminiscent of the dubbing used with Japanese cartoons (Lifeless, lacking inflection, and not matching the characters, at all). If you allow yourself to get past the bad dubbing, it is a great story. The scenes with no dialogue were the best, as the actors really were able to show the original emotion and motive intended.

As it usually goes, books are better than movies as there is so much more detail to them.  I was very happy to review the first movie positively, though, as it was Very well done/written!  This second time around I read 95% of the book, THEN watched the movie....that made the movie so much more intense.  And, I was not disappointed at all.  The Swedish version is great, the screen-play writer(s) did such a great job staying as true as possible to the book, with the slightest/subtlest of changes, in order to keep it to 3 hours or less.  (side note: there is currently no Hollywood version....which is fine, however, I do like Mara's character's look better. Don't get me wrong Rapace is also perfect in the role, but I feel the make-up artists made her too ""pretty"" for the character...maybe bleach the eyebrows or something)...HA.

The action continues as well as the suspense. Once again there are answers and more questions about this girl. I love Noomi in this. Her need for independence is demonstrated fiercely as well as her need to set things right in unheard-of devotion to friends. A certain Achilles of  naivety, however, is unexpectedly revealed.

Salander's finger prints are found on the murder weapon. Her troubled past along with the evidence make her the prime suspect. Mikael is the only person who believes that she is innocent. He soon finds evidence that implicates high ranking officials in Sweedish society. He is also shocked when he learns about her past. The biggest problem is that nobody can find Salander anywhere.

This is a worthy sequel to an incredible movie. I loved the 1st film and this one is no different. I haven't read the novels, so I can't give an opinion on the conversion to movie status. I can, however, say that the movie trilogy stands by itself as a masterpiece and is definitely worth watching. They are filled with mystery, suspense, drama, and shocking plot twists. I believe that the twists and turns make these films as great as they are. In addition to the great acting.

3999346,3,B002VL5BWS,"Although this was my least favorite of the Millenium trilogy books, I thought the film did a good job of capturing the menacing tone at the heart of the story and managed to get most of the essential plot points in.  Yes, it may have added to the story if there had been more about Lisbeth's newfound wealth and her discussion with her financial manager to put that in context, but in the interest of putting together a movie that moved along and didn't get bogged down in numerous superfluous-to-the-main-plot storylines, I appreciated the screenwriter's ability to include the major threads essential to the story.  The acting by Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace was superb.  Love them!  And hands down, the Swedish films are much better than the U.S. version (so far at least).  I would have given this particular version four stars but the dubbing was awful.  It wasn't just a matter of dialogue not matching the movement of the lips; the voices didn't match the characters, the inflections were all wrong, and the dialogue was robotic, like it was just being read as a bunch of words, not as a dramatic script.  I found the subtitled version on another site and found it a much more compelling drama because I wasn't constantly put off by the inappropriate dubbing.

The lead character has done an amazing job. So great, that some scenes are difficult to watch because she's brought the torture to life. Go see it, but read the book before you do.

3999368,3,B002VL5BWS,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo's impact has made its way around the movie industry very quickly. In fact, maybe too quickly. It's already being remade, before its sequel had a chance to become as popular. Nonetheless, The Girl Who Played With Fire is in theatres now, and while it may not be as good as its predecessor, it's still pretty good crime thriller. The mystery aspect of these stories is what makes them. Thank god this movie uses it to its full advantage. I found myself getting more and more intrigued in the story as it progressed. That's always a good thing. That said, I did find many scenes amateurish due to the low budget. I definitely cannot, and will not hold that against it. But they can do magic with small budgets these days (a la District 9). There may be a few issues here and there, but the good outweighs the bad. This is a very well written film. I won't say that for the dialogue, because I spent the entire time reading subtitles obviously, and who knows how they tamper with translations, but the screenplay is well executed and tight. The acting is great as well. Very believable, which is what lacks in many films today.

Mainly our leads, and most of the supporting actors/actresses did fantastic jobs. I wasn't too impressed with the big blonde Russian. He reminded me too much of the Russian from The Punisher. His character did not require very much range, but I think he could have been a little better. Like I said, the leads were great though. Noomi Rapace returns as Lisabeth Salander, and she is perfect. Michael Nyqvist also returns as Mikael Blomkvist. I'm anxious to see Daniel Craig fill his shoes in the remake. So, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you have seen the first one. If not, you should definitely pick it up or watch it on demand, or whatever you choose. I suggest you see that one first, if you have not yet. This one is a good follow up to that story. I probably would not have liked it as much if I hadn't seen the first one. There is one more book in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, called The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest (I believe). I look forward to seeing the conclusion to this trilogy on the screen.

Each actor brings to the screen award winning performances and in many ways, because these films are in Swedish, the viewer is gently pushed into being more aware of body language and facial expressions.

First, you just can't make a 90 minute movie for any of the Millennium Series books and do them justice.  There is just too much packed into the books and all that information is why the books have been such a hit.  While the extended version still didn't capture it all, it is much more engrossing and enjoyable than the shortened version.

Secondly, the dubbed version doesn't do the actors justice.  And there are times when the actual dialogue is changed to fit the movement of the actor's lips.  And that hurts the story line.  I thought I'd be too distracted reading the subtitles but when you take into consideration you get the real emotion and the real translation, the subtitles are only a minor problem.

Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev for Yellow Bird Films; Mikael Blomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) and Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace); original three novels written by the late Swedish mystery novelist Stieg Larsson and superbly edited by Eva Gabrielsson. We are easily swept up in the complex, hyper-intriguing hunt by our heroine Lisbeth for a serial killer presented in a stunning sequential order of unfolding events and plot twists - that hold one almost in amazement at times.

So much has been written about these tightly-woven films and their positive impact upon women and girls around the world, their influence on the romance-thriller genre in novel writing & screenwriting, their ferocity to tell a high-end story about a pair of fiercely intelligent serial killers and still keep it reigned into a powerful but digestible film storyline, and their tenacity to reel in the sub-plots and multiple plot endings into a precise denouement along a superior crescendo or ascending mode of action with an original wildly-filmed plot. Depth of character, sustained plot tension, and powerful, realistic acting performances dominate each film in such a way - that we want to see them again.

Once in awhile we see these brilliant, pro-women, pro-active film trilogies take off and make their way into multiple languages - as if all along they were meant to be translated at breadneck speed throughout the world - so one and all - women and men - can drive a long distance to catch one or two of these films in sequence at a single movie theatre. And we are talking about movie goers going out in perhaps severe weather condition to see any one of these cinematic masterpieces. Realism, honesty, thorough journalistic practices, true mystery & suspense scriptwriting & storyboarding, sado-masochistic & erotic side-plots that tightly weave like electrifying eels returning to their comfort lair - back into the original storyline - all create an experiential type of cinema - that becomes exhilarating, challenging to the senses, sensual, and intensely played out for our enjoyment and enrichment.",1333411200,3,2466,5.209068010075566

3999398,4,B002VL5BWS,"This sequel is an obvious bridge to the concluding part 3.  It is none the less a near equal to ""Dragon Tattoo"".  A different director injects a lot more characters than we saw in the original, so it's sometimes difficult to pay attention when you have to read all the fast dialog.  And several subtitles blend into the background making it even harder to see.

Like ""Dragon Tattoo"", once the movie it gets going you just have to hang on.  The leads are terrific, especially Noomi Rapace who once again sizzles as Lisabeth.  I can't put my finger on it, but this flat-chested wisp of a young woman with unremarkable looks is remarkably beautiful and sexy.  And she is afraid of nothing which occasionally gets her in hot water.  She is being framed for murder and her sometime ally, Mikael, believes she's innocent.  I only nudge this film down half a star because of the limited screen time together Lisabeth and Mikael share.  Only at the end to they get together.  With the chemistry they have, that was a disappointment.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The colors and clarity are fine although I'm not sure the darker scenes are transfer issues or the director's choice.  Some seem a bit weak.  Not a big deal unless you're watching in a strongly lit room.  The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 in both Swedish and English version.

She's a computer hacker, researcher, bisexual, mysterious, and complicated all at once. The actress who played her in the Swedish trilogy deserved Oscar nominations. She said more with an expression than with words.

Lisbeth Salander could be considered a modern day feminist or just a revolutionary character who isn't bound by cultural norms and rules. In this second part of the installment which I accidentally skipped out of order, we learn about Lisbeth's past history and her background. You can't help but feel sympathy towards her. But anyway, the film takes off where the first one ended with her on the islands.

She returns to Sweden where she is implicated in a triple homicide. There is more to the story but I won't spoil it for you. Although I did think that the homicides weren't really clearly explained in this installment, the film takes a turn more with regards to Lisbeth's history. Anyway her friend and lover, Michael Blomquist, is back to defend her while the cast remains the same.

Even with subtitles, I still liked this film and Stockholm has never looked more beautiful. I have never been there but I do wish too one day.

My only complaint is that I wished there was something about the making of the film in the special features or a biography of the author who died before his works were published.",1327536000,,1490,4.785992217898833

Having seen the first film with sub-titles which left a lot to be desired in being able to read them, I was glad to find the dubbed version.

I definitely will try to read them as I believe they will flesh this out with other material not shown in the film.

3999441,2,B002VL5BWS,"I had a rainy, gloomy, dreary day off and was going through netflix on-demand when i noticed that the entire trilogy was featured on there.  So, i decided to watch the first movie to see what it was all about.... INCREDIBLE.  i loved it; it reminded me a lot of one of my other favorites; se7en.  Very creepy and original.  I got all excited and said ""this is great!!""  ""I'm gonna watch the whole series!!!""  So i watched 'The Girl Who Played With Fire"" and was incredibly let down... I was so so disappointed that i decided to post a negative review; my first.

  To this movie's credit, it would be a decent movie if it didn't have to follow ""dragon tattoo"" because it is absolutely a completely different film than the aforementioned.  Gone is the dark, creepy, brooding, slow paced, and quite realistic(for a movie at least) detective story.  This is a bourne movie.  It's even lit like a bourne movie.  It's incredibly fast paced, has multiple story lines involving less than secondary characters(some random boxer dude and lisbeths girlfriend), and it totally abandons the original plot halfway through the movie.  This is not a creepy serial killer mystery like the first installment.  This is a movie about Lisbeth Solander and her dysfunctional family.  Unlike ""Tattoo""  you know you are watching a production here and at parts it feels a little contrived and has very little realism.  They shoulda stayed with the original director!

Speaking of SE7EN, David Fincher has signed on to remake the trilogy, and considering the mans past work, i'm very interested to see what he brings to the table regarding the second and third parts of this series....

Sorry for posting a negative review, as i now a lot of people liked this movie.  I honestly tried to and feel a little let down...",1324252800,3,1792,4.73462783171521
3999442,5,B002VL5BWS,"To the point, DO NOT MISS THIS ""EXTENDED EDITION"" if you are interested in the Swedish film/TV production of Steig Larson's novel of the same name (or either of the other two productions in the series).  WHETHER OR NOT you have already seen the seriously truncated (shortened, mangled) version which was earlier released on DVD, BD, and streaming, THIS IS NOT TO BE MISSED.  Unlike the previously released version, this ""extended edition"" provides a coherent presentation.  Being one of the inexplicably over the top fans of anything connected with the three Larsen novels (or associated biographies, etc), I read all three novels early this year and then waited with bated breath for the ""movie"" versions.  I was seriously disappointed with all three earlier, shortened movie releases, and particularly the last two of the three in the series.  This was because new characters suddenly showed up on the screen without either sufficient introduction, or even identification.  Or there were very significant holes in the story line (in addition to those already extant in the novels!).

As many of you will know, the three novels were filmed for Swedish television, with one film for each of the three novels.  This disc presents one of the three films as originally formed and appearing on Swedish television - each film, including this one, was broken into two segments of approximately 90 minutes in length, for a movie lasting a total of 180 minutes.  When the Swedish TV version was presented in American theaters (and DVDs and BDs, the latter which I own), it was re-edited, and seriously shortened.  As far as I am concerned, this ruined all three original ""movie"" presentations.

Despite the fact that the productions were evidently produced for first showing on Swedish TV, the production values (both sight and sound) are certainly comparable to those of first rate American movies.  This reviewer does not know but strongly suspects that the producers had ultimate theater showing in mind when the films were made.

And finally, the Amazon's streamed version of the Extended Edition is free of notable artifacts on this reviewer's 109 inch Stewart Screen - in the streamed version the color balance and brightness are good - the black levels, interfered with by encoding and transmission noise, do not equal that of the BluRay disc, but are certainly acceptable.

The director and writer (script adaptation) have followed all three books satisfyingly.  They tightened up the plots, without loosing the characters.

And speaking of characters: Lizbeth Salander.  The writer of the trilogy deliberately sets up a character that we won't like, and perfectly casts Noomi in the roll.  She has multiple tattoos, body piercings, chain smokes, introverted, and hostile to the outside world.  In other words, she is a jerk that you would not invite to lunch.  No way are you going to sympathize or empathize with her.  That was the challenge the writer faced -- could he change our minds and make us like her?

Watch The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo first, then this one, and Hornet's Nest last.  Yeah, not only do you like her, you miss there not being a 4th film.  She is a franchise that could go on forever.  By the way, I bought the books after seeing the films.  I recommend this approach.

3999450,4,B002VL5BWS,"In the first installment of the ""Millenium trilogy"", the paths of goth hacker Lisbeth and whistle-blower journalist Mikael crossed, leading the two to solve an intriguing 40-year old mystery involving a toxic aristocratic family. In the second installment, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"", the focus is almost entirely on the monsters that make up Lisbeth's tragic past, and how they all seem to come together to create the central storyline. Lisbeth's past seems to be made up of a trilogy of monsters; all older men who used their positions of authority in order to abuse, violate, or silence her.

After going abroad for 18 months, Lisbeth is back in town to deal with the first of her trilogy of monsters, the Guardian who brutally raped her in the first film. Her Guardian has apparently hired someone to steal back the videotape Lisbeth made of the rape that she's been using to blackmail him into leaving her alone. Lisbeth confronts her Guardian using his own gun, which unfortunately later ends up being used in three murders, leaving Lisbeth the prime suspect and a wanted woman. Mikael becomes enmeshed in the story when a young reporter working for his paper, researching an article on the illegal sex trade industry, is murdered, and Lisbeth becomes the suspect. Mikael knows Lisbeth enough to know she's innocent, and works to not only try to clear Lisbeth's name but avenge the death of the young, idealistic reporter.

Two of the other trilogy of monsters from Lisbeth's past play central roles in the film as well; the second being the psychiatrist who abused her while she was illegally institutionalized as a child, and third, and most importantly, Lisbeth's father. Shown only in a brief flashback in the first film, when Lisbeth set him on fire at the age of 12, her father is apparently still alive, still horribly scarred physically by what Lisbeth did, and planning on killing her.

Much of the film has Lisbeth on the lamb, both hiding from the police and from her father's thugs, as well as trying to find evidence to clear her name. Lisbeth, the character, is most compelling when she's in full-on fighting bad-ass mode, and this film probably has the most action of any of the trilogy, especially featuring Lisbeth. As in the first film, Lisbeth is an incredibly compelling character (playing by a compelling actress); magnetic, charismatic, vulnerable and yet indomitable.

The film ends with plenty of loose ends, and once again, I find myself immediately wanting more. Now for ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" ...",1317600000,,2551,4.911832946635731
3999451,4,B002VL5BWS,"CUT TO THE CHASE
This is the original Swedish film, 2nd in the trilogy.  It is in English--you do not have to read subtitles (unless you want to). Of course, it is dubbed, but the dubbing is very well done.

EXTENDED TRILOGY
Note that there is an ""very extended edition"" of the trilogy available,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Tattoo-Trilogy-Extended-Edition/dp/B005JTLTI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition</a>&nbsp;Actually, it is the original ca 12-hour 6-part mini-series which was shown on Swedish TV with English subtitles (no English dubbing).  It contains more, and more graphic, sex scenes.  Because of the increased details, the series is far easier to follow that the movies.

DESCRIPTION
""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" is based on the second book of Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium Trilogy"", and does a good job of following the book. It is not a stand-alone movie.  The plot, such as it is, is not easy to follow even if you've read the book.  As is often the case with the middle book (or movie) in a trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"", is satisfying only in context with the first and the last book/movie.

The infamous ""rape scene"" is appears--but as perhaps 5 seconds of audio, and a 1 second scene that shows a woman's butt.  Otherwise, a total of three pairs of boobs make brief (measured in seconds) appearances, and may well be deleted from the US theatrical release.

THE STORY
Lisbeth Salander (an antisocial girl presumed suffering from Aspberger's Syndrome) is being hunted down by her half-brother for their father (a nasty former Soviet-spy father, Alexander Zalachenko).  She searches for him, finds him.  But she is shot and buried.

EVALUATION
Frankly, I do not think that this movie is as well made as the first and last.  Lisbeth seems older---too old for the part (That's true in all three movies, but perhaps her age is more noticeable in this slower movie).  Otherwise the acting is not quite as sharp as the first and last movie.  Most of the character development was done in the first movie, and is not expanded here. There is not much in the way of plot development, and little tension.  Nevertheless, ""Played with Fire"" is essential to the trilogy and can't be skipped.

This actually being a ""foreign"" movie is not a Hollywood product. That means that the characters far more closely resemble real human beings rather than the typical airbrushed Hollywood drones. The quality of the acting is superb. It is a story, superbly told (compared to many Hollywood products which are mostly sex and/or action with little plot). No explosions (but there is an impressive fire).  Just a great story.

SUGGESTION
Don't see the movie without seeing ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" first.  I suggest purchasing all three DVDs or the set.  View the movies as a Saturday or weekend marathon.  As the ""middle"" of a very long movie, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" will not be disappointing.
I suggest buying the DVDs, not the downloads--You'll want to see the trilogy again in a few years, or every few years.

3999463,1,B002VL5BWS,"Wow, words cannot describe how slow and boring the second part of this trilogy is. After the first movie I expected more of the same. What I got was an hour of slow-paced crime drama that made a huge crucial error. In the first movie the story revolved around the two main characters piecing together a puzzling disappearance of a third person. In this one one of the main characters becomes the suspect in a murder. It just doesn't work as so many things unbelievably do not make sense. Add to the fact that evil baddies are just not as compelling as the Vanger clan was in the first movie.

Onto the obviously stupid plot movements. First of all, it takes Lisbeth Salander over an hour to figure out to wear a blonde wig when she goes outside despite seeing WANTED posters or newspapers with her face front and center being accused of murder early on in the story.

Plus we have some gratuitous lesbian sex scene which after seeing the Tattoo DVD extra interview with Noomi Rapace (who played Lisbeth) who stated it was apparently shocking to Swedish society, is less than underwhelming as far as shock value. It's all soft-focus nonsense where (ooh, we see some nipples). Salacious boredom ensues.

Then we have this whole deal (SPOILER ALERT) where Lisbeth father is the whole criminal mastermind yet all he has all of just one bodyguard who is a parody of the Jaws character from the Moonraker Bond movie. When Lisbeth gets buried for dead and crawls out of her shallow grave, the movie lost me completely.

What worked in the first movie was replaced in this one with more violence and an unnecessary plot around trafficked women in Sweden of which we never actually see any. Hasn't the whole trafficking of women been done to death in other thrillers? If you're going to go that route, focus on the women so you can wring those emotions like you did in movie #1.

As many of you will know they shot all three movies basically over a period of a year and a half much like the Lord Of The Rings trilogy was shot. It shows as there are a few scenes repeated in this one. the most obvious is the shot of a train leaving ""downtown"" Stockholm crossing a bridge. It's the exact same shot as in the first movie.

I just felt it was lazy filmmaking based on lazy source material. The second book obviously is not as good or original as the first.

Also, zero DVD extras on this version of the release. Seems obviously rushed and suggests the movie was as well.",1313020800,5,2458,4.485458612975392
3999464,3,B002VL5BWS,"I read the book awhile back. In it, a character named Paulo Roberto, who is an ex-boxer, fights with a blond giant who can't feel pain. He almost wins. He certainly saves another minor character from a gruesome death. It's one of the true highlights of the book.

And one of the highlights of watching this movie is seeing the name ""Paulo Roberto"" in the credits, and realizing that he is a real person who plays himself, in a fictional role. Much like Dan Marino in Ace Ventura, but with substantially better acting. And his fight with the stoic Ronald Niedermann is probably the best action scene in a movie that could use a few more of them.

This movie takes a turn away from the self-contained serial killer story of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, and follows the adventures of societal mis-fit Elizabeth Salander, who is apparently connected on several levels to the darkest secrets of the Swedish government. Unfortunately, all three stories in the ""Millenium Trilogy"" have a bad habit of pretending to be about Salander, when they're really more focused on journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and whatever vast conspiracy he's threatening to unearth this week. Don't get me wrong, Blomkvist makes for a great protagonist (and is expertly acted by Michael Nyqvist), but Salander often gets relegated to the sidelines (she spends most of the movie hiding out as a murder suspect).

The movie tends to be more straightforward than the book. If you're a purist, you probably won't like that. Subplots are excised, and so are main plots. The central murders of the story are because of an illegal sex trade, but this is barely mentioned again, once we find out Salander's prints are on the gun.

The movie ends with a quasi-cliffhanger, as Salander tracks down her long-lost father, who is more or less not happy to be found. If you want all your loose ends neat and tidy, you'll have to watch part three (THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST).",1312934400,,1943,4.756676557863502
3999465,5,B002VL5BWS,"""The Girl Who Played with Fire,"" (2009) (129 minutes), is second in the Swedish film series based on the action-filled Millennium Trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson.  It is a violent, dark and suspenseful thriller, though it is not quite as intense or engrossing as the first in the series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/B003FBNJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>.  For one thing, it's got much less plot, and the pacing is rather leisurely, all things considered.

Computer maven Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) becomes the prime suspect in three murders, when her former guardian is killed, as well as two journalists, after Millennium magazine editor Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) launches an expos&eacute; of the Swedish sex trade.  Blomkvist, like his creator, has made his living exposing the corruption of the Swedish establishment.  So when a young journalist approaches him with a meticulously researched thesis about sex trafficking in Sweden, and those in high office who abuse underage girls, Blomkvist immediately throws himself into the investigation.  And the young journalist and his graduate student girlfriend are murdered.  The police find Lisbeth's fingerprints on the weapon; she is considered the prime suspect, and she must vanish as Blomkvist digs into a possible conspiracy.

It does sometimes seem that Lisbeth must have superhuman powers to survive the things she does: still, like the rest of us, she occasionally fuels up by inhaling the odd pizza.  And I wish I had a dollar for every movie I have sat through, silently screaming, while some inane heroine shrieks and cries as hero and villain fight to the finish.  I always want to yell at the woman on the screen, for heaven's sake, pick up that lamp and hit the guy on the head with it.  Lisbeth does, and then some.

Probably the best-known Swedish films before this series would have been those by world-famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergman&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ingmar-Bergman-Four-Masterworks-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000WC39FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ingmar Bergman: Four Masterworks: The Criterion Collection</a>.  The best-selling Swedish film before the release of this series was I AM CURIOUS (YELLOW).

Her toughness and vulnerability always seem to be present in her performance, and I simply could not stop rooting for her at every turn, every setback, and every triumph.

For a quirky, intense and sometimes harrowing suspense film series, this one is consistently excellent.

An observation: It seems that many American viewers prefer dubbed versions of foreign films. I prefer the subtitled versions so that the original actors' voices come through, and carry the intensity of their performance.

This is almost always true because the book has more details, greater characterization, psychological explorations, more depth, and additional sub-plots. Yet this film is filled with no-stop excitement, the acting is superb, and the scenery appropriate. While the film is in Swedish, I doubt that most people will find it hard to follow the subtitles.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and execution of the teams that put these together. The plots are tight, the acting and casting believable and the cinematography excellent. There was very Little wasted time and ""frames"", an excellent use of the media.

Some have compared this to the books of which I have no knowledge or experience. But I suspect they must be good as this movie weaves an unusual and twisted tail in a clear, exciting and spell binding manner.

If you enjoy modern mystery, sub-cultures, foreign locations and action with a plot that is not designed to sell toys to children this is up your alley.

Sub-Titles and Dubbing: Many films should be viewed in their original language as the dubbing is an afterthought. I am happy to report the dubbing on this movie is excellent and I feel that if you dislike sub titles (as my wife does) the dubbing does not interfere with the movie.

I hope you enjoy it, remember it is not for children...

3999472,3,B002VL5BWS,"You can see this film was destined for TV,The Girl Who Played With Fire-the 2nd part of Larsson's Millenium trilogy-it's flat,awful,dull,lacking tension,energy and pace. The story is less involving than the Tattoo film's. The 1st film had the novelty of Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth Salander:a girl with photographic memory,traumatic flashbacks,industrial clothing,piercings,computer wizardry,revengeful violence. Short of this novelty,there is a deadness in the cinematography,an indifference in the shooting,technological regression,despite the new director, Alfredson. Lisbeth is in danger,framed for 3 murders,on the run and forced to wreak more violence to clear hername. The murdered are Dag Svenson and girlfriend,doing a report on traffickin with a list of 29 clients and a published book,also Nils Bjurman,Lisbeth's legal guardian. Bjurman's gun was used and only Lisbeth's fingerprints were on it. Blomkvist wants to prove Lisbeth's innocence and complete Svenson's work. We get a gratuitious lesbian sex scene, for no real reason. Blomkvist tries to contact her via this friend(Miriam),living in Lisbeth's apartment. She is kidnapped by hired killers;boxer and mutual friend Paulo,who's following tries to rescue her. Both are knocked out by a nerveless,blond giant(Niederman),escaping from a burning warehouse. Scenes like this and the fact Lisbeth is only one step away from the police are not filmed with the necessary excitement. Also,the fact that Lisbeth's path and Blomkvist's don't cross. The blond giant looks like he's wandered in from a 70s Bond movie.

Lisbeth learns that the man behind the killings is known as `Zala'(Zalanchenko),a Russian defector. Lisbeth heads for his hideout in Gothenburg,where he meets the blond giant. Lisbeth as well as finding out more about her past from her police files(as well as Blomkvist),finds her father and half brother,in a climactic ending which seems implausible. This is an frittering away of a movie franchise in sporadic sadism,Google searches and archive rummaging,a mishmash of Nazis,corrupt police and lawyers,the draining of the enigma of Lisbeth into another abused girl victim.

The film starts with a nude woman living in a large house in the country. How can she afford it? She searches for ""Legal Services"". Tattoo removal? A man meets her lawyer Bjurman. ""I'll be in touch."" Lisbeth watches an apartment. She finds blank reports, and a revolver. 'Millennium' editor Mikael has a new story about the sex trade in Sweden. This crime has low priority in the Justice Ministry. [Could there be a payoff?] Lisbeth has been away for a year, traveling abroad. She offers her apartment to a girl friend. They are close friends. One source about the sex trade story has disappeared. Can he be tracked with a free cell phone? The report is about ready to be published now. Mikael goes to get the photographs, and finds these two reporters won't talk. ""It sounded like gunshots"" he was told. [Nobody called the police?] The police investigate. Who has a motive? Should they reveal their sources?

A man searches a rural cabin for something. The murder weapon was legal, registered to Bjurman. It has two fingerprints from Lisbeth! Her apartment is empty. Bjurman, the gun owner, is also dead! ""Trippel Mord"" says the headlines. Mikael believes Lisbeth is not guilty. Can anyone break into another person's computer and copy files? [Yes. Was it designed that way?] Miss Wu isn't reporter-friendly. ""Incompetent clowns""? Can fingerprints alone be proof of guilt? [They show a person was there, but not the time. Mikael visits a man. ""Is this a prank?"" Mikael offers him a chance to explain. Lisbeth attacks a man, he hangs around to answer her questions. He admits to smuggling amphetamines from Talinn. Then his teen-age daughter returns home. There is another man who believes in Lisbeth's innocence: her boxing trainer. [Weight class?]

A big blond man kidnaps Miss Wu (skills do not equalize weight class). A car chase for action. [No calls on the cell phone.] There is a fight in the shed. Will a fire destroy the evidence? No, they escape. The blond man had boxing training and felt no pain. One man talks to Mikael to keep his name secret. Zala was a gold mine of information. But he couldn't have done the murders. Elsewhere that big blond man makes a delivery. Two bikers ride to the Bjurman cabin just as Lisbeth is leaving. There is more action that makes the news. An old man tells Mikael a secret about Lisbeth. Can you believe it? A twelve-year old Lisbeth played with fire and was sent to a hospital.

The news on TV tells about the case, but leaves out some facts. Does Lisbeth's constant smoking symbolize self-destructive behavior? Lisbeth visits the car rental agency on business to learn about a license plate number. Lisbeth's house has the latest in security. Sending a letter to a Post Office box can identify the receiver. [Is he following too closely?] Mikael finds the records of Bjurman and the DVD. Can he help Lisbeth? Will Lisbeth get into deep trouble? Does she have an unknown relative? Is this all too unbelievable? Can help arrive to save Lisbeth? Will we see more ghastly action to shock the audience? The ending is ambiguous, another movie continues this story.

This is like a continuing series or soap opera. If Sweden is an ""anything goes"" society where is the scandal? If the sex trade profiteers from prostitution and pornography reported their income there shouldn't be a tax problem. This wasn't as shocking as the first movie. Isn't a large city a better hiding place than a country farm?",1301961600,,3485,4.772802653399668

Unfortunately having read the books, I find that the treatment given the material was highly superficial and barely following the plot of the excellent material it is based on.  The complexity of the plot in the book is not present in the movie, maybe because the producers and the director wanted to follow up on the success of the first movie they shortchanged the readers who would be the principal viewers of the films.

I am saddened that such a rich and enveloping story line was given such a nonchalant treatment to the point that it barely resembled the story line.

My only gripe is the condition of the disc itself. When I commenced to watch it, it showed a number of previews of upcoming movies. Which is fair enough I suppose. But what happened with this particular disc, was that it kept showing the previews over and over, repeatedly.
At first I thought the entire DVD was a faulty one filled with previews. It was not until I slowly trawled through the disc, and got to where the actual movie began. This is the very first time I have ever encountered this problem, and I have over 400 movies, collected through the years. I have always owned movies instead of renting them.
Which is why I love shopping at Amazon, and will continue to do so

3999505,2,B002VL5BWS,"I'll be honest here: I didn't expect much from a movie based on a book with pages devoted to long descriptions of IKEA furniture, Swedish coffee and computers, and so this movie didn't really disappoint in that field. So while we're still on positives, let's give Alfredsson a cookie for that... at least.

Played With Fire picks up maybe a year after the events in Dragon Tattoo. Basically, Lisbeth is rehabilitating from DT's events by lazing in a hotel in Grenada. She buys a gorgeous new apartment in Sweden and upon her return, hopes to start a new life as she moves in. She has not seen Mikael Blomkvist for a while, for some reason. On Blomkvist's side, he decides to take on an article on Sweden's sex slave trade. But things escalate when Nils Bjurmann, her guardian and two colleagues of Mikael's are found dead from apparent manslaughter. And it gets worse- Lisbeth's fingerprints are found on the gun. This calls Blomkvist to action as he is the only one who can clear her name.

This is the plot of what should be an exciting sequel to a film that set a new standard for quality in Foreign cinema. But the whole thing falls flat on its face from the first frame!!!!

For one, it looks different from the first frame. Any visual thought that the first film had is gone. The first film is one of the most visually enchanting of all time. A whole range of visual styles are used: gothic, cold/wintery, dark, sunny, etc. Whereeas it's easy to tell a new crew is in charge. The film loks and feels like something you'd see on afternoon television. Lazy camerawork and poor lighting can be seen here, and it takes 2 seconds to irk. Though this iand its follower were supposed to be TV productions, so it's no surprise.

Secondly, the script is a mess. For starters, how does Lisbeth know pretty much everyone in Stockholm? And how does everyone know each other. Another problem is that Lisbeth is too damn smart for her own good. I know this happened in DT, but it was part of how Blomkvist and Lisbeth solved things together. But she gets reduced to something of a Sue here with how oh-so-smart she is... on her own.

Oh, and there's a goon this time around, Niedermann. A film is only as good as its baddie, and what a stupid baddie he is. He basically is on the side of ""Throw Lizzy to the Spiders"", but he is dumb- we dunno if he even knows Lisbeth, and the only out for her towards the end. He's so goofy, at times, he even reminded me of Bane from Batman and Robin. Hell, at times I even thought he WAS Bane!!!!

On the plus side, the film has great performances from its cast. Nyqvist is great as usual and continues to impress as Blomkvist. I'm not even sure if Craig will have anything on him in Fincher's upcoming Dragon Tattoo prodiction. And of course, sexy Noomi Rapace. Who can go wrong with her? She's great. I admire her greatly- She was Lisbeth for a year and a half, and managed to not lose anyone around her. That is something to greatly admire. And she's even landed a role in a few Hollywood productions!

In short, PWF is a mediocre sequel and even weak as a standalone film. I could imagine Larsson diehards loving this, but for the rest of us, it just ain't good enough.",1300838400,3,3201,4.415254237288136

3999512,2,B002VL5BWS,"After viewing the first movie in this trilogy, I was really looking forward to the second installment, but oh was I disappointed. The changes in the story line for the first movie were minimal. However the changes in story line for the second movie made me think that the screen writer must have thought that he/she could write a better story/plot than Larsson. It is so chopped up and some events are in a different sequence than in the book. The plot is hard to follow even if you have read the books. There is just too much of the story left out.

The omission of the police storyline is a huge mistake. By not including the politically opportunistic DA, the woman/Lisbeth hating detectives, and the decent Bublanski along with their interaction with the female detective, it makes for a very lackluster police investigation. It is also an integral part of the book and Larsson's ongoing theme of violence and bigotry against women.

Rapace once again nails her character. I thought Nyqvist was a bit wooden; he lacked the emotion of the Blomkvist character who is desperately trying to find Lisbeth.

Perhaps it is also the change in director - Opley directed the first, Alfredson the second. The first movie has a cold quiet, but dangerous feel to it. This second film is sorely lacking when it comes to atmosphere. I keep coming back to choppy. I have a feeling that a lot of the movie lies on the floor after the film editor chopped it to pieces.

When a PhD candidate turns over her dissertation on sex trafficking in Sweden to Millenium Magazine, she and her husband are murdered, execution style.  Lisbeth Salander's fingerprints are on the gun and she becomes a fugitive.

Lisbeth has repurposed some of Wennerstrom's fortune and is now financially set.  It's a good thing, because she's definitely on the lam.  It's not just the police who are after her, either. As her past is revealed, it's clear that Lisbeth has made some deadly enemies.

The phrase heart in mouth aptly describes the final scenes of this movie.  It's brutal, violent and compelling.  One of the things that makes these movies so effective, is that the actors look real.  They're not the glossy, physically perfect characters we get from Hollywood and are so much more believable.  As always, the lovely landscapes and cityscapes of Sweden are the backdrop, and the entire experience is breathtaking and memorable.

This isn't a cozy feel-good movie, but it's dynamic cinema.  Noomi Rapace is superb, and the supporting actors are pretty wonderful, too.

3999519,3,B002VL5BWS,"Fire, the Movie

After reading the book, The Girl Who Played With Fire, I went onto Amazon Video On Demand and watched the Swedish adaptation of the book.  Let me tell you, this was in many ways quite a let-down.

Yes, when I see a movie after reading the book, I do expect some divergence from the original works.  I mean take a look at Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, two book to film adaptations that I felt were well-paced and captured the spirit of the author's intent.

However, ""Fire"" does not do that well.  Pretty much every single subplot was cut out of the film.  Literally!  I can understand cutting out the Caribbean scenes from the book, but none of the betrayal inside the police investigation was ever shown.  Nothing was explained about Salander's wealth nor why she suddenly got this huge 20 million Kroner house.

The choppy scenes and quick cuts and tight dialogue made for an extremely rushed first half.

The second half was better I think for a couple of reasons:  the second half honed closely to Larsson's rendition -- the hunt for Zala, the blonde giant's fight with Paolo, the lesbian understanding with Salander, etc., were nearly scene for scene from the book.  There were minor differences but nothing to quibble about.

The ending was quite different from the book.  Without giving away spoilers, unlike the book's ending, the police were efficient and the doctor's were forthright -- quite different!

Noomi Rapace as Salander and Michael Nygvist as journalist Blomkvist were excellent in reprising their roles.  I really missed the subplots of the editor's secret offer, the men-hating investigators who wanted to get at Salander, and the police chief Bublanski coming across as a dense cop rather than in the book as the only cop who knew what was going on.

The film was bare-bones of what the book breathed and lost what I felt was the heart of the book.  A few good scenes, a decent ending, rushed plot.  Average!

Can't wait for the American version!

The books were written with such a breadth of narrative, with such am innovative story line, that I doubted that it would translate to screen. I was wrong: in particular the portrayal of the lead character a young woman best described as a furious,indomitable, half mad young lioness of a girl who completely captivates the reader and sweeps you along on her incomprehensible crusade, which, in the end makes perfect sense and is beautifully resolved. Where? I wondered, could they find a young actress to bring this astonishing and novel character to life? They managed it wonderfully well. One of the best recent thrillers and transferred to screen brilliantly. Get all three in the series.",1296691200,4,914,4.865384615384615
3999522,3,B002VL5BWS,"I immensely enjoyed the trilogy of movies that include ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", ""The Girl who played with Fire"" and ""The Girl who kicked Hornest nests"".

Each movie is more than just a sequel to the next; each movie is a continuation from the preceding film, starting right from when and where the other one left off. Although, they are continuations, each film stands on their own and each film is completely different in tone, context, pacing and themes;

  ""Tattoo"" is a mystery,

  ""Fire"" is a revenge/action story and

  ""Hornet"" is a court room drama.

""Fire"" utilizes a different director from ""Tattoo"" and the different movie making style is quite apparent.

""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" is a mesmerizing mystery that is slow-paced yet, that same slow pace is effective in creating a very stirring drama. Although sometimes tending to be melodramatic, there are historical motifs involving Nazism, incest and misogyny that create the excuisite framework of this unsettling yet excellent movie. The film does not rely on action since the plot, mystery, character development and revelations/lack of predictibility contribute to it's excellence. The Girl Who played with Fire"" does nearly not have the ingredients that make 'Tattoo"" such a compelling movie.

Without creating an unneccessary spolier alert, ""The Girl who played with Fire"" provides an explanation as to the origins of the heroine, Lisbeth, how she deals with it and how ""it"" deals with her. Since she assisted him in his woes on the previous movie, journalist Blomkvist now helps Lisbeth with her own woes. The story is interesting, it operates at a faster pace than ""Tattoo"" and it acts as a very satisfying sequel to the preceding film. A new character is introduced that takes this series from a realistic movie and practically take sit to ""James Bond"" level. The villainous character is fascinating yet wholly inconsistent to the villains from the first film.

It's not that there is anything wrong with this movie, in fact, this overly-European approach to the action/mystery genre will act as fresh approach when compared to the usual Hollywood dreck. The only problem, if you want to call it that, is that the movie is different, and therefore inferior to ""Tattoo"". It does not have the unexpected plot twists, eerie atmosphere, or emotional power that it's predecessor has. ""Fire"" lacks the originality of the first one and, consequently, lacks the impact of ""Tattoo"".

It would be pretty much impossible to have an interest in ""Fire and enjoy this movie without first viewing ""Tattoo"". If you watched the first two movies, then it is inevitable that you already have or planning on seeing ""Hornet"" which concludes the trilogy. Although it is not as good as ""Tattoo"", ""Hornet"" is a very satisfactory conclusion to the ongoing story.

I would rate ""Tattoo"" the best, followed by ""Hornet"" and then ""Fire"".",1296518400,5,2896,5.039832285115304

3999531,5,B002VL5BWS,"Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist return in 2009's thrilling followup to the critically-acclaimed THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO! After returning home to Stockholm, Lisbeth Salander learns that she has been implicated in the murder of two journalists who were just days away from releasing a shocking expose on human trafficking in Millennium magazine. Mikael Blomkvist, her only friend and colleague, attempts to locate her and clear her name with the help of the police, but they are caught in a race against time as the secret agency behind the sex trade operation closes in on her themselves. THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is a surprising change in pace from the timely-relayed mystery found in the previous film. Daniel Alfredson drives a heightened tension as each of the people closest to Lisbeth fall into the hands of her enemies while she continues to elude capture. Lisbeth proves to be just as intelligent and resourceful as before, only this time, she must wage an all-out war against those that seek to harm her. Although this entry is not nearly as sexually explicit, Alfredson is never afraid to use graphic violence during the brutal action sequences. FIRE answers many of the burning questions surrounding Lisbeth's mysterious past, drawing out shocking family secrets that become integral to the plot. Unfortunately, the details behind the human trafficking subplot seem to be forgotten as the film wears on. Rapace and Nyqvist also share very little screen time, and their unique relationship is greatly missed. Despite a few minor oversights, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is still a riveting success that continues to build on Larsson's brilliant characters and masterful suspense.

Not for adolescents or young instant-grads, the books and films are for adults who like complex, multi-charactered stories where it's hard to keep things straight.

Taking over from the highly untalented Niels Arden Oplev, new director Daniel Alfredson plays it safe and removes most of the unpleasant sadism-masquerading-as-feminism that characterized ""Dragon Tattoo."" For example, there is another scene where Lisbeth Salander breaks into some unsavoury character's house, ties him up, and threatens to kill him if he doesn't comply with her demands. Only this time, she doesn't even forcibly sodomize and disfigure him! Why, it's almost family-friendly! Fortunately, she does find time for the line, ""you're a sadistic pig and a rapist, aren't you?"" I do hope that this becomes a popular catch-phrase.

Seriously, though, the second movie avoids the major idiocies from the first. Salander no longer jumps to reward sensitive journalist Mikael Blomkvist with sex just for being sensitive. There are more good male characters aside from just Blomkvist (one of them with an old-fashioned penchant for rescuing damsels in distress). There is also more effort to create a detective story, with investigations, clue-gathering and so forth, rather than relying on magical computer wizardry. Some good characters go so far as to criticize Salander's antisocial inclinations, suggesting that she is overly selfish. Blomkvist now emphasizes the importance of letting a suspected criminal have his say, as opposed to hounding him until he commits suicide.

So, let's applaud Alfredson for a huge improvement over the first movie. Nonetheless, we should ask for more than minimal competence. This is still a very formulaic story. Even without the major idiocies, there are enough minor ones. As is common in action movies, the villains are dumb as rocks. The big silent goon beats up two good characters in an abandoned barn (although one of them pulls off some totally awesome roundhouse kicks with her hands tied behind her back), then decides to kill them. But instead of doing this the easy way (another guy earlier even warns about the ease with which he breaks people's necks), he goes to the trouble of hauling a full canister of gasoline, pouring it around the perimeter of the barn, then lighting it on fire, while the camera comically pans to his victims escaping out the back door on the other side. There's a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes/dp/B0000AYJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes</a>&nbsp;quality there.

Then, Blomkvist discovers the identity of the villain, by essentially blackmailing a crooked officer of the ""Secret Police."" (Cue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homer-Simpson/dp/B000JLQPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homer Simpson</a>: ""What the hell is that? Some kind of secret police?"") The way he gets this guy -- a seasoned secret agent, mind you, who has reasons to lie low -- to come out of hiding and reveal his address is...by sending him junk e-mail claiming that he won a cell phone in a lottery. You're saying people actually respond to those? What, you can't even buy a smartphone on a Secret Police salary?

Who is our villain this time around? A ruthless Russian gangster, mastermind of sexual trafficking. A Nazi psychopath would have been slightly more stereotypical, but of course, a Nazi psychopath was already the villain in ""Dragon Tattoo."" Naturally, this Russian gangster is an old KGB hand (of course, his murderous rampage couldn't possibly be born of the social catastrophe of the 1990s, heavens no, la la la we're not listening), as well as a wild man who murdered his colleagues, because of course there's nothing remotely like discipline in the KGB. His only motivation appears to be his innate savagery. But let's be fair -- the movie does briefly touch on an interesting idea, that the gangster enjoys the full protection and patronage of the Swedish government, which apparently decided that his political usefulness outweighed his criminal tendencies. This is not developed much, but perhaps the third movie will get into that. Aim high, young Alfredson!

The sexual trafficking provides the premise for the movie, but oddly enough receives little real attention. The first movie really played up the terror of the killer's victims, showing a long montage of their disfigured faces. I am glad to have avoided a second round of this, but it is a strange about-face. A brave young journalist investigates sexual trafficking together with his socially conscious girlfriend, and it gets them killed...but up until then, their investigation comes off as being part of their courtship ritual. The title of the girl's fearless expose is, wait for it, ""From Russia With Love."" Granted, every monograph in the social sciences has a lurid title, followed by a more sensible subtitle. But still, this is supposed to be a work that shocks the Swedish public and forces them to feel the plight of these exploited, voiceless women. To name such a thing after Cold-War-era hackery is at best clueless, at worst callous. The lad's only reaction to this is, ""wow, my beautiful girlfriend published a book all by herself!"" I suppose this is meant to show how they were too naive to know what they were getting into, but still, an odd lack of compassion wafts in the air.

Perhaps it's for the best. Something tells me I can go without Stieg Larsson's social commentary, so this movie might as well focus on the personal angle. To that end, we get a big revelation straight out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Empire-Strikes-Back/dp/B000FQJAJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Empire Strikes Back</a>. As in ""Dragon Tattoo,"" Lisbeth acts sort of edgy and outside the law, but since she never quite succeeds in killing anybody (even in self-defense), it's still not quite enough for the movie's audience to face a moral dilemma. Oh, and her evil court-appointed guardian from ""Dragon Tattoo"" ends up being even more evil than previously shown, just to make doubly sure that he deserved what he got in the first movie.

No, really, this movie is a lot better than ""Dragon Tattoo,"" with a lot of the unpleasantness sanded out. Alas, I can still think of no good reasons to watch it, much less pay money for the privilege.",1293062400,,6473,5.479959919839679

3999579,3,B002VL5BWS,"""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is the transitional second installment in a trilogy that began with ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"".

Like the proverbial middle-child, it suffers from comparison with a brilliant first-born.  The first was a much better paced and visually interesting film with many interesting elements, plots, and subplots well integrated into a whole.  But this movie is far more conventional, reverting to the well-known formula of an espionage movie.

True, the heroine is a change from the James Bond and Clint Eastwood (Man With No Name) male versions of the loner/good guy/avenger... but in removing some of the focus from Lisbeth Salander this movie nearly peripheralizes her, and makes her more confusing than intriguing.  By subjecting her to humiliation to the point of making her a Christlike figure, the film comes to resemble ""Rambo"" and ""Billy Jack"" more than it does Tarentino.

The end result is a movie that keeps your attention enough to anticipate the final Part III, not out of joyful anticipation but merely a weary hope that all the loose ends may be tied together and a plausible conclusion offered.

Fast paced with intricate details of the many important characters and events that all diverged in the end.  Because I loved the book, I was anxious to see the movie.  The movie was a disappointment.  So much was left out, that I think if I hadn't read the book I would've been lost.  It was fast paced, but almost too fast, without much character/background depth.

I am not easily impressed with this type of movie or book...but this author was brilliant! (He will be missed)

I read the last of the trilogy ""The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" because it was recommended by a reader's group at a local library. I had never read a Swedish author before and half of my interest was held by the description of a different place in the world.
The story was riveting. The differences of Swedish and USA laws was interesting.
The action and suspense was awesome.
Everything about this story was a surprise.
I agree with all the reviewers with more than 4 stars!

Noomi Rapace reprises her powerful and brilliant portrayal of the Lisbeth Salander (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) character - giving both a harrowing and poignant portrayal of a uniquely conceived role.

3999633,4,B002VL5BWS,"This might be one of those rare instances when the film actually improves on the book. It's a given that any film version of this lengthy book (600+ pages) would have to cut large chunks of the story--and screenwriter Jonas Frykberg, who adapted Stieg Larsson's novel, has trimmed the story perfectly, resulting in a film version that dispenses with many of the superfluous (and--let's be honest--tedious) portions of the novel. We're left with all of the meat and none of the fat. The plot unfolds methodically but not slowly, the action scenes are exciting and comprehensible (Hollywood could learn something from the director of this film--it's possible to stage action scenes without an interminable amount of cuts and camera swoops that render the action unintelligible), and the performances are top-notch. After watching this movie, I still cannot understand why Hollywood feels the need to remake these films. The Swedish setting and locales, not to mention the political backdrop of Lisbeth Salander's family's past and the integral role it plays in the plot, are integral to the story--relocating the action to America will greatly diminish the power of these stories. Furthermore, so much of Noomi Rapace's portrayal of Lisbeth is conveyed non-verbally, and her silences are pretty much her most eloquent bits of dialogue.

That said, this is a thrilling and engrossing drama that puts Noomi Rapace in its dramatic center as computer hacker and social misfit Lisbeth Salander, who is victimized by government forces that would like nothing better than to bury her once and for all. She becomes the subject of a manhunt as chief suspect in several murders, and only estranged friend and investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist seems capable of helping her survive.

3999653,3,B002VL5BWS,"Given the enormous success of the books and generally good reviews for a successful first film installment, it is baffling that the second film proves to be so formulaic that even with a very high violence quotient it is often simply boring.  Some problems are mechanical and inexplicable. Why, given the value of this franchise, is the English dubbing so utterly horrible? Few of the voiceovers are even close to acceptable, and for long stretches the effect is close to those old Japanese monster movies where dialogue sounds like it's being done by a first-time reader eager to get to lunch. It sounds as though they're not really even trying here, and when a convincing job is done, as with some of the minor parts, it only makes the main characters sound even flatter and more lobotomized. The other fundamental problem (in my opinion) is a combination of editing and direction that in some scenes drags on excessively and meaninglessly, as though the goal is simply to fill more screen minutes. The pacing of the book's narrative is, of course, excellent, but the film often drags. These two basic flaws drag everything down. Other puzzling features include the decision to have Lisbeth chain-smoke through the entire film. Unless she's getting beaten to near-death or the like, she's smoking. The director's and actor's goals seem to be to include as many uglifying elements as possible everywhere -- which is not the case with the books, and that's important -- and as a viewer I wish the direction and art direction had not been such an unrelenting choice for unwavering ugliness. As a written character, Lisbeth has elements of great appeal, but other than heroism, bravery, and those basics, both the direction and the acting fail to add other dimensions in the film. I'm sure the dubbing hurts here. There are remarkable accomplishments in this version, I think, but they are almost entirely of the dark and horrifying sort: an ability to convey physical brutality; an ability to convincingly portray malevolence; the ability to make just about every single character (including the ""good"" ones) at least slightly bestial, at least in appearance; true shock; etc. Some negative reactions may result from the ""middle"" position of this film, which from a narrative level lacks sufficient self-containment and in many respects simply moves from event to event rather than really pursuing a strong, linear question, quest, etc. For such a violent piece, I found it surprisingly uninteresting. I hope that the final installment will at least offer decent dubbing and editing. As for the other matters that disappointed me, I hope I am in the minority and that others enjoyed it more. To me, a really exciting novel with engaging characters came across here as a lot of intermittent bloody action with little character development or genuine interest.",1290211200,,2857,5.027426160337553

3999655,4,B002VL5BWS,"The Swedish-made, English sub-titled, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" directed by Daniel Alfredson, is the slick sequel to ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" Both were based on a trilogy of novels by Stieg Larsson entitled ""The Millennium Trilogy."" The third and final novel, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" was released in America this week. It should be available on DVD in a few months.

 Larsson, a former newspaper journalist died in 2004 at the age of 50 from an apparent heart attack. He left behind manuscripts of three completed but unpublished novels in a series. He wrote them for his own pleasure, and made no attempt to have them published until shortly before his death. The novels were finally released after he died and ""The Millennium Trilogy"" became one of the most popular novel series of all time. After he died, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world in 2008, behind only Khaled Hosseini. By March 2010, his ""Millennium Trilogy"" had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.

 ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" takes place a year after the end of ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."" Lisbeth Salander, again played with gusto by Noomi Rapace, went on a long trip to places as far away as Australia, and when she returned, she found herself wrongly accused of three murders. Her sidekick from the first movie, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, again played by Michael Nyquist, believes she is innocent, and embarks on a mission to prover just that.

 The movie opens with a young journalist couple approaching Blomkvist and his magazine ""Millennium"" about a well-fleshed out story they had been researching about a Swedish slave-trade sex ring. The magazine hires them, but before they can complete and publish the story, Blomkvist find them both shot to death in their apartment. A gun is left behind at the scene with Lisbeth's fingerprints on it.

 Soon after, Lisbeth's slime guardian Nils Bjurman, who had vicious raped Lisbeth in the first movie, turns up dead too. When the police find his body, the see the words tattooed to his stomach, announcing the the world that he is a ""sadistic, rapist pig."" They also find a video showing him raping Lisbeth, so putting two and two together in Swedish, the come up with Lisbeth as his murderer too. They are only half right, since in the first movie, we see the rape scene, and we also see Lisbeth branding the creep with a hot poker. But kill him? Well no. She had her chances and was content with his branding as her revenge.

 The rest of the movie is Blomkvist trying to clear Lisbeth's name, and Lisbeth, doing the same on her own, with no contact with Blomkvist whatsoever. In fact, they don't actually meet until the movie is almost over.

 Some people may be offended by a hot lesbian scene between Lisbeth and her half-Asian lover, but it lasts only a few fleeting seconds. It is not a gratuitous scene and it does add to the plot, cementing the relationship between the two. It helps the viewers understand why Lisbeth's lover would put her life in danger (catching a brutal beating to boot, which lands her disfigured in the hospital), to help Blomkvist clear Lisbeth's name.

 ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" did not garner the critical acclaim of ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" mainly because the first movie was such a hard act to follow.

 Matthew Toomey of ABC Radio Brisbane opined, ""Whilst it's not as memorable as the original, I've always got time for a well-written thriller. There are plenty of characters involved and you'll be cheering (on the inside) for Blomkvist as he fits the pieces of the puzzle together. He's such a likable hero with his mild-mannered demeanor.""

 Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat Gazette didn't feel his movie measured up to the first. He wrote, ""Like the first film, there is a lot of enjoyable art (and artiness) applied to what is essentially a pulp fiction. The villains are Bond-film cartoonish, and it was more fun to see Mikael and Lisbeth work together in the first movie than it is to watch them slowly converge in this one.""

 I was caught somewhere in between. While I thought ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was brilliantly done, I enjoyed the taut suspense in ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" with almost the same vigor.

 The plots are decidedly different, but the spirit of the two lead characters, Lisbeth and Blomkvist, are captivatingly the same. If you liked the first movie, you'll like the sequel. Simple as that. I can't wait to see the third Millennium installment on DVD, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" in a few short months.

 Out of a possible five stars (which I gave ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""). I give ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" a solid 4  stars. The half-a-star less is a reflexion, not on the sequel, but rather because ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was such an exceptional movie.

The Girl Who Played with Fire (2009) is the second film in the Millennium trilogy that centers on the chief editor of Millennium Magazine, investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist, and the lonely, dark, antisocial computer genius - hacker of the highest class, the young woman named Lisbeth Salander. In my review on the first film in the series, I wrote, ""Stieg Larsson stated that the main source of inspiration in creating the character of Lisbeth was Sweden's most beloved heroine of children literature, Pippi Long Stocking by Astrid Lindgren. I would add, Pippi the survivor of nightmarish horrible childhood, Pippi the fighter of the men who hated women ... I have not read the books yet but I most certainly will and I will be waiting for the rest of the movies' release. I am intrigued by Lisbeth's dark sides as much as her brilliant intellect, her personality, and determination to fight evil and abuse against women. She is the best part of the film and I want to learn more about her."" The Girl Who Played with Fire reveals some gruesome details from Lisbeth's childhood and adolescence and uncovers some shocking family secrets. The identity of the man in the car from Lisbeth' recurring nightmares is no mystery anymore after the film is over. We learn the details of her past that more than explain the peculiarities of her character and some of her life preferences. After ten minutes into this film, Lisbeth who returned to Stockholm after an assignment that took her to the places as far from Sweden as Australia, New Zealand, and Caribbean, finds herself wanted by the police for the triple murder with the evidences that with all certainty point at her direction and make her the most obvious suspect. Two of the victims are the young journalist who worked for the Millennium magazine on the expose regarding Russian-Sweden sex trafficking which implicates many high rank government officials and respectable businessmen, and his girlfriend who just finished the doctorate on the same subject. The third victim is Lisbeth' former sadistic pervert legal guardian, Nils Bjurman. Mikael is the only one who believes in her innocence, but he does not know how to contact Lisbeth whose life is in danger because the real murderer stops at nothing to find her.

The second film in the trilogy is a well-made crime/thriller/mystery that rises above average thanks to very good acting from Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist as Lisbeth and Blomkvist as well as from the actors playing new characters in the life of the girl who was not afraid to play with fire. As often is the case, and as many of the reviewers have stated already, the film suffers from middle-of-the-trilogy syndrome leaving the ending rushed and abrupt and some of the scenes in the final part totally implausible. The film has so many turns in the plot that it is not always easy to follow and not to get lost. Even with these problems, The Girl Who Played with Fire is good and interesting film especially when intense, resourceful and very determined Lisbeth Salander is on the screen. Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is the perfect casting, and she completely disappears in the character. It is even more incredible considering how much Noomi differs from Lisbeth in reality. Rapace is feminine, smiling and charming - a complete opposite to living under the burden of a terrible past Lisbeth Salander. I found Lisbeth one of most interesting and fascinating movie characters I've seen on screen lately and I am sure that even after watching the last film in the series and learning more about her past, I'll be reading the books with interest. Even after two films, Lisbeth is still a mystery for me, and as good as the films are, I'd like to read the whole story of the Girl that was not afraid to fight men who hated, abused and humiliated women.",1289865600,,3868,4.832579185520362
3999660,5,B002VL5BWS,"Larsson's books gave us some bizarre twists and wonderful, indelible characters.  I have read the first two, seen the first two, and am anxious for the third of the series.  Nonetheless, while Stieg's story-lines do captivate, I always thought he was in desperate need of a good editor.  I am amazed at the Swedish paring down of the novels into film, and I salute them for their spare and precise ""getting to the story, without playing around"" abilities.  But indeed, Larsson did ramble, mumble, and stumble about.  In this particular novel, of note are the first 100 pages or so (the entire Caribbean episode), which then went on to have NOTHING to do with the rest of the story! -- unless it appears in the third installment.  And all that stuff about Lisbeth and her mathematical fascinations... came to what???  I was knocked over that it all went nowhere.  At least, not here -- and created some extraneous reading, to put it mildly.  As well, the book was overloaded with this cop and that reporter, etc. doing so many extra things that never came to anything; even having sudden and startling changes of attitudes towards the main characters, that I was well stymied as to why half of it all had been included.

But the tale is such, that once you get into Larsson, faults and all, he has far and away created a fascinating tour into another world, and we are hooked. And we should not fail to give the filmmakers great credit, they managed to whittle things down to the bare basics, and still give you a roaring good story.  (I do hope the American version might fluff some things and edges out more; but I am worried.)  Surely the Swedes have presented us with two marvelous characters perfectly cast and played to a T -- I know Craig will be good, but this version and the people in it are absolutely sterling!!  And I was so gripped by the range of Noomi Rapace's controlled and yet very revelatory portrayal of a difficult role... that I think she deserves an Oscar on this one.  She was utterly outstanding.  And without her, there would have been no film!!  Her acting accomplishment deserves notice.",1289865600,,2115,4.614973262032086

Stig can write entire chapters on electronic equipment and computer components, stuff that just doesn't move the story along where the movie editor can bypass all that with a simple sentence.

In this movie Lisbett is wrongly suspected in a triple homicide. Her old bud Blomkvist figures as much and the two, separately, try to get to the bottom of things.

This falls short of ""Tattoo"" on two ends. First is the script. This is a bit slower, not as dense and a bit clunkier than the first. It has a lot of the same elements but here it just seems more leaden. Then there is the directing. This just isn't as smooth and stylish as ""Tattoo."" I hate to use the word hack but, where I was enthralled with ""Tattoo,"" this just struck me as being more routine.

This is not at all a bad watch, and I'm more inclined toward three and a half stars as opposed to three, but fans beware, as good as it is, it isn't quite the level of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.""",1289520000,2,1029,4.109452736318408

3999665,4,B002VL5BWS,"THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is the second installment of Stieg Larssen's Trilogy brought to film. Larssen, who witnessed a gang rape as a child, grew up with an antipathy of violence toward women, and that antipathy drove him to write the books, which were published posthumously, after his premature death.

Noomi Rapace returns as Goth Girl Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo. Michael Nyqvist returns as investigative journalist Mikael Blomqvist, her friend, ally, and sometime lover.

As the story opens, two of Blomqvist's colleagues are slain while working on a piece about sex trafficking; when Lisbeth's Guardian is next found dead, official suspicion falls on her for the three murders. Lisbeth sets out to unravel the mystery of these murders. Blomqvist is once again her ally. In the course of investigating the murders Lisbeth makes some unpleasant discoveries about her own mysterious childhood.

While the performances in THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE are easily on a par with those in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, the latter film had a byzantine plotline, a deeply noir atmosphere, and an intense outre quality rarely seen in commercial films. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO haunts the viewer. THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE lacks the same intensity. This murder mystery is much closer to the cinematic mainstream. The relationships between the characters seem more contrived than in the first film. The relationship between Lisbeth and Blomqvist, so central to the first film, is glossed over in the second. The two films have different Directors, so that may be a major contributing factor to the difference in the two productions.

A less memorable sequel, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is still the bridge to THE GIRL WHO KICKED A HORNET'S NEST, the third (and final) installment.

3999672,4,B002VL5BWS,"THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE plays with our patience a bit.  The first installment of this trilogy was far more linear and defined the characters more clearly, and perhaps that is what the director Daniel Alfredson was depending on as he made this part 2 - that the audience had all of the character drivers in mind and didn't need to clarify.  But part two has two stories that run parallel and finally intersect: the journalists for Millenium magazine (including Mikael Blomkvist played by  Michael Nyquist) are exploring sex trafficking when two of their star reporters are murdered.  As they interview pimps and johns they hear the recurring name of 'Zala'.  This leads to the suggestion that Lisbeth Salander (again the spooky and daring Noomi Repace) is the chief suspect.  Lisbeth hides her identity and with reassurance that Mikael believes her innocence sets out to find the major criminal Zala.  This opens some flashbacks to her past (the subject of which is suggested in the title) and with the help of Mikael she is able to find the Zala character - and make some discoveries about her childhood and relations that are startling indeed.

Rapace is strong once again and unafraid to do some rather tough scenes that further define her character.  We know her a bit better, but she does seem to be a secondary story here.  The pace of the film is such that much of the action is confusing (fire and gore and torture are fine but they need context to justify their presence), and the names of characters go flying past almost as often as they are killed.  But for those who love violence and terror this film has both.  Cinematography is by Peter Mokrosinski and the musical score (thunderously loud..) is by Jacob Groth. Now let's see how they adapt the last novel in the trilogy to bring this all together tightly.  In Swedish with English subtitles. Grady Harp, October 10",1288483200,,1886,4.730886850152905
3999683,2,B002VL5BWS,"My biggest problem with the Swedish adaptations of Stieg Larrson's Millennium trilogy is that for someone who hasn't read the three books, these movies must seem like an incomprehensible messes. The novels are so heavy with intricate plot and character development (it should be noted that almost ALL of the police procedural sub plot of the second novel is just erased from the story, Bublanski is on screen for about 1 minute) that it would be impossible to impart all of that to the screen. But with this original trilogy, especially the second film, plot and character are delivered so quickly and with mere explanation, that you have to already know whats going to happen, or you will be totally lost. ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" is, technically, much slicker and better made; director Daniel Alfredson has a much better handle on pacing his picture than Niels Arden Oplev did with ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""- there really is no dull moment. Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are both still decent in the roles. Rapace looses some of the steam from Part 1 while Nyqvist becomes less goofy, but both just don't bring the spark the characters had on the page to screen. Still, ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" moves quickly, does a fairly okay job of condensing the material (that they actually decided to include) in the book and looks great visually, but one wishes that the screenplay would have taken a bit more time relaying the information in a more concise and clear manner.

3999685,5,B002VL5BWS,"The second section of a trilogy is usually the most unsatisfying. The loose ends of the first installment, in this case the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-with-the-Dragon-Tattoo-Blu-ray/dp/B003T6LIBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [Blu-ray</a>] are mostly tied up, but by the second part the larger theme, in this case misogyny, is opened up and awaits resolution in the final episode.

In this work we realize that ""the Girl"" is far more than just a supporting character in a journalist's investigation of a family mystery. The girl is Lisbeth Salander, brilliant, sneaky, sexually ambiguous, and brave. She is both the victim of unspeakable crimes and the avenger of those crimes. The original title of the manuscripts for all three novels was ""Men Who Hate Women"". In that context we see that Salander is everywoman, at least every woman who has ever been treated unjustly by men. The form of that injustice can be physical, economic, sexual, or judicial. Salander is victimized by all four her tale careens wildly as she addresses each persecution with steely determination.

Noomi Rapace is brilliant as the girl. It is difficult to imagine how Hollywood who has started filming its own version of the trilogy can find an actress so perfectly suited for the role, one which requires edginess, youth, and total believability. Mikael Blomkvist (moodily played by Michael Nyqvist) is still around, but he is no longer at the center of the storm.

The sexual violence of the first installment is abated. This will make it an easier view than the disturbing scenes in part one for some. However, the violence was not gratuitous, and certainly not salacious. It plays a critical role in the plot and the development of what is to come. For those who can't stand subtitles, the DVD has a dubbed English track. Personally I was so captured by this film, that the subtitles were not a distraction. One of the big complaints about the novels has been that Stieg Larrson used too much exposition and not enough dialog to move the plot. That spareness of words has transferred well to the screen.

Finally this movie is gorgeous in Blu-ray. The crisp Swedish winter has dissolved into a glorious spring. It is the perfect setting for Salander's rebirth as an avenging angel.",1288310400,6,2355,5.205804749340369
3999686,5,B002VL5BWS,"The Girl Who Played with fire picked up where The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo left off. It has al the story elements that we saw in the first movie, from the tattoo she left a rather unfirendly gentleman with to the other pieces of a puzzle that makes her a very unique chacter. Time has passed and with that passing some things have happened. Still, the world is one that any fan of the first movie will recognize. What's more is that this movie digs in deeper, exploring the life that we looked at a little while taking it and pulling it further into view.

For people who did not see the first movie, I would not recommend reading anything that is said from here on. For those who did, welcome to the fold and another chapter. Here, we find out what happened after she left her reporter sitting there and waiting and we find out what she has been up to. We also find out what some other forces have been up to, and those forces are rather ugly. For one thing, they have been keeping tabs on our lady. For another, they want her out of the picture. So, when some ominous events happen, guess who gets the roundhouse to the proverbial chin?

If you enjoyed the last movie, you should enjoy this one. True, the story is not as in-depth as the last one, but it is still a deep and complex enigma that is fun to sort out. The acting is up to par as well, and new faces enter the fold. For people worrying about anything like recasting, worry not. Everyone is back and ready for action. That's good, too, because they really make the story what it should be - interesting.

When you watch this, you have to keep up just as much as the last movie. The thing is that this is not so removed from the characters. Here, the problem is following the ""girl"" closely and it is something that is terribly familiar. It deals with her past and, in that, it is great. I want to say a lot more but, in saying it, I'm afriad of spoiler. So, I'll say that this was not the last movie but that it was good. It took and had life of its own, making it stand up and attract me to it.

I would rank it almost as well as the first movie, but not quuite as good. It would be really hard to top that one because, to me, it seemed epic. Still, it shouldn't be missed.",1288224000,,2240,4.1307339449541285
3999687,4,B002VL5BWS,"I liked the second Millennium novel better than the first, but the film of the first novel is more satisfying than the film version of the second.  The reason is simple: the first book is far more atmospheric, the second more plot-driven and film is a visual medium.  In TGWPWF an investigative journalist and his graduate student girlfriend are working on a project concerning coerced sex workers in Sweden.  They take the project to Millennium; Millennium likes it and agrees to publish; suddenly the journalist and his girlfriend are found murdered.  The gun used is that of Lisbeth's current 'guardian' and it has her fingerprints on it.  Lisbeth investigates independently, while dodging the law; Blomkvist does what he can to stay in contact with her and watch her back.  The figure behind the killings and his blond monster assassin/servant are related to Lisbeth in ways that stretch plausibility.  Lisbeth gives a good account of herself against both overwhelming and weird antagonists.

The good news is that there is more of Lisbeth in the film than in the book, though her relationship with Blomkvist is now so attentuated as to be a lost opportunity.  The plot is a bit clunky and the ending somewhat less satisfying than that of TGWTDT.  That is not to suggest that you shouldn't see the movie.  You should.  It's very good.  Not superb, but very good.  The setting serves fewer purposes here and the focus is on the action.

3999689,4,B002VL5BWS,"The late Stieg Larsson centered his Millennium Trilogy around cruelty towards women -- and the movie adaptations don't hold back either.

The second movie of the trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" is a tightly wound thriller that is almost as good as the first. It lacks some of the raw, wild, dark energy, but it tangles together some razor-sharp social commentary (sex trafficking) with car chases and conspiracies. Best of all, it still has brilliant performances by Michael Nyqvist and Noome Rapace.

A year after ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" Millennium magazine has a new reporter -- Dag Svensson (Hans Christian Thulin) and his girlfriend are doing reports on sex trafficking and prostitution. But then Mikael (Nyqvist) finds both of them dead in their apartment, and Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson) -- the cruel ""guardian"" who raped Lisbeth -- has been brutally shot in the head.

Since Lisbeth (Rapace) just returned to Stockholm (and threatened to shoot Bjurman), she becomes the No. 1 suspect in all three murders. Even though, y'know, she had no motive for two of them.

Of course, Mikael doesn't believe that she did it -- especially since a hostile blond giant is going around beating up anyone (a trainer, a casual girlfriend) who might know Lisbeth's whereabouts. As Lisbeth goes on her own dark mission, she tells Mikael that he should look for someone named ""Zala."" But when Mikael starts hunting for information on this mystery man, he also learns more about Lisbeth's dark past...

Lisbeth Salander was something of a mystery in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" -- we knew she was troubled, a brilliant hacker, and had been in a psych ward. But ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" rips away all that mystery and shows us where Lisbeth Salander came from, and how she became a lonely, punky avenging angel. It's pretty nasty, and it ends on a cliffhanger (for crying out loud!).

The biggest problem with this story is that it lacks the raw, primal energy that made the first movie so vibrant. But it's still a tightly-wound thriller with plenty of unpolished fighting, bloody violence, and some moments of bleak humor (Lisbeth ""renting"" a car after shoving the clerk in a locker). The most disturbing parts are undeniably the flashbacks to Lisbeth's past, both with her family and in a psych ward (depicted in a surreal, blurry-white nightmare).

And it's all wound around more unpleasant aspects of modern Swedish society, centering on cruelty towards women -- sex trafficking in a modern country, and the evil ""Zala's"" ability to get away with anything he wanted.

And while Nyqvist does a good job here, the real spotlight here is on Noome Rapace. This woman is brilliant -- all lean wildcat energy, haunted eyes and half-hidden pain. While Lisbeth seems to have healed a little from her past experiences (she seems more open and friendly), there's still a river of darkness flowing just under the surface, and Rapace does a particularly good job when Lisbeth goes a-hunting for the bad guys.

""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" doesn't have the spark of the first movie, but it still has an electric brilliance and scathing social exploration. Too bad we have to wait so long for the finale!",1286496000,19,3220,4.882783882783883

With the movie The Girl who Played with Fire it seems a formula has been discovered. The story runs parallel between Lisbeth Salander, Mikael Blomkvist until towards the end the stories intersect. Lisbeth returns to Sweden to find that her state appointed ""guardian"" has been murdered and a gun found at the scene has her fingerprints on it. Blomkvist and his Millenium magazine are investigating a prostitution ring with high connected and influential clients. Unfortunately, this time around the stories seem too independent and separate from each other. Blomkvist and Salander only have minimal contact throughout the movie and there doesn't seem to be any real connection between them except the storyline dictates a reunion. When they do reunite there's no emotional impact or sense of relief that once again they were able to help each other.

None of the plot twists as they are revealed are too surprising. As a matter of fact they seem rather pedestrian and a little too predictable. In the film there also seems to be a little nod to Tarantino and maybe even Frankenstein, as the murderer has qualities that make him seem almost an invincible adversary incapable of being killed.

Lisbeth doesn't really seem to be playing with fire except in the literal sense that she lit her abusive father on fire. It doesn't seem like Lisbeth is playing with fire in a figurative sense. Her character is more reactive to situations, and it seems more like Lisbeth was playing with fire in her actions during The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Of course, in Dragon, the tattoo is just there, it has no active part in the plot except that Lisbeth has a dragon tattoo.

The Girl Who Played With Fire seems more of a disjointed movie than Dragon Tattoo. One of the criticisms of Dragon Tattoo was it being disjointed and as I said I read the book before seeing the movie of Dragon Tattoo so maybe I was able to fill in the blanks I wasn't able to with The Girl Who Played with Fire. It may be disjointed for those who haven't read the book.

With Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist reprising their roles as Lisbeth and Blomkvist respectively, their performances are still strong and believable as the characters. It's just the material they're given isn't as strong as the first movie.

There was a technical issue that was distracting. Some of the subtitles got lost in the bottom of the frame or were washed out by light. Hopefully that's a problem that can be corrected on the DVD.

A shortcoming of sequels is that they try to recreate the exact elements of the original reducing all the elements that made it new, interesting and different down to a formula. The Girl Who Played With Fire seems to fall into this trap.",1282953600,20,2946,4.664739884393064
3999707,4,B002VL5BWS,"Yes, I'm a Millennium Trilogy elitist: I read the the three books well before they became a publishing phenomenon (ordered each hard-cover direct from Amazon UK well before the US publications); I was a big fan of the first movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/B003FBNJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>) and saw it on the US release day; I think Noomi Rapace is the perfect Lisbeth; and I regularly harangue people that it's absurd to re-make the movies in English because they deserve to be seen in their native Swedish tongue.

However, I'm not blind to the fact that the cinematic adaptation of the second book falls short of the standard set by the first movie.  Perhaps the change in directors had something to do with that.  Though the three films were filmed back-to-back-to-back, Denmark's Niels Arden Oplev helmed the first installment, while Swede Daniel Alfredson took over for Parts II and III.  Oplev's 'Dragon Tattoo' crackles with suspense, makes great use of technology (love how Mikael pieces together the parade photographs) and portrays the sadistic violence perpetrated against Lisbeth in no-holds-barred, nothing-left-to-the-imagination fashion.  And when Lisbeth gets her stunning revenge against her erstwhile guardian, Nils Bjurman, Oplev stages his single best scene.  Watch the veins pop out of Rapace's neck as she (how to say this?) turns the table on her sodomizer.

Maybe Alfredson has less to work with: Book II has a slightly transitory feel to get to us to the third installment, and Lisbeth's 'crawling out of the grave' thing is a bit over the top.  But the movie feels listless compared to thrill ride of Oplev's finished product.  Alfredson's movie is a bit over two hours.  Oplev's was over two-and-a-half (the domestic Swedish release, in fact, clocked a full three hours).  I would have liked an extra 30+ minutes to take more time on any of Larsson's famous deep dives.  One thought would be to play up the misguided police manhunt railroading Lisbeth and prejudging her as member of a lesbian sadist cult.  This police malfeasance foreshadows ""Hornet's Nest.""  Instead, we get rat-a-tat-tat: murder; Lisbeth fingered (literally); Lisbeth sought; Lisbeth goes underground; Lisbeth tries to clear her name.

I do like that we got more of Lena Endre here.  Her Erika Berger was shortchanged in Oplev's take, and she steps a bit more to the front here.  And for the first time, we see that Erika and Mikael have a personal as well as work relationship.  I felt like Oplev neutered his Mikael, winnowing his relationships down only to Lisbeth in the film while in Larsson's tale he juggles three.  Alfredson makes the relationship clearer.  It's important because Erika plays a major part of Book III.",1282953600,3,2845,5.293986636971047
3999708,4,B002VL5BWS,"This is the second movie out of the Millennium Trilogy. Middle movies often have difficulties, since they end ""in media res."" That, of course, describes the second of the three works on Stieg Larsson's trilogy. However, this movie is still quite effective on its own merits.

For one thing, the character of Lisbeth Salander has been developed. And she is the focal point of this movie. Noomi Rapace continues her splendid acting in the role. She is not as tiny as the character described in the book (four feet eleven inches tall and about ninety pounds), but she seems to me to capture the character of Salander. She is coldly efficient when taking on people whom she deems ""bad"" or not leaving her in peace or men who hate women. That is exemplified here in her treatment of one of the ""johns"" who had been identified by a team--Dag and Mia (boyfriend-girlfriend)--who were in their separate ways examining sex trafficking in Sweden. And of her sanguinary meeting with the two bikers of Sweden's Hell's Angels ""wannabes.""

The story itself focuses on the murder of Dag and Mia--and of lawyer Bjurman, who was Salander's ""guardian."" She had been deemed incompetent many years before and was still caught in the system. When her former guardian, Palmgren, was felled by a stroke, Bjurman took over. He was hardly an impartial overseer. In the first movie, Salander had ""neutralized"" Bjurman. She had a powerful motive to kill him. Indeed, in the end, with her fingerprints on the gun that had killed all three people, she became wanted as the killer.

The book moves ahead from that premise. Her former lover and friend, Mickael Blomkvist, believes her to be innocent and sets out to try to find the real killer. They had not seen one another for a year and their communication is limited to e-mail and other indirect communication.

The movie speeds forward (it hardly seems to be over two hours long) to her inevitable confrontation with her father and a blonde giant who feels no pain (her taser has little effect on him). Her poignant e-mail message to Blomkvist as she headed off to face her father is powerful: ""Thank you for being my friend."" She ""comes back"" from the dead, having been severely wounded and left for dead. Her survival is somewhat improbable, but the touching meeting between her and Blomkvist at the end is powerful indeed. Palmgren is never identified as her former guardian (if you have read the books, you know who he is). This movie is closer to the book than the first, but that is not a matter of importance for either. They are both true to the spirit of the book and the key characters. A minor annoyance: At times the English subtitles are hard to read, as they are in light shading and when the screen is light, too, it's a bit tough to read--but, not a major issue.

The ending is powerful, leaving us to wonder what is to be the fate of Lisbeth and how the conspiracy to imprison her because of her father's value to the secret service of Sweden is to end. A worthy sequel to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""",1282348800,45,3048,4.637037037037037

In ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" the situation gets reversed when Salander is accused of a triple murder and it is the investigative journalist who has to come to the aid of the computer hacker, especially once Salander decides to take things into her own hand.  Once again we have the collision of both personalities and parallel investigations in this middle part of Stieg Larsson's triology (and I want to underscore that the three books do indeed constitute a true trilogy and not simply the first three books in a series that will never be finished).  It is certainly interesting to see a movie in a theater that is being projected from a DVD, but, hey, that is how things are in the Zenith City when it comes to seeing foreign films.  We take what we can get any way we can and we learn to like it.

I was in a position where as soon as I finished reading ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-with-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/0307454541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>"" I was able to watch the movie version, at which point I started reading ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Played-with-Fire/dp/030745455X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Played with Fire</a>"" and only had to wait a day and a half after I finished it to see this film.  Consequently, I am looking at ""Flickan som lekte med elden"" more as an adaptation of Larsson's novel than as a movie that stands on its own simply because that is not my perspective.  I think this is a better adapation of the novel than the first film, mainly because the second novel is more streamlined than the first, which basically means ""Mn som hatar kvinnor"" was at a disadvantage because even at two and a half hours in length it was going to have to jettison a lot of what happened in the novel.  They also found a way of fast forwarding the main plot line by having Salander shadow Blomkvist's investigation on his computer.  Of course there are some short cuts in this 2009 Swedish film, but nothing that drastically reconceptualized the story.  Whether this is true because of the differences in the first two novels, or because this time around both the screenwriter (Jonas Frykberg) and the director (Daniel Alfredson) are different, I cannot say.  But the important thing is that I was not as annoyed by the omissions and alterations as the first time around (i.e., they kept all of the violence but cut out a lot of the sex, which significantly gelded Blomkvist's character).

Readers of the novel have a big advantage over those whose exposure to these characters is only through the cinema because a key characteristic of Lisabeth Salander is that she rarely talks and when she does she is not inclined to reveal what she is thinking.  But as we know from reading the novels, she thinks a lot, and while it is not the way the rest of us think in a world where the sky is (usually) blue, it is our key way of accessing the peculiar world in which she sees herself living.  Having read that book the same week I saw the film meant I was certainly able to fill in the silences and flesh out the story.  I have accepted Rapace and Nyqvist as Salander and Blomqvist, even though I keep thinking Salander should be smaller.  The main thing is that Rapace has the requisite look in her eyes when her character visually dissects people.  I find Nyqvist to be perfectly cast, and as much as I like Daniel Cragi's James Bond, I wonder if he will be able to soften up enough to capture the characters as well in the upcoming Americanization of these Swedish films.  My major concern would be that Alfredson's direction is rather bland, especially in terms of the last act when we get to what should be the dramatic action sequence.  I also noticed that the film goes a bit beyond the end of the novel, into the beginning of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Kicked-the-Hornet-s-Nest/dp/030726999X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</a>,"" but in some ways that hint at some more streamlining.

3999712,4,B002VL5BWS,"The second of the Stieg Larson ""Milleneum"" series, ""The Girl That Played With Fire"" is solid, fine entertainment. It does not however, live up to the originality and suspense of the predecessor, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"".

I do not want to ""spoil"" the film, so I'll keep the plot description brief. Living abroad, Lisbeth Salander (Noomie Rapace, who repeats her great performance from ""Dragon Tattoo"") returns to Sweden to catch up on some ""old business"". Meanwhile her estwhile lover and head of ""Milleneum"" magazine Mikael Blomkvist (a fine Michael Nyqvist) has just hired a young reporter who's research into Stockholm's sex trade spills over into a triple homicide with Lisbeth as the prime suspect.

The overall plot is okay and somewhat interesting, there are some very good scenes and impressive visuals (especially a structure set on fire in the woods). And the pacing which seemed pitch-perfect in ""Tattoo"" lags somewhat in ""Fire"". It didn't help that the subtitles were faint and almost impossible to read during scenes with a bright background. It made following the plot more difficult, but not impossible. Hopefully this will be corrected in the DVD version.

Perhaps the most controversial point is the ending which left many patrons of the theater I was at rather dismayed. I can understand their reaction, but this is the second of a three-part series. The final film to be released in the US later this year. So in that context I think the ending was perfectly fine.

As with ""Tattoo"", this film contains nudity, violence, gore, and has a rather racey sex scene that does stay within the ""R"" rating. Although ""Fire"" can stand on it's own, I do recommend viewing the ""Dragon Tattoo"" first as it does help in getting into ""Fire"".

I can say that Rapace's performance will make whoever plays Lisbeth in the upcoming ""American"" version very hard to match. She is a true talent, although I must add that the character of Lisbeth is one of the best we've seen in films for quite a while.

I was not disappointed with ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"", but it could've been better. Perhaps the third film will live up to the promise of the first.",1281225600,4,2163,4.816711590296496

The Girl with the dragon Tattoo was a surprising hit for the Sweden film industry, which had been in decline since the retirement of Ingmar Bergman. The first film was quite an achievement as it developed an interesting case of a missing girl who seems to have been killed by members of her own troubled family. Linking anti-Semitism and Nazism with murder, the film produced an intriguing tale that was a throwback to classic film noir. Before the charm of the main characters set in, the first film created a baffling mystery that engrossed the viewer in its web of mystery. By the ending of the picture, it was clear that the characters, especially Lisbeth Salander, could pull of any additional mystery in the future sequels. But the issue with The Girl Who Played with Fire is that its mystery is not as persuasive as the previous feature. The first film contained the mystery of a beautiful blond girl, who was adored by her multimillionaire grandfather, who had disappeared after a festival. The villains, their motivations, the involvement of the tale in the outskirts of Sweden, and the fascinating family history that Mikael Blomkvist had to investigate was partially behind the enormous success of the first film. The second film, however, lacks that fascinating mystery, and strangely lacks a coherent mystery. It moves along creating and molding as many things as it can to create a film the audience will be intoxicated with. Unlike the first film that created a Sherlock Holmes like mystery, this film invests in a tale that is much like your recent Hollywood junk. It creates as it moves along, so the audience has to unwillingly trust the intellect of the filmmaker in creating an acceptable solution to the mystery, rather than engaging the intellect to solve the story along with the characters. The first film centered on the beautiful blond, and this one centers on a mystery involving the ""sadistic pig"" of Lisbeth's guardian. Neither is he the character we would want to be concerned for in the whole duration of the movie, nor is he an appealing character that we are worried and anxious about.

When a young man with an exciting exposition of many major figures begins working for Millennium magazine, he does not realize he is well over his head by attempting to incriminate the most powerful men in Sweden. When he and his girlfriend are brutally murdered, the police gather sufficient evidence to find Lisbeth the culprit, but Blomkvist doubts her role in the crime. The mystery is just a set-up to introduce and capitalize on Lisbeth's surprising past, especially her childhood. If this had been explained in a more subtle way, there could be hope in the story itself. The film has a Chinatown-like approach to Lisbeth's past, where the intimating characters seem to be related to the female character due to some despicable and moral decay. Her past is not entirely surprising, but it does display her as a developed and emotional human being, rather than an ambivalent character sketch. Unfortunately, the secrets are thrust forward with improper urgency that makes the revelation inelegant for a film that has spent such effort in concealing her true identity. The secrets are reveled in bulk, in an enforced courtroom drama fashion that seems untimely and rather pedestrian.

The film is not only a step down from the first feature, but also shows the weak storytelling of Steig Larseen, if this work is truly faithful to his vision. In one truly preposterous scene, that belongs to the history books, Lisbeth with help of the Hades-the Greek god of the underworld-escapes death after being buried alive at midnight and freeing herself after sunrise. Not only ludicrous in composition, considering that she has been covered by mud and dirt, but also insulting to the audience based on it's (nearly) sheer impossibility. Lisbeth is an ideal, and underrated, character for any crime film, but there is so much a character can accomplish without the aid of a stellar screenplay or source.

3999715,4,B002VL5BWS,"The late Stieg Larsson centered his Millennium Trilogy around cruelty towards women -- and the movie adaptations don't hold back either.

The second movie of the trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" is a tightly wound thriller that is almost as good as the first. It lacks some of the raw, wild, dark energy, but it tangles together some razor-sharp social commentary (sex trafficking) with car chases and conspiracies. Best of all, it still has brilliant performances by Michael Nyqvist and Noome Rapace.

A year after ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" Millennium magazine has a new reporter -- Dag Svensson (Hans Christian Thulin) and his girlfriend are doing reports on sex trafficking and prostitution. But then Mikael (Nyqvist) finds both of them dead in their apartment, and Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson) -- the cruel ""guardian"" who raped Lisbeth -- has been brutally shot in the head.

Since Lisbeth (Rapace) just returned to Stockholm (and threatened to shoot Bjurman), she becomes the No. 1 suspect in all three murders. Even though, y'know, she had no motive for two of them.

Of course, Mikael doesn't believe that she did it -- especially since a hostile blond giant is going around beating up anyone (a trainer, a casual girlfriend) who might know Lisbeth's whereabouts. As Lisbeth goes on her own dark mission, she tells Mikael that he should look for someone named ""Zala."" But when Mikael starts hunting for information on this mystery man, he also learns more about Lisbeth's dark past...

Lisbeth Salander was something of a mystery in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" -- we knew she was troubled, a brilliant hacker, and had been in a psych ward. But ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" rips away all that mystery and shows us where Lisbeth Salander came from, and how she became a lonely, punky avenging angel. It's pretty nasty, and it ends on a cliffhanger (for crying out loud!).

The biggest problem with this story is that it lacks the raw, primal energy that made the first movie so vibrant. But it's still a tightly-wound thriller with plenty of unpolished fighting, bloody violence, and some moments of bleak humor (Lisbeth ""renting"" a car after shoving the clerk in a locker). The most disturbing parts are undeniably the flashbacks to Lisbeth's past, both with her family and in a psych ward (depicted in a surreal, blurry-white nightmare).

And it's all wound around more unpleasant aspects of modern Swedish society, centering on cruelty towards women -- sex trafficking in a modern country, and the evil ""Zala's"" ability to get away with anything he wanted.

And while Nyqvist does a good job here, the real spotlight here is on Noome Rapace. This woman is brilliant -- all lean wildcat energy, haunted eyes and half-hidden pain. While Lisbeth seems to have healed a little from her past experiences (she seems more open and friendly), there's still a river of darkness flowing just under the surface, and Rapace does a particularly good job when Lisbeth goes a-hunting for the bad guys.

""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" doesn't have the spark of the first movie, but it still has an electric brilliance and scathing social exploration. Too bad we have to wait so long for the finale!",1279843200,,3220,4.882783882783883

Larsson's novels are littered with complicated (to the English reader) Swedish names whose corresponding characters seemingly have no real purpose within each individual plot.  Perhaps only by the 5th or 12th installment, if Larsson had been able to fully realize his storylines, the roles of this vast Scandinavian population would make perfect sense beneath the larger umbrella biodome-ing the entire Larsson universe.  Unfortunately, only three books exist, peppered with a raft of personnel the function of which only the late author in his omnipotent sense as creator fully understood.

Perhaps, even though he is faithfully following the blueprint of the book, that is why some criticism is directed at director Daniel Alfredson's adaptation of the second `Girl' offering in the Millennium trilogy.  Complaints have been made by a number of reviewers that the two leads don't share enough simultaneous screen time.  Oh well--that's not the way Larsson wrote his novel.  Likewise, the film ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" duplicates with just enough angry misogyny, gritty action and labyrinthine conspiracy undercurrents the ongoing story of Lisbeth Salander.  Larsson wrote his stories more like serials than novels and the respective directors of the first two films are true to his concept.  The films are meant to be seen in sequence, not as stand alones.

After Blomkvist and Salander are thrown together to solve a forty-year old mystery in director Niels Arden Oplev's admirably rendered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/B003FBNJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>, they part company; Salander, enamored with the promiscuous Blomkvist cannot quite get her necessarily controlled feelings back in check.  She decides a disappearance act is in order and goes about her business, vacationing around the world, monitoring her newfound millions and keeping track of her guardian, the despicable Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson).  When something amiss flags her attention, she returns to Stockholm a year in time after the first film and lands smack into a plot that plunges her into her troubled past and an uncertain future.  With a synchronicity worthy of a Dickens serial, Blomkvist concurrently works with a young couple investigating a human trafficking ring.  When they are murdered, and Salander is implemented, Mikael and Lisbeth collaborate again as unlikely yet strangely compatible partners.

As in the first film, Noomi Rapace portrays Lisbeth with the edgy deadpan certainty that gives Larsson's character the plucky punch that no one familiar with her can fail to admire.  Darkly intelligent, yet emotionally vulnerable, Rapace's rage smolders with a relentless momentum.  A veritable flame-throwing Terminatrix, despite her diminutive size, she takes giant steps leaving those around her burning in her wake.  Good luck, American producers, finding a `Lisbeth' comparable to Noomi Rapace.  She is Lisbeth.

Similarly, as her unlikely foil, Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist, renders a reality to the journalist that the actor chosen for the English-speaking Hollywood version of the film will have a hard time duplicating.  Clever, self-aggrandizing and unabashed at his unconventional sexually charged relationships, Nyqvist knowingly smirks at Salander's audacity and the audience grins with approval even though as avid fans of the books, they know the couple will come physically together only at climatic times in the plotline.

If we, as admirers of Larsson's creations, are lucky, someone worthy will pick up the threads of not only Salander and Blomkvist, but Berger, Bublansky, Armansky, Miriam, Paolo and the newer characters introduced in the last of the trilogy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Kicked-the-Hornet-s-Nest/dp/030726999X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</a>, and weave them together within the telling of newer stories incorporating the police procedural with a continuing furthering of the lives that populate the Larsson universe.  As masterful characters, Blomkvist and Salander must go on, sleuthing towards answers to unsolved and as of now, unwritten mysteries lending their particular strengths to the overall safety of metropolitan Stockholm while figuring out the more complicated conundrum: what they mean to each other.

Bottom line?  As a stand-alone film, TGWPWF, works as the second episode in a mini-series: it needs the first cinematic effort to render meaning to the goings-on that follow.  Director Alfredson gives us a little background with some cellular flashback, but without an understanding of the characters' motives as developed in TGWTDT, this offering may seem like a rush of action that has little nuance.  True to the plotline of the book, however, Alfredson brings the story to life.  Whether or not we desire more togetherness for Salander and Blomkvist remains irrelevant.  Larsson crafted his game plan and the filmmaker successfully whittles his story to fit into a compelling and enjoyable two and a half hour format.  Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth Salander with a repressed intelligent diligence.  Highly recommended for Larsson fans and any one else who likes a good thriller.  See TGWTDT first.

3999717,4,B002VL5BWS,"(3.5 stars) The second film from the Millenium Trilogy of novels by Stieg Larsson, The Girl Who Played with Fire,  like its predecessor, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, hews closely to the plot line of the novel. Without any introduction, the life story of Lisbeth Salander continues where it left off, as she tries to navigate a world which damaged her to the point that she has difficulty relating to all humans.  This film features the same cast in the lead roles as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo though both the director and the cinematographers have changed.  Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a computer hacker extraordinaire, has returned from a year of traveling the world, during which time Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist), publisher of Millenium magazine, moved on with his life.  Millenium Magazine is investigating the sex trade and its relationship to the drug trade, and a young freelancer who has been hired by Millenium has uncovered evidence that officials at the highest levels of the legal and political system are involved.

Rapace as Lisbeth and Nyqvist as Blomqvist had remarkable chemistry in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but they are rarely in the same scene in this film.  Like the book, this film is Lisbeth's story, and as her background unfolds, the reader comes to know how and why she was institutionalized and why she is so damaged.  Like the book, also, this film is weaker than its predecessor, though lovers of the trilogy will still find it fun to watch.  Some nudity, horrific violence, and explicit sex also appear here, as they did in the previous film.  Though this is a bloodier film, it seems somehow less dramatic, more formulaic.

With its change of director and cinematographers, this film lacks the icy sparkle and brittle atmosphere of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The scenes in this film are as dark as they were in that film, but the sharp visual contrasts and dramatic changes of lighting, which added to the suspense and mood, are missing here.  It becomes more of an action film than an intense character-based study filled with menace, mood, and almost palpable suspense, and it is less coherent than the previous film.

Two characters, Ronald Niedermann (played by Micke Spreitz), the sadistic giant who cannot feel pain, and Holger Palmgren (played by Per Oscarsson), the man who was Lisbeth's early and much admired guardian before he was replaced by Nils Bjurmann, add special drama to the film, the first because he is so terrifying, and the second because he seems so needy and so honorable.  Unfortunately, Holger Palmgren, who is known to readers of the novel, is not clearly identified in this film, and newcomers to the series will have little, if any, idea who he is or what his role has been in Lisbeth's past life.

Those who enjoyed the book will probably also like the film.  It is not as moody or atmospheric as the first film, and it is loose in its construction (as was the novel), but it moves the story line along so that those who see it will probably be waiting anxiously for the final film installment, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, due out this fall.

3999718,5,B002VL5BWS,"""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" - I did not read this second book in the Millennium trilogy so the movie was all new to me. Lisbeth Salander (perfectly delineated by Noomi Rapace, a great fit for the part)has been absent from Sweden for a year since we last met her in ""Tattoo"" living a life of luxury in various countries. She buys an apartment in Stockholm, but no one knows about it. The sexually ambivalent Lisbeth wants to get her dossier from her sadistic guardian, Bjurman, and when he isn't forthcoming, she warns him he may get another harsh dose of the previous punishment she doled out to him.
Meanwhile the movie follows a second track of narrative. Mikael Blomkvist (well-acted by Michael Nygvist), publisher of the muckraking magazine Millennium, has hired a free lancer to write an article about sex traffickers and the johns that are involved in the trade. He intends to out some of the prominent johns.
The two parallel stories are like procedural crime tales, and at a crucial stage, the two narratives intersect. There's violence, sex, gore, fires, spies, car chases, torture scenes, and suspense as we follow the protagonists. Lisbeth always seems to be immersed in intrigue, and nasty stuff. There's some computer wizardry in this one, but not as much as in the first film. She's forced on the run from the law because she's accused of three murders.
Lisbeth's cruel father whom she has torched as a child comes blazing back in this sequel.
It ends in a cliffhanger that will entice viewers into seeing the third film in the series this fall.
The film is excellent, chilling, and absorbing, but I liked the first one better because it was more focused and involved more interaction between the two principals; it was more human and more touching than this one.
Lisbeth is as tough and wily as ever. There is superb acting and cinematography. The movie is in Swedish with English sub-titles which means it won't be seen by a wide American audience although it deserves to be. I have an uneasy feeling that when the American versions are made, they won't be nearly as good as these fine films partly because these two stars are perfect for their parts. It's an intricately plotted, labyrinthine, tantalizing mystery. It can be a standalone thriller even if you haven't read the novel.",1279152000,130,2303,4.774436090225564
3999719,4,B002VL5BWS,"The late Stieg Larsson centered his Millennium Trilogy around cruelty towards women -- and the movie adaptations don't hold back either.

The second movie of the trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" is a tightly wound thriller that is almost as good as the first. It lacks some of the raw, wild, dark energy, but it tangles together some razor-sharp social commentary (sex trafficking) with car chases and conspiracies. Best of all, it still has brilliant performances by Michael Nyqvist and Noome Rapace.

A year after ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" Millennium magazine has a new reporter -- Dag Svensson (Hans Christian Thulin) and his girlfriend are doing reports on sex trafficking and prostitution. But then Mikael (Nyqvist) finds both of them dead in their apartment, and Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson) -- the cruel ""guardian"" who raped Lisbeth -- has been brutally shot in the head.

Since Lisbeth (Rapace) just returned to Stockholm (and threatened to shoot Bjurman), she becomes the No. 1 suspect in all three murders. Even though, y'know, she had no motive for two of them.

Of course, Mikael doesn't believe that she did it -- especially since a hostile blond giant is going around beating up anyone (a trainer, a casual girlfriend) who might know Lisbeth's whereabouts. As Lisbeth goes on her own dark mission, she tells Mikael that he should look for someone named ""Zala."" But when Mikael starts hunting for information on this mystery man, he also learns more about Lisbeth's dark past...

Lisbeth Salander was something of a mystery in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" -- we knew she was troubled, a brilliant hacker, and had been in a psych ward. But ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" rips away all that mystery and shows us where Lisbeth Salander came from, and how she became a lonely, punky avenging angel. It's pretty nasty, and it ends on a cliffhanger (for crying out loud!).

The biggest problem with this story is that it lacks the raw, primal energy that made the first movie so vibrant. But it's still a tightly-wound thriller with plenty of unpolished fighting, bloody violence, and some moments of bleak humor (Lisbeth ""renting"" a car after shoving the clerk in a locker). The most disturbing parts are undeniably the flashbacks to Lisbeth's past, both with her family and in a psych ward (depicted in a surreal, blurry-white nightmare).

And it's all wound around more unpleasant aspects of modern Swedish society, centering on cruelty towards women -- sex trafficking in a modern country, and the evil ""Zala's"" ability to get away with anything he wanted.

And while Nyqvist does a good job here, the real spotlight here is on Noome Rapace. This woman is brilliant -- all lean wildcat energy, haunted eyes and half-hidden pain. While Lisbeth seems to have healed a little from her past experiences (she seems more open and friendly), there's still a river of darkness flowing just under the surface, and Rapace does a particularly good job when Lisbeth goes a-hunting for the bad guys.

""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" doesn't have the spark of the first movie, but it still has an electric brilliance and scathing social exploration. Too bad we have to wait so long for the finale!",1278892800,46,3220,4.882783882783883
3999720,4,B002VL5BWS,"""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is the second in Stieg Larsson's 'Millennium Trilogy.'  It is as good as the first ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" but loses some of it fresh shock value as we already know the amazing Lisbeth (Noomi Rapace).  The character is gripping and still captivates as she survives murderous relatives and memories of her brutal upbringing.

Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) is the publisher of Millennium magazine in Stockholm, and has a high profile job exposing corruption of important and revered Swedish elite.  A young journalist approaches Blomkvist with a well researched thesis about sex trafficking in Sweden.  It reveals that many in high offices abuse underage girls, and Blomkvist immediately throws himself into the investigation when the young journalist and his girlfriend are murdered.  The plot is intriguing and many threads tie Lisbeth's sociopathic relatives into the mix.

Both Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist deepen their strange compelling symbiotic relationship in their search for justice.",1278892800,6,1031,5.446540880503145

Some of the graphic scenes are not for the squeamish so read the content advisory before watching.
