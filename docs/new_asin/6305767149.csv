7894712,4,6305767149,"The great Adam Cheng stars as a wondering fighter, caught up in a large tangled web, of hate, dishonor, and murder.  armed with his metal fan, and  the help of a mysterious swords man, he takes on all evil.  The most  variety i have seen when it comes to weapons in one movie, each character  has his own personalized weapon.  The characters are great, villians evil  and disturbing, and the fight scenes amazing.  Good film",967334400,,424,4.56
