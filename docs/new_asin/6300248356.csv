282098,5,6300248356,"A real good performance artist doesn't need snakes on ther shoulders, lesbians acts, or any kind of FX...Cyndi Lauper delivery a ""must have in your video collection"" concert.
Nothing but she and her band.
Great entrance, singing all her 80's hits, from romantic ballads like ""Time after time"", to the powerful ""Money changes everything""  a lot of energy, and an amazing performance of Jackie's Wilson song ""Baby workout""  she holds very high notes,almost ""un-human"" .
 If you are the kind who like to eat while watching , bring all your snacks before you start the show, cause you are not gonna want to move from your tv until the end.
 Ballads, pop, and rock & roll, this girl sure knows how to sing...great entertainment!!!",1072742400,5,725,4.82258064516129

282100,5,6300248356,"I put off buying this video for a long time because I thought to myself, ""How would this ever go out of stock?""  Well guess what, it's no longer being made. I originally watched this concert on HBO about 13 years ago and I loved it!!  Cyndi never stopped moving for a minute, gave 100% on every song and looked like she was having the time of her life. What an incredible performer! If you even remotely like Cyndi Lauper, seek out to find this video, you will not be disappointed. I strongly recommend it!",973900800,12,506,4.315789473684211

7807605,5,6300248356,The best Cyndi Lauper recording in my opinion.  my first copy wore out so this was my second purchase.  It's not too easy to come by since it's out of print.,1379030400,,157,4.032258064516129
7807606,5,6300248356,"Cyndi Lauper at her best.

She is always great but this video has all of her iconic songs, plus her band is great.  I love the woman with the bangos and the lead guitarrist.  They were (are) all awesome!",1371427200,,203,4.153846153846154
7807607,5,6300248356,"my husband had a copy of this from when it originally came out and we have watched it until it is a little worse for wear, so when I saw this i knew we had a replacement.  The only thing better would be if someone put it on DVD.  This show in Paris is one of the best concert videos i've ever seen.  Her rendition of ""hey You"" is amazing and this is the only place you'll see it.  This video came thru a vendor via Amazon and they did an excellent job getting this to me in a timely manner - actually beating Amazon.",1368316800,,516,3.8857142857142857

7807609,5,6300248356,Cyndi Lauper is hot and the VHS has more content than the HBO special. Excellent camera work and Rick Derringer had some great guitar licks.,1334016000,,140,4.64
7807610,5,6300248356,"I recently caught Cyndi in performance on her current ""Memphis Blues"" tour.  She is as energetic and dynamic now at age 57 as she was when she made this concert video more than 20 years ago.  I struck up a conversation with the couple sitting next to me and yes, they were suitably impressed.  But the fact that they were a little surprised at the quality of Cyndi's performance and the overall show was also a reminder that in the public imagination, Cyndi Lauper remains something of a novelty act--and that, for better or worse, she has to prove herself as a performer and artist over and over again.

Although she really did achieve superstar status for a time in the 1980s, it's also true that Cyndi Lauper was underrated pretty much from the get go.  Her time as a critical darling pretty much lasted as long as the hubbub generated around SHE'S SO UNUSUAL was still happening.  People tend to forget that TRUE COLORS got pretty mixed reviews, and that much of that record's appeal to both the rock-crit establishment and the general public had to do with the title track, a huge hit but really her LAST truly huge hit.

She deserved better.  A truly remarkable singer of considerable range and an intense live performer, there was no reason for ever fade from public view or for nearly EVERY new release to be billed as some sort of comeback.  (Truth is, Lauper has remained a creative force in popular music for over 25 years: it's the public AND the critics who are coming back to HER.)

The Paris concert, taped as part of the TRUE COLORS tour, shows Cyndi in top form.  One of the things about the second solo release that has never been emphasized enough is that it was a SINGER'S album.  SHE'S SO UNUSUAL spotlighted Cyndi's vocal strength at key moments (the tail end of ""Money Changes Everything,"" for instance) but it was more about establishing a persona.  On TRUE COLORS she had many more rave up moments (""911,"" ""Boy Blue,"" ""Maybe He'll Know,"" ""Calm Inside the Storm"").  In other words, she now had enough dynamite PERFORMANCE material to do a concert video, so while a concert video follow-up to SHE'S SO UNUSUAL might have been possible--and certainly lucrative--she was wise to wait a few years.

The Cyndi Lauper presented on this video is every inch the sweetly eccentric 80s pop star people had come to love (and to expect), but for those who hadn't been paying attention, she emerges as a powerhouse performer as well.  She surprised people back then, just as much as she does now.  The fact that she's been able to keep on keeping on for a quarter century is a testament to her endurance.  This video (and the more recent LIVE AT LAST and the upcoming ""Memphis Blues"" DVDs) should erase any doubts about the QUALITY of her work.  Cyndi puts on a truly colorful, lively show--but she doesn't need acrobats, live animals and the Rockettes to make it great.  The strong heartfelt vocals are enough to do the trick.",1293753600,,2938,4.6134615384615385
7807611,5,6300248356,"Cyndi Lauper is electric and shows the Paris audience why she is such a dynamic performer. This is really worth watching for any 80's music fan, or Cyndi fan.",1250380800,2,158,4.482758620689655
7807612,5,6300248356,"Words cannot fully describe how great this concert is. In short, it was THE BEST concert filmed in the 1980's. Cyndi, to the ""I love yous"" heard throughout the concert I gladly add mine. EVERYTHING about this concert gets an A+, from Cyndi's outstanding performance, to the songs, to the band to how the concert was filmed. The balance is there. The energy Cyndi shows throughout the concert is inspirational. From ""Change Of Heart"" through ""She Bop"" and ""Baby Workout"" Cyndi delivers ""the goods"" big time. Why? Because she has ""the goods"" to deliver. I promise you, you WILL NOT find a better concert. Also, I cannot say enough about the band led (in my opinion) by the great Sterling Campbell on drums. His great drumming adds greatly to this concert( as does the bass player Kevin Jacobs and lead guitar player Rick D. Sue A is also great on percussion. Sterling now plays with the B-52's. Check him out if you can). I've been watching this great concert for twenty years, and hope to watch it for twenty more. Greatness never grows old.",1181001600,4,1040,4.657608695652174
