8597253,2,B000E117KC,"Disappointed in the initial review and the video as it really is a CD of the players doing some drills, a couple of good ones, but that's not what I was looking for.  I was hoping it was a more systematic review of the patterns of play and role responsibilites of the players in a 3-4-3.  There was a very small segment on a single patter of play moving up the flank but other than that, nothing much.  There was a discussion about its merits and also the 4-3-3 - which I coach now - but I wouldn't say I have any better understanding of implementing a 3-4-3 prior to before I watched it.  Trying to implement the 3-4-3 was why I bought it so I would have to say it wasn't of great value to me other than the additonal drills.",1174953600,9,726,4.091549295774648
8597254,5,B000E117KC,This is a great instructional video for Women's/Girls' soccer coaches out there wanting to keep up with the cutting edge tactics of today's elite soccer programs.  Anson explains the framework of the system that has given his program an incredible edge in the women's game.  Along with this video I highly recommend having your team attend The North Carolina Girls Soccer Camp (team camp) to fully understand and implement the 1-3-4-3.  I have been lucky enough to work for him in the past and the insight you will get in person will have you fully understanding the system that has taken the women's game to the next evolutionary level.,1162512000,2,637,4.825688073394495
