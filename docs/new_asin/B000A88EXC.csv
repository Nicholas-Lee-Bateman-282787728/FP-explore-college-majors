2379383,5,B000A88EXC,"These songs are beautiful and tender.  They can be played with the English translation on the screen if you desire.  (The words to all the Cri-Cri songs can be found online.)

My grandson can sit transfixed the whole time the DVD is playing while taking his asthma treatment on a vaporizer.  It fascinates children and is very calming. And they may be learning at the same time.  Win, win.",1171584000,6,389,4.579710144927536
2379384,5,B000A88EXC,"This is a good work that presents the work of Francisco Gabilondo Soler, and the cartoons are very good. I love and my kids too. This album is in spanish",1168905600,2,153,4.133333333333334
2379385,5,B000A88EXC,"I USED TO LISTEN TO THESE SONGS AS A CHILD AND NOW MY BABIES ARE ABLE TO DO SO TOO, AND NOT ONLY DO THEY GET TO LISTEN BUT THEY ALSO GET TO VIEW THE SONGS STORY WITH THE DVD THEY ONLY SHOW ABOUT 13 SONGS IN THE DVD BUT THE CD HAS TONS OF SONGS AND EVERYTHING IS IN SPANISH I USED THE CD IN MY CHILDRENS PARTIES THEY LOVE TO SING TO THESE SONGS. ITS A MUST HAVE FOR CHILDREN THAT SPEAK SPANISH. OR IF YOU ARE ENCOURAGING THEM TO LEARN SPANISH",1167782400,8,441,3.702127659574468
2379396,5,B000A88EXC,"Aunque este disco no es del original cantante, las versiones de las canciones son buenisimas. La cantante canta de lo mas linda. Las canciones todas son muy tiernas, como fabulas o cuentos de animales o lo que sea. Ademas, las animaciones son bonitas.",1323993600,2,251,4.8604651162790695
2379397,1,B000A88EXC,"The DVD cover should straight-forwardly state that this video does not include Gabilondo Soler's singing.  HE IS CRI CRI, and it is hard to accept anyone else's singing for this music.  The back of the cover has credits for the intro only, which is the one and only piece with the original Conjunto de Gabilondo Soler.  The lady's singing is in tune and sometimes pretty, but very cold, lacks animation, and never playful.  I am very disappointed in Sony's crooked presentation, more so than in the quality of this video.",1294444800,2,521,4.7555555555555555
2379398,1,B000A88EXC,"Okay; I really respect the reviews of others and I made the decision to buy this DVD based on reviews.  I knew it wasn't going to be the original artist, but I have been searching for something to put a visiual to these beautiful classic songs.  I also wanted to expose my 18 month old daughter to spanish and I was hoping for something to engage her visualy as well so she can start associating words with actions.

This DVD fell so short of that.  So much of the original musican's work is lost by the lady singing with just some basic instruments.  There's no emotion felt with the song/music/graphics that is used in this DVD.  The visual effect is that of what you would find in a book and not an actual ""movie"" storyline. A lot of what the original artist used to create the storyline was the orchresta music, which this DVD lacks.  My daughter didn't even look up to watch. I will keep the DVD in hopes that maybe when she is older she can appreciate them.

I have purchased a Christian spanish DVD by Manuel Bonilla, and the music and graphics are captevating and catches my daughter's attention.",1263168000,2,1104,4.430693069306931
2379399,5,B000A88EXC,"I LOVE this DVD! All of my kids love it. My Daughter will watch it 15 times in a row if I let her. It has cute images, the words are clear, and sung nicely.",1252972800,,156,3.4857142857142858
2379400,1,B000A88EXC,This is not the real voice of cri cri-it is a lady instead. If you are looking for the real voice of cri cri do not buy the dvd. It misleading.,1232496000,2,143,3.6451612903225805
2379401,5,B000A88EXC,"Since he was only 9 months old, this DVD mesmerized my son. Every kid is different, so who knows? We speak to him in English and Spanish, but I don't think it's the language that attracts him. I think it's the tunes and the animation. It's been great for us!",1230249600,,258,4.18
2379402,5,B000A88EXC,"I grew up singing all the Cri cri songs.  Now with my 2 year old son, we had been playing the songs since he was born.  We own 2 CD collections. It was not until we got this DVD that he really understood who Cri Cri was.  He asks us every day to play the DVDs and CDs.  It is one of his favorites.  We learned about this DVD through some friends that spoke wonders about the DVD and the quality of the drawings. It has subtitles to sing along with the songs. We like it so much that I am ready to purchase a few more for all my spanish speaking friends and also for my non spanish speaking friends that want their children to learn spanish.",1222905600,,640,3.96875
2379403,5,B000A88EXC,I was very impressed with the DVD of some of the infamous Cri-Cri classics.  My 17 month old enjoys it and I enjoy it too since I was raised on these songs when I was young.  I bought the set for all my neices at the same age group--so they could also learn Spanish too.  Love it!!!,1212969600,2,282,3.912280701754386
2379404,4,B000A88EXC,"This is not original Cri-Cri (Francisco Gabilondo) singing. The lady performing is very good though. And the music is great, as well as the animated cartoons. It's a shame that in order to sell more, the producer (Gabilondo's descendant) has to hide the fact that it is not an original Cri-Cri recording. The dvd is great in and on itself.",1197504000,14,339,4.666666666666667
2379405,5,B000A88EXC,"I grew up with these songs as a kid (I'm in my 30s) and still remember them.  The songs are stories of very imaginative things (cowboy mouse, chocolate king, etc.) with a very nice melody for the kids.  The songs are catchy and timeless, in fact my mother in law sings them to my son before I bought the CD. All songs are in spanish and are very well done, highly recommend even if your kids do not speak spanish, maybe they will learn a word or two.",1193529600,,450,4.1022727272727275

8076116,5,B000A88EXC,Este Dvd de Cricri esta hermoso. Lo unico que no me gusto mucho fue que las canciones las canta una mujer y no Francisco Gabilondo Soler (cricri). Los dibujos son tiernos y a mis sobrinitos les encanta.,1364860800,,202,4.486486486486487
