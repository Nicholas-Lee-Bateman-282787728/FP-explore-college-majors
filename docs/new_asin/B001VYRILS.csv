8346815,5,B001VYRILS,"We saw this on TCM and I'm glad I recorded it. The star, Fernand Charpin is a brilliant cross between Charlie Chaplin and W.C. Fields, but he's funnier than either. He brilliantly pulls off physical humor (especially watch his hands as he describes the job of a film editor), while at the same time profoundly adding to the pathos of the situation he and the other actors find themselves in. While the film has elements of slapstick and is often hilarious, the humor is deep and wise. The film traces the transformation of Le Schpontz from an angry deluded lonely buffoon (another meaning of Schpountz is insulting slang for a German) to a happy, wise, successful, and dignified comedian. The supporting cast are all superb. The sentimentality is similar to that in American comedies of the late '30s, but instead of finding it cloying, we were moved by it, the hallmark of great acting and great directing.

If you love movies, you will love and treasure this film.
