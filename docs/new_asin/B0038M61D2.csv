4087980,5,B0038M61D2,Definitely a worthwhile sketch comedy to watch. If you liked the last two seasons then I'd recommend checking this one out.,1278979200,,123,4.904761904761905
4088031,5,B0038M61D2,"Great show, with great sketches. They do a great job at showing how rediculous stereotypes are, showing how people can be too sensitive about things, and how sometimes laughter is the solution. They are very great at showing social problems using humor. I suggest watching all of their work. Season five Civil War on Drugs being one of my favorites.",1377388800,,349,4.833333333333333

4088035,1,B0038M61D2,"I do not recommend this video...  Could not give lower than one star...  I was an avid fan of The Whitest Kids You Know: Season One. The first season had me laughing and entertained skit after skit.  It was a real gem while passing time during deployments.  However, I do not know what happened from then to now.  I saw reviews for season two that were less than par, but the reviews for season three made it seem as if it was a close second to the first season.  I purchased season three in hopes to get a good laugh in here and there but was more than shockingly disappointed.  From the first skit to the end of the second episode I sat in dismay and embarrassment that I had purchased such a horrid display an attempt to be funny and also made someone else sit through it with me.  This DVD is not even worthy to be hidden under the couch where I hide all my old Milli Vanilli CDs (I'd rather eat the cat licked cheeto under there than have someone find it).  At one point of my life I believed that if you added cuss words to anything it made it funny, in this case no....  Cussing only made me angry and was like salty lemon juice in an eye wound.  I will not ask for my money back because I must own up to my mistakes, but I hope with the money I spent that The Whitest Kids You Know can buy a new Joke.  If you want to support a cause just donate your money to the Whitest Kids You Know and save yourself from having to own this DVD.",1347926400,,1440,4.014035087719298

4088039,5,B0038M61D2,"I recieved the DVD in a speedy manner, factory sealed just as promised. no scratches everything looked good. The dvd for some unknown reason was skipping anyway (through no fault of the sender). all i had to do was notify them and they sent a new one along with a pre-pid envelope to send the faulty one back. everything was taken care in a timely and polite manner, so one couldn't expect better :)",1285027200,2,399,4.405405405405405
