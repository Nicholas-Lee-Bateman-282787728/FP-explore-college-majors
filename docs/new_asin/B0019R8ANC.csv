8460390,3,B0019R8ANC,I purchased this DVD with the desire to view and learn OUT of water instruction. The video itself is helpful for water instruction for specific exercises but it does not show the instructor and how she actually teaches the move. This was a huge disappointment for me as I'm in the process of learning the adaptation of moves from deck to water.,1390780800,2,344,4.564516129032258

Relatively clear and good underwater shots, nicely explained and executed. The paperwork with the DVD is very helpful and accommodating. I would recommend it to anyone.",1303084800,5,242,5.230769230769231
