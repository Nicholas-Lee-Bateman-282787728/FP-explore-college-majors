7467128,5,B016BSSJ34,"Paul Hogan plays a small time thief that just got out of prison. He is brilliant with electronics and could make 6 figures a year if he went straight. The problem is he makes that amount for each criminal job he does. He's not a terrible person; he just doesn't know how to go straight.

He is hit by a car when he jumps in front of it to save a little girl. While in the hospital and in his Medically induced haze, he hears Highway to Heaven on TV and believes he is dead and is talking with God.

While trying to rob yet another bank; it is robbed by a group of young punks. The youngest was given blanks because the older ones feared he might manic and shoot someone. Sure enough Paul Hogan, pissed at them for ruining his bank robbery chases after them and the younger on shoots him point blank 5 or 6 times.

Realizing there is no way he could have missed; he now thinks he's an angel and must turn he's life around for being spared; his only to get into Heaven. This starts he's adventure into being a better person.",1455840000,,1022,4.151515151515151

7467132,5,B016BSSJ34,"I'm in awe that Almost an Angel somehow got a Blu Ray release
I still can't believe it
I love this film i have always loved this film! seen it at least 35 times

Almost an Angel is the best Paul Hogan film
it's just so different and smart
Hogan also wrote it (It's better then Crocodile Dundee  imo it's also held up much better too!)
Paul Hogan plays  (Terry Dean)  a small time thief  that just got out of prison he doesn't know how to go straight so he dresses up as Willie Nelson to do a bank job among other things)
he's in no way a terrible man he's jumps in front of a car to save a little girl he actually lives through it.... While in the hospital he hears a tv and believes that the tv is God talking to him
he thinks he's a angel he must turn he's life around for being spared
This starts he's adventure into being a better human being

Linda Kozlowski teams up with Hogan again for this film (by this time i think they were married)
this is without a doubt a great performance by Kozlowski too  she plays Rose Garner
This is a likable grounded in reality character

Elias Koteas plays Steve Garner  (Elias has done everything from Casey Jones in the original TMNT film, to a massive amount of roles) you can see him now on Dick Wolf's Chicago PD in this film he's young and has a head of hair!
this is a great performance by Elias who's is in a wheelchair and paralyzed from the waist down

there are also interesting cameos by
David Alan Grier,
Larry Miller

I'm a negative/cynical person but, I can pick up the message in this film and appreciate what it's trying to say
There's a lot of heart and soul  to this film
It's saying a lot in terms of humanity but, it's not preachy and it doesn't beat you over the head with what it's trying to say
It's not a christian comedy or one of those stupid Kirk Cameron direct to video films
this film gets a 5.4 on IMDB which i don't understand at all
but, War Room gets a 6.1 really...................
I hope it has extras then i will pre-order it super fast  9.4/10",1444867200,3,2021,4.16452442159383
