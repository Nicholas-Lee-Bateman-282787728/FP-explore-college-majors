1847992,4,B00008H2H9,"I bought this DVD for the Anatasia story.  I was okay.  Of course, they couldn't put all the details of what really happened to the family.",1410048000,,139,4.3076923076923075
1847993,5,B00008H2H9,"I loved Amy Irving as Anastasia!! The acting by all cast  members including Claire Bloom met my expectations as one good movie. If you like the story of Tsar Nicolai, the last Tsar to rule Russia. Then this is the movie for you! I have always had an intrest in this mystery. I know they said Anna Anderson DNA did not match. However, the remaining family that inherited the money were real quick to dismiss her as Anastasia. They didn't want to believe she was the real McCoy! And let's not mention the money she would have inherited. I felt so sorry for her. Years later, they said they found the graves of young Anastasia and her younger brother. If the other members of the Tsars family were put into acid why were Anastasia and brother buried far away in dirt graves?",1405641600,2,771,4.429577464788732

1847996,1,B00008H2H9,"What were they thinking? The new adventures is nothing that can be enjoyed by children or adults. The original story is wonderful, but this was such a horrible story with horrible characters, bad acting, and worse puppets. The storyline is unimaginative and tried at worse. We watched it free on demand, and I still feel like I got ripped off. Do not even bother wasting your time.",1235865600,2,381,4.701492537313433

7984467,2,B00008H2H9,"I absolutely enjoyed the first film, but this feels and looks like a cheap TV movie. The fun scenery and high production values of the 1996 flick are long gone. Instead we get a story that doesn't need to be told, bland and silly characters, cheap puppets and a tiny budget. It boggles my mind that this was a theatrical release anywhere in the world.

Skip it.",1466035200,,361,4.388059701492537
