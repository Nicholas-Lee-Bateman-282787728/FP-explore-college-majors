7671801,5,B01C4B7YIS,Terrific. I can't believe I found this set for such a great price. It's NTSC and it is a steal.,1463961600,8,95,3.8
7671802,5,B01C4B7YIS,"First of all-This set is not region 2, or PAL. I do have a separate blu ray player to play region 2 and PAL discs but this set plays just fine on my regular Sony blu ray player. It is NTSC, region 0.

At the time I am writing this review, it is selling for $99. That's $99 for DVDs of 20 plays! That's quite a bargain!

The Globe Theater productions of Shakespeare's works are my favorites. This is the theater layout that Shakespeare wrote his plays to be performed in so seeing them done here is a very unique experience. These plays are seldom performed in this setting anywhere else.

I won't get into each individual play because this review would be the size of the book that is included with this set. The book lists the credits for each production, dates of the performances, a synopsis, and any notes about the particular production.

The packaging is also excellent! Each disc is securely held in one of 4 book-like holders. My copy was shipped from England and not a single disc was knocked loose during shipping. All arrived in perfect condition.

The layout of the Globe Theater has people on the floor standing and some of the action is performed both on the stage and from within the crowd of spectators. This is full participation Shakespeare, which makes it fun.

I haven't watched every play yet but the ones I have watched have all been excellent productions. The filming is also excellent. All around great job on this set! If you like Shakespeare, this set is an essential addition to your collection!",1463011200,4,1522,4.556776556776557

I totally and completely love this release of live plays filmed for dvd. I found the performances to not only be thoroughly enjoyable, but also among some of the best I have seen.
Unfortunately, due to the live nature of these plays, the audio levels sound to me to be inconsistent (like many BBC programs). Dialogue or music played by performers would be suddenly loud at some times, and then incredibly soft and low volume at other times. For this reason I found the use of captions to be incredibly helpful.
Prior to purchasing this set of plays, I had obtained a few titles from this set individually from both Opus Arte and Kultur, but despite the item description's inclusion of ""closed captions"", I found that Kultur's dvd's captioning was not present when I played them on a PS4 (blue-ray player). While Opus Arte editions did have functioning captions. This boxed set of plays performed at London's Globe are from Opus Arte.
Audio issues aside, this boxed set was definitely worth it.",1528934400,,1207,5.631868131868132
8752167,5,B01C4B7YIS,What's more original than The Globe?,1508284800,,36,5.166666666666667
8752168,5,B01C4B7YIS,"Love it! Fantastic footage, you can see close up to the actors' faces as well as some full stage/audience shots. Extremely well done. Excellent resource for teaching Shakespeare or theatre in general. Works on US DVD players with no problem.",1507593600,2,241,5.05
8752169,1,B01C4B7YIS,Boisterously amateurish. The actors violate all Hamlet's advice to the players. The set is interesting for those who cannot imagine what the Globe looked like. Save your money and buy the BBC productions.,1502841600,3,204,5.212121212121212

8752171,5,B01C4B7YIS,"This is NOT PAL. It's region 0, which means it works just about everywhere. Just got mine today (I live in California) and tested it and it plays fine.",1483660800,4,151,4.241379310344827
8752172,5,B01C4B7YIS,"Are you kidding me? Twenty of  Shakespeare's plays performed by Shakespeare's Globe company for $99.81! That is an amazing deal. I've seen some of these productions broadcast at the movie theater, and they are my favorite Shakespeare company.

And as everyone else points out, these are not Region 2 DVDs. They are Region 0 (all regions) and NTSC, designed for worldwide playback.",1477785600,7,380,5.112903225806452
8752173,5,B01C4B7YIS,"These DVDs play just fine on my Sony NTSC blu-ray system here in the USA. This is a wonderful collection. Some plays are not readily available elsewhere. Superb acting, creative sets and lush, rich costumes. The actors often engage the audience directly and the plays seem full....full of real humanity, not stilted and stiff. The performances are bawdy and lively, and the audience is engaged by the performers, sometimes willingly, sometimes not. I have a feeling they are performed much the same way as when Shakespeare was alive. I highly recommend this set.",1477267200,8,562,5.053763440860215
8752174,5,B01C4B7YIS,It was absolutely lovely. The only downside is that it didn't include all of the Shakespeare's works...,1473379200,,103,5.117647058823529
8752175,5,B01C4B7YIS,"This is such an amazing deal for everything you get.
Twenty plays with a full color booklet in three languages (English, French, Spanish.)
The quality is top notch. I have been to the Globe twice and was skeptical about how they would record this.
Where would they put the cameras?
Would it sound any good?
All those concerns were quelled once I put a disk in. These things look and sound amazing! After a few seconds, I forgot I was watching a screen. I felt I was there, that's how good the camera work is. Tons of angles that capture the plays perfectly.
Even though the description says it's only playable in Europe, that's not true. The disks were made region 0 and they say so on each one. They can be enjoyed anywhere.
When you consider paying around 100 bucks for entertainment for the rest of your life, it is beyond a steal.
Highest recommendation.",1471219200,9,858,4.506410256410256
