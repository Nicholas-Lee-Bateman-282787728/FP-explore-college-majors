2690010,1,B000KGGF1C,"Poor quality viewing. I chose this film because it was listed as made in 2012.  Actually, it was transferred to digital (not very well) in 2012, but most likely 30 years old.",1396310400,,174,4.4375
2690011,1,B000KGGF1C,The focus seemed to be unsatisfied desires that took the women out of the covenant and introduced her to pleasure without love,1395273600,,126,4.7727272727272725
2690012,1,B000KGGF1C,"if  your  20 something  ...  this  is  what  your  grand parents  thought  was  racy  and  hot  stuff....
frankly speaking...  its  rather  tame  for  broadcast  television...  and  frankly speaking...you  may  want  to  watch it  as  comidy",1392508800,2,241,5.114285714285714
2690013,4,B000KGGF1C,"A bored suburban housewife(Tammy Latour) turns her stenography service into a thriving prostitution ring, only to lose her husband to the teenage babysitter in this ripped-from-the-headlines sexploitation classic.",1391644800,,213,6.642857142857143
2690014,1,B000KGGF1C,"The sales pitch on this movie was much more interesting than the movie. This is an antique and can not be considered for anything but a ""G"" rating and some sort of ambiguous description.",1389484800,3,186,4.5
2690015,2,B000KGGF1C,weak plot and writing....very poor acting...It lacked a lot and certainly was not worth buying or renting.....You are wasting your time and money watching this story,1378339200,,165,5.384615384615385
2690016,2,B000KGGF1C,"To me, director Joe Sarno is an over-looked master of movie erotcism.
But I'm giving this color study of surburban sin only 2 stars because all the eroticism has been edited out.
There's no nudity, no sex and it could have easily been shown on TV.
In the commentary by Sarno, he said that he deliberately played down naked bodies and sex but added that censorship boards also pitched in to do their own censorship.
To really see what Sarno could do in black and white, check out ""Desire Under the Palms,"" which may not be available yet on DVD.",1276214400,23,543,4.44
2690017,3,B000KGGF1C,"Realizing the film is over 40 years old is the only reason that  I gave it 3 stars. I took into consideration the rules of Society back then. It was pushing the envelope so to speak. I have watched ""Laura's Toys which was recommended by Amazon and there is no comparrison. Laura's Toys is a 4 1/2 and they share nothing in common.",1184889600,,330,4.238095238095238
2690018,4,B000KGGF1C,I will almost certainly get this item - but by itself the cover deserves 4-stars!!It is a perfect duplicate of the house art style of the 60's-70's Beacon and Midwood adult paperbacks (one other film - not adult in quite the same way recently used the same technique) - if the film is nearly as good this will definitely be worth the effort.  This is good advertising for the nostalgia crowd!!,1168646400,2,393,4.535211267605634

8156399,5,B000KGGF1C,"By today's standards, this is some pretty tame stuff. There's no sex, nudity, or F-bombs. But that's not what I watch these older films for. Movies like these are time capsules. They put you in a time & place that are gone forever. And as a time capsule, you could do alot worse than this movie. There's some cool dialogue, beautiful ladies, brain dead husbands, stenographers, dancers, a prostitution racket, & some unintentional humor. I dig this film.",1414368000,7,454,4.833333333333333
