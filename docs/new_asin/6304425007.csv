7872669,5,6304425007,Terrific version of Taming of the Shrew Best I have seen.  Very funny.,1436140800,,70,4.384615384615385
7872670,2,6304425007,"I thought I was getting the BBC-TV series production that I had seen before on library loan. Instead, this is a version made for Canadian television. The bright side is that the actors speak understandably without speed-up. However, part of the reason it is so clear is because the actors are hamming most of the time, overstating every point such that the subtlety and ambiguity is lost. Some of the secondary actors are also not up to the Shakespearean roles. Together, these shortcomings give the performance a sophomoric quality.

I find parts enjoyable but the whole thing is not a pleasant experience. You feel as if you are being talked down to. I think that ""dumbing down"" Shakespeare in order that a general audience may ""understand"" it was the leading idea in the mind of the director/producers. This never really works, but only degrades both actor and audience. To communicate art in these days of a culturally reduced and increasingly illiterate society, one must all the more assume the genius which resides within each person and hope to kindle it. The success rate may be low, but to approach it any other way will always be a failure.

The message of great poetry, drama, and music is a non-literal one. To try to make it comprehensible in a literal fashion, such as by symbol, hamming, or cueing the ""punch lines"" is self-defeating. If you succeed, you fail.",1334361600,2,1376,4.801687763713081
7872671,5,6304425007,"This has to be the closest thing to a PERFECT production of Taming of the shrew you will ever see. As far as I can tell they haven't left out a single line (unlike that AWFUL version with Taylor/Burton which only has ONE THIRD of the original script).
If you're a real shakespeare fan THIS is the version for you.",1284336000,2,313,4.233333333333333
7872672,3,6304425007,"I wish I could give this a higher rating, for it is the best ""Shrew"" I've ever seen.  Len Cariou's performance couldn't be better, and the inclusion of the Induction and material from ""A Shrew"" is delightful.  If only the recording weren't so very bad.  The Stratford, Ontario Festival needs to redo this from the original tapes onto DVD.  Then, it would be a five-star effort.",1213315200,3,377,4.666666666666667
7872673,1,6304425007,"Me and a class of 25 watched this film. Not one of us enjoyed it, why? to much ""oohh""ing, screaming and fighting. Also bad picture quality and old language. I reccomend 10 things I hate about you as it is a modern day film that you won't fall asleep halfway through. Taming of the Shrew was rubbish and I hope that I am never forced to watch the whole thing again.",1105228800,,364,4.140845070422535
7872674,2,6304425007,"If I had bought this for anything less than study purposes, I would be disappointed. The sound, camera work and video quality are so bad that it is hard to judge the quality of the production.",952992000,18,192,4.361111111111111
