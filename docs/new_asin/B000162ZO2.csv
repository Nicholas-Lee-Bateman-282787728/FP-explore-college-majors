8007131,4,B000162ZO2,"I already whined about how short these videos are, even though Sensei Dye does a great job of providing enough info and techniques for the amount of time on this DVD, LOL.

I own ALL three of ""The Aikido Self Defense for the Modern Warrior"" series, and I really enjoy them. A half an hour is just not long enough, but again, 'Sensei Dye' does cover a lot in the short amount of time on each DVD. This DVD focuses on The Techniques of ""Shihonage"" -- The All Direction Throw. As well as the ""Irminnage"" (Entering Throw).  There are so many variations of how you can turn the uke's or oponent's attacks against them. There has to be hundreds (at least) of variations in Shihonage and Irminnage ALONE--which is simply amazing, and the reason why I love this MA so much!!

(Continued) Excerpt From Vol. 1 Review:

I'll eventually be signing up for Aikido classes, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't learn a thing or two while watching this video. Practicing this stuff, is a good thing to get you ready for the dojo, so you'll at least know a little bit about what they are talking about and referring to. Especially if you don't know any even basic Japanese--which I do know a little bit. These DVDs are a great little tool to warm you up, get you going in the right direction... and finally, get ready for the mat. Veteran Aikidokas might really enjoy them, too, anything to help one to polish and perfect their craft.  That's just my personal opinion, though, so take it how you wish.

Anywho... like I said... these DVDs are pretty good and informative, but just so expensive and TOO DARN SHORT!!! It makes me hunger for more, more, more!! Which I'm sure that's exactly what these guys want if they continue to put more volumes out on DVD. This one came out a few years go, so these may be the only three they decide to put out. So........ until I can get to the dojo--being such a busy gal and all--these will remain my guides. I may need to spend a lttle bit more time on youtube, and read, read, read as well LOL!  But soon... it will be time to for me to 'put the belt on.' ;)",1283385600,2,2085,4.303571428571429
8007132,3,B000162ZO2,"Like I said before this is a great instructional video. It's like having the instructor in your house, but nothing like going to the mat yourself and learning hands on. It has the SAME ten minutes introduction with basic instruction of break falls and rolls, as the first.  Biggest disappointment is now your 30 minutes of instruction shrunk to less than 20 minutes of instruction. AND then you get ten minutes of advertisement. I was really hoping to get different advertisements per volume, but no luck.  But in defense they do make it up in the third volume with 40 minutes of instruction.  The instructor knows his stuff.  But is it worth $30 for 20 minutes?",1169683200,,662,4.681034482758621
8007133,5,B000162ZO2,"The quality of the Video is outstanding, I really learned alot.

The techniques here are awesome for today's self-defense. Volume one is great also!!",1169683200,,149,5.208333333333333
