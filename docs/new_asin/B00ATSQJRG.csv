Why not now?

The movie is excellent, but Amazon forces us to provide feedback through reviews (i've never had luck just contacting the seller)",1517529600,,229,4.846153846153846

8557690,4,B00ATSQJRG,"This movie was a little slow and felt very indie, but i enjoyed the slower pace and liked that the majority of it is set in a very small village. It has a true desi feel to it! The humour in it was a little wierd at times but was still funny.

the story follows umi who owes money to a don in london, as punishment the don sends umi back to his home town until he can pay him back.. umi hasn't been back in years so his family is elated to see him and has many questions as to umi's life, which he has to lie lie lie about..... He discovers that his grandfather, who owned the family restaurant has gotten dementia and no longer remembers anyone or the secret recipe to his Chicken Khurana... How is Umi going to get the money without the family business and the famous recipe?? So ofcourse he tries to find it and make it and fails many many times but with the help of his boyhood sweetheart who is currently intended for his brother (which neither seem too thrilled about)

when you finally do find out what the secret ingredient is (yes it is revealed eventually) you will be rolling!!

it's not fast and it's an odd to dry humour but it's well worth a watch!!",1398902400,,1163,4.16

There was no real acting, plot, or story to speak of, and the performances were lackluster, but that's a fault of the script and director. I thought there was one stand-out performance by the Lady Saint---watch for it.

There wasn't even any good singing and dancing which I love in Bollywood films, until the credits rolled, and then it was just so-so.

I give credit for one or two mild plot twists and one very notable image at the end involving, well, birds.

Birds are strange..so are horses....

ANYways! The film kept me out of trouble and unbored for 2 hrs and 16 minutes. I will give the leading man credit for keeping the film going forward in one piece, just by dint of his good looks and Presence. He doesn't really act much but he is definitely the spine of this film somehow.

It's okay to watch but I would never buy it; but I don't actually buy Any movies. I gave it 2.55 stars

8557692,3,B00ATSQJRG,"For a country which has such a fascinating culinary history and an industry which produces the maximum number of films every year there have been surprisingly very few movies about food. I wonder why, aren't filmmakers not inspired by cooking to make films about films. In the 70's, the hindi film hero came home to his mothers Gajar Ka Halwa but besides that no movie made any reference to food. Food is important especially for businesses in the food business- there are some restaurants where people frequent only because the food tastes different- that secret recipe which can never be recreated at home or in other restaurants is the reasons for the restaurant's success.  Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana  tries to be one of the few films that is about food and secret recipes and does a pretty good job.
The story is about failed dreams of Omi Khurana ( Kunal Kapoor) who migrates to London after robbing his own family but finds nothing but a meager existence. He borrows a lot of money from a gangster Shanty ( Manish Mukhija) and since he can't pay it back, he has to return to Lalton, Punjab. His return hinges on the hopes that the thriving restaurant Chicken Khurana back home could be the cure for all his  money troubles. However things have changed, the restaurant has been shuttered, the reason being that the main cook Darji ( Vinod Nagpal) lost his memory and the secret recipe that used to Chicken Khurana.
LSTCK is a simple film that will most likely entertain you. It may have sections that are not engaging but everything comes together at the end. Kunal Kapoor is great and so is Harman ( Huma Qureshi) the doctor. Rajesh Sharma ( Titu Mama) was the best, taking the film to new highs every time he appears. Four stars. 5/20/2013",1369872000,,1749,4.635483870967742
8557693,2,B00ATSQJRG,"The story is not over-the-top. Instead, it's staged in a dusty village and shows everyday Indians (except for the loutish gangsters). But the script is so unrealistic that I couldn't enjoy the acting. The love matches show no affection and the main character is mean, but still his family and a beautiful lady doctor do accept him. When they have to be silent, some actors simply show a very empty face, especially so leading man Kunal Kapoor who sleep-walks apathically through most of the flick.

There is little humour. Maybe the numerous farts in the first part were written to make up for that. The music has some Punjab beats (as you demand from a movie set in rural Punjab), but most instruments seem to be electronic so that the sound is very artificial.

I'd love to love Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana (2012), what with its low-budget-charme and the simple village life; but the movie lacks so much in several departments. On a positive note, even though we see a journey from London to Punjab, there are no yellow flowering mustard fields - maybe a first in Hindi cinema history? (Director Sameer Sharma was assistant on Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, the quintessential London-Punjab flick of 1995.) But anyway, South Indians do better rural movies, especially in Kerala, or you ask Shyam Benegal.

My take: The script is contrived and humourless, the crime action without reason and the soul drama implausible, lame and filmi with an un-filmi staging.",1361923200,,1460,4.879032258064516
