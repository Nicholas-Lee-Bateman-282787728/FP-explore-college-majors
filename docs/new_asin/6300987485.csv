302332,5,6300987485,"This 1939 classic; a remake of the 1926 film of the same name and starring (Ronald Coleman) and which runs about 11 minutes longer is  superior by far! Abundant adventure and action..the ultimate Legion Classic. It captures the adventure genre as well as anything ever put to celluloid! It has lost none of its allure since I first saw it as a child thirty odd years ago! The three lead roles;Gary Cooper(Beau Geste), Ray Milland( John), and Robert Preston (Digby) are a casting coup which makes this work. Based on the 1924 novel written by P.C.Wren and adapted to the screen, is far and away the best version! Why a lack-lustre 1966 version with Telly Savalas and Dean Stockwell ever made it into print is beyond me! This authentic and detailed description of the Foreign Legion before 1914 has led some to believe that Wren may even have served with that particular regiment..yet to be proven though. Honor,is the prevailing theme throughout this film;the driving force which motivates the theft of the 'Blue Water'diamond by Beau Geste, influenced also with the elements of courage and heroism which round it out. Accompanied by a terrific music score by Alfred Newman(who was no slouch with 45 Academy Award nominations to his credit!)the atmosphere of the film is robust and rousing...I can even feel the desert sand in my shoes!! Stealing the, 'Blue Water'diamond, heading off to join the Foreign Legion in the Sahara Desert,Fort Zinderneuf, trained by  sadistic sergeant'Markoff',effectively played with sinister conviction by (Brian Donlevy), battles with Arabs, brotherly comraderie, chemistry, music, and a touch of mystery to boot!!...all these elements provide us with a film that begs to be veiwed by a new generation, and veiwed in the medium that its long over-due dvd release will provide!! Let that bugle blow!!!",1199404800,2,1830,5.076411960132891
302333,5,6300987485,"Intriguing from the start, this adventure begins at the end of the story, with a foreign legion troop arriving to reinforce a fort in the desert, to find it defended by dead men.  How it got that way unfolds in a flashback story of the three adopted Geste Brothers played by

Gary Cooper (Sgt. York), Ray Milland (Panic In Year Zero), and Robert Preston (The Music Man, in a very early role here) who join the French Foreign Legion after a valuable jewel is stolen from their adoptive family.

The terrific supporting cast includes Susan Hayward as Ray Milland's girlfriend; Donald O'Connor (Singin' In The Rain) as young Beau Geste, one of his earliest roles (he also played Huckleberry Finn); Brian Donlevy (The Quatermass Xperiment) as a sadistically strict sergeant; J. Carrol Naish, Broderick Crawford (All The King's Men), and Albert Dekker (Dr. Cyclops) as legionaires.",1178496000,2,876,4.986301369863014
302334,3,6300987485,"there seemed to be a fascination with placing trios of men in this type of setting back in the 1930s; this is a bit better than ""lives of a bengal lancer"" (my review forthcoming) but its not in the league with the best of the ilk ""gunga din"". still, it is a grand adventure with gary cooper, ray milland, and robert preston involved in a tale of jewel thievery and high desert adventure with the foreign legion. still, even with those 3 wonderful hams, it is brian donlevy who steals the show in one of those performances that so make 1930s movies worth watching. fun.",1176854400,4,568,4.419047619047619

Unconditional love...It shows if pushed you would steal to support your family....you would take the blame for things you believe people you love did to save them....you would risk your life to safe your family

On the flip side, you are shown.....jealousy, greed, cruelty

A Movie with Love, Mystery, Comedy, and Adventure.....what could top it!

302338,5,6300987485,"Beau Geste is one of my favourites, it has everything you need to have a perfect story Gary Cooper and Ray Milland and Robert Preston act perfectly as Beau Geste has laughter and sadness and it is a film you can watch time after time Beau Geste is cleverly written as each event happens. This galent novel is charming because each small sentance makes you want to see more!

As I said Beau Geste is fantasticly wrote and I enjoy seeing each part as it comes!",1098057600,6,458,4.325581395348837
302339,4,6300987485,"Beau Geste, a melodramatic 1939 period piece depicts the comradery of three brothers during Victorian times.  It falls short of a 5 star rating as it lacks the high degree of drama seen in similar type classics such as Gunga Din and Four Feathers.
The wholesome Gary Cooper along with Robert Preston and Ray Milland play three brothers, Beau, Digby and John Geste, adopted into the affluent baronial lifestyle of English Lord and Lady Brandon.  When the lord threatens to sell the family's most precious possession, the Blue Water, a huge cerulean sapphire, to finance his gambling, one of the brothers absconds with it.  In a chivalrous gesture the three brothers flee and enlist in the French Foreign Legion and get shipped to North Africa.
While in the foreign legion they are cruelly commanded by star of the movie Brian Donlevy, who plays the facially scarred, sadistic heavy Sergeant Markoff.  The brothers strive to survive the elements, the Arabs and Markoff while they protect the secret of the prized sapphire.
The flick is hopelessly dated but still remains hugely entertaining to a classic movie buff.  A youthful and ravishing Susan Hayward plays Milland's love interest, Isobel Rivers, a ward of Lady Brandon in one of her earliest starring roles.",1075248000,35,1261,5.014354066985646
302340,5,6300987485,"This classic movie holds up pretty well to the basic storyline of Wren's novel.  A few subtle changes have been made because no movie can ever reproduce a book perfectly, but everything has been done faithfully to the spirit of the original story.  Readers of the book will find that the evil sarjeant is named Markov in the movie as opposed to Lajeaune in the book.  The name sounds more evil perhaps!  A few  minor quibbles I have with the movie is that it has that 1930s Hollywood feel to it, in terms of the acting and characterizations.  It would have been nice to have heard French commands in the Legion as opposed to flat American voices.  Later Foreign Legion movies like ""March or Die"" provide this kind of detail which this classic lacks.  Also, in the attacks on the fort the Arabs look foolish charging with cavalry against walls that are too high.  In the book the fort's walls are described as being lower so that someone climbing up from a camel's back could almost succeed with an escalade.  In the book John, Digby and their two American friends wander in the desert in Arab guise for several years.  This is rather condensed in the film.  The impossible shot that kills Digby from horse-back is more realistically described in the book where John relays that the Arab fired from his horse at 30 feet striking Digby as he played his bugle. A more realistic scenerio I find. Of course these are minor quibbles, none of which detract from the beauty and haunting nature of the movie.  The music is also striking, in particular the opening scene when we see the dead Legioners manning the fort's walls.  That scene is probably one of the most haunting in all movies, and conveys so much without being overly graphic.  This is probably the best Foreign Legion movie that will ever be made. All since have been based on it.  Since Four Feathers has recently survived another re-make I wonder if Beau Geste is due for another attempt?  Arabs, sand and desert battles seem to be compelling these days.  I wonder why?",1034294400,19,2027,4.598885793871866
302341,5,6300987485,"""Beau Geste"" is a magnificent adventure story for any age group and the 1939 version, Mr. Maltin's opinion not withstanding, is probably the best version of this tale I have ever seen.  The cast is top-notch and  the action never wavers.  This is a film that I grew up with and it is one  that can withstand the years.

The film begins somewhere around 1910, with a company of French Foreign Legion approaching an isolated fort in the middle of Sahara desert. They come to assist the garrison, besieged by bellicose nomads - but the siege appears to have ended, as there is no more fighting. But once the fort is reached the commanding officer discovers a puzzling mystery... Then, we move 15 years back, to England, in the end of XIX century, where we meet three young boys, orphaned brothers Geste: Michael, John and Digby. Michael is the oldest, the most clever, the fiercest and even at this tender age already stunningly handsome - everybody calls him ""Beau"". They are raised by Lady Brandon, a kind hearted woman whose husband is absent and very busy spending whatever is left of the family fortune. One of the few things left, other than the heavily mortgaged lands and mansion, is a legendary jewel, ""Blue Water"" sapphire, greatly desired by many... And then the film really begins.

Adapted from a very popular novel written in 1924, this is the story of mystery, great hardships, great tragedies, brotherly love - but above everything else one very, very noble sacrifce, a beautiful gesture indeed - ""beau geste"" means precisely that in French. I liked the story a lot.

Michael, played by Gary Cooper, is of course the main character and the main positive hero, but this film wouldn't be half as good without two other characters. The mightiest and the most fascinating is Sergeant Markoff, played incredibly by Brian Donlevy, who was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Markoff is one of the most incredible soldiers I ever saw on screen. He is portrayed as a villain but in fact we must wait a very, very long time in the film before we see him committing something really villainous - on another hand he is an AMAZING war time leader! He is assisted by a clearly despicable villainous sidekick, Rasinoff - played incredibly by J. Carrol Naish. Markoff calls Rasinoff ""human jackal"" and it is the best description of this man, but still, he has his own story to tell. The complexity of those two ""bad guys"" makes this film much more interesting than one could expect.

I am absolutely certain that this film inspired parts of Paul Verhoeven ""Starship Troopers"". The siege of the desert fort on planet ""P"" and the character of Lt. Jean Raschak are so much similar in general lines to the siege of the fort by desert nomads and to some extent to that of Markoff that it simply cannot be a coincidence. There even is a tower in the desert fort which is a place for the ""forlorn hope"" soldiers, exactly like those two guys manning the heavy machine guns on the tower during the siege of the outpost on the planet ""P"". This feeling of familiarity certainly helped me enjoy this film.

The scenario is solid, good guys are good, villains are FASCINATING, the main battle is amazing and the final revelation of the sense of the whole mystery is very moving. Also, once you watched this film, you will be able to appreciate much better the ""Last remake of Beau Geste"" a comedy made in the 70s with Michael York and Marty Feldman, which is in itself a good watch, but once you know the real ""Beau Geste"", well, it becomes irresistible.

I am very glad that I watched this film and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1446249600,,3523,4.637820512820513

303204,3,6300987485,"A so-called classic film from that magical Hollywood year - 1939 - starring Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston and Directed by William (Ben-Hur) Wyler.
I finely saw this film - straight through - for the first time recently. I found the so-so screenplay abundant with plot holes. It was filmed nearly as a shot for shot remake of the 1926 silent version, which explains the films story-line holes and continuity problems. I'm sure this particular story worked better in the silent era because audiences were a lot more forgiving of contrived story lines and under developed characters  before the inception of ""talkies"".
I will not give the story away by explaining the plot holes but I will say it does vary slightly from the book written in 1924. Suffice it to say this movie has been way over rated, in my opinion, and evidently other people must agree because it was remade twice after this version.
Beau Geste was wonderfully filmed and acted by the three leads but was in need of a script Doctor to fix the obvious plot holes and devices, wooden supporting characters, conspicuously missing characters and standard movie villains.",1441584000,,1145,4.871794871794871

In all honesty, `Beau Geste' is one of the best films I've ever seen.  It is endearing and unforgettable, a film that will suck you in from the very first sequence and truly startle your every sense as it takes you on a beautiful journey through the lives of three brothers.

`Beau Geste' tells the story of three orphan boys, Michael, John and Digby, who are taken in by their Aunt Patricia.  The boys are the usual, adventurous type, and they most certainly have a bond that runs deeper than most boys (a bond that is born in the face of adversity).  They boys also have companions in young Isobel, another child Aunt Patricia took heart to adopt, as well as Augustus; Patricia's spoiled son.  Flash forward to adulthood and the boys see that they are falling on hard times.  Patricia has taken it upon herself to see to the children's wellbeing, but it has exhausted her financially and put her in a desperate situation where she is contemplating selling off a precious heirloom, the Blue Water sapphire.  Before she can actually carry that out though, the sapphire mysteriously disappears.

Seemingly to run away from the act, the three boys find themselves enlisting in the Foreign Legion, a goal of theirs since childhood.  It is in the evil clutches of Sgt. Markoff that the boys next find themselves; and what comes next is unforgettable.

Very few films can actually meld together the maturity of an adult drama with the pure joyfulness of a childish adventure quite like `Beau Geste'.  Every element comes together marvelously; glistening in tone and creating a near perfect (or dare I say `PERFECT') cinematic experience.  The actors are all on point, especially Robert Preston, who just charms and delights as Digby Geste.  With a commanding presence and a lasting impression, `Beau Geste' is marvelous entertainment for all that has all the elements of a Hollywood blockbuster (action, adventure, drama, romance and wit) but actually understands how to make them all fit together beautifully.

It is perfectly balanced, from start to finish.",1309996800,,2086,4.92

Brian Donlevy is pure evil and quite good in the role of the bad Sgt., Cooper does a great job and Preston and Milland are solid.  The supporting cast is very strong with some faces you know and others you don't but they add much to the film.

303506,4,6300987485,"""Beau Geste"", (the 1939 film version)  is a charming adventure focused on the brothers Geste.  It has mystery and adventure packed into a film full of famous former stars. The film starts by showing the three Geste brothers growing up and being raised as adopted wards by a kindly upper-crust English woman, Lady Patricia Brandon (Heather Thatcher)  The estate is called Brandon Abbas,  and has room to wander and play, with scenic views and a castle-like home.  Lady Patricia has  also adopted a young girl named Isobel Rivers (Ann Gillis as a child) and raises her own son Augustus (""Gussie"") Brandon (David Holt as a child).  The boys like to play soldier and have toy sailing ships firing at each other on a pond  The young boys make-believe a Viking funeral .  John asks that his brothers remember that he wishes to be treated like a Viking when he dies.  They set the toy ship on fire with a dog at the sailor's feet, like a Viking.  They remember John's wish..

Lady Brandon has spent most of the estate on raising the children and upkeep.  Her  remaining fortune is based upon the possession of a family jewel and heirloom, a magnificent sapphire called the ""Blue Water.""  She has kept this in secret hiding area like a mother hen.  It is a mysterious room behind the fireplace.  She notes to a friend that this is where Catholic priests were hidden to escape Cromwell's persecution.  Soon she gets a note from her no-good husband, Sir Hector Brandon, that he has spent the entire family fortune.  He has gambled away everything.  The valuable stone is worth 30,000 pounds.

As a child, Beu is playing a game and in a Knight's Armour when he overhears his Aunt Patricia has sold the valuable gem to an Arab to pay for the children's education.  Many twists and turns ensue.

The film then shows the children have grown up to handsome adults.  The stars are now:

  Beau (Gary Cooper)

  Digby (Robert Preston)

Overall the story  is a bit melodramatic, and promotes the virtues of trust, self-sacrifice, loyalty and patriotic honor.  The mystery of the missing ""Blue Water"" is also very intriguing.",1287187200,4,2186,4.735294117647059

But, who could ever forget the portrayal of one of the meanest characters on the screen, by Brian Donlevy. Excellent.",1277337600,,287,4.647058823529412
303549,4,6300987485,"The most famous of the many adaptations of P.C. Wren's 1924 adventure novel of jewel thievery and life in the foreign legion, with a fairly spectacular cast consisting of Gary Cooper in the title role, Robert Preston and Ray Milland as his younger brothers Digby and John, Susan Hayward as Isobel, the ward of Lady Brandon who brought the orphaned brothers up, and Brian Donlevy as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff.  I saw this years and years ago and remembered very little of it except for Donlevy's imposing performance, and the long, long battle sequence involving the besieged For Zinderneuf that is the climax of the film.

And those are the most memorable elements, I think.  The rest of the cast is good, and the simple storyline (three orphaned brothers grow up in a once-wealthy household; suspects in the theft of an immense sapphire that is the last wealth in the family, they all leave to join the French Foreign Legion, and struggle to survive under the sadistic sergeant and the Tuareg hordes) is well told.  Wellman's camerawork is very assured, the sets are terrific, Alfred Newman's music is stirring, but...there's a bit of drag in the middle I think.  Hayward is barely used as there is little development in the early-adulthood passage just before the jewel theft, thus the romantic angle is hardly exploited - on the other hand the army barracks sequence makes up roughly half the film.  I suppose this does serve get across the theme of brotherhood - and to get across the vindictiveness and pettiness of Donlevy's brutal sergeant, but with characters so readily delineated and relatively simple in their motivations, I think it just gets to be a bit too much, like the film is striving to be an ""epic"" where it doesn't - except for the long concluding battle sequence - really feel like one.  Not a huge fault at all, but enough to keep it from the very top ranks of adventure films from this era as far as I'm concerned - though I'd certainly recommend this to lovers of the period adventure, I'd personally pick THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, LOST HORIZON, THE FOUR FEATHERS, or THE THIEF OF BAGDAD as the best representations of the genre as a whole.

Supposedly an almost scene-for-scene remake of the 1926 film with Ronald Colman in the title role; this was also remade again in 1966 with Tell Savalas in the equivalent of Donlevy's role, and Guy Stockwell as Beau.  Finally there was a 1982 BBC miniseries that is presumably the closest adaptation of the novel.  And there have been several parodies.  Donlevy was nominated for an Oscar for this and well deserved to be, though he lost out to Thomas Mitchell in what was certainly a career year for that actor, who appeared in just about every major, well-remembered 1939 American film except for this one.

The Universal DVD is no great shakes with minimal extras but nothing to complain about in the sound or picture areas either.",1264118400,2,2908,4.748015873015873
303550,5,6300987485,"In the Saharan desert sits an oasis and a fort surrounded by a sea of sand.

The oasis offers its visitors protection from the desert: palms shade you from the hot equatorial sun, low barriers block the wind-blown sand from stinging your eyes, and a sip from its cool blue water can wet your parched tongue.

The fort offers its men protection from attack of the human kind, but in this case, these men no longer need protection because they are all dead, or are they?

Reinforcements arrive too late; they find only the dead defend the fort.  But then, two shots are fired from the fort, one of the Major's men disappears, and two of the dead disappear.  Before he could solve these mysteries, they come under attack and they only have time to run for cover in the oasis.  The situation is dire and Major de Beaujolais sends two men for more reinforcements.

Life is not easy in the Foreign Legion.  Who would want to join?  Legend has it, that if you are a thief, murderer, or just want a place to hide, and you are looking for a little adventure at the same time, the Foreign Legion is for you.

The Geste brothers have always had a thirst to join the Foreign Legion and when a famous jewel vanishes in their presence and the police are about to be called, Beau, Digby, and John vanish as well.

Strangest scene:  The troops are planning a mutiny.  Sergeant Markoff learns of the plan, and he and several loyal men enter the barracks at night, wake up the mutineers, and march them outside into broad daylight!

Picture: good.  No cropping.  Sound: good.  Volume: normal.",1258675200,,1574,4.485915492957746

303552,5,6300987485,"Finally, BEAU GESTE has been released on DVD. Previously it was only available as part of the GARY COOPER COLLECTION with four other Gary Cooper movies.

Gary Cooper plays Beau, one of three orphaned Geste brothers raised by their aunt at Brandon Abbas estate.  The male head of the household seems to be always away drinking and gambling away the family fortune.  After he sends a telegram directing that the family jewel, the Blue Water sapphire, is to be sold to finance his activities, the sapphire is stolen.  When Beau disappears shortly after the theft, suspicion naturally falls on him.

Beau flees to the French Foreign Legion and ends up stationed at a fort in the North African desert.  It isn't long before his two brothers join him.

Brian Donlevy plays a Foreign Legion sergeant whose cruelty sparks a mutiny that the Geste brothers refuse to join.

I won't say anymore lest I spoil the film for those who haven't seen it before, except to say thay BEAU GESTE is certainly one of Gary Cooper's best and one of my all time favorites.",1251504000,,1046,4.6775956284153
303553,5,6300987485,"It is the general consensus that 1939 was ""the year"" for Tinseltown. It cranked out some of the greatest films, GONE WITH THE WIND, THE WIZARD OF OZ, DARK VICTORY to name just a few.

Beau Geste is the first talkie version and the ultimate classic, directed by William Wellman and boasts a wonderful cast including Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, and in her first major studio role, superstar Susan Hayward in a small part. Hayward would later team with all the leads in another picture (3 with Preston).

The story of orphan boys who join the foreign legion is classic. Watch for Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper as the Aunt. The desert scenes are spectacular. The story revolves around a gem ""The Blue Water"" and which one of the boys stole it?

This is Hollywood at it's best. A special tribute to this year has been produced by Turner Classic Movies, I can only assume how terribly difficult it was for the Academy Awards to choose best picture nominees in 1939 (although it was a cinch ""Gone With The Wind"" would sweep the awards); however, so many great films were made and Beau Geste ranks among one of them.

I won't go into further plot details. Just watch the movie and catch a very young and upcoming Susan Hayward hone her remarkable acting talent that would lead her to winning almost every major award possible.",1247702400,4,1335,4.6440677966101696
303554,5,6300987485,"Since 1926, there have been three Beau Geste films, plus one TV miniseries and a Marty Feldman spoof called THE LAST REMAKE OF BEAU GESTE (1977). It's not as amusing as the latter, yet the 1939 PARAMOUNT edition of ""Beau""  is far and away the finest of the lot.

William Wellman's picture (loosely based on the 1924 P.C. Wren novel) is in part a who-dun-it but primarily an adventure yarn. The story begins with all the men stationed at a desert fort lying dead from combat. A letter confessing to a crime is found on the body of one of them.

Flashback to Michael (""Beau"") and his brothers as children (Beau is portrayed by 12-year-old Donald O'Connor). The three orphaned Gestes and Isabel Rivers were adopted when very young by the boys' aunt, Lady Patricia Brandon. They all live at Brandon Abbas with Aunt Pat and her son Augustus.

In raising the four adoptees, Aunt Pat exhausts her estate's finances. To pay debts she determines to sell a family heirloom, the Blue Water sapphire but first Pat shows it to all for the last time. The lights suddenly go out and when they're restored, it's discovered that Lady Brandon's precious gem has vanished. Suspicion falls on the three Gestes, so the young men join the French Foreign Legion to escape accusations or embarrassment.

The Saharan portion of this film is the lion's share. We meet several members of the Gestes' outpost. Later attacks by Arabs make it clear that their fort is doomed-- the only question is when all will die. The Legionnaires' valiant struggle against daunting odds is one you won't soon forget. A great cast, story and cinematography make this Beau Geste a genuine classic, and one of the best films of that superlative year of 1939.

When a valuable diamond disappears the boys join the Foreign Legion and fight the Arabs in North Africa. Part mystery, part action adventure/war movie this movie is well worth viewing.

303556,5,6300987485,"This is an action-filled movie that gains momentum when the three brothers leave their family and join the French Foreign Legion together in a wave of disgust over their father's weaknesses. The brotherly affection and loyalty is the main theme of the story, and it is touching and heartrending without being overly sentimental. Cooper, Milland, Hayward and Donleavy are brilliant. It was, is, and always will be a great film about true nobility of the heart as opposed to nobility of the blood.",1223078400,,495,4.975903614457831

One is accused of stealing and to avoid prosecution they all leave home and join up. Lots of action. It is nice to see movies without bad words, sex scenes, and movies enhanced by computers. There is just great character development, and you end up caring for all three, and eventually find out why there was no theft in the first place.",1199664000,,487,4.48314606741573
