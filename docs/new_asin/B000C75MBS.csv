8096153,5,B000C75MBS,"World War II drama directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, and one of his definite masterpieces. The film is based on an unfinished novel of Mikhail Sholokhov, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature. Bondarchuk is better known in the West for his epic production of Tolstoy's War and Peace, a film that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. His other credits also include 1970's Waterloo produced by Dino De Laurentiis. This was his first English language film with Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon Bonaparte, Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington and Orson Welles as Louis XVIII of France.",1348185600,3,622,4.877358490566038
8096154,2,B000C75MBS,"Amazon has two listings for this DVD.  I have this version, which has the English language titles on the DVD case.  Amazon has the reviews for these two DVDs separated, and so I've posted essentially the same review for both listings.

This movie is basically a Soviet version of American Hollywood style war movies and TV shows, such as the ""Combat"" TV series, in which a gigantic war fought across an enormous landmass is coned down to the field of view of a small infantry unit. The storyline follows a group of foot soldiers as they do a fighting retreat towards Stalingrad, finally crossing the Don River at the end. Stalingrad never appears in this movie, and the scenes are all in the countryside.

There are a few scenes of battle, mostly of German tanks accompanied by Panzergrenadier charging across the open steppe, as well as episodes of artillery shelling and ground attacks on the Soviet soldiers by German aircraft. Close observation of the German tanks in the movie reveal them to be dressed up T-34s, made to look somewhat like the 75mm Pzkpfw IVs that had started to appear in the spring of 1942, shortly before the Battle of Stalingrad (the main gun barrels are a bit too long to be the PZkpfw III or early model Pzkpfw IVs, which would have still been more common during that time period). The turrets on these German tanks have the odd and defining angled undercut panels at the front corners, and the hulls have a flat, squared off superstructure that disguise the normal sloped armor of the T-34. But the very forward placement of the turrets and the large roadwheels with slack tracks instead of return rollers on top confirm that these could only be T-34s in disguise.

On the Soviet side, no Soviet tanks or Soviet aircraft appear. By this time period (summer of 1942, it looks like), the Soviet air force had recovered, and production of the T-34 and KV-1 tanks had escalated, and so it is disappointing not to see these Soviet war machines depicted. The single shot PTRD anti-tank rifle is much in evidence as the movie's main character is part of a two-man anti-tank team. The absence of the characteristic large muzzle blast and recoil when this gun was fired is not too realistic however. The effectiveness of the PTRD is also a bit exaggerated, as it could at most only penetrate the side armor of German tanks, and the attacks on the Soviet troop positions were all depicted as frontal confrontations. The classic PPSh drum fed sub-machine gun, the Mosin-Nagent bolt action rifle, and the Degtyaryov machine gun all appear in this movie. Soviet anti-tank field artillery also appear.

So, being a WWII buff, it was somewhat interesting to see the weaponry depicted in this Soviet film. Similar to Hollywood WWII movies, German soldiers are depicted carrying the obligatory ""Schmeisser"" MP-40 sub-machine gun, although these were not that common in the Wehrmacht.

The English translation soundtrack was surprisingly good which had the weird quality of making this movie seem even more like a US-made ""Combat"" episode when viewed with the English soundtrack turned on.

But in truth, the Soviet-German war was totally different from war on the Western Front. It was a far fiercer and more brutal war where atrocities were commonplace. The rigidity and brutality of the Soviet Army against its own soldiers is completely ignored in this movie. It would not at all be unfair to say that Soviet soldiers suffered almost as much from the incompetence and brutality of their own government as they did from the Germans. Soviet commissars were an integral part of every Red Army unit, working alongside the regular Army command structure to ensure loyalty and mete out punishment for failure. Failure in a battle assignment frequently meant being sent to a punishment battalion which were then given lethal assignments (e.g. human wave attacks through minefields, to clear out the mines for the regular Army troops that followed).

In the pre-Stalingrad period of time depicted in this movie, morale among Soviet soldiers was terrible, and desertions and mass surrenders common. Many Soviet POWs went to work as laborers for the Germans (the Hiwis), some even fought for the Germans (Vlasov's Russian Liberation Army). NKVD punishment squads carried out large numbers of death penalties for the Soviet deserters that were caught. None of this reality (now well-documented by many historians and post-Soviet Union memoirs of Soviet soldiers) appears in this movie.

So all in all, it was mildly interesting to see a Soviet-era film about small unit infantry combat, made in the style of a Hollywood war movie. But the movie is fatally flawed by its Soviet era intention to create an ode to the Soviet soldier, while totally ignoring the truths of the horrendous Soviet-German conflict.",1294012800,4,4810,4.941831683168317
8096155,3,B000C75MBS,"There's a single cemetery in St. Petersburg Russia (by the name of Piskariovskoye) where over 500,000 Russian World War II dead are buried. Mostly civilians caught in the Siege of Leningrad rest there now, but among the dead are thousands of the defenders of the environs of St. Petersburg (then called Leningrad). ""They Fought for their Motherland"" is the story of such soldiers, in particular the soldiers forced into full retreat (thanks to Stalin's refusal to heed warnings of Hitler's then imminent invasion & prepare for such) before being able to make a stand anywhere.  Countless lives thus were needlessly sacrificed by 'Marshall' Stalin. You can't not think of such lives lost when watching this film.  As an officer, speaking of the initial collapse of the Soviet army upon Hitler's invasion, says in this film: ""We have nothing to be ashamed of when we look our people in the eye."" ""We were retreating, my sons,"" another soldier laments, as they bury their last officer in their regiment, ""but everyone knows how hard we resisted and at how high a cost."" And that's what this film (adapted from Mikhail Sholokhov's eponymously named novel) is all about. It's a simple salute to Soviet soldiers, or rather Russians fighting to depend Russia (as communism is mentioned I think once herein and Stalin NOT AT ALL!) Over this film's 2 hours and 16 minutes we see little other than that which is evinced by this soldier's comment: ""It's pull back, pull back. When do we stop pulling back?"" ""If we get across that damn river, then we may be safe,"" another Russian soldier later says in this Soviet made film which is set in July of 1942.  Yes, during the entire film the Russians are on the defensive & the first 36 minutes or so are particularly lazy and quiet as the above takes place.  Oddly though we don't see much of the enemy's face even later on either.  German tanks keep attacking the retreating Russians, German planes too, but German soldiers' faces don't figure prominently in this film; only a few close-ups of Germans are even shown. Nothing is said why the Germans invaded (totally ignoring Stalin's previous pact with Hitler), and nothing why Stalin did nothing to prepare for this attack we know that he was warned was coming. The film's simple message is we were attacked. We don't see a single Soviet tank (nor plane to the best of my recollection). Battle scenes are not that numerous actually anyway, as the director focuses on individual Soviet soldiers. He continually beats the drum, in the words of a local party chairman in the middle of nowhere, that ""these boys aren't cowards, they're heroes."" That's the message of this piece of self-promotion/historical fudging, for it's not much of a film per se. There's no real story; no background is provided; no point is presented---which is apropo, in a way actually, because at the end of the film a soldier embraces and kisses a Soviet flag and we are supposed thus to believe that that solely was what they were fighting and dying for...totally ignoring the real appeals during WWII for ""Soviets"" to fight for Mother Russia and the Orthodox faith (which Stalin had been previously trying to strangle to extinction).
