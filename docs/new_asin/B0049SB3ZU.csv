Considering Bruce nor his family are getting a dime of this EXTREMELY overpriced 6 disc set, I have to shake my finger for shame!!!",1381536000,3,173,4.4375
8419251,5,B0049SB3ZU,"Though Fortune Star tends to scrimp on the extras (commentary, analysis, background, etc.), they usually put out a good product.  Fortune Star's blu-ray discs are a sore point with some consumers, and I must acknowledge the Enter the Dragon disc in this set is clearly inferior to the Warner Bros. 40th Anniversary blu-ray release.  However, the Fortune Star edition in this box set is the Asian release of Enter the Dragon, with different opening credits and slightly longer running time, which might appeal to some. From attractive packaging to good blu-ray disc exposition, this is an outstanding presentation of Bruce Lee's film work.",1376697600,3,638,5.184466019417476
8419252,4,B0049SB3ZU,"Great collection, I haven't watched Game of Death or Tower of Death yet, but so far so good, except for the fact that Enter the Dragon doesn't have any english audio (which is the actual audio of the film, you're better off buying the Enter the Dragon bluray on it's own, which is in english and has plenty more special features."" This collection actually comes with 6 blu-rays and 2 bonus DVDs.",1331856000,15,395,4.5
