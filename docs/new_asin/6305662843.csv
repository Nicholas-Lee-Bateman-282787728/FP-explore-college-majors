7892571,2,6305662843,"Part of the reason why I like this movie is because I expected it to be terrible.  I had never seen a Master P film before, so my expectations were VERY, VERY low.  However, it was not quite as bad as I expected.  Gary Daniels is the main star of the film, despite the fact that he gets far less credit than he deserves.  Don't see this movie for its plot, acting, or direction.  The ONLY reason to see this movie is for some of the action sequences.  I was disappointed becaus Gary Daniels is an excellent martial artist, yet he displays no martial arts skill in this film.  However, there are some other entertaining action sequences to view.  Within the first 10 minutes, there is a nice action scene involving a flamethrower and a rocket launcher.  The next good action scene comes halfway through the film, where one character fills an office building with bullets.  This scene is done in a very John Woo-type fashion, with lots of slow-motion, and the use of dual golden pistols (just like Nicolas Cage's guns in Face/Off).  These two action scenes are the reason to see this movie.  Otherwise, this movie should be avoided at all costs.  I gave this film its 2 stars for those 2 action scenes, and because it turned out to be better than I expected (then again, I had the lowest expectations possible).",1009411200,2,1309,4.519148936170213
7892572,1,6305662843,"The  star of this movie is Gary Daniels. He is the only actor in all of the scenes. For some reason his name was omitted from the title which has three very minor charicters.
 With that said this movie has no fight scenes dispite starring several brilliant martial atists. It is about a man who is coaxed into  swiching numbers around for a secret agency for fast money. when things get tough for the big boys he shows them how he can save the say with quick thinking and no fists.  I think about the first 30 minutes had okay writing and the rest of the movie was sloppy first draft type material. For instance, three times in the movie the whole plot is stopped to show a rap music video that has no relivance to anything going on. they could just as well have played parts of steamboat willy for a minute at a time. there was potential in this movie as a fighting type,(gary daniels is the greatest martial artist and they wasted him) but there were too many twists that they wanted to fit in and nothing was given proper timeing or effort. the actors were good but they were all given very weak charicters to work with. I have more sypathy for the actors than anger.
Do not buy this movie. let it just rest in our hearts as one of the tortures that good acters must endure to make it in this world",971481600,3,1301,4.233870967741935
