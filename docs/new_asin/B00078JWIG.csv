I've bought a bunch of disks in order to help my parents deal with my little brother and this is in the top five of the ones I've gotten. While not appropritate to my situation there is also a great clip here on what girls should expect on dates and how they should behave if they do not want to get into trouble. All and all this is the type of disk that would help families to watch together.",1148428800,,609,4.258620689655173
