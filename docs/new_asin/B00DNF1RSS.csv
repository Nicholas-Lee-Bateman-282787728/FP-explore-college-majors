5835512,4,B00DNF1RSS,"No veo la hora de que llegue la Fecha para Comprar este DVD. Tengo muchisimas ganas de ver esta Telenovela.
Espero que el Resumen valga la pena.
29/9/2013: Tuve la oportunidad de Comprar el DVD En Mxico, la Edicin Mexicana, 1 mes y medio antes de que salga a la Venta En USA.
Me Gusto Muchisimo el DVD. Note una Edicin diferente a las demas. Las Escenas son mas compactas, precisas y no tan largas, quitando dialogos que aveces resultan reiterativos y todo lo del relleno.
En cuanto al Elenco tiene de todos bastante, de los protagonistas y tambien de los personajes secundarios. El Resumen es muy dinamico, fluido y te mantiene muy espectante, siempre pasa algo diferente y es muy adictivo, tiene amor, drama, humor, y sobretodo mucha accin, siempre te quedas con ganas de ver mas para saber que va a pasar.
Cuando me llego el DVD revise minusiosamente los 4 Discos, busque una a una las Escenas que recuerdo cuando la vi por Televisin y que queria volver a ver, y la verdad estan practicamente todas.
Dejando un poco de lado el fanatismo, sinceramente es un buen resumen, me atreveria a decir que uno de los mejores, (hasta el momento). La historia esta bien contada, con las partes mas importantes.
Hay escenas que como decia anteriormente que si bien no estan completas, son un poco mas cortas que las originales pero mantienen su escencia.
Como todo Resumen le faltan algunos detalles, algunas partes como por ejemplo: la pelea de Kendra con Nabila, algunas partes de Odette con Kendra, la escena en que Anibal Balvanera le regala una silla de ruedas, pero no son escenas tan importantes como para que queden partes inconclusas o confusas.
La Duracin del DVD, del Resumen Es 16 Hs y 1 Minuto, tiene la Musicalizacin Orginal, la Entrada y Salida como se transmiti en TV, en la Entrada el Tema de Alejandro Sanz No Me Compares y el de Mal Ahora Tu de Salida asi como en las Escenas de Amor de Victoria y Arriaga. Tambien se escucha el Tema de Eiza Gonzalez y Marconi Me Puedes Pedir Lo Que Sea en las Escenas de Nikki/Nicole y Guzman/Francci.
Cuando salga a la venta el DVD en octubre tambien comprare esta edicin/versin ya que me encanta coleccionar.
La verdad es una Exelente Telenovela, Comprenla, Les Va a Encantar, se los aseguro!!! La van a disfrutar muchisimo, asi como la disfrute yo.
Un Material nico, Imperdible y Para Coleccionar!!!",1374710400,10,2346,4.669082125603865

5835535,5,B00DNF1RSS,"Amores Verdaderos is One Of My Top-Three Favorite Telenovelas and is one of THE BEST Telenovelas. It would be a three-way tie between Amor Bravio, Amores Verdaderos, and Te Voy A Ensear A Querer (STILL Not Available On DVD!). Gorgeous Actors, Surprisingly Good Acting + Writing, and Outstanding Pop Soundtracks made this and the others pop and the secondary and tertiary characters are actually likable and respectable on their own power.  There is some condensation of some material which originally S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D Out Over Multiple Episodes but on the whole it's all here and all the parts you really care about are here.  Packaging is about as lazy, cheap, and unimaginative as they could get away with but discs arrived in mint condition with no problems.",1450137600,,762,5.088

5835555,5,B00DNF1RSS,"Delivered fast, excellent condition. I've seen many a show, but never, never one done so well. Locations are beautiful, perfect, the music is very well done. The older two actors and plot lines are done well and the chemistry is wonderful-but it is the younger couple that takes my breath away. HOT doesn't do it any kind of justice. Sebastian Rulli and Eiza Gonzalez were the perfect casting. You can't get a better ""princess"" of a girl or her strong, yet tender bodyguard. Again, I've seen every type of romance you can dream up-this is the perfect one. Never, NEVER, will I see something better than this. The stubborn girl that is snobby, like a princess, but insecure and when she meets her bodyguard, he is rock-hard like his stubborn jaw. He likes his rules and she likes to make him test them. And while they clash-she so wants him but is so insecure, but can't help herself even after everything. Same for him, she is his ward, his untouchable ward-one that he can't help but want to touch. So they do, because both can't help themselves-you can't stop it. Its the most delicious thing-they are stuck together, gladly, and ""can't be with one another"". But sure do have fun trying! Plot lines are juicy and when you truly delve into it you will see that they are truly faithful to one another. A blazing rarity in any category of media that contains romance. As with all shows they have to throw people in to keep them apart-that's just it-no one can. They are so meant to be, you can just swoon. Anyone and anything that comes between never truly separates them, they are always, always mindful of one another. I've never seen a show where the guy and/or girl is kissing someone else and doesn't like it. Like I said, when you get what the show is trying to portray, you will see a pair of stubborn, faithful, meant to be pair that literally can't do without one another. Everything about this couple was done to perfection. When they are in a room together, they are watchful of one another, when in different areas, they are always thinking of one another. Never have I seen a couple done so well. Both physically and emotionally. You wish they were together in real life! Imagine having the love of your life around you and wanting to touch them and having that tension, then having it released? Yup-you just melt!

For those who don't watch Spanish programming-I am not Spanish, but I taught myself a lot of it just watching telenovelas and looking up words from time to time. You will eventually get a huge understanding of the language and also slang that is used. Give it a try and then pick this up afterwards. The telenovelas that I love (not all of them) have more depth in their story-telling, music, and chemistry than most US shows you will ever see. I would pick certain ones over English programming any day. Sample the ones on Univision and its rerun channel UniMas, find something that seems interesting to you and give it a try. Why not? You'll also get to learn another language. Remember, when you buy DVD sets of them, however, most of the story is chopped out. Yes, I find it stupid too. Even watching it on the channel, they can chop scenes. For the most part only tiny bits are kept out. In the case of this one, this is my fav show ever so I just had to own the DVD and Music as well. I was lucky-When they aired this on Univision 2012-2013 they only chopped out literally about 10 seconds out of the whole show while it aired on TV here in the Tampa Bay area in Florida, United States. Again, when buying any telenovela on DVD, a lot of parts are always chopped out, be prepared. Some to the point they don't make much sense, but thankfully, this one does!",1408924800,,3691,4.476261127596439

5835560,5,B00DNF1RSS,"This novela was awesome in my opinion. The DVD set actually was able to get the most important scenes from the novela itself. It took out the annoying dragged out parts, which is great-but it also took out the filler funnier parts. It may be confusing and fast for those who have never seen the novela on TV, but it is a good rendering of the novela. I love it and I watched the novela from beginning to end.

5835561,4,B00DNF1RSS,"I bought this soap opera to see Sebastian Rulli. He plays a bodyguard hired by a rich family to protect their spoiled, anorexic daughter. They fall in love, but she is under pressure from her grandfather to marry a young, rich man or he will disinherit her.

Eduardo Yanez plays a farmer who needs a job badly to avoid losing his home. He happens to save the life of a very rich woman, and she hires him to be her bodyguard, then his wife and daughter move to this huge house, too. He loves his wife, but finds that he has feelings for his boss, too.

There are a lot of other characters whose stories weave into the main one - the grandfather has another daughter who had a child as a teenager, and he took the baby away. She is desperate to find out where her daughter is, but he won't tell. However, he has a former girlfriend who knows. Rulli's father is a gambler who has to be bailed out repeatedly to save him from a beating. Rulli's sister, played by Susana Gonzalez, has an abusive husband who won't leave her alone and takes their son.

The boss' husband is having an affair with a model, played by beautiful Marjorie de Souza, and she becomes pregnant and tells the wife all sorts of lies about the pregnancy and who the father is.",1399420800,,1242,4.299145299145299
5835562,5,B00DNF1RSS,"This soap opera is very well edited.  Would recommend to my ""novelas"" fan. I was hooked to the novela couldn't stop watching all the episodes at once.  Very good.",1393891200,,162,4.551724137931035
5835563,4,B00DNF1RSS,"Amores Verdaderos (True Loves - 951 minutes)

Burly ""hero"" is a cross between Steven Seagal and Fabio. Yuck! But his mature love story is a nice switch from some of the juvenile stuff we usually see. His amore verdad is the mother of an 18-year-old brat who wants to be a fashion model but is totally unwilling to develop any self control or self discipline. She is also bulimic, but her parents are oblivious; Mama because she is busy and Papa because he has a new girlfriend.

Of course we have many, many rounds of ""Who's Your Daddy?"" plus spoiled heiresses, stolen newborns, snoopy maids, tennis champions, ill-fated love affairs and studly bodyguards. As the story gains traction, we eventually see people find their inner goodness and do the right thing. The spoiled rich kids have a chance to learn their lessons and become decent human beings.

That evil grandfather is the villain I most want to see get his punishment. He is unrelenting, heartless and cruel, dismissive of all the pain he causes. No punishment can be vicious enough. Of course, like any good telenovela, this has more coincidences than a Charles Dickens novel...which is why we watch them. I'm happy to see Amazon has the DVD!",1392163200,,1203,4.774038461538462
