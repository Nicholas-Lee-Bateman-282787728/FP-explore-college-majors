3091077,5,B0012KK6QU,"As a daily practitioner of over 10 years I have a lot of yoga DVD's, but Zyrka's three releases are among my favorites.  I started with this one and enjoy using it, it is a serene stretching sequence for the days when I want to go deeply into the subleties of the practice, or when I have soreness or need to slow down and recalibrate.  Not sure why anyone would buy a Gentle Practice DVD and expect a power workout.

I personally prefer the six pre-designed sequences included here to those disjointed matrix DVD's.  The transitions flow smoothly and I don't have to remember how to put a balanced practice together.  The quality of the filming in this release is good, the sound is clear, the music is appropriate and subtle.  I am fine with a simple setting--primarily it's the quality of the teaching that matters to me.  Zyrka is first-rate, providing accurate queuing and refinements that are helpful, as well as very specific breathing instruction that will help a beginner to feel connected to what they are doing.  If you are looking for yoga instruction for slowly penetrating your openings and edges then you will enjoy this.  If you already like this one, I'd recommend Erich Schiffman's ""Beginning Yoga"" which you can find on his site.",1261526400,82,1248,4.714285714285714
3091078,5,B0012KK6QU,"I borrowed this DVD from my yoga instructor, and now it's definitely the most sought after item on my wish list.  I'm not fat or middle-aged or elderly, but I'm just horribly inflexible.  The basic/beginner yoga tapes fluster me and I end up giving up.  This one, however, is definitely my pace.  Zyrka is soothing and very instructive.  I find the individual tutorials on each pose to very helpful as well as the guided practices.

This is a great addition to my weekly yoga lessons.",1243209600,125,484,4.635294117647059
3091079,5,B0012KK6QU,"good for the middle aged out of shape folks
oh ya the fatter people too
you skinny people don't waste your $$$ you should rather go and eat something....lol",1239148800,6,156,4.413793103448276
3091080,5,B0012KK6QU,"I am 59 years and have never taken a yoga class. This video is very easy to understand and follow. It builds from the premise that you are just starting. The instructor is calm and concise in her instructions, making even the first tries very doable. I thoroughly enjoy my ""time"" with Zyrka. She is an excellent and charming instructor!!",1234224000,31,337,4.633333333333334
3091081,5,B0012KK6QU,"This DVD is not only a great introduction to the practice of yoga, but will provide the time and space for experienced practitioners to go deeper into the poses.  Zyrka has obviously been well trained and the whole practice comes from a very solid place.  She even includes inverted poses which are absent in many yoga DVDs.  This is also an excellent DVD for those who are interested in learning vinyasa yoga, but need a bridge to a more active practice.  If you want to deepen your yoga practice, this is the DVD for you.",1218844800,45,523,4.473684210526316
3091082,5,B0012KK6QU,"This DVD exceeded my expectations by far.  The production value is extremely high and professional - the filming, lighting, camera angles, etc, are superb.  Zyrka, the teacher leading the DVD, has a wonderful, soothing presence.  She is also very knowledgeable and I've learned a lot about yoga from her.  I'm going to order this DVD as a gift for my mother, who has never practiced yoga.  I highly recommend Yoga: Gentle Practice!",1205280000,60,431,4.930555555555555
3091083,5,B0012KK6QU,"I like the slow, gentle pace. I also like the emphasis on breathing. It is nice to have options on how long I want my yoga workout to be for that day.",1462924800,,150,3.71875

3091085,5,B0012KK6QU,"yes, this is a very good yoga dvd, like it very much.",1461283200,,53,3.5
3091086,5,B0012KK6QU,"Our local yoga studio closed, and we missed our yin yoga class. This is a good match to our class. It is a more relaxing and deep stretching yoga. Positions are held longer. I like that there are stages and different lengths of time on the dvd.",1457568000,3,244,4.212765957446808

3091091,5,B0012KK6QU,Excellent DVD. Well done.,1436572800,,25,5.5
3091092,5,B0012KK6QU,So glad I bought this DVD.  Very clear instruction and just what I was looking for.  My only criticism would be that Zyrka's voice should show a bit more inflection or personality.  On the other hand I can see that her intention is to be informative and consistent throughout.  Anyway it remains one of my favorite workouts and I still enjoy and use the programs frequently.  Very focused and relaxing.,1432771200,2,402,4.685714285714286
3091093,5,B0012KK6QU,Good DVD,1432252800,,8,3.5
3091094,5,B0012KK6QU,"It's so calming.

If only there were like 10 or 15 minute routines. Sometimes it is so quiet at the front desk and I can slip off to the break room for the longer session. But sometimes it's a bummer to be interrupted. And sometimes after a particularly trying test of my customer service I could use someone like Mz. Landwijt talking me into a happy place while stretching out the anger.

It really is gentle. And this is coming from someone with bad knees, neck and lower back. Plus I do it alone and don't get all competitive like in an actual class and then well you get the pic.",1429747200,,583,4.243243243243243
3091095,2,B0012KK6QU,It's a good video if you want to go super slow.,1425945600,4,47,3.3636363636363638

3091097,5,B0012KK6QU,"When I needed to recover from major surgery I used this video. It was great to get back on the mat in a gentle way, one step beyond restorative yoga. I like Zyrka's style of yoga. It is classical and soulful. I recommend this DVD for anyone new to yoga or has to take it slow for one reason or another. Namaste.",1422835200,3,311,4.032258064516129
3091098,5,B0012KK6QU,"Exactly as advertised; I highly recommend. I am 62 years old, in good health and in good shape. However, I have not done Yoga for over 30 years. This video has logical, easy to follow, well-paced routines that are just right for easing back into the practice. These are not extreme routines, nor are they to simple to be boring.",1422403200,,328,4.483333333333333
3091099,5,B0012KK6QU,Received this as a gift and I am so happy with it.  I am recovering from a shoulder and elbow injury and my flexibility is not what it used to be.  The first workout is great for getting you flexible and comfortable breathing without struggling in a position.  I am thrilled and think this will be the DVD that gets me into the yoga practice I have wanted for years.  It has 6 workouts that will allow me to progress as I am ready and to lengthen my practice as my body adjusts.  So happy I found this DVD.,1420329600,,506,4.070707070707071
3091100,5,B0012KK6QU,Wonderful relaxing but moving Yoga.  Lots of options for programs on this one DVD so I know everyone can find something they like on this program.,1415232000,,146,4.615384615384615
3091101,5,B0012KK6QU,"I've started the sessions.  It's divided into several levels and I have yet to look at a level after the first, or gentlest, level.  I also have to modify the gentle level for my knees so that they remain happy with me!",1413676800,,219,4.190476190476191
3091102,4,B0012KK6QU,Movements are fine but the demonstrator presumes that everyone has very flexible hips for sitting cross-legged. Techniques for stretching age-tightened muscles and ligaments would be helpful.,1411430400,,191,6.384615384615385
3091103,5,B0012KK6QU,Luv this practice-just what I needed,1410912000,,36,5.166666666666667
3091104,5,B0012KK6QU,Exactly as described which is unusual!,1407715200,,38,5.5
3091105,5,B0012KK6QU,"Perfect pace for over 60 crowd or if you are just beginning yoga.  A very relaxing, even paced practice.  I have practiced yoga for over 10 years and attended many classes - some hot, some very aerobic and some restorative.  I would consider this a restorative yoga practice.",1407369600,,275,4.6875
3091106,3,B0012KK6QU,This yoga video is just ok. Very slow moving and hardly feels like you have done anything afterwards. Not my favorite.,1406592000,,118,4.666666666666667
3091107,5,B0012KK6QU,"I've always been interested in Yoga but, like most people, have been afraid to go to a class and make a fool out of myself.  Bought this DVD based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did.  The session I've been using (33 minutes) is excellent and I can follow along without feeling rushed or like the moves are too hard to accomplish.  There is a section that focuses on each move and the instructor gives wonder tips on how to accomplish the move if you have limitations, as I do.  Recommend highly.",1403913600,,497,4.25531914893617
3091108,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is an excellent gentle practice, just as the title says!  There are multiple practices included so you can choose the time and level of difficulty.  This DVD is suitable for a wide range of people both new to yoga and experienced, with it's variety of practice choices.  If you are brand new to yoga, I still recommend you attend a beginner's class in addition so you have direct instruction and learning from a teacher as well.  Ms. Landwijt is an excellent instructor and leads a very effective beneficial gentle practice in this DVD.  Highly recommend for anyone seeking a gentler yoga practice!",1402272000,,603,4.815533980582524
3091109,5,B0012KK6QU,"I bought this for my mom and might buy it for one of my aunts. My mom loves it. That's basically what she told me and there is one motion in practical that you do that really stretches out various areas of your body at a time. You have a choice to of how long you want to do yoga as well. From what I remember they have a 30 mintue one and an hour long one. She made the mistake of doing the hour long one one day,but glad she did because that same day she cleaned a big house for someone and after she did the hour long workout she said it helped her to be more flexible. This dvd sounds like a good one to get.",1401667200,2,612,3.751937984496124
3091110,5,B0012KK6QU,Bought it for my collection of yoga DVD but it probably won't be a favorite.  Something about the music and her voice that isn't pleasing.,1401235200,,138,4.52
3091111,4,B0012KK6QU,"I was surprised at how seemingly simple stretches really made a difference. Good instruction, easy-to-follow. In my 50s, so just right in helping me become more limber.",1399852800,,168,5.2592592592592595
3091112,5,B0012KK6QU,"For a serene, challenging yoga session, buy this DVD.  Just plain effective, thoughtful and supportive.  Practice your yoga mindfully with Zyrka, like I do.",1395187200,,156,5.458333333333333
3091113,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is a wonderful, gentle and restorative yoga DVD. It helped me to regain mobility and desire to begin again and now ready for more challenge which I began using her Gentle Vinyasa Flow DVD. Perfect compliment to each other. I will return to practice this often, as it is great for an early morning or late evening relaxation practice.",1391817600,2,338,4.65
3091114,5,B0012KK6QU,"I'm 64 and like other women my age I suffer from stiff joints and tight muscles and have found yoga to be an excellent way to counter these body changes.  Also like many others I find yoga classes to be a bit intimidating.  This dvd is perfect for my needs.  There are 6 different lessons of various lengths.  The poses range from fairly easy (for me) to somewhat challenging.  I have many yoga dvds and this is one I keep coming back to.  The instructions are clear so I don't have to constantly watch the screen.  like alternating this dvd with the static poses with the equally excellent Gentle Flow Yoga.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a practice that is not trying to be a cardio workout, but also is not for those with physical limitations.  No chair workouts here.",1390953600,4,780,4.475177304964539
3091115,5,B0012KK6QU,"As someone who has had to reduce the intensity of my yoga workouts due to injuries, I enjoy this workout a great deal. There are six classes of different lengths, so depending on how much time you have, you can always find time to practice.
Zyrka gives nice hints and detail for each posture, without overwhelming you with too much chatter. This allows for a quieting, yet challenging experience.
Good for building, maintaining flexibility and quieting the mind. It is definitely not power yoga, but you see changes in your flexiblity and confidence each time you practice.",1389225600,3,573,4.917525773195877
3091116,5,B0012KK6QU,I just turned 60 and this is the first time I've tried yoga. I love this dvd and instructor. Feeling great after a few lessons.,1389225600,,127,4.12
3091117,5,B0012KK6QU,"An awesome gentle yoga.  I have back pain and it is a great, easy, gentle way to help work stiffnes out.",1388102400,,104,3.9523809523809526
3091118,4,B0012KK6QU,I gave it a 4 star because it is a little slow but it is for beginners.  I liked it to limber up and the time length is very nice.  Tks,1387929600,,135,3.3225806451612905
3091119,5,B0012KK6QU,"Good product but found it to be designed for someone with a bit less experience/flexibility .  Didn't feel the calm I normally feel from a more deeply stretching  yoga video,  kept it just in case I get an injury and need the lightest workout possible.",1384387200,,252,4.555555555555555
3091120,5,B0012KK6QU,I'm not big into yoga but this DVD gives me to chance to work on my flexibility at home and progress at my own pace.,1383004800,,116,3.68
3091121,5,B0012KK6QU,"If you want more active motion, this DVD perhaps is not a cup of your tea. But to me, this is a very very good DVD. I enjoy every posture she tutors. Actually, on my understanding of Yoga, every posture should be a relaxing posture. No matter how hard the posture is, you have to find the way of relaxation on that posture.",1381104000,,323,4.142857142857143
3091122,1,B0012KK6QU,Not happy with my order it skips and freezes.  Haven't viewed the others.  Disappointed with Amazon return policy. Because we have not really had the time to try the rest out waiting for the cooler weather which is now and to late to return is not working right.  Why would they sell DVD that they know skips and freeze??,1379116800,3,321,4.406779661016949
3091123,5,B0012KK6QU,"I find these routines easy to follow and pleasant to do. Challenging, but not overly so. A great introduction to yoga. Also, both the music and the instructor's voice are very soothing.",1377820800,,185,4.8125
3091124,5,B0012KK6QU,I've tested a number of yoga and other exercise dvd's. This one is just about my favorite of all time. I prefer to do my yoga in the morning. These exercises suit my temperament so well. I get to wake up slowly and low to the ground. I have only done the half hour A and B series routines. The longer ones I haven't tested yet. Both routines are great for loosening the limbs in a very gentle way. The A series has quite a bit of blanket management but you soon get used to it. I really like her voice and clear instructions and that there is time to be in each pose.,1377734400,2,567,3.982456140350877
3091125,5,B0012KK6QU,This DVD offers 6 different routines to choose from as your time and ability permits.  It has been the only DVD in my vast collection truly easy enough to start with after being sedentary for over a year with illness including multiple types of arthritis.  This DVD has been so important in my recovery as getting started without over doing it is the hardest part when beginning a new fitness program... Especially if you have arthritis.,1372550400,6,437,4.7368421052631575
3091126,4,B0012KK6QU,"ThisI bought this DVD with Yoga Stress Relief and Yoga Therapy Prescriptions, when I was looking for something specifically to help my lower back and to increase my flexibility. This one by far was may favorite out of them. The instructor rocks, she walks you through each move and it felt great on my back.",1371513600,7,307,4.6
3091127,5,B0012KK6QU,"I have been taking yoga for a couple of years. This DVD is one that can be adapted to one's own routine and level
or as it is presented.
The teacher's cues are superb, the movements are slow, graceful,and focused.
The poses are presented with their ""yoga"" names without any fanfare or attempted  ""mysticism,"" which can be off-putting.

Love this and have given one to a friend who anticipates a double knee replacement.
Fabulous for opening chakra points.",1371427200,4,455,4.82051282051282
3091128,5,B0012KK6QU,"I practice at home in our living room with neighbors who have a host of age 50-70 concerns from old rotator cuff injuries to two types of arthritis. I'm in relatively good health, but I took the time to watch the detailed instructions of poses before trying the first 1/2 hour practice. As someone who thought props were not needed, I loved learning a blanket can help me achieve a deeper, more stable pose. The musical background is soothing, and the instructor's voice and instruction is clear. I find it interesting that she dubs her voice over the practice, which I think allows for better instruction. Also, for people afraid of hurting themselves, the pose instruction includes clear contraindications. Because it offers six practices that build on one another, I look forward to working through this practice regularly.",1369094400,8,826,4.992753623188406
3091129,5,B0012KK6QU,This dvd is perfect for people who want to do a gentle yoga practice on some days. Deceivingly simple but effective & Zyrka's voice is soothing & encouraging.,1367452800,,158,4.678571428571429
3091130,2,B0012KK6QU,"I liked the product, but it is very slow moving. I wanted more Asthanga type yoga. This is like yoga for babies and it did not really suit my needs. I want Yoga that was more of a workout and not like physical therapy.",1363478400,2,218,3.977272727272727
3091131,4,B0012KK6QU,"There is a wealth of information on this disc.  I love that it is organized so that you can choose among 6 sequences of varying lengths.  There is, in addition, a pose guide which takes you through all the poses in great detail and much more slowly than in the sequences so that you can check your form and look for alternatives when you are having trouble.  I consider breathing to be the most important thing about yoga, and there is a special bit on that as well.  The music is non-intrusive.  My only complaint, and this may be only me, is that she doesn't hold the poses as long as I would like.  And she's a little fussy about getting out of even the most simple pose, so that it seems you are doing a lot of needless arm fluttering.  In all, I like this video very much, and I especially like it paired with the Tamal Dodge Yoga for Beginners.
Update:  After a few months I have come to value this tape very much.  Now that I understand what she's doing, I understand that she is being very careful that you come in and out of a pose correctly and not hurt yourself, and while she may err on the careful side, that's okay.  I have serious back problems.  Also, a recent book by an M.D. recommends that you hold a pose for a long time to ease your back problems, and to begin very slowly at 10% of what you think you can do. I sometimes use the ""extra"" time to just stay in the pose.  MOST IMPORTANTLY--you will not get this much valuable information on any other tape.",1362700800,18,1475,4.191489361702128

3091133,2,B0012KK6QU,"I figured a ""gentle practice"" DVD would be a good way to get my 65 year old muscles into yoga.  Unfortunately, her basic postures - which are all nicely and slowly done - start from the sitting cross-legged position.  Since I can't get into that position, the DVD is useless.  I may go back to using it after I find some other way to get more limber.  If you are young and flexible, this DVD should be fine.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it.",1359676800,16,441,4.265060240963855

3091137,5,B0012KK6QU,"I have been doing yoga for years and this is my favorite yoga video. I do yoga more to keep my sanity and this video is great for me because it is so relaxing but also gives you a good stretch. She has a really calming voice and gives clear instructions so you don't have to keep watching the screen to know what you are doing. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an experienced yogi, I think everybody can take something from these workouts.",1357689600,,449,4.172413793103448

Perfect for gently improving flexibility and strength.

3091139,5,B0012KK6QU,I loved this dvd so much I just bought it as a gift for someone else.  Zyrka explains each move thoroughly and moves slowly enough for a new practicer to follow without falling behind.  Probably the best dvd out of all the different exercise dvds I've ever purchased.,1357516800,,267,4.541666666666667
3091140,4,B0012KK6QU,"After initially being irritated by the instructor and her boring monotonic voice, I eventually have gotten used to this DVD. Now her voice actually helps me keep relaxed. What I like most about this DVD is choice of different length and intensity practices that allow flexibility in my schedule. Also, I really like how the movements flow from one to another and really keep aligned with the flow of the breath. As the title suggests, don't buy this DVD if you are looking for an intense workout; rather you will get a relaxing workout that stretches you at the same time.",1355616000,4,572,4.673267326732673
3091141,5,B0012KK6QU,"I have enjoyed this practice very much.  It is gentle and meditative.  There are different practices to choose, of varying lengths.  It met my needs for a gentle practice, and I have liked the 33 minute program when I don't have a lot of time.  If you are looking for a strenuous ""workout"", this is not it.

It's broken down into 1/2 hr, 45 mins and 1 hr increments.  It's also broken down into an easy workout and a more challenging workout.

There are 6 different routines and levels to go through so it was easy for me to get started with this VERY relaxing program.

The first 10 minutes of the 30 minute routine are spent crossed-legged (and other alternative positions on the floor do not allow you to perform the arm and neck stretches she does while crossed-legged); I reviewed all of the routines on the DVD and they all start out this way.  If you cannot sit crossed-legged then you cannot get through the beginning of the routine and I would not recommend this DVD.

3091166,5,B0012KK6QU,"At 34 years old, 19 months after having my daughter, and 9 months of the most body wrenching hyperemesis during my pregnancy with her (severe morning sickness), my body was tight, inflexible, and hard to relax.

I had done yoga for years before, but I had also lapsed for several years because of my situation.  After reading the positive reviews, I knew this DVD would help me to get my flexibility back; which is so important before being able to throw myself back into a regular Yoga and exercise (P90) routine.

The format is good - Zykra does the poses carefully, slowly in the beginning.  Her voice is dubbed over, which I really enjoyed because this allows her to flow without being distracted or break in her guidance to maneuver.  Her voice is calm, soothing, and made it easy to sink into the positions without being distracted by her instructions and guidance.  This in turn made my efforts flow right along with her.

The effect: I am successfully becoming more and more flexible.  When beginning, it had been a while since I had done any yoga as I said before and I was pleasantly reminded how Yoga deeply affects my body.  It is a physically awakening experience, allowing the mind to ""check into"" each section of the body, creating an awareness that I don't have in the rush of my day to day activities.  It lasts throughout the day and I've notice chores and every day activities are easier to accomplish.

I HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone beginning Yoga as it is a great introduction to Yoga.  It delivers on it's promises.",1329350400,4,1547,4.626373626373627

The instructor has a wonderful soothing voice as she gently guides you through the sequences.  By the way, the value for money is outstanding.  You get six programs of varying levels.  Two are 30 minutes long.  Two are 45 minutes or so.  And two are an hour.  In addition, there is an hour long pose guide that will instruct you on practicing the individual poses.

3091170,5,B0012KK6QU,"I really recommend this to people who suffer from back, joint or muscle problems. It may even be ideal for those who are looking for a relaxing stretch. I wanted something that I could stretch and relax to, even if I wasn't in the mood to do much else. I tried other stretching programs, such as the AM/PM Stretch, which is also good, but I was surprised to see that this yoga routine hit the spot more. Normally, I don't even care for yoga and most of the routines that I've tried/purchased were anything but relaxing.

I can easily say that this is my favorite ""workout"" and one that I look forward to doing, which says something, considering how lazy I get. Even after doing previous stretching and workout DVDs (including the AM/PM stretch), I could barely raise my arms or touch my toes at one point because my body was so out of whack, but this had me loosened up within a week or less. My TMJ has also lessened a bit, which was a handy bonus. Even so, the more often I do it, the better I feel. I also notice a difference if I slack off for a week or so, or just lack the time to do anything, but once I give this another go, I start feeling good again after a day or two.

Since I workout in other ways, I mainly do the initial 33-minute portion of Series A 3 to 4 days a week when I have time, since it's my favorite and gets the job done. I find it highly effective and extremely relaxing at the same time. In fact, I frequently do it at night to wind down, almost using it as a little treat for myself. I even feel that just the 33-minute workout is well worth the price alone. I also try to do one or two days a week of the other portions of the DVD, just for a little bit of a challenge and to build strength.

I really enjoy the instructor, who seems down to earth and mellow. Her voice is soothing and she does a great job of explaining things throughout the workout. The music is also lovely and simple in nature. Some people don't care for the white background, but I actually appreciate it. I love a pretty background in other workouts, but I also feel that having one can distract me. The white background in this series, however, lets me focus on my breathing and movements instead.

All in all, I think this would be good for people who aren't very limber or those who suffer from back/joint/muscle problems. It would also be suitable for those who want a good stretching workout or for first-time individuals. I like it well enough that I'm even considering purchasing her more difficult DVDs later on, once I get back into shape.",1323561600,12,2552,4.2556701030927835

But then I decided to try the two most difficult routines for a few days, and was pleasantly surprised. It turns out that the reason I've never been able to get a daily yoga routine going is because I wasn't accurately matching my fitness level for what I could do without breaks of more than 24 hours between sessions.

Though only 2 out of the 6 routines on the disc are useful to me, those 2 are sooooo useful that it's worth the price of the disc just to get them.

3091179,5,B0012KK6QU,"I am a yoga teacher who's been extensively researching yoga DVD's and student reviews before I create my own. If you're looking for a yoga DVD that suits you, here's what I discovered:
1) Do your own research to find both the teacher and yoga style that best suits
  your personal preferences. Pace, voice quality, clarity, etc. It's like
  finding the doctor, dentist, massage therapist, etc. that you like and trust.
2) If you are a Beginner, find a reputable teacher and take a live class first,
  if possible. Then research a DVD. Many of the negative yoga DVD reviews I
  read came from Beginners who, precisely because they are new to yoga, found
  the DVD they bought too challenging, even ones labeled Beginner or Gentle
  Yoga. It takes great awareness from a teacher, particularly if they are in
  shape, flexible and strong to really remember what it's like to be a
  Beginner. Teachers often forget to show modifications and use of props.
3) Watch a yoga DVD first, maybe even a few times, before following along.
So, as far as Zyrka's ""Gentle Practice"" DVD goes, I found her style to be thorough in explanation, calming, smooth, mindful-based. She offers modifications, the use of props and is very mindful of and speaks to the refinement of body movement.
She teaches what I call classical yoga, not gymnastic yoga (pretzel poses). If you're a hot yoga fan, this DVD probably won't do it for you! I think this DVD is appropriate for Beginners.
I like that she has a section that is devoted to individually teaching several different yoga postures and then does a few different time length flows with them. Again, if you're a Beginner, her referencing the posture name might throw you off a bit but, she does do a good job of verbal cuing. I like that she cues movements a second or two before she actually does the movement which gives the viewer the ability to stay in sync with her. I also like that she incorporates in many warm-ups and basic movements along with recognized yoga postures. There's a lot of material here for your money, too.",1314144000,303,2058,4.659279778393352

The instructor's voice is soothing and calm, and the music is just enough to add to the ""mood"" without being distracting. The descriptions and transitions during the practice are very clear, so that after the first time through the routine I never have to look at the screen again. That sounds like such a minor thing, but it allows you to truly focus on your posture, breath, and state of mind, instead of having to look at the TV every 30 seconds to understand what she's talking about.

It helps me start out my day relaxed, calm, and connected to myself.  I highly recommend for anyone who suffers from depression and anxiety.  The poses are gengtle enough that anyone can do them, hence why it is called gentle practice.  I think it's an amazing DVD.",1302393600,24,386,4.305555555555555

I love this dvd. Zyrka is an absolute pleasure to listen to . She has a quiet gentle voice . I don't think she adds any superfluous comments that can get irritating after doing the dvd several times. I am 55 yrs old and recommend this dvd wholeheartedly to people who are stiff and want to increase their health without injury. I focus now on her instructions and this has brought my experience up to a whole new level of enjoyment.

3091186,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is my first review that I've ever written, so this goes to show how much I like the DVD.  Personally, I liked how there is a pose guide where she will tell you the benefits and some of the contradictions for each pose.  After that she will then show you how to modify each pose to meet your individual needs.  Another thing that is great is her voice it's nice to listen to and after you get used to working with the DVD you won't have to keep your eyes open to follow along. Overall, this is my first yoga DVD that I had the privilege of working with and I am pleased to have gotten this one over any other yoga DVD.",1294272000,29,622,4.0
3091187,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is the 3rd Yoga DVD I've bought and I must say this one is the easiest and definitely a must have!  For starters, her voice is paced well and easy to understand and follow without looking at the screen to see what to do next, making many other DVDs a neck bender to have to see for the example.  The videography is a delight- well lit, and does not bounce all over the place like many others which would make it difficult to concentrate.  Well done!",1292716800,8,454,4.195402298850575
3091188,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is a beautiful practice DVD. Zyrka leads us through the practice with mindfulness and attention to alignment and breath. Her instruction is clear and uncomplicated.

The real power of yoga is in becoming aware of your body without judgement. Zyrka's calming voice helps us to release tension, which allows us to free the body's energy for strength in the poses. Zyrka flows into and out of each pose, demonstrating one of the key principles of yoga as described in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras: the practice of asana with grace and ease.

I have practiced yoga for over 20 years, and have taught yoga since 2003. My studio focuses on mindfully, gently taught Hatha Yoga, and I'm often asked for recommendations of DVDs to practice with at home. This one will definitely be on my list! I'll be using this DVD in my own home practice on a regular basis!

Great for beginners, those recovering from injury, or for people who want to have a more meditative approach to practice.",1291334400,55,974,4.7514792899408285

3091191,5,B0012KK6QU,"I got this program precisely for its gentle, relaxing qualities.  I like to do a short yoga program before retiring to relax my body and unwind my mind. This program is perfect! I did it this morning just in case it would be too 'active' for sleep.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that savasana was a modified form of yoga nidra.  When Zyrka stated that the program was finished, I did not want to get up.  I was too relaxed...mentally and physically! If you are looking for something invigorgating, this is not the best program.  But then, Zyrka has others that fit that need.  If you want to 'lazily' stretch and flex and then feel totally relaxed, this is your program.  It starts off active and ends very passive.  It had the same impact on me as my first flight in a glider plane! (I had felt as though I were being rocked in cradle!)",1267315200,13,852,4.382165605095541

It's excellent for anyone who wants to get the stretching benefits of yoga without worrying about hurting themselves.  The instructions are clear, concise and easy to understand and the instructor is pleasant and not overbearing, which is a plus. I'm enjoying it very much!",1264896000,18,435,4.7105263157894735
3325574,5,B0012KK6QU,"As a daily practitioner of over 10 years I have a lot of yoga DVD's, but Zyrka's three releases are among my favorites.  I started with this one and enjoy using it, it is a serene stretching sequence for the days when I want to go deeply into the subleties of the practice, or when I have soreness or need to slow down and recalibrate.  Not sure why anyone would buy a Gentle Practice DVD and expect a power workout.

I personally prefer the six pre-designed sequences included here to those disjointed matrix DVD's.  The transitions flow smoothly and I don't have to remember how to put a balanced practice together.  The quality of the filming in this release is good, the sound is clear, the music is appropriate and subtle.  I am fine with a simple setting--primarily it's the quality of the teaching that matters to me.  Zyrka is first-rate, providing accurate queuing and refinements that are helpful, as well as very specific breathing instruction that will help a beginner to feel connected to what they are doing.  If you are looking for yoga instruction for slowly penetrating your openings and edges then you will enjoy this.  If you already like this one, I'd recommend Erich Schiffman's ""Beginning Yoga"" which you can find on his site.",1261526400,82,1248,4.714285714285714

I'm not fat or middle-aged or elderly, but I'm just horribly inflexible.  The basic/beginner yoga tapes fluster me and I end up giving up.  This one, however, is definitely my pace.  Zyrka is soothing and very instructive.  I find the individual tutorials on each pose to very helpful as well as the guided practices.

This is a great addition to my weekly yoga lessons.",1243209600,125,484,4.635294117647059

Zyrka has obviously been well trained and the whole practice comes from a very solid place.  She even includes inverted poses which are absent in many yoga DVDs.  This is also an excellent DVD for those who are interested in learning vinyasa yoga, but need a bridge to a more active practice.

3325589,5,B0012KK6QU,So glad I bought this DVD.  Very clear instruction and just what I was looking for.  My only criticism would be that Zyrka's voice should show a bit more inflection or personality.  On the other hand I can see that her intention is to be informative and consistent throughout.  Anyway it remains one of my favorite workouts and I still enjoy and use the programs frequently.  Very focused and relaxing.,1432771200,2,402,4.685714285714286

If only there were like 10 or 15 minute routines. Sometimes it is so quiet at the front desk and I can slip off to the break room for the longer session. But sometimes it's a bummer to be interrupted. And sometimes after a particularly trying test of my customer service I could use someone like Mz.

Zyrka gives nice hints and detail for each posture, without overwhelming you with too much chatter. This allows for a quieting, yet challenging experience.

As someone who thought props were not needed, I loved learning a blanket can help me achieve a deeper, more stable pose. The musical background is soothing, and the instructor's voice and instruction is clear. I find it interesting that she dubs her voice over the practice, which I think allows for better instruction. Also, for people afraid of hurting themselves, the pose instruction includes clear contraindications.

3325628,4,B0012KK6QU,"There is a wealth of information on this disc.  I love that it is organized so that you can choose among 6 sequences of varying lengths.  There is, in addition, a pose guide which takes you through all the poses in great detail and much more slowly than in the sequences so that you can check your form and look for alternatives when you are having trouble.  I consider breathing to be the most important thing about yoga, and there is a special bit on that as well.  The music is non-intrusive.  My only complaint, and this may be only me, is that she doesn't hold the poses as long as I would like.  And she's a little fussy about getting out of even the most simple pose, so that it seems you are doing a lot of needless arm fluttering.  In all, I like this video very much, and I especially like it paired with the Tamal Dodge Yoga for Beginners.
Update:  After a few months I have come to value this tape very much.  Now that I understand what she's doing, I understand that she is being very careful that you come in and out of a pose correctly and not hurt yourself, and while she may err on the careful side, that's okay.  I have serious back problems.  Also, a recent book by an M.D. recommends that you hold a pose for a long time to ease your back problems, and to begin very slowly at 10% of what you think you can do. I sometimes use the ""extra"" time to just stay in the pose.  MOST IMPORTANTLY--you will not get this much valuable information on any other tape.",1362700800,18,1475,4.191489361702128

Unfortunately, her basic postures - which are all nicely and slowly done - start from the sitting cross-legged position.  Since I can't get into that position, the DVD is useless.

I believe this DVD would be great for me if I could sit crossed-legged on the floor - unfortunately I cannot even using props. The first 10 minutes of the 30 minute routine are spent crossed-legged (and other alternative positions on the floor do not allow you to perform the arm and neck stretches she does while crossed-legged); I reviewed all of the routines on the DVD and they all start out this way.  If you cannot sit crossed-legged then you cannot get through the beginning of the routine and I would not recommend this DVD. After the first 10 minutes the routines seem good but probably not for me.,1339804800,34,732,4.496240601503759

3325663,5,B0012KK6QU,"At 34 years old, 19 months after having my daughter, and 9 months of the most body wrenching hyperemesis during my pregnancy with her (severe morning sickness), my body was tight, inflexible, and hard to relax.

I had done yoga for years before, but I had also lapsed for several years because of my situation.  After reading the positive reviews, I knew this DVD would help me to get my flexibility back; which is so important before being able to throw myself back into a regular Yoga and exercise (P90) routine.

The format is good - Zykra does the poses carefully, slowly in the beginning.  Her voice is dubbed over, which I really enjoyed because this allows her to flow without being distracted or break in her guidance to maneuver.  Her voice is calm, soothing, and made it easy to sink into the positions without being distracted by her instructions and guidance.  This in turn made my efforts flow right along with her.

The effect: I am successfully becoming more and more flexible.  When beginning, it had been a while since I had done any yoga as I said before and I was pleasantly reminded how Yoga deeply affects my body.  It is a physically awakening experience, allowing the mind to ""check into"" each section of the body, creating an awareness that I don't have in the rush of my day to day activities.  It lasts throughout the day and I've notice chores and every day activities are easier to accomplish.

I HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone beginning Yoga as it is a great introduction to Yoga.  It delivers on it's promises.",1329350400,4,1547,4.626373626373627

The instructor has a wonderful soothing voice as she gently guides you through the sequences.  By the way, the value for money is outstanding.  You get six programs of varying levels.  Two are 30 minutes long.  Two are 45 minutes or so.  And two are an hour.  In addition, there is an hour long pose guide that will instruct you on practicing the individual poses.

3325667,5,B0012KK6QU,"I really recommend this to people who suffer from back, joint or muscle problems. It may even be ideal for those who are looking for a relaxing stretch. I wanted something that I could stretch and relax to, even if I wasn't in the mood to do much else. I tried other stretching programs, such as the AM/PM Stretch, which is also good, but I was surprised to see that this yoga routine hit the spot more. Normally, I don't even care for yoga and most of the routines that I've tried/purchased were anything but relaxing.

I can easily say that this is my favorite ""workout"" and one that I look forward to doing, which says something, considering how lazy I get. Even after doing previous stretching and workout DVDs (including the AM/PM stretch), I could barely raise my arms or touch my toes at one point because my body was so out of whack, but this had me loosened up within a week or less. My TMJ has also lessened a bit, which was a handy bonus. Even so, the more often I do it, the better I feel. I also notice a difference if I slack off for a week or so, or just lack the time to do anything, but once I give this another go, I start feeling good again after a day or two.

Since I workout in other ways, I mainly do the initial 33-minute portion of Series A 3 to 4 days a week when I have time, since it's my favorite and gets the job done. I find it highly effective and extremely relaxing at the same time. In fact, I frequently do it at night to wind down, almost using it as a little treat for myself. I even feel that just the 33-minute workout is well worth the price alone. I also try to do one or two days a week of the other portions of the DVD, just for a little bit of a challenge and to build strength.

I really enjoy the instructor, who seems down to earth and mellow. Her voice is soothing and she does a great job of explaining things throughout the workout. The music is also lovely and simple in nature. Some people don't care for the white background, but I actually appreciate it. I love a pretty background in other workouts, but I also feel that having one can distract me. The white background in this series, however, lets me focus on my breathing and movements instead.

All in all, I think this would be good for people who aren't very limber or those who suffer from back/joint/muscle problems. It would also be suitable for those who want a good stretching workout or for first-time individuals. I like it well enough that I'm even considering purchasing her more difficult DVDs later on, once I get back into shape.",1323561600,12,2552,4.2556701030927835

The flow and instruciton are excellent, her voice is soothing, the pace is wonderful. I would definetly purchase more DVD's with her as the instructor.",1316649600,2,250,4.704545454545454
3325674,5,B0012KK6QU,"I'm glad I waited a week to write this review. The first time I went through this DVD I was utterly unimpressed. Most of the DVD is just way too easy for me, as to be boring. But then I decided to try the two most difficult routines for a few days, and was pleasantly surprised. It turns out that the reason I've never been able to get a daily yoga routine going is because I wasn't accurately matching my fitness level for what I could do without breaks of more than 24 hours between sessions.

Though only 2 out of the 6 routines on the disc are useful to me, those 2 are sooooo useful that it's worth the price of the disc just to get them. And once I outgrow this disc, I will definitely get the next one up from this yoga teacher,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Flow/dp/B0029KMDXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Flow</a>. She is a great teacher. She cues what she does really well, so that you can follow along without watching the screen once you get the hang of proper alignment by watching her the first few times through. Her voice is soothing, and her explanations are quite clear. For the price of a single yoga class, you get routines you can do every day for weeks or even months. Definitely a good buy.",1315267200,18,1266,4.677130044843049
3325675,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is the best Yoga DVD ever, for beginners!  Very easy to follow and expertly done!  Instructor is fantastic.  Worth every penny. Highly recommend.",1314230400,5,150,5.166666666666667
3325676,5,B0012KK6QU,"I am a yoga teacher who's been extensively researching yoga DVD's and student reviews before I create my own. If you're looking for a yoga DVD that suits you, here's what I discovered:
1) Do your own research to find both the teacher and yoga style that best suits
  your personal preferences. Pace, voice quality, clarity, etc. It's like
  finding the doctor, dentist, massage therapist, etc. that you like and trust.
2) If you are a Beginner, find a reputable teacher and take a live class first,
  if possible. Then research a DVD. Many of the negative yoga DVD reviews I
  read came from Beginners who, precisely because they are new to yoga, found
  the DVD they bought too challenging, even ones labeled Beginner or Gentle
  Yoga. It takes great awareness from a teacher, particularly if they are in
  shape, flexible and strong to really remember what it's like to be a
  Beginner. Teachers often forget to show modifications and use of props.
3) Watch a yoga DVD first, maybe even a few times, before following along.
So, as far as Zyrka's ""Gentle Practice"" DVD goes, I found her style to be thorough in explanation, calming, smooth, mindful-based. She offers modifications, the use of props and is very mindful of and speaks to the refinement of body movement.
She teaches what I call classical yoga, not gymnastic yoga (pretzel poses). If you're a hot yoga fan, this DVD probably won't do it for you! I think this DVD is appropriate for Beginners.
I like that she has a section that is devoted to individually teaching several different yoga postures and then does a few different time length flows with them. Again, if you're a Beginner, her referencing the posture name might throw you off a bit but, she does do a good job of verbal cuing. I like that she cues movements a second or two before she actually does the movement which gives the viewer the ability to stay in sync with her. I also like that she incorporates in many warm-ups and basic movements along with recognized yoga postures. There's a lot of material here for your money, too.",1314144000,303,2058,4.659279778393352
3325677,5,B0012KK6QU,"I enjoy this program very much.  Since I have never used an excerise video before, I didn't know what to expect.  This one turned out to be a very good choice.  Its easy and fun while still being valuable for its thorough workouts. Zyrka goes slowly and picks simple but deeply satisfying poses.  There is music in the background, which is neither too loud or irratating.  Most of all, I like being able to adjust how much time I spent with the lessons, an advantage with all DVD's.  I highly recommend this product.",1310342400,8,516,4.494623655913978
3325678,5,B0012KK6QU,I love this yoga DVD. It is very gentle although it's a workout. The instructor's voice is very soothing. I sometimes fall asleep at the end during the relaxation. I would buy again from this vendor.,1308873600,,199,4.555555555555555
3325679,5,B0012KK6QU,"I've been on the hunt for a good gentle yoga DVD and I've definitely found it with this!! With 6 different routines to choose from, I can pick what fits best into my day and my body's capabilities at the current time. The pose guide is great to have for beginners and anyone that would like a refresher; the descriptions are excellent, especially when she includes the benefits of the pose. The instructor's voice is soothing and calm, and the music is just enough to add to the ""mood"" without being distracting. The descriptions and transitions during the practice are very clear, so that after the first time through the routine I never have to look at the screen again. That sounds like such a minor thing, but it allows you to truly focus on your posture, breath, and state of mind, instead of having to look at the TV every 30 seconds to understand what she's talking about.
I highly highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a gentle yoga DVD.",1307577600,16,955,4.526011560693641
3325680,5,B0012KK6QU,"I Love this DVD. Its easy and it stretches you really well.  It has 6 workouts, from 33 Minutes Up to 68 Minute practice. Also has Level 1 and level 2. It is easy to follow , one of the best Instructions, and music combo's Ive seen.  If your looking for a rigorous Yoga practice, this is NOT it. It is ""Gentle"".  You stil feel very stretched and good, but at a Slower pace. I think this would be great after a Weight work out or a Run.  I enjoy doing this DVD and have done it every other day Since I got it.  I was even sore after the 1st time I used it. Granted I Haven't Stretched really good in quite a While.  So You really do feel it.. Great for people who need to loosen up and new to Yoga or even ones who do Yoga everyday.",1306627200,7,731,3.84
3325681,5,B0012KK6QU,"I love this DVD more than any other yoga DVD that I own.  I usually use it every morning and do the 30 minute routines.  It helps me start out my day relaxed, calm, and connected to myself.  I highly recommend for anyone who suffers from depression and anxiety.  The poses are gengtle enough that anyone can do them, hence why it is called gentle practice.  I think it's an amazing DVD.",1302393600,24,386,4.305555555555555

I love this dvd. Zyrka is an absolute pleasure to listen to . She has a quiet gentle voice . I don't think she adds any superfluous comments that can get irritating after doing the dvd several times. I am 55 yrs old and recommend this dvd wholeheartedly to people who are stiff and want to increase their health without injury. I focus now on her instructions and this has brought my experience up to a whole new level of enjoyment. I notice that her flow series dvd&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Gentle-Vinyasa-Flow/dp/B0012KK6QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow</a>&nbsp;is filmed outside under trees.

3325683,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is my first review that I've ever written, so this goes to show how much I like the DVD.  Personally, I liked how there is a pose guide where she will tell you the benefits and some of the contradictions for each pose.  After that she will then show you how to modify each pose to meet your individual needs.  Another thing that is great is her voice it's nice to listen to and after you get used to working with the DVD you won't have to keep your eyes open to follow along. Overall, this is my first yoga DVD that I had the privilege of working with and I am pleased to have gotten this one over any other yoga DVD.",1294272000,29,622,4.0
3325684,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is the 3rd Yoga DVD I've bought and I must say this one is the easiest and definitely a must have!  For starters, her voice is paced well and easy to understand and follow without looking at the screen to see what to do next, making many other DVDs a neck bender to have to see for the example.  The videography is a delight- well lit, and does not bounce all over the place like many others which would make it difficult to concentrate.  Well done!",1292716800,8,454,4.195402298850575
3325685,5,B0012KK6QU,"This is a beautiful practice DVD. Zyrka leads us through the practice with mindfulness and attention to alignment and breath. Her instruction is clear and uncomplicated.

The real power of yoga is in becoming aware of your body without judgement. Zyrka's calming voice helps us to release tension, which allows us to free the body's energy for strength in the poses. Zyrka flows into and out of each pose, demonstrating one of the key principles of yoga as described in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras: the practice of asana with grace and ease.

I have practiced yoga for over 20 years, and have taught yoga since 2003. My studio focuses on mindfully, gently taught Hatha Yoga, and I'm often asked for recommendations of DVDs to practice with at home. This one will definitely be on my list! I'll be using this DVD in my own home practice on a regular basis!

Great for beginners, those recovering from injury, or for people who want to have a more meditative approach to practice.",1291334400,55,974,4.7514792899408285

3325688,5,B0012KK6QU,"I got this program precisely for its gentle, relaxing qualities.  I like to do a short yoga program before retiring to relax my body and unwind my mind. This program is perfect! I did it this morning just in case it would be too 'active' for sleep.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that savasana was a modified form of yoga nidra.  When Zyrka stated that the program was finished, I did not want to get up.  I was too relaxed...mentally and physically! If you are looking for something invigorgating, this is not the best program.  But then, Zyrka has others that fit that need.  If you want to 'lazily' stretch and flex and then feel totally relaxed, this is your program.  It starts off active and ends very passive.  It had the same impact on me as my first flight in a glider plane! (I had felt as though I were being rocked in cradle!)",1267315200,13,852,4.382165605095541

I love how I can choose two different practices for 30 min, two for 45 min and two for 60 min depending upon my mood or available time. I love how there is no cheesy music or ""spectacular"" background to detract from the program. She gives calm and helpful instruction throughout all the postures. She does NOT expect people to do a half a dozen downward facing dogs in a row. It seems to be geared for increasing flexibility and strength in a very measured, thoughtful approach that always makes me feel energized and peaceful after I have completed my practice. I would recommend this to anyone who feels like they need to start somewhere OR for those who have started but want to challenge themselves further as there is room to grow with this DVD.
