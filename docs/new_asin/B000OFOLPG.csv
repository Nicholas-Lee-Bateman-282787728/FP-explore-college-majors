8184889,5,B000OFOLPG,I wish Lidia came out with more of them in a more affordable format.  America's Test Kitchen offers their whole season on dvd at an affordable price.  I wish Lidia would do the same.  It is so much easier to get the hang of a recipe by watching someone rather than just reading it from a book.  She has a very warm and inviting personality and it is a pleasure to watch her dvds.,1214524800,3,379,4.081081081081081
8184890,1,B000OFOLPG,"I bought the first two pasta DVD sets for my mother for Christmas and then also the soup DVD.  My mom really enjoys Lidia and has really missed seeing her on TV.  I was so excited to be able to get them for her.

On the Amazon ad it shows the icon I'm use to watching for to tell me that the DVD will play in our region (US and Canada), but when we put them in her relative new five disc player, none of the discs would play.  They were not compatible and the cases had a different icon on it, from a university.

This is the first problem I have had with Amazon and I have been buying from this website for years and am now a prime member.  I don't really blame Amazon but I do believe that they need to indicate a more accurate icon on their ad.

Also, we received four, 26 minute discs in the first set...four episodes for $27.00!!!  I will be more careful reading the information for any Lidia product and now I have to come up with something else for my mom.

I'm sure Amazon will make it right but I won't be so trusting with the company that put these Lidia programs together.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lidia-s-Family-Table-Favorite-Pastas-Collection/dp/B000OFOLPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lidia's Family Table - Favorite Pastas Collection</a>",1199491200,5,1295,4.797297297297297
8184891,1,B000OFOLPG,"Let me begin by saying that I love what Lidia does- her recipes, her food, her approach to instruction - are all extremely satisfying. However, these DVD releases from Tavola Produtions/WHYY/American Public Television are money making schemes at their most contemptible!

My gripe with the Pasta 1 and 2 DVD releases (and my guess is the rest of the DVDs in this series are the same) is the price and what you get for it. For almost $28 per release, you only get 3 to 4 26-minute episodes. AND what's worse is that each short episode is on a separate disc. Considering that there are about 6 or so of these other DVDs out there at or around the same price, a Lidia-fan is looking at spending about $170 for this collection. Any of the Julia Child DVD releases cost about $30, but those contain 3 DVDs per set that come with about 6 episodes per DVD.

Tavola Productions must have forgotten that a DVD can hold almost 3 hours worth of material. My guess is that it must have been much cheaper to record one episode onto each DVD-R than involve a proper DVD designer in managing the process of getting many episodes on one, not to mention the absent recipes or any type of extras. Well, that's fine, but the price should reflect such a corner-cutting, amateurish product.

Perhaps Tavola Productions should have looked at Lidia's previous DVD release ""Favorite Recipes from Lidia's Italian Kitchen"" from 2003 which cost only $19.95 and has about 9 episodes on 1 DVD. I would highly recommend it one over this slipshod product any day.",1193702400,25,1532,4.604395604395604
