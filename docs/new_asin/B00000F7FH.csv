1204510,5,B00000F7FH,"This is the best subversive political film I've ever seen. It is the only film that puts sexuality in the political equation, much like Reich himself.
Throw surrealism, chaos, comedy into the mix and you have one hell of an experience.
The film starts out as a semi-documentry concerning the suppression of the life and works of Herr Reich, here in America, mostly, where he died in an American prison. It might be me, but it never really tells what his conviction was. Maybe, I'll watch it again. Obviously, because of his radical ideas and his past association with communism. The land of the free and the home of the brave, I guess.
There are many more sub-plots and characters dispersed throughout, but the film leaves the viewer with the impression that our society will never be truly free, and yes, Communism is held in as much contempt as Capitalism. Especially when tyrants are in power.
If you are a fan of artsy cinema off of the beaten path, you owe it to yourself to own this movie.
Features are wonderful and so is the film transfer and cleanup. Documentry and interview focus is on the director, as it should be. Highly recommended viewing experiece for discriminating adults",1189468800,3,1190,4.725961538461538
1204511,5,B00000F7FH,"wr: mysteries of the organism is above all else something of an experiment in narrative structure.. the movie begins curiously as a pseudo-documentary and ends as an absurd fictional account of a relationship in a communist country (hard to describe actually)... The film is also to my way of thinking highly comic.. there is a certain bunuel like surrealism particularly in the last scenes which almost explodes accross the screen in high contrast with the first part of the movie..
Criticisms abound for this film.. one being that it is a gross distortion of the theories of wilhelm reich.. My reaction to this is.. so what?? It is clear that this is going on and that this is a juxtaposition done for a larger purpose.. I mean do you think he structured the film the way he did for his own ideas of wilhelm reich? - perhaps - and is this subjective rendering artfully done - absolutely.. I see this as being a very thought provoking approach to making a movie.. and please do not discount the comic elements of the picture..",1186963200,4,1027,4.648351648351649
1204512,5,B00000F7FH,"It's the heart-breaking narrative of Reich's persecution interwoven with moments that highlight the absurdity of sex that make this work so powerful. I saw it first in 1980 in the UK and that screening still reverberates.

Nothing against Mr. DeMeo, who's posted a comment complaining that the film is not historically accurate. I used to subscribe to DeMeo's mailing list and found him a bit humorless. I think the whole *point* of this is that it's a work of art, not a documentarian's take on Reich's work.

Say what you will about Makaveyev's work as a whole, this one is a winner.",1105142400,34,585,4.7254901960784315
1204513,1,B00000F7FH,"This video was undertaken by Dusan Makavajev, who according to a 1971 film review article in the Journal of Orgonomy, obtained original footage of Reich from the Reich Museum, and interviews with various individuals who knew Reich and who had followed up on his research, by posturing as a ""friend of Reich"".  He then proceeded to mix that original footage with pornographic images designed to plunge a knife into the heart of everything Reich argued about, and stood for.  Only a few of Reich's genuine friends had the forethought to grant permissions based upon their approval of the final film - and they promptly refused such permission.  It caused an uproar among those who knew and understood Reich, but Makavajev got his footage and danced away a laughing man.  This film has done more damage to Reich's name and legacy than any single item one might point to, by distorting Reich's excellent and important biophysical work on the ""Function of the Orgasm"" (see book of this title) into a malignant advocacy of ""free sex for all"".  Reich would puke forever if he saw how his life's work was so badly twisted.  ""F--- Freely"" announces one of the heroes of this film, in a plot about an ice-skater who seduces, but then murders and decapitates one of the ""revolutionary proletariat"" female characters.  A weak ""plot"" indeed, interspliced with porno images from the plaster-casters, the first male erection to appear on a US film, masturbation images, and people group-fornicating to cartoon music -- Makavajev's apparent idea of the ""sexual revolution"" -- all under a smiling wall portrait of Reich.  ""Freedom Peddling"" is what comes to mind, and I can say with confidence that there is nothing of accuracy or authenticity about Reich in this film, aside from the interviews and short seconds of film from Reich's original archives, which were obtained by fraudulent means.  Reich's work informs us, that the pornographic character is a sexually-frustrated character, no less than the sex-negative moralist of the organized church, and that they are in fact mirror images of each other, flip sides of the same coin. ""Brothels are built from bricks of religion"" as the poet William Blake once said -- and Reich's clinical work put substance to this idea.  And so when this film was shown at my university years ago, the theatre was flooded with all the frustrated fraternity boys, come to hoot and ogle at the images of naked people.  They learned nothing.  Neither will anyone viewing this film, except perhaps how deceptive some Hollywood-types can be, even if they come from Yugoslavia.",1075593600,25,2592,4.9883990719257545
1204514,4,B00000F7FH,"I saw ""WR: Mystery of the Organism "" in my youth, say age 20, at a film festival one evening almost 30 years ago.  I do remember it having a strange effect on me and having stirred my original interest, delving into the work of (WR), Dr. Wilhelm Reich, the alleged mad scientist who died in prison for what he believed in.
I have read maybe 12 to 15 different books on the subject of ""Orgone Energy"" and the good doctor over time.  Some of WR's own works, which are psycho-sociological and way scientific at times, are a little hard to grasp. Mostly I've read the hip psuedo-scientific biographies and post-WR studies of which there were once several books available.
Some were especially written by the followers and practitioners of his life energy and psycho-sexual liberation work.  Though I remember the movie using just the more titillating portions of his theories as part of a spoof and sexual comedy, I still felt like there was a sense of truth and amazement implied in the use of them in the story. (Unlike the ""Orgasmatron scene"", a take off and exaggeration of his orgone accumulators, in Woody Allen's futuristic farce ""Sleeper"".)
I think there may be a documentary about the making of the movie ""WR"": out there as well?  I am suprised it or a revised production about Dr. Reich has not showed up on PBS or the Discovery Channel by now.
Anyway, I was glad to find that the VHS tape of the movie is available and am looking forward to seeing it again.",1027209600,17,1464,4.555133079847908
1204515,3,B00000F7FH,"Reykjavik, Iceland Film Festival, September, 2000.
I was not sure what to expect from this. I am a longtime fan and student of all things Yugoslavian. I had seen Makavejev's comparatively commercial film A Night of Love prior to screening two of his more obscure films, Sweet Movie, which is nothing less than visually frightening and decidedly disturbing, and this, Mysteries of an Organism. With more disturbing visual imagery and borrowings from surreal fantasy, the second half of the film is more like a ""film"" in that it tells a story of a Yugoslav woman, who, like all women portrayed in the film, is very sexually liberated, and claims that this is so because all women have been justly liberated by the revolution and socialism in Yugoslavia. When she meets a visiting Russian figure skater, she realizes that the Soviet ideals of socialism are limiting and lead only to repression of the self. She tries to teach him that love and socialism are not at odds with each other, but are indeed intertwined. When they finally make love, he ends up killing her because his passions and love have been so repressed. The first half of the film, which is a bit excessive and strange, is more documentary in style, but it does illustrate the points that are made more eloquently in the second half of the film by probing the life of a man (whose name i cannot recall) who was demonised by the US government.
The screening in Reykjavik was luckily accompanied by the director himself explaining his ideas and what he hoped to accomplish. This is a fascinating film, a total departure from American, or really, any other films of any genre or nationality.",980899200,37,1652,4.7595818815331015

7907210,5,B00000F7FH,"WR is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, but it also ranks among the best. Makavejev blends both documentary and fictional narratives to create a movie that examines how sex and politics fuse to create ""true revolutionaries"". This movie is not for those who are seeking a linear narrative or a movie that is easy to watch, it is challenging, but ultimately rewarding.

I screened this film for a class on Socialism and Feminism in Film, and what was interesting about this film compared to the majority of the films we screened was that this film, while critical of the realism of communist regimes, still supported a revolutionary lifestyle. This film was also firmly ground in theoretical concepts of Marxism and psychoanalysis--as demonstrated by the beginning portion on Reich--and it's interesting to pair this with another film that uses Reich's theories, The Raspberry Reich.",1249344000,,893,5.074829931972789

The main character is Milena Dravic, who shouts from her heavily populated apartment: ""Politics is for those whose orgasm is incomplete!""

The film is a blast at repression of any kind--political or moral--and a poem to uninhibited sexual intercourse... Repression sickens and enslaves, whereas nature's physical pleasure sets the human spirit free...

Philosophical film.  Each scene, side by side, brings upon new sensations, new bold images, political messages, honest truths about our culture all with the underlining sexual messages that make ""WR: Mysteries of the Organism"" more than just your average documentary.  Released in 1972 overseas and deeply rooted within art-house cinemas, ""WR"" is not a film for mass audiences, though; one could argue that it carries more honest truths today than it did when originally conceived.  Watching it today, in 2008, nearly thirty-six years later, it is difficult to watch.  Not that there is anything wrong with this cult masterpiece, it is a film that is not as ""modern"" with its voice as it is with its message.  As I do believe that this is an important film to watch, it may not initially show itself to you right away.  Like myself, it took nearly two viewings to fully understand the scope of ""WR: Mysteries of the Organism"" - nearly the same viewings that it took when originally watching ""8 "" or even ""Obscure Object of Desire"" - it isn't a film for just afternoon viewing - prepare yourself for cinematic intelligence on a grand scale.  This film forces you to think, look within the images, to break outside of your mold, and forces yourself out comfort zone.  This is ""WR: Mysteries of the Organism"", who would want anything else.

How deep does psychology have to go?  As the film asks this question, it feverously jumps from an American visual to a Yugoslavia political.  We go from our Reich-ian feminist who is in love with the ice-skater, to the simple stroll of our Warhol performer in New York, than haphazardly back to the demonstration in Yugoslavia.  As our sexual moments continue throughout, Makavejev uses them wisely (and symbolically) to make political and individual statements.  It is this juxtaposition that makes this film bold and expressive; growing into more than just your average ""I am Curious"" moment.  As any of our scenes nearly climax (literally and figuratively), Makavejev takes the moment to pull us back into the ""why"" of the scene.  It isn't American cinema, in which skin is used to fill theater seats, there is a point to the sex, and just as we think there is no rhyme to the reason, we are pulled back into Makavejev's flamboyant mind.  In essence, he is answering the age old question, ""do sex and politics really mesh""?  Then, seemingly out of nowhere, he pulls away the carpet giving us more than the original tantalizing scenes, but replacing them with horror and grotesque ... again - with a point.  To stress again why ""Mysteries of the Organism"" demands more than one viewing (nearly right after the initial viewing) is because it isn't just your average entertainment only film, Makavejev has put himself within the feature - giving us a short glimpse of personal ideals, sexual exploits, and the power of politics ... all within only about 85 minutes.  It is enough to give anyone a headache, but also excitement for what was missed.

Orgon Therapy?  Madness or Sane formulations?  ""WR"" questions Reich's ideals through faux-cinema and a sense of documentary styles.  While some of the history is shown through factual images, i.e. Stalin as a symbol of sex, it is the directed images that really add the value to ""Mysteries of the Organism"".  The drama of the characters that are represented demonstrate real life - the choices made and the consequences that follow.  It is more than just a handful of powerful scenes ... it is the option for viewers to discuss, have opinions, and agree/disagree.  As I throw out these random thoughts of this film, it only seems to fit that of our director.  This is not a linear film, but consistent imagery posted with symbolism.  Listening to the audio commentary, it seems to add the glue to these random tangents.  Criterion's addition of Richard Durgnat's words (read by Daniel Stewart), help the free-associated viewer deal with the deeper changes and movements within the film.  Overall, Criterion's addition of this film to its collection continues to show their excitement towards groundbreaking cinema, nearly forgotten through the modern CGI-explosive cinema bombarded today, ""WR: Mysteries of the Organism"" is difficult to watch, nearly too smart for my initial view - it is challenging because of the bold words, the wild symbolism, and that wild scene that uses the song ""Kill for Peace"".  Whew, perhaps this paragraph was random thoughts, but it seems to work with this feature.

Overall, in hopes not to bore the average reader, ""WR: Mysteries of the Organism"" is part black comedy, documentary, political collage, philosophical essay, and a bit of science fiction.  While these words hardly scratch the surface of what ""WR"" has to offer, this film is bizarre in a phenomenal way.  This isn't your average art-house picture, but instead a film that demands debate and pulls you within the film - pushing your mind, focusing your eyes, and challenging your intelligence.  Using political scenes that are dated, Criterion's release gives you the opportunity to explore from different angles, so that you can see the universal language that ""WR"" uses.  This is a challenging film.  It seems to be pulling from every genre, in a way that is difficult to explain.  The final scene of this film still remains in my mind, the stern Stalin image that leads us into a darker world.  I still don't think I fully understand what Makavejev was trying to say, but what astonished me about this film is that I didn't want to just put it aside.  ""WR"" pulls you, it yanks at your heartstrings, it opens your eyes, and one viewing is never enough for such a subtle (or is it?) engrossing film.  While it would not be for everyone, it still remains relevant today, and I am excited that Criterion has chosen to add it to their collection.  ""Mysteries of the Organism"" is an excellent film for those angered by the idiosyncratic destinies of Hollywood.

7907213,4,B00000F7FH,"WR: Mysteries of the Organism (Dusan Makavejev, 1971)

Dusan Makavejev has the greatest name in all filmdom. I get it stuck in my head on a regular basis. Which has absolutely nothing to do with WR: Mysteries of the Organism, Makavejev's best-known film and one that appears on an impressive number of thousand-best lists, as well as in Roger Ebert's book Great Movies. Makavejev took a page from Vilgot Sjoman's I Am Curious and spliced documentary with sex comedy, but where Sjoman's flick is an unwatchable mess that takes itself way too seriously, Makavejev's gets the spice blend just right and comes up with a winner. It took over three decades for the film to find its way to a widely-available American DVD (thank you, Criterion), but it was well worth the wait.

The documentary portion is about Wilhelm Reich, German philosopher and nutcase who built his entire philosophy around the idea of sexual freedom being related to a (non-existent) substance called orgone. (Reich's books on the subjects of both sexuality and orgone have been in print on and off ever since he wrote them, and shouldn't be hard to find at all; they make for highly amusing reading if you're a philosophy geek.) The Reich Foundation and Reichians around the globe had about the same reaction to it as did Makavejev's own government, who banned it in record time after its release. And to be fair to them, it's hard not to imagine the irrepressible Makavejev not snickering behind his hand in the editing room as he was cutting this flick. Then again, you've got to wonder how the subjects felt after viewing Errol Morris' far more serious Gates of Heaven.

The fictional bit is a classic tale of two friends who over the years have become very different, done Soviet-style-- one has become a rampant Socialist activist, while the other has become a crusader for sexual freedom. (Actually, the bits where the two philosophies collide and meld into one at an impromptu rally are far more convincing, if less realistic, than the documentary portions of the film.) The party girl has an affair with a famous Russian ice skater (cue huge amounts of subtext here), while her politically motivated friend tries to warn her away. Given the relationship between Russia and Yugoslavia, which is at the heart of Makavejev's film (both parts; Reich, whose philosophy attempted to unite Freudianism and Marxism, was castigated by Stalin), you know from the beginning that this cannot end well. The only suspense to be found is in wondering just how badly things will go. Which means you're sitting there watching a funny, sexy film and just waiting for the shoe to drop-- so that when it does, the effect is all the more devastating despite you knowing it's coming.

Deeply felt, powerful, and well worth watching even if you know nothing whatsoever about Soviet politics during the Cold War. ****",1219104000,8,2869,4.872950819672131
7907214,5,B00000F7FH,"I was lucky enough to see WR for the first time at a film festival run by the Institute for Sexual Research (now the Kinsey Institute) at Indiana University when I was an undergraduate there. I saw it for a second time in Albany, NY at a New York Writer's Institute showing complete with the presence of the director himself, the great Dusan Makavejev. The film has stuck with me ever since.

Yes, its not a Hollywood film with a nice little o so fake narrative tied up in colourful ribbons and bows. Yes, its not a documentary of Wilhelm Reich and shouldn't be viewed as such; only a true believer could mistake it as such or condemn it for not treating the totem figure with an aura of sacredness. What it is is the best collage satire (Vertov meets Bunuel if  you need a label you can get a handle on) I have ever seen. Though Sweet Movie has garnered more viewer comments for me WR is Makavejev's high water mark.
