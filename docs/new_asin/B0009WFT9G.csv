8068037,5,B0009WFT9G,I love this. Even tho it is region 2 which meant that I had to purchase an all region player.,1501027200,,93,3.7
8068038,5,B0009WFT9G,"Jean Michel Jarre has even mentioned that he enjoys performing in America.  So why isn't he making some sort of effort to get his DVD's released over here in the US?

There are several Jean Michel Jarre shows that are available and viewable only in Europe.  Jarre's ""Oxygene Moscow"" is the only NTSC DVD available in the US.

I guess I'm going to have to invest in a Region Free DVD player if all my favorite artists are only available on DVD in Europe.  This applies to Mike Oldfield too.",1199145600,,489,4.388888888888889

18 - Oxygene 12

19 - Rendez-vous 4

The DVD includes also a Behind the Scenes documntary.

Very good sound(although no DTS) and image.

The European release(zone 2) includes also a CD from the live performance.

A must for the Jarre fans, although it can be argued if this is the best DVD up to now; personally I prefer more the ""Live in Pekin"", but I wouldn't miss this one either.

Let's hope we will see on DVD more of his concerts-La Defense, Huston, etc. I'm ready to buy them all!",1141516800,4,1123,4.274038461538462
8068041,5,B0009WFT9G,Dear All. I've bought the Solidarnosc Live DVD a couple weeks ago. Truly this is the best JMJ live performance so far...It's more than just 15/$25 worth of music disc. I strongly recommend it to everyone! (The only thing I regret is that I didn't go to Poland last year to see it live!),1140825600,10,286,4.314814814814815
