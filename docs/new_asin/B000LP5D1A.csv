8162553,2,B000LP5D1A,"Released in 2007 and written/directed by Mark Allen, Delirium is a slasher flick about six bickering college youths in Southern California who breakdown in the desert on their way to San Diego for Spring Break. As they try walking to the nearest town a mad slasher attacks.

This movie was shot in 8.5 days and reportedly cost a little less than $9000; Im sure most of that was spent on wages, lodging & catering for the cast/crew. In light of this, you have to be braced for no-budget quality, like hand-held digital cams, inconsistent sound quality, lame & redundant non-score, dubious acting, tedious pacing, eye-rolling dialogue and so on. If you can handle these weaknesses, there are some rewarding elements to Delirium.

Some of the dialogue between the youths is bad and unrealistic, like when the group arrives at the diner and the following conversation at the table. This, generally speaking, shows that the characters are slasher archetypes rather than real people. You have the rash alpha male who thinks with his fists, the promiscuous (supposed) hottie, the geek, the token black dude, the man-hating lesbian and the semi-virginal female protagonist. Most of these archetypes were later showcased in the satirical The Cabin in the Woods (2012). While most of these characters are also stereotypes, two of them definitely arent. Both the female protagonist (Tallia Cuellar) and the black guy (Donovan Smith) are fleshed-out quite well by the end and have some good dialogues, particularly a well-done conversation in the last act. Both are actually pretty decent actors. The Sheriff (Mike Burnell) is even better and is obviously a professional actor. Burnell had to pull-off numerous solo scenes and does so convincingly.

The opening & ending credits song by Splitfinger is heavy, raw, primal and excellent (in fact, its almost worth the price of admission) whereas the non-score is, at best, serviceable, albeit redundant (Im sure Allen was shooting for a Jaws-like musical motif). Unfortunately, most of the happenings during the first hour are uneventful and tedious, but I suppose it could be argued that the movie DOES put you where the kids are  stuck in the open desert, bored, frustrated, and trying to find a way out.

As hinted above, I didn't find the blond hottie hot, but you might find her appealing if you like tall, thin women. The lesbian character is a turn-off because shes so hateful and one-dimensional, but then I found myself having compassion for her by the climax because it becomes clear what brought her to where she is. Tallia Cuellar is, by far, the best of the women. Shes not blow-your-mind ravishing or anything, but shes a quality actress and her character is likable and unique.

The action/gore sequences are nothing to write home about, but they're not bad either considering the non-budget. I laughed at a couple of the slayings or near-slayings, particularly the meat cleaver and kitchen knife episodes. The reason my title blurb says The Shadow knows is because thats curiously who the murderer looks like, The Shadow. By the way, youll suspect who the killer is before the first act is over.

Micro-budget films can be quite good, as 2006 The Lonely Ones and 2013s Another Kind attest, but those flicks cost $100,000 and $120,000 respectively. Delirium had less than a tenth of that to work with (!). Ive seen do-it-yourself flicks that cost around what Delirium cost and they totally sucked. Delirium doesnt suck as bad and has a good message at the end thats almost enlightening (notice I said almost). If I were to rate it in comparison to other independent flicks that cost about the same amount Id give it a solid grade of B. My lower grade below is in relation to slasher flicks in general and overall entertainment value.

To get anything good from Delirium you have to be able to acclimate to its almost-no budget style and limitations. I did and therefore did.

The film runs 80 minutes and was shot in the Ocotillo, California, region.

8162559,4,B000LP5D1A,"The film is a stinker, don't let anyone fool you. I loved this film because it classifies as ""so bad it is good."" As such I might toss a plot spoiler at you.

Six college kids who don't all know each other, travel to San Diego for a break before exams. Kirk (Louie Del Monico) is driving the Mustang and is a steroid a-hole. His girlfriend Reyna (Wren Napier) is a spoiled rich kid. Sandra (Heather Self) has her eye on Lucy (Tallia Cuellar) who tells her she is straight. She takes a liking to Brad (Donovan Smith) our urban representative. Dennis (Luke Slinko) is the picked on geek. Only Scooby-Doo could not see all the clues tossed at us about what was to happen.

Our gang who is already at each other throats, stop at a restaurant where you have to turn the sound up to hear the conversation. They get directions for a shortcut through the desert and are told not to go. Who was surprised when the Ford broke down?

First off the acting was really bad. Heather Self was laughable. The film also gives us a sighting of what looks like slender man, the alter ego of the killer, which we had pegged in the first two minutes...okay maybe three. However what really caused me to laugh out loud was the sound effects man. Rick Bowman take a bow.

The sound was very choppy in addition to the bad sound at the restaurant. The Mustang sounded like it was throwing a rod when a hose clamp came off.  When the gang was walking down some railroad tracks, it was loud and sounded more like an army marching. What really made me laugh were the typical hitting sound effects that go with a fight. We get that hard skin on skin punching sound when there is a soft knee jab to the gut.

Brad let's us know there are two types of rich people. Those that use wealth to enrich themselves and those use wealth to define themselves. And there was one scene I had to rewind and watch again. Yes it was the nude scene, but it was the hard core talk that went with it, and not the visual.

Guide: F-bomb. Nudity (Wren Napier)  4 stars for the wrong reasons.",1448323200,,2040,4.28051948051948
8162560,4,B000LP5D1A,"If you like low budget B horror flicks, this is a movie for you. Shot in a stark, almost documentary style and with realistic violence and gore, this slasher picture is reminiscent of indie 70's horror like the original TEXAS CHAN SAE MASSACRE and the original THE HILLS HAVE EYES. The beginning is kinda slow, but once you get to the killings, its a freakin' bloodbath.",1243123200,,370,4.621212121212121
