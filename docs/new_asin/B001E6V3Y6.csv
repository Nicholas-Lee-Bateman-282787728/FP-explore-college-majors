Just like most movies it does deviate a little from the story, but overall it stayed true to the story line. I was so excited when I discovered that this video existed because I try to give my students as many visuals as possible. Great movie to go with a great story.",1419379200,,362,4.185714285714286

8296937,5,B001E6V3Y6,"This short film was a great supplement to reading the short story with my class of special needs students. It opens with a blues number, which immediately gains the attention of the students since they are visual and auditory learners. The film closely follows the story line, with minor changes, as films do but nothing major. The best part is that it was both long and short enough to keep the attention of the class. I enjoyed it and wished I could incorporate more short pieces to supplement learning and teaching.",1237075200,12,518,4.7032967032967035
