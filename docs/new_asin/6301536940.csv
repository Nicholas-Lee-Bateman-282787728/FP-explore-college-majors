339168,4,6301536940,"I had the original ""Prime Time"" workout VHS tape for 16 years and used it so much I wore mine out too.  This workout is a great workout for all parts of your body. The aerobic part is short but challenging. The sit ups,ballet bar and leg work really make you feel like you are making progress but without being too hard core. (I usually fast fwd thru the arm work because I find it boring)

After using this tape consistently you may find that you'll need to move on to something a little more challenging.  This is a good tape to fall back on when you have had a lapse in exercise and need to get back on track. I really like it. I was really happy to see that it is offered on Amazon.",1108080000,8,686,4.029411764705882

as I CAN keep up with Jane/Shirlee(Jane's Sis)/M'Liss/Herb (""our

jumping comes in. This is a very effective workout & I LOVE IT!
I know it by heart & I enjoy doing my routine early in the Morning. I have a lot of Fonda vids & I crack up when I see all
the Hairstyles she has in her Retrospect! LOL! When I was ill in

The class is helping me cope with fibromyalgia/chronic  fatigue/myofacial pain syndrome. You too may find this a rewarding class.  If you need a workout to help chronic illness try this one. I love it.  thanks Jane...,952300800,20,379,4.890625
339173,4,6301536940,"This used to be titled her Prime Time Workout.  This is a great workout for those who want a slower to do routine than Jane's other workouts, especially the ones made around the time this was.  It's easier and less  challenging, but beware this is NOT easy.  This really requires you to be  able to do aerobics and do moves that only flexible and limber people can.  This is still a wonderful routine to do aside from that.  Soft and vibrant  music and good length makes this an enjoyable class.",936403200,15,495,4.4222222222222225

339238,5,6301536940,"I used to do this workout with my mom years ago, when I was around junior-high age!  I am now 40, and thanks to my physically demanding job, my body is not what it used to be.  I had to give up my beloved running because it kills my back and hurts my joints.  I have to modify the cardio in this workout because any sort of impact makes me suffer the painful consequences later. Jane shows how to modify with the help of Hazel, the woman in class who also avoids impact.  Anyway I love this workout.  She does a lot of stretching moves so you can work on your stiffness and get that nice muscle relaxation.  I can do it in the privacy of my own home.  I like that they weren't afraid to get a little goofy back then.  Seems like fitness stars have to be so serious and ""cool"" now.  This workout was just what I needed this morning.  Enough to limber me up, get some blood moving but not kill me.  I'm so glad these workouts are on DVD now.  For us children of the 80s, it's a bit of nostalgia.",1482710400,,993,4.010204081632653

339243,4,6301536940,"This is really a great workout.  A lot of it seems ballet-based.  The aerobic portion can be high impact if you want, or you can modify it for low impact.  The workout is very comprehensive and targets every area of the body, and has a lot of variety so it's not boring.  But as other reviewers have mentioned, the sound mix is bad.  The music is way too loud and it's hard to hear Jane's instructions.  After you memorize the routine, I suppose you could turn the whole thing down, but I really hope they correct the audio problem and reissue the DVD.",1469232000,3,552,4.310679611650485

The issue with this video is that the audio is hard to hear. There is jazz music playing loudly over Jane. Also, the closed captions are messed up. There is a 10-15 second delay on what Jane is saying. So it is hard to follow the video, and you always have to have your eyes on the video or you will miss something.

339497,4,6301536940,"This was originally Jane's Prime Time Workout that she made in 1984, not to be confused with her newer ones she made a few years ago. It is a 45 minute workout that focuses on stretching with a high impact aerobic section. Not extreme aerobics, but a lot of jumping, and twisting that my arthritic knees cannot handle any longer. There is a woman you can follow that does low impact if this part is too hard for you to do. She also does some resistance exercises standing with a chair that are 'knee challenging' at least for me. Her other workouts do similar exercises on the floor which I prefer.
This workout is good for all ages, but if you have any type of knee problems, it might not be for you. I prefer her original and newer prime time workouts.",1422230400,18,754,4.316901408450704
339528,5,6301536940,"I have her newest Prime Time, and was a fan in the 80's (I was 20 in 1982..)... I have done her workouts all these years, have all the VHS, and now that she finally has put the older ones (which are JUST as good , even better than most, as any current product on the market for exercise)..  on DVD, I bought them all.  I am now 53, and ""Look"" ok, I've been up and down the last 8 years, battling age, fibromyalgia, depression, arthritis, overeating compulsion (I never had in my 20's - 40's)... as the hormones change, I find exercise isn't as ""Fun"" as it used to be, but absolutely necessary, since I refuse to take medications, and want to age as naturally as possible.  I eat healthy, drink tons of water and have to exercise daily to manage the pain, to feel better, and keep fit.

This particular program I never got the pleasure of using in my earlier years, and wish I had.  Jane Fonda is one of the best instructors in the industry!  My next favorite is Chaleene Johnson, and then Jillian MIchales.  All 3 give constant ques, for proper form, for encouragement, explain why and what the exercises and positions do...  they remind constatnly to stay in form, and all their ""Models"" demonstrate proper form.  Jane Fonda's programs (even from the 80's - 90's) stand up to any today.  She has all ages, sizes, colors, levels of fitness, and shapes in all her DVD's , so with visual proof, she lets us all know anyone can do this.  She shows modifications (which all 3 ladies do in all the DVD's I have used)

I have been seriously into  fitness from 1980-2005, then got so much on my plate (life, illness, etc.) I gave up on myself for a few years, grew 7 sizes, and  I am now recouperating (down 7 sizes since 2005) and taking my health and fitness day by day, and learning how to really use exercise as my medication, and to ""age well"" as Jane says.

This particular exercise program anyone can do.  it is 45 minutes long, but as I have learned the last few years, any execise (even 5 minutes) is better than nothing, it creates endorphins, eases pain, gives the body needed stress relief, energy, oxygen, (and so much more) so one can play the DVD for 5, 10, 15 etc.  minutes, or do just a certain section..  not necessary to do the entire 45 minutes  (altyhough it speeds by, and one feels AWESOME after )

This program (as any ) can be done slowly, at your own pace, or intensely, you can use bands, ankle or arm / hand weights if you want more resistance, and added 'cardio'... all movements are smooth, well explained, and have a purpose.  It improves posture, mood, muscle...  There is no ""jumping"", no ""pushing hard"", no ""intensity"" (other than your own level or choice).. it's perfect for any age, level, shape, size, etc..

Since 2005 I have been forcing myself to exercise daily, its taken a while to get back in the habit, and actually start enjoying it.  I clearly see the difference in pain and mood levels when I do and do not exercise (even 5 minutes of anything.. stretching).. I have slowly been doing more exercise, I started with ""Sit and be Fit"", on TV, and then some other yoga type programs, then walking more, then ""Classical Stretch"", and found that with the fibromyalgia, 30 minutes or less is benificial, any more and I get really sore for a few days after (not the ""good"" muscle burn sore, but sore, pain aches, in nerves, ligaments, tendons, joints..)..  I have since 2007 - done ""Supreme 90"" a few times.. , Hip Hop Abs, Brazil Butt LIft, Turbo Kick, Jillians DVD's, Combat, Yoga, Pilates, Total Gym, Rebound, Ballet, Tracey Mallet, Tracey Anderson, Bosu, Turbo Fire, Rev Abs, (the best of my ability for each day.. ) .  I have been doing daily exercise, and feel good most days (depending on what I choose to eat..)..  Acute insomnia is almost all gone, I sleep fairly well now.

I did this full program, and was ""muscle sore"", the next day, it was a great feeling.  Change = change ( I was a ""trainer and group instructor for a few years as well), which is why I change up my rountines regularly.. I was surprised that these gentle movemnts in this DVD would give me such a great feeling the next day..

The moves really work / strech muscles, ligaments and tendons deep down, working with breath and absolute correct posture and form, that are often forgotten, and left out of the 'traditional' (exhaust and work the large muscles only) exercise programs available.

There are  12 ""sections""
1. start / warm up
2. stretch 5 minutes
3. leg w/chair or support 8 minutes (ballet like stretches for tendons, building heat, getting blood flow, warming up body, balance, co-ordination, toning)
4. arm / shoulder 5 minutes (great exercises for toning the arms)
5. waist 3 minutes
6. cardio 7 minutes (simple , basic dance movements)
7. post aerobic stretch 5 minutes
8. floor stretching / legs / keagle exercises 4 minutes
9. abs / stretch 3 minutes
10. inner thigh / buttox 3 minutes
11. cool down / stretch 3 minutes
12. standing breath 1 minute",1421884800,32,4978,4.490566037735849

We used to do this exercise routine once a day.  It is geared so  that everyone can do most or all or it from the git-go without the need to be really fit.  Now that I am a senior, I am again doing it pretty much every day ... not so much to keep the weight down, but more importantly, to keep the joints limber.  And the greatest advantage a video has over a private trainer is: When you've done enough, you can say ""Go home, Jane!"".",1358726400,43,578,3.9310344827586206

I used to find the arm exercises boring, too, but trust me on this. Once you have arthritis in your hands, and neck pain that gives you shoulder pain, you'll appreciate how good these exercises are.

  Jane does a lot of stretching that makes me feel great on this video. She does a lot of ballet moves and toning. The aerobics portion is also very nice. Me and my mother love doing this tape.

The quality of Jane's videos still holds up all these years later, better than anything I could have found at wal-mart or best buy.",1120089600,9,556,4.485148514851486
