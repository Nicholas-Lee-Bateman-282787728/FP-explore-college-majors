4048340,5,B00317LM7Y,"What can you say about Simon and Simon, except that it was one of the best detective shows on TV in the 80's.  You really believed these guys were brothers.  Who know that in real life they were the same age within a couple of months?

All the seasons were at their best, no one season stands out really.  It was not over acted, not over dramatic, and it made you laugh.  The Simon Brothers were very endearing characters, and their mother Cecelia was a crack-up.

And anyway, was there anyone better looking than Jameson Parker in the 80's?  I don't think so !!",1270512000,12,562,4.346153846153846
4048341,5,B00317LM7Y,This  show was a lot of fun. I have something to pointout to one revewer though. Jim Rockford Didn't have money eather or fancy clothes his best frends ranged from Det. Becker to Trying to go strat(somewhat)Conartest Angel Martain. His trailer was in a parking lot of a restarant on the Beach in L.A.BelAir Calf. He's a pardend excon. His Long suffering Dad a retired truckdriver. There Not Rich. The show started in 1974.you can see it on tv at times. oh (Garald McRaney)Rick Simon)got his start on sevral guest shots on the show and the lady who played there mom mrs.simon also did a guest Shot on The Rockford Files.,1262563200,,619,4.576576576576577

4048343,4,B00317LM7Y,"I can hardly wait till this 1984-85 Season of SIMON & SIMON gets released on DVD in April of 2010 since this private detective drama seemed to have gotten better each season along with the fact that this private-eye program was unique in many ways.

Because for one thing, this was definitely one of the first detective shows without a private investigator working solo since the short-tempered cowboyish ex-Marine Vietnam veteran & gonzo P.I. Rick Simon(Gerry McRaney)and his often fastidious kid brother A.J. Simon(Jameson Parker)worked together on cases as opposed to Rockford(James Garner), Magnum(Tom Selleck), Houston(Lee Horsley), and Mannix(Michael Connors)which were all private detectives who worked alone.

For another, SIMON & SIMON was also the first and only detective show about 2 brothers who ran a private investigations agency together as opposed to THE ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, PI, MATT HOUSTON, and MANNIX.

For another, the Simon Bros. ran a private-eye office of their own together in Downtown San Diego as opposed to Rockford and Magnum who didn't even have an office.

For another SIMON & SIMON was one of the first shows and the only detective drama to ever take place here in America's Finest City(San Diego)instead of L.A. or New York or even San Francisco since most movies and TV programs take place in the L.A. Area or New York City.

For another, Rick and A.J. Simon didn't have money, fancy cars, or even cool clothes for that matter either, but Rick & AJ had brains and talent just like Rockford did which helped them solve cases they were hired to do, despite the friction, the rivaly, their love/hate relationship, and the fall-outs that often occurred between Rick and A.J. along with the fact that the Simon brothers lived on a shoe-string budget kind of like Rockford, Magnum, and Mannix did.

SIMON & SIMON was also like a spin-off of MAGNUM, P.I. along with the fact that SIMON & SIMON made its debut on CBS in November of 1981 which was a year later after MAGNUM made its debut on CBS in December of 1980.

Additionally, SIMON & SIMON was almost like THE ROCKFORD FILES times two in a way along with the fact that Rick & AJ Simon had their streetwise cop buddy Lt. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Timothy Reid)at San Diego P.D. to help them solve their investigations just like the often dry-humored Jim Rockford had his often agitated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)at the LAPD, along with the fact that Rockford was also a former Vietnam vet and private dick that didn't make a lot of money either just like the Simon brothers didn't.

Rick & AJ also lived an eccentric lifestyle like Rockford did too since Rick lived on a boat in AJ's backyard in Venice just like Rockford always kept his gun in a cookie-jar & lived in a ragged trailer in a parking lot in Malibu by the beach barely able to make ends meet.

It was also nice being able to watch each episode of this detective drama complete & uncut like they were shown on their original air-dates on CBS as well as commercial-free as opposed to how they were shown on WGN and A&E which provided too many deleted scenes with too many commercial interruptions.

So for those of you classic private detective drama fans out there, MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 will be released on DVD on March 9th, 2010 which is only 4 weeks before SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 gets released on DVD, which brings us 2 private eye dramas underway for us to look forward to next Spring.",1261699200,13,3448,4.750836120401337

4048349,4,B00317LM7Y,"""Simon & Simon"" was such a splendid, humorous, unique and fun detective television series.

Jameson Parker was perfect in the role of private investigator A.J. Simon.
Gerald McRaney was perfect in the role of private investigator Rick Simon.

The reason why I rated this ""Simon & Simon: Season Four"" DVD set just four stars is due to it including two syndicated episodes.

The fourth season of ""Simon & Simon"" originally aired on CBS from September 27, 1984 until March 28, 1985.

Here are the exact running times for all 21 episodes from ""Simon & Simon: Season Four"" on this Shout! Factory DVD release.

Disc 1:
C'est Simon - 1:35:50
A Little Wine with Murder - 45:04
The Dark Side of the Street - 48:05

Our Fair City - 45:02

Revolution #9 1/2 - 48:01

Disc 4:
Yes, Virginia, There is a Liberace - 48:01

The Mickey Mouse Mob - 48:02

Disc 6:
Mummy Talks - 48:00
Marlowe, Come Home - 48:03
Out-of-Town Brown - 48:02

The picture quality and audio quality on this DVD set are both good.

In the episode ""Who Killed the Sixties?"", The Mamas & the Papas' hit song ""California Dreamin'"", The Beach Boys' hit song ""Good Vibrations"",
Shirley Ellis' hit song ""The Name Game"", The Association's hit song ""Cherish"" and Bob Dylan's hit song ""The Times They Are a-Changin'""
 were all left intact.

The packaging that Shout! Factory used for ""Simon & Simon: Season Four"" is perfect.
There is a cardboard slip-cover case that holds three different slim plastic DVD cases inside.
All three of the slim plastic DVD cases hold two discs each.

4048353,5,B00317LM7Y,"The fourth season of TV's best-ever buddy-detective series features the usual fast-moving, creative scripting, snappy dialogue, abundance of action and humor, and also plenty of the relationship (as the fandom used to call it) and a good share of backstory (jncluding Parker in a dual role as A.J. and his father, Jack).  Laid-back cowboy Rick Simon (Gerald McRaney) and his button-down preppy brother A.J. (Jameson Parker), partners and best friends, tackle 20 quirky cases in 21 episodes, including a young executive who's afraid his upcoming wedding may be postponed forever by someone out to kill him, a pair of battling formerly-husband-and-wife stage actors in need of executive protection, a wide-open town whose mayor has barely escaped several attempts on his life, a little girl who wants Santa Claus to bring her missing father home for Christmas, a soft-spoken ornithologist who's been accused of being an international jewel thief, and a mummy which may or may not be that of the Pharaoh Akhenaten.  They reconnect with A.J.'s old high-school flame, whose beloved brother may have died in a way unsuspected for almost 20 years, and with their ne-er-do-well, globe-trotting Uncle Ray Simon, who involves them in a messy political situation on a remote South Pacific island; they race against time to prove that Rick didn't kill the loan-company exec who repossessed his cabin cruiser.  This season includes several landmarks: it's the only one to boast *two* double episodes (the opener, C'Est Simon, in which the boys are called to Paris when their father's old World War II buddy (who happens to be courting their mother) suddenly vanishes (the '84-5 season saw several CBS shows sending their regulars to Europe for one reason or another), and the January-sweeps two-parter, Simon Without Simon, in which, having accidentally broken a major espionage case, the resulting publicity and adulation convinces them that, as A.J. says, what each of us needs is no longer what both of us need); Gerald McRaney directs a segment (the dark-toned Slither, a story about runaway teens and drug runners), and Tim Reid (Downtown Brown) scripts one (Out-of-Town Brown, in which Brown and the brothers try to help the plainclothesman's cousin, a veterinary student at a rural college up north.  Marc Tubert returns twice as the Simons' trauma-surgeon friend Dr. Suvi Raj, a.k.a. Captain Midnight of County General, and of course Mary Carver is on hand as feisty, supportive Cecelia Simon.  As always, the scams and disguises the brothers use are among the high points: Rick's turn as Mr. Boyer, the man who computerized the cattle industry, in C'Est Simon, is not to be missednor is his and A.J.'s as mercenaries in search of illicit arms (one German, one suspiciously resembling Indiana Jones).  Even 30 years after it was filmed, despite the short skirts and oversize shoulder-padded jackets of the women and the universality of pay phones, S&S still holds up.",1425859200,,2962,5.160416666666666

4048373,5,B00317LM7Y,This is a good addition to the series and is for anyone who likes the series.  The brothers have their problems but things work out by the end of each episode.

I really enjoy watching each episode and seeing how these brothers are able to overcome all adversities that arise and remain partners and brothers.,1346112000,,478,4.6
4048374,4,B00317LM7Y,Simon & Simon was one of my favorite detective shows from the 1980s.  It featured two likeable and witty leads.  The banter between the two brothers made the show.  It also had pretty good writing in general.,1342051200,,208,4.5675675675675675
4048375,3,B00317LM7Y,"This season for me is the weakest of the entire series. I found some episodes to be simply boring, others were just average. There were 2 or 3 good episodes but even they had flaws. And the slapstick comedy really turned me off and may have been one of the main reasons why creator Philip DeGuere was fired at the conclusion of the season. The 2-hour opener ""C'est Simon"" for me becomes a bit of a bore half-way through. Other episodes I find to be completely boring are ""Break a Leg, Darling"", ""Revolution #9 1/2"", ""Enter The Jaguar"", and ""Mummy Talks"". The ""Simon Without Simon"" 2-parter is only average and as with ""Ces't Simon"" I found myself getting bored with the story by the end of the first part. As I said the slapstick comedy reached it's peak with season 4 and usually invovled situations with Tim Reid's character, of course their was humor in seasons 5 and 6, but it wasn't over-the-top like it is in season 4. One of the best episodes is ""Slither"", but even this one has a noticeable macho theme that dominates almost the entire episode, especially near the end when they question Randall Deeds character. All-in-all I'd have to say that Simon & Simon Season 4 is an average season that contains average storylines, some boring episodes, only 2 or 3 good episodes and over-the-top humor. For hardcore fans only",1323129600,,1325,4.61864406779661

4048377,5,B00317LM7Y,"This is by far the best season yet. The writing only gets better and the storylines really balance the mystery and intense moments with humor.

A couple of episodes are from the syndicated run because Shout! was unable to locate the original prints. I like that they do not hide that fact from the consumer. I also appreciate the fact that they included the episodes instead of skipping over them. Nice touch!

Season Five is only available through Shout! Factory direct. It includes each episode from that season and Shout! has also added the reunion movie.

In addition, Shout! Factory announced the release of Season 6 through TVShowsOnDVD recently only to issue a retraction almost immediately stating that they have no plans to release Season 6 (full season) or Seasons 7 and 8 (half season each).

Let's hope they reconsider because Season 6 is rated as one of the best seasons and one of the episodes they licensed from Season 8 has never been seen. CBS never aired it after they canceled the series.",1313366400,5,1007,4.7701149425287355

4048383,5,B00317LM7Y,"Successful long-running TV series have a predictable arc; a season or two of developing a unique style; then two or three fabulous seasons when the chemistry is nearly perfect and everything 'works'; then a decline, as strong original scripts are harder to find, 'message' episodes replace sparkle with dark drama, and the charm that made the series a hit is lost, resulting in lower ratings and cancellation. This formula certainly applies to ""Simon & Simon"", but the good news is, ""Simon & Simon: Season Four"" is certainly part of the series' peak, when Rick and A.J. were truly magical, and the San Diego detectives had a fan base nearly as avid as ""Magnum P.I.""

With the addition of Tim Reid as Det. ""Downtown"" Brown in Season 3, all the elements for a first-class show were in place, and Season 4 celebrated with a season premiere on location in Paris! More of the mysterious backstory of the boys' father, Jack Simon, an O.S.S. operative in WWII, is introduced, in flashback (Jameson Parker plays dual roles). If you were an adult in 1984, as I was, you may find yourself dumbfounded at how lax airport security was, back then, and how naive we were about terrorism. When Brown walks through the Orly Passenger Terminal with a suitcase full of weapons, I admit, I shuddered!

There are, happily, few other moments quite as bittersweet; a 1960s 'flashback' episode is quite entertaining and actually important to the series, reconciling the somewhat differing backstories of Rick's youth, as portrayed over the first three seasons (a biker who fled to Canada with a low draft number, then returned to California and enlisted in the Marines, serving in Special Ops in 'Nam). A humorous moment, showing how cheap gas was in 1965, compared to 1984 (55 cents vs. $1.24, a gallon), is even more ironic, now ($1.24 to nearly $4.85, a gallon)!

The one Season 4 'message' episode, as Rick and A.J. track a missing high school girl, framed in a drug bust, is quite effective, as A.J. has a scary reaction when dosed at a restaurant with angel dust, the arrest of the bad guys clearly isn't going to solve the issues, raised, and Rick, A.J., and Brown tell the girl, bluntly, that the odds of her actually beating an addiction problem are not good. Powerful stuff, in the Reagan era!

There are many wonderful moments, with the boys, wonderful Mary Carver as their feisty, strong-willed mom, and Rick's big ol' lovable mutt, Marlowe (who even stars in his own late-season episode about dog shows and dognapping...it WILL bring a tear to your eye, Marlowe is a scene stealer!) The boys' new office is the most upscale, yet, but don't worry, they still trash it, and Rick still can't buy a piece of electronics from Carlos that works!

A kudo to Shout Factory for using broadcast versions of a few episodes missing the original master (they really do put the fans, first, as I'd rather see an abridged version than no episode, at all!), and an oft-requested plea...PLEASE bring Jameson Parker and Gerald McRaney in to do commentaries (and Tim Reid and Mary Carver, too, if possible!!!)
