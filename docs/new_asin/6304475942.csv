7872439,5,6304475942,"WHY won't they put this on DVD?! I have an old deteriorating VHS version from the 80s . . . in addition to all the other lovely things (an old Dusenberg, a PTC menagerie carousel now over 100 years old), this program has a fabulous segment on the restoration of Tsarskoe Celo (the ""Catherine Palace""), the Russian palace where the last Emperor and his family spent their days outside St. Petersburg before the Revolution. What the revolutionaries didn't destroy, the Nazis totally trashed, and this program shows a FORTY YEAR restoration of this world-heritage site . . . in the show they say it will take another 20 to finish it off, so it should be done by now.",1379116800,,663,4.579831932773109
7872440,5,6304475942,"This is a nice little documentary touching on several antique items. There's a segment on a Curtiss Jenny biplane, an antique carrousel, etc. You only get a few minutes on each but it's nicely done. I was mainly interested in Ken Hyde's segment about restoring his rare Curtiss JN-4 Jenny. It was worth it to see the plane in slow flight and hear and see the exposed valve action on the engine, things you don't get from still photos.",1344470400,,434,4.506329113924051
7872441,5,6304475942,"Any time this show has been aired, I have dropped what I was doing to watch. For anyone who has rehabilitated, rescued or restored any kind of antique, this video is a must. My favorite segment is the Catherine Palace.  Given the extent of damage suffered during the siege of Leningrad (which is  shown)during World War II, restoration would have seemed impossible. It is  wonderful to see the original beauty re-emerging through the efforts of a  small army of restorers. None of the depicted projects was completed  overnight and this video shows what patience and persistence can yield. I  highly, highly recommend this video.",960854400,2,629,5.0
