I found this item by chance while looking up the films of Charles Durning. The plot appeared that it might be of some interest. This film was described as ""a thriller with a message."" Three women, who had been expecting to abort their babies, wake up to find that they -- along with a doctor -- have been kidnapped by what they believe to be a fanatical anti-abortion group. Their ""jailer"" addresses them from a closed-circuit television. It is his intention to compel them to go through with their unwanted pregnancies and deliver their babies. Instead of your usual horror fare, the women are dressed in nightgowns and fed decent food, while reading and watching propaganda on why abortion is bad.

They are shown purportedly video taped messages from their families and they settle into a routine. Inevitably, they go into labour -- simultaneously! The babies are delivered -- one woman (the most outspoken pro-abortionist of the three) gives birth to twins.

Afterwards, the one who had twins is sick and in pain. After examining her, the doctor is dumbfounded to discover something that she says ""is impossible."" She informs the woman she is still pregnant. The woman says ""it can't be."" Suddenly the two other women are gone; it turns out that the woman had died on the abortion table and the doctor had committed suicide -- they are, and always have been, in Hell.

The story for most of the film went along a clear and straight forward premise. It turned out to be a blas story with little intrigue for the most part. But the twist at the end ruined it even on that level.

The whole premise that a grumpy old man kidnapped three pregnant women from abortion clinics to force them to give birth is plausible. The whole story presents that premise with the videos from the families and the interaction of the three women and doctor. The reveal at the end that only the one girl and the doctor are real and that they are in hell totally invalidated everything that happened throughout the movie. The entire story of the film is shown to have been a deception; there's just no reason for such a development. They are in Hell -- there's no reason for them to be told otherwise. And the faked videos from the families really is a stupid turn. They are dead so their families wouldn't be sending any such messages -- there's no reason for it.

The twist at the end only made a story that was lack-luster at best, a complete waste of time.",1427846400,3,2482,4.604072398190045
8538020,1,B009999YDC,"This movie was made to carry some sort of pro-life message, but unfortunately the message falls flat and leaves an almost opposite effect of making the pro-life stance seem completely insane. I guess you can't expect much else from the premise of kidnapping abortion bound women, but I hoped that beneath it all would have been some sort of less crazy message and revelations. If you want to make a stance seem reasonable then a movie that is about extremists is not the way to go.

The acting is horrible. The trailer for this movie made it seem like it was filled with real actors and while I recognized one of them, the lines, writing and overall acting level would be better suited to an infomercial. I have heard better acting from politicians reading off of cue cards and repetitive health care videos in doctors office waiting rooms.

A chunk of the movie is the three girls watching interviews and debates on a television, not really the deeply touching or enlightening kind either.

****SPOILER****

There is a twist ending to the movie M. Night Shyamalan would approve of, and I do not mean that as a compliment.

Apparently two of the three girls in the movie did not really exist and the third girl had actually died on the abortion table and was being forced to be pregnant and give birth in Hell for all eternity along with the doctor who committed suicide over not being able to bear children.

So this movie, made with the intention of being somehow pro-life overall, has an end message that pregnancy and childbirth are a punishment from Hell. Good job.

Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, I absolutely do not suggest wasting your time or money on this movie.",1409270400,5,1681,4.658783783783784
8538021,1,B009999YDC,"Okay, this was made by some extreme pro-lifers who see every issue as simple and cut-and-dried. Spoilers ahead...

Spoilers ahead.

Spoilers coming.

Spoilers abound.

Well, now.  Three women are held captive by people who are going to force them to give birth and will try to convince them that any other way is wrong.  Eventually, we see that two of them are not real, while the third one and the OBGYN are in hell, and the third one is pregnant again right after giving birth to twins. Why? Because one died getting an abortion and the other committed suicide. So the message here is that they deserve to suffer forever, and hell is pregnancy and being pregnant and giving birth are pure hell. Um, yeah.
Hell is being stuck with unforgiving rightie-tighties forever.",1356048000,15,769,4.7443609022556394
