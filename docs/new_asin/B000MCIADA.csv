2728143,5,B000MCIADA,"Steve Murray has done it again!  Steve continually opens doors and lights the way for those desiring to enhance their life and those they seek to serve through Reiki and energy work.  This new DVD is an anticipated treasure in clarifying how to give an attunement including preparation and protection.  This is an excellent tool that assists the new Reiki master before giving an attunement and an excellent source for review and strengthening one's abilities and confidence in giving attunements.  This DVD complimented with Steve's other works brings together valuable tools in learning and understanding, and in both giving and receiving Reiki.  Thank you, Steve, for your courage in bringing vital Reiki information to mankind.  Thank you for your caring spirit.  Thank you for being a maverick!",1183334400,2,799,5.244094488188976
2728144,5,B000MCIADA,"My husband always had trouble hearing the other DVDs and had questions that were unanswered, but with this DVD everything he needed is shown and described onscreen. Now he really gets what to do for Healing and it has clarified what the books and other DVDs were telling him. This is a fantastic tool for teaching Reiki and for learning the fine points.
Steve has really gone a long way to clear up any confusion that may occur.
This is the best DVD yet.",1182124800,6,454,4.416666666666667
2728145,5,B000MCIADA,"This DVD is tremendous. It actually shows Reiki Master Steve Murray passing Reiki Attunements step by step complete with seeing the symbols going into the Chakras and placed in the Aura. Perfect for learning and/or seeing how Reiki Attunements are passed. There's other useful Reiki information on the DVD also. Steve's Reiki Ultimate Guide books are great, but it is very helpful to see him passing Attunements. So this DVD is a must to have with his books. His Books and this DVD make a great program for learning Reiki.

2728146,5,B000MCIADA,"This is a wonderful, thorough and inspiring introduction DVD to Reiki healing aimed at demonstrating to students and potential students how the Reiki process works. Because the symbols are projected clearly on the screen and the Reiki process is shown very precisley, the viewer has a very comprehensive idea of how to approach Reiki as a serious healing profession. Steve Murray is gentle, persuasive and not at all pushy or trying to sell "" a product."" His sole goal is to introduce the energy as honestly and completely as possible. In addition, for the beginner, there is a healing benefit to just watching the tape. It is clear that the DVD needs to be supplemented with the written books, but it is an excellent way to begin the process. The visuals and the music are relaxing and soothing as well.",1181433600,12,804,4.75

2728148,5,B000MCIADA,I am working on my master's in mental health counseling. I will be using methods like meditation and Reiki in my practice. In the past people marketed Transcendental Meditation (TM) to make large sums of money. The concept of meditation was good but using it to bilk large sums of money from others was just wrong. Reiki is at a crossroads. People must decide if it is to be used just as a money making scheme or for the betterment of mankind. The concept of Reiki works. It has helped many people. But like TM some see Reiki as a way to make large sums of money off others. Steve Murray has taken Reiki and made it available to everyone at a fair price. His books and tapes work. Bravo Steve!,1240531200,,693,4.297709923664122
2728149,5,B000MCIADA,"Great compliment to Steve Murray's Reiki attunement DVD's and books. Shows  step-by-step, how to perform several Reiki attunements, and makes the  process crystal clear. I commend Steve for making this knowledge available to so many people.",1238371200,,240,5.638888888888889
2728150,5,B000MCIADA,"I like Steve Murray's books and DVD's because they are written by a man who truly believes in Reiki and what Reiki can do for everyone. Steve's introduction is quite honest and I know of others who share this philosophy and dedication to making Reiki affordable to people.

What these books and DVD's can give you is a working knowledge of how to draw the symbols and the process of attunements both receiving and giving. The pictures are very easy to follow and detail hand positions and how and where to draw the symbols for passing on attunements.  As for the complaints for not having the traditional hand placements he clearly states the philosophy behind his reasons to give treatment to specific places of the body and why.  This made sense to me and as I know every practitioner is not the same.  Getting the traditional placements online is easy.

I also felt the attunement dvd's or video's Steve Murray has available are amazing. They are wonderful, life altering, and being absolutely blessed experience. Reiki is for everyone willing to learn and he provides it.  Thanks for not coloring inside the lines.

2728151,5,B000MCIADA,"I have nothing but great things to say about Steve Murray's program.  All his books are well-written, to the point, and very informative.  I also agree that if you can send someone long-distance Reiki, it only follows that you could send someone a long-distance attunement.  I was fortunate enough to be able to do both a Reiki 1 seminar in person, and Steve Murray's Reiki 1 DVD attunement with his books.  Both taught the same information about the history of Reiki, what Reiki is and isn't, and how attunements are given.  The only difference is that in the seminar we were shown how to give Reiki to self and others and had the opportunity to practice quite a few times.  I think that if Steve Murray could make a DVD with a demonstration of giving a full Reiki session to self and to others, that would make his program complete in my opinion.  However, you can purchase William Lee Rand's `The Reiki Touch' set and that comes with a DVD demonstration.  There is not an attunement in that set because they are of the belief that attunements must be done in person.  The in- person attunement and  Steve Murray's DVD attunement felt the same to me and I plan to do Reiki 2 and Master Reiki through Steve Murray.  He also can send you a really beautiful certificate for each level you complete!",1221091200,,1297,4.523605150214593
2728152,5,B000MCIADA,"This DVD is enjoyable to watch and easy to follow. With the reiki symbols appearing on the screen and moving to the needed location as per the attunement instruction, no guess work is necessary. It's just like being in a workshop but better because you can review the DVD as many times as needed.",1220400000,,296,4.5
2728153,5,B000MCIADA,"Empowering!!
I am by nature open minded but cautious. I read Steve's website top to bottom and was inspired by the truth as I read it. It resonated with something deep inside me. I was very drawn to his openness and perspectives on Reiki and decided that this was the right path to follow. I have not been disappointed at all!!  Very congruent in all his writing and his mission statement.
His DVD's and books empower you on whatever level you are interested in learning. He is a true teacher. You can read it, see it and feel the energy.
Thank you so much Steve for all your insightful information and for sharing all your knowledge with everyone in an affordable way. This was a smart investment for me. I am truly grateful and much more knowledgeable.",1219708800,,754,4.5036496350364965
2728154,5,B000MCIADA,"I was already a Reiki Master, and purchased Steve Murray's, Reiki Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol. 2, Vol. 3, and Vol. 4, along with the DVD attunements for each. The attunements were very powerful, and the energy flow is no doubt stronger. This program has to be the most convent, and realistic way to get started in the Reiki healing practice. I have tried several other Reiki programs in the past, and Steve Murrays Reiki Ultimate Guides, are the very best I have found yet. You will not be disappointed.

2728155,5,B000MCIADA,"I would love to detail all of the specifics of what I found interesting and helpful from the books and DVDs in this system, but that would surely take up more time and room than this space allows, lol. Suffice it to say that those Reiki recipients whom I have been working with for some time have commented that they notice an increase in Reiki power -- and they didn't know that I had been doing further study with Steve Murray's Usui Reiki system products; they simply knew something was different. As a newly-signed author myself, I love his writing style; Steve is straight to the point without unnecessary wording --- I like and appreciate that.
Steve Murray's books and DVDs and absolutely priceless and will remain in my personal library as invaluable reference materials in the years to come. I do and will recommend them to anyone that I believe would be interested. I also see that his new book and DVD will be released soon. I plan to purchase and study those also ;)

2728156,5,B000MCIADA,"After being attuned to the 3 Reiki DVD's, I tried it out on 1 of my massage clients. He was more than willing to be my Guniea pig. I asked him not to tell me if anything was wrong, I wanted to see if I could figure it out on my own. While i was performing the session, i felt tingling going all over my hands & going up my arms. I wasn't sure if it was the Reiki or if my hands were falling asleep from holding them up for so long. They tingled all over his body. When our breif session (maybe about 15 minutes) was over, I asked him if he was sore all over. He responded, ""Yes! How did you know?"" I told him, ""I just knew."" Still not sure if it was the Reiki, his wife, who is a dear friend, reinforced it for me. She said, ""He said he NEVER felt anything like it in his life. He never felt such heat generated from something that wasn't touching his body."" I believe this is proof that the Reiki Steve's teachings and attunements work.

His books are so helpful in answering questions that he didn't have time for on the DVD's. So far, my favorite is the ""False Beliefs"" book. I started out with that book. The others reiterate it & therefore, I believe make the Reiki stronger because you can understand it better. Steve is a wonderful teacher and is so helpful in answering your questions. There is no doubt in my mind that he is an even better teacher in person. If I had the money to visit him in California, I would. He is a very special person.

2728157,5,B000MCIADA,"This is a great way to learn Reiki. I took a lesson for one and two attunments. But I get more out of Steve Murray's information. I have all of his books, DVD's, CD's. I can go back at anytime to study the information. This way I learn it even better and grow with it. I can't go back to a class unless I pay BIG DOLLARS!!! This is well worth it, it teaches you the same thing a class does. When I did the first attunment I truly felt something, more than I did at a class. It give me more consentration being by myself so I get the real feeling. It's amazing. I now have my Master through this wonderful program.",1211155200,,613,3.991869918699187

2728159,5,B000MCIADA,"Steve Murray's DVD programs are great! This is a great demonstration DVD that takes the viewer through the how to's of performing Reiki Attunements. We found it tied the Ultimate Guides together in a very understandable format. Seeing how Steve worked in his Reiki sessions, as well as preparing the room and himself prior to and after each session were great learning opportunities and reinforcement.

This is a great resource to those that don't have access or money to go to a local Reiki Master for their information or Attunements. Feel the heat!",1206230400,,551,4.924731182795699
2728160,5,B000MCIADA,"Steve Murray's Reiki books are well worth purchasing, whether you are a beginner wishing to learn, or an intermediate student looking for reference material. His detailed instructions and lavish photo demonstrations of the various attunements and techniques are invaluable for those who don't want to memorize or can't remember something they've been taught in a weekend class.

The attunement DVDs are a wonderful low cost way to receive the attunements, especially for those who are not intending to go into Reiki as a business, but simply want to learn how to do Reiki for themselves, family and friends. My personal belief, based upon my own experience is that long distance attunements do work. I've been doing Reiki for myself and for those near and dear to me. I feel the success of the treatments is vouched for by the number of people who've been referred to me.

I appreciate Steve's attitude that the actual healing is the important thing, and that lineage and apprenticeship to a Reiki Master should take a back seat to that. Some people do need that sort of structure and instruction, and that's fine. Those so inclined should definitely pay the money and take a class to receive their attunements. Personally, I already had a background in Therapeutic Touch and Crystal healing, & I view Reiki as an enhancement of what I was already doing.

I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs valuable, & I'm pleased with his maverick view of a subject which should be allowed to grow and evolve, lest Reiki fall prey to too much ceremony and institutionalism.",1196208000,,1561,4.8830188679245285
2728161,5,B000MCIADA,"I had taken Reiki Level 1 and Level 2 from a Reiki Master in Sedona, AZ,  and felt that I wanted to further my Reiki education, but didn't know where to start.  I had questions about Reiki that my Reiki Master couldn't answer, and so, I didn't feel confident to go out into the world and practice Reiki in a professional setting.  I knew that clients would ask me questions that I, like my Reiki Master, wouldn't be able to answer.  So, I prayed for guidance and asked to be directed to someone who could help me.

Not long after my prayer, I found Steve Murray purely by accident.  I had gone into a bookstore in Sedona, AZ and on a shelf in front of me was his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD.  I was a little skeptical at first, since my Reiki Master had told me that attunements needed to be received in person, but something about his creative use of Reiki intrigued me, so I purchased the DVD, along with Steve's ""Reiki Healing Attunement"" DVD, and I still can't believe the results I received!

I received such powerful attunements from his DVD's!!  I had always been psychic with natural healing abilities, but his attunements seemed to amplify my skills even more!  I began having consistent clairvoyant visions after taking his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD, and I received almost instant healing of some stress related conditions, I had been dealing with for some time, shortly after taking his ""Reiki Healing Attunement"", from his DVD.  The results I received were nothing short of miraculous!  I definitely knew then that there was power in his DVD attunements!  And that attunements didn't have to be taken in person in order to be effective!

So, I purchased all the rest of his DVD's and Books and have never been disappointed!!  His Books are written so clearly and concisely that anyone, no matter what their educational background can understand them .  Steve is very generous with the wealth of information he provides in both his Books and his DVD's , and when I was finished (reading his books and taking his attunements) I truly felt I had finally attained a solid foundation from which to practice Reiki professionally.

I ended up finishing my Reiki Master with Steve Murray, and I truly feel it's the best decision that I have ever made!  All my questions about Reiki have finally been answered through his Books and DVD's and I feel so grateful to have found him!

If you are interested in Reiki education, there is no better person to work with than Steve Murray!  I have read many, many Reiki authors and there is no one that comes close!  I am convinced, that the results you'll receive, from Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's, will truly astound you!  As they have truly astounded me!  I don't care what anyone says, distance attunements really work!!!

My dream has been, for sometime now, to practice Reiki professionally, but I was afraid to, because I didn't feel I had all my questions answered. I didn't feel I had a solid foundation from which to work from, but now, because of Steve Murray's Books and DVD's, I feel that I finally have the knowledge and confidence necessary to succeed!  Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's have truly made my dream a reality!  And for that, I will be forever grateful to him!

Whether your goal is to work professionally with Reiki, or to use it to heal and enhance your everyday life, you can't go wrong with Steve Murray's Books and DVD's.  They are truly worth the investment!  I know I will be referring to them for reference, and reinforcement, for many years to come!  God bless Steve Murray!",1195344000,13,3575,4.646496815286624

2728165,5,B000MCIADA,"I would like to thank Steve Murray for providing these Reiki attunement programs.  I have received 1st and 2nd degree from his products and also from a live class.  The experiences were very different but both were wonderful. I have not been able to raise the $1,000 required for my Masters Attunement from the organization that I received my live 1st and 2nd from but Steve has made it very affordable to receive the attunement.  I have read some of the reviews and see that one or two have been upset because they didn't feel anything.  I don't know what they expected to feel but Steve does explain that if you can't feel anything it does not mean that you did not receive the attunement.  I have definitely been able to tell that I have received the Master Attunement even though I didn't ""feel"" that much while receiving the attunement.

I definitely recommend that anyone taking his attunements also read his Ultimate Guide Trilogy.  They are so packed with information about Reiki that I feel so much more prepared to be a Reiki healer than I did prior to reading them. They are truely wonderful and his A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra DVD is very helpful in showing you how to perform your own attunements.  Reiki False Beliefs Exposed is very good in answering questions you might have about things you have heard about Reiki and setting the record straight in many areas.  I also have had Steves Psychic attunement and the wonderful thing about his programs is that you can take them over and over again and that is something you can't do with a live attunement.  Of course, you need to follow Steve's cautions in waiting three days between pschic attunements.

I immediately began the long distace healings, using Steve Murray's method. Within a week, my friend's father was out of intensive care, and back at home. I continued the long distace healings on him, and he lived three more years. I have had the Reiki Master attunement, and am reading more of his books. I plan to have him certify me as a Reiki Master.

As we move into the 21st Century I believe it's crucial to spread this work as far and as wide and as QUICKLY as we can. It's a shame if this amazing healing technique has been kept from anyone because of the cost of classes.

8167824,5,B000MCIADA,"Since my first attunement many years ago, I have been looking for answers about reiki. Even after becoming a reiki master, the questions remained. Either due to secrecy, or they themselves just didn't know. Since I was a young boy I have always wanted to know more about becoming a healer. It seemed with every turn came a hefty price or a brick wall. How does one explain a healing procedure, when your not sure of the answers yourself. It was like having an owners manual with most of the pages missing. Needless to say my reiki practice was limited to animals and close associates. Hey...at least the animals didn't ask questions. lol. After hearing about Steve Murrays Ultimate guides and dvd's, I was skeptical. I did research and found all the wonderful things that was said about him and his reiki guides. My instincts kept telling me to go for it. To take a chance. So, in a bold endeavor for answers, I purchased all 5 volumes of Steve Murrays reiki guides. Plus, his book Reiki False Beliefs Exposed. His 1st, 2nd, and master reiki attunement dvds. Psychic and chakra attunement dvds. And his Animal Psychic Communications book. I'm here to tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made!! From the time I opened the first Ultimate guide. Answers came faster than I could have ever imagined. Through the straight forward and concise information in these materials, I have a renewed confidence. With the first book, I have learned more in one sitting than I had in several years of questioning. With his psychic and chakra attunements, I have actually seen profound results in a short amount of time. Steve Murrays Reiki False Beliefs Exposed was very in depth. Really cleared the air on the reality of reiki. As for his Animal Psychic Communications book. It has helped tremendously between myself and my horses, and pets.
