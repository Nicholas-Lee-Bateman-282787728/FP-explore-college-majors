6361291,2,B00JJC2OVS,Beware this is not a quality made movie.  It is more like a homemade movie with very poor special effects.  This is definitely not worth the money to rent or to own.  I am very surprised that Amazon would offer such a feature.  The only good part is that they did portray the biblical account of Jonah accurately.,1431129600,,313,4.344827586206897
8651271,1,B00JJC2OVS,"Biblically accurate and informative, but very amateurish production. Sounds like it was recorded in a small room, sound sometimes out of synch. Special effects look like they were created by a young child. Main character seems like he is making up the script as he goes. Maybe good for someone who does not know the story, but not for entertainment. etc., etc., etc.",1487376000,,366,4.825396825396825

8651276,5,B00JJC2OVS,"This is different and some may find the humor out of place, but in fact my curiosity kept me involved. Nothing here distracts from the story of Jonah's anger and disappointment with Jehovah for sparing the people of a city he considered beyond redemption. Jonah is not happy with Jehovah's decision. That points to how many times we as His spirit children, are never satisfied with His directions because we want to go our own way. Not just the wicked but the self righteous have to watch ourselves. The story is related well and emotionally. I also appreciated the producer's discussion of the embellishments he added to tell the tale and make sure he pointed out historically accurate information that a viewer could easily verify from the Bible and scientific data.  I will watch this again.",1454284800,,794,4.838235294117647

I liked this movie. I recommend it.
 It was very educational. I appreciated learning the timeline of events for Jonah's life.
Also, it was accurate. It  clarifies and follows the 2 paged story of Jonah very closely, with the added bit of info found elsewhere in the Bible. It is a sermon in entertainment form. Most every Bible movie has the people speaking with British accents, which is unrealistic. And most Bible movies are so over dramatic. This one has  humor laced throughout and doesn't take itself too serious. Parts were actually filmed in the City of Nineveh as rebuilt by Sadaam Hussein, I recognized that at the wall with the large King painted on it.... ISIS has prob'ly since destroyed it.  The ship captain was a really good portrayal, not stereo-typical.  The song in this movie  ""Take out the Trash"" was fitting.  That's how God works.
The creators of this film should be labeled  ""Genius.""  This is not a cookie-cutter/stereotype  Bible movie. It's a departure from the normal.
The people who are badmouthing it are most likely those with misplaced expectations -who don't like going to church, studying the Bible and praying and worshipping Jesus...This film wasn't made for them. It is a different type of movie on purpose, aimed at a Christian or Jewish audience--Those who are ""In The Know."" Earth has become on big giant Nineveh. Judgement is coming. Time to take out the trash.",1433376000,2,1501,4.82421875
8651279,1,B00JJC2OVS,This is not great all. A bad low budget movie. I couldn't get threw 10 minutes.,1432857600,,79,4.0
8651280,5,B00JJC2OVS,"Critics beware. Buyer be Blessed.
The critic of this movie is most likely a rival jealous film maker, seeking revenge. If you will check, you will see that at the time of his writing, he only had one review...this movie.
This is a movie made by a Christian and a Jew.  Their God Jehovah promises ""I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you.""  He always keeps his promises.
I enjoyed this movie. I purchased a DVD through Amazon. It is low budget, and never pretends to be anything else. It sets the facts straight. Even the well trained preachers never get it right. It showed alot of study went into this film. It was good acting and good special effects. It is a ""Picasso-esque""  different style of film making.  I enjoyed the music and the message of God's justice. Parts were even filmed in Iraq it was obvious.  It stirred my imagination. Jonah's sermon to the people of Nineveh was top notch.
  The Critic on the other hand was a dullard who lives in a tiny one room apartment and has no life except to criticize others via his laptop.",1432080000,,1062,4.415384615384616
