1399555,5,B000056T5K,What an excellent example of how children can be friends even if they have differences and how one child over came his fears to save the day.  An awesome story line and excellent acting on everyone's part.  It was a delightful film to watch and you will only want to rewind and watch it again and again.  It is a wonderful family film!,984096000,,335,4.285714285714286
1399556,5,B000056T5K,"The Little Vampire (loosely based on Angela Sommer-Bodenburg's excellent book series) is not only a fun family film (the title above refers to one of the more humorous lines in the movie when a vampire encounters a Game Boy Color for the first time), but is also sure to become a bit of a cult classic amongst the ""goth"" crowd.  With an interesting plot, memorable lines and characters and great costumes and scenery, this film is one that you are sure to enjoy watching time and again. Basic plot synopsis: Tony Thompson (Jonathan Lipnicki) is a misunderstood boy who has trouble fitting in once his family moves to Scotland.  After he meets Rudolph (a vampire played by Rollo Weeks), however, he learns the true meaning of the word friendship and the two share a grand adventure. If you missed your chance to see this film while it was in the theaters, rectify your mistake today by buying The Little Vampire on DVD or VHS.  You won't be disappointed! Special DVD note: this disc is full of extra's, including games, recipes and jokes for the little ones.  Although the inclusion of some deleted scenes would have been a nice touch, the disc is still more than worth the money.  Enjoy!",983923200,2,1187,4.660287081339713
1399557,4,B000056T5K,"This movie was excellently done.  It was well-acted, well-directed, and well-written and the music was fine.  It was a great thing to take children to, and any adult can enjoy it if they don't take themselves too seriously-which I think too many do.  I would have loved it and given it five stars instead of four if not for one thing-I have been reading and enjoying the books they were based on for years and this movie was nothing like it aside from the basis that a human kid has a young vampire friend named Rudolph.  I think the movie could have been improved if Tony had just been older.  The kid who actually played him was too young.  Anyway, the movie was entirely untrue to the story and the feel that Angela Somer-Bodenburg gave to the books was definitely lacking here.  For one, the vampires are now gentle caring wonderful beings.  Every character who wasn't completely out of character for the book was overly done.  Anna, who I thought sweet and charming in the book, is a driveling annoying little thing you just want to drown.  Rudolph's selfishness, cowardice, and double-standard views played well in the book against Tony's responsibility, loyalty, and indignance.  In fact, the only character who was even near being up to code was Gregory, the nasty older brother.  And the way all the vampires in the book seemed to take pride in being vampires was neat too.  Not so in the film.  All in all, I don't want anyone to think I totally hated the movie.  As I said, it was excellent-in itself.  But it's a real disappointment for anyone who read and enjoyed the real Little Vampire stories.",979344000,,1609,4.612676056338028

This movie has a little bit of everything comedy, action, etc. This movie definetley deserves a Five-Star rating! The actors also acted very well. Especially Johanthon Lipnicki, Richard E.

1399581,3,B000056T5K,"This is in the same vein as after school specials. Once a gain the individual puny brat knows more than his parents and peers. However it was well done and not fly by night. You can tell this is a vampire movie because Anna Popplewell as Anna Sackvill-Bagg is always vamping Jonathan Lipnicki.

The cows make the movie as they mostly hang around in the barn and at a static point deposit nitrogenous waste on the windscreen of the bad guy's vehicle; then they snicker at the prospects.

To distract those older nippers watching this film there is Alice Krige. You can feel the electricity as she controls them and mesmerizes the viewer.

Lots of action with unexpected ending.",1501891200,,676,4.663865546218488

1399642,5,B000056T5K,"Every Halloween, I always looked forward to when this movie would air on TV. And when it finally left the airwaves, I was happy to find it on DVD, as it's one of my Mom and I's favorite Halloween films. Eight year old Tony Thompson, and his mom and dad, have recently moved from America to Scotland due to his dad designing a golf course for a man named Lord McAshton. Tony has a hard time fitting in and making new friends, which isn't helped by his really vivid bad dreams he begins having about vampires. One night, the dreams turn real when a young vampire boy crashes into Tony's room, trying to hide from a bumbling vampire hunter, intent on killing him. But as it turns out, the vampire, named Rudolph, and his family don't really want to hurt humans, or be vampires at all. They're all members of the clan of Sackville-Bagg, who are trying to recover a lost medallion by the time of the full moon. If they can do this, then they can become fully human again. With Tony's help and friendship, can the ""monsters"" defeat the vampire hunter and regain their humanity again? I kinda makes no sense to buy it from amazon instant video for 7.99 when you can buy the dvd for 4.99..........I Love this movie i've watched it so many times when i was a kid and when i found out amazon had it i just about died I ordered it right away!",1480550400,,1331,4.306772908366534

1399922,4,B000056T5K,"Every Halloween, I always looked forward to when this movie would air on TV. And when it finally left the airwaves, I was happy to find it on DVD, as it's one of my Mom and I's favorite Halloween films.

Eight year old Tony Thompson, and his mom and dad, have recently moved from America to Scotland due to his dad designing a golf course for a man named Lord McAshton. Tony has a hard time fitting in and making new friends, which isn't helped by his really vivid bad dreams he begins having about vampires. One night, the dreams turn real when a young vampire boy crashes into Tony's room, trying to hide from a bumbling vampire hunter, intent on killing him. But as it turns out, the vampire, named Rudolph, and his family don't really want to hurt humans, or be vampires at all. They're all members of the clan of Sackville-Bagg, who are trying to recover a lost medallion by the time of the full moon. If they can do this, then they can become fully human again.  With Tony's help and friendship, can the ""monsters"" defeat the vampire hunter and regain their humanity again?

If it were possible, I'd actually rate this movie at 3 and 1/2 stars (but Amazon doesn't allow half stars). Admittedly, there's certain things that just haven't aged well since the time of it's release, like the outdated CGI and the 90s references (apparently, the Game Boy Color was the most advanced video game system at the time).  However, that doesn't really affect the plot itself at all, and the idea of vampires wanting to become human is a pretty unique one. Tony and Rudolph's budding friendship is both hilarious and adorable, and while the villain seems like he stepped out of one of the ""Home Alone"" movies, I can overlook this, considering this movie was made primarily for younger kids. One interesting thing to note too, is the fact that, while the vampires ARE friendly, they don't skirt around the fact that they still have to stay out of the sunlight and drink blood, and do other less-than-favorable things that are out of their control.  Being a vampire isn't considered particularly ""cool"" or a good thing, which makes their plight to become human all the more urgent.  And the final scene will put a big smile on your face.  :)

While the film's starting to show its age just a bit, this is still a great Halloween-ish movie that the whole family can enjoy. I'd reccommend this for ages 8 and up, due to some scary images and references in relation to vampirism (like stakes through the heart, biting people, blood, etc.)",1430092800,,2525,4.583148558758315

the family of Vampires and the American Family are involved in antics that elude Vampire Hunters.  Good humor for everyone.  The ending throws the viewer a real airborne curveball.",1421020800,,613,4.970588235294118

Tony moved to Scotland from California and is the new kid and somehow has not settled well in becoming welcomed at school. He suffers from nightmares about vampires and an amulet every night. After being laughed and bullied at school and not taken seriously by his parents, Tony's dreams come true. A vampire named Rudolph comes into his room one night weak from mal-nourishment in vampire terms. After Tony helps Rudolph, they become quick friends and Tony finds himself having to solve a 3 century mystery. Vampires want to become humans, but can't because the Amulet they need went missing into the ocean. Tony's journey to solve this mystery leads him exploring lost and hidden catacombs. If you aren't a fan of the Twilight Saga, don't turn away from this family friendly film that can be enjoyed by all ages.

1400233,5,B000056T5K,"Poor 7 year-old Tony Thompson. He's moved from America to Scotland with his Mom and Dad with his Dad's new job. He's being bullied by Nigel and Flint McCashton, and hasn't made any friends. Part of the problem is that he insists on insisting that vampires are real.

Take his teacher's class presentation: ""On Saturday night, we'll be able to see the comet [Attamon] in conjunction with the moon, for the first time in 300 years. And then...""
Tony interrupts, ""... and then a beam of light comes from the moon.""
Classmates giggle as the teacher says, ""As usual, our American friend is full of stories. What makes you say that?""
Tony: ""I dreamt it.... I've dreamt it every night since I've been here. And there's a gathering.""
Teacher: ""A gathering of what?""
Tony: ""A gathering of vampires.... I really saw it! The comet, the beam of light, the vampires and the vampire hunter.""
This earns Tony a seat in the hall, disgraced and further fodder for the bullies. As a matter of fact, that night Tony's parents attend a formal party at the McCashton castle. Nigel and Flint tell Tony's parents, ""Tony is our favorite plaything.""

While his parents are at McCashton's party, Tony is home with a baby sitter. He's dressed as a vampire, complete with paper fangs and ketchup blood. What he doesn't know is that down the road, a man named Rookery is warming up his truck. No ordinary truck, it has floodlights and shovels, winches and radar. On the side is the writing:
Vampkill Ltd.
International Vampyrex Timberens

Rookery spies a vampire bat and takes chase. The exhausted bat takes refuge in Tony's bedroom. He turns into his humanoid form of Rudolph, exhausted, and asks Tony, ""Do you know where I can get a cow?""

That night the friendship between the 7 year-old mortal and the eternally 9 year-old vampire is cemented. First, as Tony saves Rudolph by finding him a cow. And second, when Rudolph saves Tony from Rookery, who thinks Tony is a vampire also - well, Tony did still have his vampire cape on.

This great family movie was released in 2000. Like the best of family movies, it has humor for all ages. There are funny scenes, for example, with vampire cows and their puzzled farmer, and a hapless cemetery attendant. The vampire hunter is a hoot. And it turns out that there's a logical reason why Tony has had vampire nightmares since his first night in their house. (And what a house - I want a tower with a turret, too!)

An American couple bring their young son, Tony, to Scotland because the father is designing a new golf course, but the son has dreams of vampires, and feels compelled to seek them out. It becomes clear that he has an affinity for vampire kind and will have an important part to play in their destiny. On the way he will form a friendship with a vampire boy called Rudolph.

Much of the humour is slapstick, but still not totally overdone. There is also quite an interesting storyline, and special effects are good. It was quite an entertaining feature.

One point really did grate on me though, and that was the casting of Tony. No doubt he was chosen on cuteness, but he seemed to me to act an look several years younger than all of the other children - supposedly his age - in the story. He also tended to smile a great deal, which again was cute but sometimes just did not seem to fit the events that were happening in the story. This, to me, made the movie more appropriate for younger children and unlikely to appeal to older children and young adults. However it is a very enjoyable one for younger children and a great timewaster for all.",1341273600,,1221,4.4222222222222225

I can't stand the Twilight series and I haven't gotten into any of the new novels of that style that have followed the recent Teen vampire books craze. But this movie I actually enjoyed. Some of it is corny, but in a good way. You can tell whoever wrote the script didn't take it so seriously it missed it's ""kiddie"" mark, but at the same time wrote like they were writing for someone with an actual IQ. In other words, the lines are good, and even the 'stupid-funny' gags are reasonably enjoyable. Acting is good too. We have Anna Popplewell (Susan from Narnia) in this, as well as that dude that plays John Faa in Golden Compass/the mayor in Dinotopia; both of whom are very good at what they do. No second-rate acting there. Also, I noticed the vampire mother is the same actress who played the mayor's wife in Dinotopia, and I enjoyed her acting too.

The main reason I bought this movie, however, was to get a closer look than low-quailty youtube at some of the costumes. Whoever did the vampires' clothes for this movie was brillant. I loved those!

My one complaint is that, when I got my dvd in the mail, it was rattling round in the package and I, disappointedly, was afraid it might be scratched up and skip. And here I had been so excited to get my movie. Thankfully, I've watched it once on my blu-ray player and that doesn't seem to be the case. It appears to play fine in spite of it's not so good handling. Still, I would want Amazon/the postal service to pay more attention to something like that. Cuz it COULD have been broken.

1400319,3,B000056T5K,"The little vampire is about a third grader named Tony who has a tough time fitting in with the rest of the students because of his obsessions with vampires. He has been getting dreams about them and found them to be fun to draw and to imitate. The boys in his class like to pick on him and treat him like dirt because they find him to be weird. His parents don't believe him about the kids being bullies. The kids who are bullies are being played out as nice kids to their parents who are oblivious to the things they've stupidly said. Rudolph gets run in by a vampire slayer and needs to find a place to rest and to drink blood to restore his energy. He falls into Tony's chimney thinking that Tony is his brother or a fellow vampire. He discovers that Tony is a mortal and goes after him for his blood. Being too weak, he falls on the floor and Tony said he could help, if he wouldn't drink his blood. He agrees and took Rudolph to a farm to drink cow's blood. Ever since then, they became great friends and went to search for the amulet that Tony saw in his dream. The vampire slayer is behind their tales and with them all together, they manage to get it and Tony made the wish for all vampires to become mortal again.

The first thing I want to talk about the movie is first starting up the movie. The starting of the movie, there is a video clip of Tony and Rudolph playfully playing on a blimp. Soothing music is playing and soon Rudolph holds out his hand for Tony to hold on to while they take flight. I thought this is a great introduction to the DVD. It's comfortable to listen to and it makes you feel good watching it. Anyways, enough of that, the two boys fly outwards over Scotland and the DVD menus pop up. You get five selections to choose from. The selections from the DVD movie are: Scene Selections; Special Features; Play Movie and Audio Setup. The scene selection menu is to jump around in the movie quicker, so you can go back to that last scene you were in the middle of watching, but for some reason had to turn it off. Special features include games, the trailer, Cast and Crew, and Jokes and recipes. There are three games of which all suck. I didn't know what the heck I was doing when I was playing, but there are three games that are called: Graveyard golf, Find the amulet, and Mix and Match. For the Graveyard Golf game, you're supposed to pick a direction where you want the ball to go. There is no skill, just pick a random direction. There is like 5 rounds or something of this nonsense. Finding the amulet is the worse. It's like Graveyard Golf, where you have to pick a direction, but you have a ton of options and if you go the wrong way, a pop up on the whole screen says you went the wrong way, it gets very annoying. Once you find it, you'll feel like you just wasted your time. I felt that. Finally, the Mix and match game. Now, I thought this wasn't too bad. I found some amusement from cross dressing my characters, but I found it a little bit insulting to the movie. The second part to the Special Features is that you get to watch a trailer from the movie. Pretty cool, I guess. Cast and crew talks about each actor that played in this movie and what other movies they've been in. I was kind of hoping for a biography, but I guess this works too. The lamest thing about this is that they have all the actors' pictures who are a vampire upside down. The pictures weren't originally upside down. They just were goofing off because vampires usually hang upside down, BUT WHEN THEY SLEEP. It just looks stupid having it upside down. Finally, we have Jokes and Recipes, oh goodie. Some of the jokes are cheesy, but I thought a lot were entertaining. They've actually repeated some jokes in there and used the same answer for a couple of other jokes. For the recipes, they have caramel apples, fudgy bat cookies, jack-o-lantern pie, blue slime, and vampire's blood shake. Sounds great, right? I don't know. I never tried these before. Maybe I will when I get crazy on a Halloween night. The next part in the DVD menu is to play the movie. We get a selection from Full Screen to Widescreen. Well, it's 2011 and most of us have widescreen TVs, so of course we are going to choose the Widescreen format. But what is this? The widescreen format is just a stretched version of the full screen format? This can't be it showed screenshots of the differences between the two formats. Well, they lied to you. If you want to get the most out of this movie, choose full screen. They cropped out most parts of the frames in the movie, so you'll miss out on a lot of details. That's about it for the Playing Movie selection. What else is there? Enjoy! :) Now lastly there is Audio Setup. Here we get Dolby 5.1 surround sound in English or Dolby Surround Stereo in English. There is also an option to turn on subtitles, but of course it's only in English...nothing else? Great.

For this movie, I thought it was great when I was a kid. I bought it because I still liked it the same way when I was a kid. I also wanted a copy, so in case I do have kids down the road, I can show them this movie that I used to like. Kinda wished they had a blu-ray copy with the original theater version with better special features like interviews and the making of the movie, but what can ya do. Don't even remember, if this movie even came to theaters...

I don't really know why I like this movie. There are a lot of flaws in this movie along with the plot. It is mostly for kids who like vampires. I guess I like this movie because it keeps me entertained and I find it enjoyable. It's a cheap movie, so I got it.

Do I recommend this movie? Rent it on iTunes or somewhere else, first. Then decide to buy it. It got a 55% on Rotten Tomatoes and I feel that is a well deserve score.",1320278400,,5794,4.2407239819004525

1400321,4,B000056T5K,"I remember watching The Little Vampire many years ago with my younger siblings. It was such a charming little story about the enduring friendship between a mortal boy, Tony (played by the adorable bespectacled Jonathan Lipnicki of Stuart Little) and a forever 9-year-old vampire Rudolf.

When Tony's parents move him from California to the Scottish highlands, Tony finds himself not only miserable and unable to make any new friends, but also experiencing strange nightmares of vampires. So real are the dreams that Tony actually believes vampires truly do exist, and a chance encounter one night proves him right. Tony meets and befriends Rudolf, and helps his new friend get some nourishment by taking him to a nearby farm where there are plenty of cows.

Eventually Tony discovers that Rudolf has an entire family of vampires who have been forced to literally live underground because of a vampire hunter who is bent on seeing them destroyed. Their only hope of salvation is a mysterious jeweled amulet which can give them back what they've always wanted - a chance at a normal life.

The effects are certainly cheesy by today's standards, but they are funny to watch. My first grader delighted in watching the antics of Tony and Rudolf, the 'vampire' cows with their blood-red eyes, the way the cows hung upside down in their barn, and the bumbling vampire hunter.

Though I'd characterize this as a kid-friendly movie, the recommended age is probably 8 and up (though my first grader was fine with it), as there are some eerie scenes when the vampires bare their fangs which might unnerve younger children. Other than that, there really isn't any violence or overly scary scenes to frighten little ones. The message of friendship across barriers is well-conveyed and the ending will warm the hearts of viewers.",1319328000,,1815,4.98019801980198

You'll be able to tell it's a movie that had a lower budget to work with, but overall - it's a great movie for kids. Nothing at all that's too scary for younger children.

Tony Thompson (Jonathan Lipnicki -of Jerry Maguire fame)moves from San Diego to Scotland with his Dad, Bob (Tommy Hinkley) and Mom ,Dottie (Pamela Gidley).His Dad is in charge of building s new golf resort in the Highlands .

Tony is troubled by vivid dreams of vampires coming to get him and it transpires there are vampires in the area one of whom , a""boy""of roughly his own human age Rudolph (Rollo Weeks)he befriends .His family -headed by Richard E Grant and Alice Krige -are being hunted by Rookery ,a vampire slayer (Jim Carter)complete with neon crucifix and sun lamps on his truck. They are anxious to resume a normal human life and to do this must secure a special stone by sunset of the following day or else be doomed to remain vampires. Tony offers to help ,a promise that involves vampire tombs ,vampire cows(I kid you not)and coping with the local school bullies

The movie is well acted and is blessed in its child actors who are natural aand uncloying .Grant and Krige give it just the right amount of camp and Grant in particular would make a great vampire in a ""straight ""vampire picture having as he does the looks and gravitas for the role

There are some subtle movie references for adults and kids under ,say ,12 would enjoy the movie more than their older siblings who may find it a tad juvenile .In my view it is well written ,witty and shows a nice balance of horror played tongue in cheek and pure comedic moments",1199232000,,1629,4.571917808219178

1400378,5,B000056T5K,"I happened to catch this film on cable television and, as I have always enjoyed vampire tales, thought that I would give it a go, although my expectations were not high. Was I ever surprised! Boasting a superior cast, a genuinely interesting plot with some quite funny moments, I was riveted to the screen for the duration of the film.

The plot is simple. The Thompsons, an American family of three, are newly transplanted from California to Scotland for business reasons. Bob Thompson (Tommy Hinkley) is designing a golf course for one of the local gentry, Lord McAshton (John Wood). Bob's wife, Dottie (Pamela Gidley), is a stay at home mom to their adorable eight year old son, Tony (Jonathan Lipnicki). It seems that ever since they moved to Scotland and began living in their new home, a spooky old castle, Tony has been having nightmares, and has become obsessed with vampires, who seem to occupy his sleeping, as well as waking, hours. Moreover, Tony is having a hard time adjusting to his new school, as Lord McAshton's sons bully him unmercifully. Tony is not a happy camper.

One night, in flight from a local vampire hunter named Rookery (Jim Carter), an eternally nine year old vampire named Rudolph (Rollo Weeks) strays into Tony's bedroom. Suddenly, an unlikely friendship blossoms, and Tony's life begins changing for the better. Rudolph and Tony are very much in sync and attuned to each other's needs. While Tony envies Rudolph's ability to fly, Rudolph wishes that he could see blue sky and morning birds instead of being destined to roam the earth only by night.

Entwined in the plot is a mysterious missing amulet that the vampires are seeking, as it has the ability to grant them their dearest wish. Moreover, just as Tony has parents, so does Rudolph. His mother, the ravishing Freda Sackville-Bagg (Alice Krige) and his father, the imposing Frederick Sackvile-Bagg (Richard E. Grant), are initially distrusting of their son's friendship with a human. Rudolph's punky looking older brother would just as soon make a meal of Tony, while Rudolph's younger sister, Anna (Anna Popplewell), becomes smitten with him. Still, the friendship continues to flower, and Tony soon finds himself unceremoniously caught up in the path of the local vampire hunter, along with his new found friends. Meanwhile, Tony's parents have no idea that there is a colony of vampires in their midst.

Tony, however, appears to have the capability to help unlock the key to the vampires' current state of affairs through his ability to envision the past. In their efforts to put right what went wrong, Tony and Rudolph search for the amulet that contains the magical Stone of Attamon and have a number of adventures, most of which are funny and will bring a burble of laughter to the viewer's lips. In the end, Tony is called upon to make a decision that can change the lives of Rudolph and his family, forever.

The film, which is based upon a popular series of children's books by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg, boasts a well-written screenplay, as well as deft direction. The cast is first rate, and the roles are all well-acted. The adorable Jonathan Lipnicki is irresistible in the role of Tony. Who could not love this kid? Young girls, however, will have their hearts go aflutter over Rollo Weeks.

Adults and children alike will enjoy this delightful film. Adults will especially enjoy some of the parodies contained within the film. Look for Rookery's parody of Jack Nicholson's role in ""The Shining"", as well as Anna's parody of the Lauren Bacall role in ""To Have and Have Not"".

1400381,2,B000056T5K,"Vampires are the violent, scary, oversexed denizens of the horror tradition. So what a surprise to find them flapping bat wings in a children's film.

Of course, the monsters in The Little Vampire are considerably toned down from the frightening undead of the Dracula myth. Now they're just the thing to entertain grade-school trick-or-treaters, though they're probably too scary for preschoolers and too tame for teens.

For openers, these vampires no longer suck human blood: They restrict their nocturnal feedings to cows.

With Mom and Dad vampire caring diligently for their three fang-sporting children, they also express family values more than most of today's Hollywood human families.

And when they befriend a young human (the easily lovable Jonathan Lipnicki), they treat him decently -- even taking him for moonlit flights.

Lipnicki (the bespectacled youngster from Jerry Maguire) plays Tony, a 9-year-old recently arrived in Scotland with his parents.

But Tony has found himself in the midst of a 300-year vampire legend -- an 18th-century aristocratic family from the region now roams the moors, while a mean-spirited vampire-killer pursues.

Tony befriends a boy (played by Rollo Weeks) who seems his age -- though he's actually been 9 for 300 years. The two help the vampire family battle the villainous vamp-killer, find a magic amulet and attempt to restore the vampires to humanity.

Enough of the plot makes sense to at least allow young viewers to enjoy these characters -- especially the adventurous Tony. The story reflects the overactive imagination of an out-of-sorts, recently uprooted boy.

The Little Vampire offers limited enjoyment, at best, for teen and adult viewers, but for its target crowd -- say, 7 to 11 -- it has some entertaining bite.",1140825600,,1776,5.247349823321555

1400404,5,B000056T5K,"I happened to catch this film on a cable television channel recently and, as I have always enjoyed vampire tales, thought that I would give it a go, although my expectations were not high. Was I ever surprised! Boasting a superior cast, a genuinely interesting plot with some quite funny moments, I was riveted to the screen for the duration of the film.

The plot is simple. The Thompsons, an American family of three, are newly transplanted from California  to Scotland for business reasons. Bob Thompson  (Tommy Hinkley)  is designing a golf course for one of the local gentry, Lord McAshton  (John Wood). Bob's wife,  Dottie (Pamela Gidley), is a stay at home mom to their adorable eight year old son, Tony (Jonathan Lipnicki). It seems that ever since they moved to Scotland and began living in their new home, a spooky old castle, Tony has been having nightmares, and has become obsessed with vampires, who seem to occupy his sleeping, as well as waking, hours. Moreover, Tony is having a hard time adjusting to his new school,  as Lord McAshton's sons bully him unmercifully. Tony is not a happy camper.

One night, in flight from a local vampire hunter named Rookery (Jim Carter), an eternally nine year old vampire named Rudolph (Rollo Weeks) strays into Tony's bedroom. Suddenly, an unlikely friendship blossoms, and Tony's life begins changing for the better. Rudolph and Tony are very much in sync and attuned to each other's needs. While Tony envies Rudolph's ability to fly, Rudolph wishes that he could see blue sky and  morning birds instead of  being destined to roam the earth only by night.

Entwined in the plot is a mysterious missing amulet that the vampires are seeking, as it has the ability to grant them their dearest wish. Moreover, just as Tony has parents, so does Rudolph. His mother, the ravishing Freda Sackville-Bagg (Alice Krige) and his father, the imposing Frederick Sackvile-Bagg (Richard E. Grant), are initially distrusting of their son's friendship with a human. Rudolph's punky looking older brother would just as soon make a meal of Tony, while Rudolph's younger sister, Anna (Anna Popplewell), becomes smitten with him.  Still, the friendship continues to flower, and Tony soon finds himself unceremoniously caught up in the path of the local vampire hunter, along with his new found friends. Meanwhile, Tony's parents have no idea that there is a colony of vampires in their midst.

Tony, however, appears to have the capability to help unlock the key to the vampires'  current state of affairs through his ability to envision the past.  In their efforts to put right what went wrong, Tony and Rudolph search for the amulet that contains the magical Stone of Attamon and have a number of adventures, most of which are funny and will bring a burble of laughter to the viewer's lips. In the end, Tony is called upon to make a decision that can change the lives of Rudolph and his family, forever.

The film, which  is based upon a popular series of children's books by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg, boasts a well-written screenplay, as well as deft direction. The cast is first rate, and the roles are all well-acted. The adorable Jonathan Lipnicki is irresistible in the role of Tony. Who could not love this kid? Young girls, however, will have their hearts go aflutter over  Rollo Weeks.

Adults and children alike will enjoy this delightful film. Adults will especially enjoy some of the parodies contained within the film.

1400406,4,B000056T5K,"Witty, well-acted kids flick that parents will enjoy as well.

A very winning cast, great location, superb kids' story to work with, good production make for some campy scariness for kids with entertainment for mom and dad as well. Charming little movie that appeals to the kid in all of us. The predicament of the cows really did make me laugh out loud.

The acting by one and all was excellent, especially Richard E. Grant as the head of the vampire family. He brought a non-threatening, yet nerve wracking (well, for kids, anyway) presence to the movie. His charming powers over Mrs. Thompson were hysterical, and the entire cast did very well with this movie.

One for the kids that mom and dad will enjoy sitting through, which is a rarity anymore, except for the likes of Shrek.

Oh, and I can't omit Rollo Weeks, as The Little Vampire himself. He was so charming, so perfectly nailed the role of Rudolph. As well as the role for arguably the cutest kid in movies, Jonathan Lipnicki, as Tony Thompson. The crush Anna had on him was acted out adorably by Anna Popplewell, as well. There was just great acting all around in The Little Vampire.

A job well done by all involved. Entertaining, campy, scary enough for the little ones without freaking them out even slightly, and still entertaining for the adults.",1093564800,25,1315,4.675324675324675
1400407,1,B000056T5K,"I took my little nine year old brother to see this dud. What a terrible movie.
I was expecting a light hearted children's film and instead what I got was a mean-spirited adventure in Christian bashing with scenes that have no place whatsoever in a film aimed at a young audience.
The producer's bigotry against Christians is evident right from the start in its depiction of the so-called ""vampire hunter"".
He is easily the most disturbing character in the film. For starters his oversized crucifix looks like it was produced at a Las Vegas neon sign factory and his vehicle is a nightmarish cross between a mac truck and a steel mill. If this was meant to be funny, believe me, it wasn't.
The worst scene that I saw is when the boy at the center of the film gets trapped in a crypt and a rather large black rat begins crawling towards him.
I am flabbergasted that someone would think of this as legitimate children's entertainment. Graves and rats! Are you kidding me?! Absolutely despicable.
Throw in more nightmarish images of flying cows and children being given dead mice as gifts and you've got yourself one horrendously bad/disturbing movie that doesn't belong anywhere near impressionable youngsters.
I took my little brother and walked out of the theater rather than subject to him to any more of this garbage.
Shame on the people who made this.",1072224000,6,1353,4.737288135593221
1400408,5,B000056T5K,"Although this movie will definitely appeal to children because the hero is only eight years old and has some great adventures, it has enough wit to keep older kids and adults entertained as well.
The Thompson family (mom, dad and son, Tony) is living in Scotland while dad designs a golf course for Lord McAshton.  Tony is having a hard time fitting in and making new friends and begins having really vivid bad dreams about vampires.  Then one night, the dreams turn to reality when a small vampire invades Tony's room, trying to hide from a Vampire hunter, intent on ridding the countryside of all it's 'undead' inhabitants.
Fortunately, these 'undead' are not really interested in munching on the human population all that much.  They are all members of the clan of Sackville-Bagg who have found that there is a way in which they can become human, if they can only locate and recover a lost medallion by the time of the full moon.
With lots of help from Tony, they try to stay one step ahead of the Vampire hunter and complete the quest for freedom from vampirism.
Without doubt, Jonathan Lipnicki is one of the most charming and natural actors around.  I have loved every role of his that I have seen and ""Tony"" is no exception. Whether he is 'vamping it up' with fake vampire fangs and a cape or joyfully flying through the air with his new friend Rudolph, he is a treat to watch.
The younger actors, Rollo Weeks, Anna Popplewell and Dean Cook as a rebellous teenager are also excellent and likable as the vampire kids.  Other favorite characters are Richard E Grant and Alice Krige as loving parents to their little brood of vampirettes and the scene when they meet Tony's parents and charm them into a trip to the bluff is hilarious.
This is a really good, wholesome family movie that will entertain all the members of the family from the youngsters all the way up to Grandma.  It's not saccharin sweet and has a little bit of an edge but is gentle enough that it won't give even the little kids nightmares.
I've viewed this movie several times and still enjoy it every time!  This one is a 'keeper' and earns five stars from me.",1051401600,14,2135,4.544270833333333

This movie is a lot of fun, complete with flying vampire cows.  If you like light vampire comedy this one should make you smile.",1028073600,2,454,4.244186046511628
1400421,3,B000056T5K,"As its title and contents suggest, ""The Little Vampire"" is a film made mainly for kids in mind, and you cannot disguise that fact in any way.  But the film works pretty well as such, and though adults may feel sleepy sitting beside kids, children would enjoy watching the hectic adventure of Tony, played by sweet brother of ""Stuart Little,"" Jonathan Lipnicki.  And in this country, instead of pigs, cows can fly, too.  Funny rather than scary, isn't it? (but I feel otherwise should I see that).
The film is set in Scotland where newly-moved Tony meets Little Vampire Rudolph.  They soon establish unlikely friendship, and join in great adventure with his vampire sister, to seek for a red stone that can turn them and their clan to humans.
The story is simple as that.  But the charm of the film lies not there; for you can enjoy the good cast, especially Lipnicki and newcomer Rollo Weeks, playing together as two darling kids.  Apparently, the risky factors of the original stories by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg are subdued for younger children.  But that is the point, and certainly that makes the film less scarier for them to watch.
Frankly I thought the film's script may look too basic for adults, but it was a long, long time ago when I was a kid, and I must admit that I might have felt differently watching this film back then.  So, no more complaint.
It is interesting to notice, however, that some of the gags are meant for adult audience (but not many), and one of them is a parody of famous scene of ""Shining.""  It was not particularly a good one though, but what I was thrilled to see was Rudolph's aristocratic parents played flamboyantly by Richard E. Grant and Alice Krige.  As you know, Grant was in Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" while Krige was ""Borg Queen"" in the ""Star Trek: First Contact,"" and the latter's hairstyle here ineveitably led my mind to that film.  These facts justly make an impressive entry of this film into a cult classic.",1020211200,7,1964,4.6473988439306355

I noticed that there were 2 outstanding actors which were Rollo Weeks and Richard E. Grant. They couldn't have suited to parts more! I saw Jonathon Lipnicki as the main character but Rollo Weeks was still standing out from the crowd.
Jonathon Lipnicki could have acted older though.
In the books he was older but I think that everyone else suited there parts great.

1400424,4,B000056T5K,"""The Little Vampire,"" directed by Uli Edel, is an appealing fantasy/comedy for a family audience. The story involves Tony Thompson (played by Jonathan Lipnicki), an American boy whose family has relocated to Great Britain. There Tony befriends Rudolph (Rollo Weeks) a vampire boy whose family is being ruthlessly pursued by a vampire hunter who aims to destroy them.
This film portrays vampires as a persecuted minority who really mean no harm to humans (they'll drink cow blood if they need to). The film contains some fun sight gags (many involving vampire cows) and one-liners. There are also some genuinely magical sequences (most notably, some flying scenes).
Lipnicki carries his lead role well. And the wonderful Alice Krige (who also played the Borg Queen in ""Star Trek: First Contact"") is a delight as Rudolph's sexy vampire mom. But the standout performance is delivered by young Rollo Weeks as the vampire boy. Weeks brings both an ethereal charisma and a childlike ebullience to his character. The vampire performances are enhanced by good makeup and costuming.
There are a few slightly scary scenes, but nothing that bothered my 5-year old nephew too much. The accent in this film is on humor, fantasy, family, and friendship. I noticed some holes in the film's explanation of vampirism. But if you don't get too critical about the details, you should find ""The Little Vampire"" to be a delight for all ages.",993513600,17,1420,5.046808510638298
