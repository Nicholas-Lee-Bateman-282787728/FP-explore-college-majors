7913596,5,B00000JWWX,"My Aikido instructor was a student of Yamada sensei who of course studied with M. Ueshiba. Mr. Waite is Yamada sensei's personal ueshi deshi, and I have had the pleasure of seeing the great shihan launch a stout, and strong  Donovan Waite from one end of the room to another like a rag doll. Mr.  Waite has incredible ukemi, and on tape one he goes into detail as to how  he's developed it. Surprisingly, he came up with this method to off set the  many injuries he's received over the years. The instruction is clear and  easy to understand. All falls are taught at the ""safest"" level,  slowly going onto more difficult exercises as your ukemi developes. I was  astonished at how effective his techniques are. Both Mr. Waite and his  assistants are falling on synthetic tatami over concrete. Yet as they fall  they never seem to crash onto the mat. A good tape to have as you start to  look at improving your own ukemi.",964915200,23,920,4.4879518072289155

7913598,4,B00000JWWX,"Very well thoughtout and very sincere instruction.  Once fantastic point is that Sensei Donavan repeats each falling technique in different angles.  It was remarkable for him to take each fall slowly onto the mat without  sustaining any pain or injury.  I highly recommend this tape for all Aikido  practioners whether you are from Yoshinkan, Aikikai and the likes.",944784000,19,365,5.224137931034483
