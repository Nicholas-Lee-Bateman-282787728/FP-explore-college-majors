It also does not include too much emphasis on the product placement either. What it does include is a great amount of video in which people are enjoying hunting in a positive way. All in all, it feels better than later tapes. I would suggest it to anyone who wants to watch a hunting video.",1505433600,,458,4.464285714285714
8429793,5,B004I13AGI,"I've had Volume 1 on VHS for years, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to also have it on DVD as well, like if I'm taking a vacation, I could watch this on my DVD player. I always enjoyed Realtree's Monster Bucks videos forever and it's a wonder why it's one of the most popular deer hunting videos.",1483920000,,295,4.103448275862069
