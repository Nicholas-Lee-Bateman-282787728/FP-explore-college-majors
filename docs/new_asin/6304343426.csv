848758,5,6304343426,"Whoever the actor that played Basquait is, he did an incredilble job.  I didn't even know that was David Bowie as Andy Warhol!  What a trip!  This film is excellent in all aspects of filmmaking.  It captures the tortured  soul of a diluted artist, a timeless tale told again and again.  In this  film it is executed beautifully, totally connecting you to Basquait and  exposing the world in which he lives.",934070400,2,406,4.619718309859155

Drugs don't work. Aconfusion of manic creativity  and desperate lost souls with a sprinkling of light hearted loyalty go to  make what I feel is a very accesible yet thought provoking mastrerpiece-A  classic cult film this will become Iam certain!",915667200,,859,5.596899224806202

848761,5,6304343426,"The film takes an indepth look into one of the most interesting and controversial artists of the 1980's, Jean-Michel Basquiat. The film made by fellow artist Julian Schnabel, takes a look into Basquiat's rise into the  art world, his horrible drug addiction, his close relationship with Andy  Warhol, and his tragic death. Jeffery Wright provides a moving performence  as Basquiat. Dennis Hopper who plays real life gallery owner Bruno  Bischofberger, and Parker Posey who plays the role of Mary Boone show us  all how minipulating the art world can be. In all this film is one of the  greatest of its kind and I tip my hat to the creators.",911260800,2,640,4.7727272727272725
848858,4,6304343426,"This biopic of influential American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, expertly portrayed by the great Jeffrey Wright, covers the period shortly before he became a household name in the art world to his tragic early demise.  Filmed in a sort of fractured, collage-like style similar to the artist's work, it is rife with big-name stars portraying Basquiat's acquaintances, most notably David Bowie (R.I.P.) as Andy Warhol and Gary Oldman as a character based on Julian Schnabel, the movie's director. This is Schnabel's first movie and it shows because some of the editing and artistic touches are rough around the edges.  Even so, it is still a very effective portrait of the artist as well as the double-edged sword that is fame and fortune.",1505692800,,737,5.082644628099174

Evokes the downtown New York art world of the 1970s and '80s that flourished, nurtured great talent, and then crumbled in tragedy. A true artist's tribute to another, tragically departed true artist.

A bit sad in some ways, with the soundtrack and that Basquiat does heroine. Overall, I think it is well worth watching.

Writer, director, and cast obviously did their work and research for this film prior to shooting. It has quickly become on of my favorite. Entire team and production design even managed to capture a tone that is very Basquiat.
The freedom of expression with which Basquiat lived and worked is a part of why I am and always will be a fan. So glad this was captured well in this film.",1451865600,2,490,4.455555555555556

So, why was it so boring?!  Other reviewers who knew the real story about Basquiat and Julian Shnabel, the writer-director, probably can give good reasons.  For me, having to fast-forward through the last third, I only shook my head with disappointment.

David Bowie, portraying Andy Warhol, gives some comic relief at times, although it's a shamefully bad portrayal.  I won't waste any more time detailing how this film fails....just warning any potential viewers not to expect much, in terms of entertainment or actual information about the life of this artist.",1435795200,,814,5.271317829457364

849234,5,6304343426,"Basquiat is a major talent (according to myself). I have not read any biographies of him, so all I have to write this review is the movie and
my view of his art.

Basquiat is portrayed as coming from a troubled upper middle-class home, so terrible that he camps out in the park rather than live at home.

As Basquiat gains prestige and status, we see him hitting a glass ceiling of racism and social-acceptance. Basquiat self-medicates with
drugs until his passing. And this is how Julian Schnabel portrays him.

A solid buy.

With an all star cast, Basquiat is sure to win those willing to let themselves get taken in by the story over. It's a sad story but it's told with such passion and respect for the tortured artist that it somehow burrows itself into your mind and doesn't quite leave. Jeffrey Wright is wonderful in the lead and with a cast anchored by the likes of David Bowie, Dennis Hopper, Claire Forlani, Courtney Love, Benicio del Toro, Gary Oldman, Parker Posey and plenty of others from the 90's indie film scene, you're likely bound to fall in love with the film as I have.

849461,5,6304343426,"The film Basquiat shows a great deal of Art and Exile and most importantly it shows when art goes wrong. The movie ended with people surfing which shows the unstable ups and downs of the water relating to the ups and downs of his career that was very short lived due to him doing drugs. The part of his career that was art was creating life through pictures that causes audience members to fall in love with the character. However, this character was flawed and his imperfections led him to drugs and behaviors that led him to die. Jeffrey Wright played Jean Basquiat and he was able to illustrate a funny and yet dark side of the glamorous industry as he described being the only black  painter as using more than just black in his paintings, when he was avoiding a racial question. He wanted people to see more than his skin color, and to just treat him as another painter. The exile in his part is that he already does not fit into the community of the glamorous society therefore, in order to fit in the film director Julian Schnabel made this character experience with drugs. In the 90's, when this film was created, African Americans had to make great strives to become known in a country where being different is looked down upon. The film debuted in 1996 and it showed the world of art behind the scenes and how these celebrities are more than just famous people, and by having the main character be as flawed as Basquiat then the audience can relate to the film more. All in all, the film with very low lighting to show the darkness of the art world, and through a story line that is easily believable the film rates a 5.0/5.0 because of it's ability to be highly entertaining while audiences go away with a lot to learn.",1397779200,,1730,4.440251572327044

849594,5,6304343426,"Basquiat is a thought provoking film and a very impressive debut by painter-turned-director Julian Schnabel. Schnabel is quite the Renaissance man; he even collaborated with some of the composers for songs on the soundtrack. When the estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat refused to allow the use of his paintings, Schnabel painted the reproductions himself. Since Schnabel was a contemporary of Basquiat, also represented by Mary Boone's gallery, there is a character, Albert Milo that is a composite of Schnabel and other painters. Gary Oldham plays Milo, and as one might expect, he comes off a little better than most of the other sycophants who contributed to Basquiat's downfall. In spite of all his accomplishments, though, I think of Julian Schnabel as the guy a drunken Sean Young heckled when he won an award from the Director's Guild.

At first I didn't care for this film so much, but after a second viewing, it really won me over. What put me off was that Basquiat (Jeffrey Wright) seemed like an annoying poseur and I had trouble accepting him as an important artist. From one of the earliest scenes, where he goes to a cafe and gets kicked out for pouring syrup on the table and drawing in it, I was not on his side. Also, he was a graffiti artist, and I am not a fan of vandalism. As Basquiat grew more and more famous, he grew more and more insufferable. Finally, though, on the second viewing, I saw the film as more of a fable, and I didn't feel that Schnabel had any particular axe to grind, except to say that Basquiat had some talent but he paid a high price for his fifteen minutes of fame.

The phrase ""fifteen minutes of fame"" has really taken on a life of its own, and here I feel that it is pertinent to say that Andy Warhol coined this phrase, actually, ""In the future, everyone will be World Famous for fifteen minutes."" It was on the program notes for one of his art openings. You could see why it would catch on, and now with the tabloids of celebrity gossip, with reality television, Social Networks, and videos that go viral on the Internet, it seems prophetic. Perhaps this contribution to the popular cultural jargon, an expression of its zeitgeist, even overshadows his Art? Or is an extension of his Art, a further reproduction of Campbell Soup cans or Marilyn Monroe in various colors? I don't think the phrase was ever referred to in this film, but Warhol was a constant presence, as Basquiat's mentor and benefactor.

So, taken as a fable--with Basquiat, the man, symbolizing the Artist, wearing the crown briefly, until his fifteen minutes were up and he was discarded--Basquiat, the film, worked for me.

Though there was a strong fable at its core, two other themes emerged: Art in general, and how it is promoted by the gallery system, with fame, Art Critics, and Art Collectors defining and/or distorting its value, and the other theme was dilettantism. Dilettantism? What is that? For me this theme emerged, almost as a side effect due to the fact that a lot of the Artists involved didn't confine themselves to one medium. Schnabel, as I've noted before, was quite the Renaissance man, or you could also say he was quite the dilettante. He is a painter, but he also directs films, and even had a hand in the music. David Bowie is a musician, but he also paints and acts. David Bowie has stated in interviews that he would be bored doing only music. In this film Bowie played Warhol, who also involved himself with music and film. Another actor in the film, Dennis Hopper, was also a photographer. Basquiat is also doing videos and music in addition to painting, though in one scene he is asked if he is Tony Bennet, i.e., a singer who paints in his spare time. Even though Rene Ricard, the Art Critic who first recognized the talent of Basquiat, sneers at dabbling like Tony Bennet, the evidence of the film and the film makers' actual practices would argue otherwise.

Rene Ricard: When I speak nobody believes me, but when I write it down everybody knows it to be true.

Now, back to the subject of Art in general, in the credits it acknowledges that a lot of the film was based on an article written by Rene Ricard called The Radiant Child. Google it and you will find that Ricard has it posted on his blog on Myspace. It is well worth reading in conjunction with the film. Near the beginning of the film Michael Wincott, as Rene Ricard, reads the beginning of his seminal essay in voice over narration:

""Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh Boat. There is no trip so horrible that someone won't take it. Nobody wants to miss the Van Gogh Boat. The idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one. We must credit the life of Vincent van Gogh for really sending that myth into orbit. How many pictures did he sell? One. He couldn't give them away. Almost no one could bear his work, even among the most modern of his colleagues.""

The essay goes on to give a brilliant analysis and survey of current Artists such as Basquiat and their place in the scheme of things. At one point Ricard says ""When you first see a new picture you are very careful because you may be staring at van Gogh's ear.""

You might think that the film, Basquiat, treats Rene Ricard harshly, as he is seen as being desperate to cling to Basquiat as his career takes off and leaves him behind, but if you read the essay you will see that the whole film honors and acknowledges his words. It is a total validation of his essay. Michael Wincott's performance as Rene Ricard was really a scene-stealer. With his gruff voice and intensity he reminded me a lot of Eric Roberts, Julia's ne'er do well brother. This is a compliment, in case you didn't notice. The fact that Rene came off as a drama queen was no doubt because he was a drama queen. If the Gucci 'alyona' high heel platform over-the-knee boot fits, lace it up.

[Basquiat is nailing one of his pieces to the wall]
Rene: Child, you got no respect at all... nobody taught you how to mount paintings? You know me, when it comes to a mounting, the rougher the better.

David Bowie was also excellent as Andy Warhol. In spite of his celebrity as Ziggy Stardust, Rock Star, he melted into the role of Andy, an Artist that he had met and admired. Bowie has even written a song called ""Andy Warhol."" One of the things that led a certain authenticity to his performance was that he used the actual wigs owned by Andy Warhol. Other performances of note were small but pivotal roles by Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, Dennis Hopper, Paul Bartel, Courtney Love, Tatum O'Neal, and Parker Posey. Posey posed as gallery owner Mary Boone. If you've never seen Parker Posey in The House of Yes do yourself a favor and watch it right NOW!

Andy Warhol: I don't like beer.

Jeffrey Wright gives a great performance as Jean-Michel Basquiat, but I was really knocked out by the supporting cast. Besides the above mentioned, Benicio Del Toro was great as Basquiat's buddy, Benny Maldau, Gary Oldman, a man who can do justice to roles as diverse as Sid Vicious and Beethoven, gave another great performance as Milo, an Artist that no doubt represented Director Julian Schnabel himself, and finally Claire Forlani was fantastic as Basquiat's girlfriend, Gina. She was also great in a little film called Boys and Girls, a film that never found its audience because it was a little too thoughtful for the usual audience of co-star Freddie Prinze, Jr. (Freddie Prinze, Jr. was also good in this one, though it pains me to say it).

The Electrician: I'll be forty in July, and I'm glad I never got recognition. It gives me time to develop.

There is a quasi-documentary that is good to compare and contrast with this movie called Exit Through the Gift Shop. It follows Graffiti Artist Banksy, and also examines the theme of how the gallery system assigns value to Art, and how Graffiti Art is entering the mainstream. Banksy's Art is a lot like Andy Warhol's, but instead of lithographs it is done with stencils and spray cans. The documentary also documents an Art Show for an Artist called Mr. Brainwash. Don't want to get into this tangent right now, but there are some interesting parallels to explore. Both Basquiat and Banksy began as Graffiti taggers.

This was Julian Schnabel's first outing as a film director, and it is very impressive. A lot of the choices and use of images are refreshing and painterly. Some unusual music choices also prevailed, with mixed results. For instance, in the beginning it uses a song by The Pogues, ""Fairytale in New York."" The mood is right but somehow jarring. Was this chosen for its title, a way of saying that we are about to see a fairy tale or a fable in New York? If so, that is a bit heavy handed. All in all, though, I would say that the choices Schnabel made as a director were very artistic. The Bottom Line is that Basquiat is a very good film, whether viewed as a Fable, as Art Criticism, or just as Art. It even works as a movie.

Rene Ricard: We're no longer collecting art; we're buying people.

849676,4,6304343426,"""Basquiat"" tells about 4 years of the story of Jean-Michel Basquiat, hit of the 1980s art world, from the days just prior to his fame to the peak of his success and the beginning of his decline into drugs. The film vastly simplifies his frenetic life, but does give a glimpse into the forces -- gallery owners, museum curators and sellers -- that shape the careers of new artistic discoveries. Basquiat found himself simultaneously pulling the levers of this system while it pulled his, each seeking maximum gain and notoriety.

Basquiat's friendship with pop-artist Andy Warhol is depicted, with David Bowie doing a wonderful impression of the eccentric older artist. Christopher Walken has a cameo as an attack interviewer, alternately praising and insulting Basquiat in order to get juicy tidbits. But Jeffrey Wright is a standout as the title artist, portraying him as a street-smart naif fascinated by self-expression. He is able to portray a man on hard drugs without resorting to caricature.

You don't have to be a fan of modern art, or of its post-modern and expressionistic offshoots to enjoy the film. Enough to know that some people see this material as worthy of collecting, showing or selling, whether from its intrinsic value, for its culture currency or for its sheer sellability. Basquiat's paintings continue to sell for enormous sums decades after his death. In some circles, that's enough to make one an important artist,. regardless of what the wider public thinks.

""Basquiat"" does not go deep into the artist's life or provide a critique (positive or negative) on the world that spawns art. It did pique my interest in Basquiat and his work, and that's plenty.",1195776000,,1683,5.025089605734767

I am an artist and was completely satisfied visually, but that can happen in movies not about artists.  The sweetness, floaty quality of Jeffrey Wright's demeanor was also terribly addictive.  But more than anything was the capturing of the actual creative experience.  It makes sense that some people could say this movie is a dud because they have never experienced creativity--it's joys & tortures. So why are they reviewing this unbelievably brilliant film and artistic life when they haven't entered square one yet.  To me, it is the epitome of films--brilliant in every way.  I kept the BB movie, and came to Amazon today to buy 2 more.

Thank you Schnabel.  I myself have been inspired to return to doing lots & lots of art because of being reminded exactly of the amazing artistic experience. And I'll be buying 2 ""Before Night Falls,"" also.",1193443200,,1211,4.688679245283019

The white duke is the best ""fake"" Andy i've ever seen. Second, the film introduces to the world a great weird and loving artist, like Samo.

849683,5,6304343426,"As everthing i've ever read about Jean Michel has told me, he wasn't quite this personable but i suppose since this was done by a dear friend of JMB's then it is only fitting that Jeffrey Wright's portrayal be a bit more ""In the Sunshine"". I have been intriqued by JMB since that first time i seen this movie. This wasn't even tradgic because JMB never really changed his habits in this movie. All great artists seem to be here today gone tommorow...This movie seemed to give a real good look at the ever different world of an artist...espcially one connected to the who's who of this times art world. David Bowie is entertaining as Andy Warhol...Benicio Del Toro is just good in every movie he's in and A brief appearance by Christopher Walken seemed to add bit of humor to this tale of a young artist who had the world at his feet but was too stoned and paranoid to care about it. I love his art but one has to admitt that all the great one's are more then ""different""...they walk in different sunight then we do. For instance...(in the movie) money meant nothing to JMB, drugs were like coffee to him and he was alarmingly carefree about most things. In this portrayal of Jean Michel Basquiat, Jeffrey Wright really seemed to hurt in the scenes regarding JMB's relationships, both romantic(Claire Forlani is very convincing as JMB's steady for most of the movie) aswell as with his friends. JMB didn't trust a lot around him. The one message that came clear to me was that Jean Michel longed to be excepted as an""ARTIST""...not a ""BLACK ARTIST""...he didn't see color and it angered him and hurt him at the same time at the fact that the world saw him as a black man/artist. He was called the ""Eddie Murphy"" of the art world and had an alias of ""SAMO""(He graffitied this name ...short for ""samo s - - t"")...to me he was a brilliant artist who invited me into the world of art and showed me some of the tradgic ways that talent can be thrown around...wow, to be gifted like that...This is an insightful look into the life of Jean Michel Basquiat...American Artist",1183420800,3,2063,4.504
849754,3,6304343426,"The story of Jean Michelle Basquiat is probably pretty typical of a NYC artist during the period when Andy Warhol was famous for being famous. It touches lightly on the idea of art being a commodity and important only if ""the right people"" think it's important but nothing is concentrated on enough to make this anything more than a mediocre film. Not the art scene at the time,not the artists, not Basquiat's relationships and certainly no insight into his art. Actually, that's probably better left unknown. It has some historical merit but alot of the characters seem cliche even though they are supposed to be real people. And, I'm not sure what movie alot of reviewers were watching but David Bowie as Andy Warhol is atrocious. He is completely unbelievable and does what looks like Bowie might have done if he was trying to imitate Warhol for some friends. It's an unpolished one dimensional performance of a major character. The movie was of interest to me just to see what a ""famous artist"" was really like and how they became famous. Pretty standard though. More hype than talent.",1170028800,2,1089,4.797872340425532

849756,5,6304343426,"Biopics, as a rule, so oversimplify and sentimentalize their subjects that it's rare to find one that presents a plausible picture of a life actually lived. To have lived such a brief life, as young Basquiat did, may seem to come to the aid of the 90-minute filmmaker, but that this story of a brilliant New York street artist comes across as believable at all is a testament to the performances, the script, and the direction. The only thing really missing in this film is an appreciation of Basquiat's works themselves. Maybe you leave that for the Learning Channel.

Jeffrey Wright is just fine as the troubled and gifted artist who became an overnight sensation in the New York art world and then, according to writer/director Julian Schnabel (who should know) was more or less eaten alive by it. And he holds his own with a supporting cast of notables including Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Parker Posey, Benicio del Toro, and others, including David Bowie as a wonderfully sympathetic Andy Warhol. While you may take exception to the accuracy of the film, you find yourself accepting it as a portrayal of a certain kind of life that has been regarded from the beginning as larger than life - and any resemblance to Van Gogh is intended from the start. The richly varied music track, including snatches of Miles' Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" is also wonderful.",1160956800,6,1378,4.814345991561181
849757,4,6304343426,"This is a visually stunning film, very beautiful to see, which appears to capture the insanity of art world fame and fortunes.

The film opens with a young child Basquiat and his mother visiting Picasso's Gurnica, where the mother begins to cry while her son imagines a glowing crown upon his little head. It was images like this that are integrated throughout the film.

What is this film really about? Is it about the rise of a brash young outsider talent who bashes down the doors of fame but then crumbles under the spotlights? Is it about a virile and brave youth whose talents are sucked away by insider vampires of the in-crowd art world? Is it about a melancoly talented Black man who drifts into constant drug use as he becomes lost in the market place with no real compass (except Andy Warhol)? Is it about the trajectory of the hero which inevitably results in downfall and tragedy as a result of the fatal moral flaw that results in his undoing? The answer is ""yes"", it is all of this.

Jeffrey Wright, the brilliant actor from Syriana and Angels in America, does a super job playing Basquiat. Basquiat's creative style is reactive and compulsive, full of energy, full of chance and doodles and street drawings. It allows multimillionaires the opportuntiy to taste the funky hard vibrant streets while sitting comfortably in their park avenue apartments. Thus Basquiat became a commodity and the bidding war around him reveals the cut throat profit seekers of the art marketing world.

David Bowie is totally great as Andy Warhol. Warhol was a unique personality who actually becomes one of Basquiat's only mentors while simultaneously drawing from Basquiat's young energy. Carefully watch the scene where Warhol and Basquiat paint a large canvas together, and Warhol complains that Basquiat alters everything Warhol puts on the canvas.

Benicio Del Toro is super as Basquiat's home boy friend that finally breaks with his friend as Basquiat loses his bearings.

Parker Posey is stunning as Mary Boone, one character that does not come off well as she tries to lure Basquiat from another gallery to become her client.

Courtney Love, Willam DeFoe, Christopher Walken and others play small parts that keep the ball rolling throughout the film.

Sometimes bold talent arises from the masses, connected to this or that personality. Sometimes that personality thrives and retains their center of gravity and sometimes that personality disintegrates. This young Black man disintegrates and the social forces that contribute to that fall make for a fascinating film.",1152057600,9,2572,5.02112676056338
849758,3,6304343426,"The film ""Basquiat"" details the rise of Jean Michael Basquait from graffiti ""artist"" living on the streets to a leading figure in the art community during the 80ies. I'm sure I am supposed to be commenting on the life of the homeless, drug addict, vandal who became a rich, drug addict, artist but first I want to point out some distracting errors in the film (not errors of Basquait's history, but distracting continuity errors).

 Several times during the film Basquait left a building dressed one way and arrived at his destination with different colored clothes even though the trip was only supposed to be a few minutes. When Basquait discovers that Warhol is dead (in the middle of the eighties) there are clothing stores in the background that didn't exist until the nineties. When drawing a line through the aamco horse in Warhol's painting the line changes length from scene to scene, and the ""Rene' 5:11"" keeps disappearing and reappearing from scene to scene. It may seem nitpicky, but these were a bit distracting.

The film's self-indulgent nature was also a turn off. Julian Schnabel obviously thought very highly of this ego-centric junkie (as evidenced by attaching Saint-like attributes to Basquiat) and wants the viewers to do the same, but not being a fan of graffiti, modern art, junkies, the mentally ill, or egomaniacs I was left cold. The scenes of Basquait painting in his studio were the equivalent of watching someone throw open paint cans at the walls.

The film did, however, give a great glimpse into the smug, self-important, pretentiousness of the art world that was/is so over the top that in any other film it would have been considered parody. Also on the plus side is the performances, this film was loaded with stars who did magnificent jobs in becoming the characters they portrayed. The biggest standout was David Bowie who was just eerily convincing as Andy Warhol. The music is fantastic as well.

 So despite all the negatives the film is watchable, even if you're a philistine when it comes to modern art.",1148169600,8,2047,4.884726224783861
849759,5,6304343426,"This movie has a wonderfully talented cast.  Jeffrey Wright's portrayal of Basquiat is very subtle and quite moving and I enjoy taking in something new in his portrayal of the ill-fated Basquiat each time I view this work.  David Bowie as Warhol, Christopher Walken as the interviewer, Benicio del Toro, and even Willem Dafoe as a sculptor/electrician. Wow! Dennis Hopper in a very unusual role for him, stands out as an art collector/dealer.  The casting agent has my taste in talent as they cast all of my favorite actors and personalities in one movie!  It is definitely worth owning.",1137456000,3,587,4.898989898989899
849760,4,6304343426,"I went to the School of Visual Arts from 1977 - 1981, during the time that Basquiat ""attended"" school there, or it would be more accurate to say during the time that Jean Michel hung out at SVA's lounge and painting classes while never actually paying to attend class. Either way, the film perfectly captures both sides of the NYC art scene of that time -- the struggling, aspiring artist and the world of Soho's elite. The film has a great musical score that includes music of the day and other art school favorites. There are also some wonderfully accurate character portraits like David Bowie's Andy Warhol, Parker Posey's Mary Boone and the more obscure, but right on target: Benicio Del Toro's accurate portrayal of your average NYC (SVA, Parsons The New School) art student. The film also does an affective job of capturing the atmosphere of the late night 80s East Village parties and Soho openings and the way Warhol stepped in and out of the scene mingling with the young talent all too eager to mingle back with him. Jeffrey Wright plays Basquiat with a more Mickey Mouse-like flair than Jean Michel really had. I remember him as a loner, a little dark and more brooding, if not angst ridden at times. (My guess is this is how Wright choose to make Jean more presentable to a motion picture audience.) Anyway, the film as a whole is a heartfelt portrait from a colleague and friend Julian Schnabel, an 80's fine art painter known for his paintings involving broken dinner plates. Schnabel later became a motion picture director and directs this portrait of his friend Basquiat. If you're looking for a love letter to Jean, then this film is for you.",1137283200,19,1659,4.684931506849315
849761,5,6304343426,"I read the previous reviews, and I have to say... as an artist in NYC, this is my absolute favorite film of all time. Yes, it portrays Basquiat as a self-indulgent drug-induced brat. There are those who will understand. There are those who live this. There are those who know what it means to struggle. But for those who are artists, this movie will touch something that no film has ever touched upon in such an intense way. The struggle for success is mixed with the struggle of being successful. The world comes crashing down on you and there is ultimately no way to escape it. It happens to celebrities... it happens to artists... it happenes to anyone in the spotlight who actually has something to say to the world. The casting for this film is brilliant. I would love to talk to each and every actor and actress to find out their personal reason for being a part of this film. I feel there is so much there that isn't being said. A film like this puts to shame most contemporary films that feel the need to spell everything out and reiterate in montages. I watch this film again and again... and each time I see a different film. I may not be the typical audience. But man... what an expererience to watch this film as an artist in NYC.",1136160000,2,1242,4.380952380952381
849762,5,6304343426,"What I loved about this movie is that Jeffrey Wright showed the emotional and sensitive side of Basquiat, as well as his creative side. It showed his struggles with his personal life as it overcame his professional. The characters were so real...so human and true to life in that time. I really enjoyed this movie. It pulled me into his life....only I wish I knew more....",1127952000,3,372,4.651515151515151
849763,5,6304343426,"Of the recent films covering the lives and/or careers of artists, Basquiat is among the best.  While spanning less than 10 years in the life of this musician cum artists cum celebrity, it is all one needs to comprehend how this prodigy became overwhelmed by fame and fortune.  Juxtaposed against Warhol, who profoundly understood the dimensions of celebrity, we see Basquiat as quite the opposite--naive to the point of charming, overwhelmed at times, and utimately seduced by the all that is nefarious in a world in which booze, drugs, and sex are all there for the taking.  But this has all been seen before in the lives of people such as Belushi, Joplin, Hendrix, and a slew of others; so much that the early death of a young star seems to have become almost an archetype.  Yet it still intrigues us for multiple reasons, and, as pointed out early on in the movie, the death of an artist does seem to mystify both the work and the person.  Would Basquiat be nearly as famous now, had he cleaned up and continued painting?  We might guess that if that was the case there would probably not be a movie about him.

This serves to illuminate other burning questions indirectly offered by the film: was Basquiat really a good artist, or was he in the right place at the right time when the New York art market in the eighties was bullish in a way that will probably never be seen again?  And, is Schnabel canonizing Basquiat into the league of the mythical artist?  Whatever the answers may be, I can honestly say that my interest was thoroghly piqued, so that I was equally curious about Basquiat as I was his place and time.

Perhaps it is Schnabel the artist that shines through much of the film, moreso than Schabel the writer/director.  Basquiat the movie is replete with symbolism, both overt and covert.  To give an example of each, the narrative of the film is enhanced on several occasions by a sub-narrative of surfing--hopefully that is all you need to know.  Otherwise, the direction and cinematography seems to follow Basquiat's life and career, where choppy editing and eccentric montage play as almost as a sub-character.

It should be noted that many of the characters in the movie are in fact compounds of various people throughout his life during this time.  Of course, Andy is Andy, Rene is Rene and, largely, his art dealers are his dealers, but beyond that his friends and girlfriends in the movie generally cover multiple personages.

In the end, the tale of basquiat is tragic but compelling, and it is a movie that deserves multiple viewings, especially for those interested in the art world, or who like a good bio-pic.  Some fiction, some fact, but otherwise contextually acurate.",1124323200,7,2704,4.719148936170213
849773,3,6304343426,"First of all, the cast is excellent and the acting is very good. David Bowie is suprisingly good as Andy Warhol, and Jeffrey Wright is a standout as Basquiat. This film does a very nice job placing the artist in the context of the art scene at that time and does a fair job making you care.

Seeing David Bowie play Andy Warhol gave me a strange sense of cognitive dissonance - so many layers of pop culture woven into one very good performance. The problem is that this film makes hanging out with Andy Warhol look mundane and trashy. Money and fame apparently can't give you substance, and contrary to popular opinion, they don't make you interesting. Basquiat ultimately comes off as a self-indulgent brat who had the world handed to him and was too stoned to know it.",1113696000,2,727,4.592307692307692
849775,2,6304343426,"Biopics about artists and writers are tough to pull off.  Some, like ""Pollock"" and ""Frida,"" are qualified successes (*** for Pollock, **** for Frida).  Some, like ""Before Night Falls"" about the Cuban poet Arenas actually take off; it's a ***** film.  ""Sylvia"" falls flat (** for this film) because it captures the poet's depression but not her vitality and quotes far too little of her work, the raison d'etre of the movie itself!

""Basquiat,"" like ""Frida"" does show plenty of the visual artist's thoughtful intelligent graffiti-style art and David Bowie has a nice turn as pop artist Andy Warhol.  Trouble is:  Basquiat comes off as boring, pretentious, spoiled, and self-indulgent; in short UNLIKEABLE.  It's a similar problem in ""Total Eclipse,"" a Holland film and Leo DiCaprio vehicle about the French lyric poets Rimbaud and Verlaine.

I love biopics and I love visual artists, poets, and writers.  Folks, they've been screwing them up lately!  Here's a few rules for future cine-biographers:  1.  Give us PLENTY of the artist's work  2.  Show the vitality, charisma, and humor behind every creative personality at least as often as the depression and addiction which often attends such lives  3.  Avoid at all costs being boring; we remember these people because they're interesting!  More films like ""Finding Neverland"" (****, about writer J.M. Barrie) and ""De-lovely"" (****, about songwriter Cole Porter) please.  ""Il Postino"" is a great example of a film soaked in an artist's work (Chilean poet Pablo Neruda) that could be a great template for a Neruda bio-pic.

849776,5,6304343426,"A few moons ago I was head-over heels, totally enamoured, positively smitten, and, yes, well, semi-*obsessed*, in the ilk of certain *artsy* somewhat self-destructive early twenty-somethings suffering from the underrated, understated,yet absolutely truthful, *quarter life crisis*, with this film. Although it's been a few years since I escaped adolescence, during the aforementioned *quarter life crisis* I acquired a sort of adolescent-like affinity for ""Basquiat"", and just about everything related to the film-- from the awesome soundtrack to the spectacular artwork-- yet especially for the mythos surrounding the remarkable, fascinating, and elusive painter himself.  Not much is known about Basquiat, which must render any attempt at a filmatic portrayal of him much more difficult  and tricky, than, say, a portrayal of Andy Warhol (about whom we know quite a bit, one crucial reason being that his approach to art and art culture was far more flamboyant and forward than his *graffiti pupil*, as I've heard him called). Julian Schnabel yields a double-edged filmatic sword with ""Basquiat"": on one hand, he portrays the spirit, inner turmoil, passion, vulnerability, intensity, and the dionysian excesses of the painter with incredibly astute, intuitive, and keen vision. On the other hand, ""Basquiat"" is an impressive piece of art in itself. It stands out as a great film, again, in itself; that is to say, if we examine it on its own, apart from the genre of *biography*, and embrace the adage of *ars gratia artis*, we'll recognize its astounding and unique attributes.  Those who are unfamiliar with Basquiat or even those who dislike Basquiat as a person or as an artist, will likely appreciate many of the purely filmatic aspects of this film; for instance, its superb technical and cinematographic devices. Some film afficionados focus exclusively on these aspects of a film; *Felini buffs*, for example :). However, if you, like myself, enjoy a excellently well-crafted biopic, then ""Basquiat"" more than qualifies. Schnabel effectively and convincingly carries the viewer through Jean Michel's series of maelstrom-like transitions, from his modest-cardboard-box-in the-park-as-home beginnings to the shock of his almost instant fame, to his awkward semi-immersion into the art world, and, ultimately, to his self-inflicted demise. Perhaps for some Basquiat is not the most endearing or easily identifiable character; however, even if a viewer cannot empathize with him, s/he will likely at least admire the delicate, incisive, and sensitive manner in which the director portrays the subject of his film.  I find Basquiat, as  Schnabel represents him, to be a remarkable, enigmatic, and fascinating individual. Without resorting to the tired old cliches of the tortured, isolated, misunderstood artist, aimlessly adrift on Van Gogh's boat (a paraphrase, which I hope I haven't butchered too badly, from the beginning of the film), Basquiat was a phenomenal artist, and seems to have been an intriguing person. If this is the case, then Jeffrey Wright portrays him brilliantly; he has a really special keenness of perception regarding the character he is playing. The people in Basquiat's life are also portrayed exceptionally well (of course, it doesn't hurt that the cast is comprised of exceptional actors).  Some of the most memorable interactions in the film involve Jean Michel's introduction to Andy Warhol (David Bowie would have charmed Warhol's flouncy pants off with his portrayal of him; he's sensational as the pop-star-pop-artist), the initial mentor/pupil relationship, and their eventual friendship. There are many outstanding scenes involving Basquiat's frenzied, tumultuous relationship with his present-estranged-present-estranged girlfriend (Claire Forlani is excellent in this role; she has a particular manner of suffering and sorrowing on screen which radiates a vulnerable, fragile, and innocent sort of beauty). There are also quite a few memorable interactions between ""Benny"" (Jean Michel's drugged-out, slouchy, misguided, yet absolutely loyal friend, wonderfully portrayed by Benicio del Toro) and Basquiat. The final scene in the film, when ""Benny"" rescues a moribund Jean Michel from the gutter to which it seems he has ventured to die in semi-conscious despair, after learning of Warhol's death, is one of the most powerful I've ever seen on screen.  I'm sure I've rambled on enough about this film. . . I guess I feel as strongly about it now as I did during that *quarter-life crisis* a few moons ago, during which I sometimes even *evaluated* potential suitors by their reactions to the film. . . (!). There are a few rare films which leave such an intensely personal and indelible impression on a person's pscyhe, that (s)he may begin to feel like they belong in the film, as an honorary character, or at least as an extra. ""Basquiat"" is definitely one of these films, at least for yours truly.

They were passionate about the story and the life of Basquiat, and it shows through their performances. Jeffrey Wright is absolutely unforgettable as Jean-Michel Basquiat and David Bowie as Andy Warhol is hysterical and amazing. The film captures the essence of Basquiat - as an artist, as a person.

Couldn't get enough of Wright's brilliant job.  Del Toro is mind-numbingly interesting. There are some slips on their English accents, but Bowie and Oldman were flawless.  Everyone put on their best actor faces and played well.  The director's sketchy style perfectly matched the randomness of this story.

I happen to like modern art, a lot.  This movie may not work for people who are not into this expression..  My take one the early 80's vibe was pretty good.  I'm sure movie buffs find fault with the lack of perms.  But nevertheless, this movie is worth watching.",1099008000,2,785,4.733333333333333

Even the scenes of his ""creative process"" are meaningless, and no better than watching a wall being defaced by spray paint; somehow we are made to assume Basquiat is an inventive genius, when what the screen shows us is a man who has no respect for anyone (for instance, there is a scene where he goes to a lovely home for dinner, and urinates in the hallway), no gratitude to those who help him become famous, and is more interested in self-promotion than art.
It has a stellar cast of character actors, among them David Bowie, who shines as Andy Warhol (and is sporting one of Warhol's actual wigs), and Gary Oldman as ""Albert Milo"", which is an alias for artist and writer/director of this film, Julian Schnabel, and uses Schnabel's paintings, including one he made for Basquiat (the one he shows Jeffrey Wright/Basquiat saying he painted it for a friend who died).
The reproductions of Basquiat's work were also done by Schnabel.
Will Basquiat's work be known 100 years from now ? I doubt it; though it is lauded now, I believe time will reveal it to be no more than glorified graffiti.

The cinematography and symbolism in the film is incredible there's a scene where Basqiuat is walking down the street and sees on a regular billboard a man surfing catching  a wave which pretty much illustrates how he saw things differently than most. This film also captures that exciting time in the early 80's where art met music & fashion when artists were the superstars.  Sad story of an eccentric man  whose talent was exploited & became more of an image then a soul.

849781,1,6304343426,"Julian Schnabel pulled off some kind of coup by getting financing and a distributor for a kind of ""home movie"" that is as inept and awful as having to watch your neighbor's video of their last vacation. But unlike your neighbors, Mr. Schnabel knows a lot of actors and celebrities to do supporting parts and cameos, so any pleasure to be derived from ""Basquiat"" comes from spotting the famous names.
Jean-Michel Basquiat was a (sadly) drug-addicted and mentally ill 20 year old when he broke into the art scene in the early 80s. Of course, art is in the mind of the beholder, but to my sensibilites he was made much of because of his youth, race and a (false) belief that he was some kind of homeless ""savant"". (Actually, he was from a middle class background.) Anything interesting in his story has more to do with the pretentiousness of the ""New York Art Scene"" and how they glom onto something for a season or two, or make much of a sad, mentally ill boy until his life, expectations and whatever talent he did or didn't have is utterly wasted.
The real mystery: how the heck does Schnabel get someone of the talent and stature of Willem Dafoe to do a ""walk on"" as an electrician or Parker Posey to do a line or two as art dealer Mary Boone? There are also brief appearances by wannabes like Courtney Love, Tatum O'Neal, Dennis Hopper, etc. (Not to mention that the entire Schnabel family sans Papa is listed in the credits.) No less than Gary Oldman portrays Schnabel himself (called Albert Milo here, although I can't imagine why) and shown living like a Renaissance prince in a vast New York loft filled with giant paintings and antiques...I guess so we properly hold him in awe as a successful New York ""artiste"" and swoon at his affluence.
There is ZERO attempt here to re-create the period and society in place during the time of the events shown (about '79-83) and actors wear clothing contemporary to the later 90s, at least 15 years too modern; ditto for things like cars, music, etc. This is very disorienting -- is Schnabel trying tomake the story contemporary or is he cheap, sloppy, unaware? It's impossible to tell.
Since the protagonist is stoned AND mentally ill throughout the film -- he doesn't descend into this state as in some biopics, but starts out this way -- there is a certain amount of pity for him, but it's hard to feel any kind of identification with him. It's also embarassing
Production values and special effects -- the surfer in the sky fantasy -- are not particularly well done by current CGI standards adding to the ""home made"" overall quality of the film.
A couple of supporting actors pull out the stops to give good performances. David Bowie, who you would not think had it in him acting-wise or appearance-wise, turns in a wonderful, nuanced portrait of the uber-trendy Andy Warhol (just before the artist's death). Michael Wincott, known more for his portrayals of sinister villain types, switches gears radically to portray very gay, very swishy poet/art critic Rene Ricard, who ""discovers"" Basquiat only to be quickly betrayed as the young artist allys himself with more important and high profile ""friends"". He's very convincing in the part and I had to check the credits twice to be sure this was the same actor from ""The Crow"" and ""1492"".
But other high profile name actors are basically just doing walk-ons...I guess this is the high trendy art equivalent of a home movie. So my first analysis was dead-on.
You won't learn anything about art from watching ""Basquiat"", except that it's a very bad idea to give an artist a camera and let him make a movie.",1070064000,15,3603,4.666666666666667

The movie begins as a young Jean-Michel Basquiat witnesses a painting of some sort on a wall.  Basquiat's mother (I presume) begins to cry, but then she looks down at Basquiat who is smiling as we see an image of a halo or a crown.  Maybe this is a prelude of what is about to come for her young son?  Throughout the film we see various images of a surfer surfing the ocean.  This can relate to a young up-and-coming artist in Basquiat who climbs the latter of success; rides the waves, and of course we see his perpetual and painfull downfall.  He learns many things along the way, especially that success comes with a price.  He can never shake the negative reviews that he was ""Warhol's hanger-on,"" or a ""Graffiti writer.""  We never really know what's going on in Basquiat's head or what's fueling his artistic fire, and why he flirts with danger.  By the time that we make a pretty good asumption, again we see the image of the surfer surfing the ocean, only this time he falls and is swallowed by the waves.

  This film was the work of a fellow factory artist Julian Schnabel.  Julian wrote and directed the film.  All of the paintings in the film were Schabel's representations of Basquiat's work.
  This movie is outstanding.  The audience is presented with a very real view of the artist's life.  Although it seems sketchy at times, the air of confusion and/or paradox, adds to the film.  The only true flaw is that we are not able to see a deeper side of Basquiat.  Buit again, this is the interpretation by a man who may not have know him on that level.
  There are numerous outstanding performances--a brilliant cast--all working for pennies..  Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Courtney Love, Jeffrey Wright and David Bowie.
  Jefrey Wright's performance is alluring.  He captures the essence of the artist which basically distracts you from the flaws of the film.  The viewer gets lost in Wright as Basquiat once got lost in himself.
  Bowie does a wonderful job of capturing Warhol's unique personality.  It's almost frightening really.  Perfect choice considering Bowie met him on several occasions.
  Courtney Love's appearance is questionable.  Although, I believe she is a representation of several women who came into Basquiat's life.  Madonna?
  The film throws quite a lot at you.  The complicated relationships Jean-Michel had with various people and his absorbtion into drugs.  He constant battles are not really seen as such but really almost presented in an innocent way.  He seems as though he was a guy roaming the streets reacting to his environment.  People get angry at him, shun him--yet at the same time call him brilliant.  The film depicts his struggle with race issues and class issues which are the most fundamantal key issues of his art.

After watching it, I wouldn't mind learning more about the real Basquiat as all biopics take their poetic liberties, but to be honest I don't particularly care how factually accurate this film really is, or how good Basquiat's work may or may not have been.
That's because this film simply SHINES and stands on its own as a celebration of true artists everywhere and at any time, famous or obscure.
Just about every character is superb, from Wright to Oldman, Bowie, Del Toro, Walken, and especially the drop-dead, knock-out gorgeous Clare Forlani.  The cinematography is beautiful (makes you want to move to NYC, 9/11 be damned), the music is perfectly chosen, the dialogue flows and crackles effortlessly.

This movie is a beautifully filmed tribute to an artist by an artist. There is a scene in the film where we watch old 8mm clips of Basquiat's friend Andy Warhol. I get the feeling Julian Schnabel wished there was a big collection of 8mm home movies with which to make a tribute out of, but lacking that did the next best thing and made a movie. I felt like the whole movie was a film version of friends getting together and saying ""remember that time he...."" The film does tend to jump around a bit, and not everything is explained fully. Think back on someone close to you who died. Think of how you remember that person. Not as a complete biography, but a collection of memories. Times that make you laugh, times that make you cry, times you wish others had experienced so they can know fully what the loss means to you. This movie captures that feeling and draws you into this close group of friends. It lets you share those times from the inside. Each person is represented by at least one clip. Each person has at least one memory to share. Basquait drifts around the film in a dreamy disconnected way. These scenes are only memories. The character does not grow or change because we remember our friends the way they were when they died. We freeze them and wrap them in a protective blanket that repels all fault we may have placed on them in life. I have never watched a film that captures these feelings so well.

849849,4,6304343426,"Most recently I've had a deep intrest in the art and the life of
Jean Michel Basquiat.
I started exploring my curiousity with this 1996 film directed by Julian Schnabel-a fellow artist of Basquiat-entitled simply ""Basquiat"".Playing the execently-acted role of Basquiat is Jeffrey Wright(future star of John Singleton's 2000 remake of ""Shaft"").
Although this film is hyped as a biopic,it's more an expressionist
look into Basquiat's mind.
Basquait is depicted as a man-child genius with a troubled family
(his mother would get locked into a mental hospital
as the films shows in a chilling scene)
and a reckless attitude. This is a journey of the mind of a man who knew that success was a given for him.
But the one thing I don't like about this film is that it's not really a proper biopic. It doesn't show Basquiat's severe depression to you,it shows it in the mind of Basquiat. That may turn some people off who would like to see a clear narrative of the life of the artist. We see several scenes of Basquiat snorting coke or smoking weed for pleasure while riding in his limo or pondering his next masterpiece. But it's shown in an arty context.
David Bowie gives an ingenious performance as Andy Warhol-who Basquait later befriended in the last years in his carrer and his life(Basquiat died at age 27 in 1988 of a herion overdose).
It makes me wonder why Bowie doesn't do more acting projects because he's a really good actor.
This film features an all-star cast which features Bencino Del Tero,Courtney Love,Michael Wincott,among others and an excellent soundtrack,which features greatly emotional,moody music from
the likes of Public Image Ltd.,P.J. Harvey,Tom Waits,
etc.(""Basquait""'s ending credicts roll to Lenoard Cohen's hauntingly beautiful ""Hallejuah"".
Altough I must complain that with the exception of Miles Davis'
""Flamingo Sketches""
and some Charlie ""Bird"" Parker compostions-not much jazz(that was Basquiat's favorite
music) is heard in this film.
Jean Michel Basquiat,along with Jimi Hendrix,Tupac Shakur,and
Miles Davis,was a brilliant,intriguing,mysterious black man that lived and played hard and died young(with the exception of Miles).

Although this film focuses on New York art scene and on Basquiat as an artist, it also raises serious issues without being preachy.  For instance, when asked during his first exhibition whether he considers himself a black artist, Basquiat (who was of a mixed racial heritage) replies to the man: ""Do you consider yourself a writer or a white writer?""  I think that sums up Basquiat's views about race and about art: he was an artist first and everything else second.

849901,4,6304343426,"Painter Julian Schnabel made his film directing debut with his impressionistic biography of his late friend and fellow '80s Warhol hanger-on, Jean-Michel Basquiat.  A charismatic, young heroin addict, Basquiat started out as a graffiti artist who called himself SAMO (as in samo bulls--t) and, depending on where your aesthetic tastes fall, his success represented either a great rebirth of artistic orgininality OR yet another sign that the American art scene was becoming a victim of trendiness.  The same, of course, was said of Schnabel at the same time.  Luckily for myself as a viewer of this film, I'm in the former camp.  For the latter group or the growing number of people who see, ""I don't know nothing about art but I like what I see,"" as the height of critical thinking, this film probably isn't for them.
Told in a freeform fashion, Schnabel's vision of Basquiat's life is rather uneven.  The story is occasionally rather muddled (Basquiat's rise from homeless drug addict to prodigal Warhol son seems to come out of nowhere) and plotwise, Schnabel is rather conventional in his structure -- Basquiat reaches the heights of fame and forgets all of his former friends before being redeemed at the end.  (His own eventual death of a heroin overdose isn't shown beyond a title card at the end credits -- though the film strongly hints it was related to his own depression concerning the death of Andy Warhol.)  However, the film is also blessed with occasional flashes of genius that make this a film that is worth watching.  Not surprisingly, Schnabel has a strong visual sense and he uses his limited budget to his advantage, capturing a strange sort of grimy fantasy world.  Some of his enigmatic images are haunting.  Basquiat continually sees an image of a lone figure surfing whenever he looks up to the sky.  Why does this child of New York have this surfer in his head?  No explanation is given or really needed.  The surfer just happens to be there, just as Basquiat's artistic talent just happened to be there -- unexplainable but definitely real.
Schnabel also proves himself to be a capable director of actors.  The film is full of cameos from the actors who always seem to show up in independent, art cinema and at first sight, the cast list looks a little self-conciously hip.  At the same time, the celebrity casting somehow works brilliantly.  Early on in the film, Basquiat stares through a window at the Warhol crowd standing in an art gallery.  That ""crowd"" is made up of David Bowie, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, and several other recognizable faces and its somewhat jarring to see all of these familiar actors gathered together -- just as it was probably jarring for Basquiat to stare at the ""icons"" of his world.  Plus, for the most part, these actors all give strong performances and don't just coast on their image.  Bowie, especially, surprised me as Warhol.  Its not a deep performance but at the same time, he never allows the artist to become a fey caricature.  Parker Posey is wonderfully haughty as gallery owner Mary Boone while unusually restrained work comes from unexpected sources like Dennis Hopper, Paul Bartel, and Willem DaFoe.  Christopher Walken has a wonderful cameo as a pretentious interviewer and nicely satirizes his own intense image.  Of the supporting cast, the four strongest performances are given by Clare Forlani (who has never been allowed to be a strong and sexy as she is here as Basquiat's lover), Michael Wincott and a pre-traffic Benecio Del Toro (playing early friends of Basquiat -- Del Toro especially has some hilarious monologues early on), and Gary Oldman who is basically playing Julian Schnabel and brings a wonderfully arrogant glee to his scenes.  (A highlight, late in the film, is the image of Oldman dancing with his daughter in front of one of Schnabel's trademark epic canvasses).
The best performance and the linchpin that holds the film together comes from Geoffrey Wright who found his first taste of fame playing the doomed Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Wright, quite simply, is a revelation.  He brings a touch of childlike vulnerablity to a character who isn't always extremely sympathetic and manages to add a much needed cohesion to Schnabel's uneven composition.  His scenes following Warhol's death are especially haunting.  Much as Schanbel's second film introduced many of us to Javeir Bardem, Basquiat serves as an introduction to Wright as well.  When Wright sees his surfer, you don't wonder what a surfer's doing above the New York skyline as much as you share Basquiat's (and Wright's) excitement at what possibilities the future might hold.",1003363200,52,4635,4.959896507115136

849904,5,6304343426,"Basquiat (Julian Schnabel, 1996)

Schnabel has made two films in five years. I'm still wondering why the man hasn't yet been immortalized. Less talented directors have gotten stars on the Walk of Fame for less accomplishment than Schnabel showed with his second film, Before Night Falls, alone. His first, Basquiat, is damned close to being as good, and yet it fell almost completely below the radar of American cinema upon its release, despite a stable of talent so broad it's almost ludicrous.

Schnabel (played in the film by Gary Oldman, incidentally-- and Schnabel's real-life family plays Oldman's family in the film. heh.) gives us the story of Jean-Michel Basquiat, one of the brightest lights of New York's avant-garde art movement in the seventies and eighties before his 1988 overdose. Basquiat himself is played by the always-engaging Jeffrey Wright (recently seen giving Sam Jackson trouble in _Shaft_), and while the film never fails to center on Basquiat himself, Wright's brilliantly low-key performance seems almost a backdrop for a slew of A-list actors in minor roles (Willem Dafoe, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Tatum O'Neal, etc.) and up-and-coming stars who have since gone on to eclipse even Wright (Benecio del Toro, Courtney Love, Vincent Gallo, Linda Larkin, Caire Forlani, Michael Badalucco, et al.). But the show is truly stolen by David Bowie as (a believable, believe it or not) Andy Warhol. Bowie doesn't do a whole lot of acting, but when he does, he's usually wonderful at it (viz. The Hunger, Christiane F., etc.). He takes it to new heights here, and Bowie and Wright give a sense of the friendship between Warhol and Basquiat that does far more in far less screen time than most buddy movies could dream about. Of course, that may be because Schnabel, an artist himself, is a virtuoso at conveying the shallowness of the New York art scene. What's more, he manages to do so without turning Basquiat into a shallow film. Not an easy task, by any means.

849905,4,6304343426,"Artist Julian Schnabel in his directorial debut captures the essence of the avant garde art world of the late nineteen seventies through the eighties. His screenplay focuses on Jean- Michel Basquiat, a street person who started his career as an artist known for his memorable graffiti. Basquiat later catapulted to fame as the first African American artist to break out into the lily white New York art world, becoming pals with the likes of Andy Warhol. His struggle for acceptance and his inner demons ultimately proved to be too much for him, however, and at twenty eight, the world of Basquiat came to a stunning conclusion from an overdose of heroin.

The role of Basquiat is deliciously and memorably played by Jeffrey Wright who portrays Basquiat as a fey sort of soul. His stunning portrayal of the artist is neatly counterbalanced by the earthy performance of a young Benicio Del Toro who plays Basquiat's friend. David Bowie is perfectly cast as an other worldly Andy Warhol. Dennis Hopper and Courtney Love also give compelling performances, as does Gary Oldham.

This is a quirky, surprisingly good film in the best indie tradition. It is quintessential New York in feel. Native New Yorkers will know what I mean. Others will simply have to take my word for it. Like the city, the film has something for everyone.",992044800,11,1325,4.884444444444444

The movie just captures New York so well. Everyone seems to have their own agendas there, but it's a place where a guy like Basquiat, who lived in a box for awhile in Central Park, could rise to glory. It's a good story about his rise and fall, although the movie wavers a bit toward the end. It slips a bit when it decides to be so blatantly over-dramatic about this bum-turned-artist's demise.
By the way, has Del Toro ever had a bad movie role? This guy really knows how to pick 'em, and you'll be sad when he disappears out of the entire middle of the film when Basquiat becomes hot stuff. Del Toro's character is a nice reminder that friends should be valued more than fame, even if they are a bit eccentric. I've seen better work from Hopper and Oldman, but they do a nice job of rounding out a pretty solid movie that no one seems to have seen.
Any way, the movie is worth a rental at the very least. The ending is a bit schmaltzy, but you should be sufficiently wrapped up in Wright's acting by then. Some will still find it depressing, or worse, annoying. 3.5 stars (but I'll be kind and round up to 4)",988156800,3,1361,4.341176470588235

Basically, if you feel that Warhol was unimaginative, or that contemporary art is obtuse & undignified, you probably won't like this film. Go watch M-TV or something.
My big gripe is that Miramax hasn't released this beauty on DVD yet.(*) I mean, come on! It's been, what, 5 years since it's release?

(*) It seems that somebody, somewhere likes me.  Not only does it look like there will indeed be a dvd edition, but it's coming out a week before my birthday (according to the fine folks at Amazon).  Whoo-hoo!",987897600,,1257,4.657657657657658
849909,1,6304343426,"Basquiat's life is terribly interesting and I was pleased to see a film about it.  But Julain Schnabel, making the ""bold"" move from painting to cinema, scores a big zero with this doobie.  Total inattention to detail-- this move not only doesn' t look like it takes place in the early eighties (90s hair and clothes, and even cars), it's also a mess of a screenplay and the acting is purely laughable.  Deep failure.  This movie is insultingly bad.",984096000,8,448,4.632911392405063
849965,3,6304343426,"I believe this film needed to be made to give people some insight into Basquiats life. It was certainly eye opening for me. I really bought it to see Benicio Del Toro, who as usual, was great, though his part was small. He did the movie as a favor to the director, I think because he believed it was important to show Basquiats story. In the end he is Basquiats only real friend.",983404800,,379,4.205479452054795

Anyway, i saw the movie because i'm a big fan of Benicio Del Toro, he's an incredible actor indeed, he's sooo good, so talented and so quirky. Also, the movie itself was very impressive.  I thought it was well written, all the actors did a superb job and i'm probably going to purchase this movie and name it as one of my favorites.

849967,5,6304343426,"You know I see all kinds of kudos giving to David Bowie, and his boring portrayal of Andy Warhol(if you want to see someone pull off Andy Warhol,check out the movie,""I Shot Andy Warhol. The guy who portrays him(Andy in that movie, did a better job). Anywho,I love this movie, for the fact that you don't really get to see too many black artists'lives portrayed on film. And like I stated in the heading of my review,I hope this movie is being seen by young inspiring artist of color(you,too can start off being a graffiti artist, and turn that into something good). The other reason I like this movie, was Michael Wincott. Who I think pulled off the lead role very well. Why this movie isn't on dvd, I'll never understand. Anyway,purchase this movie. You'll love it.",979516800,,766,4.598540145985401
849968,4,6304343426,"This was a great film.  Yes, David Bowie was fantastic.  But I think Jeffrey Wright's use of restraint and subtlety should be applauded as well.  I also loved Benicio Del Toro's performance - he plays an addict and a friend to Basquiat well, using his voice to create his character.
Sometimes films are not made so that the audience will feel sympathy towards one or another characters, or to inform or to sway opinions.  Sometimes films are made simply to tell a story, be it truth or fiction.  I feel that ""Basquiat"" told a great story.
Schnabel shows us what we need to see to understand the relationships between the characters; we don't see everything that happens but we don't need to.  The missing action can be gleaned from conversations between Basquiat and Andy Warhol for example, or during the interview scene. Sometimes the mere implication of a relationship dynamic is enough to establish an understanding of the entire relationship; Schnabel uses this technique well. I don't feel the film was meant to cover everything in Basquiat's rise to fame, only what's necessary to create a feeling of beauty, appreciation for Basquiat's work and motivations, and understanding of a variety of people in New York City in the early-early 80's.
I loved the music in the film, which ranges from Miles Davis to David Bowie.  It makes you feel like you're in Basquiat's head, experiencing his drug-induced hazes, his artistic revelations.  It's also great for setting the tone of the time period of the film.
And I say to those who did not get a lot out of watching ""Basquiat:"" see it again, you never know what you may have missed the first time around; sometimes things need to be given a second chance, even films.",976752000,,1718,4.780405405405405

Those of us that have tried to keep to a  vision that sat with us in coffeeshops or street corners, or park benches  will understand this artistic genius.  Unfettered by fear, he chose to  paint.  Many artists will watch this, and turn to their art.  If you are  not moved to make your art beautiful, then you missed something, something  beautiful.",958521600,9,528,4.56989247311828
849970,1,6304343426,"If it wasn't for the movie, I may never have known Basquait.  I just wanted to see a movie about a black man who paints since I was sick and tired of all of the gangster and slave movies.  Anyway, I went to a theater  to see this one. What a mind numbing mess!  There were a waste of  interesting characters in it that did nothing but babble, and Jeffrey  Wright was about as animated as cold grits. I couldn't understand a word  the man said! This movie needed subtitles big time! I understand that he  was trying to capture the true ways of the real drugged out Basquait, but  did he really have to go that far? There was only one moment I remember  from this movie, and that was when I chuckled while watching David Bowie's  cheeky Andy Warhol having a mild pointless argument at a restaruant.  If  the purpose of this movie is to tell a tale about someone's life, it failed  miserably. All I know from this film is that Basquait made horrible  paintings.",950659200,7,958,4.303370786516854
849971,3,6304343426,"To most, the world of Jean Michel Basquiat, or of director Julian Schnabel (for that matter), is a fantastic, distant place. This movie does absolutely nothing to bring that world closer, but it does give us a  wonderful look at the world of art, and a painful but personal view of  lower Manhattan.
The superb cast is lead by Jeffrey Wright and we get  one of our first looks at the luminous Claire Forlani. Many will talk of  David Bowie's brilliant portrayal of Andy Warhol (it is brilliant), but I  stack the performances of Dennis Hopper, Michael Wincott, and  Gary Oldman  right there with him.
Basquiat led a tragic existence and suffered an  untimely but hardly unforeseen death.  He is portrayed as a pure artist in  the sense that he seems oblivious to anything one might deem conformist or  responsible. Whether or not this is truly biographical, or artistic license  we do not know, but why would be bothered by historical  inaccuracies?
It's all a fantasy world anyway.",949622400,,982,4.773809523809524

The cast was superb--I especially loved how David Bowie portrayed Andy Warhol.  How  poetic. The story was good, too, although at times I admit it was difficult  to follow-I didn't get that part with the surfer in the sky at all. I hate  it when people try to put some visual avant-garde thing in to use as a  metaphor for something else.  Just stick to the story at hand and forget  about the surfers!  Good movie overall, worth seeing at least once.",944524800,8,590,4.330275229357798

The problem lies within the fact that Oldman (who is also great, by the way) portrays 80's art icon Julian Schnabel(although in a pseudonym) who also happens to be the director of the film. If you can imagine your contemporary/competitor telling your story with no input from you or your family after your untimely demise, then you have the prism at which to view ""BASQUIAT.""  Now, I have no idea as to whether Basquiat was jealous of Schnabel, but that's how the character comes off to me. And the movie portrayed him as some  stoner-street kid that just ""happens"" to become famous by accident, as if he his talent and determination had nothing to do with his success. Like I said before, it is a good starting point, but once you learn about Basquiat, the more unpalatable the movie becomes.",1510876800,,869,4.673202614379085
