The beginning of the movie is not very dynamic, as you will see a number of disconnected quite gruesome scenes describing personal dramas of main characters, the pace becomes really intense with the death of one of them.

Some actors were doing their parts in the movie really great. I particularly admired the excellent performances of Hee Ching Paw (Auntie Mui). She should have received an Oscar for this one.

6228633,5,B00HUX3IYK,This is a tale of a man and the inhabitants of the building he moves to.  Asian ghost stories are one of my favorite genres and this film delivers in high quality.

6228635,5,B00HUX3IYK,"A formerly successful martial arts actor, down on his luck, dirt-poor, estranged from his family and suicidal, moves into a cheap, shabby apartment in a creepy building that turns out to be haunted in Rigor Mortis, a film that effectively takes diverse genres and subgenres and melds them all together into a dark and brooding, weird and imaginative martial arts horror drama.  The actor, Siu-Ho Chin (played by....Siu-Ho Chin, eerily enough) is now part of a loose 'extended family' of the building's residents, which includes normal people going about their admittedly bleak lives as well as ghosts, otherworldly entities, and a practioner of black magic, among others.  The viewer comes into this strange, dark, purgatory-like world and encounters its inhabitants and mysteries at the same time as Siu-Ho, who eventually finds that things are even stranger than they at first appear, and finds himself heading toward a major culmination of weird events.

Rigor Mortis (original Cantonese title - ""Geung Si"") is intended partially as an homage to the history of Chinese horror movies, especially the Hong Kong horror movies of the 1980s.  I'm a big fan of Asian horror (and Asian movies in general), but watching this and thinking back, I realize I've seen lots of Hong Kong (and other Chinese) horror from the 2000s, but virtually nothing further back than that (an oversight I'm planning on correcting).  So I don't know have anything from the 80s to directly compare it to, but apparantly black magic wizards and vampires were plentiful in that era's HK film output.  In the case of the latter, hopping vampires to be specific.  Don't laugh.  Apparently they were used in a number of horror comedies, but also in more straight horror movies.  How on Earth, you may be asking yourself, can a 'hopping vampire' be anything other than comedic?  I had kind of wondered about that one myself.  Well, the creature in Rigor Mortis is pretty bloody effective.  It could be said to move by hopping, but at the same time it looks like it's sort of 'swimming' through the air in an utterly unearthly and inexplicably frightening manner.  It's just one of the creatures and themes from Hong Kong horror featured here.  It should be mentioned that if you've only seen Chinese horror movies from recent years you'll still recognize a few familiar motifs.  (And if you've never seen a Chinese horror movie, I would recommed the original The Eye, Re-Cycle, and The First Seventh Night for starters.  In addition to Rigor Mortis, not instead of.)

There's a point about the ending that I wanted to make without being too specific.  That's because if taken one way, it admittedly negates a lot of the movie.  But taken another way, which I didn't even see at first, it actually opens open a whole new dimension of eerieness.  I'd be a bit more specific if I could, but I don't know how without coming right out and referencing the final scenes directly.  I'll just say that if you at first find the ending disappointing and not fitting in with the rest of the movie, there are alternate ways to interpret it once you think about it a bit.  Sorry if that's still kind of vague.

Regardless, Rigor Mortis is one of the best of the recent Hong Kong horrors, with every facet from the acting to the lighting well handled.  Certain scenes are extremely eerie and even unnerving, others strangely beautiful.  The 'spirit procession' through the hallway comes to mind.  It's quite bleak most of the time, and I've always thought that that was one of the hardest moods in a horror movie to pull off right.  Rigor Mortis does it right, and also finds ways to insert touches of a dramatically brighter, more inspirational nature, without the two clashing and without it seeming contrived.  The different elements and moods suit each other completely, and help Rigor Mortis to win an easy five-star rating.",1440979200,3,3882,4.858662613981763

6228638,5,B00HUX3IYK,"Whether you are a fan of vampire lore, of the more flamboyant ghost flicks that have emerged from Hong Kong cinema, or simply a fan of Asian horror, Rigor Mortis is well worth a view. This  visually arresting horror fantasy is set entirely within the confines of a high rise. The first half is creepy, and unfolds at a deliberate pace. As the plot thickens the pace picks up and hurls the viewer toward a breathless, action-oriented climax. It is beautiful to look at and fun to watch.",1437350400,,485,4.511363636363637

6228641,5,B00HUX3IYK,"""Rigor Mortis"" offers a fantastical fantasy world of horror, drama and Hong Kong action. The story is multi-layered with lives tangled in a hellish fate. There are elements of melodrama and gore that move in a wonderful ballet of emotion and carnage. I feel that the story works as a modern retelling of some ancient Chinese fable, the concepts and character development seem so complex and powerful that it just screams of morality wisdom from the past. Either way it is a tale that embraces both the old supernatural beliefs and contemporary style that proves Hong Kong's dominance over this blended fantasy/horror genre.

The special effects and soundtrack utilized in ""Rigor Mortis"" is top notch. The sounds are creepy, often creating a dark atmosphere of desperation scene after scene. The sets where depressing, lifeless tombs of fading lives that would send chills up Takashi Shimizu and Clive Barker's backs. ""Rigor Mortis"" uses some pretty spectacular CGI and practical effects for the fantasy and horror elements. Epic visual moments weave into the film in true whimsical opulence while the blood soaked gore combined with the chilling horror scenes create a nightmare fantasy that captivates and entertains. Just based on ""Rigor Mortis"" as an independent entity untethered from it's inspiration, homages and such I found this to be one of the best horror/fantasy films that I have ever seen.",1432080000,,1402,5.176211453744493
6228642,4,B00HUX3IYK,"I give it a 4 star because it has some quite captivating images and appealing cinematography. It's not so much scary as visceral, due mainly to the squishy sound affects.

6228645,4,B00HUX3IYK,"Rigor Mortis. A nice mix of Asian supernatural ghost story, vampires & martial arts. Produced by Takashi Shimizu, director of Ju-On (The Grudge). Now first off, the great folks at WellGo USA have included the English dub as well as the original language. I choose to watch it subbed as I do all my Asian films. That said, the movie was a nice surprise. It used the actor of an old Asian film called Mr. Vampire. The building its set in has an oppressive almost claustrophobic feeling. I think the film opens up pretty well, lags a bit in the middle but picks up greatly in the last act. All the actors are very good in the roles they play, the few martial arts scenes there are, are done very well. The ending also came as a bit of a surprise to me cause I didn't expect it & thought it was one of the better parts of the film. Everything builds quite nicely to the climax I thought. If you are a fan of Asian horror, martial arts or just Asian films in general I think youll find Rigor Mortis a very pleasant watch. Ive only recently discovered WellGo USA films & I must say of the films ive purchased so far, ive been more then pleased with their quality.",1423526400,,1157,4.239819004524887

6228653,3,B00HUX3IYK,"This movie was a little more slow paced and drawn out than I thought, but all the actors are very talented Hong Kong veterans. The drama in this movie is top notch, even for a Hong Kong movie, which sometimes will overlook quality over substance. The dramatic scenes are very good and there are a few side characters than constantly threaten to steal the spotlight from the lead actor in this movie. The ending is a little strange and either you'll love it or hate it, but the movie overall was not bad and it is a homage to the Hong Kong Mr. Vampire movies of the 80's and 90's. If you're even vaguely familiar with the Mr. Vampire movies and ""Hopping"" vampires, you'll get a kick out of this movie. It does have elements of modern day Japanese horror in it, but not too many that are off putting by any means.",1413158400,,811,4.30718954248366
6228654,4,B00HUX3IYK,"Rigor Mortis is a Honk Kong horror/action films produced by Takashi Shimizu, creator of the Grudge film series.  Chin Siu-ho is a down and out former film star who moves into a dilapidated apartment complex which is home to sorcerers, vampire hunters, ghosts, and several oddball residents.  Upon arriving, the depressed Chin attempts to hang himself.  His body is possessed by pair of female spirits who are driven off by Mr. Lau, a former vampire hunter.  Chin meets several of the other residents including Yang Feng and her albino son, Pak and Auntie Meiyi and her husband Uncle Tung.

Tung falls down the stairwell and dies, breaking his neck.  His body is found by Gau, a sorcerer who practices black magic.  Gau preserves Tungs body and offers to resurrect him for Aunt Meiyi.  When the ritual fails to work, Gau employs darker means, using the blood of a virgin to bring Tung back to life as a Jiangshi, a type of Chinese vampire.  Tung becomes even more powerful when he is possessed by the two female spirits as he rampages through the apartment.  Chin and Mr. Lau have to team together to stop the deadly spirit.

Rigor Mortis is a fantastically stylish film with visuals that often dazzle and a stunning climax.  Tungs transformation into the spirit possessed Jiangshi was a ghoulish site to behold.  Pure horror fans might be put off by the martial arts battle between Tung and the magically enhanced Chin but it was a thrilling conclusion anyway.  Its the middle portion of the film that you have to ride out in between the dynamite opening and climax sequences.

There are a lot of scenes where characters sit around and talk without much happening.  I learned more about cooking glutinous rice than I ever wanted.  Rigor Mortis has interesting characters but they just don't have much to do for long stretches of the film.  If you're looking for a different type of horror film with both action and eye-popping visuals, look no further than Rigor Mortis.",1411776000,3,1970,4.761061946902655

6228662,4,B00HUX3IYK,"mixed feelings on this one, I find it more style over scares which is true of a lot of the more recent wave of asian horror movies. I find the cinematographic style appealing with the use of CG graphics which creates an almost 3D feel but ironically that also makes it totally artificial feeling and doesn't suspend my feeling of disbelief. I find that true of things like LOTR trilogy too, so that's a modern problem I have with newer graphic styles in visuals. This movies is a pleasure to watch but it's all so artificial looking that I wasn't scared once throughout the entire Blu-ray(bought off Walmsrt for too much).

Overall this movie is a stylish asian supernatural horror movie that is poetic in it's composition and I am glad to have it in my collection, at the same time it reminds me that I miss the more tangible scares of traditional 'realistic' cinematographic makeup, props and visuals, or leaving most of the scares up to the viewers imagination which is always infinitely more terrifying.",1409616000,,1007,4.721590909090909

That said, the ending sucks. Worth watching once but, it's not a must have movie.",1408492800,,342,4.2615384615384615
6228665,5,B00HUX3IYK,"In todays horror, many films rely on shock value to get a reaction from the audience.  Whether it be from an overabundant amount of gore or a heinously sick act, shocking viewers is becoming a regular and predictable staple in the genre.  But where are the horror flicks that infuse surrealism with the terror?  There have been many over the years, and they are generally considered cult classicstitles like ERASERHEAD, VIDEODROME, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, THE BEYOND, and many more.

Im happy to announce director Juno Mak has reintroduced the world to surrealistic horror with his recent hit RIGOR MORTIS.  This dark fantasy nightmare is a visual masterpiece that will entertain just as much as it terrifies.

I was unsure about this film to start withit took me a little while to get into it.  But once I did, it blew me away.  I haven't had a film experience this satisfying in quite a while.

RIGOR MORTIS is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  The visual effects are stunningly good, but they also help tell the story.  Some films have to use visuals to draw audiences; this one uses them the way they should be used:  for plot advancement.  The result is a horror-laced trek into the bizarre.

The story itself is a nice dose of originality as well.  It is several tales woven into one, a sort of anthology that folds in on itself.  This makes for an intriguing plot, and it will keep you riveted as the scenes play out.

And what a collection of scenes they are!  RIGOR MORTIS is a feast for the eyes, to say the least.  And what it lacks in subtly, it makes it for with blunt, in-your-face terror.  This is one of those films that yanks you out of your chair and smacks you around for 90 minutesthen, just when you think its over, it gives you one last blast to annihilate your senses before it drops you back into your seat.

RIGOR MORTIS is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for original concepts in horror.  Be prepared, thoughyoure in for a heck of a ride.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, but try to check it out on Blu-ray; the HD picture and sound are definitely worth it.",1407888000,,2138,4.439588688946015

6228672,4,B00HUX3IYK,"I make it no secret to anyone that I love the movies of Takashi Shimizu. One of the most exciting moments of my career as a movie blogger was getting the opportunity to interview the talented Writer / Director / Producer. While many grew weary of The Grudge after so many spin-offs and sequels, I actually enjoyed and found most of them terrifyingly entertaining.

His other works like Reincarnation, The Shock Labyrinth, and Tormented are all fine examples of what Shimizu can do outside the box of his most famous creation.  Ive been waiting years for his film 4700 to be released either straight-to-DVD or in theaters. It looks like well have to settle for projects produced by him for a while. One of those was recently released by Well Go USA Entertainment.

Rigor Mortis is a supernatural tale featuring vampires, zombies, ghost hunters, and other creatures that haunt your nightmares. They all seem to have a fixation on the apartment building a washed-up suicidal actor moved into. As you can imagine, all sorts of very strange and disturbing occurrences unfold. Mix in some martial arts and you have a perfect homage to the classic Chinese vampire films of the past.

Rigor Mortis is presented in 16x9 widescreen with 5.1 HD Surround Sound. The natural color scheme is stylishly altered throughout giving it different moody elements. The audio features all sorts of oddly disturbing sounds for horror fans to enjoy and immerse themselves in.

Theres not much here for folks who like bonus material. All thats included is a trailer for the movie. It would have been interesting to see a Making of featurette containing interviews with the cast and crew and production footage.

Although Rigor Mortis is unrated, I would give it an R. Theres a lot of gore and disturbing horror imagery. Bad language and some nudity can be found as well.

I can definitely see why Takashi Shimizu took a liking to Rigor Mortis. After seeing the filmmakers more bizarre stylings in The Shock Labyrinth and Tormented, I perceive why he was drawn to the strange characters and peculiar phantasmagorias Director Juno Mak came up with for this unique genre entry. If you grow weary of the typical American monster movies we constantly get, Rigor Mortis is a step in a curious direction.",1405814400,,2271,4.867875647668394

The story may be hard to follow but they all tie together at the end. The underlying theme of the movie is the struggles of letting go of your pain, specifically suffering from the lost of loved ones who have either died or simply left. there are unforgettable gore scenes and definitely takes a new approach to representing spirits and ghosts.

by young Hong Kong director Juno Mak. This is his first feature film.
It is a grim, unrelenting film, without the usual comedic elements of the genre.
The devastating emotional pain of the loss of loved ones
defines the mood of the story, and it is equally important to the extreme
physical pain and gory violence of the action sequences.
Although-by hindsight-the title ""Rigor Mortis"" is revealing,

Actor Siu-Ho Chin, of Mr. Vampire (1985)fame, arrives in a run-down apartment
complex. All his belongins fit in a milk crate, and a battered suitcase
which holds the costumes of his famous roles.
His acting career is over, and he has been separated from his wife and his
beloved son. In his frame of mind, his new abode appears like a
post-apocalyptic prison. There, in his dreary cubicle #2442, crushed by
loneliness and remorse, he takes his life.
His dying brain casts the fleeting impressions of the other inhabitants
of the apartment complex into a complex narrative of traditional Chinese
Horror. There's the retired Taoist Vampire Hunter, the twin ghosts of two girls,
a corrupt priest dabbling in Black Magic, and the inevitable Chinese Vampire.
The actor reprises, for one last time, his famous screen exploits.
This is a masterfully directed, photographed and edited film, with
first-rate special effects. It is frightening and emotionally poignant
at the same time.
Blu-ray extras include the trailer of the film, a making-of featurette
which comprises conversations with the director and the principal actors,
and a small photo gallery.",1404345600,,1670,5.1208791208791204

I watched this movie because I loved Chinese Vampire movies when I was a little kid, and was super sad when they stopped making them. Now after so many years have passed, they decided to make a NEW Chinese Vampire movie. I was pretty excited getting ready to watch this movie. But, it didn't turn out exactly how I imagined it to be.

Okay, first things first, I like the name of the movie: Rigor Mortis. I had no idea what that meant until I Google it. I thought this was an excellent name for the movie. Rigor Mortis means that dead bodies goes through stiffness and the limbs become hard to move. And, if you know anything about Chinese Vampire, you know that they do not walk or run. All they do is hop and their arms are extended straight forward and stiff. Therefore, this is Rigoar Mortis effect is the perfect name for this Chinese Vampire flick.

I really enjoyed all the cast members' characters, they really played their parts well and made me believed their characters. The story made the casts member really shine in their parts.

The CGI was done very, well. This was probably the best thing to go watch this movie for. The great details, they put into making everything looked great to watch. However, the music I thought could had been better to fit the scenes being shown. It still worked out though.

Now for what I didn't like. I didn't really like the whole idea of mixing a hunted ghost apartment with the Chinese Vampire story. They made the story fit for the movie purpose, but I would rather just see one or the other. I really just wanted to watch this movie for the Chinese Vampire, and not be brother with the ghost aspects. Also, it does seem there were more showing of the ghosts than the vampire. It was interesting to see ghosts possession of the Chinese Vampire's body. That has never been done to my knowledge.

I didn't like how this movie explains everything so quickly. If you didn't fully pay attention to every single sentence, you will probably miss out on something very important. They don't tend to repeat themselves, so if you missed it--YOU MISSED IT! For example, Chin Siu-ho is the main actor you will see in this movie. I didn't know he was a former vampire hunter actor in movies before after finishing the movie. But after watching the movie and reading a review about it, I found that out about Chin Siu-ho, which made more sense now. I believe I did hear them mention it quickly, but I didn't think too much of it because it was just so quick. There were some other clues to him being a previous vampire hunter actor as well, but it didn't really hit me until I actually read it in a review. Also, it's NOT obvious thing to notice from him. This is because in the whole movie, you will see him being saved over and over again. Then, at the very end of the movie, it's amazing to see him actually know how to fight--VERY WELL. He knows what to do and how to fight off a vampire, which I was very questionable. Until I find out, oh, he was a former vampire hunter actor. Really, that made way more sense now. lol

The biggest problem I have with this movie is the story itself is so confusing. If you really understand the movie, I hope you can help me understand these questions I have about it. As I said before, a Chinese Vampire ""hops"". So, it really confusing when I saw for the very first time in the movie, the fight against it and Kara Hui (crazy housewife). They both are ready to fight each other and when Kara starts running towards it, instead of it jumping towards her, we see it just gliding motion across the floor like it was a ghost. I'm sorry, but it can't do that!!! It supposed to either jump huge leap toward her or do a lot of small hops towards her. The thing can't just slide his feet like a ghost towards her! What is it using as proportion to do that? It can't suddenly lift up on his toes and jet at her. This really made no sense. No it was possessed by the ghosts yet. That's later on into the movie.

Another confusing scene was how the Vampire just suddenly gets out of control? I thought all they had to do was leave that face mask on it. Then, it would be under control all the time. I don't know how it just went from one scene where everything is just fine and the next scene everything is out of control. I was so in disbelief. I was all of a sudden, seeing the vampire already loss its masks and is totally out of control. Also, the Dark Priest was seriously hurt. There were no explanation scenes to get to that point in between. That felt really rushed and confusing. How did it just get loose? So now it is on the rampage? Wow...

Speaking of the mask around the Vampire's mouth, is that really suppose to be the new way of controlling the Chinese Vampire? That's my guess. Before the way to control these Chinese Vampires were to stick these Chinese writing yellow papers or ""fu"" on their forehead. Once the fu were stuck on their heads, they can be control by a priest to follow his orders. But, we don't see this, so I'm guessing it's that mask thing, right?

Finally my biggest problem with this movie is the ending. It's so confusing! I'm not exactly sure why Anthony Chan (Taoist master-exorcist) had to really loose his arm. I know he was turning the metal device with his arm. It went around and around until it broke off. Really??? Who the hell says, he can't simply get up and keep on crawling around with the device while it's still turning? It's not like he's really doing anything. He doesn't need to focus on the battle between the vamp and Chin Siu-ho. He didn't get involved at all until after his arm broke off. His main job was to turn that device and keep track of the time limit they have. Therefore, he ""can"" get up and turn it. It doesn't make any sense, how he loss his arm. But, since it's supposed to be a scary movie...I guess that's how they are supposedly scaring people?

The final battle between Chin Siu-ho and the Vampire was a bit confusing as well. Chin Siu-ho was seriously injured minutes before the final battle. He was stabbed right through stomach! There was a HUGE hole! He was bleeding a gallon of blood and barely could stand up. He looked like he was barely alive at this point. I don't know how he just got up and suddenly fought the vamp like he was 100%??? My only guess is that the Taoist master somehow sent him into an alternative dimension and that supposedly got him fully healed? I don't know how that really made sense, because he should still come out of it hurt. Even if he was sent through through space, he still should be seriously hurt. Going into the alternative dimension and coming out of it, doesn't mean he's good to go. I believed he even asked the Taoist master, if he can save his life, but he said Tao Master said no. What was that part about then? So, I don't know how he ended up saving his life anyways.

Another thing is the ending after the final battle. We see Chin Siu-ho have these visions. Or at least, I think it's visions. I could be wrong, where none of what we just saw was real. This guy could had been really a true Psycho-Path, and we just saw a messed up dream sequence of his dead eyes. Then, what really happened is the alternative vision at the end. I think it is a true possibility because we see him dead at morgue. Then, we see a black tunnel with a white light in the middle, we are charging upward. Then, it shows his dead eyes too at the morgue. Then, a man said, I'm his son. Both realities were shown through his dead eyes. So, which universe was the true universe??? Who else was confused as I was at the end? What did we just see? So many questions, but no answers.

I really hate a director that gives an open-ended ending. It's like you spend 2 hours of your life watching something and you end up thinking, ""was this all a dream""??? It's open to interpretation, which SUCKS! You won't really know what happened until the director says something. Why couldn't he just make the ending end? All he needed to do is kill the Chinese Vampire - that's it! Why mess everything up and tell the audience this is a possible fake reality?

""It's like the director just slapped the audience in the face and laugh at us.""

Yes, this movie is worth watching. You should see it because it has very unique concepts. But, you might be confused and angry as I was.",1403654400,6,8429,4.3360811667723524

8636130,3,B00HUX3IYK,"I bought this film with 10 000 BC and was not really impressed. I am use to foreign martial arts style films. Like Shaolin Soccer, Mahjong Kung fu and more serious ones (i'm aware those are comedy martial arts) The reason I brought this up is because even though they are comedy martial arts films, they implemented more martial arts scenes/fights in the story. Rigor mortis is basically a murder type mystery film with the ending scene being the physical fights and 2 short scenes towards the beginning.  This isn't a bad thing, just don't expect it to be action packed. The story itself is basic. Man isolates himself in a bad part of the city, like a slum, that just happens to be haunted by a ghost of a person who committed suicide. You meet a variety of people from a black magic practitioner, retired buddhist monk and regular residents. There are a few surprises, it's not all straightforward. I just expected it to have a bit more martials arts, especially when trailers make it seem like it has them. The ghost and Chinese Vampire i'm already familiar with, so it doesn't grab my attention, however some may enjoy it because its a chinese version of them.

Like I said, it's not a bad film. It's merely passable popcorn flick.",1471564800,,1236,4.588235294117647
8636131,3,B00HUX3IYK,"Saw this on Netflix streaming. Wonderful compositions of dark doings.  Film keeps you trying to figure out who's dead -- if anyone is.  It's not a pleasant process after the 30th time the film does it to you -- BAH! At the end they tie the knots -- sorta, but nothing in the plot or characters fulfills.  It's all seems such a pointless exercise in CGI -- which was very good -- but all for naught in that the scares were all expected.  The skills and powers of the various entities was very fuzzy.  You just never knew who could muster up the mojo for the next absurd event.  Not worth a second viewing.  Film must have created out of whole cloth twenty different ""screw ball voodoo facts"" that were jarring.  Instead of a typical vampire tool set of cross, wooden stake and holy water, these vampire hunters had dozens of tricks and tools and explained almost nothing about any of it.  Ending left you in the air about whether anyone was alive or whatever and I just didn't care.  Took will power to not fast forward through some parts.  Some very derivative moments were just flat out stale memes -- the girl in white with hanging in her face long black hair etc.  Trailer was far better than the film.",1465776000,,1205,4.402714932126697

This is a Chinese movie about ghosts but not like Ringu or the others. It takes a weird premise & keeps going. A washed up former actor decides to live in an apartment complex. Unfortunately, he occupies a room that is haunted by two angry ghosts. A vampire, vampire hunter, homeless mother & child, & other odd personages are thrown into the mix. There's much gory violence.
I think this story may have resonated more if I was more familiar with Asian supernatural beliefs. The ones in the movie are very different from European ghosts & vampires.
The ending caught me by surprise and the movie was well done overall.
After I wrote this, I discovered this movie's plot & character are based off a series of famous Chinese Vampire killer movies. If you're familiar with these, this movie will be more effective versus going into it without any knowledge like I did.",1454371200,,934,4.736196319018405

I love the actor guy  Chin Siu-ho who ends up becoming like a kind hero to others, the magic, the hunters, the ghosts, the Vampire etc.
Chin vs the Vampire is an awesome fight and my favorite part of the movie. there are some ju-on parts in the movie like the 2 ghosts who move and act just like the girl in those movies. the way the little boy acts and walks as well. I am so happy Takashi and Juno got together to make this I would congratulate them if I could. I hope they get together again and do something else just as good. please see this for a action horror good time.
