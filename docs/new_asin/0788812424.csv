82094,5,0788812424,"I loved this movie almost as much as I did the original 'Angels In The Outfield'.  It has that same magic as the original movie.  It is a lot better than the low budget embarrassment, 'Angels In The Infield'.  If you're thinking of buying this movie, I give you a big two thumbs up!",1351209600,,282,4.185185185185185
82095,4,0788812424,I really liked this movie because when someone dies they leave angels behind to stay inside of you.,1259539200,,99,4.555555555555555
82096,4,0788812424,"It was a good movie, but not as good as Angels in the Outfield. I do not care for baseball but I loved Angels in the Outfield.",1251244800,,126,3.7037037037037037
82097,5,0788812424,"I saw part of Angels in the Outfield on TV one night so I hit Amazon to order it and found ""Outfield"", Infield"" and ""Endzone""...all three are great family entertainment!",1191024000,,169,4.666666666666667
82098,1,0788812424,"Dear Michael Eisner (head of disney):  Please please!  Stopping killing off parents within the first 5 minutes of your movies!  In predictable Disney formula, the dad dies at minute 7 of this movie.  The paint by numbers disney plot is one son sulks and becomes a juvenile delinquent while the other son (happy music please) continues to believe.  This movie is no comparison to the first Angels movie which was excellent.  Save your dime on this one.",1104883200,,451,4.792207792207792
82099,3,0788812424,"Granted it's no ""Angels in the Outfield"", this sequel still has alot to offer.  Based loosely upon same premise, here we have a young boy with a wish to have the family he once had prior to his father's death, he suddenly finds himself, with the help of angels, turning a losing high school football team into winners.  There are a few humorous moments and some very touching scenes which show how strength, courage, and teamwork can heal.  Even though I've seen it a number of times, I always get choked up at the end.  Our society needs more ""feel-good"" movies like this!",1061683200,6,573,4.533980582524272
82100,1,0788812424,"I can't believe there are so many reviewers who said this movie was good. It really isn't good...in fact, it's horrible, and isn't worth your time. The acting is slow and so bad you'll wretch, and the plot is entirely predictable. The most spectacular waste of 90 minutes of my life next to any Lifetime movie.",1035072000,2,310,4.553571428571429
82101,3,0788812424,"A follow-up to ""Angels in the Outfield,"" this time the angels, led by quirky Christopher Lloyd (Taxi, Back to the Future(s), are assisting the Westfiled High School Angels.  Jesse Harper's Dad was a star here, back when the Angels really played football. By the time son Jesse is old enough to play, they have sunk to the bottom of the league.  Dad dies in a tragic accident on the way home to celebrate Jesse making the team.  Jesse blames himself, has quit the team, and is sliding down a precarious moral slope.  His younger brother Kevin (David Gallagher) is the ""true believer"" and the real star of the show. He prays for Divine Intercession and receives it.  The finale is, predicably enough, a game pitting the Westfield Angels against the Screaming Demons.
The Announcer up in the booth at the games is well worth the price of admission.  The funniest line is delivered by Westfield's coach to the European exchange student/soccer player/kicker, who is so happy to have made the team, that he ecstatically kisses the coach.  In a paraphrase of Tom Hanks' great line in A League of Their Own: ""There is no kissing in football!""",1014508800,13,1134,4.725888324873097

82126,3,0788812424,"2 and 1/2 but closer to 3... Christopher lloyd is a good actor, this one was much weaker than the 5 star angels in the outfield.  And this one was straight to DVD.  But the story is clean for all ages, and didn't bore me entirely.",1381276800,,230,3.9782608695652173
