8550198,5,B00ADRYG78,"I own most of these comics so I definitely needed this in my collection, an amazing tv show that had great episodes.",1480291200,,116,4.318181818181818
8550199,3,B00ADRYG78,"This is another of those Warner Studios print on demand DVD's and this one does not play on my Sony DVD player. Others like this do. Not sure why, and not sure that returning it for another copy will solve the problem. I am able to watch it on another DVD player in the house, but being restricted to just one is not a good thing.",1426204800,,330,4.015151515151516

8550201,5,B00ADRYG78,I used to watch Korg with my brother when I was young so when I saw that it was available through Amazon I found that I was eagerly wanting to watch this again.. for old times sake.. And I must admit I still enjoyed it very much.. AAA+,1402531200,,235,3.9166666666666665
8550202,5,B00ADRYG78,"I had been hoping that someone would release Korg for many years and was ecstatic when I saw it here.  Despite the warning the dvd's play find in my computer (althought it is an older model so that might have something to do with it.)  I always felt that the show was cancelled too soon (like several others of the time) and despite the 16 episode run, watching it was one of my favorite weekend memories.  I think what killed it was the move to sunday mornings as Sunday sporting event tended to preempt or even cancel showings of various shows (which is why, I think, they stopped showing such things on Sundays altogether in the late 70's early 80's).  The quality of the recording was flawless and I will admit that I had forgotten the show was narrated by Buergos Meredith (Penguin from Batman fame)  There are a number of saturday morning shows that I hope follow this one.  So let me just end this with a HUGE thank you for bringing this show, and some very fond memories back.",1380499200,,984,4.4088397790055245
8550203,5,B00ADRYG78,Just as I remembered it when I was little.  They don't make shows like this now days.  Children learned on Saturday Mornings in the 1970s.,1379894400,,138,4.48
8550204,5,B00ADRYG78,"This was really a groundbreaking series when it came out in the mid-1970's on Saturdays.  Not the typical childish Saturday morning cartoon fare, but a serious and totally believable portrayal of a pre-historic clan struggling to survive.  The guy who played Korg was fantastic, the others were not very good!",1376438400,3,309,5.16
8550205,5,B00ADRYG78,"Korg 70,000 bc did what few tv programs are able to do. It showed us something that had not been seen before. The budget was low and the production values suffer against comparison, but it was honest and simple and made you want to know more about our prehistory.",1368576000,3,263,4.387755102040816
8550206,5,B00ADRYG78,...it was really fun to get re-introduced to it! Watching the episodes brought back some wonderful 70s era Saturday-morning memories.,1364428800,,133,5.7
8550207,4,B00ADRYG78,"Great transfers, although one of the episodes seemed to skip in places. Probably just a manufacturing flaw, the DVD set was sealed. Otherwise all was tip top. Great show, those neanderthals were really mofugly!",1361577600,,210,5.205882352941177
