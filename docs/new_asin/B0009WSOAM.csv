8068710,4,B0009WSOAM,"I've just barely gotten into this DVD, and think it'll be helpful, but was hoping for something a little more on bluegrass flatpicking and knowing the scales so that I could take breaks moving up the neck.  Instead this DVD seems to be more about making up a break by playing notes within the chord patterns.  While this is also a helpful technique that I can use and learn better, I would like to find a DVD that is more of a bluegrass technique and style for flat picking. I also wish that this DVD had more standard bluegrass tunes to work on.  Wabash Cannonball and Peach Picking Time in Georgia aren't generally tunes that get called in a bluegrass jam circle.  All in all I think the DVD will be helpful though.",1283731200,5,717,4.368421052631579
8068711,5,B0009WSOAM,"This product is for those looking to take solos on bluegrass songs in which a singer is being accompanied. It is not aimed at purely instrumental pieces. Steve emphasizes the melody of the songs in his solos and demonstrates licks, cross picking, and entire solos.",1203552000,4,264,4.888888888888889
