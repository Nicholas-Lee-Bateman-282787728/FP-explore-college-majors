2301959,1,B0009NCPMY,"This is nothing sort of awful. The director and editor tried to be unique and suspenseful and they failed. The storyline was
predictable. I kept waiting for it to get better because of the reviews. Save yourself, don't bother with this terrible acted and written
movie.",1459641600,,269,4.869565217391305

2301961,2,B0009NCPMY,really goof noir plot ruined by gross out late last century puerile sex and violence. Glad Gen Xers are making neo-noirs more like the classic noirs with subtlety and artistic merit.,1457222400,,182,4.903225806451613
2301962,3,B0009NCPMY,It is worth watching it only for the pleasure of looking at Madchen Amick,1455580800,,73,4.285714285714286

2301972,3,B0009NCPMY,"The Canadian-made thriller, THE LIST would be merely pedestrian if the plot wasn't so darned confusing-- nebulous and fleeting characters are as frequent as the number of times dialogue turns hokey. This late-career starring role for Ryan O'Neal is definitely not a resume topper. Veteran character actor Ben Gazzara as a D.A. is wasted in support.

SYNOPSIS--
A high-end call girl (Amick) arranges a false arrest as an opportunity to make public her list of prominent clients. When she submits her catalog of attorneys, judges and politicians in court, the presiding magistrate (O'Neal) considers sealing the evidence to protect his many friends who will be incriminated if the list is published.

A case-related murder is committed; the judge and prostitute are threatened. Detectives believe the perpetrator is someone on the list, but they're ordered to cease investigating. One of them chooses to continue, with the girl's assistance. To do so they must endanger their own lives.

2301973,2,B0009NCPMY,"Ok so as a fan of thrillers and dramas I thought id check out The List. Seemed like it'd be interesting...WRONG! Madchen Amick of course was wonderful as she always is and Ryan O'Neal was great too but my god this movie did them no justice. Ok so we have judges and lawyers and politicians all customers of this elite call girl played by the gorgeous and talented Madchen Amick and once she let it be known she's going to blackmail all her clients, instead of simply killing her, those same clients go after everyone but her. Her lawyer, another judge who seemingly is the only person in that city of power who hasn't slept with her, a cop who is trying to protect her but they don't try to kill her...Well for the majority of the film. Ryan O'Neal is that judge *who has the hookers list of clients aka the blackmail list* who stands by his morals and is a man of such virtue that he would risk letting the hooker expose his colleagues than stand in the way of justice. The beginning scene and the last two scenes were the best parts about the film. The ending was great I will say that and I didn't see it coming but this plot needed so much work. Its like I can see where the writers were going but failure to get there and failure to make it interesting in the least bit. I mean after a couple Madchen and Ryan O'Neal scenes I was ready to call it quits. The actors were amazing but the plot was horrible. Rent...Dont buy",1355529600,,1425,4.242647058823529
2301974,1,B0009NCPMY,"I bought this because I want to see Madchen. The story is awful.
It's not about the actor Ryan ONeil or Madchen Amick - they're okay.
The story is not worth $1.00",1341014400,,162,4.09375

2301976,4,B0009NCPMY,"I rented this on the offchance that Ryan O'neal was in it, and it turned out to be better than I expected. It's a small movie that only takes place in a few settings, but you can tell that all the actors and production personnel were doing their absolute best to make it stand out. The ending was something not expected, which was a pleasant surprise. Madchen Amick is gorgeous, just stunning to look at, and she was my favorite part of the film.

8063493,2,B0009NCPMY,The central theme is implausible. The depiction of judicial and litigant behavior is absurd. The end is as cynical as can be.,1484524800,,125,4.7272727272727275
