3916477,3,B002EAYE4W,"Ann-Margret sparkles in this slight sex farce from the late Sixties, treading her own unique path in territory best-owned by the likes of Doris Day and Debbie Reynolds.  Whilst it hasn't dated especially well, 1966's MADE IN PARIS is an enjoyable title for Ann-Margret fans...and those who appreciate their romantic comedies wrapped up in lush couture fashion.

What's MADE IN PARIS?  Ann-Margret is, for one!  She plays Maggie Scott, a young woman who rises up from within the ranks of department store Barclay & Ames to become the assistant fashion-buyer, when Irene Chase (Edie Adams) unexpectedly jaunts off to get married.  Almost immediately, Maggie is bundled onto a plane to Paris, armed with invites to all the major fashion shows.  Barclay & Ames has always prided itself on a particularly close working relationship with famous French fashion designer Marc Fontaine (Louis Jourdan), but when Maggie learns precisely ""how"" close, the battle-lines are drawn.  You see, Maggie's a *very* good girl.  But love flows like champagne in a place like Paris, and it's not long until she's caught up in the spell.

Mainly noteworthy for it's outrageous Sixties fashions, designed by longtime MGM costumier Helen Rose (a favourite amongst Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Powell), MADE IN PARIS is a breezy way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  Ann-Margret is adorable in the lead, and the guys surrounding her (Louis Jourdan, Richard Crenna and Chad Everett) are all solid in their support.  Edie Adams dazzles in her brief bit as Maggie's superior.

This DVD-R from the Warner Archive offers a nice ""scope"" print, probably comparable to the one normally seen on TCM.  There's minimal damage evident (mostly compression and strobing issues); the soundtrack volume shifts in certain reels.  Extras are limited to the trailer plus a promo for the Warner Archive programme.",1303171200,3,1862,5.183946488294314

3916479,4,B002EAYE4W,"This is one of Ann-Margrets funniest movies she did, Made in Paris is classic mid 60s comedy. The best thing I noticed about this dvd as well is that it was all shot in wide angle so you saw much more of the movie than you did when they showed it on the TCM channel which they only ever showed in full screen so you lost quite a bit of the cinematic scope of the movie. Ann-Margret at this time is at the height of her beauty and the costumes they have her wear in this movie compliment her stunning figure. One draw back although is I wished that Warner Brothers had put the featurette of Made in Paris on the dvd which show case Ann-Margret wearing the costumes in a screen test that was narrated by the late Richard Crenna who played Herb Stone in the movie. Overall Ann-Margret who played the young and naieve Maggie Scott Assistant fashion buyer for Barclay Ames in the film played it right to the tea, her dance sequences are always fantastic to watch as she does so in one of the nightclub scenes where she really gets her groove on. For the true Ann-Margret fan this is a must have movie to have in your collection.",1294185600,15,1123,4.252336448598131

3916482,3,B002EAYE4W,"This is Ann-Margret applying her sex-kitten routine to what basically could have been a script for a Doris-Day picture. It's a slick vehicle that sadly doesn't give her enough musical moments to make it special. It's no secret to any of Ann-Margret's real fans that her unique talents were best showcased on Vegas stages, and in the marvelous, studio sessions she did in the 60's for RCA. Her film career mostly consisted of being a fashion-plate ingenue doing a rather tepid Marilyn-Monroe imitation - and MADE IN PARIS is a prime example of that.
The print used for this WARNER ARCHIVE dvd-r comes across very much like the original theatrical presentations - anamorphic scope with pleasing, saturated Metrocolor. The original monaural soundtrack requires cinema EQ and is presented in 2 tracks for Dolby Pro-Logic playback.",1275782400,10,826,5.125925925925926
3916483,5,B002EAYE4W,"Made In Paris is a romantic comedy that seems custom made for Ann-Margret. The film was released on February 9, 1966 by MGM. This colorful, gorgeously filmed movie features a simple story, but really showcases Ann-Margret's perfect figure in beautiful clothes against beautiful Paris and New York City in the sixties.

Ann-Margret plays Maggie Scott, an Assistant Fashion Buyer for Barclay Ames, a New York Department Store. Her boss, the store's Fashion Buyer is Irene Chase played by the lovely Edie Adams. Irene is getting married and must send Maggie in her place, to beautiful Paris, to purchase the gorgeous Fontaine gowns that Barclay Ames carries exclusively in their New York store. The store's owner's son is Ted Barclay played by Chad Everett, who definitely has a romantic interest in Maggie. Ted calls his friend in Paris, Herb Stone played by Richard Crenna, to ask him to keep an eye on Maggie, as he has heard of Marc Fontaine's (Marc Fontaine, the Parisienne Coutier is played by Louis Jourdan) reputation as a suave womanizer. When Maggie arrives in Paris, Marc Fontaine eventually takes a romantic interest in her, as does Ted's friend Herb Stone, although Herb's interest seems to be just for a night. The 3 men don't have much personality, like James Garner or Rod Taylor have in Doris Day's romantic comedies, but perhaps they pale in comparison, being up against Ann-Margret's abundance of energy in her acting and dancing. Besides a few dance numbers in night clubs, Ann-Margret has a singing scene with Reta Shaw where they sing, You Gotta See Your Mama Every Night, Or You Can't See Your Mama At All. Count Basie And His Octet provide some great music. Also included is the original theatrical trailer, which was a real surprise, as the majority of the WB Archive Collection movies just have the movie with no extras.

This is a typical sixties romantic comedy, the plot and storyline are simple, but a gorgeous 24 year old Ann-Margret steals every scene. The film has the most beautiful clothes, apartments and scenery, which are great eye candy for viewing. This is a rarely found movie and is definitely worth buying if you like sixties romantic comedies, but until Amazon's price comes down, you can find this movie on the Warner Brothers Archive Collection website for $17.99 plus shipping.",1271548800,32,2321,4.9335038363171355

The burning questions are who will she pick and will she maintain her virtue in the process.  If you don't know the answers then you haven't seen enough of these kind of flicks.

3916488,2,B002EAYE4W,"Apparently no one else who has reviewed this movie was bothered by the poor quality of the video. I still have a lot of DVDs that I collected before Blu-Ray arrived, and I still occasionally watch them, so I know what good DVDs look like, and what a typical DVD looks like. When you consider that any movie shot on regular 35mm film has vastly greater detail that what DVD is capable of, there isn't any good reason why any DVD should be of any less quality than the format allows. The DVD-R disc used for this title is not to blame; the capacity is the same as with any other DVD. The black bars that had to be recorded would have had affected the quality some, but not enough to explain the unusually poor quality of this DVD. When a DVD is recorded in anamorphic format, the pixel array is still 16x9 for every frame, but a bit on the disc informs the player to stretch it horizontally so that when played, it will be 16x9 rather than 4x3. That avoids recording black bars if the movie is actually 16x9, but this movie is wider still, so black bars are still recorded on the disc. However, the MPEG recording format is actually pretty effective at not wasting bandwidth (or storage capacity) on parts of the picture that don't change from one frame to the next, especially so in the case of regions of the picture that are uniform spatially. Point is that the need to record the black bars probably is not the explanation for the soft picture. I watched it on TCM just recently, which is what prompted me to buy it. I like Ann-Margaret. So I bought it, but it was a waste of money. I'll never try to watch it again.",1438732800,,1618,4.308196721311475

3916490,3,B002EAYE4W,"Made In Paris(1966) is a film that was made to specifically showcase the beauty of Ann Margaret, Paris, and the chic outfits that Ann displays so well. The main problem is that the script and story are rather bland and add little to the film, itself. Ann plays an assistant buyer in New York who is promoted to a main buyer for a large department store in New York City. After the rather unexpected and sudden promotion, she finds herself unexpectedly sent to the City of Light for the fashion shows. As would be expected, Ann is very beautiful with her fine figure and pretty face, and she looks quite ravishing in her various outfits. The film is quite typical of the 60's romantic comedies of the time, but there is really nothing that really lifts it above the typical romantic comedies of the 60's. Paris is featured in all of it's 60's beauty, as well as some very good scenery all around. There is some light comedy that is caused by some mistaken identity early on, and Ann does display some excellent dance moves in a couple of scenes, but none can really compare with her dancing in her earlier films such as Bye Bye Birdie(1963), and especially her moves with Elvis Presley in Viva Las Vegas(1964). Louis Jourdan is good as a Frenchman who ends up falling for Ann. The cast also features some decent acting by Richard Crenna, Chad Everett, and Edie Adams. As stated earlier style is simply bogged down by the lack of substance to the story. The film flows down like a nice glass of champagne, but leaves you somewhat thirsty for more. One big plus is the widescreen presentation that allows you to take in the beauty of Paris, France, during the 60's, as well as Ann, herself. I really wanted to like this film more but other than eye candy, there is simply not enough to raise it above so many other romantic comedies of this period. The DVD transfer is excellent, and the film is presented in widescreen, 16x9, 2.4:1. If you are a diehard Ann Margaret fanatic, I would bump the film up to 4 stars. Recommended for fans of fluffy, 60's romantic comedies with much style but little substance. The running time of the film is 103 minutes, and the colors of the print are pristine.

3916505,2,B002EAYE4W,"Beautiful, young Maggie Scott (Ann-Margret, 24 years old at the time of this film) is an assistant fashion buyer for a huge, New York City department store, Barclay Ames. She worked her way up to the position, starting as a model, and the owner's handsome son, Ted Barclay (Chad Everett, a handsome 29-year-old back then), has recently been wining and dining her in hopes of becoming Maggie's lover. (We learn later in the film that he has had over 1300 lovers which, at his relatively young age, comes out to at least two or three new lovers on average every week for years!) Maggie is slinky and seductive in her behavior, but a determined virgin who has the overriding ambition of every heroine of a romantic comedy from the 1950's and 1960's (this is 1966)--to get married. Maggie wants a home in the suburbs, children, a station wagon and two sheep dogs and, of course, a husband who can provide her with those things. Maggie, as is the case with every Hollywood-created young woman of her era, is clear on the fact that no man will ""buy the cow if he can get the milk for free.""

Maggie's immediate boss, Irene Chase (Edie Adams), has been the store's fashion buyer for a number of years, but she gets a very desirable marriage proposal from a banker and drops her job like the proverbial hot potato to elope with him. Unfortunately, Irene was on the verge of departing for her annual pilgrimage to Paris for the spring fashion shows. So impressed is Ted Barclay with Maggie's morals (though what that has to do with her work ethic is never explained), he strongly recommends her to his father, Roger Barclay (John McGiver), who reluctantly, out of desperation, appoints Maggie as Irene's replacement.

With only minutes to spare before joining her impatient bridegroom to train Maggie in her new duties, Irene fails to warn Maggie that she has been carrying on a torrid affair with Marc Fontaine (Louis Jourdan), a gorgeous, womanizing fashion designer, who keeps clothing and personal effects at the lush apartment maintained by the Barclay Ames store in Paris, and who has essentially moved in with Irene every time she has been in Paris on her annual fashion-buying trips.

Having failed to seduce Maggie, Ted wants to make sure no one else does, and he pleads with a friend of his, a journalist living in Paris named Herb Stone (Richard Crenna), to watch out for Maggie and keep her out of trouble, especially from Marc Fontaine. Too bad for Ted--and Maggie--that the man nominated to protect her is even more of a wolf than Fontaine.

Ann-Margret was already a big star at a very young age when this movie was made after co-starring with Elvis in the hit movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viva-Las-Vegas/dp/B003Y5YLXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viva Las Vegas</a>, two years before. She is the classic ""triple threat,"" able to sing, dance and act, and even though huge, flashy musicals were well on their way out by 1960, and her only truly big chance to show off her dancing and singing was in the Elvis movie, she had the opportunity to sing a little in her first movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocketful-of-Miracles/dp/B001EYLYF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocketful of Miracles</a>&nbsp;in 1961, and quite a bit more in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bye-Bye-Birdie/dp/B001G5RFHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bye Bye Birdie</a>&nbsp;in 1963, which is an actual musical. Made in Paris is not a musical, but apparently its producers decided to give her a chance to display her singing and dancing one more time in this film anyway. For my personal tastes, because this is not a musical, it was rather jarring to watch her leap into a full dance-production number in a Paris night club and launch into a duet with Louis Jourdan. However, I will admit that her song and semi-dance number with talented character actress Reta Shaw in a bar was a bit more believably motivated, since Shaw's character is an actual, professional singer in the movie, and Maggie was drunk at the time that she boisterously joined Shaw in song. And of course, any fan of Ann-Margret who enjoys her dancing will appreciate her dancing in this movie. In addition, it is a pleasure to see Count Basie And His Octet play some terrific music.

Note that this DVD also includes the sole extra of the original theatrical trailer.

Below are some ***SPOILERS*** as I go into further reasons why I gave this movie only two stars:

A few days before I watched this movie, I viewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ambassador-s-Daughter/dp/B000BVM1YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ambassador's Daughter</a>&nbsp;with Olivia de Havilland, which was set in Paris in 1956, ten years before this movie, and I had also recently seen for the umpteenth time the Doris Day romantic comedy from 1959,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pillow-Talk/dp/B002DJVLAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pillow Talk</a>. Viewed so closely together, it is fascinating to see the evolution in a few short years of the theme of husband-hunting female protagonists so patronizingly portrayed in Hollywood in the 1950's and early to mid-1960's. In each case, the virgin heroine is assiduously protecting her virtue with a goal of marriage, but the movement toward the popular sex farces of the 1960's had barely begun in TAD, was mildly evident in PT, and in full swing in this movie. In fact, the title itself is a blunt, almost crude double entendre, ""made"" being a play on words of fashion made/created in Paris, and the attempts of three men in Maggie's life to ""make"" her, or have sleazy, uncommitted, user sex with her.

In the 1956 movie, the hero mistakenly comes to believe that the heroine is the mistress of a much older man, and assumes that the heroine, whom he had previously assumed was the virginal woman that she actually is, is in fact a ""bad girl."" In the 1959 movie, the hero takes it as a challenge to seduce the virginal heroine and, of course, does not succeed. In this film, the script and the direction of Maggie is all over the map. Her character is presented as the sterotypical, misogynist version of a ""tease."" Maggie uses seductive wiles on no less than three men, and all of them fall for her, clearly wanting to have sex with her, and Maggie alternates between being enraged at them daring to express that desire (very discreetly by today's standards), and deciding that she wants to try and be a ""bad girl"" after all. I found her character, as portrayed, extremely unsympathetic, and the men were all one-dimensional womanizers. The character played by Richard Crenna was the most obnoxious, because it presented a perpetual Hollywood cliche of that era, a man only marginally attractive without either money or power to entice a young, gorgeous woman, having an endless supply of women ready and eager at a moment's notice to have one-night stands with him whenever he gave them a last-minute call.

Extreme drunkenness plays part in the climax of the story and Maggie's ultimate decision as to which of her three lusty swains will provide her with the picket fence, dogs and station wagon. It is almost impossible, in any era, to watch an adult comedy without at least one scene involving drunkeness, which I always find to be a really easy, lowest-denominator source of slapstick humor.

If you are a huge fan of Ann-Margret, and you don't mind stupid, drunken behavior, multiple romantic interests, and extreme sexism, you might enjoy this film. I think that Ann-Margret does as much as anyone could with subpar material, and Louis Jourdan, who is an outstanding comic actor, gives a terrific performance with far more depth than such a tawdry part could be expected to deliver.",1391731200,,7892,5.202202989771833

3916509,1,B002EAYE4W,"""Made in Paris"" huh?....What a gyp! This movie never gets ""off-the-ground"", ...much less anywhere off the soundstage at MGM!

Paris being my very favourite city, I will sit through just about anything with Paris in the title, or purports to be about that particular city.
(Yes, even the otherwise supremely irritating Woody Allen's offering!)
I bought this pathetic offering mainly due to the reviews here, but have to say I was supremely disappointed.
It most definitely is NOT ""made in Paris""!
It never even gets out of the studio in Hollywood USA!

There are three very quick clips from stock footage of ""The City of Light"", and one appallingly stagey recreation of what is supposed to be Quai de la Tournelle, looking back at the rear of Notre Dame and Pont de l'Archeveche.
Now this might JUST pass if this was a stage play set in a theatre, but as a film purporting to be in Paris it wouldn't fool even a vision impaired Eskimo!

Every other scene is shot in interiors that some set designer has over-worked to try and look French, but in truth look more like some American idea of what French rooms might look like,... if your decorator was Liberace that is!

This travesty apart, the movie is nothing more than heterosexuality at it's most vapid!
There's a very long intro without dialogue which shows Ann-Margaret's character to be the type of girl who is quite willing to allow men to spend a great deal of money and time on her, but she certainly doesn't ""put-out"" at the evenings end.
Indeed, she's prepared to assault anyone who tries with very heavy ornaments applied to the head!
There's a most appropriate two-word term for her in the current vernacular, but I'm sure that Amazon would not like me to type it here!

Anyway, the whole story is basically about her choosing whom to give her virginity to, ....the work colleague who could be Mr. Nice Guy with her manipulation, the suave French fashion designer (a hetero one it seems, there are a few subtle digs at those who are not here), ...or the aging rou who seems to have a procession of women, ...but looses his desire when he gets his chance, and Ann-Margaret has passed-out at last!
It's really just fatuous rubbish from start to finish!

Then there's the problem with this movie being undecided as to what it really wants to be.
Starts out as a ""straight"" movie, ...obeying the conventions of ""reality"", ...then suddenly when we get to the scene under the bridge mentioned above, Ann-Margaret breaks into song with Louis Jordan, ...complete with an off-stage full orchestra accompaniment!
Ann-Margaret can barely carry a tune at best of times, but Louis Jordan tries to get away with a semi-spoken technique that is neither musical or entertaining. More leering in truth, along the lines of a Maurice Chevalier.
He makes another pass, only to get his car stolen by Ms. A-M, ....who has literally STALKED him all evening through about four dives all purporting to be Parisian, but looking more like some leftover sets from other movies at MGM.

Then there's the dance bits.
Suddenly in a movie that starts off as ""reality"", Ms A-M Leaps to her feet and dances several supposedly ""impromptu"" routines with four or so male backing dancers, all in rehearsed synchronised moves! If you watch closely, it's the very same blokes in all the different clubs where she dances, ...just in different costumes.

Now the ""musical"" is a genre I'm almost but not totally allergic to, but I do want to be forewarned if that is the brand of highly unrealistic entertainment I'm about to watch.
(Allows me to dose up on insulin in readiness!)
This movie tries to sneak those incredibly saccharine super-rehearsed moments up on the unsuspecting viewer, ..and for me that was NOT an enjoyable experience.

You rapidly lose interest in the predictable heterosexual permutations, .....as you know exactly who the vapid A-M will end up with, (no real prize in my opinion).....and her acting abilities are far too perfunctory to hold any interest.
In short, you just don't care.
The ""Doris Day"" last scene complete with English sheepdogs is totally risible, ....if you're not heaving over the edge of your sofa, or dozed off, which is the better of options!
You can't even watch this hetero-dross for the locations. This movie is SO ""land-locked"" on a sound stage as to be a live theatre piece.

Calling this weak offering ""Made in Paris"" was surely the ultimate irony?
One star, ..and that's only because Amazon doesn't have the facilities to award zero, but I suppose someone's ability to locate those Paris clips from the public film banks deserves some recognition.
Transfer this one to old celluloid inflammable stock immediately!",1369872000,,4685,4.830423940149626

Both pretty hunky guys in their own fashion (fashion is the 'word' for this flick.) Doris Day style plot where nobody really gets hurt (much) and there's always that perfect happy ending.

Come to think of it, most of those fashions are pretty timeless and could be proudly worn today. (Minus the politically incorrect animal pelts of course.) Totally enjoyable chick flick.",1359244800,5,1150,5.068783068783069

3916512,4,B002EAYE4W,"This rarely found movie has been remastered and is pleasing in both sound and picture. It is a 1966 romantic comedy and is typical of that time in that it has a simple plot and storyline. But the wow factor is Ann-Margret. In her gorgeous clothes she steals the scenes in Paris and New York with her presence, surrounded by men whose aim it is is to be noticed by her ! One of these men is the very handsome Chad Everett. Great eye candy ! It's fun, it's gorgeous, chic and sexy. A must have for the Ann-Margret fans.",1353542400,5,517,4.18
3916513,5,B002EAYE4W,"Warner Archive's beautiful transfer on 1966's M-G-M Ann-Margret fun-fest ""Made in Paris"" will not be available forever as it is one of their made on demand titles.  I was given a DVD of it made from Turner Classic Movies which tended to pixelate and I originally hoped it would suffice.  But as Warner Archive catalog grows, and money allowing, I purchased several movies from them that I already had in my collection in what may be poorer quality presentations.  The Warner Archive edition is stunningly beautiful and well worth the price you pay for it.  Ann-Margret made ten films from 1964 to 1966 after her triumphal success in ""Bye Bye Birdie"" up to and including ""Murderer's Row"" a Matt Helm spy film she did and it is surprising how few of them are available on DVD or even VHS.  ""Made in Paris"" was directed by Boris Sagal, who besides directing Elvis's ""Girl Happy"" later directed the cult classic ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston.  ""Made in Paris"" has a great cast including Chad Everett, Edie Adams, Louis Jordan and Richard Crenna and they obviously spent a lot on it, some sets achingly beautiful in a kind of deja vu to when they made these films regularly in Metrocolor.  Knowing the film will remain in my collection to watch so gloriously every time I decide to watch it is a kind of insurance for the future I wouldn't want to live without.  DVD includes a trailer.  Worth it.",1320710400,6,1399,4.631578947368421
