I'm struggling to find something positive about it, but the fact is, it is the lowest quality biographical documentary I've ever seen. In fact, I'm amazed at the lack of substance this video has. It is about 10% actual footage/photos of the subject, and 90% non-relevant (filler) scenery. It suffers factually due to an obvious lack of research, especially surprising because of the great amount of material/photos that exists on Capote. This video is a disgrace to one of America's great writers. Buy the A & E Biography of Capote, it is first rate (but Too short!)",1199836800,5,614,4.913461538461538
8120706,3,B000FC2HNG,"If you're looking for a documentary on the life of Truman Capote, you have two choices:

* Truman Capote, A&E DVD Archives (2005) [ASIN: B0009HMTFS]; and

* Great Writers: Truman Capote (2000) [ASIN: B000FC2HNG]

Neither one is inexpensive, so I would have liked a review saying which one is better. As it turned out, I ended up buying and watching both. Although both programs are of roughly the same length, the differences are significant.

The Arts & Entertainment (A & E) version is clearly better. It has more information, photographs, film footage, and interesting interviews than the Great Writers version, which seems to be trying to make some sort of artistic statement of its own - lots of pictures of grass waving in the wind, country roads, etc., none of which are terribly relevant.

You will be better off buying the A & E program.",1150416000,16,846,4.8068965517241375
