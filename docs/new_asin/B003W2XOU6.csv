Although her part is crucial and she brings everything to the role that one would expect.. I would suggest that her appearance and abilities were diminished and wasted.  If you are an indie fan and you like sitting through droll dialogue... go for it;  This Movie may be for you.  I tend to Judge movies for their entertainment value and in that regard  I would have to five Passenger Side a Failing Grade.
For example..  seven or eight minutes were given to a Transvestite Hooker jumping into the car with the main character.  After sharing a coffee and bantering about how she likes it straight with cream..  She proceeds to tell him he can just watch.  He/She masturbates and  tells him a girl has to work and charges him $ 40.00..  To which he responds that it was well worth it.  Maybe so for Indie Fans.  NOT ME.",1421971200,,972,4.298342541436464
8407239,2,B003W2XOU6,"Some describe it, positively, as a sleeper with sarcasm. Standard in-car camera and nearby vehicle camera filming two brothers as they drive around L.A. in their beater BMW. It's basically a film that is 90% the following: freeway driving; desert driving; palm lined street driving with typical L.A. suburban adobe box houses as backdrop; trashy street driving with low rent small business liquor, car wash, stop 'n shop and fast food stores with appropriate poorly done graffiti; lots of shots of L.A. street advertising. To awaken from that flow are shots of insects, desert plants and a few pointless brief encounters with a transgender; a drunk; Mexicans clearing cacti; mechanics and dealers all of whom, once their one minute of fame is over, could have been edited out and no one would notice. As is customary in films where you might have to keep a plot or visually sedated audience engaged (awake) the production crew will spice it up with their personal favorite and cheap underground/indie garage songs (25 in this case).

Oh, storyline! One brother is driving the other around to help him locate his girlfriend. At the end is a twist (not out of cleverness or intelligent story design but just in withholding information) but at that point - who cares.

Positives: Acting was spontaneous-like, natural, comfortable just like two guys hanging out. Didn't seem overly scripted, memorized or read the teleprompter acting. A few comeback tete-a-tete lines were witty.",1329177600,6,1475,5.090909090909091

8407241,5,B003W2XOU6,"This is an awesome film that has a little bit of everything: pondering about life, estranged brothers, a mystery, a girl, a porn shoot... Very indie.",1299628800,,149,4.769230769230769
