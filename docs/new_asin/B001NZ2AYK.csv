8328475,3,B001NZ2AYK,I think I sold this or gave this to the Goodwill after watching it just enough to see the Medusa portion.  It's just not the same anymore with these kinds of movies.  The quality is so different from modern movies.,1456358400,,214,4.325
8328476,5,B001NZ2AYK,"The monster in this movie were developed by Carlo Rambaldi, who went on to working on such Hollywood hits as Alien and E.T.! This is one of the best in the sword and sandal series. A Must!",1238803200,4,188,4.108108108108108
8328477,5,B001NZ2AYK,"The modern sword and sandal movies like 300 and Gladiator owe their start to the early Hercules movies. This is one the best, featuring Richard Harrison as one of the best looking sons of Hercules. There are 2 monsters in this one as well, and they were designed by Carlo Rambaldi, who would later go on to create special effects for some of Hollywood's biggest mobvies, including -Alien- and -E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial- ! The plot is based on the classic Greek myth about Perseus and the Medusa, a monster with snakes for hair. One look at Medusa's face turns men to stone. It's a fun movie with action, romance, swords, and a dragon!",1229644800,4,637,4.646017699115045
