8093504,5,B000BWHI1G,I think Greg Evigan is great in this dvds.  The future isn't as wonderful as we have things today.  Great,1381363200,,105,4.2
8093505,5,B000BWHI1G,I got Tec War through Amazon. It is SF and very good. I enjoyed watching the series again. Arrived on time and new condition.,1312329600,,125,4.25
8093506,4,B000BWHI1G,"It's been awhile since I saw this show, but like most of you, I thought it was cool and an original concept at the time. Since it's marked as Season 1, I don't expect the movies to be on it. Tekwar, Teklords, Teklab, & TekJustice were the TV movies based on the books and were released before there ever was a series. I don't know why some TV show sites list them as episodes. They do the same thing with Nick Knight and Forever Knight.

I haven't bought this set yet. I was wondering if anyone could give me an accurate running time or list of episodes offered in this set. Thanks in advance.",1310169600,,593,4.201754385964913
8093507,5,B000BWHI1G,It's been ages since I've seen Tek War.  I still have the movies on VHS. Von Flores is great as usual.,1302652800,,102,3.857142857142857
8093508,2,B000BWHI1G,This series was nothing to rave about. I think I was most excited about seeing the actress who played Andromeda. She was ina  few of the episodes briefly. I didn't quite agree with a lot of the other reviewers about the plots being all that interesting. I enjoyed this only because i enjoy science fiction. I would recommend buying it only if you can find it under $30 somewhere.,1202342400,4,379,4.492753623188406
8093509,5,B000BWHI1G,"I am glad I found the series of Tekwar as I was also a fan of the show when it originally aired. I currently already own the four movies: TekWar:Tekwar, TekWar:TekJustice, Tekwar:TekLabs and Tekwar:TekLords all on their VHS original cassettes which I bought new as soon as they became available. I must have forgotten about the series otherwise I know I would have bought these also. I am please to say that based on Richard Bards review I agree totally with his remarks and comments about the series, each episode still holds up today both in story line and effects, the DVD quality is also excellent and has been transferred to DVD with no loss of picture or audio and whilst the menus are basic with no chaptering they are very functional and work well. I would love to see the original movies released in DVD format so I can obtain these on a more versatile and longer lasting media format.

I think the only fragile thing about my box set when it arrived with me was the plastic DVD cases themselves -grin- most have suffered some very minor cosmetic damage but the DVDs themselves are perfect, were well protected in transit (I live in the UK) and in all honesty the cases can be easily replaced therefore I have no complaints. Unlike Richard I have removed all the plastic from the packaging and find it easy to slip the DVDs cases out the cardboard sleeve via the bottom or top of the out cover, although I can see his suggestion is a good one for those who would find them sliding out the base a nuisance. If you are interested in trying to get the first four movies on DVD, there is a web site that allows you to vote for shows to be transferred onto DVD, I have contacted them and they advised me that you have to vote for the ""Series"" of the show, if enough votes are received there is always a slim chance that the license holders may make the whole set of films/series available, although there are no guarantees on this but do check out the tvshowsondvd web site to register your vote.

Definately a show to watch, and it would be nice to see it make a come back even in repeat TV airings as I am sure it would generate some new fans and maybe the DVD sales would appear :)",1144368000,21,2188,4.34718826405868
8093510,5,B000BWHI1G,"I imported this set from Canada to the US several months ago as I watched the series back when it was on USA Network in the mid 90's and loved it.  The plot is overally very original from episode to episode.  There's always some kind of twist to the stories rather than over obvious clues that ruin many scifi shows for me.  Also though each story is completed by the end of the 40'something minutes... there's actually some strong continuity of events through this whole season of the show.  The special effects still hold up well today which is a rarity for many older scifi shows.  They were really pushing the envelope back when this was made and though the series didn't last... it remains very watchable without seeming ""comedic"" due to poor quality work.

As for this set, while it's called ""The Complete First Season"" it is infact the only season of the show that aired.  All 18 episodes are contained in this set.  The TV movies that came before the series are not and currently still remain not available on DVD.

I think most people that will want to buy this might be fans of William Shatner, Greg Evigan, or some of the other actors in the show.  This pretty much is the start of Lexa Doig (Andromeda, Stargate SG-1), Torri Higginson (Stargate Atlantis), and other current scifi actors careers.

The DVD set is actually not as fragile as mentioned.  Each disc is put in it's own standard DVD box with it's own box art... and those 5 boxes are then wrapped with a basic piece of cardboard.  So there's no top or bottom to the cardboard box.  Ultimately I just cut the top plastic off the package and left the rest of the plastic on it so the regular dvd boxes didn't slide out the bottom... but not everyone thinks of that so you may see complaints.  The quality of the transfer is actually pretty high.  I had no problems at all with it, unlike some older shows where an episode may end up grainy or something.  The only really major negative I could say about this set is there are absolutely no extras and the menu system looks like something someone cooked up on their home PC without any training or history of making dvd menus.  Luckily though the show looks and plays well... and that's really what matters.

I don't think there are many TekWar fans out there.  I'm one of the few.  So I figured maybe someone might want a review on this.  If you like mid 90's scifi, you like good stories that keep you guessing, you like earth based scifi, and you have some spare cash go ahead and get the set.  If you loved the show when it premired on USA Network.. then rest assured it does indeed stand the test of time.",1133913600,78,2629,4.408713692946058
