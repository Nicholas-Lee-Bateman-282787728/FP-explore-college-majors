Highly recommended. My two favorite numbers are The Apple Doesn't Fall Far From the Tree and New York, New York. I will update this when I view the bonus songs.",1451347200,9,329,4.0

7456159,5,B01648P5HY,Kander & Ebb write top notch music.  Real strong voices in the cast.  Thanks  C. fogg,1462406400,2,85,4.1875
7456160,3,B01648P5HY,I guess it's just kind of sad that Liza Minnelli was not able to participate in this. Kander and Ebb created her.,1458432000,,113,4.181818181818182
7456161,2,B01648P5HY,THERE IS A SPOT WHERE THE DVD STOPS AND RESTARTS-VERY ANNOYING,1457308800,,62,4.7272727272727275

7456163,5,B01648P5HY,"A wonderful collection of great Kander and Ebb songs performed by a ridiculously talented group of performers. The chemistry between the cast is palpable. It is clear that they were so thrilled to get the chance to film this show. (For those of you that don't know, 5 of the 6 performers did the full-length version of this show together in 2009.)

In addition to what played on PBS, this DVD's bonus features includes some of my favorite moments of this show -- such as the unbelievable ""The Money Tree/Maybe This Time"" duet/""belt off"" by Julia Murney and Heidi Blickenstaff.",1454284800,15,576,4.76
7456164,5,B01648P5HY,"Its sort of a Side by Side by Sondheim for Kander & Ebb, with Kate Baldwin, Heidi Blickenstaff, James Clow, Norm Lewis, Julia Murney, and Matthew Scott. The title comes from the Steel Pier song ""First You Dream. This is an excellent PBS production, and a wonderful introduction to Kander & Ebb. Those who are familiar with their work won't find any rare songs or long-forgotten jems; however, the singer/actors are first rate and the arrangements are upbeat.",1452470400,18,458,4.884615384615385
8735571,5,B01648P5HY,"Great video- I actually saw this revue when when it was at Signature Theater in Arlington VA a few years ago and really enjoyed it then.  This is a great version of it - strong vocals, full orchestra, and well staged.  Highly recommended!",1523664000,,238,4.511627906976744
8735572,5,B01648P5HY,"Love this collection and ensemble! I only wish this featured more songs. If you buy this, don't forget to watch the ""bonus"" tracks.",1516838400,,131,4.739130434782608
8735573,3,B01648P5HY,Excellent talent on show. But what is wrong with PBS......they produce a concert but only put some of the content in....and put the rest in extra content. A weird practice making this less than it should be.,1510790400,,207,4.621621621621622
8735574,5,B01648P5HY,Good selection of songs by the Broadway stars.  Good evening's entertainment,1506124800,,76,5.909090909090909

8735576,1,B01648P5HY,"Not nearly as good as ""And the World Goes Round."" Performers
are technically excellent, but the staging and song selections
are rather pedestrian. How can they cut a 2.5 hour show into 50 minutes?",1483056000,2,196,4.794117647058823
