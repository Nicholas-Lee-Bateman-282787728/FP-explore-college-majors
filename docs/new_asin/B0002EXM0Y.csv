8591503,5,B0002EXM0Y,"I was not expecting much from this production, but I was pleasantly surprised. Most of this documentary focuses on the actual dances, which I thought was a really nice touch. There are some very interesting interviews as well with young dancers [in their early teens] who explain how they got involved with folk dancing and how did it change their lives. Even if you're not Hungarian or central European you can still enjoy the music and the choreography. Great entertainment.",1088812800,,476,4.9625
