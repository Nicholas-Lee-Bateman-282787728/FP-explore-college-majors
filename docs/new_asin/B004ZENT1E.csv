4507974,4,B004ZENT1E,"The longest-awaited and most ambitious crossover of TWO MGM-film franchises blend into one with this 7th and newest entry in the Tom-and-Jerry full-length cartoon films from Warner Bros. Animation entitled ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"", and given that I am a big fan of both the original 1940's Tom-and-Jerry theatrical cartoons and the 1939 all-time classic of ""The Wizard of Oz"" that starred Judy Garland and directed by Victor Fleming, I was QUITE rather looking forward to this one when it had it available for a pre-release rental on Amazon Video-on-Demand... here I go!!

For the first 12 minutes of this picture after the opening credits, I thought the story moved briskly along in a concise, yet well-done style, and I loved how Tom and Jerry interacted well with it to give it some depth and some real good laughs.  So I thought that was nicely done right there, and the singing of Dorothy Gale in animation and vocal was impressively done in its re-telling of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" as one of the songs from the 1939 live-action motion picture original.  On Blu-ray/DVD of this 2011 animated film, there is a special ""classic""-style option available where you actually can see these opening scenes in original Sepia tones right up to when these main cat-and-mouse characters open the doors to reveal the land of Oz, and I think it is a WISE move of Warner Bros. to include that up there for the upcoming physical release of this, which clearly makes for a much better, better impact when you see it... be sure not to miss that interesting option indeed since this will truly enhance the whole experience, so watch for it in the special features of this one when it comes out on home video!!!  ^-^

Further on, there are plenty more familiar scenes and even more familiar dialogue that a lot of you can SURELY remember from the 1939 original being faithfully translated on here, as well as some additional new dialogue towards Tom and Jerry... it comes out as a bit of a mixed bag; some are recreated well, while some others are lacking.  However, there are some brand-new scenes (like the yellow-brick bridge scene) as well as a few new characters, and I thought they are not bad at all.  But more importantly, since this is a Tom-and-Jerry full-length animated film after all, I have viewed this best on the basis of how Tom and Jerry are actually ""discovering"" this story for themselves for the very first time without acting in a predictable way... and this new movie *actually* surprised me very pleasantly in that regard, yet it DOES manage to be quite fun in its own right (not to mention plenty more laughs along the way!) that keep the experience from being stale quickly.  Furthermore, if you view this additionally as a companion piece to the 1939 film version of ""The Wizard of Oz"", then not only do you see two different shades to the story of sorts while it is being followed both ways, but this 2011 animated re-telling of this story itself really manages to be interesting, quite surprisingly!!  ;)

On the plus side also, the animation is superbly well done in which it reminded me of the early 1940's style of the MGM theatrical cartoons, the background music is quite faithful in many ways, and the background, landscapes, and buildings were recreated beautifully in animation form, given its source material from that 1939 original classic indeed.

Grey DeLisle as the voice of Dorothy is wonderful and most convincing, and I especially love her Southern accent as well; almost as flawless as in the 1939 film itself... superb!!  Nikki Yanofsky provides her singing voice, and she I thought she was fantastic in the re-telling of the song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from within minutes after the 2011 animated Tom-and-Jerry film version first opens... brilliant!!!  Laraine Newman is TRULY outstanding as the voice of the Wicked Witch of the West, whose cunning and malevolent charm reminded me a lot clearly of why that main antagonistic character from the 1939 original was the one that you *absolutely* loved to hate with a passion... she is suited for the role just perfectly here!!!  And watch for Butch and Droopy in cameo appearances near the end of the film where they play the witch's royal guards, and they're voiced by Joe Alaskey, who is also really good as the voice of Oz the Great and Powerful Wizard himself on which he provides it as well.  The rest of the voice cast deliver some solid vocal performances as well.

On the whole, ""Tom and Jerry and The Wizard of Oz"" is best viewed 1) on the basis of how Tom and Jerry are actually ""discovering"" this story for the first time on their own without being predictable; and 2) as a companion piece to the 1939 grand American film classic of ""The Wizard of Oz"", because I was so pleasantly surprised at how strangely interesting this entry is!  It may not be a perfect film (as there are some rough edges and a few missing key scenes), but it is quite a solid one... and with the inclusion of the special ""Classic""-style feature for the Blu-ray/DVD release, I will bump up my star rating from three to four (4) stars out of five from me on this early review.  For this reason, be sure to check the physical release of this out when it comes this late-August 2011... it does stand a potential shot at being another fine Tom-and-Jerry feature-film entry after all!!  ;)",1309824000,3,5373,4.702875399361022
4507975,5,B004ZENT1E,Love it. The kids love it and that is what counts. They love the original Wizard of Oz movie too. If you have a PS3 you can watch it on the playstation store. Only disapointment is its only 60 min. It might be disapointing to get on blu ray or dvd if its priced at $20. But overall the movie is great.,1308614400,,301,3.870967741935484
4507976,3,B004ZENT1E,"Caught this the other night on Pay Per View, and didn't quite know what to think. Some incredibly faithful artwork and direction uncannily re-creates the feeling and look of the 1939 film, (though sadly the first ten minutes are not sepia toned: an odd misstep). Animation is wonderful, and very much echoes the late forties and early fifties MGM ""T&J"" shorts. Droopy, Spike, Red, and others appear, but somehow this new ""Tom and Jerry"" effort doesn't ring the same bells as their previous ""Sherlock Holmes"" outing, possibly because the Judy Garland film is so sacred to so many people. Many fans may resent the new recording and performance of ""Over the Rainbow"".To devotees of Judy's iconic version, this new iteration may feel like an insult, though it's well done. I'm guessing this scene is the thing most will be curious to see. Settings, credits, backgrounds, and music (lifted from the original ""Oz"") ape that film in some remarkable ways. Larraine Newman does a fine job as the voice of the Wicked Witch...but Tom and Jerry feel intrusive here, and their slapstick, welcome in the Sherlock Holmes film, doesn't quite come off. For completists, well...you'd have to own this, and the art is really sharp. Animation fans will respond to the carefully intricate character work. But  this had the feeling of shrewd marketing, despite polished and handsome production values. Why ""Tom and Jerry"" and ""Oz""? Both are MGM properties, so the leap isn't really as vast as some may think. Now they should do ""Tom and Jerry meet Carrie"" (since MGM owns that film now, too). We're waiting... When the DVD officially arrives I'll update this review to include the specs, aspect ratio, and features. This review merely covers the film, as seen on Pay Per View.",1308182400,3,1754,4.925675675675675

4508064,1,B004ZENT1E,I hate The Wizard Of OZ but like Tom & Jerry so I didn't know what to expect. Tom & Jerry were awesome as usual but the movie stuck way to close to the original Wizard Of OZ & that's why I hated it. If you're an OZ fan then that's why you'll probably like it. Even in Special Features you can watch it in *Original* color. I also could've done without all the singing. Take Tom & Jerry out of it & this is an animated movie I would've never watched,1432080000,,448,3.880434782608696

It plays out almost exactly like the original, and there is even a version with the sepia tone in the beginning just like the original. Only difference really is that its animated, and Tom and Jerry are placed into the movie as Dorothy's protectors. They don't take over though and are placed into the story very well.

4508272,3,B004ZENT1E,"Two of MGM's most enduring properties have been the Tom And Jerry cartoons, and the 1939 movie of The Wizard Of Oz. So it was possibly only a matter of time when it was decided to merge both of them in one production. Tom And Jerry And The Wizard Of Oz is a new title from Warner Home Video in their ongoing series of Tom And Jerry animated flicks that takes a cue from Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead where this story takes place in the context of the original movie story, but Tom and Jerry could've been seen as secondary characters who get taken along for the ride along, with a few of the other regular Tom And Jerry characters making cameos.

In this storyline Tom and Jerry are workers on the Gale farm(but not farm animals!), and promise Aunt Em to stop fighting to watch after Dorothy(apparently Toto isn't smart enough to do that!). But then, the twister carries them along with Dorothy and Toto to Oz, where Tom And Jerry are informed by a Munchkin mouse named Tuffy about Dorothy's arrival. The three of them head down the Yellow Brick Road, and get into a situation at a bridge similar to the Kalidah scene from the book. After getting hassled by some crows come, they across the Wicked Witch of the West(convincingly voiced Laraine Newman), who gets her wand broken for her troubles. After getting reunited with Dorothy and her three new friends, they go to the Emerald City. They get into the usual schpeel of touring the city while meeting the Wizard, and revieve their marching orders to go get the Witch's broom. Dorothy gets captured by the flying monkeys, so Tom and Jerry disguise themselves as Winkie guards to sneak in the Witch's castle. They discover Droopy working there as an instructor, and get chased all over the place only to find him wherever they hide at, but eventually find out the Witch's weakness to water. Tom, Jerry, and Tuffy then go through an exuberantly long routine to get a bucket of water, and then finally splash it on the Witch. They then return to the E.C. to reveal that the Wizard's a fake. He agrees to take Dorothy back home by balloon, although she misses her flight. Glinda shows up to give the deus ex machina of getting everyone back to Kansas.

I have to admit I did like this to an extent. They managed to make it a good balance between one of the numerous Tom And Jerry made-for-video animated movies and the original Wizard Of Oz. The film also gives the Oz regulars a good look, although I thought Dorothy might've looked a little too much like a Disney princess. It was directed by Spike Bradt who has done other Tom And Jerry features as well as some of the current Looney Tunes shows, and his appreciation for classic 50s-60s cartoons shows in this production. It's a good watch at least for a rental or whenever its on TV for regular Oz fans, although most modern day youngins might not totally appreciate it.",1323561600,3,2881,4.527831094049904
4508273,4,B004ZENT1E,"""Cartoon Network"" has been playing this unlikely crossover movie for some time now.  Being a ""Tom and Jerry"" and, of course, ""Wizard of Oz"" movie fan, I plopped myself into my easy chair and watched ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"" (hereafter T&J&WOOZ) one day, curious to see if it would work.  To my delightful surprise, it does, and should satisfy both ""Tom and Jerry"" and ""Wizard of Oz (1939)"" fans.

The cartoon is essentially a nearly shot-for-shot duplication of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (including the ""Over the Rainbow"" singing sequence), with Tom and Jerry accidentally tagging along for the ride.  The only scenes missing are Dorothy's first encounters with the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion, plus a few minor others, which was prudent because otherwise it would have inhibited T&J&WOOZ's manic pace.  In this feature, the cat and mouse are mostly allies, trying to help Dorothy get back home to Kansas.  However, every so often, they hilariously get their licks in against each other.  Other ""Tom and Jerry universe"" characters appear, such as Tuffy the Munchkin Mouse, who wants the Wizard to make him taller (SPOILER: The Wizard gives him stilts), Droopy the phlegmatic head of the witch's guard, and Spike the Irish bulldog as a hapless guard trainee who always manages to hit Droopy with his pikestaff.

I think both children and adults will enjoy this lightning-paced and even harrowingly suspenseful movie, especially the climactic scene as Tom, Jerry, and Tuffy attempt to get a bucket of water to Dorothy to take care of the Wicked Witch of the West, including lassoing a little storm cloud. It has vintage Tom and Jerry cartoon violence (including lightning jolts) but nothing too upsetting except for really sensitive children.  But somehow TJ&WOOZ preserves and respects ""Wizard""'s classic stature with fluid, vibrant colors and movement, and even enhances it with the cat and mouse's presence.  The duo are not a sideshow; they truly are integral to ""Wizard""'s plot.  It's kinda like an animated ""Wizard of Oz: The Lost Scenes"".

So please relax, ""Wizard of Oz"" movie purists.  T&J&WOOZ is no travesty.  Not at all.",1322697600,2,2150,5.019718309859155

4508289,4,B004ZENT1E,"While classic cartoons from Bugs Bunny to Garfield the cat are busy getting (largely unwelcome) 21st century makeovers, it's comforting to see MGM allowing Tom & Jerry to pretty much remain themselves in a series of direct-to-videos features.  Even as the stories are getting more ambitious (such as in the duo's previous release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Jerry-Meet-Sherlock-Holmes-Blu-ray/dp/B0040MO90Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom & Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes [Blu-ray</a>]), the beloved cat-and-mouse team has remained mostly unchanged.

So here we find them inserted into one of the most-loved stories of all time.  For longtime fans like myself, the very title alone brings shivers of anticipation.  Tom and Jerry combined with the Wizard of Oz?  How can you go wrong?  And as others have pointed out, this is isn't simply the L. Frank Baum ""Oz"" story, it's the defintive MGM film version that is being utilized.

Right there at the Gale farm among Dorothy, Toto and those hired hands, we find Tom and Jerry.  And they're not just tagging along; Auntie Em tells the pair to be sure and ""look out for Dorothy"" right before the tornado strikes.  From there, the story unfolds almost exactly as it does in the film version.  This is both a great asset AND a bit of a liability, however.  The only real problem I have with this otherwise entertaining and very well-animated film is that things happen a bit too fast.  It's as if the writers are saying ""OK, we all know what happens in Munchkinland, so we can just skip over that.""  And Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road is also very abbreviated; indeed, the cat and mouse (who've picked up a Munchkin mouse, the only other real deficit here) arrive too late to see Dorothy meeting the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion.

The voicework and animation are all top-notch, especially for a made-for-video feature.  And if you overlook the stuff I mentioned above, you'll likely to have a good time.  Like all the previous Tom & Jerry features, it's perfectly safe for kids.  There's even some kid-friendly activities in the bonus materials.  Oh, and be sure to watch the film with the sepia-toned opening scenes (listed here, oddly, as a bonus feature) to get the real classic Wizard of Oz effect.

Recommended for fans of T & J and The Wizard of Oz.",1315094400,2,2366,5.0987012987012985
4508290,5,B004ZENT1E,"I watched Tom and Jerry as a kid and when we saw the Wizard of Oz spin, I wasn't sure what to expect.  It's terrific.  The OZ character voices in the cartoon seems to come from the original movie with Judy Garland.... but the songs and other characters were created with a Tom and Jerry spin.  (Munchkins now mice)  This is fun for everyone in our family.

The storyline (without spoiling things) is that Tom and Jerry follow Dorothy to OZ to help bring her home.  Dorothy's trip is true to the Wizard of OZ movie and it is a pleasant blend of a classic with a new animated twist.

I also greatly appreciate the digital copy.  This allowed us to load directly on iPod for our upcoming road trip.  We can all watch and listen in the car without lugging around a pile of DVDs or a laptop.  I will definitely be buying more in this format.",1314921600,2,836,4.234177215189874
4508291,5,B004ZENT1E,"In their newest direct-to-video movie, the classic cat and mouse cartoon team of Tom and Jerry are inserted not merely into the beloved L. Frank Baum story of ""The Wizard of Oz"", but the full-on MGM feature film version, complete with the styles and songs seen in the original film, though completely redone here in traditionally animated format. As Dorothy ends up in the magical land of Oz and on her quest to see the wizard and return home to a farm in Kansas, Tom and Jerry try their best to catch up with her (which they quickly do) and get home too, having made a promise to Auntie Em that they would look after Dorothy and Toto. But, the Wicked Witch of the West is hot on their trails and wants revenge on Tom and Jerry as much as on Dorothy and Toto themselves!

WB's original movie, ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"" has been high on my wish list ever since I first saw the cover art here on Amazon. As a huge fan of both animation and the original MGM Oz film, I've been patiently but eagerly waiting for it to come out, and now I finally have it in my hands on Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo, and I'm so glad! Is it a perfect production? No, a direct-to-video budget probably would never allow for that, but it's very good in a lot of ways. One of the best things about it is, for certain, the art and animation. The film does a great job replicating the visuals of the classic MGM movie here in cartoon format. It's really neat to see. The animation is just as direct-to-video animation should be. It's not quite theatrical quality, but it's close. I haven't seen any of the other Tom and Jerry direct to video movies yet, so I can't really compare them, aside from the Nutcracker one they did. I would put this on par with that one, though it's been a while since I've seen it. I think the earlier ones might not be as good. Like the Tom and Jerry Nutcracker program, this one has a touch of that Spumco look, but only in the best ways, like how they draw gorgeous girls. Dorothy is an absolute goddess here, which was a big deal for me since Dorothy from the original film was my first crush ever, and one of the best things about animation is the potential to bring drop-dead gorgeous, absolutely perfect female characters to life. They did a fantastic job here, and the women of the Emerald City are jaw-dropping as well, if too briefly seen (you can probably guess where this is; the bit when they are sprucing up the gang before going to see the wizard).

There are basically two sides to this story. You are getting an animated version of the classic MGM Oz film, and you're getting a Tom and Jerry adventure (one that is far better and truer to the characters than ""Tom and Jerry the Movie"", but then maybe all these direct-to-video features fit that bill). With that in mind, sometimes you feel you are watching something in the vein of ""Lion King 1"", and sometimes you feel like you're watching an Animaniacs parody. In truth, this film probably SHOULD be more like the latter in terms of the writing. That is where it lets you down a bit. Maybe it was a budget issue that sometimes things seem a bit rushed story/humor wise, but I do feel that some more playful humor should have been worked into the many scenes that are taken directly from the movie. Much of it is nearly word for word, while a bit more spoofing might have worked better to keep the Tom and Jerry story and the original film's story feeling like they were ONE story. There is some of this, thankfully, especially in scenes with the villains, and it's enough, but more would have been better, I think. I also can't help but feel that maybe they should have used a Garland recording for the performance of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", because how can you really replace her for that? But I guess that is being a bit nit-picky. Over all, this is an excellent direct-to-video film, and I just wish it was longer. It clocks in at just under an hour (59 minutes, according to the cover), and that's a bit short for a 20 dollar flick. Plus, a lot of scenes that weren't shown (from the original Oz film) were very missed. We don't even see Dorothy meeting any of her Oz friends. The group is assembled by the time Tom and Jerry catch up to them. It might have been better to lengthen the film by just keeping Tom and Jerry at Dorothy and Toto's side from the beginning instead of having to catch up with them late after the tornado, but actually, I think the scene that, for some reason, I missed the most here was the one at the beginning in Professor Marvel's Wagon. It just seemed like it was supposed to be there. Oh well. Aside from the shortness and times when I felt the writing could have been more clever, I was very pleased with a lot of the humor that WAS included and that felt very true to the classic MGM cartoon spirit, like the bit where Tom meet's Tuffy and gets hit with the frying pan, and when he and Jerry encounter Droopy and do one of Droopy's best routines with an Oz flare. No, this film isn't perfect, but it's still a big win that was well worth waiting for, and as others have said, it's worth owning for the visuals alone! The voice cast, though not the best sound-alikes I've heard, were also great (okay, Tuffy's a little annoying though; I prefer the sweet, French-accented Tuffy), and thank you so much for keeping Tom and Jerry silent, as they should be for the most part!

As for the Blu-Ray itself, it's a little disappointing that there are only 2 bonus features, and one is actually not a bonus feature but an alternate version of the film. I'm so glad that alternate version was included though. It SHOULD be the primary version of the film, because it is the way you SHOULD watch ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"". It's a version of the film with the beginning and ending in sepia tones, as in the original MGM feature. It IS cool to have the full color version as well, but THAT is the version that should be in the special features section. As for the other bonus, it's a little science lesson of 3 activities that are Oz related. Making your own tornado in a bottle, making a rainbow, and how a hot air balloon works (which could have been demonstrated better, I think), they're cute and probably fun for kids, but where are the classic MGM shorts as bonus features? That's what you SHOULD have here, or a little making-of documentary.

All in all, ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"" is a great little movie, though it may seem a bit pricey for being just about an hour and so light on bonus features. Still, if that is how they keep things at this quality, I'll pay it. Some of the writing could have been snappier, but it was still great and worth the purchase, especially if you're a fan of Oz and/or Tom and Jerry! Now, if they would just release that Saturday morning animated series that was based on the MGM Oz film. I think it was on in the early 90's, but not certain about that.",1314316800,14,6926,4.341820987654321

Well if you're like me and enjoy a good crossover story, then you may just enjoy this one. As two of the most famous MGM properties come together in a film of a lifetime courtesy of Warner Bros and Turner Entertainment Co. :D

This was shown upon the Cartoon Network on the weekend of August 13-14 and I was able to catch bits and pieces of it throughout both of its showings. It is truly a fun side-story of the famous 1938 movie. However, small bits and pieces of the original movie were either altered or cut off for time for this film to be made. Yet, it is still an enjoyable tale to treat yourself or your and your family as some of the films most classic songs gets a twist or two in the process.

I must say that you can be expecting a true twist upon the such a classic favorite of film cinema. So if you all want a great tale and are either a fan of Tom and Jerry or a modern fan of Wizard of Oz film, then this movie is for you.",1313280000,,977,3.949238578680203

It's the curious and inventive kind of cross-fertilization that has always appealed to me. Of course, I chose to watch this DVD's ""Classic"" version, with the Kansas scenes in sepia and white. It starts out like the 1939 movie redone almost word for word in animation. Not until Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are rescuing chicks from the broken incubator do we see any big change: Jerry Mouse is on an adding machine keeping count of the chicks! Throughout, I delight in the cleverness with which the Hanna-Barbara characters are worked into the story. The original movie is much abridged -- even Dorothy's first meeting with Professor Marvel is gone -- but with so familiar a movie, this was probably the animators' best approach, especially with a new Tom & Jerry subplot to weave in. And well woven I found it, as the cat and mice (Tuffy shows up as a Munchkin mouse) get separated from and reunited with Dorothy's group more than once, on the way answering a question or two we may never have realized needed asking. E.g.: having seen the '39 movie times beyond counting, I am sure it's originally Uncle Henry who, in putting Toto into Miss Gulch's basket, leaves it unlatched for Toto's escape: but it hurts nothing to let Tom & Jerry do it instead, for a spectacular cartoon sequence. On the other hand, how DOES that bucket or water get there, ready to Dorothy's hand, just standing around in the castle of a Wicked Witch to whom water is deadly? And I was thoroughly delighted when my dear old acquaintance Droopy showed up as a Winkie guard.
  One thing much of Oz fandom may still hold against the '39 movie is that ""it all turns out to be a dream."" In this version, it definitely does not: they make it rather plain that my own childhood instinct was correct: the dream explanation is only how the magic makes it acceptable to the grown-ups.",1526688000,,1986,4.52924791086351

Andrews Blu-ray Review: TOM AND JERRY & THE WIZARD OF OZ ORIGINAL MOVIE is a 2011 direct-to-video animated film starring Tom and Jerry, and produced by the Warner Bros. Animation. The animated film is a remake of the M-G-M 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz with the addition of Tom and Jerry, who would originally debut in the series for their M-G-M cartoon films a year later, and now incorporating them into this animated film as major supporting characters. Droopy and Butch also cameo as minor antagonists. Move over Munchkins! Tom and Jerry have landed in the magical Land of Oz and are gearing up for an unforgettable adventure along with Dorothy, Toto and other beloved characters in the TOM AND JERRY & THE WIZARD OF OZ ORIGINAL MOVIE animated film.

Kansas farm girl Dorothy Gale owns a pet cat named Tom and a pet mouse named Jerry. Tom and Jerry's rivalry gets in the way of the Gales' farm work. But they work together to rescue Dorothy when she topples off the pigsty fence railing and into the pigsty. Since Tom and Jerry are very good at looking after Dorothy and this usually keeps the rivalry out of the way, Auntie Em asks Tom and Jerry to promise her they'd put their rivalry aside and work together to protect Dorothy.

At first, Tom and Jerry are reluctant, but they really don't want Dorothy to get hurt, so they agree to be friends and keep an eye on her. But when the wicked Miss Gulch comes to take the dog Toto away to have him put to sleep, Tom and Jerry work together to follow Miss Gulch and to save Toto the dog and in doing so is recreating the original M-G-M 1939 classic film scenario in this really beautiful classic animation film with the infusion of Tom and Jerry to aid Dorothy along her journey. This new animated film literally picks up where the last one left off and then fully realizes a new adventure, including familiar locations, costumes, characters and even songs.

In this fun and unique story, Tom and Jerry are twisted up into a powerful tornado, and Dorothy, Toto, Tom, and Jerry are too late to join Dorothy's family in the storm cellar. Dorothy goes inside the house to find Auntie Em and Uncle Henry. Tom and Jerry try to make as much noise as they can to get Auntie Em and Uncle Henry to hear them, but the twister gets closer. Tom and Jerry get knocked out when trying to get inside the house, and they are twisted up in a twister, soar over the rainbow and down the yellow brick road, where they encounter some of the legendary story's most cherished characters in the Land of Oz.

They meet Tuffy the Munchkin Mouse, and he explains what happened when he, the other Munchkins, and Glinda the Good Witch of the North met Dorothy after she killed the Wicked Witch of the East. As Tom and Jerry skip down the Yellow Brick Road, Tuffy warns them not to follow Dorothy. Tom goes along with this, but Jerry reminds him that they promised they'd keep Dorothy out of danger. Tuffy asks if he can go. Tom laughs at how small Tuffy is, but Tuffy is very insecure about his size, so he decides to ask the Wizard of Oz to make him big.

Tom and Jerry team up with Tuffy, and they catch up with Dorothy, who has also made new friends on her way to see the Wizard and ask him to send her home. But they need to watch out for the Wicked Witch of the West, who's angry with Dorothy for killing the Wicked Witch of the East and Tom and Jerry for saving Dorothy from having her Ruby Slippers taken away.

There is something sacred about the original M-G-M 1939 classic film and to some purist thinks the concept of doing a direct sequel of an animate film almost sacrilegious, but produced by Warner Bros Animation, and taking full advantage of the Oscar-winning music score, it is like a total dream come true and stepping back into the fantasy the original M-G-M 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz vision and in a way only the Warner Bros Animation could do. The vocal artist talents pay homage to the iconic cast and new characters, featuring the celebrity voices of Jason Alexander, Andrea Martin, Frances Conroy and Broadways James Monroe Iglehart. What is more, for the faithful fans out there of L. Frank Baums Wizard of Oz books, the new evil in Oz is loosely based on his work.

The greatest highlight is seeing a fully realised production of The Jitterbug, a song originally written for the M-G-M 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz, which was deleted from the Judy Garland film. It is wonderfully used in this animated film with great delight. The new songs are true to the spirit of the originals. Especially great is Dorothys new Kansas tune, Theres No Place Like Home. The inclusion of Tom and Jerry never distracts from the main plot or other characters. There is an option to view the film with Kansas scenes in sepia tone and in doing so allowing for a closer-to-the-classic film experience. So all in all it is a charming fun return to the Land of Oz that we all want to escape to and thanks to the creative minds of Warner Bros Animation, now we can!

Blu-ray Image Quality  Once again Warner Home Video brings you this Blu-ray disc in a fantastic 1080p image presentation that is 100% crisp and colourful, that sometimes have the colours bursting out of the screen and you also get wonderful crisp and stunning colourful images as well. What are also outstanding are the lovely vibrant reds, suitably witch like greens, stormy greys, vivid blues, inky blacks abound, and contrast and clarity is 100% spot on. The brilliant animators work is particularly refined and every last flick of their pens with their CGI computer generated touch is as sharp as it should be. So all in all a good effort all round.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video brings you a fantastic 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound experience, that is bright and lively, and when you get to hear Tom and Jerry being tossed around too and fro, throughout storm and tornado, you feel you are with them in all the excitement. Dialogue is crystal clear and neatly positioned with your centre speaker, and the sound effects are very effective, especially with all your speakers working, you have a few standout brilliant moments. On top of all that, the animated film music does a really fine job and is very immersive, and with some nice directional flourishes that keeps things exciting at times throughout the animated film, a handful of hearty loud boom sounds make their presence known now and again to great effect. What is also brilliant is there is some nice directional flourishes that keep things exciting, a handful of hearty booms make their presence known, an there is a decent amount of whirlwind fun sounds to be had by all. So once again, a good effort all round.

The first experiment is how to make an IDEAL RAINBOW, and they inform us that all you need is a half-filled glass bowel of water, a small mirror, a torch, a piece of black card, a piece of white card, a pair of scissors, a roll of cellophane tape, and a piece of chalk.

LEGENDS OF THE PHANTOSAUR ORIGINAL MOVIE [2011] [1080i] [1.37:1] [00:58]. SCOOBY-DOO! MYSTERY INCORPORATED [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:44].

Finally, with this TOM AND JERRY & THE WIZARD OF OZ ORIGINAL MOVIE Blu-ray disc is of course a crossover animated film in homage to the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, and especially by the classic Hanna-Barbera duo Tom and Jerry end up in the story with Dorothy and eventually landing over the rainbow in the magical Land of Oz. Like all Tom and Jerry cartoons, you can expect loads of slapstick, cartoon violence, and especially with a bit of added creepiness thrown in for good measure. There are plenty of scenes that will be familiar that you viewed in the 1939 original Technicolor film and it is wonderfully crisp colourful animation that is extremely very well-done and can be appreciated by all age groups. For anyone that has wanted to introduce their children to the magic of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, but has worried about the darker aspect of the film, as per example with the evil Wicked Witch of the West, whereas this animated cartoon version is a great deal of fun and frolics and especially with loads of fun filled laugh a minute slapstick, that everyone will thoroughly enjoy. Highly Recommended!
