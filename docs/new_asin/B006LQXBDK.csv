8500507,1,B006LQXBDK,as another reviewer stated.....chop job.  this pic was released in 2:35 format.  why do they release movies with half the visual missing? STOP BUYING CHOP JOBS & maybe they will finally come around.  5 stars movie & 0 stars dvd,1379203200,11,227,4.625
8500508,1,B006LQXBDK,"In a way it's a very nice gesture by studios to finally release rare and little known films on DVD. But it would be nicer if the studios would release the original widescreen 2.35 : 1 Aspect Ratio not the fullscreen 4:3 Pan and Scan 1.33:1 version with approximately 30-40% of the film missing from side to side. The previous reviewer noted that the clarity and quality were excellent, I have to question that statement because when you zoom, pan and scan the color is washed out and the closeups are out of focus. Pan and scan in actuality is redirecting the camera shots, this is a travesty and insult to everyone involved in the making of films. The majority of 21st century Americans now own widescreen TV's and expect to see all films NOT ""formatted to fit your TV"" versions from the 20th century. If we the customers stand together and (boycott) refuse to buy the cropped and chopped DVD releases, then this may force studios to dig a little deeper into their film vaults and find the original aspect ratios. Please pardon my simile, if you buy a new car would you not want to own 100% of the car or would you be satisfied to own only 60-70% ""car does not come with wheels and seats"" version? Thankfully the law requires to notify the purchaser which version they are buying on DVD boxes.",1379116800,12,1294,4.487288135593221
8500509,4,B006LQXBDK,This is one of my favorite Audie Murphy movies and I was delighted to see it had been put on CD.  The quality was excellent.  The sound was clear as was the picture.  I would have liked to see some extras added to the CD as has been done with other movies I have purchased but just adding this one to my collection was well worth it.  I would recommend this movie to fans of either Audie Murphy or WWII films.,1376006400,7,409,4.012345679012346
8500510,5,B006LQXBDK,I've seen this movie a couple of times on tv. I wish they would put this out on dvd's again. If you like Audie Murphy you'll enjoy this movie. All the acting is great in this movie even though it's in black & white.,1370995200,4,215,3.909090909090909
