It is composed of greiving individuals sharing stories of the loss of loved ones. Very well put together and helpful, the writer is also one of the grieving persons in the documentary. It will make you stop and think about the inevitable loss you/we all may have as we live on.",1456617600,,408,4.453333333333333
8596624,4,B00DRCY9O6,"""I am responsible. Although I may not be able to prevent the worst from happening, I am responsible for my attitude toward the inevitable misfortunes that darken life. Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have - life itself"" Walter Anderson

I know what loss is. I lost my father at a very young age and his being absent, his death defined my life from then on. After the End is a documentary about just that, how after the death...what are you to this world? The film tells the story of a handful of people. Sister loses sister, son loses father, son loses parents, parents lose a child, brother loses brother and so on. Each a complete story of love and death, and who they are in the now.

Its so important for everyone to share, to grieve, to keep remembering but to also move on with your life. I felt like this film tells us that its okay, and helps those of us who have experienced such an event and thought ""how do I live without them?"" that we are not alone.

so well done.",1378944000,3,1195,4.232456140350878
