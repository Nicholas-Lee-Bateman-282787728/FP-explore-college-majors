3920674,5,B002EYIK48,"Dennis didn't have a orchestra come in and play in the background, he write new music to be played as solos in the songs, well done Dennis!
This is a extremely enjoyable DVD to watch and to listen too! (A double CD version of this set is also available).
If your a fan of Styx, if your a fan of Dennis DeYoung....get this DVD. There is No way in the world you will be disappointed.",1278028800,4,381,4.093333333333334
3920675,5,B002EYIK48,"Former lead singer Dennis DeYoung of the 1970's-80's super group Styx, proves he's still got it. Accompanied by a 40 piece symphony, Dennis DeYoung puts a new twist on some old Styx classic's. The video transfer is spectacular and the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound rock's.

This concert DVD proves that life didn't end after Styx for Dennis DeYoung and he still loves to perform. He still has an amazing voice and really know's how to entertain the crowd. Hearing Dennis DeYoung belt out ""Mr Roboto"" was worth the price alone for this concert DVD. In my opinion this is a solid effort put out by Dennis and a welcomed addition to any DVD concert collection. Dennis DeYoung and his band were accompanied by an Orchestra and The Chicago Children's Choir for this live PBS Soundstage performance.

8368581,1,B002EYIK48,"This concert on CD is outrageously awesome. I had to give this DVD a 1 star because it doesn't work in any DVD player I own. Unfortunately, I waited too long to view this and to get a replacement to see if it works or not. I will probably re-order it in hopes of this being a bad DVD. I am an optimist, and if I do re-order it and it works, I will most definitely give it a 5 star rating. I hope that ya'll understand what a magnificent performer Dennis is, and always has been with Styx, he truly is. Styx lost a legend when they parted ways. Dennis is so very creative.",1401667200,,571,3.973913043478261
8368582,5,B002EYIK48,"This DVD is hard to find in my country (Mexico City) and I hurry to buy it, and I got it, I remember when Dennis De young came to play to Mexico City, it was a terrific concert. I recommend this DVD",1368144000,,198,3.738095238095238
8368583,3,B002EYIK48,"Before being critical I would first like to say that musically Dennis and the band are sound, and the orchestra is a great addition. However, I can't help but say that most of the concert was a little boring. This may in part be due to the fact that this was filmed for TV and the crowd who came to see Dennis with the orchestra is not your typical rock concert audience. The audience is a bit tame with their responses to the music and the band is tame also. There is very little interplay between band members who mostly stand in their place and don't move much. Though this it typical for former members of popular bands (styx in this case) who go out and get their own band and tour solo. The concert becomes about them and not the band as a whole. The former star (Deyoung in this instance) garners all the attention and has his band members standing quietly in their places, doing their job but being careful to not out-shine their boss. I'm glad I have this DVD but anyone wanting to see a great DVD of Styx music played with an orchestra should check out Styx with the Contemporary Youth Orchestra of Cleveland. Now that is an exciting concert DVD!",1356739200,,1156,4.356481481481482
8368584,3,B002EYIK48,"I had a really good time watching Dennis Deyoung perform with the symphony. The music of Styx really lends itself well to a full orchestra. I really wish the ENTIRE concert was released. As I'm glad to have it available on 2 CDs (or download in my case) it would have been awesome to view the performance of Castle Walls, or, since it was a Dennis Deyoung show, Desert Moon. The performances of the songs from Hunchback were very well done. Made me buy the album which I had never heard before and add to my Styx catalog which only consisted of Classics & Paradise Theater.

By the way I hate when they take 2 songs from a concert & give them as bonus selections!! Just keep them in their original sequence. Who wants to hear Show Me The Way out of sequence away from entire performance!? It was acapella & watching it out of sequence kinda took away from the performance. The same with Suite Madame Blue. Otherwise a very good show.",1338336000,,933,4.393063583815029
8368585,5,B002EYIK48,Great live show. Dennis is a true talent beyond his rock singing ability. He is a consummate musician and performer who is surely missed as the front man of Styx.,1335052800,,162,4.433333333333334
8368586,5,B002EYIK48,"The Band and Orchester are fabulous and Dennis own a great Voice, only the Clothes of Dennis I don't like.
He seems like a Preacher then a Rock Singer, but the Concert is great, and the quality of the DVD also.",1318204800,2,210,4.146341463414634
8368587,5,B002EYIK48,"Excellent blend of Classical symphonic overtures with traditional songs from Styx.  Dennis DeYoung has not lost a step....his voice is as great as ever as he sings popular Styx tunes and some additional songs from ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"".  A must for all fans of Styx from the DeYoung days!",1303948800,,296,4.784313725490196
8368588,5,B002EYIK48,"I first saw this concert on public television, about a month or so after seeing the current Styx group (no DeYoung of course) in Ft. Myers, FL. DVD is excellent and I strongly recommend it for any Styx fan. DeYoung, by the way, will be in concert in Sunrise, FL in February.",1295481600,4,274,4.288461538461538
