8004936,3,B0000ZMGY8,"DVD Review: It's the old Venom Mob version. It's full-screen and the picture is okay.

Movie Review: The movie is about some guy on a quest to kill some blind/deaf cripple while everyone is trying to get some knife manual. Or something. I am a fan of Hsueh Li Pao because he is like Ed Wood. His movies are usually eccentric and bizarre. I liked this movie because it's crappy and stupid and funny and the martial arts action is pretty good. However, to the ones who hated this movie: they are more so correct about this movie being completely incoherent and lagging. But I don't care about them.

In Conclusion: 3 stars for Mask Of ""Venjence"" (HUH!?) and 2 stars for the DVD.",1423612800,2,676,4.443548387096774
8004937,5,B0000ZMGY8,One of the best kung fu movies ever!! i really feel this is because of the deep emotional and dedicated connection between the starring actors. Not to say anything about the grand kung fu action within!! A PERSONAL BEST...,1364947200,2,222,4.717948717948718
