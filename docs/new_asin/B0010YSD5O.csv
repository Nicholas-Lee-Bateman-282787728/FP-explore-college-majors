3055809,3,B0010YSD5O,"The movie is OK; it's not my favorite, but I didn't think it was awful. It's probably less entertaining to adults than to small fry, but it has its moments. The closed captions are EXCELLENT, but I couldn't find that any of the extra stuff was captioned, which is a shame because some of the ecology/endangered species material is pretty interesting.",1225065600,3,350,4.754098360655738

3055811,1,B0010YSD5O,"""Dr Doolittle: Tail to the Chief"" is, in 2 words, Extremely Disappointing. --In fact, the only thing this movie and the other ""Doolittles"" have in common is the ""Doolittle"" name and that the animals --few as they are here-- ""talk.""  --First, the script's not even funny or ""uplifting"" or ""pertinent"" --or anything. Secondly, the plot is pure pre-teen fluff: Perky Teen talks to and cures the US President's cute pet spaniel's recent anti-social behavior --AND saves the Rain Forest --AND the reputation of the President as well --despite a Bad Guy who stands to make a fortune if she fails! (With such a storyline, the movie tries hard to reach even the level of Disney's recent live-action ""Princess"" movies, although it fails abjectly.) On the ""plus"" side, however, the acting is OK, with bouncy Kyla Pratt (as Doolittle's daughter) trying hard to save the movie (let alone the President, the spaniel, and the rain forest), and Peter Coyote's believably playing an otherwise totally-unbelieveable 50's ""Leave It To Beaver""-style ""kindly supportive and understanding"" President! --All in all, I'd recommend this movie only to anyone who likes to see and hear animals talk, but who otherwise cares nothing about the rest of it!",1210896000,2,1227,5.104477611940299
