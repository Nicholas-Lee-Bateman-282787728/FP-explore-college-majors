the audio is horrible it's hollow and muffled and hard to understand. its like someone recorded there voice on a laptop and a mic they bought from walmart for 9 bucks.

if the animation was the work of some highschool grade kids, then its a decent start, if its from an adult, i'm sorry but the quality is very sub par. not even up to the low standards of saturday cartoons.",1278028800,,523,4.22
