3921849,5,B002FHGF0A,This video has helped both of our children learn sign.  We now purchase it as the perfect baby shower gift.  It helps children communicate before they are able to speak.  Our kids were so much less frustrated than other babies we knew because they were able to express themselves or ask for things through sign language.  I highly recommend to all parents.,1270512000,2,356,4.693548387096774

Got this for my lil guy at about 9 mos, and he learned a lot of basic signs and shortly was able to communicate with me when he was thirsty or hungry and his favorite was the sign for more!  Worth every penny - still watch it and he's 3!",1374969600,,258,3.759259259259259
3921853,5,B002FHGF0A,"I originally bought the entire collection for my son when he was about 4 or 5 months old. I took sign in Jr, high & this video gave me a quick refresher of the basics. My son loved it & watched it as often as I would let him. WE did the signs together & before he could talk this was a great help. He could tell me what he wanted. My husband & I often tease the older kids because if baby Einsteins was on the tv when they walked into a room, they would slowly come to a stop & just be sucked in. The next thing we'd know the 13, 11 & 6 year old would all be glued to the television with the baby. My baby is now 6. I purchased this one for my nephew, my sister tells me he loves it as well.",1374278400,,691,3.6442953020134228

3921859,5,B002FHGF0A,"I like this video for the following reasons:

* Baby Einstein characters are fun and entertaining (keeps interest)
* Repetition helps to teach
* Shows sign by adults and children as well as the printed word
* Does not feel old or dated
* Segments allow for targeted learning (you choose what segment to play)
* fun music

Note: Be sure to check out ""Bonus Material"" option because there are a lot more signs that are not part of the main video: opposites and first signs",1298419200,3,470,4.453488372093023
