8335126,5,B001Q7A8IK,"My ESL adult students, our family's kids, and I really enjoyed this video about the daily lives of two Korean children. Like almost all the other videos from *Families of the World,* a boy and a girl (one city and one country dweller) are depicted going about their routines. *Families of Korea* highlights some of what is unique about Korean life while showing kids in other countries how much they have in common with Heejin and Kitae. We watched this and were intrigued about what the Korean kids eat (kimchee is a staple at most meals) and with the mask dancing or martial arts training Kitae and Heejin enjoy. One of our neighbor's kids wanted to know more about the wood carving of traditional cultural figures, which he thought was extremely cool, and he now wants to learn how to make sculpture and masks in wood. (This has come up repeatedly since we watched this video---my only caveat on purchasing it!)

I'd recommend checking out the video clips that the distributor posts on YouTube. Search on ""Families of Korea (Families of the World) Rural Trailer"" and ""Urban Trailer."" The clips capture the charm and excellent production quality of every entry in this video series, and they show why *Families of Korea* is worth sharing with your students and the kids in your life.",1290038400,2,1285,4.762331838565022
