A romantic & conflicted vampire awakens after 25 years and encounters some off-beat, but realistic characters, each with their own foibles and circumstances that are each affected by his presence.

802047,5,6304171781,"Offbeat, quirky, funny and poignant, ""Blood and Donuts"" is a low-budget, 90's-era Canadian diamond-in-the-rough of a film that's in the true spirit of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Fright Night."" Leading man Gordon Currie creates a sympathetic, scruffy vampire who's by turns winsome, shy, awkward, mysterious, haunted, lost, fearsome and charming, yet at all times so adorably genuine you just want to hug him. Add to the mix Justin Louis as an eccentric cabbie with a bizarre accent that's one part annoying and two parts endearing; Genie Award-nominee Helene Clarkson as a wry and whip-smart waitress who captures the vampire's hurting heart; Fiona Reid as an aging former love who's bitter and bent on immortality; and David Cronenberg himself as a mobster with some of the script's best one-liners; and you've got the perfect recipe for a sweet treat of a movie that I found surprisingly watchable.

Unlike the current batch of Twilight-esque vamps who twinkle and shimmer in the sunlight, vampire Boya spends most of his time brooding in the bathtub of a seedy hotel. He's at a crossroads, having decided to abstain from human bloodlust and wondering about the value of a life that forces him to forsake any chance at a meaningful relationship. The tentative way he shyly pines for sharp-tongued waitress Molly is lovably heartbreaking. In fact, throughout the movie's 89-minute running time, Boya's compassionate nature and ambivalence toward his vampiric existence are constantly evident. His ancient-looking shoulder tattoo is never discussed, but hints at a creature who has seen far too much and yearns for some kind of everlasting release. When cabbie Earl nervously observes that vampires usually dine on people, Boya sighs heavily, ""That was another time, another century."" He's withdrawn and world-weary, yet craving a level of heartfelt connection that can never be his.

If you have the chance to pick up a copy of ""Blood & Donuts,"" jump on it. Then grab a donut (or two), pop some popcorn, and settle in for a bitingly funny, enjoyably bittersweet experience that also happens to include a bunch of awesome oldies soundtrack hits like ""Blue Moon"" and ""Twilight Time."" Inventive, sweet, sad and funny all at once -- truly,  an underrated gem.",1355011200,,2261,5.138586956521739
802048,5,6304171781,"If you enjoy offbeat, quirky, semi-humorous vampire fare like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you will truly enjoy this movie. Clearly shot on a low budget, this sweet, nostalgic Canadian gem nonetheless boasts a fantastic oldies soundtrack (Twilight Time, Blue Moon), a great cast, and the judicious use of some surprisingly effective vampire morphing effects. It also comes amazingly close to PG-rated for a movie that contains numerous ""feeding"" episodes, a shovel-handle staking, and one of the most highly inventive love scenes I've ever witnessed. It's funny, poignant, ironic and touching all at once. It also includes a chuckle-inducing cameo from David Cronenberg. I could watch this film over and over again.

Lead actor Gordon Currie uses his good looks and big blue eyes to craft a lovable, shy, awkward, charming, scruffy, lost puppy-dog of a lead character. Boya is an ancient vampire who loves the simple beauty of the moon, cherishes human life, and is clearly feeling lost, isolated, and uncomfortable with the immortal, blood-sucking state to which he's been reduced. He's awakened from his quarter-century ""nap"" in true Rube Goldberg fashion by an errant golf ball. He then spends several amusing scenes trying to work out the stiffness and kinks such a nap would undoubtedly produce. He strikes up a protective friendship with a funny cabbie, plus a sweet romance with Molly, the waitress at an all-night donut shop who manages to arrest his attention with her spunky attitude, quick wit and dark beauty. He comes in looking for raw liver (!), and more or less unfazed, Molly gets him settled with an ever-elusive kiwi-jelly donut (""You know, Kiwi - like New Zealand?""  ""Yeah, I'm familiar""), which seems to perk him up just a little.

Boya is being pursued by an old lover (the wonderful Fiona Reid from ""My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding"") who is bitter about her advancing age, and angry that Boya won't give her the ""gift"" of immortality. Through numerous ensuing scenes and setups, Currie does a fantastic job conveying Boya's sensitive caring nature, his many regrets, his reluctance to continue in his present state, yet his ultimate fear of death.

One of the most humorous, touching, and well-made low-budget films I've ever seen, this vampire flick has some bite -- but mostly, a ton of heart. An overlooked diamond in the rough that should have received much more fanfare. Easily Currie's best role, with Helene Clarkson receiving a Genie nomination for best female lead as Molly.",1355011200,2,2498,5.070559610705596
802049,5,6304171781,"I love this movie!

802050,5,6304171781,"...Blood & Donuts is perhaps the most novel vampire movie out there. Not just because of its odd juxtaposition of comestibles, but because, instead of focussing on the dark, sexy power of the vampiric legends, it zooms in on the mundane, making its chief character, Boya, actually a bit smaller than life, a lost bit of jetsam in the stream of time.

The story is simple: Boya, an ages-old creature of the night, goes into a funk in 1969, when humans reduce the moon from an untouchable, deified source of wonder to a piece of property with a great view. He wakes up again about 25 years later, to find the world has moved on ...a lot. He finds shelter in that most normal of places, a donut shop, and makes a few friends who, after the initial shock, accept him as just another guy. A piece of his past resurfaces and spends a lot of time trying to kill him for not killing her. There's an entire side story involving a petty mob boss. This is all nice and novel, but let's face it, we've seen these gimmicks as audiences require some spice to their horror diet. Novel is predictable.

What makes this movie great is that Boya really _is_ just a guy. He's regretful, not in the angsty gothic oh-the-dark-anguish-of-being-undead mode one normally sees, but in a resigned, human, manner. He's insecure, embarrassed about his blood-sucking nature, lonely, alienated, and altogether as pitiable as a lost puppy. These are things everyone feels at some time or another (okay, except the blood-sucking. What, you don't suck blood? Really?) And, while he affects a few lives, they're small lives, and you get the feeling the living will shrug and move on when he's gone. It's a movie to buy, because it just doesn't get old. (I'm replacin my 10-year-old copy due to misplacement).

And did I mention the soundtrack? It rocks. If I could figure out how to bold things, it would ROCK in bold print. Okay, picture this bold-faced: ROCK!!

Rent, borrow, steal, or *gasp* buy this movie. Spread it among your friends like a bad cold or that thing your boyfriend swore he got cleared up. Make it the linchpin of your vampire film fest. This film deserves more than a small cult following, so get it, watch it, share it, repeat.",1336262400,2,2215,4.614213197969543

It's also worth noting that beneath all those wavy locks, Boya is a very fetching fellow.  Well written, no jarring bits of dialogue or clumsy scenes.  The best low-budget 90s film out of Canada I've ever seen.",1318377600,,357,5.103448275862069
802114,4,6304171781,"Boya: ""Each time you turn your back, a few more... gone, makes you want to withdraw.""
Molly: ""Yeah, well. You can't go through life afraid to connect because the thing might end, right?""
Boya: ""Not might.""

A likeable example of creative storytelling on a limited budget ($300,000), this is a unique, charming, low-gore, quirky little movie has managed to establish a small cult following since its release in 1995. Gordon Currie (perhaps best known for his performance as the Antichrist in Left Behind) plays Boya, the vampire who went into hibernation in 1969 after Neil Armstrong stepped down onto the moon.

Earl: ""So where you from?""
Boya: ""It's a long story.""
Earl: ""I've got all night.""
Boya: ""You'd need all night.""
Earl: ""Well I got all night.""

We don't ever really find out why it is that Boya was thrown into such a depression by the moon landing, but it is a nice historical moment to consider in regards to a man who always stays the same even as the world changes drastically around him. There are several allusions to the fact that Boya has had many lovers/partners, but we do not know if he stayed with them until their deaths, or if he has always, as with Rita, moved on before he could be too tempted.  Ann Rice (who had nothing to do with this project) dealt with this same topic in her vampire novels, namely the difficulty people have with adapting to an ever changing world and the culturally required paradigm shifts in thought that come with those changes.  If you don't understand that, you don't need to find a vampire, just ask anyone over 50, and they can explain it to you.

Awakened by a golf ball smashing through the window into the storage room where he has been hibernating, Boya crawls out of his sleeping bag into 1994 Toronto to face a grimy world of small-time mobsters, and cheap donuts.  The 60's night club Boya once haunted is now a donut shop.  Rita, a bitter ex-girlfriend (Fiona Reid of Haven) who mourns her lost beauty, resents the fact that Boya would not gift her with eternal youth.  She's been waiting 25 years for Boya's resurrection to make her point.  Determined not to prey on people, Boya runs through dozens of rats and pigeons while forming a somewhat sexually ambiguous friendship with a nervous cabbie who dreams of better things and owes money to all the wrong people.  Earl, the cabbie, (Louis Ferreira of Stargate Universe) is at once sweet and slimy, a strange mix of pathos and nuisance, rendered with an ersatz Christopher Walken cadence.  As Stephen, the crime boss, David Cronenberg again establishes his mastery of the dry sense of humor (playing a similar role to that in Nightbreed).

Stephen: ""Am I employing retards? I have nothing against retards in general, I just can't afford to employ them.""

Boya forges a new relationship with Molly, a smart, ironic donut waitress (Helen Clarkson), who appears to be Rita's replacement in this new decade.  Boya has such fundamental awkward sweetness and sincerity that he's impossible not to like.  Throughout the entire movie Boya is kind to those around him, but this is clearly a man who is doing a lot of thinking about whether or not this life is worth living. He spends much of his waking time pouring through a scrapbook filled with old photos of friends from past decades and soaking in a bathtub. Boya, like a lot of people who spend this much time in the tub, is in a rut. He won't allow himself to indulge in bloodlust (except against rats and pigeons), and shows reluctance to risk the heartbreak that he has learned is the inevitable ending of romance and friendship.  Boya fulfils his need for human contact and interaction in the subtle company of an all-night donut shop that carries the elusive kiwi-jelly donut.

Blood and Donuts was nominated in 1996 for the Genie Awards in 3 categories: Best Achievement in Costume Design, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Original Screenplay. My biggest complaint with this flawed diamond is that the quirk relationships that carry the film were not given the time to properly develop.  According to interviews, the producers focused on trimming the running time of the film and much of the character development ended up on the cutting room floor.  Unfortunate decision since this was not a plot driven film.

Much like the quirky and elusive kiwi-jelly donut, Blood and Donuts was not a runaway hit, and since it's release it can be hard to find; but nevertheless it has managed to develop a bit of a cult following.  It's a classic cult vampire film, that has to be seen to be believed!",1312070400,12,4586,4.713391739674593
802115,5,6304171781,"They say that there is nothing new under the sun, that everything is simply a retread of ideas that have gone before, just the same old thing merely dressed up in different clothes and coiffed appropriately to meet a younger generation's standards. Well I'm here to tell you that just ain't true because I am the proud owner of a 13 year old vampire film from Canada that even if these post Lestat, post Buffy days still brings to the table an impressive amount of intelligence, wit, style, humor, and grace. It bears the unlikely title BLOOD AND DONUTS, and it has made of me a true believer in the existence of creative filmmakers. Yes, Virginia, they still exist! Even today this film still feels fresh..

The film begins with footage of the lunar landing in 1969--that's when Boya decided to crawl into a burlap bag and go to sleep for what turned out to be 25 years. He is only awakened by chance when a freak accident involving an errant golf ball during the film's openning credits sets off a chain of events in his lair that would have made Rube Goldberg proud. His awakening is immediately sensed by a beautician named Rita who bears the slight marks of his fangs on her neck. After Boya gets the considerable kinks out of his assorted body parts that 25 years in a burlap sack tend to leave one with, he sets off carrying a shovel--looking for food perhaps? He catches a ride to the Westview Cemetery with a cabbie named Earl, a garrulous but likeable fellow who can't help but notice his passenger's tears and, wanting to make him feel better, says he could never trust a man who couldn't cry and then launches into a long sad story about his dearly departed dog. But Boya's left the cab and has sought out a particular grave to excavate. What, or perhaps who, is buried there? A long lost lover to re-animate possibly? Nope, just his personal belongings which include the prerequiste sharp leather coat and an album full of old photographs to which he tenderly adds another, a picture of a pretty blond, using his own blood as an adhesive.

You're probably wondering how the donuts enter into the film about now, right? Well after Boya finds himself a place to crash, a seedy hotel with an ample supply of rats in the walls, he ventures out again looking for an all-night market where he might buy some very fresh liver. But alas the neighborhood has really changed and he's hopelessly lost. He drops into the donut shop for directions and instantly becomes entranced by young Molly who works the counter. The donut shop is a haven of sorts in this very shabby neighborhood. Its owner believes that everyone deserves the right to be able to eat a donut and have a safe place to eat it in. While he sits in the shop staring at her, Earl the cabbie comes in, he's desperately tring to avoid some thugs who have been after him but they just happen to catch up with him while Boya is there which is bad news for them. After the beat down, Boya offers his room as a sanctuary to Earl, and Earl gladly accepts, although after awhile he starts to regret that decision as he begins to notice some rather strange things about his host. His habit of sleeping in the closet during the day seemed odd in retrospect, but it was that big gaping wound in Boya's chest that didn't seem to faze him at all that really upset Earl.

I'm not going to do much more in the way of a plot synopsis here simply because I don't want to spoil a moment of this film for anyone who has the curiosity to go out and hunt it down. Its very special. You've already met all of the primary characters with the exception of the ""Crime Boss"" who is played by David Cronenberg in a thoroughly delightful cameo role. And doing a plot synopsis would never do this film justice anyhow. Oh, you'd know the story, but that's all. Its a fairly original story too. I could also spill my guts and tell you all the many reasons why this film is so special and give you examples, but again, then you wouldn't need to see the film would you? Let's see if I can talk about it and NOT give anything away.

There is very little violence in this film, which considering Cronenberg is rumored to have had a hand either in backing it or in otherwise supporting it, is interesting. What violence there is comes primarily at the film's end. The sex scene is conducted with the paticipants being in two different buildings and its the guy who is in the bathtub and the chick who is fully clothed. The vampire transformation is extremely well done and perfects the technique and style used in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and does it even slicker--however, it is only used twice. There is only one death in the entire film. Having said all of this I just realized that I have turned off every single member of this film's potential audience. Oops.

But for those of us who know that there can be more to a genre film than sex and violence (if only for a change of pace every now and then) BLOOD AND DONUTS offers the perfect alternative. For starters its an extremely well written film. Andrew Rai Berzins has given us fully realized, flesh and blood human beings (even the undead ones) that we can actually care about and empathize with and laugh WITH rather than AT. Released in 1995, BLOOD AND DONUTS went on to be nominated for Best Screenplay in the Genie Awards, Canada's equivalent of the Oscars, which is quite a testimonial for any low budget horror film. Director Holly Dale has also managed quite a feat, she's taken what in lesser hands might have been a genre film awkwardly attempting to be something else and turned it into a film that managed to succeed on both levels completely. The talented cast helps out enormously with Gordon Currie as the enigmatic/romantic Boya doing most of the heavy lifting with a graceful, comedic ease. Everyone else is also worthy of mention; Justin Louis as the cabbie, Helene Clarkson as the less than glamorous Molly, and Fiona Reid as the wannabe vampire Rita. Photography and lighting are moody but not murky, and once again I must comment on the music, something I rarely do. In addition to the regular score which is effective, they've chosen old pop songs such as ""Twilight Time"" by the Platters, ""I Put a Spell On You"" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as versions of ""Mr. Sandman"" and ""Blue Moon"" all of which add enormously to the film even though none of them dates to the era when Boya crawled into his burlap sack.

Do yourself a favor. If you like something a bit off the beaten track, if you don't mind a virtually bloodless vampire film, if films like FIDO strike you as something the world really needs more of, track down a copy of BLOOD AND DONUTS. And sit through the credits for one final scene.",1222473600,12,6713,4.480392156862745

Once I realized it was a vampire movie I rented it. It was so different from all the ""typical"" vampire movies. You couldn't help but really like Boya the vampire. Although no longer human he maintained his human qualities of compassion. He befriends a ""cutely-stupid"" cabby whose character I fell in love with right away especially when he realizes his new roommate is a vampire. I wasn't crazy about the waitress that Boya decides to make love to via ""vampiric telepathy"" (love that bath scene)! I warmed up to her only at the end of the movie when she finally lets her compassion for her friends show through. The end was sad but again it shows the human side of Boya.

7863909,4,6304171781,"Dry humor, an offbeat plot, good acting, and a bit of the Cronenberg (who is in the film) twisted touch all come together to make this an intriguing film worth seeing. A vampire wakes after being in a suspended state for more than 20 years, finds himself gravitating toward a late-night doughnut shop and the waitress/cashier who takes him at face value and is kind to him. In the meantime, his psycho ex-girlfriend is out to get him. Like the idea of a vampire who is likeable? If so, you'll like this film. I didn't know quite what to expect, but I enjoyed it and ended up buying a copy for myself.",1409356800,,600,4.366071428571429
