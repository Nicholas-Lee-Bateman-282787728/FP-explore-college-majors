However, the film itself is great and must be seen to be believed!
Again, I'm not impressed about the burned disk and this should not be allowed on amazon without warning.",1372809600,,239,4.454545454545454
8278840,1,B001AQZBBQ,"I can't say I've seen this. I've tried to watch it twice but the subtitles are horrid! The font is skinny and the type is so small that it is difficult to read. Not to mention that they go flying by before you can finish reading it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Asian movies and have quite a collection going and for the most part they are great. But this is the first one where I had difficulty reading the subtitles. And I couldn't figure out why they had the subtitles both in Japanese (or whatever it was) AND English. I mean if you can understand what they are saying, WHY would you need to read it too? All in all, I was very dissappointed with this. I will give it a few more tries but after that I will ask Amazon if I can return it.",1248393600,4,739,4.0
8278841,3,B001AQZBBQ,"It's okay. Pretty good couple of gory scenes but plot was pretty out there. I also didn't like the fact it wasn't in english. It's hard to watch movie and read words at the same time. Overall,it was watchable and centipedes were creepy. James.",1238371200,3,243,4.545454545454546
