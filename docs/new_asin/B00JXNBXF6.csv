8654521,5,B00JXNBXF6,An enjoyable series of a time gone by. Hoping a 4th release comes out as there are quite a few episodes that were on the video release many years ago not yet been transferred to DVD. Only disspointed that a bit more thought hadn't gone into releasing the episodes in chronological order of the airdates and a little bit of restoration...,1493596800,2,337,4.540983606557377

8654524,5,B00JXNBXF6,I have been a fan of Joan Davis for so many years. Love her comedy. I grew up watching her in many movies - my favorite was Hold That Ghost with Abbott and Costello. The combination of these three great comedians was the ultimate comedic enjoyment. I am so happy with the I Married Joan collection I purchased from Amazon.,1453852800,4,322,4.383333333333334
