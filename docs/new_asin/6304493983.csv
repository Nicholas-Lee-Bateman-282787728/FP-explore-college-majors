920028,4,6304493983,"I am not a big fan of so called ""B"" movies, but after reading the other reviews I decided to take a chance on this one (I have spent more than 2.99 on rental films from other unnamed companies and have been disappointed).  I must say that I enjoyed it.  If you are still undecided, then maybe I can clarify a few things.  This is a comedy and there are different types of comedies.  If you like the sophisticated intellectual comedy of Woody Allen then this is not the film for you.  BUT, if (like me) you enjoy the classic Montey Python style of smart slapstick humour mixed with National Lampoon's love of pretty young women in various stages of undress (without exaggeration), then you should find this very entertaining.  Dispite what others have written here the story line is quite coherent (if you pay attention) and there are some very smart and cute jokes (i.e. one catgirl's description of the behavior of men).  So if you enjoy smart slapstick humour I think you will enjoy this film.",1264377600,,995,4.556179775280899

920030,2,6304493983,"Alot of Troma movies are out of print and its hard to find them at a good price. Teenage Catgirls in Heat is one of those movies and it hovers around the 40 dollars for a copy of the movie. Dont worry, your not missing too much. The movie is hard to see because its dark most of the movie and so what if there are naked girls. There is alot of better looking naked girls in other Troma films. All in all, a disappointment and im glad I didn't pay 40 bucks for this.",1200355200,2,465,3.905263157894737
920031,4,6304493983,"This movie was originally called (somewhat more modestly) simply ""Catgirls,"" but once the friendly folks at Troma got a hold of it, it morphed into ""Teenage Catgirls in Heat,"" which is actually a more descriptive title.  This little gem was made in Austin, Texas and concerns itself with a bunch of housecats that commit ritual suicide under the direction of an ancient Egyptian cat goddess. The cats then magically become women who wander around scantily clad plotting a nefarious world conquest scheme so stupid I am not even going to go into it here (hint: it involves the coming of ""the Great Litter."") As an aside, watching the catgirls play with string, meow, and chase mice is all well and good, but the director also likes them to use kitchen utensils in hostile encounters. (Watch for the potato masher and ice cream scoop in action.)

There are two heroes of the film (one of which turns out to be one quarter cat on his maternal grandmother's side...don't ask) who uncover the plot, and with the help of one particularly helpful feline girl, Cleo (yes, like Cleopatra...,) a Brahma bull, and a very unusual bit of romance (there is unforgettable dialogue here, asking if the catgirl has been spayed), the plot is foiled. You may actually wish it hadn't been, though, when you see the headpiece that our hero, Warren, has to wear after dealing with a tiger. (This thing would have shamed Bootsy Collins even in the 1970s.)

This whole thing is extremely silly and low budget, with much of the film in shot day-for-night (resulting in everything being a lovely shade of blue), and special effects being no more than close-ups of actual cats and stuffed toys flung from roofs (for the ritual feline suicides.) I was especially enthralled in when Warren got to interrogate a domestic housecat using unethical methods involving a garbage can, catnip, and feline hypnosis.

The movie is entertaining in a campy way, but is not suitable for younger viewers due to the scanty catgirl attire. The extras are extremely lame by Troma's standards: the commentary track is somewhat annoying and not all that enlightening and the additional features (especially the sequel shtick) vary from very lame to atrocious. All told, I thought this was one of the best Troma films (though it's not gory, unless you count the scratching and hissing) and I recommend it to lovers of campy, but fun, bad movies.",1154908800,5,2396,4.8508557457212715
920032,1,6304493983,"I'm a lover of bad movies, but this one isn't loveable at all.  It's just extremely amateurish, low budget, and has nothing of interest.  The plot is about an ancient egyptian statue of a cat that's been locked away in a suitcase for some time.  It comes to life (well, they show a picture of it and do a voiceover), and it tells all the cats in the area to commit suicide.  Then they are reborn as women who walk around and do extremely corny immitations of cats.  There are a couple of bumbling cat hunters who are trying to unravel this ""mystery"", but most of the middle part of the movie is spent with one of the cat hunters getting ready to go on a date with one of the catgirls.  She meows and holds her hands up as if they were paws, etc.  This must take an hour.  It's an 80 minute movie but seems to drag on for at least two and a half hours.  For some reason most of the movie is filmed through a blue filter.  Maybe this was to give it an ""eerie"" look?  It just makes it look like it was filmed through a blue filter.  The ending is just ridiculous - it's as if they got to the end of the movie and were completely out of money, and even more completely out of ideas, so somebody came up with a really really dumb idea and they just filmed it.

Overall, there are so many good B movies out there, why watch one that is as awful as this?",1107475200,6,1347,4.0
920033,3,6304493983,"I was totally unaware until I bought this movie that the B movie industry is alive and well in today's culture.
The story's kinda hard to follow in the beginning, but it comes around.  Obviously this is a B movie so there are no big names and the acting isn't great.  Plus the story is so convaluted with T&A that I found myself wondering how they could work so much into the script.  The one supporting actor is a riot.  He's a rogue cat hunter.  He hunts stray cats.  Wow.  Wanna laugh?  Pick this one up.  It'll sit on the shelf for a while after you watch it once.",1037232000,9,568,4.137614678899083
920034,2,6304493983,"The DVD was a lot better than the movie it contained. The movie could have been soooo much better (more of the girls would have been a good start), but the extra's almost made up for the price. There's previews and tours of Troma studio's and photo galleries and clips. There's also not much else I can add.",1015200000,3,307,4.310344827586207
920035,3,6304493983,"Cats are turned into seductive women stalking the men about town. Only after kitty plays, she kills. It was all right.  But, I prefer the story  and cat-like portrayal in ""TOMCAT: Dangerous Desires"" with  Richard Grieco.--that's terrific.",967161600,2,238,5.378378378378378
920036,4,6304493983,"I was not expecting this movie to be as enjoyable as it was. Granted, it does not look good, and the day-for-night shots are particularly bad. Once we get past these problems, though, we find a very amusing story. The plot  involves an Egyptian cat goddess who transforms normal cats into Teenage  Catgirls, who are In Heat, of course. There are a number of surprises  before it's all done. This is one that I would recommend, especially to my  fellow Texans.",963100800,10,459,4.62962962962963

7876672,1,6304493983,"Some time ago I made a comment on an online forum that I felt annoyed and depressed at the complete lack of intelligent and readily available horror reading material. Recently I have been pleasantly surprised to discover such gems as ""The Concrete Grove"" by Gary McMahon and the ultimate werewolf tail (little play on words !) High Moor by Graeme Reynolds a new and rising star in this genre...so belief and a smile are slowly returning to my face.

After some difficulty I was successful in securing a copy of ""The Wolfen"" by Whitley Strieber and am so pleased that I did. In essence The Wolfen is a story of man and Canis Lupus Sapiens or more commonly referred to as the Werewolf trying to eke out a living and cohabit in an overcrowded world and a world that refuses to acknowledge it's existence. Two policemen are murdered whilst carrying out routine duties at a car pound in a district of New York, and the investigating officers Rebecca Neff and George Wilson are tasked with bringing the perpetrators to justice. Wilson and Neff soon discover that this is not a simple case and suspicion soon falls on the Werewolf, The Wolfen as named in the book. The story evolves with a great list of characters and a cracking storyline that never relaxes. It soon becomes clear that The Wolfen pack are themselves hunting Wilson and Neff, as the knowledge these two officers now possess concerning the existence of The Wolfen, threatens the werewolf community and way of life....the hunters have become the hunted!! The chief of police Underwood is only interested in his promotion to Commissionaire and refuses to accept that a pack of Werewolf's are living and running amok in his city, and are responsible for the death of two of his officers. Carl Ferguson the curator of the Natural History Museum is haunted by the possibility of an imminent Werewolf attack and in one particularly tense scene he is walking the museum late at night and is deeply troubled and frightened by every sound the building exudes. This tension and fear prevailing throughout the book draws the reader in and creates a great sense of unease. The Wolfen is a silent predator who can destroy his prey efficiently and with clockwork precision. To understand the mind of The Wolfen it must be appreciated they only really attack to satisfy their hunger and they view man as a means to exist and a good source of nourishment. They are also selective in their choice of victim,(the murder of the two policemen was a mistake) and choose to kill only those who they see as weak and who live in the fringes. They kill with ruthless and silent efficiency and it is this ability that totally immerses the reader in a nightmare reading experience! The brutal strength and beauty of The Wolfen is best described in one memorable scene from the book......

""Now she was down, she was pushing her nose past cloth, slick hot flesh, feeling the vibration of subvocal response in the man, feeling his muscles stiffening as his body reacted to her standing on it, then opening her mouth against the flesh, feeling her teeth scrape back and down, pressing her tongue against the deliciously salty skin and ripping with all the strength in her jaws and neck and chest, and jumping back to the wall with the bloody throat in her mouth. The body on the bench barely rustled as its dying blood poured out....Now her job was over,she dropped behind the wall and ate her trophy. It was rich and sweet with blood. Around her the pack was very happy as it worked....Then the pack ate in rank order. The mother took the brain. The father took a thigh and buttock. The first mated pair ate the clean organs. When they returned from their duty the second mated pair took the rest. And then they pulled apart the remains and took them piece by piece and dropped them in the nearby lake...When this was done, they went to a place they had been earlier, a great meadow full of the beautiful new snow that had been falling. They ran and danced in the snow, feeling the pleasure of their bodies, the joy or facing headlong across the wide expanse, and because they knew that no human was in earshot they had a joyous howl full of the pulsing rhythm they liked best after a hunt.....

Neff has a difficult home life and a complicated working relationship with Wilson, however they must lay aside these differences to keep focused and avoid being consumed by The Wolfen. The chase becomes a game of cat and mouse and a marvellous experience for the reader as the tension never relaxes and we rush towards a bloody conclusion. This is not merely a horror story but the portrayal of a misunderstood group trying to exist and survive in the shadows of the city and avoid the wrath of man....I strongly recommend!",1384732800,,4749,4.644470868014269

7876675,5,6304493983,"I first saw the movie, ""Teenage Catgirls in Heat"" on Cinemax in the 90's. I am one of those people who has Animal Control on speed dial and carries pet supplies in my truck so for me to endorse this movie is a sign. It might be a sign that I have a PROFOUNDLY f***ed up sense of humor or ""Eraserhead"" has been surpassed in bizarre-o movie world. Maybe The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography however nothing this cheaply produced can match the hilarity of this script.
I still think it was filmed in GA/SC but I'll give ya South Texas. Let me also say I was sober when I first saw it. I let my then 10 & 12 year old girls watch it because it was so stupid funny. Our last cat was named Keshra...she only drank running water.",1354320000,,734,4.176056338028169
