5923803,4,B00EJU9GQ6,"Was a really good movie. More of a love story about Winnie and Nelson. Terrence Howard was AWESOME as Nelson. Sounded just like him. Jennifer did just okay. I think if she didn't have to have the accent, and played an American woman, then she would've been great but she struggled with the accent, so most times it sounded like she was reading straight from the script as she was trying to get the accent. It just didn't work for her. Overall, the story line was ok, they left out a lot, so so you could tell some things were missing from the story, so the movie needed to be a little longer.",1386892800,,592,4.247787610619469

5923806,5,B00EJU9GQ6,"I had no idea of Winnie Mandela's complete story.  It was something that will haunt me forever.  Jennifer  Hudson is an amazing actor.  I have a Mandela movie that touches on her life, but this was a real eye opener.  I've watched three times.  Each time I realize I  missed something on a previous viewing.  Terrance Howard is also excellent.  I have two other Mandela movies and each of the actors who have played Mandela and Winnie are very different, but excellent.  Writing this  review is a pleasure.",1386633600,,506,4.636363636363637
5923807,5,B00EJU9GQ6,"I told myself that I was not going to watch any more of these Racism or Anti-racism movies, and then I just Watched Winnie Mandela well played by Jennifer Hudson...  What a movie!  What a strong woman.
Makes you wonder, ""Was Winnie Mandela ultimately betrayed by her husband Nelson after all her hard years of struggle while he was in prison, or was she the ultimate 'Collateral Damage"" of this Anti-Apartheid war?""
Maybe there's a whole lot more to this story than we know.",1386374400,,474,4.630952380952381
5923808,4,B00EJU9GQ6,"This is an interesting film which shows the complexity of the character of Winnie Mandela. Once Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, Winnie took over the movement, crossing the line and doing things, for better or worse, that Nelson wouldn't dare do. One can debate if her militant stance helped or hurt the liberation of South Africa, but it was after decades of peaceful measures failing that lead to a more radical approach.

The film contains the expected grand speeches, self sacrifice, tear jerking moments with appropriate sound track. It leaves criticism of Winnie up to the audience.  I felt the acting, which was good, needed to be taken up a notch as it seemed to lack a degree of expected passion. There also seems to be a disconnect between the effect of the movement, world pressure, and the decision to free Mandela and end apartheid which would normally climax a film. Even as the film was about her, these events which she dedicated her life to should have been better presented.

Worth viewing.

5923809,4,B00EJU9GQ6,"""She spent nearly 500 days in prison, 400 of them alone in solitary. She was exiled, they harassed her, they nearly killed her. Her contribution to the struggle is beyond calculation."" This movie follows the life of Winnie (Hudson) from birth to her life with husband Nelson Mandela (Howard) and beyond. It shows her transformation from shy student to activist. I hate to admit it but I knew next to nothing about this woman before I started the movie. For that reason going in my first thought was, why make a movie about her when Nelson is much more interesting. After watching this my thoughts changed to why don't they make more movies about her. I'm not sure how accurate this movie is but I found it to be very interesting and really made me feel for her. Seeing a woman who was shy and had her life ahead of her end up being broken by seeing the way her life was affected by her husbands sentence gives you conflicting emotions. On one hand you want her to do the things she is doing while at the same time you know she should stop. The end of the movie is so bittersweet that it's hard to feel happy about what happened. The only really bad thing I have to say about this is that it really had the feel of a Lifetime movie. Overall, my feelings went from why a movie about her to why aren't there more movies about her. I highly recommend this. I give it an A-.",1385424000,28,1369,4.269230769230769
5923810,4,B00EJU9GQ6,"I'm in love with Jennifer Hudson, but saw this with expectations greatly lowered following the film's long time on the shelf, hostility from Winnie Mandela and her camp, and the poor reviews.

...And was surprised, righteously, more than pleasantly (owing to the subject matter):  it's a fine film, much superior to the ""TV-movie quality"" some reviewers damned it for.  There's a lot in it that simply never gets seen or heard in this country's entertainment media:  the sights and sounds, accents, backgrounds, habits, assumptions, of a very foreign country, starting decades ago under a radical forced separation of blacks and whites, by the whites, in the blacks' own ancestral homeland, backed up with brutal state power.  Winnie suffers in solitary confinement for months, growing slightly unhinged but never backing down from fierce resistance.  The world knows this story, and the shocking lengths she and/or her camp went to defending against the state security agencies and their informers.  Winnie is never fully understood, and may not be fully understandable; but the film confronts the paradoxes, suggesting explanations, after a marvelous beginning, with Winnie enjoying her life and friends and opportunities; taking a sharp turn after being romanced by the bold idealist Nelson Mandela, giving her all for him and his movement (which didn't turn violent until the state crackdown did, when blacks could not legally become political actors, much less voters; and were relegated to the least productive, and most resource-poor ""homelands"" reserved for them without their consent).  In the end [SPOILER ALERT], her sacrifice wins much less than she'd hoped, as the controversy over her own camp's brutalities persuades Nelson to divorce her publicly.  After nearly three decades forced apart, she could not share or savor the triumph of the movement and the transformation of a major continental power.

Terrance Howard is superb as Mandela, nailing Mandela's accent down to its subtleties, acing a long Swahili monologue, projecting both passionate leadership and cerebral composure in the worst circumstances (the Sharpeville massacre)...while Jennifer gives a beautiful, deeply-felt performance as Winnie, whether glamorized for publicity, sweet in her student innocence, steely in the faces of wickedly harsh police, or wide-eyed and joyous (!) when, with a possibly weakening grip on reality, or adjusting as best she can, she sings to the ants in her prison cell.

I won't mention the cumulative effect of a hundred gorgeous close-ups of Ms. Hudson on this besotted fan.",1384732800,4,2589,5.41542288557214
5923811,4,B00EJU9GQ6,"We see a lot about the great leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr.; Malcolm X; Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela but have you ever thought about the impact their vision and legacy have on the lives of their wives and children?  Winnie (played by Jennifer Hudson) was a strong force from birth as the story journeys her life, you can see that she was truly the one primed for the position in being the wife of Nelson Mandela (played by Terrance Howard). In the story, Winnie Mandela, you see the challenges that Winne went through from being in jail for over a year, where she was tortured; and placed on house arrest where she was harassed to being abruptly exiled because the African government saw her as a threat.  Despite Nelson being imprisoned for over 27 years, Winnie kept the vision alive but at the risk of her own life and that of her children.  She ran into some trouble when she was accused of having a teenager, James Seipei (also known as Stompie Moeketsi) abducted and killed, along with other legal and criminal troubles, this news was received by Nelson in prison. Later, it was decided by the government that apartheid could be healed and ended by having Nelson as the South African President but with one catch, Winnie would not be allowed to be the First Lady.

I was so amazed and grateful that I was able to glean into the life of Winnie Mandela (aka Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela) which means blessed peace.  I often wondered why after 27 years that Winne and Nelson were no longer a team because on the outside looking in it appears that they were a strong unit.  Sad that something like these occurrences caused such a great pair to become somewhat at odds in the end.",1456531200,,1702,4.545751633986928

She does a decent job in her performance as Winnie Mandela and it was interesting to see Winnie's side of the story being told.

went through while being isolated for months in the local jail.  Forcing her not to bath and to wear the same nightgown she
had on when she was arrested, will break your heart.  What she did to keep her sanity is amazing.  The police did not break
her.  Instead the female jailer who was forced to abuse her went into a screaming rage.  Understood.  One would need to be
a sadist in order to perpetrate such inhumane treatment on another human being.  People should not miss Hudson's performance.

5923877,4,B00EJU9GQ6,I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to learn the historical foundation that made Winnie Mandela what she is to today. Although Mrs mandela took a wrong path I feel it was her harsh treatment in solitary confinement for 18 months that head a strong bearing on her controversial actions and not wanting to comply with the African national Congress. I feel Mr. Terence Howard's performance of nelson mandela was superb and heartfelt. I felt that jennifer Hudson's role as Winnie was very good but could have been better.,1389484800,,537,4.8478260869565215

No one and I mean no one should have to through something like this, they were two strong people.
Check it out.",1389312000,,210,3.4893617021276597
5923880,5,B00EJU9GQ6,"My expectations were low and I didn't think Jennifer Hudson could pull it off. But I've never been so wrong about a movie. Not only did she pull it off, she was excellent. Her and Terrance Howard together were great.
Future generations may doubt that human beings like this actually lived. Winnie Mandela gave so much to the struggle and the struggle relentlessly took so much from her. She was not the First Lady of South Africa but she is the mother of the South African Revolution. I love this movie.",1388966400,2,503,4.538461538461538
5923881,5,B00EJU9GQ6,"This was a very moving movie to say the least! I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Terrance &Jennifer's acting was totally awesome,especially Jennifer Hudson,I would go far as to say Academy Award worthy,definitely.",1388966400,,214,5.71875

5923883,4,B00EJU9GQ6,"After watching movie ""Winnie Mandela"", I wondered how much Winnie, the main character, consulted on this movie about herself. Winnie was referred to as the Mother of the Nation, she was statues and beautiful, very intelligent and warrior spirited. Yet so much was left out about her diplomacy, about how she traveled around the world from country to country to gain world support for the release of her husband Nelson Mandela. The greatness of the woman was laminated to half her greatness in this movie. I remember when Winnie came to United States to appeal to the world and enlightened us of the term apartheid and unjust imprisonment of South Africans under apartheid regime. People were naming their children after Winnie and Nelson because of her image, which I must mention was calculatedly distained. The population of South Africa including Nelson are under the influence of apartheid also Stokholm AND Helsinki syndromes.
Jennifer Hudson is believable in her role of Winnie, her acting is very good.
I am looking forward to a better or the new version about Winnie, ""Long Walk"" and hope this newer version has the reality of her heroic roles in helping to free South Africa of apartheid.",1388793600,,1197,4.960199004975125
5923884,5,B00EJU9GQ6,"I wactched this movie on a whem....I just really wanted to see something different and inspiring and Lets face it when i saw that Terrence Howard and Jennifer Hudson were in it I was pretty much sold. I LOVED the 2 of them in this movie.....They both Portrayed the characters better than anything. From the time that Winnie was a little girl, she knew that she wanted to be strong and stand for  something. Her break out from a shy young lady to a powerful and inspiring individual was very Moving. Even the Love that Winnie and Nelson showed even when they were denied the ability to even see each other made you develop a loving emotion. The controversy makes you wonder what was correct about the lives of the couple and what was incorrect. I WOULD recommenfd this movie to other people especially if history is something that interests them.",1388448000,,845,4.596026490066225

I read the book it was based on some years ago, and having been a political prisoner myself, could easily relate to Winnie Mandela ""The Mother of the Revolution""!!! Amandla!!!  I just finished watching A Long Walk to Freedom.  Now I understand why Winnie Mandela""s movie received very little publicity, and very harsh reviews! I strongly recommend that folks compare the two, draw their own conclusions, and ignore the so-called movie critics.",1387238400,2,538,5.079545454545454

Clearly she was an amazing women who fought hard for equal rights despite being granted many opportunities to walk away but she stayed and fought for the people of South Africa and remained by her husband's side until the end. She's my new ""Shero"". Both Terrance Howard and Jennifer Hudson did an excellent job portraying Mandela and Winnie Mandela. A must watch.
