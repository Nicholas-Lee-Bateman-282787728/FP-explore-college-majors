But with the show coming to an end, I am hoping they will come out with everything all on one boxed set. That would be worth waiting for.
But if you need them now, this purchase would be your best bet.",1078444800,7,346,3.7534246575342465

8006219,5,B00014CM3S,"FRIENDS is a sitcom based on six friends. I was first introduced by one of my teachers and have been watching it ever since. You will fall in love with each character...particularly Joey is a scream...and each one finds a place in your heart.  This show has you rolling on the floor as the years blow from season 1 through 8.

Enjoy.",1100476800,2,333,4.354838709677419
8006220,3,B00014CM3S,"This is my most favorite sitcom. I do not usually like comedy but this one suits me very well. I can see why some people wouldn't like it. However, it fits my personality very well.
 In a way Monica, Rachel, Phoebe ( the girls. ) Ross, Chandler, and Joe ( the guys. ) Have a yin and yang relationship to each other.
 Some times the story lines do get dull and they really are dragged out. However, on a whole this is one of my favorite series.
 Really good comedy for most of the seasons.",1083024000,,488,4.11578947368421
8006221,1,B00014CM3S,"...some people will buy any piece of junk.  Think of it.  6 seasons of insipid jokes by a bunch of excessively overpaid and under-talented actors playing people who you wouldn't want to be caught dead on the same continent with-- let alone in the same apartment!  On the other hand, the one saving grace is that this is not a reality show---in fact, it's as far from anything involving real people as you can get.
This is the ""best comedy"" ever made?  Boy, has the American public's taste sunk!!!",1080259200,6,496,4.53932584269663
8006222,1,B00014CM3S,"What is wrong with you people?  Am I the only person out there that would rather be shot in the face than watch an episode of ""Friends""?  This is NOT a great show. ""Friends"" is a show full of people that the human race should NOT by any means try to aspire to being.  This show centers around a group of complete and total morons who make completele and total morons out of themselves on a daily basis.  Every episode is based on the stupidity of them.  One or more of them screws something up horribly and the rest of the episode is the rest of them trying to patch up the problem that never would have occurred in the first place if they all weren't walking wastes of space.
Even so, it's still possible to have a funny show that centers around total morons.  However, the writers couldn't acheive this to save their lives.  This show is about as amusing as a fire in an orphanage.  The jokes are not funny.  They're all corny puns or weak slapstick humor that goes nowhere and is EASILY predictable by even the biggest bonehead in the audience.  They may as well dedicate an entire show to telling ""Yo momma"" jokes because they are much more amusing than this show could ever be.
I have never once watched an episode of this show that didn't make me want to bounce my face off of a telephone pole.  That's why I've decided to design a basic plot for an episode that would completely and totally rule.  The entire cast of ""Friends"" are out being stupid again when they decide, HEY!  What better way to spend an evening than by downing an entire bottle of moonshine?  Well, being the morons that they are, they think that this is a brilliant idea.  After getting fully loaded with pure alcohol, the entire cast of ""Friends"" are stumbling along an empty highway in the middle of the night.  They're too drunk to drive so they have to walk across the street.  Then out of nowhere, an out of control bus full of crazed nuns comes flying down the street at 125 miles per hour.  The nuns see the cast of morons slowly dragging themselves across the street, so the nun busdriver decides to slam on her brakes.  WHOOPS!  The bus spins 90 degrees!  The entire side of the bus slams into the entire cast of ""Friends"", then topples over, instantly crushing everyone.
The reason why this episode would rule so much is because the show would have to be cancelled because the entire cast was dead.  Basically, if you're going to waste your money on something , spend your $160+ dollars on something worth a lot more than this terrible DVD collection, like a years supply of gum or an economy size bag of Jolly Ranchers. Anything is better than this DVD set.  Stick to good shows like The Simpsons, Seinfeld, Futurama, and The Family Guy.  You'll be much happier if you do.",1080172800,,2760,4.41980198019802
8006223,5,B00014CM3S,"This is a must-have for all fans, and a great opportunity to know the show if you never saw them on TV (It's a pitty it's over). If you ever have a bad day and are needed for some laughs and a relax time, and you are completely alone, these guys know how to cheer you up and recover the smile in your face!!",1079654400,,307,3.8125
