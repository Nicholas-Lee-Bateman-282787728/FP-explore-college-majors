857475,3,6304375239,"The wealth of glowing reviews currently sitting atop Judgment Night's Amazon page are likely to set the bar just a bit higher than this film can manage for a first-time viewer.  It's not a terrible movie at all, and it does contain its share of laughs and quotable lines, but in the end it's really just another cookie-cutter early 90s action/""suspense"" flick.  All of the usual stereotypes are checked off among the mostly one-dimensional characters, inner city streets are scary and devoid of people at night (unless a few people are required to advance the plot), the big bad guy is so bad that he'll kill a henchman for a bit of peace and quiet, etc., etc.  A very good cast does what they can to make it watchable, and mostly succeed, but in truth there are only two note-worthy reasons to check this one out:

First, Denis Leary steals the show as the aforementioned bad guy.  Leary is clearly giving his all in one of his first major acting roles, and despite the hackneyed script it is his Fallon character that you will remember weeks or months later when something jogs your memory of this film, and it is his lines you'll find yourself quoting should you ever end up reminiscing with somebody else who sat through it.  Jeremy Piven gives a decent enough effort as Ray Cochran and Cuba Gooding Jr. is as solid as ever in his portrayal of Mike Peterson, but neither is reason enough to press play on this one.

The second reason to take a closer look at Judgment Night would be the groundbreaking soundtrack.  Put together well before bands like Korn burst into the mainstream to popularize ""nu-metal"", each track features collaborations between some of the biggest hard rock and rap acts of the day: metal pioneers Slayer performing with Ice T, Pearl Jam with Cypress Hill, and Helmet paired with House of Pain (rapper Everlast has a supporting role in the film as well) to name a few, with my personal favorite off the disc being the pairing of Faith No More with Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. (""Another Body Murdered"").  Even if you opt out of the film itself, give the official soundtrack a listen if either of those musical genres appeals to you.",1487462400,,2149,4.63421052631579

857558,5,6304375239,Judgment Night is one of my favorite thrillers. Its shockingly underrated and forgotten for some reason. The performances are great with Denis Leary giving a truly psychotic performance that goes way against type for him. He`s perfect. Emilio Estevez is great as well and they make a terrific mano e mano. Estevez is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood history with a great film catalog. The movie is very suspenseful and the locations it was filmed in are perfect. If you like thrillers there`s no reason I can think of that you won`t dig this exciting thriller. It needs a proper blu ray already.,1464480000,,609,4.754716981132075

857753,5,6304375239,"Great flick.

You either love this movie, or you hate this movie.  Me?  I love it.  I saw it years ago and it has always stuck in my mind.

Denis Leary is a pretty foul mouthed drug dealer that just wants to kill Emilo and his boys.

Four guys go out for a night out to catch a boxing match, but end up taking the wrong exit.  Believing they have hit a person, the four try to get help, only to find Leary is one ruthless, cold-blooded killer.  The guys witness a murder and now they are running for their lives, from a mob of maniacs.

Leary gives a great performance with his 'f-bomb' riddled lines, tough Irish attitude and murderous intentions.

Emilo, now graduated from the Brat Pack, has come into his own.  He carries the hero role better than I thought he would, but still couldn't be an action star.  He stays level headed throughout, and even knocks some sense into his best friend and little brother.

Cuba.  I'm not a fan of his.  His character is the sort of guy that hasn't been able to move past senior year in high school.  He starts off tough, but then all that falls to the weighside.  Which is weird.  In one scene he grabs a dude in an armbar and man-handles him, but after that, he turns into a coward.  Then wants to fight Emilo and Brad.  I know he is scared, but it just seems like his character is just written poorly.  Like they had about four versions of him and just said, to hell with it, combine all four.

Brad really didn't add anything to the movie.

Even though I bad mouthed some of the actors, this movie really is a good film.  Could it have been better?  Sure.  But it's a decent thriller, cat and mouse style film.  I like it.",1438992000,3,1666,4.2063492063492065
857754,5,6304375239,"I remember digging this with my brother. It has a cool cast and simple but solid premise. A group of buddies take a wrong turn on a night out of fun and come across some serious s*** and need to stay alive. We were also excited that Everlast was in it since we were big House of Pain fans at the time. Dennis Leary plays the main thug so how can you go wrong? The movie can be cliche but does have a few surprises. Poor Jeremy Piven... Shooting at night on location added tremendously to the movie for me as they got stuck in a raw, urban setting. I really miss these late night action thrillers from the era, it's all effects nowadys.",1437955200,,635,4.129032258064516

857884,4,6304375239,"Amazing Chi-town classic cinema. This is just a DVD (I couldn't find this movie in true Blu-Ray or HD).

If you don't already know the movie, I don't think you'd be amazed by it seeing it now. But this is a must own for anyone who loves 80's/90's cheese.

857960,4,6304375239,"1993 film where four old Chicago buddies rent a lavish motor home for a night of partying and watching boxing. After they witness a murder by Fallon, a sinister drug lord very well-played by Denis Leary, a long, tense, violent urban odyssey follows.

Though somewhat dated by its 20 years, JUDGMENT NIGHT is everything a thriller-seeker desires. The simple but focused plot follows the old formula, and it's fairly easy to predict the basics of how it will turn out, but it has plenty of small surprises along the way, and there's nothing too unbelievable. The four friends--one who turns out to be the big hero, one who keeps mucking everything up for everybody else, and two who are kind of in the middle--are a rather cookie-cutter set, but good acting and even better filming keep this film alive.

Interesting to see the young Stephen Dorff in an atypical role as the younger brother of the hero played by Emilio Estevez.",1398297600,,926,4.745341614906832

Dennis Leary - who plays the gang leader, is one of the most sinister bad guys i've ever seen on film and Emilio Estevez, Jeremy Piven & Cuba Gooding Jr. not only play convincing longtime buddies but really make you believe that these guys are in real danger of losing their lives at any moment. The movie is well directed by Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, 24 Season 1) & has some of the best lighting & sets that i've ever seen in a movie.

858287,4,6304375239,"Dont buy this if you haven't already seen it. Rent it first and then buy it if you like it. So if you have seen it you have probably made up your mind if you are going to add this collection or not already. But here is my 10 cents worth anyway.

The reason I ever saw this movie in the first place was for two reasons. a)the soundtrack which featured the top heavy metal and hip hop acts around at the time and fused them together. And b)Denis Leary, who I liked as a stand up comic and was curious to see him acting in a serious role playing your typical ""bad guy"" role.

I wasn't disappointed in either case. The music provides a great backdrop to the mood of the whole movie. And Denis was great in the role of Fallon, a drug-dealing no-nonsense bad guy  in control of a whole neighbourhood.

So I didn't hesitate to buy this when it was finally released on DVD. It was a good movie back in its day and still is today in my opinion. The all star cast is a bonus as well, although I am not a particular fan of Jeremy Piven, he was quite good in this role. Peter Greene is once again very appealing in his bad guy role as Fallons right hand man.

It definitely wasn't Emilio Esteves' best movie and I think Cuba Gooding Jnr was out of place as his best friend, but still a worthwhile purchase for any fans of theirs.

Special features include a trailer and that's it. Would have been good to get a commentary from the director but overall I give it 3.5 stars and Ill round that up to 4.",1160870400,6,1487,4.092783505154639
858288,5,6304375239,"I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!

Now, on to my review of the Judgment Night DVD.

VIDEO (A-): The films starts with a shot of the sky and then pans down to the neighborhood below. I have the newer Universal DVD (which I understood to be a very good transfer), so my heart sank when I saw quite a bit noise and speckles present in that first shot. Thankfully, however, this did not continue longer than 15 or 20 seconds. The rest of the film was clear and detailed. Black levels are very important since 95% of this movie takes place in very low light; again, the black levels held up nicely and so did the colors. It is presented in its proper theatrical aspect ratio and is anamorphically enhanced. While not a perfect transfer, it is certainly a very good one.

AUDIO (B): This DVD comes with DTS and DD 5.1 tracks; I always go for the 5.1 option and this one doesn't disappoint. The music enhances the scenes and action, but is almost always in the background and never clashes with the dialogue. That is to say, its mix is just as it should be. The effects are well-done, but there's nothing spectacular. There's nothing sonically wrong with film or the DVD, but this isn't one to show off your system with.

FILM (A-): The very definition of an underappreciated movie. Like many people, the only reason I became aware of its existence was because I caught it on the USA network one lazy afternoon (in fall 2005 to be exact). The ""look"" and ""feel"" of the film were such that I thought it was made more recently; I was quite surprised to learn that it was actually released in 1993. A dynamic cast, especially Leary, Gooding Jr., and Estevez, put in solid performances. The direction is competent and the cinematography is great. There isn't much in the way of a convincing story or plot, but it's an above-average thriller. It's linear, down-to-earth, not too grusome, and doesn't rely on gimmicks like sex scenes or nudity. Sadly, this movie is probably destined to languish in obscurity. I doubt many people would pick this up as an impulse buy, which is unfortunate, because I think most would be pleasantly surprised and actually enjoy it.",1149984000,6,2613,4.576923076923077
858289,4,6304375239,"From the cold, ruin-filled wastelands of Andrei Tarkovski's ""Stalker"", to the chiaroscuro-lit sewers in Carol Reed's filmnoir ""The third man"", to the chilly, rainy streets of post-World War Two Berlin in Wim Wenders' etherical fantasy ""Wings of desire""... backgrounds with piles of dust and bricks, abandoned houses and closed-down abattoirs have always been attractive to filmmakers, and for that matter, to filmviewers.
It's these scenes of destruction and suburban alienation as decor in which even so mentally degenerate characters plow their way through - it's the decor of a nightmare, a nightmarish existence, in which the viewer is trapped as well.

Going down the serial killer's basement in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", Jodie Foster went down some deep steps in her soul as well. The team of workers who are tearing down an abandonned insane asylum in the haunting ""Session 9"" are slowly tearing each other up as much. The two victims in ""Saw"" meet each other and possibly their doom in a big worn-down toilet. In ""The bone collector"" Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington crawl down empty sewers, steam pipes, old slaughterhouses and stuffy libraries to find the necessary clues to catch a bloodthirsty madman. Angelina does this crawling physically, Denzel only mentally, but both are bound the restrictions of their own personal confinements.
In ""Se7en"" not-so-clean-shaven Brad Pitt enters a house that is filled with cockroaches and the stench of death with a flinch of unease that warns him (and the viewer) of more gruwesome things to come.

In many ways it reflects the viewers own dark side, which he keeps very much hidden for the outside world, but which he does care to share in the cinema. As if we open up our own Pandora's Box as soon as the theatre lights go out and the desolate landscapes fill the screen. Watching movies is a form of escapism, but at the same time we tend to throw ourselves in the basements, stairways and pits, because deep down we know that at the end the theatre will be filled with light again, and we can assure ourselves that we're really not that much down the drain as we might thought two hours ago.

This whole thing gives these movies some kind of extentialism in their guts and reason for some meditation. That is, if you're looking for more than just entertainment of course - no filmmaker should force the viewer into spirituallity or cinematic Buddhism. It's up to the audience to do so or not.

And tonight we have the underrated action thriller ""Judgment night"" in which Emilio Esteves and his friends get lost in a remote part of town and find themselves prey of a nasty gang, lead by howling hound Denis Leary.
Project buildings, high walls, empty trains and burning car wrecks surround our buddies on every corner and they close in to almost claustrophobic proportions. This makes the scenery another part of the nasty gang, when it works against our small-time heroes' escape - but then, a few moments later, when the wind suddenly changes direction, it becomes a partner and gives our heroes shelter for a moment or two.

Because sometimes, just sometimes, our nightmares work against the monsters they seem so eager to produce.",1141430400,4,3195,4.887453874538745
858363,3,6304375239,"Plot: A group of four friends decide to take a shortcut through a ghetto on their way to a boxing game and end up witnessing the execution of a man by a ruthless gangster and his cronies after having wrecked their van. The rest of the film follows them as they are chased through the wasteland of a urban slum.

Pros: Denis Leary is the main thing that makes this movie worth watching. His character as a psychopathic gangster barking orders and spitting vulgarities contains a great amount of entertainment value. The action, although fairly unrealistic, keeps the movie running at a fast pace and never leaves the viewer bored.

Cons:The plot is fairly simple and the movie is skin deep as far as meaning is concerned, relying mostly on pure action, testosterone, and heroic feats. The characters are one-dimensional and with noncomplex personalities, so anyone who is expecting a movie with the sort of social commentary, outstanding performances, and incredible dialogue found in movies by directors such as Tarantino and Scorcese won't find anything but cheap thrills here. ""Judgment Night"" was too unrealistic and not ""gritty"" enough for my tastes. I found it ludicrous when the character played by Cuba Gooding Jr. decided to be some type of heroic cowboy and attempt to take out singlehandedly two hardcore and streetwise hoodlums who had lived their entire lives hustling on the streets and in prison. Furthermore, the final standoff between the gang leader and Emilio Estevez's character was a bit farfetched. I hardly think some upper middle class suburbanite without martial arts training would be able to beat a prison and street hardened hood in a fist fight. Actually, I found it hard to believe that a gangster would bother himself by chasing down a group of yuppies through a ghetto wasteland, risking his own life as well as those of his cronies, when he could just as easily gone to their houses after having found Estevez's characters driver's license in his wallet.

All in all, ""Judment Night"" is certainly worth watching, just don't take it too seriously.",1131753600,4,2078,4.9655172413793105

Nevertheless you get your money and time's worth with this gem, proving that you don't need huge stars to make a film exciting.
When this was filmed in 1993 Emilio Estevez was the biggest star of these four. Since then Stephen Dorff, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Denis Leary have all become famed feature film stars.  I saw this film about eight years ago. Believe me it is one of those films you can watch ten times in a row so buying the DVD is a must!  This is a thriller, comedy and action adventure all rolled into one. I was glad the filmmakers didn't throw in an unneeded romance or unneeded nudity. This is just a straight to the point picture about some homeboys crusing around at night, getting into trouble. And who hasn't been there right?  The acting is energetic and high-paced. No one in the film lets you down. Judgment Night is like a ride on a roller coaster while you're drunk...it's frightening, uninhabited and incredibly sponatenous all wrapped in one.  All I can say is if you like GOOD movies then you need to have this film in your collection. This is one buddy flick no one, male or female should miss.

858367,5,6304375239,"Since seeing this film I've never been comfortable with Denis Leary as a comedian because he's so damn convincing as the cold-hearted bad guy in this. I think he's a great actor but this is the movie to see him in as it's A. His best performance and B. One of the best villains ever in movies.

Leary plays Fallon, a dangerous criminal from Chicago's bad side. And when four middle class pals from the quiet suburbs cross him and witness a murder a chase across derelict landscapes follows. The spoon-fed quartet are way out of their comfort zone and have no idea how to navigate the ghetto or deal with its dwellers. Peter Greene, an actor always like to see, plays Sykes, one of Fallon's cohorts as well as Everlast from the rap group House of Pain as Rhodes. They sure do make a threatening impression.

Judgment Night kind of comes across as a modern, urban Deliverance. There are many similarities between them but Judgment Night clearly has more excitement. Estevez (who was cast very late after Tom Cruise and Christian Slater turned down the lead role), Gooding Jnr, Piven and Dorff play well off each other and Piven especially seems to really get into the whiny runt of his character. Though the editors really should have cut down the in-fighting and petty bickering between the quartet as it often slows the film down to a complete stop.

Director Stephen Hopkins (who also did Predator 2 and Blown Away) uses creeping camera movements and neo-noir lighting to provoke multiple eerie moments as well as a great deal of tension. Slow-mo and warped sound effects are also used to great effect in the finale. Alan Silvestri's score is also one of his best, alternating between several different moods. His first score (electronic based) was rejected by Hopkins but that difficult decision proved be a good judgment (ha!) as the end result is one of the film's best features.

Judgment Night is certainly an overlooked tour-de-force and is a brilliant action film with fine performances all round, but Leary completely and utterly steals the show.

The DVD by Universal brilliantly presents Judgment Night in it's proper aspect ratio of 2.35:1 with the gothic atmosphere and brooding silhouette photography in all its widescreen glory. The DTS sound design (Judgment Night was one of the first films recorded in this format) sounds brilliant too.

I'll watch anything at least once, and having seen Emilio Estevez in Loaded Weapon, thinking he had a little boy lost quality about him, I figured what the hell.
What was most disappointing about this movie was that the various chase scenes between the good guys and the bad guys never seemed to result in anything. The good guys (Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen Dorff & the other guy) were always far away from the bad guys (including the Christian Slater looking Denis Leary, and the guy from The Mask), or they come close, but more often than not, nothing happens. The only time they come close is when they're on the roof, and climbing across the ladder - the guy's name who I forget comes too damn close.
With all of the missing each other stuff, I was expecting a very anti-climatic ending. I was quite surprised at the face off between Emilio Estevez and Denis Leary. It certainly makes up for the rest of the film, and is edge-of-your-seat gripping stuff!
Otherwise, a fairly average movie.",1075161600,11,1166,4.610576923076923

Four suburnanite buddies travel into the city to attend a boxing match.  They make the trip in an expensive RV that one of the buddies, a car salesmen, has ""borrowed"" off the lot.  Fighting traffic they try and take a different route and end up lost in a very bad part of town.
Okay, stereotype alert.  This part of town seems totally abandoned.  Newspapers blow down the streets like tumbleweeds in an old western.  Unfortunately they are in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They witness a gangland slaying and the gang also sees them.
The four crash the RV and now have to flee on foot from the gang.  The gang leader is played well over the top by fast talking Dennis Leary.  Not the role I think he's best at but he does a decent job.
Emilio Estevez leads the ones who are on the run through this rugged part of town.  From there on it's a cat and mouse game as the friends are persued relentlessly.
As you can guess, the friends have to finally make a stand and fight back for their lives.
As said, the movie is pretty predictable but still fun.  Full of cliches but not bad.

This was no doubt a killer role for Emilio Estevez, in that it killed any chance of reviving his failing career. Cuba Gooding Jr. is lucky he was fresh enough a face for it to not stop his career dead in it's tracks.

However on their way they are delayed by a predictable Traffic jam on the highway and are already late to their fight, to avoid anymore delay, Ray decides to take a short cut despite the others opinions, and exit the highway. The 4 freinds are then lost in a very bad, poor and dark part of Chicago city where no sane man would dare go without a gun. Once ray takes his eyes of the road, He hits a man.

It then turns out that they other people are gang members led by the viciouse leader Fallon (played by Denis Leary) When Fallon finds out the criminal has taken his money he executes him, but then Fallon realizes the other 4 friends and he wants ... No Witnesses. The rest of the story is absolutley packed with thrilling and exciting action that is sure to get the old ticker racing.

This leads to one hell of a night for the four, as they accidentially witness a murder of a disloyal henchman by drug lord Fallon (Denis Leary), who has two rules: kill all liars, and leave no witnesses. He and his gang pursue the four through the underbelly of the city, while the four try to get help.
When originally released in October 1993, it bombed for reasons unknown. The performances by the central characters were awesome, with Denis Leary making a great villian. Goodtimes, however, aims to please as they present an excellent movie with a good transfer and widescreen to boot! The sound is great too. The DVD's praise, however, stops there. Aside from production notes, there are no extras on this DVD. I excuse this, however, as Goodtimes has never been known as a quality DVD distributor (No offense). Good try, Goodtimes.

858445,1,6304375239,"Can someone get an award for being the best thing in a bad movie? If so, Cuba Gooding, Jr. deserves it for
valiantly attempting to act well in the rehashed plot of what should've stayed a USA cable movie. Essentially, four middle class buddies, played by Ernilio Estevez as Frank Wyatt (titled as ""Everyman"" in the film's press packet); Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Mike Peterson, who plays Frank's righthand man/best friend; Stephen Dorff as John Wyatt, Frank's impulsive younger brother; and Jeremy Piven as Ray Cochran, Frank's sleazy, yuppie friend. There is a tendency in the film for the characters
to center around Frank, which could've worked if Frank had a character. This ensemble of stereotypes make a wrong turn on the expressway en route to a prize fight and end up as the prizes in a man vs. man hunt. Denis Leary, a raucous comedian seen on MTV and Nike commercials, plays Fallon, the psychopathic gang leader. The most difficult part of criticizing a bad movie is knowing that good actors have been saddled with a bad plot and bad characters. Estevez has been slaving away for a surefire hit since Stakeout to no avail. Gooding, Jr. was the recipient of the prestigious NAACP award for
his phenomenal debut performance as Tre Styles in Boyz N the Hood. I suppose even Gooding, Jr. can take a job like the rest of us to just pay the bills. We're all waiting with bated breath for his next film, a comedy, which co-stars tour d'force actors like Hulk Hogan. Cuba must have a lot of bills. Dorff starred in The Power of One, whose title also includes the number of days it was in theaters, the dimensions of his character in this film, and his acting ability. Finally, newcomer Jeremy Piven of The Larry Sanders Show should've backed out and given this re-hashed role to Paul Reiser, who originated a good yuppie
sleaze in Aliens 2.
Leary is simply his comedy persona with a gun. If director Steven Hopkins wanted to combine a comedian
with a gang leader, should've chosen Rita Rudner. Now that would've been original! The real problem with this film, which runs 109 minutes, is that it's 20 minutes too long. Good chase/hunt films like the Alien trilogy, Blade Runner, The Last of the Mohicans, and even Adventures in Babysitting are good because they stay in their mode as action thrillers.]udgment Night can't decide whether or not to be an action film, comedy, melodrama, or dramedy.]udgment Night also has another set of prob-
lems centering around its script: one, it was produced, and two, it is plagued with stereotypical characters,
action scenes, and death scenes.
A slight bright point to this farce is Peter Levy's work as the director of photography. There are great shots of faces in the foreground with another character in the background, which are as well done here as they are in Calvin Klein Obsession commercials. When you watch a film like this one, you shouldn't leave with a lesson in cinematography because the film is sad joke. I laughed through the whole thing because my ticket was free.
In conclusion, there are three points which beg attention. One, Estevez and Gooding, ]r. need to keep
looking for that ""right"" film for their genuine acting ability. Maybe Emilio's songstress (I use that term
lightly here} wife, Paula Abdul, can use them in her next video! It sure did give a boost to Keanu Reeves' career.
Two, director Steven Hopkins (previous films include the heavy Oscar contenders Predator 2 and Nightmare on Elm Street, Part 5} needs to stop feeding action movie pablum to us like we're newborns who haven't seen this done better, for less money, and with less insult. Which brings me to my last point: is this Hollywood's view of the inner city? Animals waiting to rend helpless wayward strangers? Neighbors who won't help those in desperate need?

858446,5,6304375239,"The main thing I loved about this movie was the environment. The chaotic ghost-town alleyways, the dark city streets, and the realism of how life truly is in the slums of America. I could almost smell the factories, the worn down apartment buildings, and the stormdrains. I think it also represents the human spirit, and how when all Hell breaks loose, you can't back down from a battle that could save your very life, and the lives of your dearest friends. Denis Leary is my favorite comedian (not to mention one of the best actors around), and Jeremy Piven plays a wonderful character actor. Leary plays the small-time gangleader with a hostile temper, yet a wickedly demented comedic side, while Piven plays the too-sure-of-himself businessman, who meets his tragic end due to Leary's temper. I first saw this movie when it was available to rent (never knew it existed until I saw it in Blockbuster), and it wasn't too long after I owned it on VHS, and just recently on DVD. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get bored with it. Now if I was some movie critic, I'd say thumbs up, but I'll just resort to rating it with 5 stars, and I recommend it to any great suspense movie fan.",1040169600,4,1200,4.534562211981567

Judgment Night is without a doubt one of the best and most underrated movies of all time and that my friends is absolutely NO joke. It's definitely on my top ten. The story is brilliant-four friends who  go out to see a boxing match but get stuck in a gang-infested street. They  notice a vicious drug gang murder someone and they are cought. The gang will  stop at nothing to terminate the guys. It's an excellent plot and a  refreshing take on the urban crime genre. The execution is totally  brilliant. Steve Hopkins direction is practically flawless. He gives the film  a truly gripping feel  and the suspense is extremely tight. Fallon will keep  on going and going and going until the four guys are gone for good. The  fight scenes are VERY intense and the whole way through I was biting my  nails and nearly p___ed my pants.

The movie defaults to the German track (obviously), but the English track is in uncompressed 5.1 DTS so it sounds great. Definitely glad I got this Blu-ray!",1506902400,3,557,4.58
