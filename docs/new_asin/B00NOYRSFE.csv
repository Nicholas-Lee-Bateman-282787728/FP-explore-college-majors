6674357,2,B00NOYRSFE,"See my review of the 'Nikon D-810 Beyond the Basics' DVD.  The best way to learn all of the functions of the camera and believe me, there are many, is simply to take the time to read the manual for a few days and you'll have the same, is not more information to apply towards the camera.",1429142400,,287,4.035087719298246

6674361,5,B00NOYRSFE,"This was a great buy for me. I have a terrible time understanding the ""regular"" manuals that come with your camera. This video is exactly what I needed.",1419897600,6,152,4.464285714285714
8679570,3,B00NOYRSFE,i already own a Nikon D800e. and they are pretty much the same with a few exceptions. I really didn't learn to much from the DVD.,1521158400,,129,4.0
8679571,5,B00NOYRSFE,Quite helpful.,1485648000,,14,6.5
8679572,3,B00NOYRSFE,"If you need ""a little more than the manual"" or you can't read the manual because you' re too tired, this is useful. The presentation is a bit robotic and impersonal but achieves its purpose. If you want a better explanation of the fundamental aspects, perhaps recommendations and better examples, look elsewhere.",1482278400,,312,5.019230769230769
8679573,2,B00NOYRSFE,"Step one: save your money.

This DVD is well produced; containing excellent images of the Nikon D810, its buttons, dials and menus. Unfortunately, its usefulness, to my mind, stopped short of providing much useful content. It is more a quick overview of the camera with very few tips or examples of the practical application of the myriad of controls and menu options.

Let's face it, anyone who owns a D810 can probably glean more useful information from a quick scan of the ""free"" User's Manual that came with the camera. Even someone who is more inclined to learn through audio-visual means probably will not get much from this DVD. For those that do not yet own a D810, this video is not the right one to help you evaluate the capabilities and features of one of Nikon's greatest cameras.

Step two: Pop over to YouTube and take a look at Tony Norton's free in-depth look at the D810. You will learn a lot more about the D810 and and get many more useful tips and ideas on how to configure your camera for different shooting needs... free of cost.

Step three: Take the money you save by not buying this DVD and come on back to Amazon to purchase Tony Norton's ""How to Create Stunning Digital Photography"" at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tony-Northrup-s-DSLR-Book-How-to-Create-Stunning-Digital-Photography/dp/0988263408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tony Northrup's DSLR Book: How to Create Stunning Digital Photography</a>",1459382400,5,1471,5.3826086956521735
8679574,5,B00NOYRSFE,Sure does help getting to know this great camera and using more of it's features.,1455580800,,81,4.466666666666667
8679575,4,B00NOYRSFE,This is good but does not work in my computer. I use my XBOX. There is an Android version. It would have been nice if we got the android app free for purchase of CD. That would have been far more helpful.,1447891200,,204,3.880952380952381

8679578,5,B00NOYRSFE,"I recently upgraded my digital SLR from a Nikon D200 to a Nikon D810.  Wow!, what an awesome camera!.  Although the owner's manual that came with the D810 was well written and detailed, I like to have a DVD to demonstrate the various features and functions...I seem to grasp and hold that information better with a visual.  I had previously used a Magic Lantern DVD for my D200 and it was a great help, but Magic Lantern didn't make a DVD for the D810 (as of the time I needed one).  I learned of the QuickPro guides and ordered a set from Amazon. The were shipped promptly and came in on time for a vacation I had planned.  The chapters were well organized and divided in an easy, logical order and all of the basic functions seem to be covered in good detail.  I went through the DVD twice before leaving on a10 day photo shoot in 3 southwestern national parks.  I retained almost all of the information I learned from the DVD and had to refresh my memory with the written manual only once.  I highly recommend this DVD guide if you prefer this type of information absorption.  I ordered the ""Nikon D810 Beyond the Basics"" DVD at the same time but haven't delved into that one yet.",1431648000,4,1183,4.365296803652968
