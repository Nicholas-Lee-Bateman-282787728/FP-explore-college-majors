7685339,1,B01CODVHR0,"About 20 or so years ago, I found a newly released VHS copy of Human Highway in Third Street Jazz in Philly (great place). My buddy and I couldn't wait to get back to his place to see it. We were on pins and needles. We loved everything Neil. (Trans excepted.) Popped it in and .... WOW! What a self-indulgent piece of hippie tripe. Suck could not even begin to describe it. Even the music sucked. This film has no point. Whatever point is trying to be made, wasn't. Nothing more than a rich, narcissistic rock icon pretending to be a filmaker. I am guessing more money and time was spent securing weed and cocaine, than actually making a coherent film. The best thing about this movie is that it employed some actors that probably could have used the dough at the time. Another reminder that the hippie dream was a lot of narcisistic hot air. All of you young fans of Neil who order this, don't say you were not warned. Put the money towards charity. Don't watch it illegally either, spend that time planting a tree or kicking a hippie.",1461196800,16,1037,4.40625

7685341,5,B01CODVHR0,"This is one of those films that few people would appreciate. Personally, I love the surreal world that it depicts. Years ago (1996) I bought the VHS version of it, and then later the Laserdisc edition. Now I've purchased the Blu-ray Director's Cut. The film looks great on Blu-ray. About the only complaint I have is with the cardboard sleeve case that the disc comes in instead of the standard plastic clamshell case. I imagine that was the producers making some sort of environmental statement (given the subtext of this particular film). I would have preferred to have the regular case. There isn't much in the way of extras with this disc - just the film, but there are some choices with audio - the sound is great. The film is full-frame - which is what was the standard for the time (1982). Very happy with my purchase.

7685342,1,B01CODVHR0,"After waiting through numerous delays for this to be released, I finally gave up and cancelled my order. Very unprofessional on Young's part. Now that I've read what a chop job it was, I won't be ordering it at all.",1473120000,2,215,4.4
7685343,1,B01CODVHR0,"A classic case of ""you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"" is HUMAN HIGHWAY. After creating a fascinatingly wrong-headed film to begin with (complete with a really offensive anti-Arab ""joke""), which  if nothing else  stood as a damaged time capsule from a cocaine-fueled era (which never had a proper release, to begin with, before being dumped to video with some clumsy changes), now Neil ""Bernard Shakey"" Young has succeeded only in applying ""clean-ness"" to a lump of coal.

It looks great (though the aspect ratio choice is very weird, as it is clearly framed for standard 1.85 widescreen, but is here mastered ""opened up""), and it sounds great, yet it manages to completely demolish the only truly successful sequence in the film, which is the Devo-Neil Young 10-minute demolition of ""Hey Hey, My My"", recorded and filmed live in the studio. It has, bizarrely, been chopped down to 3:00. This, from the pioneer of long and deep (and hard, and ugly) guitar jams with Crazy Horse. Baffling. Furthermore, as a 3-minute excerpt, which appears in the narrative of the ""dream sequence"" in a new place, no longer plays as the frenzied climax it worked as.

Why, Neil, couldn't you have at least included the original song sequence as an extra? If you are so embarrassed by it, why did you tell Crazy Horse that they needed to play it in concert more like Devo did? Truly one of the stranger choices this iconoclastic artist has made... effectively rendering the whole painful exercise that is the film a truly limp noodle with no payoff.",1472947200,3,1542,4.764044943820225

7685346,3,B01CODVHR0,"Comparing this new Blu-ray with the older VHS version: there are many changes Neil made in his Director's Cut.  Some changes are subtle, others are completely different.

The Blu-ray has a local radio broadcast not on the VHS version, which is played over several sections of the film and adds to the storyline.  ""Boogie Boy's Soliloquy"" is now at the end of the film as opposed to the beginning, which actually works better and allows impact to the message of the film.  The subtle changes, like adding dialog and extending a scene here and there tends to flesh out each character better and connects the story as a whole.

Lionel's dream sequence is where things really get turned around, and sadly for me; not for the better.  On the VHS, the dream sequence had a distorted quality to the picture that was omitted from the Director's Cut.  The Blu-ray also was completely re-edited from the VHS version with several shots re-cut.  Previously my favorite part of this film was the version of ""Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)"" with DEVO and Boogie Boy in the crib playing keyboards.  On the VHS version, this song runs 9:48, but on the new Blu-ray it only lasts 2:40.  I'm not sure what the motivation for such a dramatic edit, but needless to say, I'm disappointed.  Perhaps he thought it slowed down the flow of the story. But for me the longer more bizarre song section helped to illustrate the madness of rock stardom beautifully to conclude with Lionel's dream/nightmare/fantasy.

The new version has a much improved picture and sound from the VHS.  Had Neil left ""Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)"" at 9:48, I would have easily given this release 4 stars, but let's be honest here, this isn't great cinema in the classic sense, yet it does have a great deal of charm.  Neil's character Lionel really steals the show for me, and his portrayal of Lionel is spot on.  DEVO are also a big draw as they bring their own strange vibe to the proceedings.

Am I glad to own this new Director's Cut of Human Highway?  Yes.  Do I wish it was the same as the VHS?  Not exactly.  Most of the changes improve the storytelling, but missing 7 minutes with DEVO is a real bummer.  I wish Neil would have included the complete song as a special feature, but alas...there are no special features on the disc.",1469491200,30,2292,4.541463414634146

Much like Rust Never Sleeps Shakey Pictures did a great job restoring Human Highway from its original film negatives and analog soundtrack tapes. When I was 12 years old in 94 I remember watching this film with my father on VHS, the good news is that is version is much better than the version released on VHS in 94 or 95. Great comedy regarding people living in a fog while Mother Earth gets destroyed, sound familiar?",1469404800,2,523,4.34020618556701
7685348,4,B01CODVHR0,"The Neil Young/DEVO version of ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"" is worth more than the price of the movie. Buy it and love it. I also think Neil is funny as heck as the gas station mechanic. Top notch Canadian humor if you get it. If not,  just listen to the music.",1466985600,4,267,3.8545454545454545
7685349,5,B01CODVHR0,"This movie is a lot of fun, its cast featuring members of David Lynch's stock company, including Russ Tamblyn, Dean Stockwell, Dennis Hopper and an absolutely ravishing Charlotte Stewart. Plus you get cult actress Sally Kirkland, Fox Harris (J. Frank Parnell in 'Repo Man'), the late New York folk-rocker David Blue, and those beloved spuds from Akron, Devo. It's really a shame that Neil Young did not pursue a parallel career making smart, whimsical films like this one. But really, why no domestic Blu-Ray release?",1461715200,16,517,5.094117647058823

Tho the directors cut left me disappointed- yes better quality image and sound,however  the cadence and mystery of the original was replaced by an overcast of radio disc jocks doing an annoying play by play not to unlike Phil Rizzuto's monologue on Dashboard Lights.

8753573,1,B01CODVHR0,"After watching this film in its entirety from start to finish, I can honestly say I think I found a legal substitute for water boarding. I'd rather scoop an eyeball out with a dull spoon than watch this again. When the best part of a film is a Devo performance, you know it's bad. The Devo guy with the baby mask is especially creepy, and he seems to be the smartest of the entire cast. There aren't even any live Neil Young performances to rescue this film, yet he is shown performing live in a few scenes such as the ""Dream Sequence"" and during talent night. This film makes Magical Mystery Tour look like Citizen Cane. If you must watch it then watch it at midnight with some friends with a buzz on. One of the biggest problems with this film is the characters aren't developed so you really don't care what happens them. The film is just all over the place. If it has a message I'll be darned if I know what it is. And though this is the ""Director's Cut"", there are no behind the scenes segments, out takes, interviews, etc., which are typically associated with Director's Cuts. The special effects are cheesy but I didn't mind that. It shows Neil is creative beyond just music and has a sense of humor, not that this film is hilarious, but he should stay out of the film business. If he is so pro-environment he would have done more for the cause by donating the millions it cost to make this film. Also, no nudity. After sitting through this mess, at least treat us to some T & A.",1494720000,3,1486,4.310714285714286
8753574,1,B01CODVHR0,"If that wasn't the dumbest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is. I was excited to find this. I had heard about it some years back, and had wanted to see it ever since. I'm a fan of both Neil Young and Devo. So I thought a socio-political satire movie with both of these artists collaborating to make it? I'M IN!!!! I should have stayed out. I was expecting surreal, with some poignant satire. All I got was just plain silly, with an all too long segment that made zero sense as to how it fit with the rest of the ""movie"", that just seemed to showcase both Devo and Young, and wound up in a trippy, pointless dream sequence. I got the point, but it would have been better if they had kept it to a 15 minute short film. As a feature length movie, it loses any bite, and just slips into silliness.
