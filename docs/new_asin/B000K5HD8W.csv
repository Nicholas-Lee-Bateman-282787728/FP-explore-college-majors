I didn't think that Michael looked comfortable in the role but it may have been because I had only seen him in the TV series before. I think he needs more of an action movie to display his great acting talent.",1259280000,,480,6.073529411764706
8154404,5,B000K5HD8W,"I have to say I think I enjoyed this film, because I am one of four very close friends.  Two of my friends I could totally put in with these four, but I am fairly sure I am Thadd.

Any how, this film shows how four friends make a bet to see who can go to a new city with a mere hundred dollars and come back with the greatest ""Net Worth"".

We have the womanizer, drinker, who uses his God given talent to talk himself into any woman's bed.

Then there is the workaholic, who has forgotten why he works so hard.

The happily married man, who would kill to have a child, and his wife keeps vetoing him.  (She seems to think more money in the bank will make for a better family.)

And finally the group screw up.  He doesn't have a dime to his name but has a heart of gold and would do anything for anyone but himself.

I really enjoyed this film, and am very happy I own a copy, because I can see me watching this again and again.",1232236800,,928,3.946236559139785
