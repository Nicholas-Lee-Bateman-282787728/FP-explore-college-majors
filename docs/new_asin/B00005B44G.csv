1420853,5,B00005B44G,"Add one 1/4 cup of Gold Fish scooping, 1/8 a cup of Michiru's and Haruka's Charm and Grace, 1/8 a cup of Euguel's Mischief, 2/4 Usagi's Clumsiness and table spoon of Pink Sugar and Mix well...  And what do you Get?  Sailor Moon S - Heart Collection III
And while your Mixing why don't you have a cup of green tea or a glass of Wine *oops I mean Juice* to help wash done the tears of laugher you will be having while your watching this DVD...
Since Chibiusa's appearance at the Komono festival, the girls are not only busy studing for exams, and kicking some Evil Butts but also stuck with Baby Sitting the Most Junior Member of the Sailor Scouts...  And Sailor Mini-Moon is ready and willing to fight for Love and Justice, if only her attack would work straight away..
But that's not the end of the Fun with The Girls Being Invited to a Ball, the Down side is that they would have to speak English which Usagi finds really troubling.
We Find out how Michiru and Hakura meet, and how Hakura became Sailor Uranus.
Chibiusa takes art classes to be near a boy she likes, trouble is He likes Michiru and Chibiusa isn't giving him out without a fight.
Mako-Chan goes away to train to gain more power so that she can kick the Bad Guys Bums Harder, But the rest of the Sailor Scouts aren't far away to give Mako-Chan Support (and so Usagi can take advantage of the location to visit Mamoru at work, But her Plans are foiled by Luna and Euguel isn't far away).
Chibiusa wishes to be friends with a Master of Tea Ceremonies and become his Apprentice, But Euguel has other Plans in Mind.
And Let me Not Forget the Fun of the Komono Festival with the girls looking after the Gold Fish Scooping Booth while Rei tries to help a Drummer with her stage fright, But the Bad Guys always have to gate crash a good time don't they.
I really Loved this DVD..  I paid $50 Australian Dollars for this DVD and it was worth every cent..  But for older viewers watch the Subbed version, with the Toonami version it has been altered drastically for the younger viewers so it doesn't have anything which would offend...  Although there is nothing offence on the Subbed Version which will ruin their young minds..",1005264000,,2184,4.393564356435643
1420854,5,B00005B44G,I've purchased this DVD. I watched it the time first subtitled and uncut. The changes aren't devastating. In fact they're tolerable. The english episodes aren't exactly uncut. Because I watched the dubbed version with subtitles and the dialogue is only changed concerning Haruka and Michiru. Other than that you kill to birds with one stone. You have the Dub for the kiddies and the subtitles for a mature individual. No need to buy the VHS tapes. You have the Toonami version and Japanese version rolled into a Hybrid DVD.,1000598400,,523,4.887640449438202
1420855,5,B00005B44G,"Sorry, I just love episode 106. I'm still not sure how exactly they thought the whole cousins thing would go over with *that* ep! LOL. Spider stretches. Riiiiiight. Lots of runners stretch their fingers. o. O
Anyway, Sailormoon S is one of the best series, right after Stars. S just has waaaaay too much boring Mimete-induced filler after ep 110.
Oh, and can anyone else believe that they actually included the reverse cover like that? ""Mommy, why does it look like Amara and Michelle are gonna kiss?""

1420856,5,B00005B44G,"This disc is mostly more of the same, but with one main addition - Sailor Chibi-Moon ^^ Chibi-Usa, the pink-haired girl from the future who everyone either loves to hate or just plain loves, has come back from the future to train as a Sailor Soldier and to make new friends. This disc manages to be the funniest one so far (Chibi-Moon's attack doing absolutely nothing is classic, as is the girls trying to speak English), but also contain the most serious episode so far (the fourth episode on the disc, which gives an insight into how Haruka and Michiru met and how they became Sailor Soldiers).
So, to put it simply, this disc is more of the same, but better.
Technically speaking this disc is of the same quality as the first two, except that the cropping is finally gone for good. The menus this time feature Sailor Chibi-Moon's transformation animation (and they're much nicer than the Jupiter menus from disc 2). The extras are a biography/mini-gallery of Chibi-Usa, plus the original opening for the first two episodes (complete with kanji credits, which happen to be the reason it was never used to begin with).
On the dub side of things, two of the episodes on this disc are heavily rewritten. One of them was the first one, most of which was just totally rewritten for no apparent reason (very reminiscent of DiC -_-). The other is the episode about Haruka and Michiru's past that I mentioned above. The thing is, what annoys me most about the dub of that episode wasn't the completely butchered script, but the fact that it was narrated by Amara, who has to have the most boring voice in the world -_- Also, in one of the episodes they turned a male character into a female character, despite the fact that Chibi-Usa had a crush on him - except apart from that the episode was faithfully translated, crush and all. Makes you wonder why they feel the word ""cousins"" is so necessary when referring to Amara and Michelle *sighs*
And finally, the packaging. The outside cover is pink. Not just a little bit pink, VERY pink. Too pink for me. On the other hand, the inside cover features a beautiful picture of Uranus and Neptune not looking much like cousins. I'm sure you can guess which one I chose.
So, to sum up, it all comes down to this - if you liked the first two, buy this. And if for some reason you liked disc 1 but not disc 2, you can rest assured that the series is going uphill from here. Enjoy ^^",994377600,4,2418,4.4852607709750565

1420858,5,B00005B44G,"This DVD will be a real treat for any fan of Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon. The third commercial installment of the Sailormoon S Series; this volume continues where the second collection left off..
Chibi Usa returns! And this time she is Sailor Chibimoon! The little pink-haired cutei comes back from the future to modern day Tokyo, but first she must help Sailormoon and Sailormars out of a little trouble... She stays with Usagi on orders from her mother to train to be a good soldier and to make important friendships... Yet making friends isn't as easy as it seems for poor little Chibi Usa (and it usually leads her and Usagi into a bit of a mess)... The Death Busters and the new Witches 5 member, Eudial, are on the move capturing more pure hearts, hoping to find the three talismans which will bring forth the legendary holy grail... And their daimons are weirder than ever... Makoto wished to be a stronger senshi, forgetting that their are more important things than power.. Sailoruranus reveals some secrets of the past, how she met Michiru, and her awakening as a Sailor senshi.. Oh dear! The Sailor senshi must learn to speak english?! At an American party Usagi gets a bit tipsy... How will she ever fight like that???
You cannot miss your chance to see some of the most hilarious Sailormoon episodes ever! I have old fansub copies and I can quarantee that many of these episodes will make you laugh till you hurt!

7936660,5,B00005B44G,I've always loved sailor moon! With the new remake of it coming out this year I wanted to buy all the old seasons. Please note that this is not the entire season but a selection of the season. I recommend buying the box set if you have the money but this isn't a bad option if you can't afford the box set of season 3.,1358294400,,318,3.9076923076923076

7936662,5,B00005B44G,"ok really wasn't going to write a review for this since it's unnecessary, but this disc did contain one of the most critical haruka and michiru (uranus and neptune) episodes.  unlike most fans of sailor moon, i was not caught in the whole craze when it was first brought over to the US and thus did not see the dubbed version of BSSM.  Perhaps this was luck but reading about the controversy of the dubbed SM years later i can say that it is very disappointing to see the way dubbing companies handled the relationship between Haruka and Michiru who, in my most humble opinion, happen to be one of the sweetest and graceful couples to ever grace the tv screen.  They were cousins?!  I mean best friends would have been understandable but cousins?!  However, Pioneer did do something good in releasing the original uncut version of Sailor Moon, which is far superior to the dubbed.",1050624000,,880,4.615384615384615
7936663,5,B00005B44G,"hello everyone out there! this is a great DVD!! i hate the english dub, but the original japanese version is great! this is a couple of really funny episodes. it also shows the return of my favorite character (i also love Galaxia and Seiya.)Chibi-usa. (or Rini for you dub lovers -.-) the yoma's and some of the people are weird, but it just makes it funnier! ^_^",1049500800,,363,4.432835820895522

7936665,5,B00005B44G,"This is volume 3 of 6
This is my favorite volume of all, because two of my favorite SMS episodes are in it. The first is the return of Chibi-usa (Rini in the dubbed version) which is full of a lot of funny moments. The second ep on the disc contains a scene that was changed for the dub for obvious reasons. Watch it subtitled and you'll see why. It's wierd, but funny. The last episode on the disc is very funny. I won't say too much, but you get to hear Usagi and the girls speak in English. (Japanese girls speaking English is very funny, especially the way they say it.) If you like Uranus and Neptune or chibi-Moon, be sure to get this DVD.  If not, get it anyway. It's definitely worth it.",1035072000,2,695,4.148148148148148
7936666,5,B00005B44G,"Hey, it's me again reviewing your Heart Collection DVDs!
As it is apparent in the cover of this third exciting disc, I think it's safe to say it's NOT a spoiler that the kawaii (cute) little brat named Rini is returning to the series, and is making her cameo in this plot as Sailor Chibi Moon (Mini Moon for you dub lovers).
The series takes a chill pill from the dramatic threats of society to focus a little on Rini's return. Have fun! I'm sure this disc was meant to do so.
Although nothing big happens now, you'll take a little trip down memory lane and visit a chunk of Haruka/Amara's past, so there are only a couple dramatic moments in the disc.
This disc is great! It's smooth all around. It isn't bombarded with many climatic parts (not that it's a good or bad thing), and pertains to Chibi Moon, as it should be in the menus and extras. Pioneer repents and let's you view the original opening in the extras.
Even though it's VERY pink...I give it five stars! I love it. Got it back in April - still love it! I know you will too! Don't wait. You need excessive episodes of Sailor Moon to survive!",1022284800,,1105,4.291866028708134
7936667,5,B00005B44G,"----------------------------------------------------------------
This is the thrid dvd of the Heat Collection Series. It has 6 episodes.
This DVD offers a little change of pace: The return of the ""BRAT"", Reeni. (Sailor Mini-Moon)  Adding a somewhat comical aspect to the adventures of more heart-snatcher fighting episodes, it does liven things up a little.
Another big addition to this DVD are the rather cool transformation scenes of Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, and the story on how they met, and how they became to be the Sailor Scouts.
Eugeal is now in charge, the team leader of the Witches 5, Bureau of Bad Behavior, who does the actual heart-snatching with her gun and rather using the diamond pods (the monsters that are created from the different objects) as her body guards.  Like the usual, her plans get foiled episode after episode.
This DVD gets a 5-star rating: The continually insignificant roles of the other four Sailor Scouts are made up by the added transformation scenes and background stories from the new Sailor Soldiers, and the return of the pink haired Reeni.",1017446400,3,1091,5.123595505617978
7936668,5,B00005B44G,"So far out of the whole S series, I would have to say that this one was the funniest, especially the second episode when Rini is trying to make friends.  But if you like the focus of the show on Sailor Moon( like I do) don't expect it in this one, it focuses on Rini.  Not that I have a thing against her, but in the anime version I can't help feel bad for Serena, cause she can't help the fact that she's clutzy and Rini is just so plain mean to her, unlike in the manga they start off with a little fighting but are more loveing towards each other.  But I guess it's for comic relief, but over all I really liked this one, and is worth the while, a must if you want to get to know Rini a little better, because after all she is cute(but should be a little nicer to her future mother)Hope this helps.  Just to let you know the second episode was so funny I was actually crying from laughing so hard, but if you watch it, make sure you watch in subtitles first, beacuse the original Japanese version is so much funnier( in the English version, they try to cover up this one seen, that there was no point in trying to cover up, because of the fact that it was so obvious what was really going on--if you've seen it I'm sure you know what I mean!!!)Definately worth the space on your DVD rack.!!!!",1005436800,,1295,4.086614173228346
