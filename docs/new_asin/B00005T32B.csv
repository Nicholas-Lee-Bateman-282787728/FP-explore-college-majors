Unlike some films which choose to focus on the poverty in those rural areas of China, this one presented a place of incredible natural beauty and timeless traditions. The tranquility of the scenery and closeness of the families make me nostalgic of my childhood, growing up in a small town in Shanxi. The direction and photography were magical. Don't know how they managed to get the residents behave so naturally in front of cameras. But even during this short period of time covered by the documentary, you can tell that times are changing. I finally got to visit Lijiang last year. I was probably fifteens years too late to re-live this film. Now the old town is occupied by small hostels, bars, and herds of tourists. Still, the clear blue sky, majestic snow mountains made it a worthwhile trip. The last two decades have brought drastic changes to China. I only wish that, through the prosperity brought on by tourism, people will realize what a great gift they have been given, and it can be preserved for generations to come.",1276732800,4,1160,4.6911764705882355
