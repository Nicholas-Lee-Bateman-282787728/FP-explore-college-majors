8746889,4,B01AB4ADIS,"A favored plot device in Taiwanese dramas is the theme of delayed recognition. A character appears early on and for reasons usually related to youth and immaturity that character fails to impact on others. In WHEN I SEE YOU AGAIN, directors Chen Jia Hong and Zhang Jin Rong begin with the male lead a rather nerdy Xia You Qian (Jasper Liu) who falls in love with the beautiful An Xi (Mandy Wei). She likes him but does not let him know this so in an attempt to win her favor goes to significant trouble to gather what she has told him she wants above all else, a rare liquid called ""Angel's Tear."" This he does but when he appears at her doorstep carrying a vial of the Tears, An Xi inexplicably berates him as she throws the bottle on the ground shattering it into shards. Xia You Qian is devastated and thinks she is a heartless harridan and leaves their village, vowing never to return.

  Fast forward ten years. Xia You Qian is now a successful and hunky business magnate charged with purchasing land in the very village in which he suffered his broken heart at the hands of An Xi. The theme of delayed recognition begins when he sees her and immediately recognizes her but she fails to recognize him. Most of the first ten episodes of the twenty in the series focus on his thinking only of her as a mean spirited girl who delights in crushing geeky types. He plots petty revenges but as he gets to now her better, he sees her as a kindly soul and when he discovers that she smashed the vial ten years earlier only out of frustration of learning that her mother had inexplicably abandoned her, he tells her of his true feelings.  An Xi, of course, rejects him when she learns of his true identity. The film's second half changes course from romantic drama to corporate melodrama. As is typical in Taiwanese dramas, true evil is not allowed to exist. There are only cartoonish stick figures of evil. One such uni-dimensional pseudo-evil is so laughably over the top, Jiang Hai Kuo (Kao Meng-Chieh) that he is seen as a Taiwanese Snidely Whiplash from the Dudley Dooright cartoons.  A second example of an evil-doer who is not so evil at all is a business competitor of Xia You Qian, Hu Yan Ze (Jet Chao) who comes across as a kinder version of J. R. Ewing from the American television show DALLAS. Hu Yan Ze plots and schemes his way up the corporate ladder but underneath his scheming is a little boy who wants only the recogition long denied him. It is this undercoating of motivation that renders WHEN I SEE YOU AGAIN as a gripping drama even as it meanders in and out of melodrama. A potential sore point for Western viewers is the Taiwanese directorial tradition of presenting human drama in a way baffling to non-Asians.  Characters grin and otherwise act goofy in moments immediately following scenes of high tension. Such scenes are the Taiwanese equivalent of Shakespeare inserting outrageous puns and low comedy to dispel the tragic overtones of any unbearable scene. Still, WHEN I SEE YOU AGAIN is a worthwhile examination of what a long ago hidden character may someday magically and believably morph into.",1459900800,2,3122,4.596050269299821
