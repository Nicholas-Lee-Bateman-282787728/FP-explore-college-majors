1465237,5,B00005JLSE,"I'll make this brief:  Yeah, it deserved all the academy awards it won.  Catherine Zeta Jones is more brilliant as an actress and dancer than she is sexy in this film.  The direction is immaculate.  Richard Gere is compassionate and great in a perfect against type role for him. Rene Zellweger is magnificent.  And Queen Latifa unexpectedly steals almost every scene she's in.
Oh yeah, and the music, dancers and choreography...are out of this world.

1465238,5,B00005JLSE,"The title of this review is no exaggeration this movie was truly amazing. While it highlighted the musical and dancing talents of its stars not just one person in this movie shined they all did. This movie based on the Broadway musical is better than the musical ever was. This movie was able to take the vision that the writer had and bring it to life in a way that the musical never could. It was able to clearly separate reality from fantasy with dazzling dance numbers, fantastic music terrifically performed by the stars. This movie is one of the best movies we have seen in years and it is not even in the same league of alot of the dribble that Hollywood has been subjucting to us. Even if you hate musicals go to this movie just to see the cell block tango, it was amazing. If this movie does not sweep the Oscars then the Oscars have some serious explaining to do. And Richard Gere Should have been nominated for an Oscar as well he was excellent.",1048377600,,956,4.346368715083799

As someone who doesn't usually like musicals, I went to this movie with the expectation that I wouldn't be that impressed. Boy, was I wrong. The actors are great. Each and every one of them did tremendous jobs with the singing, dancing, and acting. I was especially impressed with Richard Gere's performance as opportunistic lawyer Billy Flynn. I also am not usually a fan of Richard Gere, but he is an incredible singer and actor. . . . there was also a terrific tap dance number that made me fall in love with him! I was also surprised at the talent that was demonstrated by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, and Queen Latifah. The direction in this movie was also the best I have ever seen, especially for a musical. . . this director definately deserves an Oscar for this one! As an obsessed fan, I also own the soundtrack and would definately call it the best soundtrack I have ever heard! So if you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. The acting, dancing, singing, the costumes. . . there isn't one bad part in the entire movie!",1048377600,,1167,4.432558139534883

1465373,5,B00005JLSE,"Review for Chicago
Hot Toasty Rag, January 13, 2018

Its difficult for me to describe all the ways in which I love Chicago, because often times when attempting the explanation, my description winds up just as long as the features length. The short version of my recommendation would be for you to buy a copy for yourself as soon as possible. I had a VHS version that I watched so many times the colors started to fade, and now Im happily watching my DVD copy ad nauseum.

Ive seen the musical Chicago live onstage, and its terrible. No one who actually likes music would enjoy sitting through the show. The script is crass, the characters aren't developed, and the songs are annoying. But, magically enough, when Bill Condon wrote the script for the film adaptation, everything changed. He and director Rob Marshallin my humble opinion, one of the greatest directors of the modern eracompletely changed the point of the story and made it not only accessible, but fascinating to film audiences. While onstage, its about an aspiring showgirl who goes to jail for murdering her lover, in the film, its about a fragile, disappointed woman who uses the allure of the stage as a mental escape when shes frightened. See how much more interesting that story is?

Ive watched every behind-the-scenes featurette included on my DVD, and have since learned that Condon and Marshall purposely redesigned the story that way. Every time theres a musical number, its because Rene Zellwegers character needs a mental distraction from her surroundings. When shes being questioned by the police, she imagines the song Funny Honey, her first night in prison is comforted by the Cell Block Tango, etc. Every song is in Renes imagination. Not only is that method of storytelling incredibly clever and shows a unique side to the main character, but its a great way to get audiences hooked into a film musical, a genre that pretty much died out in the 1970s, with the exception of 2001s Moulin Rouge. Chicago is infinitely superior to Baz Lurhmanns spectacular because it doesnt bombard the senses. Its a thoughtful, sensitive piece, perfectly balancing the fine line between musical comedy and a dramatic murder story.

In the golden age of musicals, songs and dances were often filmed in whole takes so audiences could see the continuity and realism of the actors talents. Because of the way the story was designed, the numbers in Chicago couldn't be captured in long takes. The scenes constantly cut back and forth between fantasy and reality, simultaneously entertaining the audience with a song and advancing the story. Martin Walsh, the editor of Chicago, had his hands full with the multitude of camera angles and the challenge to set and maintain two separate paces within each song. The end result is a beautiful work of art.

Now, onto the performances. Rene Zellweger didn't take home the gold that year, even though her turn as Roxie Hart was the best performance of her career. She won her make-up Oscar the following year for her supporting role in Cold Mountain, a role that, given her Southern roots, she could have done in her sleep. Rene captures every subtle emotion of her character, making her situation sympathetic to the audience, even though shes shown cheating on her kind-hearted husband, murdering her boyfriend, and tricking her husband into taking the blame. How is someone like that sympathetic? Because the audience feel so incredibly sorry for her, this fragile woman with dreams of grandeur and severe mental issues. Rene is absolutely perfect.

Richard Gere takes the male lead, Billy Flynn, a part highly coveted in the musical theater world. Just like his costar, he takes a character thats utterly unlikable on paper and transforms him into someone the audience completely falls in love withand not just because hes Richard Gere. His comic timing and charm play off Renes insecurities wonderfully, and he seems to glide through the part effortlessly, as if hes done it a hundred times before and will probably do it again tomorrow. He doesnt seem bored or tired, though, just very well preparedas Billy Flynn is supposed to be! Billy is the best lawyer in Chicago, so he actually has gone through his song and dance a hundred times before. Its a fine line to walk, and Richard walks it.

In the supporting cast are Catherine Zeta-Jones, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah. Each have their own show-stopping numbers that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Each character, even the smaller parts, are given many character facets to jugglemirroring the reality-fantasy combination of the songsand its a true testament to Rob Marshalls directing that every actor and actress nail their parts. Queen Latifah is hardened and only slightly compassionate, but you cant help but trust her even when you know you shouldnt. John C. Reilly is every smart girls idea of an ideal husband, and his Mr. Cellophane will probably make you cry. Every time I watch it, I wish I could reach into the television and give him a gigantic hug.

Catherine Zeta-Jones dazzles from start to finish, and while everyone has their own favorite and most beautiful performance, her turn as Velma Kelly might be mine. Shes the archetypical 1920s vamp and uses every ounce of star power to attract and propel Renes character through the story. As realistic and raw as Renes performance is, Catherines is equally staged and calculated. She makes bad look so good, its no wonder Rene aspires to be just like her!

Chicago swept the 2003 Academy Awards, winning Best Editing, Costumes, Sound, Supporting Actress, Art Direction, and Picture, with Kirk and Michael Douglas famously reading the winner aloud onstage together. Additional nominations were earned for Cinematography, Directing, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Actress, and Original Song for I Move On, played during the end credits. Obviously, if I had my way, Rob Marshall, John C. Reilly, and Bill Condon would have taken home statuettes as well. Julianne Moore also gave the best performance of her career that year in Far From Heaven, so I would have tied the leading ladies and given them both Oscars; Edward Lachmans cinematography in Far From Heaven was also beautiful, so I probably would have tied that category as well.

Whatever reason you decide to watch Chicago, whether its for the eye-catching costumes, hidden talents of stars you didn't know were musical, clever storytelling, or beautifully framed and edited scenes, Im sure youll be entertained. I come from a long line of theater performers, and while my mom didn't like this movie, she admitted she was able to appreciate the work that went into it and how expertly Rene was able to sell her songs. Ive written three musicals myselfand Im the first to admit that Kander and Ebbs songs are the weakest elements of the showand I still absolutely love this movie.

DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not your friend. The last scene has a bit of swirling camerawork and some flashing lights, and it might make you sick. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1515801600,,7149,4.939267886855241

1465867,5,B00005JLSE,I LOVE this version of Chicago-went out and bought the DVD copy for myself and a friend that lives in Chicago. He actually seen this on the NY stage- I was so impressed by this movie. Catherine is officially my favorite actress! All the cast is wonderful in their roles. I did not realize they could sing!

1465870,1,B00005JLSE,"The main problem with this Hollywood musical is the casting. Despite the Oscar, Catherine Zeta-Jones does not cut it as a Broadway musical star, especially when the talent of Bebe Neuwirth is out there. Watch a grainy YouTube recording of Ms Neuwirth's performance of All that Jazz and be amazed.  Her lithe body moments and a soft sultry voice entice you to feel the jazz of the period. Then watch Ms Zeta-Jones trailer performance. It is all about the face (mainly the eyes). Her body language and voice does not sizzle, but cries ""Look at me, I am sexy.""  Don't think so.

Without Broadway song and dance, it is not a good musical. I salute the producers/directors who include real Broadway cast members in major roles.  Thus we can experience the talent of Tommy Tune in Hello Dolly.  Better yet, Eddie Foy, Jr., Reta Shaw, and Carol Haney in Pajama Game. Broadway history caught on film, there.  What was this? Mere Hollywood..",1489708800,,932,4.722222222222222

1465936,5,B00005JLSE,"A throughly enjoyable and entertaining film version of the Broadway production.
Two of my favorite scenes are  ""When you're good to mama"" played by Queen Latifah and the mesmerizing ""Cellblock Tango"".

My only complaint is the pacing, which could have been a tad less ""galloping"" for lack of a better word; which almost leaves you gasping for air.
Otherwise, the production values, choreography and stagings are superb.

I saw the 1996 revival which was fun and memorable, but I especially appreciated the often overlooked portrayal of ""Mr. Cellophane"" who I believe may have been played by Amos Hart; unfortunately I don't have the original Playbill to verify this.",1489190400,5,666,5.148148148148148

This is a movie to watch over and over just for fun.  I find myself singing the songs from it as I do my housework each day.  The music sticks with you.

1466452,3,B00005JLSE,"This is really a gross average of 0s and 5s. The cast's performances were all 5's. The cinematography was a weird mixture of terrible and brilliant. I understand that putting a stage production on film is challenging. The stage performances lost a lot of continuity because of too-numerous cuts. A handful of the cuts were riveting. They would have been even more striking if you didn't have visual whiplash from all the others. Also, dance requires some duration to appreciate the sequence of movement; there was far to little of this. On the other hand, the cuts between ""stage"" and ""reality"" were perfect. The biggest drawback, however, was the story. I didn't like anybody. At the end, when Velma and Roxie tell their adoring movie audience ""We couldn't have done this without you"" I wondered if the message of ""Chicago"" was supposed to be a criticism of the real audience for watching and elevating nihilistic movies like ""Chicago."" I don't think Watkins (the 1926 playwright) intended this, and, if anyone can convince me that Bob Fosse wanted to convey that message,  I will gladly give ""Chicago"" 10 out of 5 stars and rank it among the best films/plays ever made. Otherwise, I would sum it up as ""great talent going nowhere in pursuit of nothing.""",1473465600,3,1255,4.837209302325581

1467716,5,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is a musical film adapted from the satirical stage musical of the same name, exploring the themes of celebrity, scandal, and corruption in Jazz Age Chicago. It stars stars Rene Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. It centers on Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, two murderesses who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s Chicago. Velma, a vaudevillian, and Roxie, a housewife, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows. It is directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall, and adapted by screenwriter Bill Condon.

Roxie Hart is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos. Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley, a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly, a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron ""Mama"" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxie's story all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines.

A rousing and energetic adaptation of the Broadway musical, Chicago succeeds on the level pure spectacle, but provides a surprising level of depth and humor as well. This film adaptation, written by Bill Condon, is somewhat kinder and gentler than the stage versions that preceded it. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones put on quite a show in Rob Marshall's dazzling cinematic rethinking of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical directed by Bob Fosse. Singing live in the rehearsal hall while going through the strenuous motions of Marshall's choreography, Zeta- Jones is every inch the consummate performer and undeniable star and Zellwegger defines delicious. It is a must-see musical.",1448064000,,2350,5.054123711340206

1468018,5,B00005JLSE,"Absolutely fabulous movie! We saw Chicago on stage, and the music was stuck in my head so long, that I simply had to buy the movie to hear it all again! The story is great, too, speaking of the corruption and ways of the media, not only in the past, but in the present as well. The stage is well-set, and this is one of the best movies ever. With catchy music, a drawing story, and moments of hilarity and sadness, the movie is certainly a hit. Not for younger audiences, as it does have murder, sexual themes, etc.. This movie is not similar to many other stage-to-film movies, as it is not simply a ""view from the audience,"" nor is it a film following one person around and expanding beyond the text of the original. It has jumps from on-stage to in the jail, but is done really well. It's like a combination of watching from the audience and seeing a movie, or cut scenes from the past, at the same time. We watched this on stage as a family, then bought the film, and a few weeks later, we watched it. Most agreed the experiences were different, both good, but the film does a great job of recreating the play in a unique and enjoyable way.",1443657600,8,1144,4.252293577981652

Catherine Zeta Jones was perfect in her part.  I often don't like Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, or Queen Latifa,  but on this viewing I thought they were all quite good.  OReilly is always a first rate actor.  I was bored by the Book of Mormon and thought I had outgrown musicals, but this proved me wrong.",1441065600,,554,4.300970873786408

1468946,5,B00005JLSE,"Even though I don't watch too many musicals, I've ended up liking the handful I've seen. That trend continues with CHICAGO, which is possibly the best modern musical I've seen (to differentiate it from classic Hollywood musicals of the 1950's-1960's). Since it's been out for over 10 years, most people probably know the basic plot. Set in 1920's Chicago, it's about a woman who murders her lover, gets sent to prison and uses the publicity to become a tabloid sensation and star. Everything about the film is just spectacular, from the sets and costumes, the musical numbers, to the singing and performances. Who knew that Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere could sing and dance so well? The film also has some great (if a little on-the-nose) commentary about corruption in the justice system and opportunists who are just out for their 15 minutes of fame. Richard Gere was perfect as the slimy lawyer who always gets his clients off...as long as he gets paid. Catherine Zeta-Jones was also good as a jazz sensation whose better days are behind her, and Renee Zellweger provided nice counterpoint as an ingenue looking to break into the biz. Even the way the film is constructed was pretty innovative. All of the musical numbers take place in the minds of the characters (except for the opening and closing numbers) so that the basic plot can maintain a sense of realism. There was also a kinetic energy in the way the musical numbers were filmed and edited that made them really pop off the screen. Overall, with some classic Kander/Ebb tunes, great performances and pointed commentary on fame and the justice system, CHICAGO is a film I can see myself returning to again and again.",1427587200,5,1704,4.859106529209622

Chicago portrayed it exactly how I like to picture it, except when I picture it theres a lot less murder involved. The plot was absolutely brilliant. They maintained a story line that consisted of suspense that made me eager to know what is happening next. All the actors and actresses were well fitting for each role played; all wore costumes that were beautifully detailed.  The music was amazing and with every song outburst I got more chills than the last one. I didn't want the film to end, but even when it did I started it back and watched it all over again.  I was extremely impressed with the actors and actresses in this film. Just thinking about the hours they had to put into making this film gives me a headache.

Zelleweger, while good, is the one who dragged it down for me this past time I watched it.  I like her....I jst think the first few times I watched it I was caught up in the movie and didn't realize that her performance was on the weak side.

The truth is, this movie left me feeling seriously depressed and just plain icky. Is the acting great? Of course, look who's in it. Are the songs well done? Yes. But this isn't the point. The actual story is what got me. Everyone who is hearald in this film are just plain scum bags. Murderers, liers, you name it. This movie says, as long as you have money and can bribe someone at the top (or afford a top attroney) you will get off and probably make it rich and famous (hence the ending). There are no character archs, they learn nothing in the end. The only innocent person in this film gets executed in prison because she didn't have the money. So.....is this how life really works? Maybe. But I don't live life like that and I personally don't want to watch 2 hours that glorify garbage.

1469994,5,B00005JLSE,"*For the plot, please read other reviews, as I wish to only comment on the other facets of this film. Chicago (2002) is a musical film starring Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere. It is energetic, humorous, slick, sexy, and the pace is just right. This movie never drags at any point; it's a fast hour and 53 minutes. This film naturally has several musical numbers interspersed to reflect the parts of the plot. This approach is unique, as well as powerful. This film for the most part captures the Chicago of yesteryear (during the jazz age), though I would've liked to have seen more of the city. For a musical, it certainly has a rhythm and cadence to it, which makes it all work. Some musicals make the mistake of slowing down, and appearing too long-winded with an excess of plot. And did I say that the acting is superb, with all three main characters having tremendous presence? Chicago is pure entertainment, and a 'fun' film. Overall, it's an unforgettable movie experience. 9/10",1406073600,,1010,4.777142857142858

No, absolutely not, broadway is so one dimensional.  You've probably got 3 or 4 different sets in which to perform and that's it !
I was never more aware of that statement when I went to see Mama Mia on the stage... I think there was 3 different sets on the stage.
The actors and actresses were trying to compensate for the lack of scenery and it was just pathetic...

I know that's not the real name, but that's what i always call it, and I'm sure anyone whose ever seen it knows what I'm talking about from me saying that.  Great movie, great cast.

1470542,5,B00005JLSE,"First, an important note: Amazon has a policy of combining ALL reviews of ALL formats of a movie title and posts on all those formats. So, it is important to sort reviews by ""Current first"" and then look to see which format the review is commenting on (it's there). As of today there are over 1300 reviews posted under this title but none - to my knowledge - are of the new 2014 Blu ray version Diamond Edition of this wonderful musical. So this may be the first. Also be aware that - to my knowledge - the Amazon Instant version may include the newly restored print (which is on the new BD set - but does not contain any of the ""Bonus material"" which - as you will see here - is SUBSTANTIAL.  With that said, on to the review.

It honestly is not good use of your time for me to discuss the film itself here.  For that, you might want to choose ""Most Helpful"" and read those reviews. So I won't discuss the plot, musical number, etc here if they were on the earlier releases. Also, you should know that there are two discs in the new package. One is a standard DVD and is virtually the same as the previous  DVD release with a full length Director's Commentary and a featurette on going from the Broadway stage version to the film version. Plus there is one song that was deleted from the film. Heck that is a lot of bonus material....... But wait.

The other disc is a Blu ray which contains the gorgeous new ""HD"" print with even better sound. (Since, when I watched the original DVD of this film, it was on a standard-def TV I wasn't seeing much anyway. Now with my larger 42-inch HD screen it looks great. But that's not all. The package cover states that there are ""Over two ours of NEW bonus material"".  I wasn't sure if this was a ploy - after all the film runs just under two hours - but they were right. The BD disc contains a new multi-part documentary that covers nearly all aspects of the film (casting, screenwriting, costuming, and auditions) and runs 2 hours and 20 minutes! The longest section is the 33-minute one on casting each major actor.  All of them were recently interviewed as well as the creative team.  Yes, there are obviously clips from the film to illustrate the comments but the interviews take up most of the time.  I will warn you that this is a ""love fest"" and you will hear nary a negative comment. You will hear a lot of ""he/she was PERFECT"", ""He/she is astounding"" and ""he/she is a remarkable singer/dancer/actor"".  It's almost too positive and the superlatives fly a bit too often. But you will certainly know more than you ever expected to about this film and Broadway musical fans will love every minute of it. But that's NOT all the ""bonus material"". Really! The BD has a slew of ""extended musical numbers"" and a few ""rehearsals"" too. If I counted correctly, there are nine of these, each running about 3- minutes except for the jail cell number which goes on for eight minutes. Because Director Rob Marshall often cut action into the musical numbers, we can now see them without interruption. (Side note - if only Francis Ford Coppola would release the music and dance numbers he filmed for ""The Cotton Club"", this reviewer would be a happy camper. It's never been released and the editing in the film destroys the performance by music legends.)

So there you have it. Would I recommend that those who have the prior DVD  ""upgrade"" to this new set? If you are a music theater or Hollywood musicals but, ABSOLUTELY - both for the print and the ne bonuses. If you have only seen the film in the theater or on Amazon Instant, and liked it, then yes too! You'll have a better understanding.  Then if you had a previous configuration, pass that one on to someone who hasn't seen the film and you just might introduce them to what a film version of a Broadway musical should be!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

1470808,5,B00005JLSE,".. the truth?  Atypical! ;-)

It's about time they made a really good musical film.

Pros: This blu-ray is accompanied with several audio tracks.  Blu-ray PCM 5.1 channel 24 bit, AAC Compressed Dolby Digital 16 bit, PCM 2.0 channel 24 bit, PCM 2.0 channel 16 bit .

Cons: About the only musical performed without interruptions, appears to be Cell Block Tango.  This Blu-ray version (and likely DVD versions as well) do not include the musicals in their entirety without interruptions.  The musical features included are a split view of their making and final performances with director and actor comments.  With the availability of the PCM 5.1 24 bit audio streams, it would have been really nice to provide the musical performances so people would not have to also buy the CD soundtrack.  Or, the CD/DVD soundtrack should have been included with the movie!

For people whom purchased the Blu-ray and you're computer literate, can likely extract the Cell Block Tango audio using the following after legally copying the relevant audio stream.  In other words, 1380 is the start position and 18480 (start pos + t offset) is the ending position.  (Otherwise if you're wanting the audio only musicals, will need to also buy the soundtrack CD.)

ffmpeg -i stream.wav -ss 1380 -t 460  -acodec copy  CellBlockTango.wav

When dealing with music Blu-ray media, I usually extract all available stream types (ie. PCM 5.1, PCM 2.0 24 bit, PCM 2.0 16 bit, AAC/AC3/A52 Dolby/DTS) and divide each song into their individual tracks.  I do this for all my music media, and reserve hunting for the original media for Movie DVD's and Blu-rays, with Blu-rays being optional as I have no choice but to convert them as I use Linux.  (God how I dislike Blu-ray media and HDMI!  But am pro copyright here as people have to make a living.)",1384732800,3,1814,4.850162866449511
1470809,5,B00005JLSE,"This is a highly entertaining movie, and a most successful adaptation of a theatrical musical.

The acting, direction, music and visualisation are superb.

Anyone who has seen movie versions of stage productions has witnessed how difficult it can be to make the transition from theater to cinema. Rob Marshall has made that transformation in a most imaginative and original way- having the movie glide from the gritty reality of 1920s era Chicago to a fantasy world- then back again.

The singing and dancing is excellent.

This is a textbook example of how to film a musical- and it stands a second viewing.

Highly recommended",1384560000,,628,5.0
1470810,5,B00005JLSE,"It's easy to agree with most of the other comments (pro and con) regarding this production, except that my DVD played perfectly.
Compared to the two other film versions of Roxie's saga, (the silent 1927 'Chicago' and the black and white 1941 'Roxie Hart'  version) which treated the sleazier aspects of the story rather daintily, in this telling, the 'gloves come off '.  The performers all acquit themselves well enough but ... somewhere in my video collection, I have a clip of Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera performing on a Tony Awards broadcast and against that, the performers in the film, as fine as they are, pale somewhat.  My main disappointments with this version, are that  1. Mary Sunshine is played by a woman and her song is deleted ...  I guess that would have been too 'decadent' even for Hollywood, aside from being too much of a distraction on the  big screen ... and  2.  The song 'Class' is also gone from the film proper (it is, however, included in the special features).  The other fiddling with the score are distracting, but not really a detriment.  Also, the 'vaudeville act' aspect of the original Broadway show is somewhat muddied but handled fairly well as the film slides from reality to  performing.  The 'making of ...'  featurette is interesting.  I look forward to watching  the movie again, this time with Director Rob Marshall's commentary track.",1384560000,2,1380,4.812765957446809

This production was awesome due to the amazingly powerful performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger--who'd a thunk they were song and dance dynamos? While I always love what sexy Richard Gere does, IMO he didn't deliver like the girls did. Now put Hugh Jackman in there and it's a trifecta!! And this was based upon a true story. Love Chicago's 'colorful' past, to say the least, and love all local shots, and the down-to-earth grittiness of it's residents. It's also the ""City With the Big Shoulders""--people from all over the world have said that 'Chicago and Chicagoans are friendly and helpful and it's one of the most beautiful metropolises in the world.

Not knowing about the original musical, I had no idea about what the plot would be. I expected it to be like the more current film, The Artist. It would document the jazz age and how it changed through the years. But BOY, I was sure wrong! This film is about the scandalous and dirty celebrity life of the 1920's Jazz Age. I was shocked, fascinated, and disgusted, by the characters and events in this movie. But at the same time, I found humor and fun in it.

I especially loved the concept of a jazz show narrating the movie as it went along. It took me a minute to grasp what was going on. How strange for a current movie! I also enjoyed the casting.

The film, Chicago, is the best of them all.  The performances are flawless and the rendition of the great songs of this show are musically, vocally, and visually memorable.  This is a great show and a great movie.",1373760000,,378,4.28169014084507

1471152,5,B00005JLSE,"Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and John C Reilly were really great in their roles. I particularly liked the way the musical numbers were staged. Most were triggered by Roxie going into day-dreaming mode; John C Reilly's number being the primary exception.  The fact that all of the singing and dancing was actually done by these actors made it even more enjoyable for me. Catherine won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, and I certainly agree with the Academy on that.

View the movie and then watch the extras about the making of the film and about the actors.

I first purchased this DVD right after it was released. However, I loaned it out and never got it back. I missed watching it and decided to see if anyone had it available and located it on Amazon. Received it in a few days.",1369785600,,825,4.636986301369863

1471216,3,B00005JLSE,"It came quickly and I thought in the condition in which it was represented. But immediately it started to skip. Had I complained right away, perhaps they would have helped me out. I said nothing, so it's really more my fault than theirs. And I do not believe I damaged it in any way; I think it came like that. But since I said nothing, I didn't give them a chance to make the situation better either. So I can't and won't bash them for something that I think was, but may not have been, their fault. I think I'd feel comfortable buying from them again... it simply COULD have been MY fault and none of theirs.",1369440000,,610,4.222222222222222

1471259,4,B00005JLSE,It's a terrific musical and I watched it for the third time. Actually I don't like musical usually but this one is really great. And the fact that the choreography is done by Bob Fosse does a lot for the dancing scenes. Definitely worth seeing at least once.,1367625600,,258,4.395833333333333
1471260,5,B00005JLSE,I had seen the orginal stage play plus the movie.

The story is so well done,  and the characters are so well written.  Ahh,  Billy Flynn,  Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly.  The trio you just love to hate.  I especially loved the 'Razzle Dazzle' sequence.  You can just feel the sheer disgust the writer had for these characters,  who were based off of real people and real situations.

I saw Chicago when it first came out but had forgotten how incredible Chicago's dancing routines are.  The fact that only one of the three stars ever trained as a dancer and the other two had learned their routines under Rob's tuition and performed them so amazingly well makes the film even more worth seeing.

While some may argue (including me) that The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was the better movie, that is not to take away from the excellence of the film.  Both Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones shine in their roles and Queen Latifah isn't far behind.  John C. Reilly shows he can excel in any genre of film.  Richard Gere is a very stiff in the musical numbers, but he brings the right amount swarm to his lawyer character.

Renee Zellweger plays a wannabe chorus girl that dreams life around her in terms of theatrical sets. She would not hurt a worm, but in an instant of artistic indifference discovers that although 'he' thinks he is alive 'she' thinks him dead. The murder that follows sets the theme for this genre.

In its broadest sense, the film is about American innocence seen through the actions of the not-so-innocent, about life in times of murder, greed, and bedlam.

Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a dancer who had an act with her sister until she found her sister and her lover in bed together and shot them both. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a girl in the chorus who had an affair with a furniture dealer because he claimed he could get her a job in a swank nightclub. When she discovered he was lying and he laughed at her, she shot him, then tried to get her auto mechanic husband to take the blame.

They met in prison where the matron, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) is doing quite a business in selling favors of various kinds, and apparently collecting them, too. She recommends Roxie see defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who has never lost a case. Turns out he's Velma's attorney, too.

That's the outline of the story, and of course we have a courtroom scene. But what is slightly disorienting is that people burst into song and dance all the time, everywhere. Might make you think of Jailhouse Rock or Cry Baby. Still, as I say, the dancing is red hot, as is the jazz, and the costumes are mostly very small and sparkly. All in all, it's a lot of fun, and makes me think again about the fashion dolls Robert Tonner made from the main characters.

I had the pleasure to watch the Broadway play one year before the movie's release and I was totally amazed by it; and I repeat, I'm not a fan of musicals.

The plot is the less important thing in these kind of movies but ""Chicago"" has a witty, funny, and sexy plot that will get your attention.

But let's be honest, we watch this movie for it's musical numbers and choreography. You won't be disappointed because every single musical number is spectacular and very well done.

When this ends, Zellweger has an argument which leads to the man she had sex with abusing her. She pulls out a gun and kills him in a fit of rage. She gets arrested and ends up in a woman's prisoner led by Queen Latifah. Much of the movie makes up of the actresses' lip singing (which can be seen very clearly) and wearing exotic costumes that make them look like whores. So I think to myself, is this supposed to be about a woman imprisoned and trying to prove her innocence, or a bunch of bad singing and sexual immorality? Or, a movie that's about the glorification of women killing man and saying it's okay?",1336176000,,1237,4.412280701754386

The 1.85:1 video presentation was actually pretty good.  There were some dark scenes that had grain, but the majority of the movie looked very good.

Sound was only Dolby Digital 5.1, which was pretty good.  I don't know if the 2011 Release has DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.

The movie was about 50% drama, and 50% dance/musical performances.  If you don't like broadway shows, you probably shouldn't purchase this movie.  It is about an hour and 50 minutes long.",1332115200,,780,4.654411764705882

The movie opens at a nightclub. A young woman returns for her turn on stage, and sings. Roxie watches from the audience, then leaves with her boyfriend for her apartment. Did Fred lie to her? A bad career move. The police show up to question the husband and wife. Then we get a song to interrupt the story. The victim was a furniture salesman known to them. Was Amos a sap for confessing? ""I'd kill him again!"" ""Once is enough."" Roxie is brought to ""Murderess' Row"" in Cook County Jail. Then we hear a song. [The changing format suggests a split personality.] ""He had it coming"" isn't entertaining or interesting, it just pads out the movie. ""Murder is a form of entertainment in Chicago."" The all-male juries never hanged a woman. [Not true.] Roxie needs a good lawyer: Billy Flynn never lost a case. [Did he only take the cases he could win?]

Billy Flynn wants $5,000 to represent a client (love doesn't pay his bills). This ""satire"" doesn't amuse me. Amos stands by Roxie. Do they mock defense lawyers? Can they raise money for the defense by selling items owned by the accused? Can they generate sympathy with a story about her life? Rehearsing the witness' story? [They all do that; a trial is like a play where the audience decides on success or failure.] The song by Roxie seems deliberately tasteless. The next song plods along, and isn't funny or entertaining. [Was this deliberate?] Velma sings and dances. ""Lay off the caramels."" Next Billy gets another client. [An unbelievable story.] Miss Baxter seems unusually feisty for a millionaire heiress. A tasteless story? Another boring song that takes up too much time. Is the defendant's dress and demeanor part of the act? Does the conflict between Roxie and Billy seem real? Another tasteless act with Catalina. [What is wrong with the writers?]

The trial of Roxie Hart begins. ""I'm scared."" Is it all show business or another tasteless and ignorant statement? Roxie explains her ""illicit relations"". Is she well-rehearsed? What an act! ""There ain't no justice in this world!"" There is a surprise witness in court. [A jailhouse snitch?] The cross-examination of Velma Kelly is educational. [Note how this `evidence' was developed.] And so the jury delivers a verdict. [Would married men have sympathy for a man who fools with a married woman?] Then there are shots on the courthouse steps. Another sensation to capture the attention of newspaper readers. Billy Flynn never lost a case. [Did he access that diary?] And so ""Andy"" returns to his world, and this overlong musical comes to an end. ""Isn't it grand?"" Is there a future for Velma and Roxie? There is no business like show business.

I'll bet the original 1927 drama was better than this expensive production. Maurine Watkins wrote this play as a drama student at Yale. She had been a reporter for the Chicago `Tribune', and not in sympathy with the true crime cases used as a basis for her play. ""The Girls of Murder City"" is more educational and entertaining than this musical. Some people say they got away with ""murder"" but if you can justify a killing it is not murder.

1472037,5,B00005JLSE,"I have to give credit to director Rob Marshall - he and his crew did a fantastic job bringing my favorite musical to the big screen. I live in Chicago and cannot be impartial. Tough act when you've seen this show on Broadway multiple times and understand ""Chicago"" transmits best when live on stage. I loved Marshall's idea to have the musical numbers play out in Roxie's head and this is one of the many reasons that it works. The sets and costumes are wonderful too. Now I feel that the negative reviews are plain unfair. Casting was right on. The stars, Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Gere are actors and not professional Broadway thespians. And many Broadway thespians will never be Hollywood A-list movie stars. With exception of Zeta-Jones whom is a talented dancer/singer, both Zellweger and Gere had a lot of courage to sign up for this film. Neither had attempted a musical before. All three actors really outdid themselves and the hard work paid off. Watch Gere's footwork in the tap dance scene and also his opening number ""All I Care About is Love."" Catherine's ""All That Jazz"" rivals Bebe Neuwirth. And Renee was the biggest surprise of all for me. I loved her renditions of ""Funny Honey"" and ""Nowadays.""
Queen Latifah was hilarious as Mama Morton.

The musical was based on a book by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse and was choreographed by Fosse. Fosse's next film project was to have been to make the musical into a movie, but he died before the project was begun, which shelved the project. Rob Marshall revived interest in the film project with his idea of casting the events of the film through the eyes of Roxie Hart. We can be glad that the film project was revived, because Rob Marshall has created a truly wonderful movie. What a talented cast!!

1472234,4,B00005JLSE,"You can credit `Chicago' with bringing the beloved musical back into our lives, even if it doesn't really deserve the full credit.  Just the year before the marvelous (and superior) `Moulin Rouge!' managed an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and surely paved the way for `Chicago' to win the Oscar.  The year before that `art house' master Lars von Trier gave us the brilliant `Dancer in the Dark', and while it didn't manage a Best Picture nomination, it caused a major stir with the critics and definitely got a lot of people talking.  So, what I guess I'm trying to say is that, while `Chicago' is regarded as the musical of this generation, it didn't capture that title on its own merits.

It is a great film, truly absorbing and thoroughly entertaining; but it is far from the best musical of this generation.

Taking a saucy stage play and giving it its due on the big screen is a big undertaking.  I have seen the stage play a few times and devour it every time; it's that stunningly entertaining.  For me, and this should really go for nearly everyone, a musical lives and dies with the VOICES carrying the songs.  If someone cannot sing, they should NOT be in a musical.

I wanted to get that out of the way.

The film tells the story of Roxie Hart, the aspiring singer who gets a little carried away during a lovers spat and takes a man's life.  Claiming self defense, Roxie gets help from attorney Billy Flynn, who capitalizes off her story to get publicity.  Roxie's doting husband Amos waits in the shadows as his wife's popularity grows, but when Roxie finds herself being `forgotten' by the public she has to go to even greater extremes to keep their attention.

I really liked the way that director Gary Marshall constructed the film.  It has this out of body quality to the musical numbers, which makes sense in the setting.  It gives it a very `showy' feel that gives the illusion of watching a cabaret variety show.  This approach is needed to give the film some style; style that suits the premise and atmosphere.

The film is very `razzle dazzle'.

As far as the performances are concerned, there is a lot of love here.  Thank GOD Catherine Zeta-Jones won the Oscar for her dynamic portrayal of the washed up Velma Kelly.  She ravishes on screen and just completely engulfs every scene she is in.  Her `song and dance' pleading with Roxie is sensational to put it lightly.  She clearly outshines the rest of the cast, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the cast falters.  A lot has been said about Renee Zellweger and her lack of singing talent.  Like I said, a musical must be judged on the VOICES carrying the songs, but in this case, it is that lack of talent that works in her favor.  She is an aspiring singer, and one gets the impression that she is aspiring because she lacks the talent to really survive.  She is arrogant and pretty confident, but the fact remains that she hasn't made it.  She needs this trial to become a star, and that speaks volumes for her natural talent.  I adore Zellweger here.

As far as voices go, one doesn't get much better than Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly.  They are the best vocals in the bunch, yet sadly they give the most mediocre performances.  I love Reilly, and in 2002 he had a stellar year (appearing in THREE Best Picture nominees; `Chicago', `Gangs of New York' and `The Hours', as well as the independent film `The Good Girl').  His Supporting Actor nomination at the Oscars was clearly a nod to his success as an actor, but he was nominated for the wrong film.  His subdued and emotional work in `The Good Girl' should have nabbed him the nomination.  Latifah has a showier role, and her `vavavavoom' performances really add some color to the film; but she's sadly lacking in screen time.

Reading that they once considered Kevin Spacey for the role of Flynn makes me a little sad, since he is not only a stunning actor but a brilliant singer and he would have chewed this up (and may have even walked away with an Oscar) but the lackluster Richard Gere took on the role and just does NOTHING for me here.  His voice is very mediocre, his performances are awkward and while I actually found his quick witted delivery in his spoken scenes to be entertaining he just never really comes together as a complete character to me.

I was put off.

The film can at times be all over the place, but it makes up for it with ample amounts of style that get poured all over every scene like syrup.  It works.  Yes, it is overrated, but that doesn't mean it doesn't prove itself a visual feast and a memorable experience.  When you look at the year that was 2002 you instantly think of `Chicago', and rightfully so.  Sure, `The Pianist' was a much better film, but `Chicago', without a doubt, is the one you are going to want to watch again and again and again.

And BTW, those set pieces and costumes are all sorts of spectacular!",1256688000,,4900,4.495475113122172

What makes the movie very special is that it highlights all the characters and doesn't take the light away from the leads: Roxan, Velma, and the attorney.

Certainly, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere shine together but great direction by Rob Marshall enhances a perfect plot and makes every character a star including the deceived husband, prison mates and even Velma who's annoyingly played by the equally annoying Zeta-Jones.",1252540800,,651,4.8558558558558556

1472324,3,B00005JLSE,"Where to begin. The actors I suppose, just to get that out of the way. I hated Renee Zellweger. On the other hand, everyone else was good. But I don't think Lucy Liu should've gotten the billing she did (Christine Baranski [who is a much better singer AND actor than Zellweger] and Taye Diggs were in the film much more than what she was and all she said was five lines). Zellweger definitely can't sing, though I will admit that she was OK on Nowadays. Her vocals are like nails on a chalkboard for me and I can plainly see why she didn't get hardly any of the awards she was nominated for. Which leads into my praise for Jones. Even people who know she has an accent can't tell. Her songs are sung very well and it makes me glad that she sings the majority compared to her costar. Richard Gere, I guess, for me anyway as he was the only one who acted (even Jones looked like she was just smiling and not even emoting when she was on screen), stole the show. The songs are good, I like Jones, Gere, Reilly (who's actually a good actor/singer when he's not making a crappy comedy with Will Ferrell) and Latifah (she's a favorite but it seems a little unfair to compare her to the others as she was already a singer before she got the role). Along with Zellweger, the other major problem I have with this picture is that the songs don't come naturally from the scene (except for All That Jazz, When You're Good To Mama, Razzle Dazzle, Class and the end finale). Unlike other musicals like Sgt. Pepper, The Blues Brothers and Mamma Mia, the people in this film don't burst spontaneously into song. They announce that they're going to go into song, making the story, which flows very nicely, come to a complete halt when a song like Funny Honey, Cell Block Tango, Roxie or I Can't Do It Alone is performed. Roxie comes along and then whoever's singing the song is put upon a stage to sing and we cut back and forth between the performance and the story, proving, at least in my opinion that this musical was never really meant to leave the stage if all they're doing is singing on a stage anyway. I know they're supposed to represent some fantasy world of Roxie's but I highly doubt that anyone would have a fantasy (a seven or eight minute fantasy at that) about the women in the prison singing about how they got there (which in my opinion should've come before Latifah's number to show just how uncomfortable Roxie is in the prison).",1236643200,,2433,4.384955752212389

Richard Gere was great as the manipulative, money-hungry, publicity-grabbing laywer Billy Flynn working to get Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) off of a murder charge. John C.

But Zellweger really steals the show. Well, along with Zeta-Jones' super performances.

Nonetheless, Chicago is a rollicking, foot-tapping, hot musical that doesn't apologize for its direction and content.  Roxie Hart is a naive but strong-willed young woman who's determined to be famous.  Velma Kelly is a veteran of the stage but is sparsely rewarded despite her dedication and talent.  The two eventually collide when Roxie begins winning hearts (and the press) with her story while Velma must face the reality that she's yesterday's news.  The slick lawyer not only must juggle Roxie's front page case but also the restless Kelly who is chagrined that even her own attorney begins to turn his back on her.

1472428,5,B00005JLSE,"I've always been interested in this movie, but not sure what I think of it.  Technically it has earned its award in my book, and also has earned a five star rating.  But if the stars were used in my case to reflect how much I liked it, it would be a two.  I checked it out from the library, watched the first 45 minutes, and then fast forwarded to the final half hour, seeing the trial and ending to know how things came out.

One person rightly said there are hardly any redeemable characters in it.  The protagonist is an adulterous murderer who thinks only of herself.  It questions if there is any real judgment.

I would compare this to ""A Clockwork Orange"".  Both show the depths of depravity.  The difference?  The Kuberick classic reflects the emptiness of the depravity, while ""Chicago"" has fun with it.

I thought the blur between reality and fantasy was very effective, which added both to its uniqueness and its disturbing quality.  I loved the acting as well.  There were also some good points, such as the lawyer telling Rene's character that she should be happy with her freedom.  Too many people are not happy with what we should be happy with.

One thing I missed was the conviction of the foreign girl.  I found that hanging scene very depressing, and I did miss why she was convicted.

Another reviewer said ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"" stick with you, and he was right.

This was a well done movie, but it is one I would have been fine not seeing.  Just because it is good art does not mean it is good.",1209254400,,1532,4.4071428571428575

The movie (unlike the musical theater production) has absolutely gorgeous costumes and goes into much more detail about the story so that you understand completely what is happening.  Rob Marshall did such an amazing job with this movie - the musical numbers being part of Roxie's imagination was a great touch.

Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly were perfect in their roles (as were everyone else!).  I had no idea that most of these people could sing and dance like that!  Listening to the soundtrack gets me every time - those wonderful Kander and Ebb songs are sung so right on!

I also love the Razzle Dazzle edition of the movie because of the awesome special features.  Going behind all the musical numbers and seeing rehearsals for them makes you realize just how much work went into this movie.  And I loved the Chita Rivera and Liza Minelli extras!

1472488,5,B00005JLSE,"Bob Fosse's Chicago was initially produced as an unpretentious musical during the mid seventies and rumor has it that was intended to launch the career of ""Bob's leading ladies"".  It played for three years in Broadway and had a huge comeback during the nineties after the controversial O J Simpson case and it is still playing.

A simple plot of murder, lust and injustice with minimalistic staging that became a hit movie in 2002, winning several Oscars including Best Movie and Best Actress (Katherine Z-Jones as Velma Kelley).  Other excellent actors were hired for the movie including Queen Latifah (the prison matron), Renee Zellweger (Roxie Heart) and Richard Gere (lawyer Flint).  Note that Chita Rivera (which was in the original musical), appears briefly in the movie as an inmate of the jail.

This 2002 movie, by by Rob Marshall and Martin Richards, masterfully arranges a complex setting which constantly changes from the Chicago's Cook County Jail to the Club where the musical numbers are performed; similar to Liza Minelli's Cabaret.  But unlike Cabaret, the glitz and glamour make it a superb production.

1472572,2,B00005JLSE,"After many years of wanting to see this film, I finally got a chance to view it. I like musicals and loved Moulin Rouge, so I thought I'd give this one a try. However, after viewing, I was a bit puzzled at all the fuss and acclaim this movie received and continues to receive.

Chicago, while visually stunning and artistically impressive (in that the actors did their own singing), is a shallow, cynical, superficial, and unsympathetic story. Most movies rely upon story and plot for their strength; not so Chicago, whose only redeeming quality is the song and dance they put on.

The main problem with the story is that there are virtually no sympathetic main characters. To take that a step further, the main characters are all frauds, and the story's message is shallow. The two somewhat redeeming characters, Roxie's husband and the woman who is hanged, are both pretty much invisible and discarded in the film. Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly are both in jail for murder, and both have hopes and dreams of making it, being a big star, and having people adore them, so they call upon a slimebag attorney, Billy Flynn, to help them out. Roxie and Velma take turns lying and deceiving each other so they can get the fame in Chicago. Roxie openly admits she cheated on her husband, is oblivious to the fact that he's spent his life savings to get her a lawyer, and uses every trick in the book  (including pretending that she has an illegitimate child) to ensure that she is the center of the newspaper headlines. Velma is a conceited fame-hungry snob who bribes the prison ward and only sucks up to Roxie when she realizing she is losing the fame war. From here we have a battle over popularity, as the two think of shenanigans to steal the headlines from each other. Who will win out? Who cares.

The message basically projected in this film is that its legitimate to whatever it takes to get ahead in this world--lie, cheat, steal, commit adultery--and, in fact, it might make you a star!

Are we are suppose to root for two back-stabbing, deceitful, murderesses who walk over people just to get their claim to fame all because they can sing and dance? Or how about a double-crossing, pompous, lying, money-hungry lawyer looking for the next damsel charged with murder? No thanks. I say throw them all in jail.

Watching this film, I found it mystifying how so many people and critics could love this movie so much. Granted the story's plot has probably changed from the musical version on stage, but the movie version falls quite short of its glowing reviews. Moreover, how could this film have received six Oscars in 2002? I liken the Oscar committee of 2002 to the gullible Chicago citizens in the film, falling over and swooning at something that puts on a little song and dance. Maybe Chicago was the Academy Award's apology for Moulin Rouge not getting any Oscars the previous year.

If you want to see a musical that is vastly superior, has heart, style and substance, and better acting, see Moulin Rouge.",1182988800,3,3012,4.661016949152542
1472573,5,B00005JLSE,"I've seen this movie DVD several times already, and each time I like it more.  In fact, I think it's the best film musical I've ever seen.  The songs--one right after another, the spectacular dancing, the two gorgeous women--what more could you ask.  Although I've never been a fan of Richard Gere (I know women are), I thought he was terrific here, singing and dancing.

The biggest surprise, however, is Renee Zellweger.  I've liked most of her movies where she played dramatic roles.  Song and dance were not her bag, but she was great and deserved a highest award for the accomplishment in this movie.  Her ""Roxie"" number and the finale duo were sensational.  Then there is Catherine Zeta Jones who received and deserved an Academy Award for this movie.  I never saw anyone tear the place up before as she did in ""All That Jazz"" and even moreso in ""I Can't Do It Alone.""

1472575,5,B00005JLSE,"This is one of my very favorite movie musicals. The songs are so great and so much fun!

My favorite part about this movie though, is the way in which it constantly cuts back and forth between simultaneous shots of what the characters are doing in the ""movie"" version and what they are doing in the ""stage"" version of the story. It is this symmetrical blending of the two arts that really appeals to me, and the cinematography is very well done.

Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah all put on award-winning performances. I was especially impressed with Gere's and Reilly's performances. (Lucy Liu's small part was nice simply because she is so gorgeous, LOL, but she really is only a brief side character.)

This is the best and most enjoyable stage-musical-to-movie adaptation that I have yet seen, and I highly recommend it. Is it the best movie-musical ever? Probably not, I'd have to vote for The Sound Of Music, but even so, I find myself watching Chicago more often than TSOM.

1472580,4,B00005JLSE,"I love ""Chicago"". How do I know that? I've seen it twice in the theater, the friend of mine downloaded it for me from the Internet, and gave me CDs for my b-day, and I bought a DVD when it finally became available.

Well, it may not be nearly as perfect as the Broadway revival - the plot, the cinematography, and the chronologically incorrect details - but it is a good sparkling entertainment, and I believe that wherever he is, Bob Fosse would be pleased with this screen adaptation of one of his beloved musicals.

First of all, Chicago did not take itself too seriously - there are a lot of details that were reused from Bob Fosse's himself (the All That Jazz number was done like an opening scene in Cabaret, Velma's playing with the chair in I Can't Co It Alone - also). Roxie's Funny Honey with her laying seductively on the great piano in the pink dress is a reverence to the Michelle Pfeiffer's ""Makin' Whoopee"" number in the Fabulous Baker Boys. Whatever Roxie was doing while she performed that song was not just a singing; it was a very good acting. And there was Billy Flint (Richard Gere), the silver tongue, the prince of the court rooms - and his scenes, the clever and funny satire on the TV and big screen court room dramas and comedies (Billy: ""Objection!"" - ADA Harrison:""But Your Honor, I have not even asked any question""!).

Second, ""Chicago"" surprised me. I was not the biggest fan of the actors who played the main parts when I went to see it for the first time but I know good acting when I see it. With her first appearance in the opening interpretation of ""All That Jazz"" , Katherine Zeta-Jones just blew me away - the woman can sing and dance, and she had a lot of fun doing it. She was born to play Velma. When the actors have fun enjoying what they are doing - I as a viewer appreciate it and enjoy watching them - which is important, right? The following scenes were as delightful as the opening - Queen Latiffa as Mama Morton, the fantastic Cell Block Tango - people, look me in the eye and tell me that Cell Block Tango was not fun to watch and listen to? My personal favorite was: ""He was crazy, and he kept on screaming, ""You've been screwing the milkman."" And then he ran into my knife... he ran into my knife ten times.""

The film even touched me when John C. Reilly was doing his Mr. Cellophane's number - it actually showed in those three-four minutes the sadness and loneliness of a small man, maybe not very bright but decent and devoted one. The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.

There are a lot of people who do not like Renee Zellweger. I am not her fan, either, but I have to say that she did almost impossible in ""Chicago"" - she made people look at her when she and Zeta-Jones were on the screen together. She acted great, her character was changing constantly - from the sweet little housewife dreaming of fame to the frustrated and humiliated woman who killed her lover to the common heartless criminal who'll stop at nothing to receive money, power and fame. It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.

With all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again.

1472663,5,B00005JLSE,"This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.

The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.

Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.

In the jail, Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.

The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.

The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, ""When You're Good To Mama"" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.

The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, ""Mister Cellophane"", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his ""Razzle Dazzle"" number and his tap dancing.

I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for ""Best Picture"". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud.

1472667,4,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is a well- made musical production that tells the story of several vaudeville ladies in 1920's Chicago who compete for fame and fortune and are willing to sacrifice their reputations, sleep with different men, kill a few people, etc., to advance their careers. This movie was award with the Best Picture Oscar for 2002 and after watching it a couple of times, it is easy to see why it was considered for this prestigious award. The story presented in this musical is pretty good and it is packed with an all- star cast that includes performers like Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifa. With a combination of talent like that, a film has a good chance for success. And Chicago certainly does succeed on most levels with many excellent song and dance scenes and strong directing from Rob Marshall.

What makes a musical memorable is, of course, the music itself; in particular, the catchiness of the tunes, the presentation of the songs, and the integration of the songs within the context of the film. Among the many songs in this musical (about 18 of them), some of them are certainly better than others with the standouts being ""I Move On"", ""All I Care About"", and ""All that Jazz"". Many of the others are only average and I have already forgotten most of them- even after watching the movie two times. The way the songs are inserted into the movie, however, is very good and Rob Marshall deserves credit for timing the presentation of these tunes but even more impressive than the timing is the performances themselves. The dance scenes are hot, with Catherine Zeta- Jones and Renee Zellweger leading the way. Dozens of hot female bodies twist and turn to the music, making you quickly forget about quality of the songs themselves.

As far as the story goes, it isn't the greatest I have ever seen in a movie (musical or otherwise) but it is still pretty good. What I like best about it is the character development and the progression of the lead character, Roxie Hart, from down- and- out vaudeville wannabe to media darling and ultimately back to where she started. It is interesting to watch as Renee Zellweger's character goes from a sexually dissatisfied woman married to a very homely looking man to a murderess. She is concerned at first that she will spend her life behind bars for killing the man she was having an affair with. Then, realizing her media star power as a woman who shot and killed a man, she forgets about the murder and lavishes in the attention, only to see the spotlight ultimately shift to another person who has an even greater story to tell.

All of the performances in this movie are noteworthy and it is important to point out that Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Renee Zellweger, and the others perform the song and dance routines themselves. There is no lip- syncing or dubbed music here. The star performers prove they have earned their celebrity status by performing their own parts. Each of them is very good in their roles, especially Zellweger as the main character and John Reilly as her plain- looking, plain- spoken husband.

Overall, Chicago is a good musical with some hot dance scenes, good songs, and star performances all around. The movie ultimately looks slightly better then it sounds because not all of the songs are very memorable. But it is still a very good Hollywood musical and the first of its genre to win the Best Picture award in a more than thirty years.",1167091200,2,3465,4.722314049586777
1472668,5,B00005JLSE,"Altogether, it was wonderful.  I KNEW the choreography was by Bob Fosse, but thought he was retired or something, then saw someone else's name in the credits and figured I was wrong.  Then read some of these reviews and found that it at least derived from Fosse.  WHOEVER thought it up, it was stunning and exciting.  The lyrics were pedestrian with scads of false rhymes.  The music sounded like Cabaret rejects.  The only song (except those dreadful words) to write home about was the first one.  The rest were mediocre, but taken as a whole, concept, plot, songs, acting, dancing, AND DIRECTING it was wonderful.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  But sigh especially to anyone who liked the movie of Cabaret.  Kander and Ebb are at rock bottom of my list of songwriters, but I thought the score of the movie of Cabaret (not the Bway show) was brilliant, not a lemon in it.  Chicago and Cabaret are almost identical.  I searched through Netflix for another musical with Catherine Zetta-Jones (I loved her, especially with that haircut), but alas could find none.  She was glorious.  Richard Gere was great when he was acting serious, but (except for his ventriloquist number, which was wonderful) I didn't care for him in the fantasy episodes.  It's a sordid, morbid, CYNICAL story, but so was Cabaret (the rise of the nazis).  I'm seriously thinking about buying this movie, to have, to watch again (and maybe a few more agains after that).  Every person on the screen did a superlative job in his/her part.  One comment on another review.  I don't think Bway shows are all that wonderful on stage.  In fact, I don't think they're wonderful at all.  The music may be good (but usually it's not), the lyrics are invariably mediocre at best, most usually just bad, and the books are invariably long and boring as hell.  There are exceptions.  I saw a Noel Coward show (many times) I liked, and Rodgers' No Strings (1st show I ever saw onstage) enthralled me.  Of course, I was a child at the time, but I still love the songs.  Enough wool-gathering.  Chicago may not be for everyone, but I loved it.",1166400000,3,2096,4.658469945355192

Catherine Zeta-Jones IS Velma and Renee Zellweger IS Roxie Hart.
These two multi talented actresses are fabulous in their roles.
Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, their slick lawyer, showcases his talent as an actor and as a song and dance man.
The dummy (Roxie) and ventriloquist (Billy) number is my favorite!
The choreography of both that scene and the jailhouse dance segment is absolutely superb!

John C. Reilly was the perfect choice as Amos, Roxie's naive husband.
His rendition of Mr. Cellophane could not have been performed by anyone else. He owns that song!
 Queen Latifah as Mama Morton, the women's matron, was top notch and her song
'If You're Good To Mama' was done with just the right bawdiness.

1472670,5,B00005JLSE,"`Chicago' is one of those films that, while not my favorite, captivates me from start to finish every time I sit down to watch it.  It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle.  Yes, some of you have mentioned that the lead actors voices aren't the greatest, and really, other than the magnificent John C. Reilly and the superb Queen Latifah the singing is below par as far as you would expect Broadway to be (Zellwegger and Gere have nothing on 2001's Kidman and McGregor).  But that's not really the point, because all the glitter and glam and attitude that drips forward with every word you begin to forget the fact that these people can't really sing.

I for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast.  Renee did an outstanding job as Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of the big lights who murders her lover when he refuses to give her that.  She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Oscar winning role) who is currently serving time for offing her husband and sister.  Through Matron `Mamma' Morton (Queen Latifah in the role that should have given her the Oscar) Velma has been set up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, the best money can buy, and Roxie wants him too.  Left to pick up the bill is Roxie's loyal if not albeit nave husband Amos (Reilly in his Oscar nominated role...great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone.

The film of course revolves around the court case and Roxie's determination to work the crowd, work the judge, the jury and the world in order to not only be released of all charges but become a star.  She of course has obstacles every step of the way, between Velma's jealousy, Billy's fleeting interest and her husbands growing distain.  The real shining areas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number.  Numbers like `Cell Block Tango' and `All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like `Mister Cellophane' and `When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone.  One of my favorite numbers though is Catherine's `I Can't Do it Alone' just because of her sheer determination...she's wonderful.

`Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, `Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy.  Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that.  His direction here couldn't have been better.  `Chicago' is a film that will never grow old, never grow tired and never leave my collection.",1162512000,,2900,4.6660117878192535
1472741,5,B00005JLSE,"I never get tired seeing this beautiful production.  I find myself humming the music out of the clear blue sky not even thinking about  it.  I also just saw recently  Chicago in a local San Antonio, Texas presentation put on by a local group.  It was wonderful.  The group was quite professional and wonderful which prompted me to order this from you.  I had seen this movie maybe three or four times.  It's delightful and will always be well received.",1154995200,3,452,4.5625
1472742,5,B00005JLSE,"I haven't seen a cinematic musical so finely crafted and enjoyable since Singing in the Rain--Chicago is outstanding! Set in its namesake during a female murder spree, the costumes, sets, and atmosphere are right on target. The acting, singing, and dancing are so good chills will run down your spine. Renee Zellewegger is particularly inspired as Roxie, reminding me keenly of Marilyn Monroe. Queen Latifah and the remainder of the cast are equally up to the challenge, bringing Bob Fosse's musical to the screen in all its dark, glamorous glory.

Bottom line: Definitely, see it.",1153440000,2,581,5.11578947368421
1472743,5,B00005JLSE,"This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.

The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.

Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.

In the jail, Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.

The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.

The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, ""When You're Good To Mama"" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.

The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, ""Mister Cellophane"", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his ""Razzle Dazzle"" number and his tap dancing.

I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for ""Best Picture"". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud.

1472745,5,B00005JLSE,"Bob Fosse's ""Chicago"" is a spectacular and naughty musical.  Two Showgirls (Rene'e Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are put in the slammer for each murdering their lovers.  Their crimes of passion are presented as petty, but predictable in the Windy City during the Jazz Age.  The only regrets they have are the gallows, and their only deliverance is a greedy and conceited lawyer (played by Richard Gere).  Even though the women are desperate, they also crave the publicity that oddly gets them help from the papers if they know how to use it.

The drama moves from the prison to the stage where the singers unbear their souls for each key scene.  The numbers and choreography are steamy and smooth, and the story is entertaining.  The performances are good, but don't require any subtlety.  Queen Latifah is particularly fun as the female warden.  The scenes are interspersed well and flow at a good pace.  There is some cynicism in the story, but the playful antics overshadow the darker elements of the movie.",1148774400,2,1016,4.888888888888889

Well, I just don't think Renee is all that. I do love Latifah so I'll give her a pass, because she was probably forced to do this by her agent.

Gere is sly and charming as usual. And Zeta Jones is a doll. Man, I wish I could meet her after Michael Douglas passes on. She has everything I like about an actress. That voice? And the figure? What a knockout! Man, the things I could see myself and CZJ getting up to: Scrabble, Boogle, Uno, etc.

1472748,5,B00005JLSE,"Often when a Broadway musical is adapted to the screen, the original concept and story suffer.  This did not happen to this adaptation.  The true spirit of the musical is intact in this film.  In original production, the musical numbers were staged as a radio program. In the film, they are fantasy sequences staged at a nightclub.

As the film begins, Velma Kelly is arriving at the nightclub without her partners (sister who she performs with and husband.)  The reason is she just killed both of them!

Roxie Hart is at the club with her boyfriend Fred Casely.  And she sees Velma take the stage alone performing All That Jazz.  During the course of the song, we see Roxie and Fred's affair fizzle out, ending with Fred leaving and Roxie shooting him.  During this number, Roxie goes from reality to a fantasy world.  In this world, people comment on what is going on through the cabaret numbers.

Next we find the police detective arriving at the scene of the murder.  Roxie slips into her fantasy with Funny Honey.  Amos is covering for Roxie but when he finds out who is dead, he realizes what happens and hands Roxie over to the police.

Roxie arrives in the joint and meets Matron ""Mama"" Morton and she explains the rules (When You're Good to Mama.) (Look for the original Broadway Velma Kelly, Chita Rivera, in this scene.)

We get to meet the girls of Murder's Row in The Cell Block Tango.  Each describes what happened to land her on Murder's Row. (He ran into my knife, he ran into my knife ten times!)

Enter into the mix, the great murder attorney Billy Flynn.  Billy is Chicago's premiere defense attorney for women accused of murder.  He has never lost a case but he is not in it for the money ($5,000 per case) but All I Care About is love.

Billy decides to take on Roxie as a client but first, he must make her into a the a sympathetic character.  The best lies are based on truth and they embellish on Roxie's past but when it comes to the night in question well, We Both Reached for the Gun (this is particularly effective.  Roxie and all the reporters are just marionettes with Billy pulling the strings.

With her sudden fame, Roxie ponders what might be when she is acquitted.  Velma realizes that Roxie has taken her thunder and makes a desperate attempt to form an alliance because I Can't Do It Alone.  But Roxie quickly finds out that fame is fleeting when a heiress goes on a rampage and kills her boyfriend and his two playmates.

This is where Roxie shows that she is not a dumb blonde and creates a fake pregnancy.  And once again becomes #1 murderess but her husband realizes that he will always be Mister Cellophane.

As the trial approaches, Billy tells Roxie that trials are all Razzle Dazzle and everything is going fine until Velma is given Roxie's diary which has some damning passages.  This sends Billy into A Tap Dance.

In the end, both Roxie and Velma get off but Roxie still wants the fame and finds out that Chicago is crawling with murderesses and fame comes in pairs Nowadays and teams up with Velma.

This film is great on many levels.  As a screen adaptation of a musical, it is true to the source material.  The songs that were left out were because they did not fit the concept of the movie (See DVD extra Class).  As a commentary on today's judicial circus, it shows that things have not changed over the past fifty years - you have enough money, you can get away with murder.  And as a movie, it is just plain fun.

Rob Marshall has a vast background in musical theatre and it shows that he understands that form.  What he doesn't have is a background in film making but this does not show in this polished film.  He has gathered a high caliber cast and crew that all perform to perfection.

What many feel was the great find was Catherine Zeta Jones.  But once you see her pedigree (she was a dance champion in Wales), this was a breeze for her.  That is not saying her performance was not incredible, it was, but it was the part that she was waiting for and finally got!

Renee Zellweger had the greatest challenge, musical comedy was totally foreign to her but she comes through perfectly.  But a lot of this is due to Marshall.  Having Zeta Jones as the professional entertainer Velma Kelly, allowed Marshall choose a non dancer for the role of Roxie.  And as Roxie, Renee shines.  She captures that fine line between innocence and conniving murderess.

Richard Gere has a musical background but not a strong one.  Therefore, his performance is better than expected.  He actually took tap lessons and performs all his own dancing.  This was probably the most overlooked performance of the year (well except by the Golden Globes.)

DVD EXTRAS:

Deleted Musical Number ""Class"" by Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah with optional commentary by Marshall and writer Bill Condon - Watch the number first then rewatch with the commentary.  This will give you maximum  enjoyment of what is one of the great musical numbers that didn't make the film.

Behind the Scenes Special - This was a making of documentary that was made after the movie won its six Oscars.  This is very good featurette that has lots of insights into the making of the film.

Fabulous dance numbers, catchy songs, and a superb directing job by Rob Marshall. The audio commentary is also very good. I love the numbers, All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and Roxie.

1472839,4,B00005JLSE,"Chicago may not be the most deserving of Best Picture winners, but the plot is solid, the acting is fantastic, the choreography is great, and some of the songs are very entertaining (see Gere's tap dancing scene), while some of the others seem to go on forever.  One of the problems to the film is that it makes use of the ""musical"" too much.  There seems to be a new song every three minutes, while in a stage musical, the songs would be spread out further.  But, the film has such a feel-good emotion to it.  We empathize and care about the characters, even when they are doing everything in their powers to get fame and fortune.  Gere's character is ruthless, moving from one big thing to the next, while throwing each client out the door when they lose popularity.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good, also very ruthless, and we feel her pain of being yesterday's news.  Queen Latifah did not really impress me, and I don't think she quite had the edge for an Oscar nomination (in fact, I don't think Zeta-Jones should have won either; clearly the strongest supporting actress in the race was Meryl Streep in Adaptation).  I like the film, the music is good, Rob Marshall never really has impressed me as a director (which is why Polanski took home the Oscar), and I don't think that the film was good enough for a Best Picture win.  However, we all know that the Academy loves to feel nostalgic, and a musical revival is what they needed at that time.  The best picture of 2002, in my opinion, wasn't even nominated; I think Adaptation should have been at least nominated, but there were stronger films nominated for Best Picture in 2002 that could have taken the award home, and I think the strongest nominated film on the list was Gangs of New York (come on, give Scorcese one already), but I think Scorcese will join the ranks of Robert Altman, as amazing filmmakers who will only get an ""Honorary"" award.

1472846,4,B00005JLSE,"2002's Chicago was a box office smash and signaled the return of movie musicals, along with Moulin Rouge a year before, and The Phantom Of The Opera, Rent, and The Producers since. Winner of 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, its initial DVD treatment was not one worthy of a Best Picture Oscar-winner. Featuring a making-of featurette, an audio commentary, and a deleted musical number, Class, the DVD definitely needed work.

2005 saw the announcement of a deluxe 3-disc DVD of the movie, called The Razzle Dazzle Edition. However, sometime in the year, the release was pushed back from September to December, and the third disc, containing the soundtrack in 5.1 Digital Surround, was dropped. However, the 2-disc treatment still finally gives this movie a deserving, if not perfect, DVD treatment.

The transfer itself is good, but it's a bit grainy. For a new movie, which likely has pristine digital sources for video, the transfer shouldn't be as grainy as it is. The grain isn't heavy, but it's still slightly noticeable. Despite that, the transfer was very well done. Disc 1 also contains the Class number, which although is great, would not have worked within the film's concept of everything being through Roxie's point of view. Also, a feature on the plays, Broadway show, and its eventual translation to the big screen, and an audio commentary round out disc 1.

Disc 2 contains lots of amazing bonuses. Extended musical performances, featurettes on the crew, a feature on when Liza Minelli played Roxie Hart, a feature on the cameo appearance by Chita Rivera, Broadway's original Velma Kelly, and VH1's Behind The Movie are included on here. My only real beef is the VH1 special. It would have been nice for them to make a new, longer, more in-depth making-of documentary that also covered the Oscar wins, as the VH1 special was aired after the nominations were announced, but before the ceremony. Also, a theatrical trailer or two would have been nice. I will never understand why these are omitted from DVDs, as trailers are almost always readily available, and were once one of the few features, if not THE only feature on DVDs.

Despite a few gripes, I heartily recommend this DVD. If you own the previous DVD, sell it or give it to someone who doesn't care about bonus features and pick this new edition up. If you don't own it already, what are you waiting for?!",1138579200,7,2380,4.854679802955665
1472847,5,B00005JLSE,"In response to your review, i don't think that this movie is setting a bad example. Anyone with more than half a brain can see that there are consequences for committing crimes, even in this movie, and can tell the difference between right and wrong! Any husand or boyfriend who goes to see this with his wife or girlfriend just has to take it with good humor. It's only a movie!

Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere AND Rene Zelwegger are all good actors, no matter how much plastic surgury any of them have had, and deseve recognition for their performances. It's not easy getting up there and snging and dancing, especially if it's good!

This movie has morals and is trying to teach something, which you would know if you had been paying attention when you were watching it. It shows you what people will do for fame, yes, but it also shows you that those people don't end up happy. Even if at the end of the movie Roxie and Velma have a successful act, you know that they are never going to have a boyfriend for long and will either end up back in jail, or live a miserable life of 'jazz, liquer and drugs'.

It's simply choppy and downright DUMB. Either make a murder mystery or a jazz musical....putting both together just doesn't work, especially with a character nobody should have any sympathy for...an adulteress and killer who is completely brainless to boot.

1472921,2,B00005JLSE,"The story is a juicy one.

The plot centres around two scorned woman. The first is Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a famed vaudeville performer who kills her cheating husband and sister. The other is Roxy Hart (Renee Zellweger), a wannabe vaudeville star who kills her abusive lover. Both women battle it out in prison for the attentions of their lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the media. Being skillfully manipulated by Billy, Roxy becomes a media sensation and major celebrity to the dismay of her rival, Velma.

The musicals message is an unpleasant one. Especially when considering that both woman were killers and despite this, they are portrayed as victims and come out on top. Now I am by no means stating that I take offence to the content. It takes a lot more than the glorification of 2 beautiful murderers to offend me. As a matter of fact, since I was never a fan of the musical, the racy storyline was what convinced me to watch this. Juicy tales of murderous mayhem and scandalous, amoral women will be a huge draw for many.

With that said, I will never understand why this movie won so many Oscars. Was it Hollywood trying to revive the movie musical by making them popular again? Or is there truth in the claim that ""Chicago"" or Miramax bought the Oscars?

Who knows but this film was far from being the ""Best Picture"" of 2002. Especially when compared to the other nominees. As I have already mentioned, I was never a fan of the musical. I always found the music too bland and other than the show's most famous number, ""All That Jazz"", which is indeed great, there isn't another song in the score that catches the imagination. In my opinion, the melodies are forgettable. The film, despite it's glossy exterior was shallow in it's core.

The film starts off well, with Catherine Zeta-Jones doing a pretty good rendition of ""All That Jazz"". I will admit that Zeta-Jones has great stage presence and a good voice but was it Oscar worthy? I'm not so sure. However when compared to others in the cast, Catherine is indeed, sensational. Renee Zelwegger on the other hand, is a good actress but her voice is too thin and rather unimpressive. It's still far superior and much more pleasing to the ears than Richard Gere's voice which I found to be beyond annoying. Gere's instrument (if I can call it that) was grating and my ear drums suffered greatly. The only other actor in the piece that has some musical abilities is Queen Latifah. Admittedly, she is a charming performer with some real talent. Her solo number is also pretty entertaining but I ask again, was her performance Oscar worthy? I have yet to meet someone who, after seeing this film has firmly answered my question with a convincing yes. As much as I like Queen Latifah, she does nothing here that she hasn't already done in her music videos. Her performance was hardly ground-breaking. Her nomination, along with others in the cast, with the possible exception of Zeta-Jones, caused the elimination of other actors who were far more worthy of it. That's a shame.

Catherine Zeta-Jones's opening act and Latifah's charming number are definitely film highlights. Another scene that I have to admit is expertly done is the ""Cell Block Tango"". It features several black-clad women showing off their fine figures and dancing skills and the scene is enhanced by some great choreography and Zeta-Jones, who is again, fantastic here. The rest of the musical performances are not really worth mentioning. They're glitzy but mindless. All style with no substance. Lacking intricate choreography, emotion and skill. They substitute it with colour and flash.

Another problem I had was that this film cheated a little. It seems the makers of ""Chicago"" didn't have much faith in today's audience and the genre and instead of making this a straight-forward musical, they decided to justify the musical numbers by featuring them as being a figment of Roxy's imagination. The musical numbers are structured and played out like music videos and I think this was a cop-out. I would have much preferred a more traditional musical theatre experience.

Those who love this film, love it a lot but there are a countless others who feel that the much-hyped ""Chicago"" didn't deserve all of it's praise. Especially when considering that other film musicals were far greater in scope and unjustifiably hardly got half of the attention.

But at the end of the day, it's not Chicago's fault it's over-rated. Or is it?

So says Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a hot-shot Chicago attorney who makes his living by saving young girls who happen to have killed someone from getting the rope around their beautiful necks. And allow me to add ""this whole movie"" to that sentence I just quoted. In a non-derogatory manner, by the way, because ""Chicago"" is show business from beginning to end and that's its very soul.

In this case, if you are a woman and want to make the front page of the newspapers, the best way seems to be killing your husband, getting caught by the cops and getting Flynn to take over your case in court. That and $5,000. The rest is, as they say, history. And rightly so because you'll go down as quickly as you went up, as soon as the girl next door does the same thing you did. Because it's Chicago, and ""you can't beat fresh blood on the walls"", as Flynn tells Roxie (Rene Zellwegger), the new kid on the block as she finds out her fifteen minutes of fame have ran out.

My advice is that you don't go see ""Chicago"" looking for a whodunnit kind of thriller involving cabarets and stage dancers. Instead, if ""Moulin Rouge"" bringing the musical genre back to the spotlight pleased you, this one is also definitely for your liking. I'm no expert in this kind of movie (it's not even my cup of tea) and so I have a hard time figuring out whether what we have here is story interrupted by songs or songs interrupted by story.

That duality brings an interesting quality to the film, though. Whereas the songs are full of color and splendor in good Broadway tradition, the rest is shown in bleak tones, suiting 1930's Chicago. The story however is never to be taken seriously, but always lightly. It makes sense but it is also goofy in a way.

The acting is all great and it's no wonder because a) they're all accomplished actors and b) most have stage formation and experience. Zeta-Jones is especially hot and on the spot as Velma Kelly, as her past as a professional dancer in London really shows. I just don't know if this performance is Oscar worthy but then again that's a tricky business. Scorsese must be thinking the same thing after his ""Gangs of New York"" was put out to dry...",1128902400,5,2241,4.482843137254902

1472999,5,B00005JLSE,"This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.

The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.

Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.

In the jail, Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.

The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.

The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, ""When You're Good To Mama"" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.

The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, ""Mister Cellophane"", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his ""Razzle Dazzle"" number and his tap dancing.

I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for ""Best Picture"". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud.

Catherine Zeta Jones and Michelle Zellweger are on target in every way. The sets and the story that a bad deed can catapult you to fame are originally done.

Some of the costumes were quite bondage-looking, and the dance numbers were quite sexual and provocative. The director misses no opportunities to flash a bit of skin and I'm reminded a bit of the 'women in prison' sexploitation films from the seventies. =-/ Bleh.

Still, this is a light-hearted glossy film with some great dance numbers and a few catchy tunes. Well worth the time and expense, even if I found the style a trifle exploitive and the plot glossing over such serious subjects as prison, murder, and spousal abuse a trifle disturbing.",1124064000,,906,4.84516129032258
1473003,5,B00005JLSE,"Wow kids, thanks for the trivia but what does that have to do with how wonderful the movie is!?

""Chicago"" is a very well written musical by Fred Ebb, John Kander and Bob Fosse that is still playing on Broadway today in its revival incarnation. In 2002, Mirimax released the wonderful motion picture adaptation. Catherine Zeta-Jones sings and dances Velma Kelly just as well as previous Velma, Chita Rivera and ever better than Bebe Newirth. Richard Gere, although nasil, does a wonderful job as Billy Flynn. Renne Zellwegger plays Roxie nicely, like a Kewpie doll, only problem: if she'd open those eyes!

John C. Reily is great at Amos. I wish he were given more to do. But the real scene stealer is Queen Latifah as Marton Morton. She is a true musical performer who has great comic timing.

Rob Marshall's direction and choreography is excellent. The editing is even better. Bill Condon's screenplay is brilliant. The two men have put together a brilliant spin on the great show.

""Chicago"", like previous reviewers have said, won 6 Oscars including Best Picture. A film this good and this sucessful (most finanically sucessful of all Mirimax films) deserved a two disc set. When it was released on DVD in 2003, I for one was shocked. It got a single page chapter guide and one flimsy disc with the movie, the cut song ""Class"", an audio commentary and a commerical of a ""Behind-the-Scenes"" look.

Now, we finally get a THREE disc ""Chicago"" set. Hopefully it will include some info on the wonderful, if ignored, Bob Fosse directed 1975 production and some information on some of the breifly mentioned in the commentary ideas for the cut songs ""Me and My Baby"" and ""My Own Best Friend.""

1473096,5,B00005JLSE,"Winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Chicago is a brilliant big screen adaptation of choreographer-director Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical. The story's ingenious jabs at tabloid fame and the fleeting tastes of the popular mindset, omnipresent in the 1920's (the movie's setting) and the 1970's (the date of its writing) is just as relevant today in an age where O.J. Simpson, the Menedez Brothers, and Scott Peterson dominate the pop culture airwaves. Set in Capone's backyard in the midst of the Roaring 20's, Chicago turns in an all-star Hollywood cast and breathes much needed life (i.e. box office success) back into the big screen musical. Viewers won't be disappointed.

Chicago stars Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Roxie, wife of sweet, boring Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), has an affair with furniture salesman Fred Casely (Dominic West) who she thinks knows the right people to get her a gig as a singer at a swanky nightclub. But when Roxie finds out that Fred is just using her, she shoots him dead right there in her bedroom. When Amos arrives, he sticks up for Roxie, telling the police that he shot the intruder. At least, until he finds out that the dead man is Fred Casley, the man who recently sold them their furniture. Retracting his story, the police arrest Roxie for Fred Casely's murder.

Meanwhile, sexy songstress and half of a famous Chicago nightclub sister act, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), sits in jail herself awaiting the day of her trial for the murder of her husband and sister (who she caught performing their number ""the spread eagle""). Roxie asks Velma for help, but gets the cold shoulder. But at least one person in the prison is willing to help Roxie. Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah), overseer of the woman's prison, will do anything for anyone for the right price. For fifty bucks, she places a phone call to the greatest defense lawyer in modern-day times, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). But a phone call only gets her in the door. Roxie's husband Amos must come up with the money to pay Billy, which he does prior to being quickly forgotten.

Manipulating the media to the best of his ability, Billy turns Roxie into an overnight celebrity - the hottest sensation to sweep Chicago since, well - since the next one that will come along... Velma Kelly fades from the headlines, and the two rivals compete with each other for the public's and Billy Flynn's attention.

Chicago is a refreshing escape the drudgery of modern day box office blockbusters with its insightful peering into the mob mentality of the public psyche and its colorful characters. Queen Latifah steals the show with her portrayal of Mama Morton in a film packed with knockout performances by Hollywood mainstays. All of the stars sing their own numbers, and the soundtrack is simply spectacular. Broadway purists may be critical of the final product, but no one can doubt that Chicago is as big a hit on screen as it is on stage. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this one...

I thought the actual story was very good, but the music was terrible! I don't even remember much of the story because when they would flip over to a musical scene I would lose interest and start daydreaming about all the other places I'd rather be. If they had cut the music I might've gave this movie 3 stars. And as for Renee Zelwegger and Katherine Zeta-Jones dancing together, (or at least they tried to pass it off as dancing) what was that (...)? They were barely even in synch with each other.

1473098,4,B00005JLSE,"'Chicago' is the movie of a musical style in jazz, so it attracted me for that reason at first time. After I enjoyed the movie, I realized it contains the serious plot and theme. 'Chicago' shows that the society overflows with crime nowadays. In this movie, two female jazz singer want to acquire fame even by murdering someone. They take advantage of being prisoners, and pretend to be pitiful making up a party with their lawyer who wants only money. Finally, they win reputation on their own stage.

  The movie contains many of splendor scenes. Because the musical 'Chicago' is adapted for the screen successfully, it makes me very exciting and dynamic. The excellent background music and the jazz tune flows on the screen attractively.

  Although the music and scene look beautiful, the conclusion of this movie teaches us something immoral. The plot that two offenders get fame has an bad influence on the audience because the movie beautifies the crime in fact.

  I recommend this movie to the person who loves the music, especially jazz, because of the excellent music and performance in this movie like seeing an excellent musical.",1110672000,,1142,4.93717277486911
1473167,4,B00005JLSE,"I have never been a big fan of musicals, and there is only a couple that I consider great movies, like ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cabaret"". I have to say that even though ""Chicago"" is not at the exact same level as these two movies, it is good enough to leave a lasting impression. The music is very good and entertaining, the performances of Catherine Zetta-Jones and Renee Zellweger are inspiring, and the story is interesting.

The film starts by jumping right into the action, with amazing music - what a great song is ""All that Jazz"" - and with Velma Kelly (Zetta-Jones) walking into her dressing room, hiding a gun and washing the blood from her hands. That same night, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is among the audience watching Velma and dreaming of being like her. She even witnesses when the police comes to take Velma away for the murder of her cheating husband and her sister, who was the object of his affection.

Meanwhile, Roxie is acting on her dreams, and to get there she is sleeping with a man she believes has connections in the show business world and can help her become a star. When she finds out that he was lying, and his ""connections"" were just a scam to get into her pants, she kills him by shooting him point blank. The husband tries to save her, but is not successful in his attempt, and does not try hard after he figures out what was going on between the deceased and his wife; thus, Roxie ends up in the same prison as Velma.

Enters Billy Flynn (Gere), the slick lawyer that has a reputation for being able to get anyone off the hook, no matter how gruesome the crime or how abundant the evidence. He is Roxie's last chance, so she has to engage in a competition with Velma to see which case he handles first. The corrupt environment also includes Mama (Queen Latifah), the prison guard who really believes in tit for tat and is always on the prowl for fresh meat.

I was surprised when I learned that both Zellweger and Zetta-Jones actually sing themselves in all the music pieces, since the quality of their singing is superb and it appears to be done by professional singers. Both of them do an outstanding job in their acting, and are supported in their roles by the quality performances of Richard Gere and Queen Latifah. Congratulations to Rob Marshall and his team for a remarkable final product.",1110153600,,2324,4.513064133016627
1473168,4,B00005JLSE,"This is a musical in the tradition of musicals that are entertaining and easy to digest, and yet some hours later leave one with some apprehension.  Is it really the intent of the story to celebrate getting away with murder?  Or is this movie a statement about how murder by women in emotionally trying circumstances can be justified?  Or perhaps is this an indictment of the criminal justice system?  Or is this just a spicy entertainment?

I'll opt for the latter; however I can tell you that women will find this more agreeable than their spouses.  There is a kind of historically revisionist feeling to the sentiments expressed.  I seriously doubt that this production, in which murder from jealousy is seemingly justified, would have been produced as a musical comedy before the modern era.

But never mind.  What makes Bob Fosse's Chicago a hit (and the Academy's Best Picture of 2002) are the beautifully staged and choreographed song and dance numbers, the spiffy direction and neat editing, a lot of leggy flesh along with some fine performances by Queen Latifah, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.

In particular I liked Queen Latifah's performance.  When she comes on singing ""When You're Good to Momma"" she just about brings the house down.  I also liked her portrayal of the savvy and corrupt Boss Lady on Murderess Row.  Zeta-Jones got the Oscar for best Supporting Actress, and she was good, but I think Latifah, who was also nominated, was just as impressive if not more so.

Zellweger, looking almost anorectic compared to the last time I saw her in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)--released only the year before--gives a solid performance in a very demanding role, although to be honest, it appeared that she was doing a lot of lipsyncing.  Still one is amazed at how good she and Zeta-Jones were at the old song and dance, not having been previous known for being twinkle-toed.

You might want to see this to compare how it stands up to a long line of filmland musicals, such as Oklahoma, South Pacific, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Phantom of the Opera, etc.  Chicago certainly is well within the confines of that venerable traditional, although it is my feeling, that despite the Academy's favor, this is just a notch below the best.",1109376000,3,2257,4.866492146596858

The plot of the movie is that two ladies are on murderess row and Gere is trying to make them stars from there.  Yet, there is only one room for a legend.  In the end there will be a star, who will it be?  It is a great remake of a musical and I enjoyed the music.  I think the music shinned right along with the movie!",1108080000,,578,3.871794871794872

Gere and Zeta-Jones and Zelleweger couldn't sing or dance to save their lives, but thanks to modern technology we can edit a movie so much to make this bombastic mess, which helps them appear to know how to perform in a play-sorry, no thanks.  The fact that this picture somehow stole the Best Picture from Lord of the Rings (a true masterpiece) is beyond me and makes the Oscars a joke in my opinion.

An adaption of a the Broadway musical, director Rob Marshall blends together the straightforward adaptions of old, with the surreal, in-your-face production of Moulin Rouge!  The result is amazing.  The ""dream sequence"" technique allows the narrative to take place in real life yet still allow for exciting music numbers.

The performances are similarly wonderful.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah, and even Richard Gere all sing and dance wonderfully.  It's great to see actors who don't normally sing and dance be pushed to the edge of their talents.  While there could have been a few improvements, it was overall a great production.  Add that with Bill Fosse's old wonderful coreography and some excellent and creative set design, and Chicago makes a great movie.

But a not so great DVD.  While Marshall and writer Bill Condon have a great commentary, and the deleted song Class is interesting, I wish there could have been more.  Moulin Rouge got a great DVD treatment - I'm upset this didn't either.  Still, Chicago is a wonderful movie that every musical lover should own.",1102377600,3,1142,5.113513513513514
1473174,5,B00005JLSE,"Some movies have all the luck and time their arrivals perfectly.  Fortunately for movie-lovers, two recent musicals have hit the jackpot.  2001's ""Moulin Rouge"" was a hit (more so on DVD than in the theater) because Americans were hungering for musicals and didn't even know it.  2002's ""Chicago"" good timing may not have been as much of a surprise, but its combination of great music, good dance numbers, racy songs, and ultimately its cynical take on America's infatuation with fame are just plain irresistible.

An interpretation of Bob Fosse's 1975 theater production (Fosse was from Chicago and was in love with the seedy underworld that dominated the city's headlines), ""Chicago"" revolves around Roxie Hart's impassioned murder of her lover - a word to the wise, if you've seduced an ambitious starlet with tall tales of your ability to get her into a big show, you should break the bad news to her in a letter, not in her bedroom after a tryst.  Tempers run hot with theatrical types, you know.

Renee Zellweger plays the nave Mrs. Hart, and her performance is a lot of fun for fans of her other work.  Zellweger usually plays characters who are smarter than everyone around them assumes.  In ""Chicago,"" Zellweger allows her ambition to trump her I.Q., and it's not much of a contest - but it's a blast to watch this talented actress dial up the clueless factor.

Zellweger's dancing and singing are also a pleasant surprise - after ""Moulin Rouge,"" we're getting used to being surprised at how good some actors can be with the hoofing and the singing.

Hart is married to a loveable shlub of a mechanic, Amos, played by John C. Reilly, who is even more nave than his wife.  He refuses to take the fall for Roxie after realizing that the deceased was their furniture salesman, and he gave them a 10% discount out of the blue.  But Amos, ""Mr. Cellophane,"" allows himself to be led by the nose for most of the movie, and Reilly's performance is pitch-perfect.  And what pipes!

Locked away on Death Row (Roxie asks of these special accommodations in the prison, ""Is it nicer?""), Roxie first turns to prison warden Big Mama (Queen Latifah).  In a musical number for the ages, ""When You're Good to Mama,"" Latifah almost steals the entire show.  This song is a masterpiece of double-entendre and attitude, and Latifah nails it perfectly.

Mama turns Roxie on to ""the best criminal lawyer in Illinois,"" Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), a fast-talking flim-flam artist with a law degree who will represent Roxie for the princely sum of $5,000.  Despite his professed modesty, Flynn believes that he could have changed world history if Jesus had only had $5,000 and lived in Chicago rather than Galilee.

Gere has the attitude, the looks, and the charm to play Flynn, although it must be said that his singing and dancing numbers don't quite seem up to par - but in a way this works because it reminds us that Gere is first and foremost and actor, not a Broadway hoofer, and it is refreshing to see Gere taking such a bold stab at such a challenging role.  By virtually ignoring the law and playing to the crowd with the ""old razzle-dazzle,"" Flynn attempts to get Roxie off.

Unfortunately for Roxie, her murder trial bumps another murder trial off the front page - the murder of Veronica Kelly by her sister, Velma (played with cynical gusto by Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose stage background is readily apparent).  Can anyone play a rhymes-with-witch like this lady?  Kelly learns the hard way about the pain of falling from the top of the pedestal, and just how big the gap is between headlining and page sixteen.  But she is not one to sit back, and her scheming also offers a threat to young Roxie's chances for getting off.

A pell-mell musical with style and wit to spare, ""Chicago"" does not offer many surprises as far as plot or character development go - everyone stays basically true to their nature - but the pleasures of watching this amazing cast perform this raunchy musical are exquisite.",1102377600,4,4004,4.734870317002882

1473267,5,B00005JLSE,"I must toast director Rob Marshall with a tall glass of champagne (I don't even drink, so this should speak volumes to you why I would break my rule!).  He definitely brought a seamlessly successful broadway musical to the ""big screen"" with smooth grace.  Though, this process was anything but easy, according to the TV show I distinctively recall on Broadway that divulged all kinds of juicy tidbits about production (particularly the great ""blood, sweat and tears"" efforts Richard Gere took in fine tuning his tap dance routine--Gere was previously not known for his dance, partly because he hadn't really formally had to put into practice in a film before.  He went on to showcase his flair for movement in the American remake of SHALL WE DANCE, with Jennifer Lopez.)  Catherine Zeta-Jones had musical theater in her blood, and came by her singing and dancing with ease and grace (and never looked lovelier accepting that well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, as Velma Hart in this film, right before she was scheduled to give birth to her baby!).  Renee Zellwegger had minimal ""formal"" training in dancing, but made improvements in leaps and bounds (no pun intended), which is made evident in the numbers where she appears as a soloist, as well as her duets with Catherine Zeta-Jones.

I know I haven't spent much time discussing the plot, but, in all honesty, it is pretty convoluted and I would only ruin the experience of watching the film for you!  I will say that is set during the age of the ""Roaring Twenties,"" and oh boy, did they (rightfully) have something to howl about, back then.  The intrigues associated with fleeting celebrity are examined closely and at their most visceral.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) is the ""up and coming"" singer/dancer who just can't get that big break, and is never really what anyone is looking for. While Velma Hart (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the sultry star with the fashionable bob that no one can get enough of.  It isn't until a swift turn of fate (well, that and the sound of a gun going off!) that brings these two women together....in a prison, of all things....Okay, that is where I will stop.  No more plot details required, believe me.  What I will add on to this review, before I close, is just how wonderful the score is by Ebb & Kander.  Songs like ""All That Jazz"" are featured here.  You know, those great toe-tapping hits that you frequently associate with some of the greatest works of the late choreographer Bob Fosse (who orchestrated some really hot numbers for the original Broadway production, with his wife Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart, along with Chita Rivera, who played a fiery Velma).  There is a reason that CHICAGO received an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2002.  You'll love this film, in all of its saucy and enchanting glory.",1098921600,,2834,4.800411522633745

It's brash, but that is precisely its motivation.  It's loud, garish and contrived.  It has to be - - not only because it's scripted but in order to untrivialize its theme while showing how it has been trivialized.  That Renee Zellweger as murderess Roxie Hart is made to look like Madeline Kahn made to look like Marilynn Monroe is telling enough.  There are a lot of great scenes, my personal fave being the climactic courtroom scene late into the film wherein Richard Gere's character verbally tapdances his way to his client's acquital; the interspliced tapdancing bits of Gere himself are both hilarious and perfectly spot-on.  (Rob Marshall is a choreographic genius.)  I won't give away the ending, but the origin of the putative journal which decides Roxie's fate is both obvious in hindsight and perfectly scandalous.

Also, one can't fault a movie with a cast like this one.  However, after finally seeing it, I am disappointed.  Several reasons:  the show has no real showstopping, hummable songs---even ALL THAT JAZZ doesn't carry the movie like DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE, OH WHAT  BEAUTIFUL MORNING and HELLO DOLLY.  The deleted ""Class"" is an awful, foul-mouthed attempt at humor, but it certainly showcased the vocal abilities of Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah.  Also, the leading ladies were murderesses:  how could one want either of them to be successful?  Latifah, though Oscar nominated, is playing the same shtick she does in any of her movies, and in my opinion, didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.  The revelations, of course, were Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly's vocal deliveries.  Gere truly took a chance as a singing, dancing Billy Flynn, but he is marvelous and he DID deserve an Oscar nod.  Reilly too is revealing in his CELLOPHANE MAN number; he has a richly nuanced voice and it's one of the best numbers in the film.  Zeta-Jones also had much more pizzazz and energy than Zellwegger.  I've read where the transfer to film brought Roxie's character to the front, and minimized Velma's.  Who knows how great it would have been if Velma and Zeta-Jones had more screen time.  I do think Catherine deserved her Oscar, though.  This beautiful actress is talented and has shown diversity in her many roles.  Zellwegger always seems to be playing the same Nurse Betty and Cold Mountain characters in all of her films.

Still, I relented.  To me, a good movie would be that it's still watchable and enjoyable years after it's released.  The decision was a good one.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was simply spectacular in her role as Velma.  Her background in musical showed through.  Her experience and her confidence oozed through & thus, her personality suited Velma to the dots and tees.  Renee was also brilliant in her role as Roxie but one couldn't help noticing her cautiousness in doing the numbers.  However, her presence was so relevant to the twenties.  Richard Gere, Reilly, Queen Latifah were all excellent in their roles.  What made their performances even more admirable was that all of them sang and danced through ""Chicago"" and they were all amateurs before this.  The additional features let us have a better appreciation of the casts in their roles by tireless and countless rehearsals.  Whilst the razzle dazzle was impressive, the movie had a serious undertone, the analysis of the change of America's society.

I think that most movies fail to bring the transition of Broadway to the movie screen.

I love the classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""West Side Story."" I hope they *don't* remake those! I was also disappointed by the Moulin Rouge, it just didn't do it for me. Chicago is just another disappointment. The classic musicals are much more superior to today's. They just don't make them like they used to.

I've never seen Chicago on Broadway, so maybe the theatre version is much better than the movie. I found this to be true when it came to Les Miserables. I loved the Broadway play and eventually saw Les Miserables on dvd with Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes. I really liked the movie but the Broadway play is much better.

Some of the original music was deleted (why?).

1473349,5,B00005JLSE,"Who would have thought an age where movie musicals are all but non-existant would produce one of the most entertaining film musicals of all time?  Although stylistically very different from such acknowledged greats as Singing in the Rain, West Side Story, and My Fair Lady, Chicago easily earns a place among those aforementioned classics.  The film takes the dark source material (made even more so by Bob Fosse's original direction) and transfers it to screen in all its delightful decadence, assaulting the senses and challenging the modern preception of what a musical should be.  The world of musical theatre has changed quite a bit since the 1960s heyday of movie musicals, and Chicago offers a glimpse into the more mature world of today's musicals.

The story centers around Roxie Hart, who kills her lover and then attempts to parlay the publicity into a career in showbiz.  Along the way she runs across the similar-minded Velma Kelly, and both of them end up vying for the attention of hotshot lawyer Billy Flinn.  If the story sounds a bit darker than the sugar-coated musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein, it is, yet there is a sense of fun about the entire event that is infectious.  The movie's plot unfolds through some fast-paced and wonderfully acted dialogue scenes, along the way touching upon America's obsession with fame.

Of course, the movie's bread and butter are the musical numbers, and Rob Marshall has come up with the brilliant idea of most of the songs being imagined by Roxie and therefore taking place only in her head.  This works especially well for the material, in which most of the numbers comment upon the action rather than reveal plot.  However, Marshall intercuts the songs with plot-advancing tibits, and although some seem turned off by this cut-cut-cut editing choice, I think it gives the movie a kinetic energy that helps speed things along.

The numbers themselves are lavishly and inventively staged, and each song manages to differentiate itself from the rest.  Marshall never repeats himself, and the result is a movie which keeps the audience guessing.  Standouts include the famous opening number ""All That Jazz"" and ""The Cell Block Tango,"" which sport simply jaw-dropping choreography and a showmanship that most movie musicals strive for but never achieve.

And then there's the talent.  All of the actors do their own singing and dancing, and I personally had no idea some of these actors were so talented.  Renee Zellweger's Roxie Hart is at once vulnerable yet tenacious, and she handles her songs well.  She especially scores with ""Roxie,"" and to a lesser extent with ""Nowadays.""  Richard Gere's absolutely charming as self-centered lawyer Billy Flinn, with his tap dance towards the end of the film being his defining moment.

But the real finds are Queen Latifa and especially Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Each of them does some stellar work with their dialogue scenes, displaying sharp comic timing and the sort of nuancing only the most accomplished performers achieve.  Both ladies belt out their numbers with confidence, with Latifa using her music background to score a homerun with the showstopping ""When Your Good to Mama.""  Meanwhile, Catherine Zeta-Jones sings, dances, and acts her way to a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Velma Kelly, stealing just about every scene she's in.  Her take on ""All That Jazz"" is nearly worth the price of admission alone.  And as a bonus, the DVD release includes the cut duet for Jones and Latifa entitled ""Class,"" which is one of the funnier numbers in the score.

Chicago is one for the ages, combining a decidely adult and yes, slightly cynical slant with glorious production numbers and brilliant acting.  Anyone with an open mind will enjoy this movie, and as a musical theatre nut I thank God for Rob Marshall's work on this film.  Hopefully, it will pave the way for a second golden age of movie musicals.",1092268800,4,3940,5.0030674846625764

1473351,3,B00005JLSE,"I'm afraid I have to dissent somewhat from the gushing reviews preceding this.

Certainly, there's plenty to admire in Chicago. The song-and-dance numbers are staged with verve and imagination. You get Kander and Ebb's good, though not great, score. (The sound recording has marvelous presence, especially if you have the equipment to play back the DTS version.)

You get one and a half superlative performances in the lead roles. Who ever would have thought Catherine Zeta-Jones had it in her to be a mesmerizing singer and dancer? A very pleasing revelation.

Renee Zellweger continually brings up a conflict for me: she's adorable, obviously talented ... and seems to need very little encouragement to over-torque every expression and gesture. I'm sure Rob Marshall encouraged her to play broadly, in keeping with his own directorial style, and the net effect is just too much of a caricature. But she, too, is a knockout in the musical and terpsichorean department. The big climactic scene when Zeta-Jones and Zellweger perform a duet is the most electrifying thing of its kind I've ever seen.

So why don't I give Chicago a rave?

First, there is the preening, simpering embarrasment that is Richard Gere, who has ruined more movies than I care to remember. He can't ruin this one, but it's a close call. Again, I'm sure the director didn't ask him for subtlety, but even farce takes some discipline. (Some would say it takes more discipline than any other form of acting.) Gere is such a clumsy actor that he's painful to watch. Maybe the ladies (or guys, if so inclined) who think he's dishy won't care.

But the overall problem, for me, is a matter of tone. It's set in the '20s, but nothing about it (especially the dialogue) authentically evokes the time, or, I suspect, the place.

Worse, the film is so relentlessly cynical and mean-spirited that, even when it's impressive, you can't shake off the feeling that the drink has been spiked with something poisonous. Chicago just keeps punching you out, showing you what a sucker you are for caring for any of these people, or for anyone in the world.

Musicals don't have to be lollipops, and some of the best have darker shadings. Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! mixes serious emotions with its flamboyant music and choreographic artistry, for instance. Chicago, for all its energy and compelling vitality, is monomaniacal  -- a steely, misanthropic supershow.",1091059200,2,2425,4.982673267326732
1473352,4,B00005JLSE,"The 2002 Oscar winner for Best Picture,""Chicago"" is a musical which has the late Bob Fosse's choreography stamped all over it, although it's really anybody's guess as to whether or not he would have been pleased with this film version of his 1975 stage hit. Happily, the acting was great and the leads did their own singing and dancing.
 The story is based on the real-life cases of Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner, renamed respectively as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly (There was a real Roxie Hart as well, who committed murder in Indiana in the 1910s), who were exhonerated of murder charges by a flashy lawyer in the 1920s.
  The story begins on a snowy night at the Onyx Club in the Chicago of Al Capone, where the booze flows heavily despite Prohibition laws, and a brassy Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives at work late, stopping to hide the gun she has just used to kill her husband and sister after catching them in bed together. She performs the rousing number, ""All That Jazz"" shortly thereafter as if nothing has happened.
 Watching her is ex-chorine Roxie, played by a slender, shiny-complexioned and pixie-faced Renee Zellweger, whose unquenchable desire for fame has led her to cheat on her mechanic husband  with a slickster furniture salesman (Dominic West)who falsely claims he has connections that can revamp Roxie's career.
 Soon, Roxie and Fred Casley scurry over to the Hart's apartment to continue their affair. When Roxie asks Fred, as she has before, when he will introduce her to the club manager, and help her return to showbusiness, Fred admits that he lied. The following confrontation becomes violent and Roxie fatally shoots Fred as he tries to leave.
 Amos Hart, Roxie's dim-witted but devoted husband(John C. Reilly) tries to cover for her at first as Taye Diggs' Bandleader/Announcer leads us further into the action by introducing Roxie's first number, ""That Funny Honey"", which changes tones as the investigator mentions the victim's name and Amos becomes aware of his wife's infidelity.
 Roxie is arrested and taken to the Cook County Jail, where Chita Rivera, who originated the role of Velma Kelly on Broadway,has a cameo appearance as inmate Nickie.
 We are then introduced to Matron Mama Morton(a pretty, regal, and matronly Queen Latifah), and the vaudville numbers continue as she sings the racy and more-than-highly suggestive ""When You're Good to Mama"".
 As she begins her time in prison, we get to know Roxie's inmates during ""The Cell Block Tango"". Judging from the visuals, where most of the inmates' handkerchiefs came out red  as they finished giving details of their crimes and the Hungarian immigrant's was white, we are to believe that Katalin Helinszki (Ekaterina Chtchelkanova), who was accused of the most heinous of the murders, is innocent.
 Soon after, Mama Morton pulls a few strings, Defense Attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere, whose early training in stage musicals, like that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' serves him well here) arrives to represent Roxie, who also has push-over journalist/sob-sister, Mary Sunshine(Christine Baranski)in her corner.
 The song ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" is based on headlines from the actual case, and has the feel of a hymn sung at a revival meeting. It is reflective of Roxie's false repentance for her misdeeds.
 As the publicity  surrounding Roxie grows, and the opportunistic Flynn begins to devote more time to her than to his previous client, Velma, another potentially lucrative case appears for Billy  when Lucy Liu's pineapple heiress, Kitty Baxter committs a triple homicide(Note that his discussion of this case with dinner guests would not have taken place today), forcing Roxie and Velma to use a few tricks to win back Billy's attention, including a fake pregnancy.
  Onstage, as the murder-as-entertainment scenario continues, we are treated to the long-suffering but loyal Amos' ""Mr. Cellophane"", and his devotion to his unfaithful and ungrateful wife is heart-rending. But at least he gets more attention than the offscreen family of Fred Casley, who might have given the story an interesting perspective if included.
 Roxie's falling-out with Billy over his selected courtroom attire for her ends abruptly upon her observation of the tragic results of a poor woman's inability to get proper representation. Noteworthy is the strong anti-immigrant sentiment of the time.
 Ultimately, Flynn, Velma, and Roxie, razzle-dazzle 'em in court. Lies win out over truth, and style, in the form of Flynn, Velma and Roxie,  wins over substance in the form of Colm Feore's prosecutor, Martin Harrison, Katalin Helinszki, and Amos, and the Hart's neighbor, Mrs. Borusewiz (Jayne Eastwood), who also took the witness stand, as often happens in life.
 Although acquitted, things didn't end so happily for the real Beulah Annan, whose life ended in a sanitarium in 1928. Belva Gaertner lived to see her story told onstage the year before.
 But the man-manipulating Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly live to dazzle the world again, and our rollicking tale of cynical truth ends on a positive note for our main players.

It appears to have been lifted quite faithfully from stage, which is unusual for a movie musical, and I would imagine the live show would be something to see!
The performances are top-notch, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lucy Liu (honest!) really stealing the show.  But there's not a bad performance in this film; even a supporting actor like Taye Diggs does a great job with the 30 seconds and handful of lines he has.
The downside of this movie is that it is not a ""book"" musical, to quote the director & writer from the commentary track.  In a book musical, the songs advance the story.  Instead, this is a musical in which the songs comment on the story as it advances, in an attempt to analogize the lives of our main characters with a vaudeville show (again, from the commentary track).  The downside is that this approach causes the movie to really drag in parts, especially toward the beginning.  This becomes a problem because there is so much singing in this movie.  If the songs aren't advancing the story, the story just grinds to a halt for 3-6 minutes until another dollop of narrative is ladled out.  Another peeve of mine was the tap dance number by Gere, performed in counterpoint to his questioning of a witness.  It's a bit too obvious and belabored.  However, I cannot fault the songs or the dance choreography at all.
As far as the DVD goes, the extras are somewhat limited: you get a commentary track, a deleted song, and a ""making of"" featurette, and that's it.  On the plus side, there is a DTS audio track if you like that sort of thing, and the video and sound are top-notch.

Secondly, the acting of course, by each of the actors featured in the movie, is superb. Thirdly, the set production and the costumes were dazzling and so well-coordinated. The director evidently put in a lot of hard work into this and it pays. This is no Moulin Rouge. In this film, the director has done to me what I think Baz Luhrmann couldn't do in Moulin Rouge - which is to successfully blend aspects of film with aspects of musicals seamlessly. The acting is dramatic but each actor fits the role so perfectly that you hardly suspect they're acting... you'd think they are really like that in person! And the music is so well-composed and played, that anyone who watches this will want to dance to it.

Such a musical wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of being produced today, if ever. Everything associated with such a production would be subjected to massive boycotts and PR campaigns by womens' groups, and would be stopped dead in its tracks. In fact, pre-censorship would prevail and the project would never seriously be considered.
Coincidentally, I borrowed this DVD from my local library while I was reading the chapter in Warren Farrell's terrific book, ""The Myth of Male Power - Why Men are the Disposable Sex"" that discusses how women receive much more lenient sentences for committing the same crimes as men.
The media is literally saturated with anti-male propaganda that women would never tolerate. This film is just one example.

1473541,5,B00005JLSE,"Not since ALL THAT JAZZ (1979) have I seen a film musical with as much raw energy as CHICAGO. This is fitting since the former is about the life of the brilliant director-choreographer-composer Bob Fosse, and the latter is an adaptation from his stage musical of the same name. As a matter of fact, the opening number in CHICAGO is ""All That Jazz"".
CHICAGO has, of course, enough of a rudimentary plot to cement together the dance numbers, which are the film's raison d'tre. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a wannabe dancer in 1930s Chicago, who idolizes Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). However, both are arrested for murder, Roxie having gunned down a duplicitous lover after he reneges on a promise to introduce her to a friend who can get her into the Biz, and Velma for having whacked her husband and her sister when she caught the two in bed together. Thrown into Cook County Jail, both fall under the control of the jolly and corrupt Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah), and both retain the services of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a flamboyant lawyer who specializes in defending women accused of homicide, and who's never lost a case.
There aren't enough superlatives to describe CHICAGO, and I fear my review won't do it justice. Jones, a former dancer before she turned actress, struts her magnificent stuff beginning with the opening number (""All That Jazz""). Zellweger and Gere, neither hoofers by training, are seemingly miscast - but it works magnificently. All three sing and dance their way through the film in visually stunning choreographed numbers that had the audience clapping after each.
As Roxie and Velma worked their way through the criminal and judicial systems, the creators of CHICAGO were astoundingly clever in superimposing a musical version of each step in the process on the ""real"" one, for examples, the on-site police investigation of Roxie's crime (""Funny Honey""), Matron Morton's introductory speech to her new charges (""When You're Good to Mama""), Flynn's entrance (""All I Care About""), and Roxie's defense (""We Both Reached for the Gun""). My favorite comes during Roxie's trial when Flynn, more showman than counselor, displays his philosophy on defense strategy with the glitzy ""Razzle Dazzle"".
CHICAGO is loud, colorful, in-your-face, exuberant entertainment. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. And if you don't take the opportunity to see it while it's on the Big Screen at the beginning of 2003, then you're doing yourself a huge injustice. I beg you to see this film! I intend to see it at least once more, and will purchase the CD soundtrack and DVD when they're released. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",1081728000,3,2694,4.962389380530974

1473653,5,B00005JLSE,"Here's a movie that is sure to really take your breath away, whether you like musicals or not.  Every so often Hollywood comes out with an ambitious production that is pulled off beautifully by director, cast & crew.  This is one such example of this!
The film stars Renee Zelwegger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as two women awaiting trial for murder during the Roaring 20s.  Zelwegger plays Roxie, a somewhat neurotic young woman who dreams of being the ""center of attention"" on a broadway stage.  Jones plays Velma, a woman who has already experienced such fame.
Roxie looks upon everything that happens in her life thru the lens of Vaudeville.  [It's because of this that the film turns out to be a musical].  By the time she gets to prison, Velma is the ""celebrity prisoner"" who gets all the publicity.
Richard Gere plays a fast-talking, suave lawyer who is hoping to get both of the girls off the hook (for a price).  His goal is to manipulate the media, public opinion and the jury in the girl's cases.
In the process, Roxie ends up supplanting Velma as the #1 prisoner celebrity.  Ironically, Roxie gets all the attention that she craved all her life, only it's from being a murderess instead of being a star.
Lucy Liu has a cameo as a heiress who threatens to usurp the celebrity status from both of them and grab the spotlight for herself.  All 3 women are cute in their 1920s short hairstyles, tho I must say I'm glad those hairstyles are no longer around!
One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that all the actors did their own singing and dancing.  There were no body doubles, stand-ins or lip-sinking.  Zelwegger said afterward that this was the most physically demanding movie she'd ever done, and it shows.
As a sidenote, it's interesting to note that the film is based on a play that was published in 1930.  The play was written by a journalist of the time and was a satire on women getting off of murder raps.  The film details how the courtroom itself can be turned into a stage for choereographed theatrics as opposed as a venue for finding the facts of a case.
While the duet between Jones & Zelwegger is in itself worth the price of this DVD, there is so much more.  This one is a can't-miss film.  It is feel-good in the sense that a talented group of people went out and tried to pull off a near-impossible project.....and they nailed it!",1079481600,5,2370,4.530516431924883

What I saw was just a collection of cardboard, one-dimensional charicatures that couldn`t get my interest. Since I don`t really like musicals all that much, maybe I`m a bit biased here.

1473656,4,B00005JLSE,"2002's ""Chicago"" helped to bring about the increased popularity in the Musical genre.  Not only did the movie bring in a staggering $170+ million at the box office, but the film ultimately garnered a Best Picture Oscar as well as a Best Supporting Actress award for Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Is ""Chicago"" all that jazz?

Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) dreams of becoming a star on the Chicago stage.  But when she's double crossed by her lover, she murders him and it seems she's traded a future on the stage to for a prison sentence.  Or has she? Roxie finds herself behind bars with singer/dancer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is accused of killing her husband and sister.  Roxie finds out that Velma has paid off ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah), the prison matron who has helped Velma hire famed lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).

With the help of her husband Amos (John C. Reilly) who pays the $5,000 fee, Roxie is able to obtain the services of Flynn and seizes the fickle tabloid headlines from Velma.  Roxie and Velma's battle for fame and freedom is soon underway.  Will the two regain their freedom and maintain the spotlight or will fate deal them a different hand?

""Chicago"" has been a Broadway hit for a number of years and I have to admit I wasn't sure how the movie was going to turn out.  But, this fast paced adaptation was better than I expected. Each member of the cast shines with his and/or her talent and enthusiasm, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah.  Each actress has her own unique background (Catherine Zeta-Jones was at one time a professional dancer while Queen Latifah has had success as a musician.) Both were nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar with Zeta-Jones eventually winning the honor.

Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly also deserve kudos for their roles.  While Reilly has had some experience in musicals, Zellweger and Gere had to learn dance and singing routines from scratch.

The musical sequences were shot mainly from the perspective of Roxie's imagination.  Each routine was packed with energy and excitement including one notable number by Zellweger and Gere where Roxie was portrayed as a puppet during Flynn's ventriloquist act.  Zeta-Jones' performance of ""Cell Block Tango"", Queen Latifah's song ""When You're Good To Mama"" and Reilly's ""Mister Cellophane"" were also exceptional.

""Chicago"" offers something a little different than most movies out these days. Its blend of music, drama and 1920's lifestyle makes it easy to see why this film was considered the best movie of the year.",1078185600,3,2577,4.981308411214953

1473785,4,B00005JLSE,"The Walt Disney Company and Storyline Entertainment have had a very successful relationship together reviving old musicals which they hope to continue with Chicago. In 1997, they revived Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella which aired on The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC and became a ratings success. Both companies were willing to see if lightening strikes twice so a revival of the old favorite Annie was created for ABC in 1999 and followed in the footsteps of Cinderella. Now that Storyline Entertainment has proven to be a worthy investment, the real test was to revive the musicals for the big screen. The musical has greatly lost its luster since the golden days of the 1930's. The highest grossing musical since 1975 was Grease, which opened in 1978, and the most successful musical in recent memory would have to be 2001's Moulin Rouge with a $57 million take. With that in mind, will Storyline Entertainment find success once again with their film adaptation of the Broadway favorite Chicago or will this be their first failure?
The story of Chicago focuses on the lovely Roxie Hart who has huge dreams about becoming a star like her idol Velma Kelly. She is willing to do anything to obtain that dream which includes cheating on her husband with a guy who claims to have connection in the business. One night Roxie finds out the truth about her secret lover and taking the gun from her dresser, she shoots him once and then shoots him again. After her husband spills the beans, she is taken to jail where she learns that one can still become famous with the right angle and the right lawyer. That lawyer is the flashy Billy Flinn, who has never lost a case with a woman client. Roxie soon enters a new world of deception and greed as she competes with the famous Velma Kelly for the razzle, dazzle lawyer. Who will come out on top in Chicago? The storyline for Chicago is fabulously well done. The musicals sequence strive from the imagination of Roxie Hart which allows the musical to be a musical without the song and dance sequences come off as tacky. Most musicals start out a song with the usual one liner with dancers coming out singing moments later. Chicago thankfully doesn't do that and it works.
The cast of Chicago is truly an Oscar worthy cast. The most fabulous thing about the cast was that each actor and actress did his or her own singing. They may not all hit the right note but the feeling that you get from the film is very gratifying. The biggest surprise from the bunch is Richard Gere who plays the flashy lawyer, Billy Flinn. He really shines in numbers like Razzle Dazzle and All I Care About. Cathrine-Zeta Jones, who is actually a Broadway veteran, really shows off her stuff with great style especially in the opening sequence of the film. Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character Roxie Hart. There could have been someone better then Zellweger to the play this role but she still does a decent job. She definitely has the right look for the role but it was her dancing and singing in the musical that were the big disappointments. John C. Reilly does such a fantastic job especially n the Mister Cellophane number that there is no need mentioning anything else. Queen Latifah was a delightful surprise as Mama Morton. The remainder of the cast does a wonderful job at providing the perfect amount of background characters that you would expect from the Chicago backdrop.
Overall, the film adaptation of Chicago was as good or better then all the buzz suggested the film would be. The songs are amazingly well done with best being Razzle Dazzle, Mister Cellophane, and the Cell Block Tango. The numbers were quite surprising and didn't come off tacky as originally thought. Most of the cast seems to work well except for two. And was said before, Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character, Roxie Hart. There certainly could have been a better to take the role but Zellweger works fine, just not outstanding. The other member who didn't work well was Lucy Liu. It wasn't her but her character that was the problem. Her slight appearance in the film seemed kind of pointless though she does help play out the rest of the story just a bit. They could have done a lot more with her character but it is no real loss. The comeback of the movie musical may have been started by Moulin Rouge but Chicago continues the surge with full force. Chicago is one of the best movie musicals in recent memories and one the best films this year. Make it your priority to see this wonderfully delightful film.",1077321600,3,4575,4.649382716049383
1473786,5,B00005JLSE,"If you don't like musicals, it's a waste of time and money to watch this. Unless you're like me--someone who thought a movie with songs every five seconds isn't a...movie (like SHOWBOAT). But when I saw this, CHICAGO, I saw the error in my ways.
  Anyone who thinks the acting is bad is a terrible judge. Renee Zellweger draws just the right feelings from the audience: she can make you hate, adore, and want to kill the character Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones is at the top of her game as the notorious Velma Kelly (""it was a murder, but not a crime""). I'd like to thank the Academy for giving her the Oscar. And let me tell you: Meryl Streep is my favorite, favorite actress of ALL time (and this is coming from a true movie buff), but I am still so glad that Zeta-Jones got the Oscar. Sorry for your loss, Meryl.
 Don't get me started about how much I loved Richard Gere. Playing the suave, charming, yet self-helping lawyer Billy Flynn, I grin every time I see him come onto the screen. His song, ""Razzle Dazzle"" is my dad's favorite, and a real toe-tapper. The songs are incredible, my favorites being the Cell Block Tango, Both Reached For The Gun, and the ever-lasting All That Jazz. The dances are so well choreographed, too.
  And how can anyone say this movie is boring and slow?! The pace is quick, the acting stupendous, and the dialogue is sharp and witty. This film easily blends humor, drama (HUNYAK!! POOR HUNYAK!!!), and of course songs amazingly well. One of the film's best aspects is its beautiful cinematography. Bottom Line: This is one of the best musicals we've had for a while!",1076976000,2,1605,4.539792387543253

  What I lacked was a solid story, and likeable characters. Everyone is just out for themselves, and they let nothing get in their way. Is this how the American Dream should be? The only character that is sympathetic has really only one line and is hanged in the middle of the film.
  If you want to watch a film about how shroddy the American Dream is, and how unfair its system of justice is, then this might be the film for you. If you want a nice song and dance film I would recommend Moulin Rogue, or Cabaret.",1076803200,4,665,4.253968253968254

1473789,4,B00005JLSE,"It's interesting that a musical that was not a hit when it premiered in the 70s has become such a massive hit as a movie, especially in an era when so few Broadway musicals have been transposed to the screen. Fosse's shows have never been mass audience favorites, dealing, as they so often do, with the darkest sides of the human condition. And yet the film version of Chicago has been a near universal hit.
Certainly a lot of the popularity of Chicago has been a consequence of the popular cast, who may have been hired for their star qualities, but who- without exception- turned in first rate performance. Who would have thought, for example, that Richard Gere would deliver such a good musical performance, or that Queen Latifa would be so good in traditional Broadway material? I'm sure these two alone brought a lot of people into the theater. The real stars of course are Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellwiger, whose song and dance routines impressed even those critics who panned the show as a whole.
I also suspect that part of the greater success of the film over the stage version is that today's audiences are more conditioned to expect the dark and ironic in the musical theater. And this show is nothing if not dark. The message, if there is one, is that content is nothing and appearance is everything. Perhaps, then, ""Chicago"" is the perfect musical for 90s.",1076284800,4,1376,4.690082644628099

I'm not gonna bother telling you what it's about as countless other people before me have already done so, but let's just say it was deserving of winning 6 Oscars in my opinion.  My favourite scenes are All That Jazz, Roxie and Razzle Dazzle - my favourite song from the show.

I had high hopes despite my doubts about Renee Zellweger and overall dislike for Richard Gere. I had high hopes overall, generated from the ""buzz"" surrounding the film.
But I sat in the cinema and nearly fell asleep halfway through. I don't know why. I later got my hands on the DVD and watched it again and appreciated it much more. I don't know what the difference was the second time around, but somehow the film worked more seamlessly and was highly stylized and entertaining to me upon second viewing. I found the performances more compelling, the music more catchy. Movieviewing in general is more a question of your frame of mind when you see a film. The first time I saw it I was annoyed, the cinema was full, and there was an annoying woman next to me who left her mobile on and kept ignoring it instead of just turning it off. And of course in Iceland there are intermissions in the middle of most films, so the continuity is interrupted.
I was especially impressed with the performances of Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly. While the rest of the cast was impressive and obviously did a great deal of preparation for their roles, I simply preferred the smaller, more understated roles.
There is not a lot I can add to what other reviewers have said except to say that if you found yourself in a similar position... not really getting into the movie the first time around, you might want to give it a second chance.",1076025600,2,1557,4.524822695035461

In awe of seductive club singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Roxie meets Fred Cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. However after Roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and Fred has had his  way with her, he reveals that he has no connections in showbusiness.  She shoots Fred Cassely and kills him.  Upon discovering that he had an affair, Roxie's husband Amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and Roxie is sent to jail.  In jail she finally meets Velma Kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale.  The prison Warden Mrs Morton (Queen Latifah) offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Billy is more a showbiz P.R agent than a legal lawyer and manipulates the tabloids into thinking Roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess. The tabloids go crazy for the new girl on the cell block and Roxie finally becomes a star.

I think there are people that hate musicals, and then they write a review about a great musical and slash it to pieces. I know people who hate Beethoven and hate Mozart, and I have to dismiss as irrelevant a review about the 9th Symphony written by somebody who hates classical music.

So, writing about musicals, I can only believe somebody who loves musicals... and of course, that somebody is ME!  I love musicals.  I am my best musical critic, for me, because I really KNOW musicals!  I know which musicals I didn't like so much (Miss Saigon, Candide...) and which musicals I loved (Phantom of the Opera, My Fair Lady, Beauty and the Beast, King and I, Man of La Mancha, Fiddler on the Roof... Joseph...).  I have seen everything great, ten times or more, including The King and I, Man of La Mancha, Cats, Fiddler on the Roof, Evita, etc.... even Show Boat, The Mikado, Pirates of Penzance, Mary Poppins, etc....

I mean... I REALLY KNOW and LOVE MUSICALS!  That having been said...

After having seen Chicago on a big screen 3 or 4  times, maybe more... the verdict is: Chicago is Fabulous!  It is right up there with the best of them.  The songs are great, catchy, really excellent... The dancing is great, the singing is great, the coreography is beautiful... The actors are superb... Queen Latiffa, Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger are all so PERFECT for their parts... Catherine Zeta Jones won an Oscar for her role, and Richard Gere deserved to win an Oscar for his role (but he wins a long applause, from me.)  He actually SINGS his own songs. He is PERFECT for the part.

And Catherine Zeta Jones... Wow!  SHE IS WONDERFUL!  Not only is she BEAUTIFUL, but she is TALENTED!  She REALLY DANCES... not just dances, she transcends into Jazz!  I was hooked on the music of Chicago for weeks...

I love the tunes, the coreography... I love Chicago... it is without a doubt in the same league as the best musicals ever... by that I mean it is in the same league as the best of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan,  Andrew Lloyd Weber, etc.

And now I write this for others: Buy this DVD!  This is really a bargain.  You only pay for it once, and you will have it and be able to see it many times and enjoy it for the rest of your life.

P.S.: I bought the DVD... I have watched it many times, and each time I like it more... I know I will enjoy it many times more.",1074643200,5,2607,4.38830897703549

Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, yeah, we figured they could probably lay the moves onto a good dance routine, but who knew Richard Gere could dance?

1473916,5,B00005JLSE,"This movie is an EXCEPTIONAL piece of art; it maintains original storyline of the Broadway musical yet gives it a modern feel with these fresh, overly-talented actors & if you can catch it, some sarcastic humor & artistic vision & metaphor!! I hardly ever agree with ""the Academy"", so I didn't see this until my mom rented it, (before this my favorite musical was RockyHorror, so I'm not really what you'd call 'mainstream').  I was BLOWN AWAY! So, ok, great movie-making, but then to realize that the actors do all of their own singing & dancing? It's amazing!
The storyline is: We open on prima-donna starlett Velma Kelly, (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who gives a whole new meaning to ""All That Jazz"", she is supposed to be a sister act with Veronica who's missing at this point...in the audience is fresh-faced young Roxie Hart(Renee Zellweger), a girl with so many stars in her eyes she can't see reality and will do just about ANYTHING to ensure her place in Vaudeville. From this point its a fast-paced, intelligent, wryly humorous & on-key ride as everyone attempts their proverbial 15 minutes (and hopefully more) of fame, no matter who gets shot in the process.  Velma is accustomed to being famous & worshipped & therefore getting her way, so she's a bit of a wench, whereas Roxie tries to catch the flies with honey & is fairly naive, but as the story progresses, you see her learn quickly & surpass others at getting AND KEEPING the attention. Billy Flynn,(Richard Gere),is the sly, sarcastic, silver-tongued lawyer hired to help the 2 girls...
Catherine Zeta-Jones has a musical & theater background and it is very obvious as she showcases her many talents: she can sing, dance, act, acrobat, whatever. She's beautifully lethal, charming, and full of class, charisma & hard work. Renee Zellweger, on the other hand had never sung or danced before, yet she plays with the best and DEFINITELY holds her own. She is VERY talented & its almost more endearing that this was her 1st venture into a musical-theatre-type of arena. No one can just be trained to sing that well, they merely work with what's already there....Richard Gere has never been one of my favorites but I now really respect and admire him, he is also full of talent and surprises.  Queen Latifah hits the screen and you know she's serious, seriously funny & talented! Also a surprise cameo by Lucy Liu, it also has John C.Reilly, Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs & popstar Mya.
One last point is this: These 3 stars, Catherine, Renee, & Richard were big stars already and in their own right, this was not needed to push them in better, they did it because they rose to the challenge & were perfectly cast. No one could have done better!  This is not just the movie of the year, but of the last few decades, not since Cabaret have I seen a musical put on film & done right & this one's better!! It deserved every acclaim it got--these people worked HARD...(I've seen it 100 times & can't find 1 mistake). CHEERS!!

Roxie Hart (Zellweger) dreams of singing and dancing in the vaudeville shows of a 1929 Chicago like her idol Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones).  Yet a few wrong steps lead to Roxie living her life on murderers row in the Cook County Clink.  A grim dank lock up she finds herself under the crooked care of the prison Matron Morton (Latifah), who puts Roxie in touch with the legendary lawyer Billy Flynn (Gere).  Milking her husband (Reily) for Flynn's fees, Roxie soon finds herself shot into the limelight created by the media frenzy surrounding her case.  With her career exploding her fellow inmate & former idol Miss Kelly is less than impressed, but need she be worried or will the flavour of the month soon shift once again.
Review
This is not Moulin Rouge and that's neither a good or bad thing as this is Chicago.  One of the biggest hits of the West End & Broadway hits the silver screen with a bang, yet this not just the stage show, this is pure genius.  Taking the song and dance show from the stage was never going to be easy and indeed it has been attempted numerous times in the past but never made it into production.  The problem has always been that Chicago is a theatrical show of pure vaudeville and that won't translate to the cinema, but one day when he was meant to be promoting the conception of the film of Rent to Miramax honchos, director Rob Marshall suddenly had an epiphany regarding Chicago where all the musical elements would take the form of asides or exist as pure fantasy primarily through the mind of Roxie Hart.
A simple premise becomes a stroke of genius, as the audience becomes drawn into a world that quickly sets up its own conventions of communication.  The ease with which this is done demonstrates an understated talent that can only be highlighted here.  One quickly finds the musical elements of the film are never out of sync with the timing of the narrative, lend both poignancy & humour to the film, while always leaving you wanting more each time a number ends.  Indeed one can't help but feel that Marshall is the Billy Flynn we never see, as he razzle dazzles us and gives us our own ""show that is so spendiflorus.""
So what of the singing?  Well like the strength of the cast it can't be faulted as each seems to meld their persona so well into their performance.  Indeed the cast is solid throughout and the cameos by Mya and Lucy Lui are lovely.  One could question the highness of Gere's tone but that aside the stand out performer is without a doubt Zellweger who is both stunning & glamorous, yet vulnerable & fragile which she can communicate through not only acting but also song thus displaying sheer brilliance on her part.  A special mention should also be made of John C. Reily's Amos, never before has anyone captured Mr. Cellophane with such heart.  If you leave this film without feeling higher than you when you came in check your pulse as this had me singing along to the Cell Block Tango and definitely had all that jazz!
The Verdict

If the dance numbers that are both a combination of traditional Fosse and more contemporary styles don't impress you, the melding of story and musical into the narrative certainly will.  Yes this is a musical but suspend your disbelief and let Chicago tempt you with the darkest story of treachery, betrayal and murder you'll ever see twisted into a song and dance show.",1073433600,2,3376,4.562913907284768

I had never seen Catherine Zeta-Jones, but I was impressed with her talent, too.  It was very cool to see them together in a musical because, other than QL, I had no idea that they all had song & dance type talent.  So, for that reason, I guess that I am glad to have seen ""Chicago.""
Despite the raw talent that was oozing from the screen, my discontent with this movie lies in two facts.  It moves (way)too slowly, and it is VERY dark in both appearance and in subject matter.  I even caught myself nodding off a few times....  I would not watch it again.

The only thing I didn't like about it was the overplayed acting by Renee Zellweger; don't get me wrong, she's good--but it was pretty obvious that she tried a little TOO hard in her role as Roxie Hart. (The exagerrated lip-puckering and high voice got REALLY annoying after awhile.) Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelly was a perfect choice, with her powerful singing voice and extraordinary dance talents. As for Richard Gere, he was a terrific choice for Billy Flynn; few other actors alive today could've pulled off that part so well. (Except maybe Jack Nicholson.) John C.

Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweiger) is an aspiring Vaudeville star who shoots her lover, then ends up in jail with her idol, singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  With the help of the slick, slimy Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the women try to get out of jail and return to showbiz.
Though Renee Zellwieger was very good, I thought Catherine Zeta-Jones did the best job in this movie.  When the two sang and danced together, Zeta-Jones was the one I couldn't keep my eyes off of.  She's a trained dancer and singer, so with this film, she was completely in her element.  She definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.
My favorite songs/dance numbers included: ""All That Jazz,"" ""Mr. Cellophane,"" ""Cell Block Tango,"" ""We Both Reached For the Gun,"" and ""Nowadays.""  The song and dance numbers were cleverly done so that they were in Roxie's head, if you don't like the idea of musicals with people randomly bursting into song and dance.  Go rent it today, I strongly recommend it!",1072742400,4,1141,4.815384615384615

As for Chicago, the acting, such as it is, is rather thin and not terribly impressive.  The songs are shallow and mainly dumb.  Sure, there are lots of lights, and custumes, and ""numbers,"" but the entire production had the feel of amateur performers trying to be grown-ups.  Why'd I give it three?  Because I had to leave some room at the bottom for films that have no redeeming value.  This movie has some value as eye candy, but little else.",1072656000,5,687,4.416

The rest is raunchy 1920's flapper girl, gin run culture. Oh, yes the songs are done with gusto, but who would assume for a minute that they would be done as opener for Sound of Music?
Our culture is ripe for such, highlighting the lowlights.  As one reviewer put it so well, this is overproduction, which starts to grate on one's intelligence and taste.  The bright lights and blaring tunes with suggestive sensuality laden is all apprapo to our times, but wait, there are a few of us who agree, this is not what we give five stars for.",1072656000,5,681,4.396825396825397

The musical numbers are exuberant and the cast acquits itself well, but it is all in service of a very thin story that makes some fairly obvious points about the fleeting nature of fame.  The film presents grasping, unsympathetic characters, but I felt that the filmmakers were trying to make me sympathize with them rather than skewering them for their conceit and self-centeredness.  Queen Latifah delivers a star-making performance.
Director Rob Marshall really does his performers a disservice with his rapid MTV cutting between shots.  He should have allowed his cast to generate energy through their performances rather than attempting to construct it with rapid editing and camera angles.  It leaves the question of whether the actors, who are not known for musical ability, were able to deliver sustained high quality performances or whether Marshall had to piece highlights of various takes together to get what he needed.",1072310400,,1168,5.430939226519337

Chicago has a future with my VCR.  I will not be insulted by Moulin Rouge again unless I am falsely arrested and subjected to that miserable movie to coerce a confession.

1474125,5,B00005JLSE,"But I love great work, and this is a great movie.  Rob Marshall has taken the Bob Fosse musical to the screen with such imaginative direction, editing and choreography that he has made it his own.  Not a copy of Fosse, but a nod to him while being fresh and new.  Fast on its feet and clever as hell, it benefits from great original material that is funny, sexy and smart.
The surprising cast of Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Latifah, Gere and Reilly are uniformly terrific.  Who knew John C. Reilly has a beautiful Irish tenor?  They all learned their chops and performed them admirably.
I applaud Rob Marshall  not only for the  clever and imaginative construct of constantly cutting back and forth from ""real"" sets to stage, and the rapid razzle dazzle of the editing and direction throughout, but also for bringing the picture in at 107 minutes.  Many directors today do not know how and when to end their films and they go on and on forever passing a half dozen places they could have ended it (the exception being Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films that are actually better in the extended versions).  Chicago gets right to it and never lets up.
As I titled this review, I am usually not a big fan of musicals, but this film blew me away.  Just great work throughout and it is a real MOVIE, not a filmed play.

It is truly the best film that I have seen in many, many years, and was a brilliant telling of a very classic story.

The vocal talents of actor Richard Gere and those of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are unbelievable. Who knew?

We knew that she was gorgeous, but how she pulled this movie off is truly, truly outstanding. She brings it all together and it is her talent that glues the entire film together and makes it what it is.

1474127,5,B00005JLSE,"""Chicago"" is a sleek, sexy film featuring a powerhouse cast doing their own singing and dancing-- which is surprisingly good and makes this movie just that much more impressive. Director Rob Marshall choreographed the numerous dance numbers, which are energetic, sexy, and entertaining.
The biggest complaint people seem to have about this movie is that they don't like the characters. No, they're not quite the protagonists Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor were in ""Moulin Rouge,"" but they're not really meant to be. ""Chicago"" is, after all a satire and Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, and Gere are all great as slimeballs who are completely oblivious to just how slimy they are. The press, of course, knows but doesn't care since these people help sell papers. The whole point is that our obsession with the scandal du jour has the perverted effect of making celebrities out of people who shouldn't be profiting from their actions.  Look at the media circus that surrounds big trials, and made household names out of Amy Fisher and Lorena Bobbitt in the 90s. Making comparisons to real life, it's not hard to see the point that ""Chicago"" makes.

What do these words have in common? Words chosen randomly to fit into two groups of three? Maybe aliases given by ravErs @ a Mack and Bellvue flashback of yesteryear? Or maybe I was six words short of my word requirement. No, its none of those...it's the opening line of one of the hottest numbers from Chicago. The song entitled ""Cell Block Tango"" uses these key words to segue into the murderous tales of six women on death row. From husbands and boyfriends, Arsenic and gunshots, guilty and not guilty, each woman's story unfurls. Elegantly, the seductiveness of the tango, the danger of murder and the cold hard edge of prison are combined to formulate a dynamic song and dance.
 This is not where the magic ends...actors perform all of the songs! Now this is customary for theatrical performances but very rare in Hollywood. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, and Renee Zellweger did Hollywood Proud. These stars showed their versatility and looked great doing it.
  Just the opposite goes for Queen Latifah. Although her roots have been mostly in music/rap, recently the Queen has been appearing on the big screen. Being a pioneer for women in the rap industry has been her forte; but anyone that didn't know before knows now that her talent extends far beyond that. The Queen's Sarah Vaughn like vocals shine, and add a little flavor to the already all-star cast. Rappers turned actors, actors that sing and dance...what's next, a 7'4 Chinese guy playing basketball?!  J
 I understand that musicals aren't for the butch. Having had a theatrical background, yes I am biased. But don't let the common misconceptions of the musical deter this endeavor. There is no boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, obstacles arise, love overcomes obstacle, and a happily ever after ending while singing all the while. Somehow Chicago weeded out all the corny, sappy, melodramatic goo and replaced it with all the components that put on an enchanting show.
  Gorgeous costumes, beautiful actors, excellent use of color and photography, coupled with an outstanding score and outstanding vocals make this movie a must see. This movie will be enjoyable for all ready to embrace the new face of theater or thespians ready for a new notch in their proscenium arch.

Frankly, I couldn't understand from that song what was being sung and the editing made it obvious that the lyrics were not of importance.
Now think of other musicals that you have seen, The Music Man, My Fair Lady, J.C. Superstar, West Side Story, etc., and think of how many songs that you can remember.  I am willing to bet that there is a vast difference in any of those stage/movie events and Chicago.

1474214,4,B00005JLSE,"""Chicago"" is definitely deserving of its nail-biter Best Picture Oscar win.  Following close on the heels of pop musical spectacular ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Chicago"" is probably the first really successful adaptation of a stage musical to the screen since the 1970s.  It tells the story of adulteress-turned-murderess Roxie Hart and her descent into a life of jazz and fame.  The music is preserved intact from the stage show with just a few deletions and a single addition, and much of the choreography is nearly untouched Fosse.  The set design and costuming are unbelievable, and it's hardly surprising that it took both Art Design and Costuming Oscars.  It's a feast for the eyes and ears.
When I first heard that ""Chicago"" was being adapted for the silver screen, I was quizzical.  When I learned it was to star Rene Zelwigger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere, I had to contain my laughter.  Yet in the theater I was stunned -- they pull it off so perfectly you never even notice.  Catherine Zeta-Jones really shows off her dance background, but Zelwigger does a fine job and when Richard Gere began tap-dancing, it was so smooth that it took a minute to realize how odd the idea was.  Also utterly amazing are Queen Latifah, who belts and struts like nobody's business, and John C. Reilly, who shows the film's greatest emotional depth in his poignant rendition of ""Mr. Cellophane.""  They're so perfect for their roles that I find I can't listen to the Broadway cast now; no one else will ever be able to sing those parts for me.  Why they weren't all Oscar winners is hard to understand; why Richard Gere wasn't even a nominee no one will ever guess.  They're perfect.
The adaptation for the screen is exquisite.  I've never seen the show, only heard the recording, but their trimming seems to have been neat and the film certainly didn't have a broken-up feel.  Choosing not to stick with the stage play's script was essential unless they wanted to end up with a three-hour long experience like ""My Fair Lady,"" which probably wouldn't sit too well with modern audiences.  The recasting of all the songs as fantasy numbers acted out in Roxie's head works well, allowing them to toy with the script and also eliminating the slight oddity modern audiences would find in characters strolling down the street and bursting into song.  It's clear that they're still part of the story; it's probably just not happening quite that way in reality.
As much as I have raved about this film, why only four stars?  The lackluster DVD loses it its last point.  I mean, color and sound are fine; I have no complaints about the technical aspects of the presentation.  It's just that they made such poor use of the format in the production of this DVD.  A single commentary track and a recording of a number cut from the film late in production are the only bonus features to be found.  We needed lots of interviews and featurettes on the making of the costumes and sets.  We needed footage from rehearsals, to see all the trouble our stars had learning their moves.  Speaking of stars, we needed recordings of other actors and actresses who auditioned for the part, to get some sense of what else the film could have been like.  Most importantly, we needed the uncut, multi-angle dance numbers that ""Moulin Rouge"" gave us.  Why none of this is included I can't imagine.  Perhaps they plan to release a supplemental disc or a new two-disc set down the road.  But this incompleteness of presentation loses a star for this otherwise perfect film.",1069459200,2,3534,4.741407528641571

Meanwhile, while making enemies with the famous singer/dancer Velma Kelly who then both compete for media attention. And love stepping over each other's toe's. During this time Roxie daydreams of song and dance numbers at every event she experiences while in prison.
The storyline, the music which fits extremely well and I have listened to this amazing soundtrack over and over again, makes this the best classic movie of all time and is well worth all the awards and nominations. Nothing is played down to the audience and there's no body doubles in this film everyone did their own song and dance.
And from the behind the scene's look that's featured on the DVD this one story is based on a bunch of 'like' stories from around that time - minus the song and dance - but a reporter Mary Sunshine who was played by Christine Baranski in the film - actually wrote stories of women killing their men and writing about them in the paper to get the public to feel sorry for them and which stopped them from getting hanged. She then went onto writing the play which turned into the Broadway Hit with help of Bob Fosse.

1474325,5,B00005JLSE,"Chicago, a film adaptation of the Broadway Musical by Fosse, is brilliantly brought to life in this production starring Rene Zellweger, Katherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere.  With a supporting cast featuring other Hollywood A-List actors like John C. Reiley, Lucy Liu, and the fabulous Queen Latifah, its no wonder that this movie went on to achieve the pinnacle of fame as it swept its way through the Academy Awards this past year.
The story, set in the roaring 20's Chicago of gangster fame, is the tale of Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an ambitious unknown singer whose hunger for fame and fortune leads her into the arms of a man who promises to get her the connections she needs.  Later, when she learns that he is has been leading her to sleep with her, she shoots him in a moment of anger.  Her husband, unaware of his wife's extra-marial affairs, takes responsibility for the crime until he learns the other man is actually the same man who recently sold them furniture.  Roxy is incarserated, where she meets famed singer and dancer, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), who is also in prison for the murder of her husband and her sister.
The musical, which is filmed brilliantly in opposing counter-point of real life incident and elaborately staged jazz song-and dance numbers that narrate the story, is cleverly drawn together, blending musical fantasy with the fascinating story of these women's struggle for fame from inside the ""slammer.""
Desperate to escape public execution, Roxy implores the assistance of Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Latifah), the prison headmaster whose corruptability is equal to her authority.  She puts Roxy in touch with Billy Flynn (Gere), top criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the man who is already representing Velma, to get her out.
The music is sizzling, sultry, sexy, as are the costumes and the actors that work these numbers.  One of the most impressive surprises in this film is that all of the actors sing and dance their own numbers.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is dynamic, performing like a veteran of the Broadway stage with a confidence that equals her talent.  She is beautiful in the role of Velma, and was perfectly cast.  Zellweger and Gere also nail their numbers, bringing a vitality and a sexual tension to their characters that make this movie work as a musical.  One of the surprise performances in this production was that of John C. Riley, who plays Amos Hart, Roxy's estranged and dumb-witted husband.  He brings a sensitivity and innocence to the performance that gives his character as much vitality as that of any of the larger roles in this film.
Running a little over an hour and a half, this is a fabulous film production of a legendary musical.  It is no wonder why this film has had the acclaim that it has.  It is sure to dazzle, entertain, an all that jazz....

Richard Gere's tap number, the ventriloquist routine, and of course All That Jazz.  However, my favorite number is Catherine Zeta-Jones' I Can't Do It Alone.  Wow, now that was dancing.  Velma was my favorite character in the movie.  I didn't really think Renee had too much in the way of dancing to do, so I had a much greater respect for all of the work Catherine had to do for the singing and dancing (and Cell Block Tango?

You'd think there would be way more extras on a best picture winner.  There's next to nothing here.  Which really disapointed me.  I was shocked to find the only things of note to be a tiny featurette,commentary, and a deleted number.

The only thing I didn't like was Rene Zellweger. Before starting, I admit I never liked her as an actress - I don't think she just isn't that good.. Like in Chicago - unlike Catherine Zeta Jones, who surprised many viewers with her singing & dancing ability, Rene Zellweger's voice can best be described as... annoying.

1474328,5,B00005JLSE,"This Oscar-winning movie shows us a 1920's Chicago where booze and jazz fuel people's dreams and disappointments.  Roxy Hart is one of them.  Bored with her life, she dreams of fame on the stage of musical theater.  She has an affair with someone who promises to get her into the theater, but it turns out to be a lie of seduction.  Enraged by this deception and humiliation, Roxy murders the liar.  Ironically, it's this murder which launches her on her way to the fame she always wanted.  After she retains the services of the genius criminal lawyer, Bill Flynn, it's showtime.  Billy remolds Roxy and manipulates the press like a supernatural puppetmaster.  Roxy finally achieves the fame she wished for, but she learns about the transitory nature of fame.
I think this is very relevant to American society today.  We can explore the issues of injustice in the criminal system, the issue of fame in America, and the tendancy of the American press to repeat whatever is fed to it.  You get the impression that those who have money, or those who have a telent for manipulating people will have no trouble escaping from justice, whereas those who have no voice in the world, as represented by the Hungarian woman who was executed, will never get the justice they deserve.  It's important to watch this to get a feel of where American society is going.
Getting back to the movie itself, it is just spectacular.  It's perhaps one of the best musical movies ever produced.  THey split the story between the real world and a fantasy stage.  When they do a musical number, it shifts to the fantasy stage, so there isn't an unnatural feel when they do the musical numbers.  All of the actors give fine performances, and the songs and choreography are top notch.  You'll watch it again and again.  I know I can't stop.",1068508800,2,1811,4.662460567823344

Had the characters been written as seedy and flawed, yet somehow portrayed by the actors as likeable and human, then that would have been amazing acting.

1474399,4,B00005JLSE,"I am a huge fan of movies. I do happen to like some musicals. My mom owns 40 something and has made me endure all 40 something of them. Chicago is a decent musical, but is more of a chick flick musical.
Chicago tells the story of Velma and Roxie Hart. Both vixens have commited murder and are trying to be the biggest vixens in town. They both get defended by Richard Gere's character who is the smoothest working lawyer in town. Will Roxie and Velma go and stay in jail for murder or will they run the night life of Chicago. You will just have to watch the movie and find out.
I liked Catherine Zeta Jones in Chicago. She is one of th most beautiful woman in the world. She is great as Velma. I dind't think she was as good as Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, but Catherine does a worthy job singing and dancing. She has a great voice and dances well. It's funny towards the end of the movie as you can see she is staring to show her pregnancy.
I didn't like Renee Zellweger that much. I don't think she is all that pretty of a woman. Catherine and Queen Latifah easily steal the show in my opinion. She sings and dances all right, but not as good as the others.
Richard Gere is smooth in the movie. This guy was my hero when I was younger and he was married to Cindy Crawford. He does a good job being the lawyer.
Girls and die hard musical fans will like Chicago. I don't think most guys will like it. I can see why it won best picture because it is a good film. It's just not a film I like that much.",1067990400,3,1502,4.043624161073826
1474400,3,B00005JLSE,"I disagree with the reviews that put this film on par with the stage production. As I saw it presented on B'way, Chicago had a sharp-edged cynical sense of humor that put vitality into so many of the projects Fosse worked on. The movie seems to have edged away in the direction of drama, and though the film may seem masterful in comparison to the bloated confusion of Moulin Rouge, Zellweger's, Zeta Jones's, and Gere's heroic attempts at singing and dancing  are off the mark, and the loss of humor is a disappointment. Veteran character and stage actor John C. Reilly, playing the humdrum hubby Amos, ironically provides the most interesting glimpse of the bittersweet energy at the core of the story. Queen Latifah also bucks up the production a bit.
The loss in transition to film is tangible. As presented on stage, the number ""Cell Block Tango"" was laugh out loud funny, as seemingly normal (and, of course, innocent) women expounded on being driven to homicide by acts ranging from gum-popping to more serious infractions. In the film, we get a familiar Hollywood type, [...],who apparently just likes to kill. Yawn. The backing dancers, like the leads, seem to have been selected for something other than dancing ability, and we're left with a pale reflection of what could have been.",1067904000,2,1293,4.850678733031674
1474401,5,B00005JLSE,"Have no fear those who are skeptical of ""Chicago"", this film delivers! Great movie musicals have been, sadly, few and far between for the last 20 years or so. I walked into the theatre to view ""Chicago"" with a bit of hesitation, expecting another poorly organized and sketchy musical version of a Broadway hit. I was blown away, however, by the exciting and original way that director Rob Marshall integrated the engaging story line with the stunning musical numbers. He used a style that has never before been seen on a movie screen. The performances are not to be overlooked, either. Richard Gere is sensational as Billy Flynn. He departs from his usual style to deliver a brilliant performance and he manages to belt out two of the greatest songs in the film like no one else could. Catherine Zeta Jones is sexy and magnificent as Velma Kelly, and Renee Zellweger in stunning and seductive as the idealistic Roxie Hart.

The story is pretty simple. Roxy Hart dreams of becoming a star. And when she is used and tossed aside by someone who swore they would help her make her dream come true, she ends up in jail for killing them. Her way of handling difficult situations, is to transport herself, and those around her, into these elaborate musical numbers. And these musical interludes don't slow the actual story down at all, as is the case in some more recent attempts at movie-musicals...they in fact are without a doubt, the highlights of this movie. The actors more then shine in their respective roles...especially Zellweger, who until this movie, has done nothing but grate on my nerves. Here she makes the character of Roxy her own, and lights up the screen. In fact, the casting is just about perfect...with each person giving an incredible performance.
""Chicago"" is one of those extremely rare films, that's hard to find anything to complain about. Everything from the costumes, lighting and direction go together beautifully, and you feel as if you're transported into their world. and it manages to do what i didn't think was possible...bring the classic movie musical back to life.",1067126400,,1488,4.640151515151516

Richard Gere is the surprise standout with excellent songs and dance routines.
  The un-morality tale seemed stilted and bizarre with little emotional depth. It continues jerkly along until the finale that is probably the worst song and dance number of the movie. The DVD is saved from even a worse rating (2 stars) by the solid and entertaining back up given by the supporting characters.

1474407,5,B00005JLSE,"I was a fan of the original revival recording with Bebe Neuwirth, so when I went to see the movie in Theatres, I was a little skeptical on whether it would be as good as the original stage version.  In fact, the film is just as good if not BETTER then the stage version. All the acting is really good, and the plot is much better then other modern movie musicals (cough cough, Moulin Rouge). If you're a fan of the movie ""Cabaret"" then you'll love ""Chicago"" written by the same people (Kander and Ebb). Velma (Katherine Zeta-Jones) starts it out with the opening number sure to stick in your head throughout the show and when you leave. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) sees Velma on the vaudville stage and she is determined to become a star.  A warning to parents, this is a dark comedy not meant for children under 16. Being that the comedy itself falls around Roxie killing her husband because she's furious, most of it takes place in Jail where we meet Matron ""mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah), one of the show's highlights. The ""Cell Block Tango"" is sure to stick in your head, also featuring  a cameo by Mya (yes, the pop singer).  In the duration of her stay at the Cook County Jail, Roxie  manages to win the heart of lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who decides to help her win the case and get out of jail.  Rivals soon erupt between Velma, who once hold the spotlight and newcomer Roxie. Eventually, everyone is pleased and you end up wondering whether you are or not. As I said earlier, this is a dark comedy and it is made to question you. If you feel kind of confused at the end, whether you should feel happy or angry at them, it is perfectly fine. This comedy makes you think. It questions our judicial system and our society's obsession with Murders and Court Cases.

1474481,3,B00005JLSE,"First, if you did not see this film during its regular theatrical run, I would politely suggest that you *may* want to RENT this DVD before you buy it. Since ticket prices have gotten so high over the past decade or so, I much prefer to watch almost all films via my DVD player, rather than fork over the outrageous cost that is now required, even for a matinee showing. This allows me to rent a DVD at a reasonable price, watch it at my leisure, and review it several times if I so desire.
Which brings me to ""Chicago"". On the positive side, I would say that this movie has excellent cinematography, very good costumes, some very catchy song & dance numbers, and several good performances by the cast. If it really *is* true that the leading actors did their own singing (as is claimed during the film's closing credits), then I must say that, overall, I was very impressed with their performances. I'll be very interested to see if Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and John C. Reilly will be singing again in future films, since they all did a more than adequate job of fulfilling the musical requirements of their respective roles. Hopefully, their voices were not overly ""enhanced"" by any unusual electronic wizardry, and the singing heard on the DVD is very close to what each of them could do during a live, on stage performance.
Furthermore, the DVD transfer is very good, with excellent color and sound. On my 36"" CRT HDTV & attached stereo system, the film came through loud and clear, and I was impressed with all the unusual ""visuals"" that are a part of this very slick production. Thus, all things considered, I thought that the film very much succeeded in bringing this particular musical screenplay to life.
On the other hand . . . well, I dunno. It's definitely a dark and cynical story, with very little ""reason for being"", and no overall depth at all (a very nice exception was John C. Reilly's excellent performance of ""Mr. Cellophane""). It has lots of crude, ""in your face"" sexuality, along with plenty of totally un-necessary profanity. Why in the world so much of Hollywood thinks it's so chic to use the language of an obscene, drunken sailor is beyond me. When I want to listen to that kind of meaningless garbage, I'll buy a ticket for the cheap seats of a second-tier, semi-professional hockey game. Apparently, this must be a requirement for winning an Academy Award these days.
So, while there really are several good singing and/or dancing performances in this film, there's really not a lot that can be said for the underlying story. It's just a series of tunes strung together by a paper-thin premise, and that's probably being generous. Am I glad that I rented it? Actually, yes, since I did enjoy seeing and hearing these actors display their considerable musical talents. And the aforementioned performance by John C. Reilly was enough to make the rental price worthwhile. But I definitely will NOT be buying this DVD, unless I decide to pick up one of the many retread ""cheapies"" that a lot of current DVD owners are offering.
Best picture of the year? Hardly! And ""Chicago"" simply cannot compare to a timeless film musical such as the equally well-done, but much more satisfying, ""West Side Story"". But maybe, like so many others, you'll really like it. As for me, watching this film brought back to my mind one of the many classic sayings from the Book of Proverbs :
""Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.""
In other words, rent first, then buy a ""cheapie"" if you want to add this one to your DVD collection.",1065657600,2,3603,4.666666666666667

Purists will wince and whine at casting choices and production values, but in the end the question must be asked, ""Does it work?""
The resounding answer must be YES!  The movie is fun and captures the feel of a Fosse musical.  I do believe that Bob Fosse himself would have enjoyed this production.  Gwen Verdon would as well, I think.
Including Queen Latifah shows the daring and the risks the producers took, but it also shows how interested they were in bringing this book to the broadest audience possible.
Yes, I would have loved to have seen Bebe Newirth up there on the screen, but every member of the cast holds their own, including Richard Gere (which I seriously didn't expect).
As for the DVD, I would like to have seen more extras, but I guess those can wait for the collector's edition.  For now, this package is enough.

As I heard the results from the Academy Awards, that Chicago had received 6 awards, I simply knew that it would be the best movie of the year.  So, I rented it with great expectations of a movie with emotional actors, glorious dance and singing scenes, beautiful cinematography, and all done with a witty humorous dialogue in a well written, original, breathtaking movie with noteworthy moral value.
I was expecting something spectacular.  Instead I viewed a movie that was rushed, unmoving, lame, with standard acting, standard singing and dancing, standard acting, all performing to a song we've all hear before.  It is your same old typical movie.
Actually, the music was less than standard, with actors that can't sing, or dance, repeating the bad lyrics over and over again created by an obviously talentless insipid lyricist.  I at least expected it to be a visionary marvelous beauty, but in turn it had dull red colors, an old 70's movie atmosphere, with a limited array of dismal colors and didn't sparkle as I had expected.
Musicals usually aren't suppose to be dramatic, but this movie intentionally accomplished this, but when the actually music in the musical is bad, what is left to the movie?  In my opinion this movie was boring, and I actually fell asleep on it, actually, and missed nothing.  The actors didn't have chemistry together, nor did the director concentrate on interaction between the women of the prision.  Characters are introduced, and fade as they preform to the horrible ranting music.
It wasn't very fun, due to the fact that the characters were mindless bimbo female murderers and an arrogant cheating lead actor lawyer that causes a rotten woman to run free, and star in a musical afterwards.  I know this was suppose to just be a fun movie, but it wasn't because the acting and music was so bad.  In this case the movie `Glitter' should have received as much raves.  It simply is not that good.  Now I know that the Academy Awards aren't an accurate rating system.

Many people don't like ""Oklahoma"" because of the character of Judd, a murderous loner, who brings tragedy.  ""Carousel"" tells a story of Billy, a man who learns too late to love, and causes tragedy to those around him.  Both of these musicals are standards of the American theatre.  ""The Thre Penny Opera"" has its supporters and its detractors, but who would deny that it is art?  Some reviewers quoted here appear to loathe ""Chicago"" as a downer.  They appear to want a return to the fantasy-type of musical so popular from the 20's to the 70's.  They do not want any deviation from the ""formula."" Admittedly, ""Chicago"" is meant for adults.

The director  and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.
The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.
Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who  promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.
In the jail, Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere),  is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.
 The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter.  What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.
The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, ""When You're Good To Mama"" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.
The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, ""Mister Cellophane"", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his ""Razzle Dazzle"" number and his tap dancing.
I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for ""Best Picture"". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud. Bravo!",1064620800,18,3592,4.891625615763547
1474613,3,B00005JLSE,"I was a little disappointed when I saw Chicago at the theatre and I felt that same disappointment when I watched it last night on DVD.
All of the principles performed well but, of course, this is a musical and, while Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger and Richard Gere are all fine actors, none is really a singer or a dancer despite the fact that Zeta-Jones began her career on the musical stage.
One can see they gave their parts their all, however.  Zeta-Jones, I think, did the best job; her voice is strong and more centered than Zellwegger's and she's more athletic and rhythmic.
The storyline, of course, was bare bones, though clever and entertaining.  But the musical numbers should have taken center stage and they simply did not.  While there was nothing wrong with any of the musical numbers, none was so well done as to be memorable.  The choreography had to be simplified for the principles and even had their voices been perfect, the music simply wasn't memorable.  Thirty minutes after the movie ended I couldn't hum even one of the numbers.  The thing I remembered most was how beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones looked.  (I liked her hair a lot better short!)
Chicago is fun and quite entertaining and Zeta-Jones, Zellwegger and Gere give it their all, but this movie simply isn't anything memorable.",1064620800,2,1318,4.831111111111111
1474614,5,B00005JLSE,"I rented this for my wife.  She is musically inclined and enjoys musicals and is a very good sport as I make her sit there through movies like ""the Scorpion King"".  I generally hate musicals and was not really looking forward to watching this at all, but did so in the interest of marital bliss.
It is actually really good.  My biggest beef with musicals is that I often can't pay attention while the singing is going on and thus, have no idea how the singing is advancing the plot.  Not so in this movie...you can follow what is going on in the singing portions.
Also, I'm always a sucker for anything that is visually interesting.  I can't imagine how much work went into the choreography, training of the actors, lighting, etc.  It is really something to look at from a visual point of view.  Very stylish and different.
Last, the characters....  They are all really cruddy folks.  Two killers, a slimy lawyer and a corrupt wardeness.  Guess Roxie's husband is not a slime-ball.  This isn't a group of folks that you really wish success for, but they do come out okay in the end.  The story is kind of how slimeballs can overcome the system which isn't great.  You definately wouldn't want to show this to 10 year old kids.  BUT...that being said...I like action movies with stuff blowing up and monters/aliens...who cares about plot and character development.

1474615,4,B00005JLSE,"I think most people know the storyline well by now. Chicago owns it very much to the nifty foot work and dazzling colors by the cast.

The plot by itself, isn't deep. In fact, when I watched it, I find it over-the-top and more comical than anything else. There's hardly any emotional depth portrayed by the anyone in the movie but special commendation goes to Queen Latifah whose single stage appearance for When You Good To Mama stole the thunder from almost anyone in the movie. Academy winner Catherine Zeta Jones also deserved praise for her sultry portrayal of Kelly Velma and the rendition of the songs. Renee Zwelleger's Roxie Hart is good but not exceptional. Richard Gere's vocals are obviously enhanced and I would say John C Riley puts in more than a passable effort than Gere.

The razzle dazzle culminates in the finale scene with Velma and Roxie performing a very slinky and well-choreographed scene for I Move On against a stunning backdrop of bright lights.

1474705,5,B00005JLSE,"After seeing this amazing movie one could very well make a case for this being the best musical ever made.  While ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""An American In Paris"" were both loads of fun and packed with classic moments, ""Chicago"" has one thing going for it that the afrementioned films do not.  It is ""timeless.""  Twenty, thiry years from now somebody somehwere will pop in this movie and declare: ""The topics in this film are as relevant today as they were when it was first written in the 1930's.""  To be honest, I saw the production on stage and was not that impressed with the staging or singing.  However, the talent gathered in this film is absolutely stunning.  Renee Zellweger deserved the Oscar for Best Actress, and would have won if not for Nicole Kidman's nomination and Nicole's previous nomination for Moulin Rouge.  But all the performances are astounding.  All the lead actors dance and sing, most notably and oddly snubbed Richard Gere.  His performance was Oscar worthy without a doubt, conjuring an image of Gene Kelly throughout the movie.  His number ""Razzle Dazzle"" is not to be missed.  John C. Reilly's ""Mr. Cellophane"" is also an extraordinary moment.  What a voice!  All the singing is great, the costumes are incredibly sexy, and the overally filmaking is top-notch. I cannot recommend this movie higly enough.  Thank you for reading my review.",1064534400,6,1370,4.849137931034483
1474706,4,B00005JLSE,"This picture has a lot going for it. The John Kander-Fred Ebb songs fit the cynical story perfectly, have stong melodies and sharp lyrics. There are a pair of knock-out performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah (who knew she had that good a voice?), plus an excellent one from John C. Reilly as Amos. Rob Marshall's direction is a bit too MTV for me; it's as if he's trying to cover up his cast's song-and-dance inadequacies when, at least in the case of Zeta-Jones, Latifah and Reilly, there don't appear to be any inadequacies to cover up. Even Richard Gere seems competent in his tap sequence when Marshall isn't going cut-mad. The main problem is Zellweger. She doesn't register at all, and truly does seem to need her inadequacies disguised by MTV editing. The one time she really dances is in the last number and that's where some of the fastest edits are; maybe she was only good for 2-3 seconds at a time. As for Gere, he was better than I expected but not what the part could have been. I may have that opinion because I saw the original Broadway cast, and got spoiled. Their Billy Flynn was Jerry Orbach (yes, ""Law and Order"" Jerry Orbach), and, to me, no one will ever do it as well. In short, this is a good picture, but it would have been better with less frantic editing and a better lead actress then Zellweger. And yes, give me Jerry Orbach as Billy Flynn -- nobody does cynical better.",1064448000,2,1417,4.496124031007752
1474707,4,B00005JLSE,"Anyone who views this film will spend two very entertaining hours, but I have to admit to a certain amounbt of disappointmnt, particularly as compared to the stage play.  Obviously the film has been thoroughly ""conceptualized"" as a sort of ""Cabaret"" clone, with the cabaret nuymbers transformed into theatrical metaphors (Mr. Cellophane as a baggypants comedian, for example).  Along these lines, the producers decided to hire actors rather than musicians in the key roles, and that's the chief limitation of the film.  Neither of the two main leads can sing much or dance at all, so basically they wiggle and strike a few poses while the camera does all the dancing.  This is disastrous in ""I Can't Do IT Alone,"" (""it"" being her song and dance act with her sister)  where it's obvious that the performer can't do it at all.  Nor does the final number, where the two women are supposed to do their new song and dance act, make any sense since neither of them can sing or dance.  Other actors fare equally poorly.  Queen Latifah is simply miscast as the prison matron.  Her persona and singing style are much too soft and ""matronly"" (in the wrong sense) for such a ""tough as nails broad.""  I can't believe she could have ever gotten control of the inmates.  Even the great John C. Reilly seems uncomfortable in the ill-conceived (Mr. Cellophane is supposed to be anonymous, not abrasive like a baggypants comic) number.  He seems to be asking himself why they didn't hire a real singer for the role.
  Don't get me wrong, though.  Many numbers are brilliant (the ""legal ventriloquism"" number for example), and the show remains extremely entertaining.  But ultimately the movie seems to show that the only way you can get the public to swallow a musical is to make it look like an expanded MTV video.",1064448000,2,1798,4.733118971061093
1474708,5,B00005JLSE,"What a spectacle, the numbers and routines take your breath away.  The approach is clever in that the routines are seen through Roxie's dreams, much more acceptable than the old style musical where everyone on the bus starts singing together on cue despite being total strangers.
The story underlying the glam and glitter is a satire of celebrity status being available for sale , public servants being corruptable and the legal system being open to manipulation.  Some reviewers find this depressing, I agree that it is depressing, depressingly realistic that is.  Despite the lack of ""Yellow Brick Road"" goodness this is a well written, extremely funny movie that is well worth watching.
The performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are superb.  Zeta Jones in particular is nothing short of stunning in the ""All that Jazz number"".
If you are looking for the everything is rosy in the garden musical of old this is not it.  However if you are prepared to open your mind to a satirical musical, look no further.
I think Chicago is worth every award it received and then some.",1064275200,4,1107,4.93010752688172
1474709,4,B00005JLSE,"A film by Rob Marshall
Considering that I saw this movie months after it had won the Oscar for Best Picture, I went into it with somewhat high expectations.  On that level, it was something of a disappointment.  It was a good movie, but not necessarily a great movie, and certainly not the best picture of all of 2002.  Granted, choosing the best picture is an entirely subjective task, but the movie wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.
The plotline of the movie has Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) send to jail for murdering her boyfriend in cold blood, all the while trying to pin the murder on her husband Amos (John C Reilly).  Roxie wants to be a star; she wants to be on stage.  The man she was seeing told her that he had a connection and could get her an audition.  He was only trying to get Roxie in bed.  Roxie ends up in jail and she sees Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones) is also in prison (for murdering her sister).  Velma was a huge star of the stage, and Roxie wanted to be just like her.  Fast talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) takes Roxie's case (along with that of Velma).  Velma and Roxie are also being assisted by the prison warden, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah).  Mama Morton can help out Roxie and Velma get in contact with Billy or make a phone call, but for a price.
The rest of the movie focuses on Roxie as Billy builds up her celebrity so that she can potentially be acquitted of the charges.  There are really two movies here.  First, is the real story of Roxie and how she gets to court.  The other movie here is the musical.  Unlike other musicals where the characters are just walking along and burst into song (and then carry on like nothing happened), the musical numbers in Chicago are fantasy sequences.  They are the imaginings of Roxie Hart (mostly) and give a better picture of her feelings than Zellweger's acting does.  Some of the musical numbers are just so so, but some are actually memorable (two that Richard Gere does, oddly enough).  There is a routine where Roxie feels that she is just Billy's puppet, and this was fantastic and the best one of the show.  Billy is in court and basically tap dances around a tricky situation, and we see Billy actually tap dancing.  John C Reilly gets one number, and that man can sing!  The real star of the show was not Renee Zellweger, but instead was Catherine Zeta Jones.  Sure, Zellweger was the lead, but Zeta Jones was the reason the movie was a success.  Nobody else commanded your attention like Velma.  Anytime she sang or danced, I couldn't look away.  Without question, she deserved her Oscar.
The movie talks about how celebrity is power.  If a celebrity can build up her image, she can literally get away with murder.  All they need is the right angle to play and maybe a fast talking lawyer.  Think about the parallels today: the biggest is obviously the O.J. Simpson case with Johnny Cochran as the lawyer.  But, any big case becomes bigger and more spectacular when the personal on trial has (or gets) a measure of celebrity.  Roxie Hart may be the lead character, but there are no heroes.  The only truly likable and sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, and he is a pushover.  We aren't supposed to relate with Roxie or Velma, but rather to look at how celebrity can corrupt the judicial system.
I know that Chicago won Best Picture.  I know that it was well regarded, and I'm not saying that it isn't a good movie.  It just wasn't a great movie.  To put it simply: Chicago did not live up to the hype.  All the ingredients were there, but it was a little underwhelming.  The only thing I can attribute this to is that Renee Zellweger, while she did a good job, could not command the screen.  She is fine in her role, but she is lacking in the power necessary to command attention.  Catherine Zeta Jones is an example of an actress commanding the screen.  If she was the lead, we might have had a different movie, but Roxie would have been a much stronger character (and thus the movie would have been stronger).  It's a good movie, not a great one, and there were better movies in 2002.",1064275200,,4104,4.4404283801874165
1474710,1,B00005JLSE,"To waste the time, talent and treasure on this film was too bad. Katherine Zeta-Jones is a very talented and stunningly beautiful woman, and she was the highlight of the film. Some other reviewer mentioned that various musicals have had cynical edges but the difference is that these classical musicals had a redeeming thread of morality.  Though the characters may have had a lapse or some were just ""bad"", there was an accord about what was permissable for human beings in society. There are no ""good guys"" in ""Chicago"" and no one to root for, no underdog whom you can relate to, no reason not to hang the two ladies. And you don't even care.  Add to that the freakish surrealism of the filming style and you have a long and unpleasent viewing experience.",1064188800,12,757,4.641791044776119
1474711,5,B00005JLSE,"It took me a long time to even rent this DVD, not because I don't love musicals of all kinds, but because I could never stand Fosse's choreography. Everyone always looked like their limbs were disjointed. But, last week my 40-year-old son and I were comparing movies, and he told me he loved ""Chicago"" and suggested I rent it. Well, I loved it, too. Most of the choreography was more in keeping with the old-fashioned hoofer style, but I saw Fosse's style in the ""He Had it Coming"" number, and it was great. For those of you who wanted a sweet lovely musical, just try to find one. All of them have some sort or conflict--for heaven's sake, Oklahoma had a murder, and Sound of Music had people fleeing for their lives from a Nazi invasion. Chicago is a beautifully crafted musical satire of the Twenties, and it's full of energy, great singing and dancing by people you'd never think could sing and dance. CZ-J put a hard edge on her character and changed her speech patterns to add reality to the time and the place she was portraying, and she did it brilliantly. To those of you who were shocked by the hardness in this film, we have one thing to say to you, ""That was the Chicago way!

1474712,2,B00005JLSE,"Chicago, 1929. Crime. Passion. Celebrity. Sex. And jazz...
I will say from the start that I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, I would have expected to see a movie, being worth indeed 6 Oscars. From my point of view this is not a movie for Oscar awards. On the other hand, I have to admit that it is well done, made by intelligent and creative people.
But I can't help it and mention that some details of the movie show a slip of the makers' attention: one of the characters speaks Russian and has a Russian name, but they say she is Hungarian and a cabaret dancer had her silk stockings broken during a preformance.
Roxie Hart, an apparently innocent actress, dreams of changing her monotonous life thanks to her talent. She is attracted by the idea of becoming as famous as Velma Kelly, a well known vaudeville actress. She sees her dream come true when, due to some unusual circumstances, she finds herself in jail, next to her idol, both of them beining accused of murder.
This is a nice satire at the address of Chicago and its legal system, at a time when jazz was gaining fans and alcohol was prohibited.
I also admire the creativity and the rich imagination the movie makers proved when they associated the jail atmosphere with a stage where prisoners performed their own acts.
I am not at all a fan of musicals, but I did not get bored watching this movie and I don't regret seeing it. But I would not see it a second time.
I recommend this movie only to musical fans or to those who are great admirers of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zeleweeger or Richard Gere. It will be interesting for you to see them in different roles from what you were used before.",1064188800,,1679,4.436893203883495

I was pleasantly surprised at Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellweger's singing and dancing ability, that much I will admit. However, I would recommend that you rent this movie before you buy it. I bought it before seeing it at the recommendation of a friend, and unfortunately wasted my money. It's not a movie I want to watch again.",1064102400,11,753,4.844961240310077

To be perfectly honest, I'm not a huge musical fan, but this film and the sound track for it is just so enjoyable you don't have to be a huge musical fan to enjoy the film and the performances by these great actors.
The premise:
The setting for this film is Chicago in the twenties which makes it the perfect setting for the entire film as it is learned in the ""Behind the Scenes"" special that it is somewhat ground in the true story of several women killing their husbands or boyfriends and the huge media blitz over their trials.  Taking that into consideration and the timing of the film, being in the twenties when women were struggling for more rights, you have all the ingredients for the plot of ""Chicago"" and then throw in the musical aspect and then throw in several exceptional actors and actresses and you have ""Chicago.""
Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart who is a nave young woman married to an older, blue collar working man who is gone all day.  Take that aspect and her ""intense"" desire to be on stage doing her jazz singing and dancing.  Being a bored housewife, she hooks up with a little side action in the form a furniture salesman who feeds her a huge line about getting her hooked up with somebody at the local jazz club.  After several weeks of believing his line about getting her on stage, he finally becomes tired of her nagging and tells her he's just a furniture salesman and doesn't know anybody at the club.  She becomes so distraught about being lied to that she whips out a thirty eight and puts him down right at the front door.
Her poor sap husband, played so brilliantly by John C. Reilly initially tries to take the blame for her, right up to the point in which he finds out that the body laying at the front door was the guy who sold them their furniture and boom, he drops the story and off to jail goes Roxie.  It's in jail that she meets up with Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) and Velma Kelly who is played so brilliantly by Catherine Zeta-Jones who seems to have been born for singing and dancing.  Velma has been in jail for some time now after the films exceptional opening with her on stage singing and dancing ""All that Jazz.""  It seems she found her sister in the bed with her husband and she whacked the both of them.  Richard Gere shows up not too long after that as Billy Flynn, the big shot lawyer in Chicago that has never lost a case.
What follows from there is nothing less than the best musical to hit the silver screen in years that will have you smiling from ear to ear from the very opening of the film to the credits.

When Roxy is faced with his lies, she takes her revenge.

Thus begins the story of ""Chicago,"" the razzle-dazzle musical about people who will seek fame at any price, whether via show business or indictment and trial for murder.  Either one of these is sure to grab headlines.  Richard Gere's character, the more than slightly sleezy lawyer, Billy Flynn, is more than happy to represent Roxy Hart, for a price.  Flynn also represents the singer/dancer and fellow felon, Velma Kelly, portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is in competition with Roxy Hart for renown.

The premise of ""Chicago,"" and a very cynical one, is how the press, hungry to sell newspapers, often thrust those least deserving into stardom.  Fame is fleeting; once the public gets bored with the latest flavor of the month, the media move on to the next flavor.  Note the case of O.J. Simpson, and his would  replacement, Robert Blake.  Of course, in between, Osama Bin Laden was abruptly forgotten in ""favor"" of Sadaam Hussein.

""Chicago"" is a truly entertaining and enjoyable film.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, in real life is an honest to goodness singer and dancer, is simply wonderful as Velma Kelly.  Zeta-Jones' rendition of ""All That Jazz"" is a show stopper.  Renee Zellweger lends a little girlish quality (ala Marilyn Monroe) to her scandalously trampish portrayal.  Richard Gere's performance as the lawyer has just the right touch of slickness required by the role.  It is quite gratifying that although neither Zellweger or Gere are profesional dancers, they both turn in applaud-worthy and polished performances.  John C. Reilly, as Roxy's hapless and cuckolded husband, does a heartbreaking turn in his number, ""Mr. Celophane,""  the man everyone sees through because no one knows he is there.  Queen Latifah steals the show as the ""lets make a deal"" prison matron.  She is sexy and deliciously sardonic when she takes center stage in ""When You're Good To Mama.""

My only criticism of ""Chicago"" is that while the musical numbers are often terrific, the movie too often feels a little bit overloaded with them.  I also often asked myself, ""Is the public really so naive that they would fall for such obvious phonies"" as dramatized in the film?  I guess that some people do have the need to identify with the latest, current fad, even if, as Andy Warhol said, the fame is over in 15 minutes.",1063929600,3,2652,4.932279909706546

This is a story of real people; their hopes and fears, what drives them, and the inner demons that they must overcome. I found the story gripping, emotionally captivating, and ironically amusing. And, the music is superb. Every song is melodic and memorable, and the lyrics are first rate. Some person complained that the movie ""symphathizes with killers and those who set them free"". Hogwash! It actually pokes serious fun at a system where this is allowed to happen. This is called ""satire"". Go borrow a dictionary and look up this word. As for the old style musical that some individuals praise and celebrate, some are good, some are ok, and some dreadful. I love the songs from ""The Sound of Music"" but I cannot sit through it's hours of cotton candy sticky sweet mishmash. It's Horrible, Simply Horrible.

I thank goodness I didn't see this in the theater, there is no way I could've sat through the whole thing, fortunately my dvd player allows me to speed through movies with sound so at least I got through the whole thing in half the time.  I kept thinking it just *had* to get better, but it didn't.  The characters were pathetic and completely nondeveloped.  The story line sounds more interesting than it is, honestly!  I've never seen Renee Zellweger look worse, throughout the whole movie I just had to keep blurring my vision to make seeing her bearable... and I loved her in Bridget Jone's Diary and even Me, Myself, and Irene, so it's not like I'm asking for much.  I tried so hard to like this movie and I just couldn't.  If you, like me, realize in the first 10 minutes that this is a truly horrible ludicrous movie, don't bother continuing to watch in the hopes that it will get better, it doesn't, I promise, I don't care how much money you've invested it's not worth the added insult of wasting your time.  Maybe if you are a big fan of CZJ (I'm not, but I did love her in Blue Juice and I usually loathe surfer movies).... naaah, even then it's not worth it, she's so done up and over the top it's just down right creepy and annoying.

1474894,5,B00005JLSE,"I haven't seen many musicals on Broadway, Chicago is one.  I enjoyed the stage version very much, but the film is superior.  It is all about the way the film is edited, seamlessly moving back and forth between reality and the inside of Roxy's head.  It is a lot of fun contrasting between the harsh reality of 1930s Chicago and the fantasy world of Roxy Hart.  This had a lot of 'train wreck' potential, but the directors pulled it off wonderfully.
Several have commented about the plot.  Okay, I'll admit it too, the plot is weak and a bit far fetched, but isn't that typical of a musical?  Has anyone ever actually seen a bunch of sailors going off on shore leave and breaking into song while standers by join in (On the Town)?  Do you really believe that a whole town could be sucked in to buy musical instruments from a man that can't play a note (Music Man)?  Haven't you heard of suspending reality?  Chicago is different because it does the most convincing job of integrating the musical numbers into the story line.
Get the DVD.  Watch the transformation between reality and fantasy.  Notice the difference between how Roxy imagines Billy F, and the way he really is.  This movie is fun, the music is memorable, Bob Fosse would have almost been pleased.",1063756800,3,1261,4.555555555555555
1474895,4,B00005JLSE,"The art of making any musical in the mainstream has been long lost, until now.  Chicago is a satire musical, satire meaning over-the-top, impossible, just hilarious stuff.  There is no doubt this movie has a dark side to it, but the music is so good and the actors pull everything off beautifully.
  I have to say that ""Velma""(Catherine Zeta Jones)really steals the show here, even more than Richard Gere does.  Aparently Catherine has been in theatre and done musicals before, it shows.  She has this incredible flow and energy out there, she would lite up a stage no doubt about it.  There was basically no weak link in this cast at all, they all suprised me.  Who knew that Renee Zwelleger, Richard Gere /Katherine Zeta could sing so well!!  They really suprised me in this movie.
  The best aspect of the movie by far is the way the dream sequences and regular scenes are blended together so well, they flow right into one another.  People just do not bust out into song, you know it is coming and feels right at the time.  This method could have been butchered, sloppy and disaterious for the movie, but they pulled it off wonderfully.  The electricity that is required in a live musical is here and grabs your towards the screen, of course the short costumes help also.
  I liked the set designs, it had the look of the 20's and the feel of it.  The craziness of the times was there on screen and it added the finishing touch to the movie.
  As I said before, this is a satire.  A satire basically pokes fun at a subject, the impossible and outlandish are required for it.  Try not too take the plot too seriously and just enjoy it.  There are actually truths to this plot, while they are exaggerated, they are still there.
  Overall a masterpiece of a musical, funny, well thought out and the music just makes the movie come alive.  Highly reccomended to anyone.",1063756800,4,1869,4.523952095808383

I'd been worried that Rob Marshall would not do a good job in translating the play to the screen, but he did a very creditable job.  What worried me most is the placement of the song-and-dance numbers.

The movie's plot is terrible.  A hopeful starlet, Roxy, shoots the man that she is having an affair with after she learns that despite what she thought, he has no connection in the nightclub world and will not help her get a gig.  She goes to prison where she meets another murderess/singer, Velma, and Mama Morton, a prison mistress that is the least developed of a string of underdeveloped characters.  Several bad musical numbers follow, Richard Gere's character eventually gets both Roxy and Velma off and they become famous.  Great writing, huh?
The manipulation of the justice system in this movie is preposterous.  How is it remotely possible that not one, but two murders get off scott free and then become stars with their own show about, you guessed it, glorifity murder.  Obvisouly, this is not a morality musical.  It doesn't have any good moral in it all.  It is just a stupid story with unlikable characters.
People say that the musical numbers in this movie were great.  I can't see how this is true.  These tunes are so unharmonic that its not even funny.  Mr. Cellophane?  He had it coming? What is this terrible cacophony?  In general, I'm not a hater of musicals, unlike some other reviewers.  I just hate this one.  If you want to see a good musical, see Paint Your Wagon.  That is at least amuzing and has likeable characters, including Clint Eastwood.
Overall, I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is very very overrated and was a huge waste of money to produce.  I wish that I had the four dollars back that I paid to rent it.  I could have thrown that money down the sewage and gotten more satisfaction.

This is 2003 and recently we have experienced Evita, Little Voice, Moulin Rouge and NOW - Chicago.
The film has borrowed a lot in style from Bob Fosse`s CABARET 1972. There are killer moments such as Cell-Block Tango and Roxy`s Press Conferance.
BUT; to put Catherine and Renee in high profiled musical roles has its short comings. Cathy may have played the West End a decade ago, but her high kicks simply isn`t enough. She can be played down by any number of talented musical stars in Europe and the US. Renee? She is NOT a sexpot! Period! She tries valiantly and has her moments; but it really should have been a Marilyn Monroe-type.
Critics hail this as the biggest thing! Have they gone mad? Have dare they compare this with the MGM greats 1939-1958, Busby Berkeley, Judy Garland, The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Bob Fosse, Barbra Streisand and the Minnellis? These products, artists and creators are of legendary fame and DESERVEDLY so...
Cbicago IS IMPORTANT, and of good work. But a masterpiece? The only reason THE PIANIST(about horrors during World War II) lost at the Academy Awards was the times... The Iraque-""crisis"". Naturally a musical was rewarded and not the horrors of a war...This is how it has always been! People don`t want 2 sorrows of war when their in the midst of it.

When she kills her lover in a fit of rage, she doesn't realize how close she's about to become to her dream.  In prison, she hooks up with lawyer Billy Flynn, and another singer in prison, Velma Kelly.  Watching Velma work Billy and getting her name in the paper is all Roxie needs.  She lures her husband into supporting her legal problems and hires Billy to be her attorney.  Before she knows it, Roxie is more famous then she ever dreamed she'd become.  Intersped with musical numbers that help tell the story, Chicago is a satire about the control the media holds over it's audience.
If you're a fan of musicals, or even if you're not, you will truly enjoy the musical numbers in Chicago.  They have a twenties theme and are worked very well into the context of the story.  The performances are outstanding, with my personal favorite being Richard Gere as Flynn.  This was definitely an underated performance.  One flaw with the film is it's lack of likeable characters.  Roxie is hardly likeable in the ways she treats her husband, and what she will do to be famous.  Velma is an arrogant woman who sees herself in a higher light then everyone else.  Billy is a lawyer who only cares about the bottom line.  And, Roxie's husband Amos, probably the most sympathetic, is also a fool, making him hard to like.
The DVD is a little bare as far as DVD's go.  Only three extras to speak of, an informative behind-the-scenes documentary which runs 30 minutes, a director's commentary, and a four-minute musical number with Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones which was cut.

There are 2 reasons I gave this movie 2 whole stars. One is Queen Latifah (who stars as Matron Mama Morton). The other is John C. Riley (starring as Amos, Roxy's husband). The leads were fine, but the whole movie I wanted to see more of Amos, who was the only sympathetic and also one of the only interesting characters in the movie. John C. Riley is one of the best supporting character actors of our time, and I can't wait until he starts to get larger roles. And I absoloutly loved Queen Latifah, who filled the movie with more sass and spark than Renne Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere combined.
This film was so processed and unfortunatly very BORING, not because it was long or because I don't like musicals, but because it was bland. Behind all the sparkle on Renne's little tap shoes and the false eyelashes one Catherine, what else is there?

This was first written by a journalist who was living in the time that this took place (the 20's). She wrote a book and it was made into a musical. Then there were a few movies made based on the musical, but not a one turned out too well. Director Rob Marshal thought it would be a great idea to make another movie, but this time it would be with most of the musical numbers.
He took on a difficult task to make this film, and make it good. The actors were hand picked for their talent and their ability. The costumes worn by the characters throughout the film were ALWAYS eye catching and were the style of the 20's with a flair of the 21st century. There weren't any doubles for the singing and dancing either.
The film opend with the memorable song titled ""All That Jazz"", and went on from there. All of the musical numbers after that come from Roxie Hearts mind. This is because almost all she ever thinks about is being famous on stage, her name in all the papers.
Then a bargen goes wrong and she lands herself in jail with the notorious Velma Kelly. Roxie compeats with Velma for the headliners with the help of Billy Flyn, the greatest female criminal lawyer in all of Chicago.
Billy and Roxie stretch the truth enough to get her out and chase her dreams of being on stage. But, again, things don't work out as planned. Same goes for recently freed Velma. So, since ""one jazz killer isn't enough"" they help each other out.

So if you don't like this movie, that's fine. But just understand what you are talking about before you go making your comments. You can't trash a movie when it's based off of a musical that is based off of facts.

I'm a huge musical theatre fan, and I love a happy ending as much as the next gal, but dark musicals like this are FUN to watch if you have the right expectations. Is Chicago the best musical ever? No, and its not even my very favorite show but this movie is a wonderful version if you can't see the stage show.  These characters are not always ""lovable"" but they are very much human, and they appeal to the ""dark side"" of everyone. Yes, they are murderers, but if you see the stage version, they don't take themselves seriously at ALL. The six women on the Broadway soundtrack make funny accents and are by no means acting like ""cold-blooded murderers"". But I digress. The movie version DOES take itself more seriosuly than the show, but that doesnt make the characters detestable. If we look hard enough, who DOESN'T see a bit of themselves in Velma or Roxie? Who hasn't wanted to perform on stage in front of an adoring audience? Who doesn't love to dance and sing? With that being said, the music for this movie is WONDERFUL and somewhat true to the stage version. Zeta-Jones and Zellweger give (suprisingly!) wonderful performances, as does Richard Gere. They really put themselves out there by (gasp) singing and dancing, and I can't believe how negative some of these reviews are. If you don't like stories of greed and murder, then don't watch this. If you want to see fun, dazzling show-stopping numbers sung by scantily clad murderesses-turned-showgirls, then Welcome to Chicago!",1062720000,9,1754,4.676375404530744

But there are some very good scenes (all of which belong to Richard Gere).  Richard Gere stole this movie in my opinion.  It seemed that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellwegger were only supporting players.  True, the characters left a lot to be desired, but Richard Gere played the sleazy lawyer perfectly.  Most of the songs in the movie were lousy.  You're not going to get a great message out of this movie.  But for pure entertainment, watch the Richard Gere parts!

As musicals go, it's just ok.  I can't believe it got all the hype it received including best picture.  The characters are all interesting, especially Queen Latifah, who makes the most of a small role.  Gere and Zellweger are their usual passable selves, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, as another convicted killer looking for a way out also does things pretty well.
The problem is, that when musicals insist on making everything musical, it gets in the way.  I swear, not one important point is spoken in this film, it's all sung.  That gets on my nerves.  Since the performances are good, not great and the story is average at best, this film would appeal to only real musical fans, or fans of the performers.

This highly sarcastic and visceral song was for me the highlight of the Broadway musical and to have taken it out took out some of my joy upon viewing. I equate this to making an ironic omelet and leaving out the satire.

I'd be afraid they would stab me in the back, but Rob Marshall creates a musical full of bright colors, great turns from the actors ""in both worlds,"" and provides a mirror into our celebrity obessesed culture that should hopefully have us thinking long after Velma and Roxie take their final bow. Catherine Zeta-Jones is fiery, funny and wonderful as Velma. I found myself waiting until she was back on screen. 'All That Jazz,' 'Cell Block Tango,' and 'I Can't Do It Alone' showcase her dancing legs and singing chops. Queen Latifah's 'When Your Good To Mama' was another highlight for me.

This story is not only cynical, simplistic and unsympathetic--its also flawed. The characters were all very unsympathetic and corrupt--the only two redeemable ones getting shafted or executed. A story doesn't have to be uplifting or happy to be good.  But it does have to be complete. The fact that Roxie's devoted husband just sort of meanders and disappears into the night is a violation of story-telling on the highest order.
I'm indifferent to musicals--I'll state that upfront.  And yet, comparing Chicago to Moulan Rouge, I have to say that I'm shocked at the number of awards Chicago won.  Moulan Rouge seemed superior to this movie in every way to the eyes of this layperson.

1475173,4,B00005JLSE,"The movie musical was a popular form of entertainment, as well as a dependable source of income for studios, from the advent of sound in the 1920s until the late 1960s. The genre's zenith, at least in terms of financial results, was achieved in 1965 with the release of the wildly successful ""The Sound of Music"". Afterwards, there were a few big hits, [notably ""Oliver"" and ""Grease""], but changing times and audience tastes forced movie musicals into virtual extinction by the late 1970s.
The genre returned with a bang in 2001 with the release of ""Moulin Rouge"". This was not your mother's musical. The pace was frantic, and the style was closer to MTV videos than to ""Singin' in the Rain"". Here was a movie for the 21st Century - frenzied, yet still stylish and vastly entertaining. Now comes ""Chicago"", which, though more traditional than ""Moulin Rouge"", is a fresh, inventive movie that is quite in keeping with today's tastes in entertainment.
The movie is based on the hit Broadway musical, which itself was based on an old play about flappers, showgirls, murder and music in late 1920s Chicago. Roxie Hart [Renee Zellweger] and Velma Kelly [Catherine Zeta-Jones] are arrested for different murders and sent to Cook County Jail. Both are defended by suave, cynical Billy Flynn [Richard Gere], who sees them less as clients than as great publicity tools for his burgeoning legal career. Velma has a singing and dancing career. Roxie dreams of one. The movie cleverly uses Roxie's dreams and fantasies to introduce some great musical numbers, some of which are real showstoppers.
One of the best things about ""Chicago"" is that none of the performances are faked. Everyone does his or her own singing and dancing. That's no surprise when it comes to the marvelous Queen Latifah, who plays the conniving Matron `Mama' Morton, or to Zeta-Jones whose career began on the musical stage. But who knew that Gere is a great singer and can even tap dance up a storm? Or that Zellweger is even more talented than we already thought? Or that the amazing John C. Reilly, who plays Velma's naive husband, sings beautifully?
`Chicago' is a real treat. Whether the movie musical is experiencing a true revival remains to be seen. I, for one, hope that it is.",1062288000,9,2248,4.841558441558441

She gets off the hook thanks to the manipulations of a fast-talking lawyer and her tough-as-nails prison matron, but then she no longer makes headlines.  But not to worry, she hooks up with another celebrity-murderer for a sisters-in-crime act.  Some of the songs are excellent -- even Richard Gere shows that he can belt them out -- there is some clever cross-cutting between plot events and cabaret acts, and we are spared the traditional, offensive boy-girl romance.  However, the transition from stage to film is somewhat inept: the story takes place almost entirely in dingy backstage rooms and on a claustrophobically confining prison set. I wanted exteriors of gin joints, tenements, and society mansions.
I also became increasingly uncomfortable with the dozens -- maybe hundreds -- of women writhing against each other in leather bikinis. Is this standard issue prison garb?  There are acres and acres of female bodies in almost total undress, but only two shots of shirtless men, both extremely brief.  The gorgeous Richard Gere remains staunchly suited througout.

The music, dancing, and acting are wonderful, and the editing of dialogue scenes mixed in with the musical numbers enhances the experience.  It is very difficult to turn a great theatrical experience into an equally great cinematic experience.  'Chicago' succeeds at this by staging all the musical numbers as stage performances, but using close-ups and cut-aways to add a visual quality that only a movie can.  Those who dislike the movie because of its characters being crooked and amoral are missing the satiric edge of the script.  We are not meant to love these characters, or root for them, but to laugh at the society that allows itself to be flim-flammed by lawyers and the media into siding with adulterers and murderers.

Chicago isn't strange, mind blowing, and spectacular like Moulin Rouge, but it was still pretty cool. In terms of musicals, it isn't the best one, but it had a cool story. I would still choose Moulin Rouge or Grease over this, but I thought that they did a very good job with the movie. To me, this was about the world of Hollywood and gossip and trying to stay in the spotlight. In a time when there aren't many musicals and they usually aren't accepted that readily by the public, this star-studded movie did very well at the box office.

Both actresses were terrific, but I honestly believe the movie is better than the stage version, and Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are phenomenal.  Richard Gere, too, was a wonderful surprise.  Contrary to what one reviewer said, I found his voice to be perfect for this role.  Billy is not supposed to be a fabulous performer.  He's a con man, he tap dances around the truth, everything is flash.  So Gere's NY nasal singing voice is perfect for this character.  Ditto with Zellweger.  One reviewer complained about how thin her voice is.  Hey, Roxie is a wannabe, not a star.  Zeta-Jones is the star who is supposed to be fabulous (and she is).  Roxie is the pretender.

One day she shoots her lover in a rage at his betrayal. In prison she meets Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who was Chicago's most celebrated showgirl until she shot and killed two people. Velma has retained the city's most successful defense lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who never fails to produce acquittals for women indicted for murder. Roxy also seeks Flynn's representation and quickly becomes his star client. The two women compete for headlines, trial dates, public sympathy, and all the stardom that their crimes can get them, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of each other and of the public's taste for the latest spilt blood.

Director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon have successfully adapted Bob Fosse's popular musical ""Chicago"" for the screen. The production is spectacular. The ""stagey"" musical numbers and more conventional dramatic scenes are well integrated. Dion Beebe's cinematography is creative and impressive. My only criticism of the film is that some of the more circus-like musical numbers struck me as overproduced and over-stimulating. Many modern stage musicals become ensnared in the trap of overproduction, which can do more to distance the viewers from the musical numbers than to draw the audience into them. Some of that seems to have carried over into ""Chicago""'s movie version. But the performances are good. Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere cope admirably with the challenge of singing and dancing in a musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a standout performance. She unabashedly plays her character over-the-top, belts out every song with great conviction, and really sells her performance. Another  impressive performance comes from Queen Latifah, who plays the women's prison warden, Mama. She also holds nothing back, and it doesn't hurt that she is a singer by profession. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah both have considerable stage experience, as well as being blessed with screen presence, which might explain their ability to bring great energy and a larger-than-life quality to this film version of a Broadway musical. If you're a fan of musicals, Chicago is a must-see. If you're not...well, musicals aren't everyone's cup of tea.

1475275,5,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is a movie that you just cannot help but love. It has an all star cast, a great musical score, and a plot that is so far-fetched, it is nothing but a good time. Though the action of the film revolves around a group of women who kill their significant others, a publicity hungry lawyer, and a less than noble women's prison warden-hardly the best society has to offer-it does not attempt to be anything but fun.

The DVD has a bonus track of a number omitted from the film which is fun to watch, though omitting it from the film was probably a wise choice, and behind the scenes shots which is a plus fo0r any movie buff.
Many reviewers of the film wondered if Chicago's success is the beginning of a new era of Hollywood musicals. This is hard to say. If we look at some of the great musicals of yesteryear, particularly the great MGM musicals and Twentieth Century Fox's versions of the Rogers and Hammerstein greats, and consider that studios were able to take implausible plots, set then to music, add an all star cast,  put money behind the project, trusting the talent of all involved and the movie going public to support such projects, and have great success, then perhaps Chicago is the beginning of a new era.

1475276,4,B00005JLSE,"The marvelous movie musical ""Chicago"" is finally out on DVD, though fans of the Oscar-winning film might be more than just a little disappointed with its poor treatment in regards to DVD-extras and behind-the-scenes material.  Despite this, it is very much worth owning.
Hollywood has a notorious track record of butchering popular Broadway musicals when transferred to the silver screen.  What musical theatre fan doesn't cringe the atrocities of ""A Chorus Line,"" or, dare I say, ""Evita""?  Luckily, this particular musical-to-film translation is completely on target.  Under the direction of Broadway director/choreographer Rob Marshall, the film of ""Chicago"" remains mostly faithful to the original 1975 production and the 1996 Broadway revival.
I will spare you a synopsis of this film.  What I will say, though, is that ""Chicago""-set in the roaring twenties-is a brilliant satire of our modern-day obsession with the proverbial ""media-circus"" and the criminals that become celebrities as a result.  While it may seem an old, tired satire, this film treats it with such freshness and relevance.
Rob Marshall's experience in New York theatre lends itself well to the film.  His concept of vacillating between reality and the fantasy taking place in Roxie's mind solved the ever-persistent dilemma of so-called ""stagey"" musical numbers-present in several past movie musicals.  Almost all of the numbers take place onstage in a theatre somewhere in the recesses of Roxie's imagination, with the exception of ""All That Jazz"" (which appears as Velma's nightclub act) and another at the end of the film.  Both work well in reality and fit with Marshall's concept.
Rene Zellweger hits the spot as Roxie Hart, a wannabe chorus girl that murders her lying boyfriend Fred Casely.  While Zellweger is not the strongest singer/dancer (she had no prior vocal or dance experience before ""Chicago""), she acquits herself well enough.  It also gives a new dimension to the character, saying that maybe Roxie really doesn't have the real talent to be a real vaudeville star.  Catherine Zeta-Jones hoofs and belts her way through the role of Velma Kelly-an already established vaudeville star that commits double homicide on her sister and husband.  Zeta-Jones' smoldering, sexy performance of ""All That Jazz"" and the energetic ""I Can't Do It Alone"" are two great highlights!  Richard Gere combines charm and sleaze as defense attorney Billy Flynn, singing in three tough numbers, and proving himself as a tap-dancer.  Rapper Queen Latifah is a revelation as Matron Mama Morton.  Channeling Sophie Tucker, Latifah knocks your socks off in her rollicking (and quite ""busty"") rendition of ""When You're Good to Mama"" and is aggressive in her portrayal of a prison matron that believes in ""quid pro quo.""  In the role of Roxie's mechanic husband Amos, John C. Reilly sings his single number ""Mr. Cellophane"" with a sadness and brimming anger that breaks your heart.  Amos is the moral center in a story where the good guy is the loser, while all the corrupt people are the winners.
Other mention must be made for Christine Baranski in the re-vamped role of reporter Mary Sunshine, a clever sob-sister.  Director Marshall made smart, if brief, use of five female performers in the roles of accused murderesses in the Cook County Jail.  Among them is R&B singer Mya (credited here as Mya Harrison), Deidre Goodwin (a veteran of the Broadway revival of ""Chicago"") and ballerina Ekaterina Ctchelkanova.
For such a good film, I am disappointed to say that the DVD presentation is not up to snuff.  Besides the essential English audio and subtitles, what you get is a behind-the-scenes special, running commentary from the director and screenwriter Bill Condon, a deleted scene (with or without director/screenwriter commentary), Spanish subtitles, and a French Language track.
The behind-the-scenes special, while informative, gets plodding after about ten minutes.  The deleted scene, ""Class,"" is nice to have, but it is clear that the number wouldn't have worked in the final cut of the film-and Rob Marshall explains exactly why.  The film's commentary is quite insightful, anecdotal and worth listening to for an hour and forty minutes.  The Spanish subtitles, while advertised on the DVD packaging, don't seem to appear whenever selected.  A most amusing feature is the French Language track with dialogue AND songs dubbed by French actors and singers.  The last time I've found this was with ""The Sound of Music.""
While these features are satisfying, there was so much more that they could have included.  I can recall several specials on television in relation to this film, as well as special features that could be accessed online from users of the soundtrack recording.  A rumor has been circulating through the internet that a special edition 2-DVD set is to be released at a later date.  Even if it means shelling out more money, I hope this does happen and that it is an improvement over the lack of features for a film that was such a critical, awards and box-office success.
I give the film 5 stars, but the features only 3 stars, which averages out to 4 stars overall.  I recommend this DVD regardless of the lack of features.  It is still a great addition to musical theatre lovers as well as those who simply enjoyed the film.",1061942400,,5319,5.107390300230947

The extras on this DVD are fun.  Mind you, there aren't your typical deleted scenes, but finally being able to see the deleted song ""Class"" is worth it.  Plus, the short documentary on the making of the film was good fun.
This DVD is a must have for any good collection.",1061942400,,589,4.792079207920792

In a different review I had written for the CD to the movie, I remarked that I was quite surprised by Renee Zelwegger and Richard Gere.  I had no idea how talented they are!
The behind-the-scenes section is incredible!  I loved being able to see rehearsals and the secrets of how the play came to be.
True, it's very different to put a musical that is meant for the stage on to the screen, but this was definitely worth the buy.  I am a huge fan of musicals, and this one didn't disappoint me one bit.",1061942400,5,654,4.363636363636363

1475280,4,B00005JLSE,"I would say Chicago is a different type of musical. It does not revolve around love but hatred and deception which gives this movie it's distinctfulness. I did enjoy how they  incorporated the musical numbers in the movie. I feel that Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved her Oscar win, she did a fantastic job in this movie. Actually, I believe the movie deserved all the Oscars it won except Best Picture. It was definitely not the Best Picture of the year. The Oscar should have gone to either The Hours or The Pianist. I agree that Moulin Rouge! is a much better film and should have won last year's Oscar for Best Picture with Nicole Kidman as Best Actress (luckily she received the much deserved award playing as Virginia Woolf in The Hours), but things don't always work how you want them to. Overall this is a good film and not your typical musical, but if you're really looking for that musical experience, Moulin Rouge! is what you should watch.",1061769600,,948,4.642857142857143

The only bright spot of the movie is Rene Zellweger, truely a great performance (and I am not even a Zellweger fan) however, Richard Gere's performance is way over done.  He really needs to get some more acting lessions under his belt or perhaps it's due to a weak script.
I purchased the DVD expecting a lot more from a movie that won 6 Acadamy Awards including Best Picture and I am going to promptly sell this turkey back.

Let's be honest, after years of seeing Richard Gere in fairly nondescript movies I now had to accept he was a singer and a dancer too? Or Catherine Zita Jones - sings? And whilst not a passionate fan of musicals, I can say that I have certainly have enjoyed some of the old classics over the years.
All I can say is that when the movie had finished I felt like applauding, it was over too soon, it was very very good. So if musicals are your thing then you will not be ashamed to admit that this is in your collection.

1475333,4,B00005JLSE,"Within the movie, you can feel the Fosse stage charisma for what parts crave dancing / singing, and a few others, while other scenes do mix in well as movie made moments.
The characters are more than fine and dandy, carrying tunes with golden voices, attitude, and a lot of sweat. Zeta-Jones steals the show throughout as the woman of women in show buisness ""Velma Kelly"". Her vixen stares to the audience and her commanding strong voice (wow!) is showstopping ! But don't stop the show!
Renee Zellweger's voice almost equals Jones, her Roxie Hart becoming a yearner for the fame and attention of show buisness and the media. Even Hart's confused husband who can't make up his mind about his murdering wife (John C. Reiley) carries the favourite tune, 'Mr. Celophane' and makes it sound so vaudeville perfect. Also check out the beautiful Queen Latifah, making sure all of her little girls in the prison ward she runs stay in line, for a litte cash. Just call her 'Mama'. Man, can she sing !
Richard Gere is an above average singer and good tap dancer, but makes his best as a lawyer who never loses. My favourite moments is when our cool bandleader comes around. Taye Diggs always has his voice heard in any part/room/moment of the movie when a song is starting. His smooth voice, and smooth intro's of anyone and any song was neat to anticipate. The man!
Every environment/place/room was set to the tea for a flapper and jazz era story.

I've read over a few of the other reviews here and agree with many of them. I do not believe Chicago should have received the Oscar even though it is a fabulous movie (Moulin Rouge is the definite standout here although I am not going to get into a diatribe over the differences here.) However, again, this is a great movie and a credit to it's genre. The direction and editing are great, the music video feel is wonderful given today's audience penchant for this. The acting is fantastic...a true ensemble work. Having performed on stage in the role of Hunyak I have a special place in my heart for this show. My only disappointment in the movie itself is that the satire that is so prevalent in the stage production seems overwashed by the ""razzle-dazzle"" of the movie itself.
The only real comparison I will make to Moulin Rouge in regards to this is that the Moulin Rouge DVD was a dream come true. All the extras from the rehearsals to costumes to unedited dance numbers and different camera angles was a true gift to those of us who love to get into our movies. I'm disappointed that Chicago did not follow suit. While I am happy that the deleted scene of Class is here (although a version of the movie with it edited in vs. just a music video would have been preferable) I am highly disappointed at the overall DVD.

Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, and Gere were BORN for this movie......I've NEVER liked Zellweger in anything I've seen her in until I saw this.  John C.

Anyways, I won't go into plot details, there's no need to......but anyways, this movie is beautiful.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser, and for that reason, it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.  I'm tired of stuffy, boring movies (The English Patient, or Il Postino, anyone?

Exceptional work by Rob Marshall and the team at Miramax to bring this dream production to fruition.
And I would be remiss without adressing the assine review from Charlotte, NC.  This is NOT a glorification of murderess and their ultimate escape from justice.  Rather, it is an indictment of the ""trial by press"" of even our current age (Kobe Bryant, OJ, etc.) when we should be more aware of the opressive effect of the media.

My problem is very basic - for any show to appeal to me, it has to resonate at some level. Especially with a musical, there should be someone in it you can either identify with or would invite into your home. The only sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, but I'd invite him in just out of pity. All through the ""Razzle Dazzle"" number, all I could think of was Johnny Chochran - and no, I wouldn't invite him in either.
A good show about terrible people just isn't enough for me - and I remain totally underwhelmed by Renee Zellwegger.",1061683200,3,628,4.3760683760683765

And after seeing it, I had no desire to ever see it again or to hum any of the songs. It was imminently forgettable. This film seems to be more about showcasing the hidden musical/dancing talents of actors known solely for acting than about a plausible story. The wit is superficial at best, and the moral of the story is a real yawner (if you even think there is one). If this is supposed to be the movie that brings back musicals, I think I'll just rerun some of the old classics instead. I dunno, I always think the Oscar winner for best picture should be one that will stand the test of time, e.g. Casablanca, The Sting, etc. I really don't think this movie can do that. All that aside, kudos to the one real singing talent I did see: Queen Latifah's acting may have been a trifle wooden but on stage she stole the entire movie with the one song she had.

It has a stunning cast with all the principals turning in memorable performances. I have always liked Catherine Zeta-Jones but in ""Chicago"" she simply bowled me over with her tough sassy turn as Velma Kelly. Renee Zellwegger was a revelation as Roxie Hart. Who ever thought she could sing and dance like that? Richard Gere was wonderful as was Queen Latifah and John C Reilly who I also never knew could sing. His rendition of ""Mr Cellophane"" is heartbreaking. Kudos to Rob Marshall for the superb direction. For those who are comparing this with ""Moulin Rouge"", don't. They are two different types of musicals and both are brilliant in their own way.

1475461,5,B00005JLSE,"At last, it's good to see a movie that really deserves an Academy Award.  This wonderful production combines the talents of a myriad of fantastic performers.  Veteran actors sing and dance as if they've been doing it all their lives and slick and creative musical numbers follow one another at a dizzying pace.
Renee Zellweger stars as a young girl desperate to be in show business.  She has an affair with a man who claims that he can help her career, but when he reveals that it's all a lie, she shoots him.  She ends up in jail with one of her idols, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, but Jones won't give her the time of day.  They are both accused of murder and they both use a slick-talking lawyer played to perfection by Richard Gere.  He manipulates the press by presenting Zellweger as a victim of the crime she committed and suddenly she has the fame she so greatly desires.  Now it's Zeta-Jones who comes to her and wants them to perform together, but Zellweger spurns her as earlier she has been rejected.  Each major character gets to shine in at least one solo number and both Queen Latifah and John C. Quinn deliver a show-stopping performance in ""Be Good to Momma"" and ""Cellophane Man"", respectively.  This is a highly entertaining film, and it contains some themes which are brilliantly satirized.  The power of the press and the unfairness of the legal system are brutally spotlighted and one can only assume at the end of this film that being bad is good.  This is a wonderful film and is highly recommended.",1061510400,,1525,4.590405904059041

1475463,4,B00005JLSE,"As a dancer since three and aspiring Broadway performer, I was excited to hear that Chicago was going to finally be made into a movie.  Having seen the Broadway revival, I had high expectations for this film.  I was expecting Fosse choreography or at least Fosse inspired choreography.  I got Rob Marshall (who is a choreographer) and loved it.  Completely going away from Fosse choreography was an ingenious idea.  The casting of Zeta-Jones was inspired.  She started out doing Broadway in England and it is obvious.  All you need to see is ""All That Jazz"" and ""I Can't Do It Alone"" to prove that she deserved the Oscar.  People are being hard on Zellwegger.  Remember this though, Roxie is an aspiring Vaudeville performer and not that great.  Yes, in the movie she is picturing all these performances in her head but the certain roughness in her dancing and singing is to be expected.  It adds the charm.  Gere was in Grease on Broadway in the 70s and while it has been a long time coming, he did wonderfully.  His three months work on the tap dance was obvious.  John C. Reilly gave a wonderful performance in Mr. Cellophane.  As for the critics wondering why Lucy Liu and others are in there, it's because everyone wanted to be involved in this project.  The best was Chita Rivera's bit part.  So unexpected.  As for the people who bash Chicago because of Moulin Rouge, get over it.  The two are different ideas.  Both musicals, but if everything looked the same, it would be boring.  Moulin Rouge was shot with interesting camera angles to add to the whimsy of the movie.  Chicago was shot to best show the choreography.  And Nicole Kidman is not a better singer than Zellwegger or Zeta-Jones.  Her voice is too thin.  And I also own Moulin Rouge and love it.  Just don't ask me to pick which is my favorite.",1061510400,,1814,4.573208722741433

Reilly, Taye Diggs, Colm Feore, and all of the dancers.  Rob Marshall just illuminates your home with his skillful rendering of Bob Fosse's Kander and Ebb musical.

1475465,5,B00005JLSE,"It's a been a long time since a Broadway musical rocked the attention of the film-going public in its celluloid version.  Indeed, the last such musical to win Best Picture at the Oscars was the classic OLIVER! in 1968.  While films like EVITA and GREASE made noble efforts in the following years, the Broadway musical genre seemed destined to be a faded memory.  Then came the success of 2001's MOULIN ROUGE which, although not based on a Broadway show, showed that inventive and well-done musicals can draw an appreciative audience.  In 2002, CHICAGO built on that momentum and brought the genre back into blazing life, while winning 6 Oscars in the process....including Best Picture. This clever, cynical satire tells the 1920's story of Roxie Hart, a young married woman who shoots her lover dead when he fails to promote her entertainment career.  In the Cook County Jail, she meets with other female killers including jazzy dance star, Velma Kelly.  Hart and Kelly soon find themselves competing for publicity, status, and even their hot-shot lawyer, Billy Flynn.
As the somewhat innocent, yet ruthless Roxie Hart, Renee Zellweger does a wonderful job in balancing her two conflicting sides, while creating a character that grabs our interest.  Richard Gere is also top-notch as the slick lawyer Billy Flynn. It's a fun character-type role that easily grabs our attention.  John C. Reilly is winning as the meekish, put-upon husband to Roxie. Queen Latifah wonderfully underplays her role as the prison matron. And there's the definitive performance of Catherine Zeta-Jones as the sexy and sly Velma Kelly.  With her high energy, strong voice and wonderful dancing, Zeta-Jones creates a film performance that is as definitive in its own way as Ron Moody's Fagin in OLIVER! or Julie Andrew's Maria in SOUND OF MUSIC. She richly deserved the Oscar she won for Best Supporting Actress.  Rob Marshall directs this flick with a sure hand, and with a fast pace and style that makes the film seem much shorter than it actually is.
The DVD is pretty basic for the most part with a ""Making of"" featurette, a director/screenwriter commentary, as well as the deleted number, ""Class,"" which featured Zeta-Jones and Latifah.
In the end, CHICAGO is that rare bird: a film musical that remains true to the original, while maintaining its own integrity.  Like OLIVER!, SOUND OF MUSIC, and MY FAIR LADY, it deserves to stand the test of time as one of the great film recreations of Broadway, and it is definitely worth your time.",1061424000,,2517,4.969047619047619

It is simply deserving of being the 75th Oscar Best Picture! The performances cannot be more brilliant.  Before its completion, I raised an eyebrow upon learning that Renee Zellweger was playing Roxie Hart.  Having seen remarkable performances on the Broadway stage, I doubted that Renee can do justice to the role.  Boy was I wrong!  Renee turned in a tour de force performance! She is Roxie Hart.

It's lone saving grace was Renee Zellweger who was fun to watch and made me laugh several times. This movie is worth seeing but i don't think I would want to own it. The disc itself looks good and the sound is great but for a Best Picture winner I expected more than the single disc version given here, I think we will be seeing a 2 disk Special Edition soon so if you must have this film on dvd go ahead and get this one but don't be surprised when a better version shows up in 4-6 months.",1061424000,,784,4.117647058823529

The DVD includes a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, which clocks in at about 28 minutes.  The special concludes with a music video for ""All That Jazz"".  Strangely and fortunately, these two features are different than the special and video that came with the soundtrack DVD.  Miramax has also been so kind as to bless us with a multitude of trailers for somewhat random items.  And let us not forget the musical number, ""Class"", which is more of a dissapointment than I expected.  The audio commentary on the film is quite interesting, though, there is something missing.
In fact, there is a lot missing on the Chicago DVD.  This very easily could have been a two-disc set, though Miramax decided to take the easy-way out and provide ""enough"" extras.  There was a music video for Anastacia's ""Love is a Crime"" track, which is on the Chicago soundtrack, and is missing from the DVD.  Clips from the Broadway play (or at least a more extensive section on how the story was conceptualized into a play).  It would have been nice to have seen a homage or documentary on Bob Fosse.

These clips are lost in the Miramax studios, unless they decide to release a ""Collector's Edition"" of some sorts.

The movie version upholds to its Broadway prdecessors...It's an amazing story of two infamous women (Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, Zeta-Jones and Zellweger, respectively) fighting for media publicity and lawayer played wonderfully by Richard Gere (who does his own tap dancing and singing). With musical numbers written brilliantly by John Kander and Frank Ebb that will have your feet tapping in tempo and lyrics that stay in your head, who wouldn't love this musical?! Not too mention choreography inspired by Bob Fosse - you can NOT get any better than Kander&Ebb with Fosse!! ""The Cell Block Tango"" in itself is totally worth it, as is John C Reily's absolutely amazing ""Mr. Cellophane""
For all those people out there who getting the wrong advice about Moulin Rouge being ""sooooo much better"" than Chicago, please do not listen. I am a huge musical fan, having performed in several musicals and attending 5 times more at local, regional and broadway theatre, I can safely say that Chicago is far superior to anything that Baz Lurhman may give you. This is not to say that Moulin Rouge was not a great musical - Ewan McGregor was absoultey phenomenal. Kidman, however, is in no comparison whatsoever to Zeta-Jones or Zelleweger (who may not have the greatest sing-songy or trained voice like zeta-jones, but for its character purposes, it is the PERFECT Roxie voice) At least, Zelleweger looked like she had the breathe support and technique to sing, and can belt out some impressive notes for a first time singer. Kidman, though pretty, is nothing special and thousands upon thousands of girls can sing just like here.
Not too mention the story is chicago is actually worth talking and thinking about, compared to the weak and cliched storyline of moulin rouge (you know what's going to happen in the end within the first 10 minutes of the movie - where is the fun in that?!)
So please, forget all the awful rumors and stupid advice about Moulin Rouge being the ""superior musical"" b/c they all obvisouly do not know what they are talking about!

With much anticipation I awaited August 19th to see the DVD unveiled for this 6-Oscar Winning film.  What I found when I put the DVD in my player was nothing short of an eh, so-so effort.  Unlike last years Moulin Rouge DVD or the Harry Potter DVDs, which include two discs, many bonus features, and a ton of other bells and whistles, the Chicago DVD does not even come with nice liner notes! All it has is a sheet of paper with the chapter titles. Believe it or not, the ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" DVD has better liner notes than Chicago's! This DVD's special features are limited - one of them being a ""behind the scenes"" featurette that has already aired on the Internet months ago.  It seems to me that someone took the easy way out in creating this very limited DVD.  As I stated earlier, the movie is fabulous and it deserves a far better DVD than was produced.  Perhaps the creators of the DVD should take note from a film like Moulin Rouge and give its audience the special features, time, and creativity it deserves.  So in closing, the movie gets a 5, the DVD itself gets a 2.  If you like the movie, go out and buy the DVD - you can expect to be blown away by the film and it's talent.  However, you can also expect to be disappointed at the DVD's lack of ingenuity, effort, and creativity,  which this movie truly deserved more of.",1061337600,,1456,4.2773722627737225

I play the soundtrack CD all the time, and now I can play individual numbers at my whim!  Renee Zellweger, of whom I am no fan, does an excellent job as Roxie Hart, and her singing voice is appropriate for a character who is not supposed to be exceptionally talented anyway.  Richard Gere was completely robbed at the Academy Awards: His Billy Flynn is a sleazy, smarmy antihero for whom we cheer, and he does an excellent job with his singing and dancing, adopting a Jolson-esque singing style very appropriate to the time period.  Queen Latifah proves quite an actress in the non-singing parts, and her solo number is a hoot.  But the real reason to see Chicago is Catherine Zeta Jones.  She is a real hoofer with a great voice to match!  If this had been her debut, it would really have been one of those legendary star-making parts!  (I have started going back to see her past work, and I highly recommend her work in Entrapment with Sean Connery; she's sexy and fab in that tricky little thriller, too.)  The deleted musical number Class is clever, but obviously could not have taken place in this version of the story because Roxie is not present (all the music is in her imagination) and thus was rightly cut. Finally, if you can sit through the Cell-Block Tango number without wanted to applaud afterword, you are hard-hearted indeed!",1061337600,,1537,4.6007326007326

The particular scene in which Roxie (Zellweger) shoots Fred is so well acted that I wanted to shoot him too...that jerk!  Zellweger delivers a stellar performance as dreamer Roxie.  Her seeming innocence is acted out well, and perfectly suited for ""oh so naive"" looking Renee.  She gives her best performance though when she is singing ""Nowadays"".  We all knew she could act, but who knew she could sing?
Queen Latifa as ""Momma"" had one of the best songs in the whole musical with ""When your good to Momma"".  And boy can she belt it!! Richard Gere was made for Broadway and it shows as he ""tap dances"" around the issues, but he does his best as a ventriliquist (however you spell it) in ""We both reached for the Gun"".

1475553,3,B00005JLSE,"""Chicago"" is the Academy Award winning musical from 2002 that brought back the genre in elegant style.  Set during the rum running twenties, the plot loosely follows to murderesses (Catherine Zeta Jones-Douglas and Rene Zellweger) who are awaiting their fate on death row.  Enter the over confident lawyer (Richard Gere)who promises to make it all better.  Electrifying musical numbers rock this rather flat story and bump up the action a well deserved notch - but was this really the Best Picture of 2002?!?!
Mirimax's DVD won't be winning any awards.  Colors are well balanced but flesh tones are overly pinkish and flat.  Fine details are lost in the darker scenes, even when viewing the movie in a completely blackened room.  Edge enhancement and aliasing crop up now and then, though nothing that will terribly distract.  Film grain is a real problem - certain scenes are smooth as silk while others look as though they are at least twenty years old. (Herein I am not making references to the stylistic aged look employed during certain segments of the movie but various shots within a particular scene that veer wildly between generally smooth to excessively grainy.  Check out Zeta Jone's ""All That Jazz"" number that opens the film. When Rene Zellweger intrudes with her own bar and chorus, the background information in the shot is suddenly riddled with grit, grain and a digital harshness.)  Not a terrible mastering effort - just not an exemplary one and for a BEST PICTURE WINNER of one year vintage, entirely unacceptable.  The audio is 5.1 and DTS but neither are particularly distinguished though both offer an aggressive bass and some kick during the musical numbers.
EXTRAS:A deleted song, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.
BOTTOM LINE: I would have at least expected a ""making of"" for this movie but I suppose Miramax is holding that back for a special ""deluxe"" edition sure to be out before Christmas.  This is a very disappointing over all marketing of a BEST PICTURE - especially one that garnered tons of critical attention and a host of awards!",1061251200,,2073,4.96242774566474
1475554,5,B00005JLSE,"It seems only fitting that in these bleak times, the musical would once again rise to popularity, and take Hollywood's most coveted award.  Musicals had their golden age in the 20's and 30's, in times of moral depravity, alcoholism, economic hardship, and less-than-stellar presidents.  Sound familiar?  Musicals were meant to take the audience to another world, a world of glitz and glamour, but more importantly happiness, romance, and hope.
This time around, it's a little different.  Gone is the naivete that was once so abundant in musicals, having been replaced with morally bankrupt characters who care only about themselves and their freedom, fame, and fortune.  The only exception here is Amos Hart, the only decent man to be found in the whole thing.  I wish I could say things work out for him, but, who am I kidding?
For the world of Chicago, unlike so many musicals, is not the place where the glitz, glamour, and music take place.  No, the world of Chicago is the world of the selfish, flash-in-the-pan stardom of the real Chicago in the 1920's.  Only the opening number, ""All That Jazz"", and the final number, ""Nowadays"", take place in the real world - all the glitz and glamour in between is in Roxie's deluded head.  And, in many ways, this Chicago is very realistic.  There were really such things as ""Jazz Killers"", women who shot their husbands for various reasons; mainly to get on the front page.
So why five stars?  One reviewer gave one star for precisely the reasons I listed above.  Yes, these are reprehensible people (with the exception of Amos), so why watch?  To name but a few reasons, this is an entertaining movie with fantastic singing (Bob Fosse was a genius), stellar choreography and directing, and some of the best acting of the last year - (Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved it, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Richard Gere were robbed (at least the former was nominated.)).  But besides all that, a friend of mine put it best when she said: ""it's like a train wreck - it's disgusting and disturbing, but you just can't look away.""
Chicago indeed has that quality, and against our better judgement, we can't help but like the characters.  It is a great musical, and even those who for one reason or another may steer clear of this genre should give it a chance - it's not your typical musical.  Instead of whisking us off to a magical land where everything turns out alright, it whisks us back to the Roaring Twenties, where, as my same friend put it: ""you just had to keep dancing and drinking, because if you stopped, you just might realize how bad things really were.""",1061251200,,2602,4.748888888888889

1475669,5,B00005JLSE,"I walked into ""Chicago"" not knowing a thing about it. I am a fan of musicals but that certainly does NOT mean they can't be ruined in a movie.
Having said that..
Renee Zellweger was outstanding in this movie and it is a CRIME that she did not recieve the Oscar! She dances, sings and acts like a pro to the point that you believe she IS Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones who DID win an Oscar(she deserved it the most), was sexy and humorous in the movie and the fact that she can sing and dance like a broadyway actress helps as well! Richard Gene is fantastic as a silver-tounged lawyer and the supporting cast includes a wheeling and dealing Queen Latifah, a cellophane-like man: John C. Reily and a ""Sob Sister"" role for Christine Baranski.
  Set in the jazzy 1920's, the story opens with ""All that Jazz"" proving that it revolves around Roxie Hart(Zellwegger) who wants more than anything to be a vaudville star. When the man she is cheating on her husband with walks out on her with the words ""You're a two-bit talent with skinny legs-face it Roxie, you ain't never gonna have an act!"", Zellweger's character shoots him dead. When her ""Funny Honey"" Amos arrives home, he is prepared to take the blame-'till he discovers what Fred Casley and his Roxie were doing every night. Roxie is shipped off to jail, were famous vaudville legend Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) is imprisoned for the same crime. Matron ""Mama"" Morton promises Roxie to help her for a price in ""When Your Good to Mama"". Enter Billy Flynn the best criminal lawyer in all of Chicago, ""All I Care About"". One of his best lines is: ""I don't mean to toot my own horn but if Jesus Christ had lived in Chicago and had $5000, things would have turned out differently."" Flynn is also Velma's lawyer and Velma isn't to happy about him taking Roxie's case. Within a week ROXIE ROCKS CHICAGO is the headline and everyone, including reporter Mary Sunshine (Baranski) believes that Roxie and Casley ""both reached for the gun"" The name on everyone's lips is ""Roxie"". Velma tries to gain Roxies trust by offering to do an act with her in ""I can't do it alone"". But the now extremely arrogant Roxie says no. Roxie announces her pregnancy but Amos realises that he isn't the father! He also realises how pathetic and sad his life is in ""Mister Cellophane."" Roxie turns on the old ""Razzle Dazzle"" during her trial-and is found absolutally NOT GUILTY! However-no one wants to take her picture, but after all-that's Chicago! Then out of the blue-something amazing happens: Velma and Roxie are in a show TOGETHER and have one back all that was lost!
  This movie will appeal to everyone in some way. The camerawork is unique and the setting really looks like the 1920s. The dancing is the best-the singing is great-the script couldn't be better-GO SEE IT. END OF STORY!",1060905600,,2812,4.629258517034068
1475670,4,B00005JLSE,"I just seen the Chicago DVD (Widescreen Edition) and though I would give the film on this DVD 5 stars (especially for having the DTS sound option along with Dolby Digital), I would give the ""Special Features"" section of this DVD only 3 stars because the ""Special Features"" section is poorly lacking compared to past Miramax DVDs like The Cider House Rules. Miramax could have included other extras such as the original theatrical trailer, all the TV spots (and there were many of them) plus all of the music videos (though the music video, ""And All That Jazz"" was shown at the end of the featurette, they could have also included the other 2 music videos, ""Cell Block Tango (He Had It Comin')"" from Queen Latifah and Lil' Kim featuring Macy Gray plus ""Love is a Crime"" from Anastacia). I assume that Miramax will add most if not all these features in a special collector's edition DVD in the future as part of their ""Miramax Collector's Series"" collection.

I had never seen Chicagoon broadway  so I wasn't sure what I was going to see. All I knew is that it had gotten GREAT reviews and the trailer looked pretty cool. I came out of the theater very pleased and humming Nowadays. I saw it three more times and everytime I seem to enjoy it more and I cannot wait until August 19! I have become so obsessed with this movie, I bought the movie book and the soundtrack which I listen to almost everyday. I just cant get enough of it. If you are the kind of person that is very uptight about morals this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you let yourself loose then you won't have a problem with it. Most of you who haven't seen it probably think it is a drama, it's actually more of a comedy. A dark comedy mind you. Cell Block Tango and We Both Reached For The Gun and a few other songs  are supposed to make you laugh. The cast is amazing, Renee can sing. No, shes not the best but did you expect that  every good actress to be able to sing perfect too? Catherine is awesome and is easily my favorite actress, she charecter is my favorite too. Velma is bold and sarcastic and isn't afraid to tell you what she thinks of you. Queen Latifah was so comical! Dying her hair blonde, that was hilarious, I was giggling through that whole entire scene. John C Riely is good, but through the whole movie I kept thinking ""A[...] Amos"" Richard Gere was also surprisingly good, as was his is singing.

1475672,5,B00005JLSE,"The advent of the stage musical was driven by a young American society seeking an English speaking opera which could combine the talents of American Jazz, the celebration of the American spirit, and provide a hopeful look at life. This was even more evident during the depression. During the 60's and 70's the musical took on different life forms. The ideals that theatre was a vehicle of social awareness did not limit the genre to only three act dramas guaranteed to make us angry. The musical saw this through an enormous success of ""Hair"". Then we saw ""A Chorus Line"", ""Sweeny Todd"",""Cabaret"" and a string of shows with a sociological edge to them. When ""Chicago"" opened it was met with mixed reviews, and did not really enjoy its deserved recognition until it's Broadway revival in the 1990's.
""Chicago"" was not meant to celebrate killers, or adultery, or crooked lawyers. That is not the point. ""Chicago"" takes a look at
the society that was overlooked in the early part of the century. The mobsters, the crime, and the fact that we let killers manipulate the press and become heroes. This is a story of just how [mentally challenged] people can be, and how enamored they can become by sensational stories. Even based on truth that become distorted. I would imagine that a musical about OJ Simpson and Scott Peterson would be a more modern take.
The execution of the story with its fast paced attention to detail makes this a film. The way that the producers stayed true to the score makes this a surprise.
So, people who see this film as a movie celebrating killers really miss the boat. This film is all about how our society is more interested in how the press makes killers into famous people. That is the core, and that is the idea everyone should remember. If we could send a message to the press that we do not want Scott Peterson to have any press time at all, things in this country would get a bit better. Thanks ""Chicago"" for reminding us of that.",1060819200,,1964,4.614285714285714

I've read comparisons between Chicago and Moulin Rouge, but believe me - there is no comparison.  Where Moulin Rouge had a sappy plot buried somewhere among the flashy morass, Chicago's musical numbers tie the storyline together in a clever, coherent fashion.  The droll dialog (an announcer intones ""Miss Velma Kelley, in a act - of desperation!"") and tongue-in-cheek numbers (Richard Gere is a tapdancing laywer - both literally and figuratively) all add up to one very innovative movie.

Fortunately, this is NOT what Chicago is about!  This is not a historical look at the 1920's jaded by this century's ""immorality"".  This movie is based on a 1975 Broadway Musical about media influence and the circus that the American public allows itself to be caught up in.  Funny that this is still so very very true 28 years later.
I loved the Broadway version of this story featuring Bebe Neworth and Ann Ranking, and I did like the movie version as well.  Are they the same?  Of course not silly.  Are they both enjoyable?  Absolutely!
If you have no sense of irony and cannot see past the surface of movies, then you will probably not enjoy this film.  You must also practice the all-important willfull suspension of disbelief that makes movie magic successful.  There are shifts between reality and fantasy worlds in this film.  They are not handed to you on a silver platter, you must actual THINK for yourself during this film.  Imagine that.  You must also think for yourself and decide what this film is truly trying to say.
Katherine Zeta Jones's training in Stage Musicals is evident in this film, as is Richard Gere's.  Rene Zellweger makes a remarkable first effort.  One thing that makes movie musicals so difficult to pull off is the different demand for voice talent between the two (stage and screen musicals).  If you had performers who were only familiar with stage acting do this film, it would be ridiculous.  They would seem to overact and over sing.  the audience is far away from the stage, but right in front of the story on film.  The effect is very different for each genre.
My only qualm about this movie is the removal of the Fosse choreography.  It adds such an interesting touch to the story (even if it was accidental and a mockery of the late choreographer's disabiltiy).  Inclusion of more of the original dance numbers would have made this a perfect 5 for me.
I believe this film, and all involved deserved Oscars.  If you think Gangs of New York should have won, check your history books!  The historical inaccuracies are mortifying!",1060732800,2,2117,4.677506775067751

1475676,3,B00005JLSE,"I saw ""Chicago"" on stage a few years ago and I can say this movie is basically the stage show on camera minus the live show's energy. The actors clearly had a blast making this movie. Unfortunately that doesn't make a good movie.
Renee Zelweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are both great singers, although Zeta-Jones is clearly more talented in both singing and dancing. Richard Gere's singing voice is nearly unlistenable in my opinion. It was all I could do not to leave the theatre when I first heard it.
The biggest problem with this film is the story. It was never the best Broadway musical out there; the songs are forgettable and the story is filled with unlikable characters that the audience doesn't care about.
The comparisons to ""Moulin Rouge"" are inevitable, but as far as a movie that features a memorable story and songs, it is clearly superior to ""Chicago"". ""Moulin Rouge"" opened the doors for musicals in 2001 and was basically ignored by the Academy. ""Chicago"" rolls out a year later and sweeps the Oscars. ""Moulin Rouge"" is definitely the more inventive of the two (and in my opinion, the better).

1475854,5,B00005JLSE,"Be sure to strap yourself as you enter the sexy, wild world of ""Chicago,"" the 2003 Academy Award winner for Best Picture.  The story centers around a young wannabe starlet named Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger).  She has an affair with a man who promises her a ticket to stardom.  When she finds out he was dishonest with her, she shoots him out of rage.  She soon lands in jail with the prospect of being executed.
Enter Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a glory-hungry lawyer who has never rendered a guilty verdict.  He helps reshape Roxie's image and starts her on the path she's always dreamed of: one to public adoration and popularity.  Complicating things is Velma Kelly, another dancing murderess played deliciously by Catherine Zeta-Jones.  The two, both represented by Billy, compete for his attention and the biggest stories in the papers.
What follows is a circus of greed, sexuality, sensationalism, and secrets, all coupled with bright lights, powerful songs, and bold dance numbers.  ""Chicago"" offers us all a peek into this secret world of the jazzy but corrupt roaring 20's, much like Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"" clued us in on turn-of-the-century Paris.
Much in the style of Luhrman, director Rob Marshall employs a very quick camera style.  This adds an element of dizziness as the characters witness their world being turned upside down.  It makes the dance numbers appear more sharp and more in-your-face.
Only one word can describe the cast: FLAWLESS!  Zellweger perfectly captures the very naive quality of every young girl who wants to be an actress or a singer.  Zeta-Jones, an incredible singer and dancer, lights up every stage she's on and every scene she's in.  Gere is surprising as slimy Billy Flynn, delivering vibrant songs and outrageous courtroom dramatics.  Queen Latifah was fantastic as Mama Morton.  Her solo was one of the spiciest moments in the film!  Finally, there is John C. Reilly as Roxie's dim-witted but faithful husband Amos.  He is the most honest and good-natured character in the whole film.

This movie is clearly not promoting murder and other immoral behaviors.  It is a fun poke at the extremes to which some people will go for their five minutes of fame.  Richard Gere's character and the courtroom scene are hilarious parodies of the American legal system.
As for the movie itself, I think it suffers from the ""My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding"" syndrome--a good movie that could not possibly live up to the enormous hype.  Definitely worth seeing, though.",1060300800,,587,4.7254901960784315
1475856,3,B00005JLSE,"Ok, so I went to see Chicago with the highest expectations. Everyone was telling me that it was the best musical and that it was better than Moulin Rouge (which I love) so I was expecting something mind boggling. Sorry to say, the movie didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe it was because I had such BIG expectations.
Don't get me wrong. I wasn't that I didn't enjoy it. I thought it was entertaining and I simply LOVED the music, in fact I bought the soundtrack. I enjoyed the humor and satire and it was a feel good movie. But I had a lot of problems with the movie and I didn't think that it was the best movie of the year.
I liked Zeta-Jones. Queen Latifah was hilarious and I love John C. Reilly. (HAve you noticed that he plays the exact same role in the Hours, Chicago and The Good Girl? Nice, kind, husband with suffering/unfulfilled wives?) I personally do not like Richard Gere and am thus prejudiced (At leat I admit it). He dances rather well (specially that one tap scene during the trial), but i just couldn't stand his voice. There was just something about it that sounded so childish. His voice didn't seem matured or developed. Catherine Zeta-Jones, though, can really dish it out. I love her voice. But Renee Zellweger? She just couldn't compete with Zeta-Jones. Zeta-Jones has this really rich, gorgeous voice and she just commands those dance numbers. Zellweger sounded like a high-pitched screech owl in comparison. Ok, so maybe I'm being a little harsh on Zellweger, but seriously, if your going to make a musical, give the lead to an actress that actually can sing or has experience for God's sake! She's really the reason why I couldn't enjoy this film.
And it just seemed so calculated. Chicago certainly ""razzle dazzles"" us with all the visual elements of Moulin Rouge (the bright lights and ostentatious, over-the-top costumes) and showcases a very popular cast, but the thing is, Chicago the movie is more about SHOW than SUBSTANCE. Why else would they hire Zellweger when they could probably have found a better qualified actress to play Roxie? Because Zellweger is a big name actress, fresh from her Oscar nomination in Bridgit Jones. Why Why else is Lucy Liu in this film for all of 2 minutes? Mya for like 5? Because this movie was all SHOW. It was as if the studio execs said ""Hmm....in order to make our movie as popular as possible, let's gather up every big named actor we can think of...forget TALENT""

I guess what I have to say is really best described by Billy Flynn, ""Give 'em the old razzle dazzle/Razzle Dazzle 'em/Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it
And the reaction will be passionate/Give 'em the old hocus pocus
Bead and feather 'em/How can they see with sequins in their eyes?
...Long as you keep 'em way off balance/How can they spot you got no talents?/Razzle dazzle 'em/And they'll make you a star!""
So, yes, I was entertained by all the ""razzle"" and ""dazzle"". I though Zeta-Jones was excellent. I liked the songs for the most part, yet I still came home dissapointed because, once again, it was all about show instead of substance.",1060128000,4,3092,4.611615245009075

Moulin Rouge runs the gamut of emotions, and it really pushes the envelope a lot more than Chicago does. Chicago is pretty much just a big Bob Fosse tribute (which is fine... I love Bob Fosse! But he made such a mark, he's no longer ""original""). Anyway, I think it is possible to like BOTH movies. Chicago is a lot of fun!
The extras on the DVD are good -- I learned a lot about the history of the source material on the Making Of Featurette, and I liked seeing the 'Class' number, which was cut from the feature release. I strongly recommend the widescreen version as opposed to the fullscreen. Fullscreen cuts off so much of those beautiful visuals -- I can't believe they would even release it that way, all visually chopped up.",1060041600,21,1023,4.446808510638298

1475859,5,B00005JLSE,"I would reccomend this movie to anyone. Even people who generally hate musicals would like this one, because its not like some guy is walking down the street and suddenly bursts into dance and song and magically everyone else suddenly knows the dance moves. It all takes place in the mind of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) the main charecter, a person who is obsessed with fame so it makes sense that she would dream all this up. It all starts when the vaudville singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones) kills her husband and sister, she rushes to the Onyx theater because she has to preform. So as shes singing All That Jazz you see Roxie Hart watching her every move because she herself wants to be just like Velma. She leaves with the man that she is having an affair with, because he promises her he can get her an act. When Roxie finally discovers that her lover is a phony and liar she shoots him. Roxie tries to get herself out of what she has done by making  her husband tell the police  that the guy was a burglar. But as always the police find out the truth and arrest Roxie for murder. At the Cook County jail she meets up with Matron ""Mama"" Morton, Billy Flynn a smooth talking lawyer, and Velma Kelly her idol. She hires Billy and starts stealing Velmas head lines and I have to stop there because I might say too much if I go on. I've heard that they wanted Goldie Hawn,Nicole Kidman Gwyneth Paltrow, and Cameron Diaz for the role of Roxie. Goldie Hawn is much to perky, and to old (sorry Goldie) Nicole Kidman is to tall an to elegant to take on a role like this, as for the other two I could never see them as Roxie. For Velma Kelly they considered Madonna who couldve done ok but Catherine WAS Velma Kelly and NO ONE couldve done better. They considered Kathy Bates & Rosie O'Donnel for Mama, Kathy Bates wouldve been ok but Rosie O'Donnell is just to ....... well Rosie! :)  Anyways the cast is awesome, so I could never see anyone else in their roles.

'Chicago' was actually written decades ago, and this movie (as well as the version currently on Broadway) is technically actually a revival. The entire musical, while fun with great music and dancing, has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek and is really about America's fascination with the rich, glam and famous and also the fickle power of clebrity and the ""here today, gone tomorrow"" phonemoea of Hollywood and the American media. But it sure is a fun fable! And while all of the actors are wonderful, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere dance away with the movie!

1475861,5,B00005JLSE,"This was one of the best movies to come out last year, and it was a stunning film adaptation of a great musical.  CHICAGO was a Kander/Ebb affair which Bob Fosse choreographed in its original incarnation on the Broadway stage back in the 1970s. This was the team behind CABARET, and they were ushering in a new more thought-provoking form of musical theatre with deep themes about unsavory subjects - here female inmates on death row who hunger more for fame than virtue.  But all of it was done with a glee and aw shucks charm!
The movie does not disappoint fans of the show - it stays true to the themes and style of the show.  Some songs are cut, and the book is slightly altered - the biggest change is the real world setting which places most all of the musical numbers inside the characters imaginations.  The songs are inner monologues of how they wished the world was contrasted starkly with the prison/court room setting of the more gritty real world.  The style of the entire film comes from the 70s, and is very reminiscent of Bob Fosse's highly praised adaptation of CABARET into a successful film.  It's a piece of art - it apes the style of CABARET so don't expect MOULIN ROUGE.  No quick edits or way over the top orchestrations or even sets.  This is sexy and streamlined!
The cast is top-notch.  Catherine Zeta Jones is amazingly well-suited for this kind of production!  So is Queen Latifah and Richard Gere.  Renee Zellweger is right out of the period, and sings very well!  It's all an homage to old school hoofing and singing.  Wonderful!  You can't go wrong.
DVD includes a cut song called CLASS with Zeta Jones and Latifah, as well as featurettes and a director's commentary!  Should be the top drawer DVD for 2003!",1059609600,9,1738,4.561290322580645
1475862,4,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is such a great show...the cynicism seems so much like that of our age that it's hard to believe that it is based on a 1975 musical, which is based on a 1920's play, which is in turn based on REALITY.  (The playwright was a former newspaper reporter, who turned her experiences covering sensational murder trials into a hit play back in the 20's.)
That the plot seems so very up-to-date 80 years after it was originally penned I think goes to the fact that the musical truly captures a part (and just a part) of human nature and portrays it with such gleeful abandon that you can't help but join in the fun.
By the way, they cut one of the best songs in the play (""Class""), which I assume will end up in the DVD, since I read that it was filmed.  Also, the movie version of Cellblock Tango doesn't even hold a CANDLE to the stage version.  But still, a great revival of the movie musical!",1059523200,,896,4.258823529411765
1475942,5,B00005JLSE,"I have never entered a review of a movie here before, especially when the DVD hasn't been released. But after reading two diatribe on this movie, I simply had to. It appears that the two reviewers who simply hated this movie, hated it for the wrong reason. One was practically a commercial for Moulin Rouge (which I also liked), while the other (Daniel Wahl) was a rant against the IDEA of the movie, rather than the movie itself. The fact that he didn't see the cynicism that was apparent within this movie meant he didn't get it! Wait till he finds out that the stage version has been out since the early 70's (the revival is still playing to full houses on Broadway and on the road). He'll whine about that too.
Both of them missed the reason you write one of these things: HOW IS THE ACTUAL MOVIE? It is a damn good one, and very entertaining. I went with a bunch of people who were ready to hate the movie, especially since they have never liked musicals in general, both in movies and at the theaters. We all came out smiling and ready to buy the DVD the day it comes out. Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere - who knew they could sing? Catherine Zeta Jones, to me, was the real star, handling some of the most demanding dance and singing sequence.
But all these are superimposed on the backdrop of the cynicism of the story. One would find it rather uncanny when viewed through what happened with the O.J. Simpson trial (Did Johnny Cochran learned all the tricks from Billy Flynt?). I would even equate the cynicism seen in Chicago as that presented in the movie Brazil (with the original director's ending).",1059523200,9,1612,4.467796610169492
1475943,5,B00005JLSE,"Ok...Chicago is about murder,greed,violence,adultery,fame,and treachery. The plot is simple, two women murder thier lovers and get away with it. But it is so much more than that. Moulin Rouge, despite having no original songs, was barely a musical. Sure there were songs, but very little dancing. Nicole Kidman is a good singer but lets face it Catherine Zeta Jones can really belt it out. Renee Zellweger(love her)also has a lovely voice, it wasn't the greatest but you must remember that she has never done anything like this before. Her voice was actually perfect for the role. Roxie is supposed to be the junior singer, the one who has less experience. The music is great too! It was all written by Kander and Ebb(also wrote music for Cabaret,Kiss of The Spider Women, Steel Pier, The Act, Zorba, etc.) Bob Fosse wanted to make Chicago into a movie for a while before he passed away. In the movie there are a lot of cases were it reverts back to Chicago the musical(the original Bob Fosse musical not the revival). Velma rising from the floor at the beginning of All That Jazz, Roxie on the piano in Funny Honey, the cell bars in Cell Block Tango, the stipping of Billy in All I Care About, Roxie's name in lights in ROXIE, Mama Morton's fan in When Your Good to Mama, etc. Moulin Rouge had fancy sets and all that glam, but even with just a black stage Chicago do so much better. Chicago was ment for stage, Moulin Rouge wasn't. Sorry folks, but Chicago is the real winner and the real musical here.",1059436800,2,1504,4.574074074074074

Being a fan of both Moulin Rouge and Chicago I can safely say that both of these features are amazing and yet very different which is how it should be, no two films although in the same genre should be alike because if they are then everything will seem routine and old and the audience will ultimately get bored.",1059350400,,633,4.711711711711712

Specifically, at the start of the movie, you wondered where they were going with the storyline ... then everything came together and the movie became more and more enjoyable. As fas as the actors, I am not a fan of Renee (even had a problem seeing her in the role she played at first), but her role in the movie was a good one, and matched the roles she played in previous movies, along with Richard Gere playing the slick lawyer looking for which prison women's plight can pay the most.  Now Catherine was GREAT!  Her performance from beginning to end was magnificent.  You have to get the DVD and see it.
Also, I look at Moulin Rouge and Chicago as ""great performances.""  Some, that I have read, has bombed Chicago and praised Moulin Rouge.  Honestly, it depends on the viewer's open mind on what is being shown on the screen.  In short, one movie will not be like the other.

Also, this is not some spur of the moment musical. It is a classic, having been written and rewritten as a classic Broadway musical and various movie versions, one starring Marilyn Monroe. It is based on the real trials of two women in the thirties who did get away with murder. It is dark AND sexy, and the scene with the lady murderers singing about killing their men is one of the sexiest in the movie.

1475949,4,B00005JLSE,"The last two reviews of this film were as subjective as reviews could possibly be but what they lack is the ability to step back and actually look at what they've reviewed. This film is about immoral people but that doesn't change it's punch and it's honesty as both a musical and morality play skewed toward the cynical way we Americans view fame. As musicals go this is not Singing in the Rain or South Pacific, but it does have heart, guts and good musical talent just as the latter musicals had even if not in the same context. I find myself rooting for the little murderesses and not because I want them to get away with their crimes but to admire their spunk, guile and tenacity. On top of that who's worse; the ladies using the media or the public who allows, and gullibly applauds this manipulation? This film makes no effort to forgive the gals of their crimes, nor does the story try to make them out to be misguided little girls who deserve a shot at redemption. The sleazy lawyer who works to get them off the hook is also no nobleman. He's a vile but witty cad who exploits every trick in the book (as well as creating a few new ones) to defend the ladies. Couple that with the nearly flawless portrayals of the characters and their near perfect dance routines and I have to highly recommend this genuine musical. Renee' Zellweger is a treat as the seemingly naive minx aspiring to stardom and stupid enough to put herself within reach of the state's gallows. Catherine Zeta Jones as the very jaded, chain smoking Velma is wonderfully nasty but also no slouch when it comes to getting her way (learning a little humility along the way). At the heart of these two characters are women who've come to believe that fame and wealth are the only goals worth attaining. Their lawyer feels exactly the sme way in his shameless pursuit of difficult but very high profile, and very profitable cases. Richard Gere is a strange selection for the portrayal of this fellow. However, his skills were considerably better than I'd hoped and I found him not only convincing but downright engrossing as he wore this cretin's skin. The dance numbers clearly owe a nod to the master Bob Fosse who first adapted this story for the stage years ago. Fosse's urban cynicism oozes from these songs and dance numbers. Jones and Zellwegger are very good in their numbers. They're sincere efforts but not flawless. Despite that I found those efforts to be better than routine. They truly put themselves into their roles and played their characters with gusto. Character flaws fully exposed and elaborated on I still admired the spirit of these scoundrels if not the scoundrels themselves, well, maybe I have to confess to being a little taken with the bold lot of them. Queen Latifa (sp?) was another treat fully in her character and sumptuous in her performance. She conveyed such ease with her character it was like watching a person in a long running series, fully confortable with her role after years of playing it. Now, is this a great film musical? No, but it certainly is enjoyable and a far cry from what's been passing for musicals in recent years. Catchy tunes, good dancing and an engaging story and an inherent wit makes this much more than watchable. On top of that it has a surprising cast in the lead players as well as support characters. John C. Reilly's character as the poor slob married to Zellwegger's treacherous gal is another treat. He's the guy nobody sees, almost literally. He takes this one poor sap and plays him as the only guy with a conscience (though manipulated as it is) in this miasma of schemers and scammers. He's sincere, hopeful, but ultimately doomed to be background clutter. He's used when he's needed, ignored when he's not, and this fact becomes painfully evident to him as the film progresses. His musical number is subtle but if you really watch and listen you'll see that he's really putting himself into the position fully realized in the song. His number gave me chills upon repeated viewings. He's a decent guy but also a loser in love with someone who most likely will never know love. Rent this.

1476077,5,B00005JLSE,"If you look at this movie from an entirely moral perspective there is no doubt that you will find the subject and plot-line thoroughly unappealing...however if you look at the work as a whole--the cinematography, the choreography, the acting, the singing, and the dancing, you will truly appreciate it for what it is, a work of art.  Having not seen Moulin Rouge I can make no comparison between the two, and don't want to anyway.  If you call Chicago a ""New Age"" musical about the doldrums, downfall and moral degredation of our society you are forgetting that it is a Broadway musical and has been on stage for more than 25 years.
Being a dancer myself the dance scenes in the film are amazingly choreographed, and performed just as well.  To think that in three weeks off of dance I am already out of shape, and then to look at Catherine Zeta-Jones hit those dance numbers home amazes me.  She's incredible, as is Richard Gere, and Renee Zellweger.  I only have ONE complaint.  In ""The Gun"" the reporter who sings- I forget her name- tries to do an Entrechat (ballet) and it looks HORRIBLE because her legs are completely turned in.

It also relaxes some people, because Roxie speaks to the bad girl/boy in all of us.

1476079,4,B00005JLSE,"Film is a harsh mistress. Every imperfection is magnified a million times and, the worst part, permanently recorded for all the world to see. That's why Chicago is a pleasant surprise. Director Rob Marshall in collaboration with the other performers/artists involved with the film, has turned in one of the best movie musicals since the heyday of wunderkind Bob Fosse.
Based on the Kander & Ebb musical directed by maverick choregraphy Bob Fosse, Chicago manages to capture Fosse's spirit and make the transition from stage musical to film. That's a rarity since the ""death"" of the film musical. Rob Marshall manages to translate CHicago from one medium to another because he understands both and doesn't undercut the strengths of either medium; the musical numbers are mobile, well edited and choregraphed and he manages to integrate the mobility of film with the necessary static elements of the original stage play.
Although Marshall's choregrapher owes a great debt to Fosse's original work, it's uniquely his own. What's most surprising is that Marshall isn't afraid to tweak and play with the most successful elements from his stage version for the film.  Marshall keeps the original story intact. Zellweger and Zeta-Jones play, respectively, wanna-be caberet performer and the real deal who end up in prison after committing murder. Zellweger murders her lover who had promised to help her breakthrough into performing after he reveals he had no connections and was just using her for sex.
Zeta-Jones murders her husband and sister (her partner in their musical act)when they are caught in the act --quite literally--of commiting adultry. Thrown together due to their circumstances, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones circle like wary predators unclear on the concept of trust. They both want the same goal but it's clear that they both will do anything to reach their goals. The fact that the media rewards them with sympathetic portrayals in the paper due to their money hungry lawyer (Richard Gere)makes this trip down the dark side even more interesting.
Rene Zellweger (playing Roxie Hart) and Catherine Zeta-Jones both sparkle in their film debt as dancers and singers. While neither one has great voices, they are appropriate to the material. In fact, their strong backgrounds as actors add an element that might be missing from technically more gifted singers. Yes, they play amoral characters and, yes, none of the characters really have any socially redeeming values but they represent the very qualities that this cynical but witty look at media manipulation is all about.
Richard Gere is especially noteworthy. I'm not surprised that Gere's performance is so strong given his background in Broadway musical performances. What is surprising is that he'd take such a risky (but colorful) role so late in his career. His gold digging lawyer is every bit a manipulator as Roxie Hart(Zellweger). John C. O'Riley is a bit of a surprise. While he's a terrific actor, I never pictured him as a singer. He acquits himself quite well in a memorable musical number. O'Riley plays Roxie's dimwitted husband with a heart of gold. He's the only decent person in the whole film and the one everyone twists around for their own unjust cause.
The Kanter & Ebb songs are great. Fred Ebb's lyrics are witty and among the best he had written. Kanter's music is also a highlight. It's clear that Chicago is every bit the equal (although smaller in scope)of their classic Cabaret. If Chicago isn't quite as powerful as Fosse's film version of Cabaret or even All That Jazz, it's due to the smaller scope of the story. It's equally entertaining though.
The transfer is terrific with the crisp picture and colors captured vividly in this DVD transfer. The sound transfer is rich although there is some noticable compression in a couple of scenes. The behind the scenes featurette isn't anything special but does provide some insight into the challenges of translating a successful musical from one medium to another. The widescreen version preserves the original aspect ratio. Although I've always been a fan of widescreen, the standard full screen version is nicely done as well. Since this film is about the onscreen dancing and singing, there's some picture loss but it won't be noticable to most folks.",1058572800,8,4291,5.095170454545454
1476080,5,B00005JLSE,"This masterpiece has everything that defines 'Broadway Musical'.
An absolute joy to wallow in. Fantastic music, production, acting, dance, sound, art design, photography, everything.
The maturity of the cast is a testament to the care the makers took to reflect the snappy boards of yesteryear when music was half percussive precision, half soaring reeds and snappy brass. And all the artists had 10-20 years under their belts before they had the chance to strut their stuff big time.
No need to compare this to other flicks. On the other hand, if you check out All That Jazz (1979 by Fosse who created the original 1970 Chicago stageplay) you will see dance and music reflected and even improved. And if you want to wriggle into major retro, Pajama Game (1954) is where Fosse got his creative start - and you can see the seeds of his genius.

1476193,5,B00005JLSE,"I am an AVID musical lover and enjoy attending Broadway shows whenever possible. In May 2002, a full eight months before the film came to theatres, I saw ""Chicago"" on Broadway. It was, in a word, incredible. When I learned it was being made in a movie, I was very happy and spent many months anxiously anticipating its arrival. In January 2003, after seeing the film, I was even more astonished. Catherine Zeta-Jones, in the opening ""All That Jazz"", is simply stunning. I was equally impressed with Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger, but Zeta-Jones is truly incredible with her interpretation of Velma. But what surprised me most about all these actors is how well they became their characters. Their acting, singing, and dancing, is truly what musicals are. This film is Broadway on a movie reel, and it is not to be missed. Yes, the movie is about killing, and murder, and fame, and how it all goes to your head, but that is the point of the movie. It is a sort of satire of how murder and greed can make a person so popular and wanted that the crimes go unnoticed. THAT is the essence of ""Chicago"". It does not support murder; it helps to show audiences that fame sometimes can make us forget what really happened. If you are a musical fan, buy this movie. It is utterly fabulous. However, if you just view its surface, you will not understand the depth the actors have incorporated to the characters. I challenge you to watch and find the inner meaning to ""Chicago"".

The reviewers above must not have watched the same film I did, because Chicago is one of the most refreshing and wonderful films ever made. Moulin Rouge was wonderful, but Chicago took it to the next level. As for the musical being degraded from a cheery fantasy world to dark corners of society, I don't think the above reviewer has seen many musicals. The fact of the matter is, few musicals (especially since the 70s) are non-stop ""life is bunnies and daisies"" happiness. Even Oklahoma has its downer songs...and today, Broadway thrives on sheer fun (Hairspray and The Producers) and hard emotion (Cabaret, Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera).
Don't listen to the featured comments. Buy this movie, and you'll understand all that I've said...brilliant performances accompanied by brilliant direction and choreography. Drew Out.",1058054400,,881,5.1678321678321675
1476195,5,B00005JLSE,"Its a good musical. bold, brash, full of energy, bright, pushy. i would imagine a lot like the roaring 20's in Chicago.
built around the story of two women who kill the men in their lives. spur of the moment passion murder that puts both women in jail awaiting trial.
the movie is a switch back and forth between two 'circus rings' for want of a better image. the one ring is the musical numbers, the other ring is the storyline. life imitating art, then art returning the favor. very well done, because in one 'ring' you can say things differently, stronger, better than in the other 'ring'.
but there is another ring, real life, like the problem of the 4th wall,(the invisible wall separating the audience from the stage) is always there in an artistic piece, but you can't really talk about it. we watch their passion, their ambitions, their failings and most of all the way everyone plays to the crowd. whether the witness in the jury box to the jury, or the sexy musical numbers to us the audience. everyone knows the scheme is to present life enough like the real world to be believable yet unlike the real world in the ability to manipulate to prove a point.
in this way, the movie is a 3 ring circus, only we inhabit the 3rd ring with the movie, its actors, writers and the whole crew. this is why we watch the reality shows on tv. set our alarm clocks so we don't miss the latest crime drama. and go to movies like this. it involves us, it beguiles us with the similarity to real life, but like real life sometimes to play to the audience, to neglect the greater issues of life(what is guilt?), to realize that all the world is a stage and we but players.....neglects the duty to rise above this and act out of morality and responsibility.
i liked the movie, music and dancing is very good, despite the fact that i like neither very much. worth the time and thoughtful analysis afterwards. but i distaste the passion without direction, the ambition without direction, the winning without justice, and the movie seems to reveal in it. essentially saying if you can get away with murder than it is alright.
maybe the next Judge is less interested in outward appearances than innerward motivated, and less distracted by a pretty leg. let's hope so.",1057968000,9,2254,4.526960784313726
1476196,5,B00005JLSE,"Okay...I loved 'Moulin Rouge' for what it is and I loved 'Chicago' for what it is. What I believe is that they don't have enough in common to be compared so ruthlessly. 'Moulin' was thought up...'Chicago' was adapted from the stage. No wonder it had a more conducive and liquid story! It's been played on the stage for years and years, while MR was the brain-child of Baz Lurhman. I enjoyed the performances in both films, and I don't think the people (Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, Rob Marshall, etc) involved with either film will ever win enough awards to satisfy those of us who adore the movie/musical.
As a 'Chicago' fan, I do realize, however, that there would have been no 'Chicago' without 'Moulin Rouge'. MR found the audience for musicals. It awoke everyone to the inference that musicals were not only successful, but market-able in today's society. On one final note, about the Oscars, the only one I have a problem with is Nicole Kidman's win for 'The Hours.' Obviously the Academy was making up for the fact that they didn't give it to her for her much better performance in 'Moulin.' They know it, we know it, and oh well. At least she got one, right?
We should all just be ecstatic that the musical is back. I grew up watching classics like Liza Minelli's 'Cabaret' and 'There's No Business Like Show Business' with Marilyn Monroe.

Chicago is a fabulous film, much stronger than Gangs of New York for one big reason for me, I walked out of Gangs wondering why the movie was made. It was beautifully filmed, well acted by Daniel and others certainly, but the movie had a huge cloud of depression running throughout. And when it got to the end it made me feel like MS' message was ""Life is pointless, you won't make a difference no matter how hard you try, so why bother?""
It was really a shame becasue it truly had some good moments and Daniel was just superb, I do think he should have gotten the oscar..but oh well.
Now Chicago, ahh Chicago, for a film that is also about a depressing subject like Gangs, the Piano as well as The Hours it left you smiling and humming as you left the theater.
My BF who isn't a big musical fan loved this film and we both just had the time of our lives. Even more so since we saw Gangs on the same day!
Renee is amazing, she isn't a broadway star but she CAN sing and she was lovely and very convincing as Roxie, who ISN'T supposed to be as talented as Thelma.
Catherine Z-J was simply amazing as was Queen Latifah. But who really impressed me was Richard Geer, a lukewarm actor in my opinion and someone I thought was ""OK"" suddenly lit up the screen and impressed me so much. He obviously worked very hard and was so amusing as Billy Flynn, even if the others hadn't been as strong as they were I think I would have enjoyed this film. I've heard folks who've seen the original stage show say the movie is actual stronger and better as they cleanup a choppy plot and made it flow better for the song transitions.
As for the Moulin Rouge comments, OK the movie was awesome, it also deserved the Oscar but it didn't get it and that has NOTHING to do with why Chicago did! Relax people please....

Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply amazing and deserves every amount of praise she has received for her role as the sexy Velma Kelly. Rene Zellweger surprised audiences, bringing a new style to the role of Roxie Hart, but she isn't a natural musical theatre star like Zeta-Jones. Richard Gere shone as Billy Flynn, but his tap dancing left something to be desired. The musical numbers in this movie were nothing short of outstanding and left the audiences blown away. Rob Marshall brought his genius to this motion picture with the stage-like staging. While in the movie theatre it almost felt like watching a live performance on a stage. This is exemplified especially in numbers like ""Cell Block Tango"" and Catherine Zeta-Jones' best moment ""I Can't Do It Alone"".
Some reviewers have compared Chicago to last year's attempt-at-a musical Moulin Rouge. Chicago is what we call a real musical (with original songs and a solid 7 year run on Broadway with multiple Tony awards). Moulin Rouge was a movie that tried too hard. Moulin Rouge had potential but had too much fancy camera work that gave half its audience a headache. The dance sequences were awful. The camera moved so fast and was on such inappropriate angles for dancing that too much was lost; unlike Chicago where the cinematography showed off the dancing. Nicole Kidman is one of the greatest actresses of all time and was great in Moulin Rouge, but when it comes to musicals Catherine Zeta-Jones SHINES!
Chicago is wonderful and it earned every Oscar it won. Moulin Rouge didn't win at the Oscars because it just wasn't good enough. Chicago saved the face of the musical movie by showing the world how a musical movie should be.",1057622400,16,1811,4.8076923076923075

1476548,5,B00005JLSE,"First off, I've been one of this show's biggest fans since the '70's, but am not a huge fan of the ""concert version"" currently on Broadway. For years I've thought that this would be fun to see, but doubted that it could work since the only director that I've thought made this style of show translate was the late great Bob Fosse (CABARET). He, of course, was the driving force behind the original production. I just didn't think, even when they were talking the likes of Madonna, Rosie O'Donell (both would have been good, probably) that this theatrical style would work on film.
Imagine my surprise when Rob Marshall did the most shocking thing possible for a film director of a stage musical...he trusted the damn material!!! ***Gasp!!!** He didn't od the ""let's open it up"" or ""lets simplify it like the revival"" thing, but put the show onstage and it worked like gangbusters.
The cast is perfect. With all the compliments (deserved) that the 4 leads get, don't forget some of the other terrific performers John C. Reilley, Taye Diggs, and Christine Baransky (although I did miss having that great bit of having Mary Sunshine being exposed as a drag queen, but that wouldn't have translated. Plus that great cameo...VIVA CHITA RIVERA! What a great tip-o'-the hat to the original.

It is comparable to Moulin Rouge, but with a stupendously better soundtrack.  All songs contained within Chicago are originals for the stage version, although a few songs were lowered a key or two so that Catherine and Rene could really belt them.
As for some of the reviewers, specifically the one who said this is a a horrible new musical.  I am sorry to say you have been misinformed.  Firstly, this is certainly not a new musical.  It has been around for decades.  Also, it does not celebrate the murders.  In case you don't know, there is something called a farce, and Chicago is exactly that.  They use these overblown stories (i.e. The Cell Block Tango) to show what life was like in the roaring twenties.  Much like F. Scott Fitzgerald did when he wrote The Great Gatsby.

1476552,4,B00005JLSE,"Several of the user-contributed reviews for ""Chicago"" make it sound like the film (and the original play and earlier works they're based on) is a treatise on the virtues of sex and liquor.
In fact, in one way, it is. It's a commentary on how we, society, respond to celebrity and media manipulation.
The first time we see the lawyer, we hear him sing about how money means nothing to him (while he's being measured for custom suits, riding in expensive cars, and having beautiful women draped over him as part of the choreography for the song). Clearly, the visuals tell us, he's a manipulator.
Both female leads, excellently cast (although I would entertain arguments for others in the roles, these are fine examples of the craft), are similar manipulators. The brunette murders her lover and sister (who is also her partner in her stage act) and then boasts, later, that they ""had it comin'."" The blond murders her lover and then, having convinced her husband to take the fall for her, sings a ballad about how faithful he is and how much she loves him - until he realizes (about verse three of the song) that she's been two-timing him and rats her out. (I took my 63-year-old mother to see this, and she started laughing at that moment.) Mid-ballad, she changes her tune (literally) and starts singing about how disloyal he is.
""Chicago"" is not endorsing these creeps. It's telling us that we have a voyeuristic need to follow their stories, to be entertained by the media instead of being informed by it. Certainly, you cannot see ""Chicago"" without acknowledging some of the grime in our world, and in ourselves.
It's called ""art"".
The visual style of ""Chicago"" deliberately pulls you in, as ""Cabaret"" did, by putting [nearly] all the numbers into a night-club setting so that people don't just spontaneously break into song. (That's one the big complaints about old-time musicals that I hear, and Chicago/Cabaret can't be accused of having nuns on hill-tops breaking into song.)
It is a great film, even if it's a bit uncomfortable in places. (A press conference scene feels almost as frightening as a debate in Bullworth in which the title character points out that the press is in the entertainment business.)",1056672000,3,2216,4.818897637795276

1476622,5,B00005JLSE,"This film deserves all of the praise it receives, especially given the fact that it is derived from a Broadway musical (1973) which was, in turn, derived from two non-musical films, Chicago (1927) and Roxie Hart (1943). I can think of few other works of high quality which have such a heritage. (Can you name five film sequels which are superior to the original?) Crisply directed by Rob Marshall with choreography devised by Bob Fosse, this film operates simultaneously (and seamlessly) on two different levels of narrative: a murder trial which requires the main characters to act and a musical revue which requires them to sing and dance. Thus, the film has a multi-dimensional ""choreography"" for which Marshall deserves special credit. Frankly, I was surprised by Gere's performance, especially by his footwork both when dancing and while defending Roxie Hart (played by Renee Zellweger) in the courtroom. In my opinion, he deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. Among the targets of the film's social comments are the role of media in celebrity creation, how an adroit attorney such as Billy Flynn can manipulate the media to his clients' advantage, and how transient celebrity can be. Long ago, I recall my grandmother suggesting that ""Today's news wraps tomorrow's fish."" In all respects, this is a film with Snap! Crackle! and Pop!

1476623,5,B00005JLSE,"I have to say one thing to people out there.  STOP COMPARING CHICAGO AND MOULIN ROUGE!  They are two completely different movies. Chicago is traditional in it's form, and uses the very distinct Fosse dance moves to heat up the screen.  Moulin Rouge uses pop songs along with a classic love story while turning it inside out using modern movie making techniques.
I have to say one thing about Chicago.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was so hot in this movie, I am very suprised that the screen didn't burst into flames every time she was on it.  The film's All That Jazz opening is so impressive, it's hard to put into words.  I really liked the part when Velma whips around on ""all...that..."" and it turns into Roxie to complete the line, ""JAZZ!"" as part of her day dream.  Then, as the number continued, Roxie and Fred's movements imitated those being preformed on stage by Velma and the dancers.  It was a good idea from whoever had it.
Also, Rob Marshall was the right guy to direct this stuff.  I honestly don't think anyone could have done a better job then he did on Chicago.  And, please, don't compare Rob to Baz!  Both were the right men to direct each movie they made.
Some people are complaining that the movie's main characters are all murders or money hungry slimebags.  Well, it is what the original play Chicago was about, and I thought this would be obvious; It is a musical song and dance romp, not meant to be taken so seriously.
Finally, I am sure a lot of people who see Chicago will enjoy it.  To those who don't, at least admire the excellent craftsmanship that went into it.",1056240000,,1588,4.491289198606272

I don't mind old musicals from the 50s like Singing in the Rain, but when a new movie comes out that's a musical, I just think it's kind of weird in modern film-making, even if the movie is based on a Broadway show.  Remember to take that into consideration about my review, because it probably means the movies better than what I say.
Based on the Broadway show, ""Chicago"" was about Roxy Hart, who got arrested for shooting and killing the man she was cheating on her husband with.  She then goes to prison, and with some help from Mama (Queen Latifa) and her lawyer (Richard Gere), she is able to win the public's support, lie her way through her court trial, and become a famous Vaudeville actress.
The musical parts of this movie were the highlight, even though the music wasn't your typical Danny Elfman (based his music on the original from the broadway show).  The musical sections would come in as Roxy would imagine an alternate reality where she was a famous singer, and the whole story was a show.  The highlights of the best musical scenes were where everyone was Richard Gere's puppet, and he did the talking for Roxy and a croud of reporters.  This was probably one of the most fun scenes in the movie, but the Circus/Courtroom scene was also very well done.  It switched flawlessly from reality to Roxy's imagination.
Like I said, I don't like most musicals, so my rating may be lower than it would be if I loved musicals, but overall, I'll give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.  Pretty good if you ask me from someone who doesn't like musicals.",1056067200,,1599,4.489655172413793

Brilliant performances from Zeta-Jones and Zellweger and strong support from Latifah, Gere and Reilly.
The choreography is definitely Fosse inspired, but manages to still be original and inventive.  The expansion of ""Cell Block Tango"" works wonderfully for the film and setting the plot more in Roxie's imagination than on a vaudeville stage, solves many of the narrative problems of Ebb and Fosse's book.
Don't miss a quick cameo by Miss Chita Rivera (the original Velma Kelly in the 1975 Broadway production), as a worn-out inmate giving Zellweger's Roxie some advice on Mama Morton.

1476627,4,B00005JLSE,"Apparently, musicals are back in style these days. Last year's, Moulin Rouge hinted the return of the genre in Hollywood. This year, it is back in full form with much flair in Rob Marshall's Chicago.
  Musical used to be a staple of Hollywood during its golden age. At its peak , it produced such unforgettable classics such as  My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, and the Sound of Music. However, in the late sixties the genre started to lose its steam and since then it was slowly phased out from the silver screen. Those in the film industry attributed the  main cause of its demise to the audience's change of taste. The audience had simply grown tired of the form. Others cited problems with the budget which tended to snowball in most movie adaptations of a stage production. Whatever its reason , it seemed true that musical was finally dead. However, after decades of hiatus, people are once again ready to embrace the genre, and for the most part, Chicago does not disappoint us.
  The film revolves around two murderesses, a somewhat famous chorus singer named Velma Kelly(played by Catherine Zeta-jone) and a nonentity called Roxie Hart(played by Renee Zellweger) who aspires to perform on stage just like Velma. Coincidentally, fate has it that both of them end up in jail for murdering their lovers who had done them wrong. At first there's no doubt that they are on a sure-fire track to the gallows. But then a publicity-seeking hot shot lawyer by the name of William Flynn (played by Richard Gere) takes an interest in their case. At first, Velma receives much of the attention since she already had a semi-celebrity status. However Flynn starts to discover Roxie's talent in dazzling the public. As the story progresses, the two vixens vie against one another to hog the attention of their lawyer and more importantly , the spotlight from the public. Soon the crimes they committed  start to become less important than what they are wearing for their trial.
  The movie brims with mordant criticism of how the American trial system can be susceptible to the influence of the media. Such critiques aren't exactly covering new territory. During the past decade, we saw a surge of such criticism in the wake of the O.J. Simpson's case, Lorena Bobbitt's case, Tanya Harding's case and numerous others. There have been movies made about it too. In Gus Van Sant's To Die For, Nicole Kidman played a similar type of publicity-addict. In Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, a pair of mass murderers were given the spotlight.
The movie Chicago is based on a famous Broadway play during the 70's which is in turn based on a novel. The novel itself is said to draw as its source from a real life event in the 20's with a story similar to Roxie and Velma's. As one can see, the bond between  crimes and the media goes back a long time.
  So how does the movie fare? As I said before it does not disappoint us. The two leads , Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones throw themselves out there with a palpable conviction. There's no question that these two stars invested a lot of time in getting their dance routines right. Equally impressive is the supporting ensemble cast, including Ricahrd Gere as the smarmy lawyer, Queen Latifah as the 'matron Momma', John C. Reilly as the cuckold husband, and Christine Baranski as the sycophantic reporter. If my count is correct, there are about ten musical numbers, nine of which that takes place in Roxie's imagination. Credits should be given to the script writers for coming up with such a clever story device. As for the singing, however, my feelings are divided. Some of them are excellent. Queen Latifah is naturally good (she's better known for her music career after all), John C. Reilly delivers a surprisingly luscious voice, and as for Catherine Zeta-Jones, to hear her belt out the opening tune 'All that jazz', should alone be worth the admission price of 7000 wons. But Renee Zellweger's singing leaves much to be desired. Although it isn't exactly bad, it's not all that impressive either. She suffers from the same problem Nicole Kidman faced in Moulin Rouge. She simply doesn't have a strong enough voice. However compared to Richard Gere's singing, hers is Pavarotti. I expect the audience to cringe as I did when he gets his voice running. Some people should just not be allowed to sing.
  At the moment, Chicago is the front runner in the Oscar race with thirteen nominations including Best Picture. I expect the film to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar, not because I believe the film is a masterpiece, but because the competition is so weak. Although I do not feel the picture deserves a space on the mantelpiece alongside the likes of The God Father or Schindler's List, I do admit to having enjoyed two hours of good entertainment. 5,6,7,8..hit it!

That innovative musical made this one seem stale and old hat. It should have been made in the 50s. The film seems so delighted at poking fun at Chicago and its corrupt justice system -- jeez, that was fresh when Hecht and MacArthur wrote The Front Page three-quarters of a century ago. Now, after their masterpiece (and Roxy Hart, Some Like It Hot and dozens of other films) its premise is stale, stale stale. And unlike Moulin Rouge, which used an equally stale plot to re-invigorate the way movie musicals were presented, Chicago's staging was an stale as its story line.
The musical numbers might have been staged by Vincent Minelli ... I didn't find anything fresh or innovative or even memorable.
I was shocked that Renee Zellwegger's blah performance was on Oscar. At least she was better than Richard Gere -- what a disasterous performance.

1476698,5,B00005JLSE,"Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is arrested for murder of her husband and her sister that she has just committed.  Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) sees Velma's last performance at the Vaudeville Theater as she dreams of her own fame.  Roxie works hard to achieve her dream by cheating with a furniture salesman, but something goes wrong and she kills the salesman.  Through the hard way, Roxie learns that everything is run by Matron 'Mama' Morton (Queen Latifah) and she meets Velma who is still seeking fame from within the prison through Mama.  When Roxie finds out that she might get hanged she seeks help and Mama informs Roxie that she should get William 'Billy' Flynn (Richard Gere) as her lawyer, since he has never lost a case.  Over a night, Mr. Flynn turns the nobody killer Roxie into a star by tweaking the truth to what the news media wants to hear.  In the process, Velma falls into the shadow and becomes desperate to get back into the light of fame.  Chicago is an interesting film, since it implies the audience as a driving factor in the search for fame within the main characters of the film.  In addition, the film's musical and dancing elements boost the messages to such an extent that the messages become easily comprehendible.  The editing also increases the tempo of the film as well as the score.

1476779,5,B00005JLSE,"I am a fan of the Broadway musical format and had been hoping for a movie version of Chicago every since seeing the stage version reviewed on the Charlie Rose show.  This movie version meets my hopes and expectations.  It is fast paced and moves faultlessly from semi-realism to fantasy in the blink of an eye.  The Fosse-esque dance scenes are wonderful and the singing is very good.  I was sorry when the movied was over.
There have been some complaints about the plot but, like almost all musicals, this isn't a movie that you go to see as an example of cinematic skill in plot development.  The plot is almost comic-book simple, like the movie Dick Tracy which starred Madonna.  You go for the dancing, the music, the pretty women, the singing, etc.
Considering that the movie musical has been out of style for a while, they probably didn't have a long list of potential actors for the roles - I think, however, that the actors did very well, especially Zeta-Jones.  Liza Minelli at her best might have done better in that part as she had a truly outstanding voice but I can't think of anyone available now who might have bettered Zeta.  I have not been a Richard Gere fan but maybe that is because he has been miscast, in this role he was great.  Zellweger had the biggest stretch to make from her background.  You wonder how the director decided on her since she was the greatest gamble.  Madonna might have done that part ten years or so ago but I can't think of anyone else with a name who could have done it better than Rene.

1476783,5,B00005JLSE,"From Catherine Zeta-Jones' kickass Velma Kelly, to Queen Latifa's mercenary Matron Morton, the motion picture version of the Broadway musical classic is practically perfect in every way.
Apparently, Oscar voters agreed: awarding the razzle dazzle musical six Golden Statuettes including Best Picture! This is an amazingly entertaining, if cynical, piece, with one of Kander & Ebb's best musical scores.
Perfection could have been achieved had the filmmakers re-created Bob Fosse's landmark choreography. Instead, director Rob Marshall and his boyfriend reinvented the dances. The result is very good, indeed. But Fosse's work was far superior.
Still and all, this is a five-star film, and great motion picture entertainment.

1476878,5,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is easily the best stage-to-screen adaptation since Cabaret. This is hardly surprising as both projects have a similar pedigree. Both stand as tributes to the work of Bob Fosse, the dancer, actor, choreographer and director whose unmistakable style is the very essence of this film. Fosse brought jazz to Broadway, bringing together two of the most American of art forms. He brought that same magic to movies and this film is the perfect homage to his craft.
Chicago tells the sordid tale of an ingnue whose dreams of stardom are shattered, it seems, when she murders a suitor who she discovers has claimed he can give her a big break when he only wants to get her into bed. The murder charge actually turns out to be her big break as her infamy catapults her into the headlines. Chicago beautifully blends theatrical and cinematic space and style in a way that few films before have achieved. It remains flawlessly faithful to the stage production while enhancing it with electric editing and pulsing pace. While many musicals have been muted and diluted by their transition into movies, under the lean vital direction of Rob Marshall, Chicago is actually invigorated by it.
Much of this has to do with some unexpectedly assured performances from a cast not usually known for soft-shoe shuffling. Catherine Zeta-Jones appears to have particularly brazen abilities from her little-known background as a musical comedy actress. She brings it all to bear from the first moments when she turns celluloid into sequins from her breathtaking opening number. Renee Zellweger is even more of an astonishment. Despite her wispy screen presence and skeletal frame, she has a robust talent and her moments on screen are quite magnetic. Richard Gere is equally remarkable and he carries off the role of the publicity-hunting lawyer with great relish and considerable charm.
While Moulin Rouge reintroduced the musical only to deconstruct it, Chicago reconstructs it from the ground up, returning to the basic building blocks of the form. Chicago gives you the ol' razzle-dazzle but with exciting new energy and direction, and few films this year will be as rousing or as dazzling.",1052784000,,2176,5.0472222222222225

 To not make people angry I'll look at the movies good parts first. It has a relievingly dry wit and satire, the script isn't exactly shimmering but it is carried very well by Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta Jones (Who, of the nominees, deserved the best supporting actress Oscar), and (to an extent) Richard Gere. It provides a great portrayel of a 1920's Jazzy Chicago that is satirical and realistic (except for the part about people spontaniously breaking in song and dance).
 Now the bad. There are the wierd casting decisions such as Queen Latifah (who as far as I'm concerned got nominated because she was in it) and John C. Riley (who got nominated because the Academy thought ""Jesus, this guy's in everything. Maybe if we give him a nomination he'll stop""). The plot can seem repetive, predictable, and all around just plain rediculous at times. But most of all what keeps this from being a favorite of mine is probably the most important element in a musical, THE MUSIC! With the exception of ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cellblock Tango"" None of the songs are very catchy at all. And the dance sequences were [filmed] in a very uncreative and confusing cinematographic decision, they take place in Zellweger's Mind. Not only that but it flashes back and forth between her imagination and reality, which is not only cheesy but also just [inexpensive] here's this, here's that trick. That kind of thing is easy to do in a movie and is much more impressive on stage.
 In short, a half great-half horrible cast isn't going to fuel a mediocre script with tiring musical numbers (well it has, it shouldn't though.)...",1051920000,,1618,4.771428571428571

1477430,3,B00005JLSE,"I may be biased, as I must admit I am no big fan of musicals. So, everybody who is into musicals, can easily add an extra star to this rating. I also feel that musical belongs to the stage, and like all other stage performances, it is not so easy to transfer into a film format. This hard task is rarely well accomplished, and to be honest, I do not see any big need of uniting the worlds so separate and different as stage (musical in particular) and cinema.
Having said that, we must remember that making a good film of a musical IS POSSIBLE. ""Cabaret"" is maybe the finest and best known example. Reviewing ""Chicago"" we shall not avoid some references to this obvious classic.
To rate a musical really high, it must be not only a good film, but also contain good songs.
Let's start with the songs here and be frank. Come on, the songs here are mostly forgettable! Are there many songs that you really want to sing along during the film and weeks afterwards? Nope! Maybe the only really catchy song here is ""If You Are Good To Mama"", but the somehow wooden performance of Queen Latifah made it forgettable when I was watching the movie (especially that it was terribly boring to this point), and only weeks afterwards I realised the song was really catchy! Compare it with ""Cabaret"" and you'll know what I mean! Although not great, the songs weren't also bad, so we can afford 3 for the music here.
If the songs were just so-so, was perhaps the film very good, with an entertaining plot or perhaps with deep inner or social sense? Again, no, no, no! After first half a hour I wanted to go out of the theater - I found the story so dumb and dull. A stupid lady killing her lover because he refused to make a star of her as he promised to do just to attract her. So typical, so cliched story that it's a waste of words even to describe it. But I stayed in the theater and things started to move faster, with another lady-murderer (Zeta Jones), clever but cynical lawyer (Gere), and a bunch of other, quite colourful characters. So, it started to be kinda funny, but never outstanding and really entertaining. I also find the story not so dumb overall. It pictured the totally cynical, amoral atmosphere of pre-war Chicago quite well. ( But the picture of papers and media brainwashing ordinary people is more timeless). Maybe I'd prefer a drama for this plot instead of farce, but it was OK.
The characters were played OK. Zellweger was not very sexy, but played an angel-faced but totally depraved witch quite well. I also do not understand the criticisms of Zeta-Jones performance based on her well-rounded posture. First of all, she is really sexy. Personally, I am very fond of all these round shapes and many other men are! Come on, critics, are you really fans of all these thin anorectics? I do not believe. Also, I am very fond with Gere's performance. It was criticised here as being ""wooden"". But man, he played a lawyer - so should be a bit wooden! But his face was so cynical that made an almost archetypic lawyer.
I could not stop laughing when I saw him and his small, clever eyes and he reminded me so much of all these too many lawyers I met in my life!
So, I think ""Chicago"" is an OK. movie, but lightweight and instantly forgettable. I do not regret I saw it, but would rather not buy a DVD or watch it second time (but there were only a few movies I was eager to see more than one time). I have red an interview with Zellweger, where she compared this movie to a beautiful, excellent candy. I would rather compare it to a rather tasteless (although not bad) candy in a very colourful, beautiful paper.

1477432,5,B00005JLSE,"Truth be told, I honestly thought Chicago was much better than Moulin Rouge but then again that's my personal opinion. I thought the latter was a little all over the place musically.
I've watched tons of stage musicals as well as those translated onto the big screen & this version of Chicago ranks as one of the best I've seen, both stage & screen.
The feel to the entire movie was one of genuine fun & the musical tunes were better than the originals performed by previous performers I thought.
Didn't think Queen Latifah nor John C Reilly were particularly outstanding (hence my surprise at their Oscar nominations, one of which should have gone to Richard Gere instead) but still held the film together with their decent supporting performances. The 3 main cast members were very good given that I didn't initially expect much from them from a musical standpoint (til I found out about their musical/dance backgrounds - yes even Gere sang before).
Overall a very entertaining film. Well worth watching & listening to a good few more times.",1051315200,,1043,4.8
1477433,5,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is the most upbeat, amazing spectecular movie of 2002.  I mean it has been in theatres since December it obviously did somthing right.
  All three main actors give remarkable strong performances.  Renee Zellweger as the ditzy, not so smart dreamer does excellent in her role as Roxie Hart.  Catherine Zeta Jones does just as good as the gaudy, singer, dancer, and murderer Velma Kelly.  And also Richard Gere as the showy professional lawyer Billy Flynn.  Included in the Cast is Queen Latifa as the big mama, and also Tay Diggs as the band leader.  All along with a hundred dancing singing extras who have a role of there own.
  The Music is the best! You will constanlty be singing one of the 14 major songs included in the film.  All the music is ubeat and fast, except for a few which are a bit depressing.  Along with the music the dancing is unbeliable!!  The whole cast dances in there own little way it is amazing.
  If your looking for an ubeat, jazzy, cynical, musical CHICAGO is for you.  If you don't wann go to the theatre and see it then wait till August 19, 2003 for that is when it will be avaivalbe on DVD and Video.

The film uses all possibilities it can find and require to transform the screen into a total ballet, with several layers of dancing, especially a background that has its own autonomy and yet takes part in the whole thanks to editing special effects. The film constantly shifts from the real story into the musical construction and imaginary artistic dream. But what can the meaning of this film be ? Just a few questions. Why is the first ever hanged woman in Illinois a Hungarian who does not speak English ? What can we do with the vision of the defense lawyer as a director and choreographer of a superproduction for the best musical theaters ? What can we do with the acquittal of two criminals on the basis of lies and manipulations ? How can justice be that manipulatable ? Isn't it the very negation of justice itself ? And yet the film is highly entertaining and pleasant and tries to show in all possible ways that women are the victims of men and have to organize themselves to resist this male-dominated society, though the lawyer who saves them, if he wants, if he is paid enough, is a man, the very negation of the previous idea. So contradictions and contradictions, and contradictions. And yet these contradictions make the film even more attractive and entertaining by erasing the seriousness of the discourse that lies behind this shimmering, glittering and glimmering surface.

Great cast: John Reilly as a believable, downtrodden Amos Hall.  Renee Zwelleger romps as Roxie Hart, rising out of the ashes of a murder charge.  Zeta-Jones is the sexiest of all dancing up a storm early on, then bringing down the house along with Zwelleger in a closing number that shines.
Rob Marshall's direction at first appeared too heavy handed but really rolled with the prison sequences and the courtroom action.

1477641,5,B00005JLSE,"I came to see this movie with some doubt, It had very good reviews and lots of nominations for the Golden Globe, I had seen the trailer and thought, well, it will be either very good or very dull. And since it was Rob Marshall's first movie, it was all a mystery, but then the film started and wow did it rocked, or should I say, it jazzed. I had seen very few musicals, only 3 if you skip Disney's musical/animated films, one good(The Sound of Music), the other also good but also the most depressing film ever(Dancer in the Dark) and one that it had it's moments but just wasn's enough(Moulin Rouge). But Chicago, it blew me away, everything in it was amazing.
First, the cast, all of them were magnificent, thank good they all got award-recognition in some award and in some capacity. I was shocked when Richard Gere was ignored completely by the Academy, it was one of the many, but many mistakes it made this year,and yeah sure, even though he would not have won, he should have at least gotten the nomination, I mean, he was great, and he was the one who had it the hardest, because he had 3 musical pieces that involved dancing and singing, and on top of that, a tap with virtually zero musical background, plus the acting in the rest of the film which was great.
Rene was the best, at least to me, and she deserved the Oscar, not Nicole, because both were great, but what made Rene better was that she carried out every possible human reaction in Chicago, she cried, she laughed, she sang, she danced, she was angry, she was lusty, she did everything and did it all very good, while Nicole did the same thing all the way through The Hours, she was sad and depressed, that's it, so here is mistake number 2 in the Oscars.
Catherine Zeta-Jones was also magnificent, and just as Rene, she looked both very sexy and acted wonderfully, thank God she did get the Oscar, I mean she even sang in the ceremony, pregnant and all, but she did it, and Queen Latifah, although she was surprisingly good, we all knew she had no chance, but anyway, in her case is really just an honor to be nominated, not because she was bad, but because she was against monsters(you know what I mean). And finaly, John C. Reilly, he was fantastic as Amos ""Cellophane"" Hart, and well, I can accept Chris Copper winning, but at least he got the nomination.
Then we have the director, in this category I also think the Academy made a huge mistake, not only did the failed to give the award to Scorsese, who was first in line, and before the name got read, I said, it will go either to him, or to Rob Marshall, the ones that really deserved it, but Polanski, come on, I mean, I love his work, Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, all great, and The Pianist was magnificent also, but come on, The Pianist was quite similar to Schindler's List, and that doesn't make The Pianist bad, but Chicago and Gangs of New York were movies we have not seen before, and those were the directors that deserved the gold, not a director mixed up in sex offences, but a director who managed to create a wonderful and fantastic world with lots of flash, dash, magnificent performances, dance numbers, and last but not least, all that jazz.
Some have complained that Chicago is boring and dumb, well, for those people I can only say one thing, stick to dumb and mass pleasing films like Daredevil, Scream and Just Married, films made to bring joy to numb masses.
Chicago is great and I think both people who know a lot about films can love it just as casual movie viewers, and that's good, isn't grand , isn't great, isn't swell. Anyway, I recomend this film a lot, personaly, it's not only good, it's very relaxing, you just sit back and enjoy good filmaking that has humour, sexy women in sexy dance numbers, plus a story with lot's of content and that is very enjoyable. Ofcourse, see it first before buying it, that's something you must do before buying any film, at least in an original release, why? To see if it's worthy of spending give or take [few] bucks on it, I think Chicago is very worthy, and most likely, after you see it, you will feel the same.

1477643,5,B00005JLSE,"I have to say I had doubts going into this movie....musicals aren`t really my thing, and none of the actors really stood out for me, but Chicago was absolutely AMAZING!! It was the best movie I`ve seen in a LONG time! The music, the songs, the dancing, the acting were all something to be remembered. The fact that Zellweger, Jones and Gere did their own singing/dancing only shows how amazingly talented they all are.
 Catherine Zeta Jones definitely steals the show in my opinion. Who can not love her as the beautiful, singing, dancing vixen. I applaude the casting...because no one else could have done it better. The Acedemy was right on in their decision to award her with that Oscar! She more then deserves it! Really, I just can`t say enough about her talent, beauty, and overall performance.
  Richard Gere was completely adorable! Who knew he could sing like that? That tapdance blew me away, I couldn`t even believe it was really him doing that. Boy, does he age well or what? Again, this part was perfectly cast.
  Renee Zellweger was great, not as amazing as some of the others, but great. She`s just naturally cute and that`s perfect for the role of Roxie, ""the sweetest little lady accused of murder"". Also, I gotta say I love her voice, its very jazzy and sweet.
  And who can forget Queen Latifah! Wow! The only thing I could`ve hoped for was more of her on screen...(she only had one major number).
  Anyway...ABSOLUTELY Amazing, beautifully made, and just plain fun. Even for those who don`t really get into the whole song and dance thing. Add to that the awesome soundtrack with the hilarious ""Funny Honey"", ""Razzle Dazzle"" and ""We Both Reached for the Gun"", sexy and fun ""Cell Block Tango"" (one of my favorite) and beautifully sung ""Nowadays""...and you`ve got one great movie!",1050105600,,1797,4.752411575562701
1477734,2,B00005JLSE,"This Broadway-to-screen musical is one I could have lived without. Its winning the academy awards makes one wonder. Obviously, it is not my kind of music.
Roxie would have been a smash at the Roxy Theater. From the ads, I had expected her to be a copy of Marilyn Monroe; instead, she was Shirley MacLaine as Sweet Charity.
In my opinion, the best part of this strange combined crime story/musical was the bittersweet piece by Amos (John C. Reilly). There were actually only three big numbers all of which expended a great deal of energy and talent.
The actor who played the judge was perfect for that part --liked the portrait of the blindfolded Miss Justice behind the judge in courtroom.
Richard Gere has aged well, but can he really tap dance?  This trial (reminiscent of the Scopes fiasco of times gone by) proved that all criminal attorneys must be showmen at times.
That was a sleazy time in America's musical history; it was a decandent era as shown so well in THE CAT'S MEOW, about the Hearst coverup of the mysterious death on his yacht, which has similar music but no big performances.

I went to a stadium seating theatre with a big screen and great sound.  From the first frame to the last, I loved every minute of it.  The music was great as well as the story and perfomances.
Most the reviews here seem to be one star or 5 stars.  I just can't imagine anyone hating this movie. I went back 3 more times to see it, and liked it more each time.
I can understand some of the criticism of the director, but there was enough traditional scenes that the chop chop chop style wasn't much of a bother to me.  In fact some of it added to certain scenes.
I truly don't understand how this movie was cast with of bunch of actors with little musical background..Shows you how much I know.  They were all great.
Queen Latifah was just plain great.  Her character in the movie was a little off.  First she is a tough talking prison matron, then she's real nice and understanding...oh well, her performance especially musically was top notch.
If you're tired of war movies, and sappy comedies, go see this and just lose yourself in two hours of sexy fun with great music.

1477739,5,B00005JLSE,"Bob Fosse's sexy cynicism still shines in Chicago, a faithful movie adaptation of the choreographer-director's 1975 Broadway musical. Of course the story, all about merry murderesses and tabloid fame, is set in the Roaring '20s, but Chicago reeks of '70s disenchantment--this isn't just Fosse's material, it's his attitude, too. That's probably why the movie's breathless observations on fleeting fame and fickle public taste already seem dated. However, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are beautifully matched as Jazz Age vixens, and Richard Gere gleefully sheds his customary cool to belt out a showstopper. (Yes, they all do their own singing and dancing.) Whatever qualms musical purists may have about director Rob Marshall's cut-cut-cut style, the film's sheer exuberance is intoxicating. Given the scarcity of big-screen musicals in the last 25 years, that's a cause for singing, dancing, cheering. And like Mr. Billy Flint says...That's Chicago! Even though I am a live theatre fan and have seen the show on stage, I thought the movie was amazing. Of course the vocals and choreography were fabulous, but what I especially liked was the lighting and special effects. Most stage plays don't make it on the big screen, but Chicago did it all!

It has been a long time since I have been to a movie where I had a smile on my face during the entire show.  It was only with great restraint that I didn't embarrass myself by applauding after every dance number.

However, the opening song ""All that Jazz,"" performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Velma Kelly), simply shocked me.  Zeta-Jones is truly talented and has a strong, wonderful and beautiful voice.  Her performance really surprised me.
The movie went on to throw out other astounding numbers such as ""Funny Honey,"" ""When You're Good to Mama,"" ""Cell Block Tango,"" ""Razzle Dazzle,"" and ""Mr. Cellophane"" to name a few.  The performances of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zellweger, and Richard Gere shocked me completely.  I had no idea they could sing or dance like that, and every number was so rich with talent and life that I found myself lost in the movie.
As Richard Gere said, each song really does have amazing entertainment value.  The music, lyrics, performance of the actors, the choreographing...everything was simply amazing.  By the end of the movie I didn't want to leave.  I have never before enjoyed musicals and while this one does have its old Broadway persona to live up to, it is truly a wonderful movie.
Rene Zellweger's musical performance pales a bit in comparison to the rest, especially to Zeta-Jones whose previous musical experience was unknown to many, but she did a wonderful job portraying the star-struck, fame-chasing Roxie Hart.  Richard Gere (Billy Flynn) gives a wonderful performance with his acting and singing, as well as tap dancing which he learned just for this movie.
Queen Latifah (Mama Morton) and John C. Reilly (Amos Hart) were wonderful as well, and everyone really did hold their own.  The casting was well done, the singing and dancing (all performed by the actors themselves) is simply wonderful and will keep you glued in your seat and locked on the screen from start to end.
A must-see for everyone!!!",1048809600,12,1998,4.847058823529411

1477836,2,B00005JLSE,"This review is not for people who like musicals.  If you do like musicals, then Chicago is a dream come true.  Under Rob Marshall's direction, Chicago manages to achieve the same kind of visceral impact as a live Broadway show, and that is an amazing accomplishment.  The choreography is excellent, the performances are solid, and you're certain to be entertained for a solid two hours...
...if you like musicals.
If you do NOT like musicals (that would be 98% of the heterosexual male population, not that there's anything wrong with it), then do NOT see Chicago.  I don't care if someone forces you to see it - tell them it's for their sake that you don't want to go.  They don't want to sit next to someone rolling their eyes and checking their watch every five minutes, so let them know that.
I've always found the musical to be a fundamentally flawed form.  It's always been an invitation for performers to overact and dance around like spastik children.  Musicals also are an excuse for threadbare plots and cliched writing.  They also always inevitably, and painfully, encourage a veritable orgy of Jazz Hands.  And when they're over, their usually chorusless songs rattle around in your head for a solid year, especially when those songs breathlessly shout out single words in an attempt to sound sexy (""Squish!  Cicero!  Lipschitz!"").  Horrifying, indeed.  And Chicago, despite being an all-around excellent musical, doesn't do anything to discourage those stereotypes.  It garnered tons of acting accolades (most notably Catherine Zeta-Jones' Oscar), but no one here is really acting, they're performing.  All you need to know is how many actors were considered for these roles to know it's not exactly a stretch to play these characters.  They're broad, to say the least.
Again, if musicals are your thing, then Chicago will probably be your favorite movie of the year.  But musicals are like cats.  If you like them, you adore them.  If you do not like them, you would rather be dragged across a field of thumbtacks than be anywhere near one.  If you are in the latter category, and you can tell by now that I am, then don't go see Chicago.  Nothing about it will convince you otherwise.",1048809600,3,2199,4.841823056300268

1477948,3,B00005JLSE,"I'm so disappointed this film won best picture. It should have gone to The Pianist. ""Chicago"" was just okay. I still don't get how so many people thought this film was great. It was alright and that's it. I'll admit I don't care for musicals one bit. They're often shallow and riddled with one musical number after the next, with little plot. ""Chicago"" fits the bill. I liked ""Moulin Rouge"". It was original and different, but ""Chicago"" struck me as a typical, classical, paint-by-the-numbers musical. I also know that when my grandmother informs me that she and my grandfather went to the movie theater to see ""Chicago"" twice (and they never see a movie twice, nor go to the movies very often) that it's definitely an old fashioned, paint-by-numbers movie. My girlfriend agreed that ""Chicago"" was just a moderately, modestly decent film. I would have preferred something with more depth and meaning like ""Gangs Of New York"" or ""The Pianist"" to win best picture over such lightweight fare as ""Chicago"". Don't get me wrong, Bob Fosse was a talented playwright/director, but this movie didn't do all that much for me.",1048636800,6,1115,4.873684210526315
1477949,5,B00005JLSE,"Chicago is my favorite movie of all, sharing the place with Moulin Rouge. I don't know how to explain how wonderful it is. The music is amazing, the performances are perfect, the plot is great, the dance numbers are absolutely wonderful, in summary it's PERFECT!!!! I looooooove all kinds of musicals, but I love this the most. And even if you don't like musicals, you will love this movie. I know people who hate musicals, but loved this movie. The fact that it's based in a real musical, makes it already perfect, I mean that they had adapted a theatre play into a movie, and not a simple movie, a great movie is almost unbelievable. Catherine, Rene, Richard and Latifah, all give such wonderful performances. Catherine is a great singer and dancer, and Rene too. I think this movie really deserves all the awards it has recieved, and the fact that it won 6 Oscars, including Best Supporting Actress for Catherine and of course Best Movie, proves it. If you haven't seen it, go and watch it, you can be sure you will love it, and if you don't you have a really big problem.",1048636800,,1075,4.517948717948718
1477950,5,B00005JLSE,"Frankly, I used to think musicals weren't my thing. I am an 18 year-old male, so I never thought I'd like musicals. And then I saw Moulin Rouge, and loved it. When my friend Michelle told me Chicago would be released soon, I was skeptical, but interested. And I must say, I was COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY. The film was incredible. The director found a great way to bring the stage to the screen. The aesthetics in this film are incredible. The film is just beautiful.
I am in high school, and I know that most high school students have a really really BAD taste in films. Unsurprisingly, most of them hated Chicago; however, most of them enjoy films like Jackass and South Park.
If you're into more intelligent, theatrical, aesthetically pleasing films, see Chicago!
I am hoping, due to Chicago and Moulin Rouge's successes, more musicals will be released in the upcoming years.",1048636800,,873,4.712418300653595
1477951,5,B00005JLSE,"Let me frst say that I'm not a fan of musicals. I thought Moulin Rouge was daring but empty. Chicago is an incredible film, highlighted by its revolutionary way of blending the musical numbers with acting. The idea that the preformances were part of Roxie's mind is brilliant. The BEST movie (not named Two Towers) of 2002 !!",1048636800,,325,4.620689655172414
1477952,5,B00005JLSE,"Roxie Hart (Renee Zelleweger), dreaming of being a Jazz Lounge singer like Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), kills the man she's having an affair with when he crushes those dreams. Off to prison she goes, where she learns about ""Reciprocity"" w/ Mama Morton (FABULOUSLY played by Queen Latifah- I think she almost stole the whole show) and about how the ""6 Merry Muderesses"" came to Cook County in a wonderful rendition of ""The Cell Block Tango"".
Where's the guy? Lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) who Roxie imagines as only caring about ""Love"" but who really is a fast talking con artist with a law degree who can convince the press of anything (""They Both Reached for the Gun"") and ""Razzle Dazzle""'s the Audience- er Jury and Tap Dances around a ""tricky"" witness. Yes, Richard Gere taps and it's wonderful.
Don't forget to see ""Mr. Cellophane""- The number done by Roxie's husband Amos; Velma's ""Act of Desperation""; but of course the name on everyone's lips is going to be ""Roxie"".
It got sex and humor- isn't that all that anyone cares about in movies these days?  But, it really has so much more.  It's brining back the musical!  For people who liked Mulan Rouge- just remember that shows like Chicago have been on stage a long time.  Putting them on the screen is NOT an (as one review said) ""imitation"" of Mulan Rouge.  Chicago is fabulous.  If you're ""wary"" about it because it's a musical, rent it or watch it with someone who IS a musical person first, but I promise you'll want it when you see it.

1477953,5,B00005JLSE,"I am not a movie critic, but I believe that a movie needs a star for entertaining, another for a deeply developed theme, one more for artistic skills, a fourth for great performances, and a final for a great coordination of the parts.  This five star movie will definitely keep you out of the day to day life, giving fun to the spectator. Based on a hard theme, where crime and corruption are the central focus of the scheme, the artistic development of the film transforms it into an exiting drama, where the performances got a great level of achievement. The women in the film, actresses, singers and dancers, were all simply extraordinary, and the climate created by the artistic directors was very delicate, and elaborated, making beautiful refferences to criminal attitudes and antisocial behaviors.
About the direction, all I can say is that Rob Marshall did a great job, placing all the parts of the movie all so well together, and giving the movie a great and complex binding between the musical format and the screen.",1048550400,,1026,4.796610169491525
