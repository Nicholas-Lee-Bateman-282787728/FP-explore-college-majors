5146101,3,B008BJTMS8,Material was interesting but brief. I guess there wasn't enough actionable steps I could take to do a better job managing my mental game.,1356480000,,137,4.75
8526604,5,B008BJTMS8,Very clear and concise instruction that shows how the mind can interfere not necessarily for the good in playing sports and can be related to many other activities in life,1492560000,,171,4.733333333333333
8526605,4,B008BJTMS8,"I thought I was ordering a copy of the original telecasts from the '70s, and this is what I got instead. ts nice but it isn't what I was expecting.",1438992000,,147,3.933333333333333
8526606,5,B008BJTMS8,wife already had it as a paperback and now she can have more access to the information more readily.,1407024000,,100,4.315789473684211
8526607,2,B008BJTMS8,"This is a great technique for someone just starting off in tennis, but not skill enhancing for those who are rated intermediate and above.  Good timeing exercise with 'bounce, hit' and basic relaxation to release mental barriers, but it should be labeled on the cover as a beginners guide.",1398643200,,289,4.8979591836734695
8526608,4,B008BJTMS8,"For the theory on what the process is, the book is much better.  The video is more a visual record of the techniques Gallwey uses with a student who has never played tennis before, which is very amazing. Or maybe I should say lack of classical technique?

Tim Gallwey is amazing in what he has created.  The DVD is still a good addition to the research of sports psychology just to see Gallwey's techniques in action.",1388793600,,417,4.4605263157894735
8526609,5,B008BJTMS8,This was a great video. My son watched this in preparation for tennis try-outs. I felt that he was getting the wisdom of a seasoned coach.,1377475200,,138,4.346153846153846
8526610,3,B008BJTMS8,"The guy who was giving the lesson was just too old.  In his prime I'm sure he was a top instructor, but father time got up to him.  I don't mean to be cruel or insensitive just honest.  The girl getting the lesson made up for him (she was hot).  It wasn't that bad, but it could of been better.",1373241600,,294,3.85
8526611,1,B008BJTMS8,Received the wrong item so io can't comment.  Wish that I could have evaluated the disk because I wanted to see it,1371340800,,114,4.181818181818182
8526612,5,B008BJTMS8,Lack of instruction allows us a chance to feel the game. Developing a feeling for the motion in the game is done through awareness which helps to automatically improve our game without have to fall prey to the seduction of lecturing conceptual instructions. This goes well with the much greater depth in the book.,1361577600,,313,4.814814814814815
8526613,1,B008BJTMS8,Received the wrong DVD. Received the Inner Game of Tennis and returned it. Waiting to hopefully have the correct DVD sent to me.,1359504000,2,128,4.608695652173913
