Ringo Lam is known for making pretty brutal action movies, perhaps best illustrated by Full Contact, which he made one year later and has been one of my five favorite movies from anyone ever for 10 years.  But, in this one he worked with Sammo Hung!  A true master of the action-comedy genre, it was great to see Sammo in a Ringo Lam film.  A lot of great action and just a great looking dark movie.

The dvd was pretty simple but actually pretty nice.  Widescreen but not anamorphic.  English subtitles worked great, and the occasional hilarious typo is all part of the fun.  One trailer on the disk, for the film.",1356912000,,753,4.398550724637682
