4498535,5,B004XZ998M,"This is very similar to the first Christmas Lights DVD - same format and similar music styles. You have a choice of Jazzy instrumental Christmas music (think Charlie Brown style) or instrumental country (mandolin, Smokey mountain style). The music however, is new and not the same as on the first DVD. The music is well done and sounds great on the speaker system (rich, not 'tinny'). The houses featured on this one do in fact have more lights, bigger displays, etc... One thing that is different is on the first DVD there is snow on the ground which looks great. No snow on the ground, that I could see, on this one. Either one or both are definitely worth getting. These are great to have playing while putting up Christmas decorations, baking cookies, at a party or if you just want to see some pretty lights without getting in your car. They also automatically loop so they will play over and over until you hit the stop button. Picture quality on the DVD is quite good. I play it on a 50"" TV and it looks great. I would imagine the Blue Ray is even better. Enjoy!",1324944000,8,1069,4.431472081218274
4498536,5,B004XZ998M,"This DVD is very nicely produced.  Great footage, and well composed music in the style of Charlie Brown...  It'll be a great dvd to have on at my holiday work party coming up!",1323734400,3,175,4.2727272727272725
4498537,5,B004XZ998M,"I bought the first volume of this series. This one is just like the title says ""Bigger Dazzling Displays"". I'm playing it at my party this year.",1321401600,10,144,4.37037037037037
4498548,2,B004XZ998M,"The lights on the houses are great, but the music is lousy. If the music was more traditional and more lively it would have more stars.",1357257600,,135,4.230769230769231
4498549,5,B004XZ998M,Very entertaining and enjoyable dvd to watch and relax. Plenty of christmas lights and decorations with nice music background to enjoy.,1356220800,2,135,5.476190476190476
4498550,3,B004XZ998M,"Not what I expected.  The picture quality is not very good.  The music is mildly jazzy and mildly country.  Rhythms are upbeat, but annoying.  The same songs are on the country version and the jazz version.  Nothing sophisticated here.  I probably would have loved this as a kid.  It might be cute at a 50's-themed party.",1354924800,,321,4.625
4498551,1,B004XZ998M,"Really dissapointing, Loud, over done, nerve wracking. I generally like over the top Christmas dvds, but not this one. Options for Country or jazz xmas music, but no option for tradtional sound track. I liked the one I purchased last year, Christmas Lights Small Town USA . sweet, traditional, thoughtful.",1354752000,,305,5.12
4498552,5,B004XZ998M,Bought this to play in our atrium area.  Our customers can view in when they come in.  We get a lot of positive comments about it. The children love to watch it.,1354752000,2,161,4.0
4498553,3,B004XZ998M,"I watched a few samples of the Christmas lights footage online before buying so I pretty much knew ahead of time that I was going to love it - and I do! Except that as a 1080p purist I was expecting picture quality that was crisp and striking and would show off my TV. Unfortunately it looked about the same as any regular DVD. Very soft, not a lot of detail. Still beautiful - don't get me wrong - but I must admit I was pretty disappointed. It was such a great opportunity to have all those colorful lights illuminate the screen, but the softness and lack of sharpness makes it look out of date.

There are two options of music, Jazz or Country, both are simple renditions of yuletide classics and sound elevator enough. I'll probably keep it on mute and just play my own Christmas playlist, but there's certainly nothing bad about the music itself.

OVERALL: 5-star idea and a toast to the people who created and found those dazzling displays, but only 2-stars for the DVD-grade picture quality on Blu Ray. Hopefully they'll make another one that's actually shot with a good camera and properly transferred!",1354060800,3,1110,4.57286432160804
4498554,4,B004XZ998M,Looks to be a Christmas season favorite to help get one in the mood. It's amazing to see what some people will do to celebrate the season.,1351641600,2,138,4.148148148148148
4498555,5,B004XZ998M,"Let me just get in line with everyone else who loves this DVD. I am so happy I bought it. I plan to have it on as background during a holiday dinner and I just know that everyone will love it. Bright, beautiful scenes with ""jazzy"" music just puts you in a ""glowing"" mood. The price is so fair that everyone should grab a copy. I bought the first edition and then immediately saw that there was this one. Go with Christmas Lights 2 as the first one pales in comparison to this one. I can't imagine what edition #3 would look like but I'd probably buy that one too. Also love the music..jazz or country you can take your pick it just is perfect. Happy Holidays!",1351468800,4,659,4.196850393700787
4498556,5,B004XZ998M,"The choices of music are excellent.  I enjoyed Christmas Lights 1 and enjoyed this one even more.  The joy of sitting in a nice warm home, instead of freezing in a car out trying to find the best lights in the worst of weather.  nicely done.",1325721600,4,241,4.195652173913044
4498557,5,B004XZ998M,"Lots of bang for the buck.  As far as the jazzy music, its alright.  The video made for a nice background screne.  Not sure you could sit down to watch this from start to finish.  But, great when coming and going, while getting Christmas meals ready and all.",1325289600,4,258,4.3125
8447729,5,B004XZ998M,Fantastic great for parties and Christmas spirit. Quality is great!,1511740800,,67,5.8
8447730,5,B004XZ998M,Was even better than the first. Sets the mood in a creative way. You can get a lot of use out of these around the holidays. I looked up previews on youtube and they deliver exactly what they show. Love it!,1509753600,,205,4.024390243902439

8447733,4,B004XZ998M,"I'm seeing reviews on here wishing for a third volume of this series, which I agree with. The makers of this disc and the earlier one have a website where they advertise both, which suggests it might not be a here today/ gone tomorrow thing. But the only problem I have with this disc as well as the first volume is that they're each only an hour. Which isn't that good an idea for a DVD meant to be like those old ads for the VH-1 cable channel; ""Turn it on and leave it on"". Which is to say ""atmospheric"". Even if they don't come up with a Volume 3, they ought to offer a ""bundle"" disc that contains both this disc and the other, with a ""play all"" option. If I had the software I'd make one of those myself and archive both originals.",1447372800,,736,4.082758620689655

8447735,3,B004XZ998M,"This has some dazzling Xmas light displays. However, it looks like they took the video from just one city's very average looking middle class houses when I was expecting houses from all around the country along with some ritzy rich mansions (Palm Beach, Vail, Palm Springs perhaps?). Btw, you can buy both the #1 and #2 combo directly off their web site for just $14.95!",1419292800,,370,4.707692307692308
8447736,2,B004XZ998M,"Was expecting much better home Christmas light displays.  You can find more beautiful displays on YouTube. Don't waste your money, just drive around the neighborhood.",1389484800,,166,5.64
8447737,4,B004XZ998M,Another winning Christmas DVD. The light displays in this one are indeed bigger and terrific. You also get your choice again of soft jazz or country music to listen to. I was amazed by a lot of the displays. You will enjoy this.,1383264000,2,228,4.325581395348837
8447738,2,B004XZ998M,I didn't have high expectations but this DVD didn't meet them.  It was on the order of a bad home movie.  It went right into the giveaway pile.,1357776000,,143,4.071428571428571
