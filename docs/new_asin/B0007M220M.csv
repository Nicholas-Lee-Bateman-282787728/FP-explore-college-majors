8048745,5,B0007M220M,"How does one begin to write a review of a DVD of the greatest college basketball player in the History of the Atlantic Coast Conference, a conference that also produced Michael Jordan? What's even more incredible is the fact that David Thompson's college basketball career stands head-and-shoulders above anyone who ever played within the conference, to include Michael Jordan.  As this DVD relates, Thompson was the superstar of an NC State team that had a two-year record of 57-1, and whose only loss was to the greatest college basketball team in History, a UCLA team that was in the midst of an 88 game winning streak. Thompson's team avenged the UCLA loss with an NCAA semi-final tournament win, and went on to win the 1974 NCAA championship.  People forget that in winning the 1974 NCAA Championship, Thompson's NC State team snapped UCLA's string of seven straight.  As the unchallenged leader of that 1974 NC State team, Thompson was the focus superstar, while Michael Jordan was simply a freshman role player, who did not start for a large part of the season, but who happened to be fortunate to hit the winning shot in the 1982 NCAA Finals. James Worthy was the undisputed star of that 1982 North Carolina team. David Thompson would go on to become both an ABA and NBA star, ultimately becoming the NBA's highest paid player.  However, due to alcohol and drug problems, he ultimately short-changed what could have been an incredible career. Thompson is honest in talking about his problems and in warning younger people not to take the path that he had taken. His story can be a cautionary tale for up-and-coming superstars.  There are also a couple of complementary materials to this DVD, that can enhance one's understanding of David Thompson.  The first is a book called ""David Thompson: Skywalker"" by Sean Stormes and Marshall Terrill. This book spells out Thompson's greatness, and goes a long ways towards telling the full Thompson story.  The second item is a book called ""Reality's Pen: Reflections On Family, History & Culture"" by Thomas D. Rush.  There are 2 stories from within the book, ""The Legend Of David Thompson"" and ""One Incredible Human Being"" that gives one a clear idea of Thompson's greatness and his meaning to the people of North Carolina.  The book is filled with rich stories, many of them from the basketball world. All of these things together can help one to get a better grasp on the basketball career of David Thompson. His greatness was like cotton candy to a kid on a rainy day--it was gone too soon.  Still, he was wonderful to watch in the beauty of his greatness.",1422662400,2,2609,4.8165548098434

8048748,4,B0007M220M,"Pretty well done video.  Worth it if you want to see revolutionary player that most today don't know about --- who would be a superstar in today's game if he played now.  Glad someone recognized him and made this video.  Would have liked to have seen more amazing playing clips.  The interview segments with Walton, Jordan, etc. gave it relevance to today as well as credibility.  You come away from this one both amazed and sad --- what a spectacular player; what a shame he made some very poor personal choices that prevented him from becoming the complete legend of the game he could have become.  Especially because he comes across as a very modest and good person as well as being a team player --- in contrast to other 'legends' of the game in recent years.",1162425600,12,763,4.532846715328467
