3485168,5,B001B7CNXS,"Jericho Cane, a beaten down ex-cop, wakes up to another day, oblivious to the struggle that he soon must face. His job as a security specialist alongside his partner Chicago has become a tireless routine of seedy surveillance jobs, and since the death of his wife and child, everything in life which once held any meaning to him is now gone. Following a bizarre confrontation with a crazed homeless man warning him of impending doom, Cane rescues a young woman, Christine York from attackers who have invaded her home. He soon finds himself drawn into a heart stopping game of cat and mouse, as he realizes that she is the key to a supernatural force of terror, born of prophecy long ago foretold. For she is the unwitting object of desire of what deceptively appears to be just a man, but is in fact the ultimate embodiment of evil Satan. Now, as the world stands on the brink of the new millennium, it is up to Cane to protect Christine and all mankind from witnessing the end of days. End of Days is a great mix of horror, action, and supernatural elements. This is one movie you shouldn't miss.",1262476800,,1098,4.522613065326633
3485169,2,B001B7CNXS,"At least some of our greatest pornographic films have a more interesting storyline than this boring attempt at a religious action thriller.

Arnold Schwarzenegger will always have his name be synonymous with cheesy over the top action adventures. Some of them are absolutely perfect, such as Predator, Total Recall and those other ones where he's a robot but nobody seems to be able to remember. This is another action film in his hefty catalogue of shooty shooty action films, yet attempts to be a bit different from the rest by bringing Satan into the picture. Satan being about the only good part of this entire film makes me feel a bit blasphemous making that statement.

The story focuses around the millenium and Christine York from New York, get it? They do that joke in the movie too so don't take my lame joke as something original. The biggest part in history is about to break but Satan is ready to crash that party, but one thing stands in his way, Arny and his bulging masculinity. It turns out that satan isn't just turning up to be the venerable party pooper, he's looking for a wife and a bearer for his son to continue to the family line which will trigger the end of days. To do that he has to kill a lot of people who get in his way and torture the girl with visions before he comes face to face with her (God just sent angels).

Throughout the film we are forced to suffer some ridiculous word play and religious stories that some turn out to simply not be true. These are used to scare the viewer that a possible end of days may happen in reality, but it's not going to happen in the ways of Satan wanting some sex. Arnold is his usual self in regards to being all bang bang shoot 'em up, no caring attitude. He even has a go at beating satan with his fists. Priests play the usual righteous part about how faith in god will get us through, and we have to fight satan ourselves while god sits and watches the TV.

Possibly the only redeemable feature of the entire film is Gabriel Byrne as Satan. If ever you could cast a person as satan and you didn't have the money to get Al Pacino, Gabriel Byrne is the man to get for the role. He put across the pure evil image perfectly and at one point even had me soiling my pants. Other than that messy episode, this is a film chocked full of terrible clichs ridiculous cat and mouse chases and a pointless fight between a mortal and the most evil creation known to modern day religion.

I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if I had to I would probably recomment this to my enemies as I hate those guys.",1231977600,,2578,4.329192546583851
3485170,4,B001B7CNXS,"I was half expecting the Blu Ray version of End of Days to *suck* but suprisingly it is one of the best in terms of picture and sound transfers. I am only using a Samsung HD Ready LCD.

For a late 90's movies it has very good picture quality-:  during the night scenes, you don't see grains on the dark background. Sound is also superb. The only thing that *SUCKED* is the extras. Only a director's commentry, nothing else.

So if you are an Arnold Fan and hate 'extras' get EOD on Blu Ray :)",1231372800,3,492,4.157894736842105

3485172,5,B001B7CNXS,"Behind the films Schwarzenegger has done with direcor James Cameron(Terminator, Terminator 2, True Lies) this is Arnold's best action film. My only complaint about the movie is a pointless sex scene, but other  than that this film has action, special effects, even laughs.  Schwarzenegger turns in arguably his best performance in this movie,  instead of killing a hundred people and walking away unscaved his character  is scarred and sad. He also has lots of dialouge which makes his  performance even better. I don't understand why this wasn't a big hit, it  should have been.",951177600,11,579,5.1063829787234045

3485177,5,B001B7CNXS,"In my opinion this film has been hugely under-rated by many down the years, for me, it's a wildly entertaining
action-packed bundle of escapism.
The film is based on a fictitious 1000 year old prophecy....in 1979 a priest identifies a sign in the sky's having seen
a comet arching over the moon, upon checking he realises that it foretells the birth of a child destined to be the
mother of Satan's child and will conceive on the eve of New Year 1999.....The Vatican will seek to protect the child
from what is foretold will come.
20 years have past....'Satan' possesses a investment-banker played by 'Gabriel Byrne' at a restaurant he was dining in.
Former New-York Cop 'Jericho' (Arnold Shwartzenegger) who has struggled in life after the death of his wife and
daughter who were violently murdered by contract-killers, now works for a private security company, his partner
'Bobby Chicago' (Kevin Pollak)
Things are about to happen in the days leading up to New-Years-Eve, all-hell is about to break-out on the streets of
New York...'Jericho' and his partner find themselves heavily involved in the events that unfold....
Strange things are happening which 'Jericho' has to make sense of, because a priest had been involved in the violence 'Jericho' will look for answers at the church the priest had been involved with, he will question 'Father Kovak' (Rod Steiger) who speaks of the prophecy.
'Jericho' will have to track down the young woman 'Christine York' (Robbin Tunney) before 'Satan' in human-form
finds her and triggers what has been foretold as 'The End of Days'
How will 'Jericho' be able to protect 'Christine' from the power of the evil that seeks her to fulfil destiny...'Jericho'
will find the Devil has many disciples and indeed many converts all willing to die to ensure the prophecy comes to
pass....
As the hour draws near the struggle will become more intense, can 'Jericho' protect 'Christine' against the mounting
odds ?
The film is truly action packed with many superb visual-effects and stunts...well worth a re-visit or indeed a first viewing.
Good versus Evil an age-old battle.

3485195,2,B001B7CNXS,"It's Arnold Schwarzenegger versus the devil on the eve of the millennium.  There's no reason End of Days couldn't have been dumb fun--the script by Andrew Marlowe (Castle) doesn't take itself too seriously and director Peter Hyams has some talent for action.  But there's a difference between dumb and painfully idiotic and End of Days falls into the latter category too often to be worth a recommendation.

There are a lot of problems with End of Days but easily the biggest is the film's conception of the devil which is crude and one-dimensional and owes more to the terminator than to scripture or classical literature.  This unimaginative version of the devil largely robs the movie of an interesting villain and turns End of Days into an unusually dopey Schwarzenegger shoot 'em up where the big guy keeps shooting at Gabriel Byrne even though he is, you know, the devil, and has the power to instantly heal those persistent bullet wounds.

Gabriel Byrne is a fine actor but during the entire course of the movie he is given only one well-written scene--a moment where he actually gets to act like the devil and tempts Schwarzenegger's character with something that it is very difficult to refuse.  But even this one bright moment in an ocean of stupid isn't as effective as it could have been because we've already seen the devil kill numerous bystanders and several of his most devoted followers--and in most cases the violence was unmotivated--seeing all that weakens the devil's arguments about being misunderstood and takes away any real dramatic weight from Schwarzenegger's choice since this version of the devil wasn't likely to keep his part of the bargain anyway.

The basic premise in a nutshell is that the devil has to have sex with Robin Tunney before midnight of the new millennium (actually it has to be between eleven pm and midnight even though Rod Steiger claims it has nothing to do with eastern standard time).  Schwarzenegger has to stop the devil.  One group of priests wants to protect Tunney's character from the devil and another group wants to kill her before the devil can mate with her.

There are some half-way decent special effects but unless you don't mind movies that are aggressively idiotic that doesn't really matter much.  At times this reminded me of the 1970's drive-in classic Race With the Devil as Schwarzenegger and Tunney seem to run into Satan's minions wherever they turn--but Race With the Devil was good, dumb fun--End of Days is just dumb.",1408233600,,2495,4.888625592417061

So I decided to sit down and watch the entire movie. WOW WHAT A FILM!!!. Great story, great acting (yes acting) and non stop action from beginning to end. Easily Arnold's best movie. So having liked the edited film on network tv so much, I decided to order End Of Days on blu-ray disc from Amazon. Turns out the unedited version on blu-ray is so much better. Also the lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio on the blu-ray disc, is demo quality and will rattle the walls in your home theater. Awesome!!! I highly recommend that all you Arnold and action movie fans, order this outstanding film from Amazon.
