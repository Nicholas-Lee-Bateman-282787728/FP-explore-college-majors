However, at the end, it tried way to hard to not be cliche and ruined itself. (slight spoiler warning) The ending was disappointing for me. If you are a romantic such as I am, you will likely find the ending baffling and honestly kind of stupid. In my opinion, it ruined an otherwise good movie. I understand that it is meant to be realistic, but honestly I think this ending is less realistic than the ""cliche"" typical ending. I mean, how can all of these things in the movie take place and it still doesn't end like we thought? Also, the last scene was the worst part for me. That and the awkward high-five moment ( I mean, seriously? A bro high five?). All in all, this movie disappointed me on multiple levels by ending it in a way that tried too hard not to be cliche.",1488412800,,901,4.244186046511628
