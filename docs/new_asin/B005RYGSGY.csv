It's ok, but somehow I was expecting more from the staging (singing is fine).  Misplaced emphasis?  Well, why else get the video vs the audio?  Still, I see others liked it more so I'm probably odd man out.",1498608000,,340,4.508196721311475

8484406,5,B005RYGSGY,"I am writing this review as I listen to the most glorious operatic music ever.  No, do not get me wrong.  I love all opera.  But Vivaldi's Baroque is alive with a fierceness which the singers in this DVD, all previously unknown to me, express with an intensity that boggles the mind and the ear. Better than Spontini, Rossini and Martini (dry, on the rocks).  There are three Vivaldi operas right now on Amazon: GET THEM ALL!",1394150400,3,425,4.48051948051948
8484407,5,B005RYGSGY,"Antonio Vivaldi was one of the greatest composers of Venetian Style Baroque Opera. His vivid and dramatic opera writing is very apparent in the reconstructed score of Monazuma first given in Nov 14 1733 at the Teatro S. Angelo in Venice. He was a gifted composer and a most innovative instrumental composer having made many advances in the 500 or so concerti for various solo instruments he had written. He was less innovative in the field of opera composition tending to retain the three act Italian opera seria of the Venetian school for the most part and the older libretti of Zeno, Metastasio and others rather than the newer (Neopolitan) school used by the younger composers as Leo, Giocomelli and Hasse. By the time Monazuma was offered, the 55 year old Vivaldi's dominance in the operatic world was waning and the newer styles were becoming more popular. Vivaldi claimed to have written 95 opera  but he was given to exageration. We have libretti pages and fragments of music for some fifty with about twenty or so scores surviving in varying degrees of completeness. Two of these have received full productions of excellent quality and are available on DVDs. The first in 1990 is the marvelous tongue-in-cheek production by Piere Luigi Pizzi of ""Orlando Furioso"" with the inimitable Marilyn Horn and a great cast. This recording can be played time and time again without tiring. Then there is the beautiful and magical offering of ""Ercole su'l Termodonte"" (also a reconstruction)from the Spoletto Festival conducted as in the present recording by Alan Curtis.
The present recording is a reconstruction by Alessandro Ciccolini of an 18th century manuscript found after the Second World War in Kiev and returned to the Berlin Singakademie in 2002. Of the original 28 sections of the score only 17 survived, but this was enough to recapture the intense drama and emotional depth of the work. The present production is an awe inspiring clash of intense personalities and the magnificent music that brings them to life.
Baroque Opera is about singing. And singing is what you get in this great DVD. Yes the dramatic pulse slows so that the singers can show off their talent in conveying intense dramatic feeling by acurate florid vocal technique. And it is Monazuma himself who examplifies the pinnacle of this art form in Vito Priante. He is an imposing and regal figure of a man. He looks the part of a king and when he is present he commands the stage. His technique is impeccable in accurate execution and resounding dramatic intensity. It is a great pleasure to listen and experience his singing. His wife the queen Mitrena as done by Mary-Ellen Nesi is also spell-binding. Her arias are again intensely and dramatically presented. When she is carried aloft on the litter by her slaves she is a commanding regal presence. Her declamation and florid technique are tremendous. The daughter Teutile sung by Laura Cherici is also excellent as the love interest. She is involved with Ramiro, the brother of the Conquistador Fernando Cortez. Unfortunately the Spanish side of the drama is the weaker of the two vocally because the parts of Fernando Cortez, his brother Ramiro Cortez and the Aztec Commander Asprano were parts that were written for castrati with big, agile voices and a manly stance and stature. So much so that that in this production  the skinny, petite, light voiced ladies that take these parts even though they are good singers (especially the Asprano of Gemma Bertagnolli) do not quite fill the bill. However the music helps the drama along to a worthy climax (if you close your eyes). I loved it and recommend it highly.",1355443200,2,3645,4.915584415584416

8484409,5,B005RYGSGY,"In the glories of its first two centuries, from Monteverdi to Mozart! In the restoration and economic viability of the many historical opera stages of Europe, including the Teatro Municipale of Ferrara where this production of ""Motezuma"" was produced and recorded in Januray, 2008. In the vitality of smaller but bolder opera companies in Europe and North America: ""Motezuma"" had already been staged in Long Beach CA and Houston TX, as well as D&uuml;sseldorf and Rotterdam before the Ferrara. This same production, I believe, has been or will be produced in Lisbon, Piacenza, and Modena. Currently, the New York City Opera, which went broke in Lincoln Center, is preparing Telemann's Orfeo for performance in a smaller, more acoustically suitable venue. Small theaters, chamber orchestras, and smaller but more agile, expressive voices! I'm sure I'll elicit resentment by saying so, but ""all the best singers"" these days are committed to 17th and 18th Century ""historically informed"" vocal technique, and ""period"" instrument orchestras can no longer be spurned as novelties.

Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) credited himself with having composed 94 operas. Only about fifty have survived in whole or in part. ""Motezuma"" was presumed lost until a partial score was discovered in post-soviet Berlin in 2002. ""Motezuma"" was premiered at the Teatro Sant'Angelo in Venice in 1733. The original cast included a basso, two women singing women's roles, another woman singing 'en travesti', and two male sopranos - castrati - singing the most virtuosic parts of Fernando Cortez and the Aztec warrior Asprano. There was, of course, no chorus; Baroque opera made no use of choruses except in the form of ""tutti"" ensembles of the soloists. This production of ""Motezuma"" includes a ""tutti"" aria at mid-point and a celebratory chorus at its finale, sung by the principals apart from their dramatic roles.

There was no ""standard repertoire"" of operas in Vivaldi's era. There were no printed scores for the singers or instrumentalists. Nearly always, the composer himself was on hand, as the impresario and/or conductor. Such productions were inherently improvisations, dependent on the contingencies of the venue, the available instrumentalists and their skills, the cast of singers and their egos, censorship, and the 'taste' of the target audience. Rarely were two productions of any opera identical in music or libretto, though some librettos had an existence of their own and were set repeatedly by various composers. Arias were added, deleted, recomposed, borrowed, recycled, stolen. ""Pastiche"" -- the recombination of highlight arias from various sources to create a ""new"" opera -- was a common and highly popular practice. Orchestrations were universally ad hoc; obbligato parts were certainly the composer's work but the all-sustaining continuo was normally improvised/elaborated by the performers. Singers were expected to ornament and elaborate their arias much more freely and creatively than any singers of the 19th C would have dared. The cadenzas, for instance, that you'll hear at the ends of some of the arias in this performance are surely the 'creations' of the singers rather than written-out passages on any score.

It's true that the rediscovered ""Motezuma"" is lacking some some arias that are implied in the libretto, but that doesn't mean that the current production is ""incomplete"" ... not according to normal Baroque practices, anyway. It's complete when it sounds complete. Most of the recitativos have been supplied by conductor Alan Curtis and composer Alessandro Ciccolini; Baroque composers -- Monteverdi, Cavalli, Porpora, Handel -- often called upon others to provide recitativos. To my ears Curtis and Ciccolini have succeeded brilliantly; the recitativos here are concise, congruent musically and expressively with the arias that follow them, and superbly integrated with orchestral 'context'. Yes, most of the recitativos have orchestration. They are not ""secco"". Such elaborately accompanied recitativos would not have been the rule in the 1730s, but remember please that Antonio Vivaldi was the supreme master of instrumental color of his era. The instrumental portions of this opera -- the overture, the extended passages that open and close the arias, and the tumultuous obbligato instrumentations -- are expressive and innovative well beyond the rules. Even while the overall structure of the opera is utterly conservative -- recitativo/da capo aria/exit, one after another -- the music transcends the conventions. Lengthy secco recitativos would be out of place in the ""Motezuma"" that we have the rapture to hear today.

It's also true that Curtis and Ciccolini have borrowed arias from other Vivaldi operas to fill in for lost portions of this score. But then, Vivaldi himself recycled at least two of the arias he composed for this opera in later operas such as his ""Bajazet"". Of course! Why wouldn't he? Everybody did so, and continued to do so for another century. Rossini used every good passage he ever composed at least twice. All six of the singers in this cast of ""Motezuma"" have spectacular arias to sing -- showcase arias for their particular voices and vocal techniques -- and that's exactly what Vivaldi and his audiences would have demanded. ""Motezuma"" as we hear it on this CD is one tempestuous, flamboyant aria after another, adding up to an opera of extraordinary energy and drama. High octane!

What you hear is what it is. Baroque opera was never the sacrosanct product of a romantic genius. It was a community project then and it's a community project now. The previous review of this DVD, which gives it an insulting three stars, is extremely unfortunate. That reviewer, I fear, had little understanding of the conventions of Baroque opera and therefore little credibility in evaluating what Curtis and Ciccolini have contributed to this recording. He was correct, however, in singing the praises of the singers. The role of Motezuma is surely one of the most rewarding roles for a basso in all of Baroque opera, and Vito Priante sings it masterfully. Alto Mary-Ellen Nesi has the warmest and most pathetic arias to sing, and sings them with the sort of generous timbre that Marilyn Horne might have developed if she'd lived several decades later. Franziska Gottwald as Cortez and Gemma Bertagnolli as Asprano -- the two roles sung originally by castrato superstars Bilanzoni and Nicolini -- are privileged to sing the most dynamic arias, music that is as thrilling as any Vivaldi ever wrote. Che sprezzatura! It's hard to imagine that the castrati sang better than this! Laura Cherici as Teutile and Theodora Baka as Ramiro are equally proficient.

If some of the names of characters in this drama sound rather little like Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecas, don't be perplexed. Aside from the identities of Hernan Cortez and Moctezuma, nothing in this libretto has any factual basis. Frankly, the less you know about the Conquest of Mexico  -- the most astonishing military feat of all human history, and perhaps the most lamentable -- the easier it will be for you to follow the plot of Girolamo Giusti's libretto. It's not an obvious narrative. It begins in media res, with Motezuma already lamenting his defeat and with the romance between Motezuma's daughter and Cortez's brother previously contracted. It might not be a bad idea to read the synopsis in the DVD booklet before watching the opera.

Just as Vivaldi was the unexcelled master of instrumental color, in his operas as much as in his concerti, Alan Curtis is unexcelled in eliciting precise, well balanced, compact yet transparent performances from his ensembles. The orchestra in the pit for this performance might look small to Wagnerites but it's robust by baroque norms: nine violins, two violas, two cellos, double-bass, theorbo, two harpsichords, two oboes, two horns, trumpet, and bassoon. I didn't enjoy the privilege of playing that bassoon. I'm honestly envious. The bassoon part is expressive and virtuosic throughout, and I couldn't help but hear it even while listening intently to the arias. That shouldn't seem strange; Vivaldi wrote more concerti for bassoon than for any other instrument except the violin, and the bassoon players of his musical world, from Venice to Vienna, seem to have been unrivaled.

This staging is effective visually also. The costumes of the Aztecs are painterly: rich autumnal and earthy colors suggestive of mezzoamerican weavings. They bear no resemblance to what any Aztec ever wore, but this opera is not a portrayal of authentic cultural conflict. The set makes subtle reference to the religious themes that might have been prominent in the minds of 18th C Italians; a sacrificial platform, suggestive of an Aztec pyramid, is eventually hoisted into a looming Cross, but the opera merely declares the Conversion incidentally. It's an utterly human conflict, Cortez and Motezuma mano a mano. The conquistadores are clad in black and white, with proper historical breastplates and helmets. Cort&egrave;s marched on Tenochtitlan in 1519, by the way, with fifteen horsemen and six hundred foot soldiers, some of whom were really musicians, shawm and trombone players. His most potent weapon was small pox, as Giusti's libretto interestingly notes.

""Motezuma"" is a passionate, turbulent opera from beginning to end, without a lull. I can't imagine not being thrilled by it. And wonder of wonders, there are now three impressive DVDs of Vivaldi operas, the decades-old San Francisco Opera production of ""Orlando Furioso"" championed by Marilyn Horne, this ""Motezuma"", and the Spoleto Festival's ""Ercole sul'Termondonte"" also conducted by Alan Curtis. Vivaldi's operas, unlike most 19th C masterworks, are richly enjoyable merely as music, and currently about half of his forty-some operas have been released on CDs. My favorite among those CDs is ""Bajazet"", conducted by Fabio Biondi. A 3-CD recording of ""Motezuma"" is available, with Curtis conducting a different orchestra and a different cast of singers.",1325808000,7,10064,5.288305190744215
8484410,3,B005RYGSGY,"Despite fabulous singing by all 6 members of the cast, Alessandro Ciccolini's reconstruction of this ""lost"" Vivaldi opera is less than satisfying.  Only 17 of the opera's 28 original pieces survive; I have to wonder if, among the missing numbers, there were settings for chorus, as the contrast & conflict between conquistadors & Aztecs would naturally have made for some thrilling religious & martial choral music.

What remains of the score is chorus-free, a series of dramatically unlikely & unconvincing confrontations between the 2 Cortes brothers, Motezuma, his wife & daughter, & an Aztec general.  The music, mostly formulaic Vivaldi, seldom approaches the vibrancy or poignancy of the composer at his best.  No help comes from conductor Alan Curtis who, no musical Dr. Frankenstein, fails to create the sharp attacks & energetic rhythms that could have breathed a semblance of life into this long-buried, fragmentary operatic carcass.

The minimal, abstract set also detracts from the production's impact (the theatre's entire ground floor is also used as part of the ""set"").  There is no sense of the spectacle that would have formed a backdrop to this historic clash of cultures. The costumes, at least, suggest that the events on stage are set in Mexico in the early 16th century; there's none of the ""updating"" so unfortunately prevalent in today's operatic productions.  For this, I guess, we should be grateful.",1318464000,20,1426,5.228070175438597
