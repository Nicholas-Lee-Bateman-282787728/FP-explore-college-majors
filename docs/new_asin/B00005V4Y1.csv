8078920,5,B00005V4Y1,"Volume 2 of Now and Then gets off to a harrowing start as Sara, a young American kidnapped by Hamdo's forces and repeatedly raped by one of his soldiers, takes revenge and then flees into the desert! Because the king obliterated many of his own forces in a recent battle, he sends out his remaining troops to forcefully draft men from the surrounding villages. Add to that women to impregnate! Shu revolts against this and is thrown back into the dungeon, where his fate may be sealed, unless one of his fellow soldiers helps him out! After all, he still has to rescue Lala-Ru!

This anime is beginning to hold a rank with one of my favorite shows, The Twelve Kingdoms, in terms of character development and moral authority. There are people just like that mad king Hamdo, living and killing in our world. While his behavior is a little over the top and almost becomes comical at times, there's always a sense of menace, as if he might put a knife in you at any time. Shu and Sara are admirable characters even though one of them commits murder. What else could she do to escape from her captors? The tactics employed by the soldiers here are no different than any puppet force controlled by a tyrant that must rule by fear. The fact that all these horrible events are happening to children makes it doubly tragic. But Shu keeps on plugging away, keeping hope by his side, having faith that someone besides himself knows how messed up this world is. This show is very gritty, controversial, and for mature audiences, because of certain situations the children are put in. Great look at the darkness and beauty of the human spirit.",1122163200,,1630,4.582191780821918
8078921,5,B00005V4Y1,"I didn't think the second disc could top the first disc. I was wrong! It Blew Me Away. This series is really starting to grow on me even though I generally dislike depressing stories. Now and Then.., is one of the few anime series that made me vocally shout and cheer the characters on, as each of them fight to survive in a world of terrible atrocities. Nobody is free from a terrible fate when targeted by King Hamdo's army. Not men, women, or children. There's quite a lot of plot development in this volume and I can't wait to see how everything turns out in the end. What part will our hero Shu play in the ultimate fate of this war stricken world? And what will happen to the mysterious Lala Ru and her magical pendant? I'm eagerly waiting to watch the next disc.",1114214400,,769,4.310344827586207
8078922,5,B00005V4Y1,"Now and Then, Here and There is definately an all time great.  The movie starts a bit humorous, like any typical anime; however, it quickly moves the audience to a dark and depressing world.  By being torn from his own world, the main character Shu, is thrust into an alternate plane where oppression and war are law.  This story encapsulates overcoming the hate of evil, indifference, and fear.
The overall tone of this anime is a bit depressing.  The strong brutality and involvement of children is a bit moving.  However, the creator does a great job of reminding the audience, through the main character, of a 'light at the end of the tunnel'
The artwork and animation are both rather basic, but this doesn't take away from the delivery what so ever.  In fact, the basic and 'cartooney' appearance of this film seem to allow the creater to make better use of color and dialogue to deliver the story.  Also, the soundtrack is a definate winner.
Unlike some anime, the character development in this series is great.  Many lessons are learned as the characters are faced with fear and loss.  In the end, they have all matured from their starting point significantly.
Overall, this is a 5 star anime with a serious, yet entertaining movie.  The story is great and the message is brilliant.  Get the set or else you'll just be waiting to see what happens in the end.",1027123200,,1365,4.645833333333333
8078923,5,B00005V4Y1,"..And I don't mean the new film by that name.  It is much more reminicent of the 1960's movie version of the great H.G. Wells time travel story, but animated in very fine style.  This 'Now & Then' is the second feature in the series and every bit as entertaining as the first.  While the first installment focused in on the characters Shu (from the present) & La La Rue (from the future), 'Flight & Fall' introduces us to Sara, who has been taken as a slave by a first-rate anime villan.  She escapes into the desert though where she is befriended by an assortment of renegades and - I don't want to give the ending away so I will leave it at that, but the story moves along at a good pace.  Animation quality, backgrounds and dubbing are all high quality and the extras on the DVD included more than I had expected.  They have storyboards, background sketches, an art gallery, a choice of English and Japanese subtitles, excellent Dolby Surround Sound and more.  If you like anime and science fiction, you can't go wrong with 'Now & Then, Here & There: flight & Fall!'",1016755200,2,1069,4.423469387755102
