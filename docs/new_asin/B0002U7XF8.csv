8031966,5,B0002U7XF8,"I first picked up Stretch for Life on VHS in 1989, at the recommendation of my chiropractor. THe first part is a vigorous, standing upper-body stretch. The second part is more relaxing floor stretches. Both parts help teach proper body alignment, posture, and breathing, as well as releasing tension throughout the entire body. What I really appreciate is that the workouts include neck stretches, and all the exercises are gentle on the neck, and spine. I highly recommend Stretch for Life, especially for anyone with neck or back problems.",1127001600,10,541,5.089887640449438
