8462403,3,B0058YPL20,You can watch this season on Netflix but it still hasn't come out on DVD. Netflix almost always waits until a season comes out on DVD before putting it on their site. The only other time I can think of something like this happening is King Of The Hill's later seasons. They never put the later seasons on DVD but they put them on Netflix.,1351123200,5,338,4.2153846153846155
