8649868,5,B00JDB4FHQ,"Christian Film producers Illustra Media has produced a film focused exclusively on God's great revelations to us: the physical grandeur and wonder of the earth and universe, and the enduring truth that fills the pages of the Bible. ""King of Creation: Meditations on God's Wisdom & Works"" is purely devotional in its message and purpose. This motivating new production combines beautiful cinematography, heart-warming orchestrated hymn music with soul-touching vocals, and inspiring Bible verses read aloud throughout. My wife and I sat down just last night to enjoy this awesome spirit-stirring worship experience, that focuses us on what life is truly about in worshipping our Lord God.

This 40 minute DVD is comprised of seven stand-alone meditations that each explores a specific facet of God's creation, character, and attributes, design to be the perfect antidote for the stress and pressures of today. The segments are titled: (1) Whiter than Snow, (2) Living Water, (3) A New Creation, (4) An Everlasting Sign, (5) The Heavens Declare, (6) Seek First His Kingdom, and (7) My Only Hope. I can see each short featured subject ideal for opening devotions for Bible Study or personal devotion time.

In review, this DVD immediately brought back memories of quiet times that I found in the past, alone in God's incredible and peaceful beauty of nature, taking in the wonderful majesty before our eyes and ears of the true splendor of stunning and delightfully scenic mountains, forests, deserts, brooks, waterfalls and sea shores, reflecting on the magnificence and promises of the Maker of heaven and earth. King of Creation does just that. I pray that you get a chance to get a copy of this outstanding devotional film production and share it with your family and friends, because you and they will be truly blessed by the experience.",1398038400,8,1839,5.126666666666667
