3915145,3,B002E2M5IC,"A sort of black comedy comprised of multiple vignettes rich in Judaica with ample synagogue chanting and Yiddish melodies throughout.  Seems to center on one man's multiple troubles as portrayed by humorous/troubled characters and interludes--some of which are simultaneously entertaining, ambigous and difficult to decipher.  Have to think more about this one.",1256428800,,361,5.923076923076923
3915146,3,B002E2M5IC,"Having not at all enjoyed the pointless violence of No Country for Old Men which no critics including the Academy behind the Oscars dared to admit was - well pointless! (as taken out of HC Andersen's 'The Emperors New Clothes') we went into this movie with limited expectations.

When the movie started off in Yiddish (with only Danish subtitles) not assisting non Danish speakers much we were not sure we were actually in the right cinema.... and when we realised we in fact were we were even more sceptical as to what to expect.

Without giving quite as much away as the earlier reviews I can just say the main characters life is depicted rather miserably - a loveless marriage, disfunctional kids with whom he shares little, a workplace where he does not seem respected, and an autistic brother staying in his home .... and knowing the Coens we were just awaiting that he would crack and slaughter everyone one by one.... lets just say he does remarkably well keeping his cool and his challenges are actually very funny. His delivery of his character is excellent and despite the relatively slow pace you are entertained all the way through.

Being a great lover of movies 'with a message' I must agree with earlier reviews that this one does hold one, and challenges the viewer to think; A bit - but no more - unless your aim with movie reviews is to over analyse and see sublimilal messages behind every line and scene.

Enough said - a fine little movie that keeps you entertained and makes you think - a bit - which is reason enough to see it. If you are among those who could find deepness and sophistication in No Country for Old Men I am sure this movie will change your life forever.",1256342400,,1694,4.5442622950819676
3915147,5,B002E2M5IC,"A great movie, a great statement about human life -- the best Coen Bros. film to date and a true masterpiece.  Life is completely inexplicable, kind and cruel at turns, without warning or reason.  The only thing we have are the small pleasures given to us, and to want, and to look for someone to love ---- though no guarantee about finding such a person. The film closes with an oncoming tornado, a whirling black cloud that seems to signify the violent mystery that is human life.  The film opens with the following quotation from the writings of a medieval French rabbi: ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" Possible or impossible? This movie is one beautiful, perfectly made, and profound creation.  Plus, it's really funny.",1255824000,45,749,4.874015748031496
3915148,5,B002E2M5IC,"For college physics professor Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), life is falling apart. For seemingly no reason, his wife wants to divorce him and be with his colleague. His children have no respect for him; the son steals money to support a marijuana habit and the daughter steals money to save up for a nose job. His brother has little to no social skills, and because he lacks the ability to take care of himself, he lives in Larry's house. At school, the father of a South Korean exchange student is threatening to sue, which is awkward since the student may or may not have bribed Larry for a better grade. He's up for tenure, yet the impending divorce and a property dispute with his neighbor has him up to his neck in legal fees. It seems the only good thing he has going for him is attending his son's bar mitzvah.

We expect quirkiness from a Coen Brothers' film. We might even expect bleakness. ""A Serious Man"" gives us all that, and then goes one step further by being philosophically profound. Not profound in that boisterous, overstated way--in which a speech is made and everyone learns a valuable lesson--but in that silent, underhanded way, where theme, character, and plot reveal themselves slowly through carefully constructed symbols. Symbolism is tricky because you always run the risk of overdoing it; even wonderful films like ""Milk,"" ""Gran Torino,"" and ""W."" occasionally fell victim to obvious imagery. With ""A Serious Man,"" most of the symbolism is reserved for cleverly worded anecdotes, which paradoxically explain nothing. Larry is a faithful man, yet the rabbis he visits can't seem to give him decent spiritual advice. Then again, is it possible to find the answers on the outside when the problems are within?

Stuhlbarg is perfectly cast, playing Larry not as the raving comical figure one might expect from a man in his situation. Rather, he plays him as a quietly desperate man, someone who sees everything around him yet can't process how it has all gone wrong. The more he tries to understand the meaning of his life, the less he ultimately discovers. Why, for example, has his wife, Judith (Sari Wagner Lennick), never given any indication that their marriage was in trouble? Why does she want to be with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a man so phony and obnoxious that he should be hated on general principles? Why did Larry have to move into a motel when it would have been much easier for Judith to move in with Sy? Maybe the answers lie with the elusive Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell), who Larry has been having trouble making an appointment to see.

What this movie so brilliantly conveys is that paralyzing sense of being on your own in an unsympathetic world. This applies to the look as well as to the people; the Coen Brothers, who grew up in St. Louis Park, Minnesota during the 1960s, have faithfully recreated that time and place, pitting their protagonist against a frighteningly routine mid-twentieth century landscape of identical rambler homes and neatly manicured lawns. But the fact that Larry is having a hard time doesn't necessarily mean we nothing but sympathy for him; he thinks he can solve all his problems simply by visiting rabbis, when in fact they can only provide him with metaphorical observations and long-winded fables that don't really go anywhere. He seeks an insightful message when in fact there isn't one to give, save maybe for the lyrics of a Jefferson Airplane song.

Aside from Larry, the film's most engaging character is his brother, Arthur (Richard Kind), a man whose notebook of rambling mathematical formulas blurs the line between genius and insanity. He physically represents his social awkwardness: Overweight, tall, and perpetually hunched over, with a cyst on the back of his neck that he continuously drains with a special suction machine. He seems like a decent person at heart, although that doesn't mean he isn't capable of doing something wrong. There comes a point when he runs off half naked, crying like a five-year-old while ranting about how unfair God has been to him. He looks at Larry and sees not a miserable soul whose life is falling apart, but as someone who lucked out by getting married and having children. Is he right? I guess that depends on how you define being lucky.

Some audiences will not appreciate the ending, which symbolically makes it clear that virtually nothing has been resolved. We do, however, get a wonderful visual representation of a turning point, something the Coen Brothers are known for including in their films. It's an image that emphasizes more than life's unpredictability; it also emphasizes a new chapter in Larry's life, one we aren't meant to see but know will be just as challenging. One can only hope that he eventually finds the answers he has been looking for. ""A Serious Man"" is one of the year's best films--darkly funny and deeply introspective, deliberately paced and cleverly structured, strong in character, dialogue, and imagery. Some of its greatest images are of quirky subtleties, like carefully angled shots of Larry's facial expressions. If you were in his situation, your face would look the same way.",1254700800,12,5152,4.896907216494846
3915149,5,B002E2M5IC,"In one phrase, this film essentially (and also masterfully and gently - yes, gently, despite all that presumed drama on the screen) tells the viewer that all things in life are connected, but nothing really is what it may seem on the surface.
Beware, this is not a comedy, if only somewhat of a comedy Cohen style - at least I can't title it as such. If I define ""Burn After Reading"" as a dark comedy and social satire, this is rather a philosophical drama sprinkled with (very) dark humor, more of a spiritually charged glimpse at everyday people's reality, and I suspect that as such it may not appeal to a lot of people. Still, fans of Cohen's filmography and people who are interested in spiritual development may greatly enjoy it... I did, very much so.",1511222400,3,758,4.54014598540146

3915152,3,B002E2M5IC,"The actors were excellent. The main character was a nudnik. His wife never gave a reason for wanting a divorce, and the main character was too passive to do anything - positive or negative. He simply waited for problems to run their natural course without attempting to change anything. Maybe this is why his wife didn't like him.

There were good stories in between the main plot, although none were properly developed. The plot was a bit erratic. There is no rhyme or reason to why anything happened which might be the point of the movie.

The writers clearly lack an understanding of basic Jewish religious principles. For example, the details associated to the reading of the Torah was completely wrong - nobody says ""Adon Olam"" after being called to the reading of the Torah. The head rabbi is clearly running a Reformed Synagogue, yet he is dressed as an Orthodox Rabbi. I am convinced that they writers have never set foot in an Orthodox Synagogue nor spoken to an Orthodox Rabbi.

There is no ending to this movie. I wonder if it was intentional or if they ran out of money to finish the film. My guess is that, being two Jewish brothers, they had five different endings and no agreement on which one to select. I am not sure of what the writers were  trying to accomplish or what message, if any, was being conveyed.

3915162,4,B002E2M5IC,"Released in 2009 and written & directed by the Coen brothers, A Serious Man is a black comedy/drama/satire about a passive Minneapolis physics professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) in 1967 who faces a series of tragedies and desperately seeks the answers Why? Sari Lennick plays his unfaithful wife and Fred Melamed (who looks like Francis Ford Coppola) her lover. Richard Kind appears as the eccentric (maybe genius) uncle while Aaron Wolff & Jessica McManus play the kids. Amy Landecker is on hand as a sexpot neighbor. Simon Helberg (from The Big Bang Theory) has a small role as an assistant rabbi.

Theres a prologue that was shot in the Czech Republic which the Coens say has no link to the rest of the movie. Really? It struck me as rather tedious and, if it has no connection to the story, why is it there? Actually, I didn't find the entire first half of the film very entertaining and the protagonists ultra-passivism started to become exasperating, but around the halfway point things began to click and I found myself consistently amused till the end.

Freely borrowing from the awesome book of Job, this movie will obviously play better to Jewish and Christian audiences; perhaps also other spiritual seekers. It addresses the deep questions of life and the inherent challenges of the human condition (trapped in a physical shell in a fallen world while yearning for the perfect and divine) with a good sense of satirical humor. The song Somebody to Love by Jefferson Airplane is a focal point and supposedly holds the non-answers:

When the truth is found to be lies;
And all the joy within you dies.
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love.

There are anachronistic references to two albums: Santana's Abraxas and Creedence Clearwater Revival's Cosmo's Factory, which weren't released until 1970, three years after the events in the film.

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area (e.g. the suburban scenes were filmed in Bloomington), including St. Louis Park, where I spent my childhood.

3915176,5,B002E2M5IC,"This is a wonderfully semitic, not anti, and universal story in its theme of one man's search for God -- or Hashem, in this instance. Affable, mild-mannered, pretty passive, physics professor Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is being painfully visited by some Job-like sequelae, or he's wondering if they are, in fact, related to a flunking student's secreting a bribe among his papers. Then his rather histrionic wife Judith (Sari Lennick) reports that she wants a divorce and is having an emotional (so far) affair with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed). Smarmy Ableman won't stop commandeering Larry's body and mind -- hugging him tightly, grabbing his hands, insisting everything is just fine. All the while, Larry repeats that he hasn't done anything. Larry wrecks his car. He's up for tenure and someone's sabotaging him. And to add insult to injury, The Columbia Record Club is after him for unsolicited purchases. Of course it's time to seek rabbinical guidance. And there are three rabbis and a host of parables. The humor is omnipresent. It's in the deadpan delivery of hilarious lines, the contrast amplifying them; the closeup of Larry's moved-in-for-good repugnant brother Arthur (Richard Kind) noisily downing a carton of milk inches from his face in the wee hours; it's Judith reminding her daughter that Arthur hogs the bathroom to keep draining his sebaceous cyst --""you know that,"" she scolds. A dentist discovers a message in Hebrew inside a non-Jew's dentures, vaulting him into a God-seeking pilgrimage. The names of people discussed by the main characters, yes, are sort of hyper-Jewish to the absurd, even onomatopoeic. It feels in extremely good cultural fun. It's really okay to laugh at oneself. The directing by Joel and Ethan Coen and the camerawork by Roger Deakins are spectacular-- long shots, close ups: son Danny (Aaron Wolff)  running ahead, the pursuing bully not yet seen; the telescoping ladder arriving in anticipation of its climber; observing the dentist up close through his one lens as he scrutinizes his perceived message from God; the prolonged pregnant silence of Danny at the pulpit, the congregants' faces switching from pride to abject angst. The humor is that delicious dry type, both wonderfully subtle and complex, so reminiscent of the teamwork of Mike Nichols and Elaine May. The acting is top-shelf, Michael Stuhlbarg extraordinary.  Ellen Chenowith and Rachel Tenner know their casting.  The music is smartly congruent and full of range, from the stroke of a few keys, to the Jefferson Airplane, and circling back to a very somber sober Yiddish prayerful piece and again to the work of Carter Burwell. This is a great story (also the Coens) that suggests that much of life comes to us on its own, or Hashem's, terms and we must "" receive it with simplicity.""",1482796800,3,2805,5.093478260869565

No one else in his family or world possesses his attributes and they cause him untold troubles. There is humor and pathos in his effort to maintain his life.

3915228,5,B002E2M5IC,"I enjoyed the top ranked ""most helpful"" review of GP. It was a creative and likely accurate analysis of the story structure.

My focus tends to be on bottom lining the ultimate message of dramatic movies when I can. Though, this movie could certainly qualify as a black comedy, I'd qualify it as ""drama"" given the ending and overall story tone. And why else sit through a drama if not for the messaging? It is true that better artistic films tend to have interesting story structures. As GP points out, this one does. Mullholland drive is another example of an art film that could be enjoyed just so you can breath a satisfying ""ah-ha"" as you dissect the story structure (though most mere mortals will need Wikipedia to assist with that particular film).

For A Serious Man it is the fruit of the story arc that is most compelling, though the story structure is cerebrally interesting to a degree.

The ultimate message of A Serious Man, in my opinion, was figuratively written in large red spray-paint on the screen in the final scene.

My interpretation of that message is this: however relatively good or bad your life may be, it can and may continue to get worse with no end and possibly increasing intensity. Therefore, find someone to love and live for the moment rather than constantly over-worrying and focusing on damage control.

There may be convoluted or otherwise poetic ways of saying the same thing but, taking a cue from Coen's combination of symbolic and lyrical articulation of the message, I think that articulating this particular message best lends itself to simplicity.

I'm continuously impressed by the work of the Coen brothers. Their productions are consistently a cut above in terms of story and editing. One tends to always come away with the impression that they just watched enjoyable art as film, at least in comparison with the norm. I qualify it as ""enjoyable"" art because it is necessary to do so to separate it from the common vision of the stultifying art film.

A parting comment on a matter of interest: the short story in the beginning of the film stars Gopnik's ancestors. Their action caused a curse to be passed to Gopnik. What particular action precipitated that curse, dependent on whether or not the Rabbi was a Dybbuk or not, I will leave up to you to interpret.",1450828800,,2308,4.740648379052369

3915237,3,B002E2M5IC,"<SEMI-SPOILER ALERT> Not a review per se but a warning: I like a satisfying ending. This intriguing and excellently acted and directed movie does not provide one for you. At best, it instead provides hints and suggestions of eventual resolutions for you to piece together after an abrupt ending amid-story. Of course, the point of the movie is pointlessness, or seeming pointlessness, so how better to punctuate that than with a sudden ending before any plot line is fully resolved. Isn't that life? Too often yes. But that's why I want a good ending to my movies - there's enough misery and lack of resolution in real life. If movies were only about capturing real life, then may as well make a two hour movie of people sitting silently in a theatre watching a two hour movie.

It's clearly modeled on the book of Job - only its conclusions may be the reverse of the Bible's.  But then from its very first scene, the movie is poised on the knife-edge of doubt; and when the whirlwind finally speaks, it only cries about the truth being found to be lies (in the voice of Grace Slick).  In short, along with ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou?,"" this is one of the Coen's richest works - and it's impeccably acted and shot, to boot.",1439078400,11,835,4.473684210526316

3915264,5,B002E2M5IC,"Here is a movie that is gently hilarious (if that even be conceivable!) but in a loving and usually quite tenderly understated manner. In 1967 the father, Larry, of a middle class Jewish Midwestern (Minneapolis area) family, is an earnest man whom misfortune besets, often to considerable financial as well as personal worry, in terrible but cinematically humourous ways. His run of bad luck sets in at the movie's outset when Larry's wife Judith demands a ritual divorce to marry anew, to his frumpish colleague Sy, who is reputed to be ""a serious man"" (""really?"" the viewer cannot help but to ask himself), but who has been ""cattin' around"" with Judith.  Further along, among much, much else, occurs Larry's son Danny's bar mitzvah, in which the 13 year-old boy participates, in a dazed stupor, while ""stoned"" on marijuana. So it goes, through a miscellany of merriment (for the viewer, not for Larry) throughout this motion picture, right the very end (as the ever-earnest husband and father is informed that he just may have some dreadful ailment, the nature of which the film does not reveal as it draws thereupon to a very ""up-in-the-air"" conclusion. Larry's problems are, variously, marital and familial, professional, legal, financial, at times riotously physical, and so on -- and on. Well, at least things never are quite so awful as they are in the nightmares that plague Larry's sleep!

Nothing much of any of this resolves itself. What goes on in the film is to pile one peculiar incongruity upon more of the same for the entire length of it. I suppose that many viewers will find the movie baffling or mystifying. Certainly, it helps to be some kind of, or at least to be some degree of, Jewish to understand all of this, or otherwise to have other familiarity with Jewish culture and folkways. In my own case, I can say that it is partly due to the ""mischling"" nature of the step-family in which I grew up, exceedingly repressed partly-Jewish Protestants, among the more extended family which, back In Thuringia, collectively had renounced Judaism in the decade or so preceding the First World War, not long before most of them would start to migrate to North America. They essentially had become (albeit spottily) Lutherans, with the edges of their forbears' renounced Jewishness often popping out in their own behaviour and conversation in the most unexpected ways and places. That background makes me feel like some sort of partial insider to all of this Yiddish madness; I also possess (and have read and listened to) a quite large amount of documentation of and about Judaica, both printed and recorded, sacred and secular (among it, much in Hebrew and in Yiddish), among my personal collecton of books and 78 r.p.m. and LP sound recordings. I was the only one in the family, either of my own or of my step-father's generations, to understand German (because I studied it at university), so only I came to realise just how much of my step-grandmother's supposedly venerable German really was laced generously with Yiddish (which is not hard, in large part, for someone knowing High German to recognise and to understand upon hearing it). Some of my step-father's cousins, mistakenly proud of their presumdly ""pure"" German descent, spoke and read German in their homes and at their farms.

However, the DVD of ""A Serious Man"" presents one case where it is worth seeing its bonus features, not very lengthy ones but quite helpful, before viewing the film, the more so if one has little or no understanding of things Jewish. The potential viewer, however, should not worry unduly about these matters. There is so much fun along the way that anyone should be able to follow the movie's action with delight! That's enough from me, since the many other reviews on Amazon-U.S. and of Amazon-Canada go into further (and welcome) details about plot, philosophical underpinnings, and other aspects of this motion picture.",1426291200,,3931,4.926093514328809

3915272,2,B002E2M5IC,"I love Coen Brother movies, I love Michael Stuhlbarg.  So getting this movie for 49 cents was a no brainer... you get what you pay for.  There is no more deep thought that what ever will be will be (Que sera, sera).  It wasn't the Book of Job -there is a resolution, it wasn't Shroeder's Cat because this guy was doomed from the start.  He wouldn't pick his battles and when he did it was always the wrong one...$3000 in 1967 to save someone who would/should probably go to jail anyway, yet nothing for his home & family.  It just didn't make sense.  We are all going to die so whether his kid died in the tornado or whether he had cancer or not was beside the point.  Seeing the end of this gave me that Sophie's Choice moment when everybody was upset and thought her choice was between her son or daughter when in fact it was between life or death (living in the past or having a future) she of course chose death.

On the upside, technically it was fun to watch, with only minor anacronisms (someone has already pointed out Larry's rant to Columbia Record Club mentions music that wasn't produced until 1970) and again I love Michael Stuhlbarg and he is a joy to watch.  The kayak scene was classic Coen too.  I could possibly stretch this to 3 stars but it shouldn't require the stretch so I won't.

I imagine the Coen Brother laughing at the High Art reviews because they didn't finish the movie out of lack of money, interest or both.  There's a scene in an old movie with Tim Robbins & John Cusack called Tapehead (the beginning of MTV) where a music video taping goes to hell but it's the last film of this band before they died.

""Saturday Night"" is a great ""Gunsmoke"" episode that has you wondering for the first 49 minutes what, exactly, the point of the story is. Then, in the last minute, you learn. It's a shocker.

""A Serious Man"" is thematically similar, and has a similar shock ending. Lawrence Gopnik is a physics teacher who enjoys pointing out to his students that we don't -- and can't -- understand ""reality"". When he starts having problems (the worst of which is his wife's affair with a man he considered his friend), Gopnik starts wondering about The Meaning of Life -- in particular, whether God cares about us and how we behave. Gopnik has a strong sense of morality, and wonders why he hasn't been rewarded for his seriousness.

His questions lead him to discuss his problems with rabbis (sound familiar?), who have nothing insightful -- or merely useful -- to offer. By the end of the film, his problems seem resolved -- no thanks to his good behavior, or to the grace of God -- and he decides that how he leads his life doesn't matter in the big scheme of things. Needing money to pay his brother's legal fees, he obtains it by doing something he earlier said was immoral. And then...

""A Serious Man"" is one of those Coen films that a lot of critics just don't get, yet its point and purpose are obvious. I'm not a philosopher -- but I had no trouble understanding it.",1409184000,,1387,4.554216867469879

3915308,3,B002E2M5IC,"Its been 25 years since the Coen Brothers introduced their first indie classic, Blood Simple to
much critical acclaim. This weeks column covers some history of their work and their latest
offering.
Henry: Few filmmakers have the ability, as well as the opportunity, to make uniquely different
films on a regular basis. While most directors could be placed into one genre, Joel and Ethan
Coen have proven to be the exception to the rule. The brothers have created 14 films that span the
continuum from comedies (Raising Arizona, Intolerable Cruelty) to dark thrillers (No
Country for Old Men, Fargo). Each film has a distinct style and rhythm that could be
identified as a Coen brothers piece, but still stand on its own as an original.

Sims: It is exactly that style, writing, as well as their indie roots have long been an inspiration to
aspiring independent filmmakers everywhere (including myself) Fargo garnered the first Oscar
for the brothers who won for best screenplay in 1997, and there was no doubt as to why. They
were nominated for best direction but lost to The English Patient, which some still wonder why
(oh, please don't write me any nasty letters--just ask Elaine from Seinfeld!). They would gain
another nomination for the adaptation for another of their classics, O Brother, Where Art Thou,
but wouldnt again take home the Oscar until 2008 with their big win with No Country for Old
Men (best film, best direction, best writing).
Henry: Their latest film, A Serious Man takes place in 1967 and follows Larry Gopnik, an
angst-ridden Jewish professor. Gopniks life is crumbling around him; his wife is leaving him, his
children are having discipline issues and a student at his school is trying to bribe him. The parable
of the film asks the question  when a man is at the lowest point in his life, where should he turn?
The film is quirky (a good thing) and mixes humor with sadness as we witness a man who falling
apart. Michael Stuhlbarg stars as Gopnik and he plays the part wonderfully. In the end, it is not
exactly a feel-good movie, but that is the point.
Sims: Exactly. Not a typical Hollywood ending but most certainly fitting. Some may have other
Coen Brothers favorites, but this one is beautifully written with brilliant acting especially from
relative newcomer Stuhlbarg (another endearing trademark for the brothers to give a relative
newbie the chance), excellent cinematography, and great moments of depth that these two pull off
so well. Were looking forward to the next 25 years!",1408406400,,2517,4.878504672897196

3915314,5,B002E2M5IC,"This film is not for everyone, because the conclusions could be disturbing. The protagonist, Larry Gopnik, is searching for meaning and understanding in a world devoid of both. He is a ""serious man"" in a world that is anything but serious. The theme that wisdom and tradition are of no help runs through the film. Gopnik's brother, who appears to have solved the secret of chance through an abstruse calculation, is brought up on child molestation charges. Gopnik consults the younger rabbi, whose advice boils down to finding beauty in a parking lot. The older rabbi tells the story of ""the goy's teeth,"" where Hebrew letters spelling out the words ""help me"" are inscribed on the back of a man's incisors. In the end, this is a miraculous event for which the rabbi finds no meaning or explanation. The tantalizing prospect of meeting the old rabbi, Marshak, who apparently limits his visitors to boys on the eve of their Bar Mitzvah, turns out to be the dispensation of wisdom by quoting the lyrics of a Jefferson Airplane song.

The characters' lives are ruled by the capricious forces of chance, and if any overarching force for order is taking any interest, it is primarily harsh and swift judgment. At the moment when Larry decides to take the bribe to pass the Korean student, to pay for his brother's legal defense, the phone rings with his doctor calling with bad news. The film ends with an approaching tornado; as the students huddle in anticipation, the teacher fumbles with the keys to the shelter.

The wisdom of the wise is of no avail, tradition offers no guidance, and G-d, if He exists, is deliberately obscure. And if you attempt to take your fate into your own hands, you will be destroyed. This conclusion will be at odds with anyone who believes that the universe is ruled by a loving and just creator, who has our best interests in mind.",1402704000,2,1859,4.699386503067485

No, this isn't a violent, over-the-top blockbuster like No Country. It's a quiet but engaging film that explore man's relationship with God--from a Jewish perspective. And it's insanely funny!

You don't have to be a Jew to appreciate this film. The theme is universal. It's a 1960's version of the book of Job. It's lugubrious throughout. It's black humor, for sure, but it's guaranteed to make you laugh.

That's Kafkaesque.""--Frederick Karl

The Coens philosophical universe is an empty one, a meaningless one, they have no nuggets of wisdom or insights to offer, they have no coping strategy. To them, religion and philosophy and mathematics offer no real assistance, and even art is no real consolation.

When Larry Gopnik's life problems/stresses (unsatisifed wife whose met someone new, wife's new man who has the gall to offer him life advice, kids he doesn't understand, disgruntled S. Korean student sending letters to his dept chair undermining his shot at tenure, unstable brother whose own problems/stresses far outweigh his own) become too much for him to bear, he aks a young rabbi for advice, the rabbi just looks out the window at the parking lot and tells him what he needs is a new perspective, a perspective that will allow him to see the world differently but its completely up to Larry Gopnik to figure out how to adjust his perspective/his own perceptual antenna.

When Larry Gopnik asks an older rabbi for advice, the rabbi just tells him a long story about the futility of looking for answers or meaning. His advice seems to be that all we can do is get used to not knowing why the world is the way it is or why things happen the way they do.

All religion, (or art), has to offer are stories of other people's confusions that momentarily divert us from our own.

Larry Gopnik is happiest. most at ease, when he climbs up on his roof, adjusts his perceptual antenna, and allows himself to be diverted from his own life (by his sexy neighbor who sunbathes in the nude and who seems to live in a perpetual state of distraction aided by pop culture and recreational drugs).

That is all, the Coen Bros seem to be saying in this film that is a culmination and reflection upon their life's work thus far, that we can offer you.

Last scene (spoiler alert): I think the phone call that comes right after Larry Gopnik changes Clive's grade to a C-(which I love) could be interpreted to mean that there is order in the universe after all, and that everyone gets whats coming to them, but if the phone call means cancer and if the tornado touching down is meant to be the hand of God come down to take Larry's son, well thats a pretty harsh set of punishments for giving Clive a C-.

3915363,3,B002E2M5IC,"""Demanding at many parts to say the least but at least I can say that I have seen the Creating 1967 and Hebrew and Yiddish for the Goyim features on the DVD. A Serious Man is a twisty and quirky drama about a Minnesotan-Jewish professor who sees his life spiral down with his son, family, and encounters.

Larry Gopnik is our observer and victim of what goes and will go wrong and the film takes an often omnipresent and very philosophical nature of mental breakdowns intertwined with the complexities of one's relationship to their faith or religion. A purely Jewish film at heart that manages to take much of the tales (like in the beginning between the dybbuk and an emotionally-strung couple) and conversations about the work of Hashem and of the Torah; henceforth, there are not many like it out there.

While a lot is to be questioned about through its consistent metaphors is a good thing, the whole mood and feel of the film is quite difficult to pin-point out given its social-religious commentary, themes, and sparing environment where some characters appear and that is it (Ms. Samsky, Danny and Sarah Gopnik) and some scenes are just left to the imagination a bit too much. The Coens, as always, do employ their signature dark humour in the film by focusing on ironic situations through scenes that involve a confrontation, a fight, and a discussion of life.

This film is more held in its place and less overrated than No Country for Old Men but still suffers from perceivable aspects of plot and characterisation because of the philosophy behind its film's ready-for-discussion-at-the-end vibe.""",1363219200,,1609,4.864963503649635

The main character, Larry Gopnik, is in constant crisis from the myriad of troubles that placate his existence. Michael Stuhlbarg, who many have been able to enjoy recently in Lincoln and MIB3, perfectly encapsulates the feeling of loneliness and desperation. The film has a wicked sense of humor, and dares to to tread (at times) into the existential, which can be challenging but makes for a great conversation. Especially, when considering the film's meaning, one can watch the film many times and still not arrive at a safe conclusion, and this is the case without the film being avant-garde in anyway.

Michael Stuhlbarg does indeed offer a great performance as the lead-character Larry Gopnik but the other characters, except for one or two, are mainly caricatures bringing with it an artificial feel and predictability instead of a human feel and more realism.

There is throughout admirable subtle humor and there are really some hilarious situations - but also several unfortunate exaggerations.

Though the overall portrayal of jewish community and atmosphere is respectful and well done, the portrayal of rabbis in this movie is quite devaluating, even a disgrace, not at all realistic. And to what avail?
(Yes, it does help to erase one possibility of redemption.)

The cult status for `A Serious Man' is one that leaves me, well, a tad dumfounded.  I don't really see the massive appeal, despite actually really liking a few aspects of the film (namely, Michael Stuhlbarg's tremendous performance).

The film opens with a Jewish family killing a ghost and then moves right into a Jewish professor in 1967 Minnesota struggling with a slew of familial problems.  Yeah, I'm still trying to understand the point of the film's opening.  From there we learn of Professor Gopnik's wife's infidelity, his son's weed usage and his daughter's intentions for a nose job.  We learn of his brother's annoyance on others and the fact that he has not only a gambling problem but certain questionable activities.  We learn of his neighbor's apparent racism and their feud over land and we learn of his moral objections over a student's bribe.  All of this is well and fine except that Gopnik is such a push over that he's completely walked all over by everyone in his life to the point of paying for the funeral of his wife's lover.

Seriously.

I'm not saying that `A Serious Man' is a bad film, because it isn't, but it isn't a great one either.  If just doesn't say much, in my opinion, and the writing seems almost lazy in some respects, which may have actually been the intention.  The ambiguousness of the film's open and close (both of which seem a tad disjointed, the opening more than a tad actually) also hurt the film's overall appeal because it feels uneven and unfocused.  I'm not really quite sure WHAT the Coens wanted to say, so I'm not sure the film says anything at all.

People deal with their problems in their own way. The junior rabbi Scott suggests it is a matter of seeing things. Rabbi Nachter contends there doesn't have to be answers. The most senior rabbi Marshak seems to be still struggling with his own lifetime quest for truth.
If anything to be learned from this movie: life is full of problems, each of which needs a different answer. Some has a simple answer, some goes away with time, some needs compromise with our principles and some really has no answer.

3915394,5,B002E2M5IC,"- Might be the subtitle of this film.  The Coen brothers did it again, with another satiric masterpiece whose humor is dark, a virtual fart at a funeral.  No belly laughs, just ironic smiles and uneasy twitters as we watch the physics professor protagonist nail the equations of life on his chalkboard, while his own existence unravels and crumbles in one irrational assault on logic after another.  In an update of Job - without the triumph of faith and goodness - the puzzle cannot resolve itself until he takes action.  And as actions have consequences, the negative action produces the negative result.  Not to make a spoiler, but the cat dies.

The layout of the film was a perfect recreation of 1967.  Too ""1967,"" in fact, which the Coen Bros. did purposely to add surreal subtext. As those of us around then will recall, older architecture abounded and predominated as Federally-funded urban renewal was only just beginning. And plenty of second-hand cars made the streets a rolling open-air auto museum.

Not sure what the opening sequence in old Austrian Galicia added to the film, except to further the sense of reality's deception and false consciousness.

3915396,2,B002E2M5IC,"A lot of the reviews I'm reading that heap praises upon this movie seem to run on a simple principle: the only way you can dislike this movie is if you lack the intelligence to understand it. I'd like to take issue with that implication.

I read once that human beings tend to see ""faces"" in things (for example, the 'Man in the Moon') given even the slightest pattern to work with. A lot of people seem to be trying their darndest to make this movie make sense, completely rejecting the possibility that it just isn't that good of a movie.

Ironically, the movie itself seems to demonstrate the idea that it describes: there is no reason for things to be what they are; if life is awful, it's just awful, and there is no inherent meaning in it all. Our protagonist suffers insult after insult, never learns anything, never takes initiative, and when he finally makes a decision - right at the end of the movie, with his eraser - he is suddenly informed that, yes, it can always get worse. Then the movie ends. That's it. The protagonist, like the viewer, has just sat through a long, meaningless, painful series of unrelated events, sticking it out in hopes that they will have something to show for it all when the curtain comes down. I sat for an hour and forty minutes, watched a sadistically slow and unengaging movie, and walked away feeling depressed and cheated.

To put this another way: If one were to assemble the greatest chefs, give them the best ingredients, and let them cook while being stoned out of their minds, you would get the culinary equivalent of this movie, and some people would insist that it was great food, even if it tasted horrible.

Just because it makes no sense, that doesn't make it great art.",1312675200,8,1728,4.528846153846154

The short story in the beginning did not fit anywhere in the rest of the movie.  The whole movie was incoherent and very boring.  This movie would probably appeal more to people who understand the Jewish culture, and then perhaps get inside jokes and Jewish culture related references and verbiage.  For me it was cryptic with not a single funny moment in it.

Just one example: the dentist discovers some letters engraved in the back of each one of his patients teeth.  Well, even this story goes nowhere, and has no meaning whatsoever.  OK then, why is it there?

Another problem is that the movie is trying to connect any two completely unrelated events by the idea of ""actions have consequences"", and based on that support superstitious belief systems.  Well, *some* events are completely random and do not depend on your or my actions.  When Larry Gopnik changed the letter grade, he immediately gets a call that he has (presumably) a cancer.

The basic question of ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" is examined, dissected, and parodied beautifully here. In Job, God allows tragedy, disaster, and utter ruin to devastate Job, who happens to be one of the most righteous, upstanding men on Earth. Why? Because God is ""tempted"" by Satan to do so! Satan bets that Job will crack under enough pressure, and curse God. In other words, God allows Job's life to go down the toilet in order to prove that the devil is wrong. Of course, God knows the outcome before taking the bet, so Job is in good hands. Larry Gopnick is our modern, 1960s Job. He is stricken by divorce, terrible neighbors, death, and the Columbia record club! We watch as this physics professor's entire existence unravels around him. Will he crack? In Job, he is joined by three ""friends"" who mostly babble on about Job's apparent sinfulness in reference to his horrible predicament. In A SERIOUS MAN, the Coens use Rabbis. So, why do bad things happen to Larry Gopnick? I don't know. He doesn't know. Only God knows, and the result is comic genius,,,",1307750400,5,1169,4.545023696682464

While I was intrigued watching this film, which is very aggravating on purpose, I found myself wondering where it was going. It didn't take long before I realized it didn't have anywhere to go. After a pretty nonsensical beginning, we meet a Jewish man who is going through a rough spot in his life, problems at work, with his marriage, family members, religion and life in general. The ending is left open for a reason, how do you end this kind of film?...with an ambiguous open to self interpretation type of ending, that's how.

As you watch this poor guy go through lots of unpleasant and stressful situations(even the Columbia House Record Club scam seems a bigger problem because it's just piled on top of everything else), as we overhear a conversation with his Dr. over the phone, he learns at the very end of the film that he could have a serious illness and looking at the sky outside there's a good chance that his family and property could be in immediate and serious jeopardy!

The ending to me basically says, no matter how bad you think your life is, it could be worse.....much worse!

The ending does require an appreciation for the Jewish aversion to wrapping up something as complex as the human dilemma into a nice little package.

For me, it seems to be a film in search of a coherent plot, but maybe that is just me.

I think that this is a case of weak casting of the lead character (not his fault, he did was he was asked to do), and two brilliant film makers who reinforced each other's witty ideas and scene formation, all the while without a coherent plot.  Folie a deux?  In fact, perhaps if the characters were less subdued and more outrageous???  But that is me?

Now I do not wish to be all negative.
I enjoyed many parts of the film.
So many aspects of the film are outstanding.  The acting, the photography, the music, the scenes, many characters, many pieces of dialogue, (yes, I did enjoy many parts of it).  And when I watch certain scenes again, I find more to like.  Thanks to the miracle of the remove control, I can just jump from one scene to another.

The movie also is extremely open ended and obviously metaphorical but gives few answers to what these metaphors mean. Just like the fire at the end of Barton Fink, I have no clue what the Coen brothers are trying to convey. If you liked Fargo, Barton Fink or The Man Who Wasn't There this movie is definitely worth checking out.

Then again most of their movies only get better after repeated viewings.

This won't be everybody's cup of tea.

I do not know enough about this movie to offer an intellectual review. For instance, I do not know if this was derived from a novel and the Coen brothers simply mirrored the book (which I think they did in ""No Country""). I do know that this film is largely autobiographical reflecting the upbringing of the Coen brothers.

I'm Jewish and yet this was too Jewishy for me. If you are not Jewish, don't even waste your time with this. I interpret this as basically a ""book of Job"" situation where the main character gets continuosly dumped on. That's what the movie is about...a guy getting abused...from all angles...and then it just ends!

Since the movie had such a narrow focus, with no resolution, no climax, and no lessons to be learned... I found the movie to be a waste of time.

P.S.  There was one great scene that has an applicability to life. There's a scene where the main character (the guy getting thoroughly abused) is with his cousin and the cousin cries to the main character that he, HE has it so lucky because HE has such a good life.

Seriously the characters were barely introduced, and none were well rounded, except the lead, which was barely a rounded character.  The reason that I'm not giving this a 1 star is that I guess this is made for 9th English class, in some kind of silly allegory way.  I love movies with a subtext, but they should still be movies that can stand on their own first, then have another layer built in.  If I had known I wouldn't have watched it, or at least I wouldn't have finished it hoping for ANY kind of resolution at the end.  I'm fine with movies with an interpretive ending, but that would require a beginning and a middle of the movie that was remotely interesting and engaging.  This had none of these attributes.

But it is anything but a small movie. It is, arguably, the Cohen brother's most serious and personal movie to date. And I love it.

On the surface, A Serious Man is a story about a Jewish family and their everyday life in late 1960s Midwest USA. Marital problems, teenage behaviour, Bar Mitzvah, academic tenure, car crashes, unemployment, bribery, pot smoking, ""new liberties"", etc. But the underlying subjects are some of the greatest questions ever posed, such as:

* Is there a god?
* Are we ultimately responsible for our actions?
* Do actions have consequences?
* Will science ever provide a full understanding of the world or is it just math?
* Are Jews the chosen people?
* Is love all you need?

A Serious Man gets under your skin in a way that I haven't experienced for a very long time. It is both hilarious and extremely thought provoking; open to a host of different interpretations, very much like a full bodied Wagner opera, a true ""Gesamtkunstwerk"". The music plays beautifully into the action, the dialogue is delivered perfectly on cue so lines mesh like cog wheels.

You can watch this potential cult classic again and again and continue to find new details to savour. Enjoy concepts such as ""The Mentaculus"" (a probability map of the universe), the remarkable story about ""the goy's teeth"" and the truth about Schrdinger's cat. You'll meet some very interesting people and get their take on the meaning of life.

Yes there are some inspired moments here but on the whole this is a case of style over substance.

3915415,5,B002E2M5IC,"I had never heard of this 2009 Coen Brothers' film even though it was nominated for two Academy Awards - one for best film of the year and another for best writing.  That's why I am so glad it was available on my local cable station.  It's an offbeat dark comedy that seems to be a labor of love for the Coen Brothers as it's set in 1967 in a Jewish suburb of Minneapolis, much like the suburb of their childhood. There's a weird introduction set a century ago in Europe and filmed in Yiddish with English subtitles in which a couple lets an elderly man into their home who might be a dybbuk (an evil spirit).  It is only later that we realize that this dybbuk has cursed the future generations of that family with a whole series of rather comic misfortunes.  This story is, in effect, a modern interpretation of the Book of Job.  And it is only because of the Coen Brothers extreme talent in producing it that I found myself sometimes laughing out loud.

In a stunning performance Micheal Stahlberg is cast as Professor Larry Gopnik, a physics teacher who writes dozens of equations on the blackboard which his students find quite boring.  He's a poor soul who just can't seem to get anything right.  His wife wants a divorce, his children don't respect him, the man in his wife's life tries to befriend him, his lawyer can't help him, the rabbi and the dentist give him meaningless advice and no matter how hard he tries, life just keeps getting worse.  All this is told with restrained humor and pathos. I particularly loved the performance of the young Aaron Wolf who plays the part of his 13-year old son who gets stoned on his Bar Mitzvah day.

Throughout the film, there is a constant search for meaning.  And yet, perhaps, after all, there is no meaning.  This is the big question the film raises.  I loved it not only because made me smile;  I loved it because it made me think.",1287878400,3,1887,4.431884057971015

The answer that is finally given is from a rock song(if you even call it an answer) at the end of the film. I thought the movie was so layered with ambiguities that based on your own belief system you would come away with your own interpretation of  what they were trying to say. You could interpret this man as someone who does not want to cause waves or you could view him trying to be a serious Jewish man and doing what the good book says,""Love your enemy and love those who hurt you,which it seemed his wife and Sy and everyone else was doing. Was the tornado a freak weather storm, did his actions (changing the grade) cause it? So based on what your belief system is, you could say every action has a reaction,or every thing happens for a reason,or things just happen and their is no rhyme or reason why.
  I viewed the movie as being satire on belief systems. I felt The beginning of the movie was a spring board for the rest of the film. Your personal beliefs could sway your actions. For example the wife thought the man who was invited in her home was an evil spirit or demon. The Husband did not,so he was kind. Her belief system swayed her to stab him. The same thing applied with the serious man and how he dealt with his problems and why they were happening.

""A Serious Man"" has style to burn, and little substance.

During opening scenes, I wasn't caring about the paper-thin characters or the plot that could be summed up in one boring sentence fragment - bad things happen to a man the film's directors don't care about - rather I was obsessed with the fly-in-amber 1967-era suburb the Coens were able to recreate in what is obviously a low-budget film. The pristine, uniform, lawns, the blindingly white, crackless sidewalks, the vintage cars, the skyline absent of the crowns of mature trees, the spotless just-moved-in look of the homes, really do strike you. Sadly, the surface of this film is much more impressive than anything else going on onscreen.

Michael Stuhlbarg, a stage actor I've never seen in anything else, is poignant as Larry Gopnik, a married, suburban dad and physics professor experiencing a run of bad luck. In spite of the Coens' signature coldness and sadism, I actually cared about Larry. I fervently wished that he, and Stuhlbarg, were in a much better movie. The Coens' complete absence of investment in Larry leaves you, the viewer, free to laugh at the sadistic traps they set for him. I did laugh when Larry's torpedo-shaped wife brusquely demands a divorce, and when her lover forces a hug on Larry and presents him with a bottle of wine. Secondary characters were also amusing, often stereotypically so. There's the icebox frigid Korean student, with the incongruous name of Clive, and the comical rabbis. Rabbi Scott is eager as a bunny but too young and unsure; Rabbi Nachtner is older, arrogant, and all too sure of himself. The jokes are funny and, edited down, this could have been a rewarding thirty minute film. It's padded out, though, and the film goes well past the point where the Coens ran out of ideas. Fans struggle to apply meaning to the film's opening, a pointless excursion to a sort of low-budget, high school production of a shtetl tale the Coens invented themselves. The movie itself goes off the rails and starts dramatizing Larry's dreams, none of which has any point that hasn't already been made.

I think the real headscratching, slightly funny, slightly heartbreaking, slightly Ashkenazi fable around ""A Serious Man"" is not so much the film itself; the film itself is rather flimsy and shallow. Rather, what's noteworthy about this film is fan reaction to it. Read fan reviews: you must understand Schrodinger's Cat in order to understand this film! You must understand the Talmud to understand this film! You must understand a recently discovered, highly cryptic, 1905 email that Albert Einstein sent to Sholem Aleichem in order to understand this film! You get the idea. Hardcore Coen fans insist on seeing depth in what is a very shallow, half-baked movie. I suspect that these fans experience a movie the way some might experience doing a jigsaw puzzle while stoned and while working their way through the required reading list of an elite college for precocious, but troubled, boys.

Finally, the Book of Job, allegedly the inspiration for ""A Serious Man,"" is actually a magnificent work of literature. ""A Serious Man"" never so much as touches it.",1286755200,7,3695,4.926163723916533
3915418,1,B002E2M5IC,"HIAKU SUMMARY:
Why, Coen Brothers,
Would you do this to your great
filmic legacy?

Nothing is worse than an overrated film. Sure, a bad film is pretty bad. But a film that is rated much higher than it deserves certainly is worse in the sense that the film is hyped and has much potential but falters in its ability to deliver.

Maybe the Coens just set the bar too high with No Country. That film is untouchable, near flawless. That film was so brilliant that hell, even Fargo and The Big Lebowski, both excellent films, paled in comparison. Sure, Burn After Reading was bad (and they did have, I believe, one clunker before that, which was the hilariously awful Barton Fink), but this goes too far.

The only thing even remotely remarkable about the film is the ending, where the school is evacuated due to a tornado warning, and the film's final shot, of the young man watching the oncoming twister, a powerful moment. I'm not saying films have to have tornadoes in them to be good, I just expect a movie to be entertaining, even if it's poorly written. I can forgive a bad movie if its at least entertaining, but this isn't it.

The writing is awful. The dialogue seems to be written by an immature 14 year old. Mind you this is the same Coen Brothers that gave us No Country For Old Men, Fargo, Blood Simple, and The Man Who Wasn't There. The editing is sloppy; most of the film consists of people staring for a really long time without dialogue. Granted if you removed all the ""long stares"" this film would be about 45-50 minutes long. The characters are all just stereotypes of not just Jewish characters but characters we've seen before (mind you I'm part-Jewish). The acting wasn't too bad, a little wooden at times but I think they did good for the lousy film they had to work on.

As for getting a best picture nomination... when No Country won best picture in 2008, I was filled with joy, shouted ""YES"", and jumped up and down in happiness. This getting nominated for best picture??? Please, it's in the runnings with Transformers 2: Revenge of the Boring in terms of godawfulness (and I said the same thing about the equally awful ""The Hurt Locker"").

I've said it once and I'll say it again, people are sheep. That is the only way people like this crap enough to inflate its rating to 7.2/10 on IMDb. I'm sure the ""art house"" crowd will tell me how I'm wrong and how I don't get it. But simply put, this film is overrated, pretentious garbage. I thought ""Burn After Reading"" was bad but no, this film is awful.",1285632000,4,2523,4.473913043478261

3915421,2,B002E2M5IC,"Avoid this movie. It's the forgettable story of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor. It's meticulously set in 1967, for reasons made (somewhat) clear in the film.

Gopnik suffers a series of humiliations. His wife betrays him. Her lover mocks him. His lazy leech of a brother burdens him. A failing student tries to bribe him, and rudely confronts him when he rejects the bribe. His teenage children barely notice  when he gets kicked out of his house and moves to a cheap motel. Three rabbis do not offer him the solace that he desperately seeks. In fact, one of the rabbis confuses him by telling an absurd story that eats up a big chunk of the film. And the above list probably only covers about half of Gopnik's woes.

I don't blame the actors. They did their best with a very weak story, and some of the performances, including Stuhlbarg's, were impressive. Hence the two stars.

I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed five other Coen brothers films, so I know how talented they are. But they just do not deliver with this one.

Perhaps their goal here is to show us that life is unfair and that bad things happen to good, honest, and, yes, ""serious"" people. Bad things also happen to people like Gopnik, who, if you think about it, isn't really all that ""good."" The big problem is we knew all of this before we hit the play button. And the theme of good people suffering has been presented far more effectively elsewhere. Some reviewers have mentioned the Book of Job.",1282003200,5,1488,4.6
3915422,1,B002E2M5IC,"I liked many of the Coen Brothers previous films.  But like many other reviewers, I found this film to be extremely tedious in its trying to get to the point, which is never really made.  I understand that the theme of ""life can be miserable"" can make a great movie when done in an entertaining way.  This movie was not.

I do appreciate a good black comedy, but usually the point is made somewhere in the film.  Supposedly this is a ""slice of life"" kind of movie, but it is a miserable slice at that.  Sure many of the characters are quirky, but why should we care about any of them when they are largely dishonest and/or selfish?  Even, Larry Gopnik (the main character) is so feckless that you stop feeling any sympathy for his plight and really wish he would stand up for something, just once, and begin to show that he is a real man in charge of his own life.  No such luck.  You keep waiting for the emotional pay off, but it never comes.  Perhaps that is their point about life sometimes.  But then why should we care to watch and identify with this man's misery for 105 minutes when he doesn't seem to care enough himself?

There are too many loose ends left at the end, with only a foreboding ending scene to make you wonder how this movie could have ended better if the Coen's had really cared enough about their viewers.  It's as if they wrote, directed and produced this film solely for their own personal enjoyment, because there were too many inside jokes and Jewish references that only a select demographic of people could probably appreciate the supposed cleverness that they put into this film.  Perhaps the Coen's have now become too clever for their own good.  This is not for the majority of film-goers.  It can be difficult to watch.  I understand the concept of showing how life can appear to be just a random series of unconnected events.  But why do we want to immerse ourselves in those waters when those are the ones we as viewers are trying to escape from ourselves.  At least give us something more substantial that makes some sense and gives us a feeling that watching this film was worthwhile.

From the beginning sequence in Yiddish to the final tornado scene, no attempt is really made to join many of these scenes together.  Even the intriguing story sequence about the dentist and the ""Goy"" are left as a mystery in the end as to why they were placed into the film at all.  It seemed totally unrelated to the film.  What's the point?  Another inside joke?  Much is left unexplained.  And thus a rising feeling begins to grow stronger in you as a viewer as the movie plods on.  The kind of feeling you get when you realize that you have sat through this waste of time, wondering what other film you could have watched instead.  No movie magic here, just relentless misery, seemingly unrelated scenes and quirky but unlikeable characters.  However, you are finally relieved when you see the final tornado sequence (also seemingly unfinished) and not really caring anymore what becomes of any of the movie characters, just glad that it is finally over.  This is definitely not a ""feel good"" movie.  But if you like ""downers"" you are in for a treat.",1281225600,5,3180,4.526315789473684
3915423,5,B002E2M5IC,"A good man cannot be harmed . . . - Socrates

But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. - Jesus Christ

There are two ways to be a serious man in the manner in which the term is understood in this movie. One way is to be recognized by society as the kind of man who can reward his friends and punish his enemies, a man of consequence, a man to be taken seriously. The other way is to be in full possession of your soul. The eponymous hero of this movie, Larry Gopnik (a physics professor played with great skill by Michael Stuhlbarg) is of the second type. To the eyes of the world, he is a timid man of little consequence. But God, who sees all things, knows otherwise and sends him sorrows so that his soul might bear fruit.

His wife leaves him for another man who, while pretending to be his friend, is secretly conspiring to get Larry denied tenure at his college. One of his students tries to bribe him into giving him a passing grade and when Larry refuses, threatens a lawsuit. His troglodyte neighbor bullies him. His teenage children, being teenage children, can see his predicament and yet are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to give him the affection and companionship he needs. In desperation, Larry seeks out, in succession, the advise of three Rabbais. The first two try their best to help. The last, the wise Marshak who understands what is going on, offers silence.

What does Larry do? Instead of striking back, he simply absorbs the insults and cruelty. When his wife and her lover suggest he move out of his own house to a seedy motel, he quietly complies. He carries on with each situation by ascertaining the most civil, the most considerate response until, at the end of the film, things turn around and each burden resolves to a tolerably good conclusion, seemingly by itself. Mysteriously, God laid these burdens on Larry and, just as mysteriously, He lifted them. It was all for a purpose. The burdens could have been born with such grace only by a serious man. The trial is over.",1279756800,7,2092,4.440104166666667
3915424,5,B002E2M5IC,"I have always loved Cohen Bros movies.  And, this one is no exception.  This one has a comedy that's so understated that I was in hysterics from beginning to end.",1279670400,2,162,4.366666666666666
3915425,5,B002E2M5IC,"What makes this wry comedy special isn't the humour.  Although you'll have a smile on your face much of the time (certainly not at the ending), there were only a couple of laugh out loud moments.  Rather, it's the thought-provoking and stimulating storyline about a Jewish college professor, Larry Gopnik, whose life seems to be unraveling, and who seeks spiritual guidance in vain.

His wife is leaving him for another man.  His psychologically impaired brother has moved in, stirring up even more domestic turmoil.  He is up for tenure but someone has been sending anonymous letters of complaint about him to university officials.  He has to deal with a difficult Korean student, and the student's father, who offer to bribe him in exchange for a passing grade.  And he has money problems.

Gopnik comes across as something of a pathetic sap who could solve some of his problems by just standing up for himself, but his ultimate fate is apparently beyond his control.  The ending could have been written by Schopenhauer.  Even though I don't agree with, or like, the movie's message, I still respect and admire the way it has been put on film.

Aside from the fact that it probably helps to be Jewish (I'm not) when digesting the film, the only problem I have with it is that I kept waiting in vain to find out the significance of the film's beginning: a supernatural(?) scene in what appears to be 19h century Poland.  I don't know if I missed it, but I was unable to see any connection between this opening and the rest of the movie.

With all the garbage that is churned out by Hollywood nowadays, A SERIOUS MAN is a real gem of a flick, albeit an ultimately depressing one.",1277596800,38,1679,4.631756756756757

3915428,3,B002E2M5IC,"In their movie ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" the Coen brothers claimed the movie was inspired by Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" but rather than try to be faithful to Homer the Coen brothers just focused on making a fun and entertaining movie.  The Book of Job from the Hebrew Bible is all too apparent an inspiration for the Coen brothers' ""A Serious Man,"" but the various plot elements of ""A Serious Man"" are too scattered.  The movie concerns a college professor who ""has done nothing wrong"" -- he is not inspiring but he is competent, he is not loving but he is faithful, he is not great but he is honest.  He manages to get by, and he closes to his mind to the rest of the world, and that could well be the reason why his world is falling apart around him:  his wife cheats on him and considers him at fault, his Korean student tries to bribe him and then insists he is in the wrong, and his neighbor infringes on his property and when he complains menaces him.  Wherever he goes this timid and frail college professor cannot find help:  his lawyer dies of a heart attack in front of him, his rabbis mutter nonsense to him, his brother is even more helpless than him, and he's plagued by nightmares as he tries stoically to get by.  As his life spirals out of control, he keeps on chanting to himself and to others:  ""I have done nothing wrong.""  When, at last, he thinks his life is put right, new bigger disasters appear on the horizon.

I really didn't understand the movie, and maybe it's because I'm not Jewish and attuned to all that Jewish wisdom and stories ingrained and inherent in the religion.  But something also tells me that the Coen brothers here are playing a game.  As they play God and put their protagonist through a series of random punishments and dare him to find meaning and reason in them, they're also daring us to find meaning and reason in the chaos and randomness of this movie.  Just as the physics college professor, who's believed all his life that there's an intricate logic to the universe that can be explained by mathematics, discovers there's no meaning to things and that he ought to just accept, we must also learn to accept that there may be no logic to a Coen brothers' film -- you either enjoy it or you do not.

But this isn't an action film - it's a philosophical debate over why God permits bad things to happen to decent people and what we should do. Is the Holy One testing our loyalty? Maybe dumping trials on us to force us into a corner where we must choose goodness or evil? Or is it just a random, godless world? Who knows?

apparent dramaturgical error.  The wife stabs a learned rabbi, thinking he is a dybbuk because she heard from
her cousin that this man had actually died 3 years ago.  A dybbuk however is a living person who has been possessed
by the spirit of a dead person.  Its physical appearance is that of the living one, not the dead one, so it is not
possible for the rabbi to be a dybbuk in the way that the wife thinks he is.  Of course, we can interpret that the
wife herself misunderstands or does not know the distinction between a dybbuk and a ghost or revenant.

This is only a minor quibble.  The movie manages to be bleak and hilarious at the same time, in truly Kafkaesque
fashion.  I highly recommend it.",1275696000,10,811,4.389261744966443
3915431,5,B002E2M5IC,"""A Serious Man"" is a seriously underrated gem of a film. This tale of lessons in acceptance is told through the adventures of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a middle-aged, middle class Jewish everyman who tries to do well by everybody but who is perpetually dumped on by family, friends and colleagues, no matter how hard he tries to please them. But no matter how dark the clouds, there always seems to be a silver lining, too -- that is, until another dark cloud comes along.

Set in the Minneapolis suburbs in the 1960s, the film is a great period piece as well, full of lots of pop culture references of the time and a great soundtrack. The Coen Brothers have written and directed a great flick here, peppered with wry wit and all the usual quirkiness typical of their signature style.

The film was praised by many critics and earned an Oscar nod for best picture, though it deserved far more accolades than it received.  Thankfully, now that it's on DVD, it has a chance to reach a wider audience -- one that I hope truly appreciates this movie for the great piece of filmmaking that it truly is.",1275436800,3,1105,4.542713567839196
3915432,4,B002E2M5IC,"""The Serious Man"" is the Coen brothers' reflection on the state of modern Judaism, in which the protagonist, a professor of quantum mechanics who lectures incessantly on the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, is subjected to a series of Jobian trials.  The film is similar to Archibald Macleish's ""JB"" in this regard, as an atheistic challenge of the Biblical parable, only with a much darker tone.  The story is about the emergence of mid western American Jews from the insulated cloister of the traditional Jewish community, with a stinging rebuke to those traditions, especially to rabbis.  I felt that the movie wove interesting web of subtext, symbolism, and meaning, but crucially, failed to entertain much and is probably only of interest to ""serious"" Jews.

  The story follows the family of Larry Gopnick(principally himself and his son).  Larry faces a number of life trials.  His wife has fallen for a family friend and asks for a divorce.  He is bribed by a Korean student and his father.  The situation compounds itself, as he is involved in a car wreck and incurs lawyers' fees.  Meanwhile, Larry's 13yo son lethargically attends Hebrew school in preparation for his rite of passage.  He must deal with a school bully and a rabbi who confiscates his transistor radio.

  Larry, in a state of existential crisis, seeks the spiritual guidance of three successive rabbis.  The first is younger than Larry himself, and seems fixated on the parking lot.  The second is wise and articulate and relates to Larry a parable of the ""Goy's teeth"".  This story within a story was far the most engaging part of the movie.  The story is a conundrum without a solution and offers Larry no direction at all.  Finally, Larry demands audience with the most senior rabbi, the exalted ""Marshak"".  Larry glimpses Marshak, idle within his study like a distant, non-intervening god, but the rabbi refuses to speak with him, claiming to be ""busy"".  Strangely, this was the wisest advice any rabbi could have given to Larry!

  The point of the three rabbis seems to be the utter bankruptcy of traditional Judaism in solving the problems of the real world.  Indeed, in the opening scene, set in a traditional Polish shtetl, the ancestral home of America's Jews, a Jewish wife stabs a rabbi, thinking him to be an evil spirit, underscoring the film's negative opinion of the traditional religion of Judaism.  When Larry's son approaches the great Marshak during his Bar Mitsvah, the boy observes biological specimens and displays, evocative of Darwinism, and the rationalism of evolutionary science.  Has the greatest religious thinker of all discovered agnosticism as well?  Marshak quotes to the boy the key lines of the movie's theme song, Jefferson Airplane's Want Somebody to Love:  ""When the truth is revealed to be lies, and all the joy within you dies; don't you want somebody to love?"", the ""truth"" in question being the revealed truth of traditional religion.

  My main purpose in writing this review is to express my opinion of the cryptic final scene, which is generating debate.  At the Hebrew school, a tornado approaches.  While the incompetent rabbi fiddles with the lock to the shelter helpless to solve a real world problem, the children stare into the distance at the approaching cyclone.  The children figuratively stare into the maelstrom of a future of spiritual uncertainty; without the strong, unquestioned beliefs of traditional Judaism to guide them, whither will they bend their steps?

  The movie offers an interesting window into Jewish society, but as I mentioned earlier fails to create an enjoyable story somehow.  The writers appear to have been too preoccupied with creating a hyper-symbolic hyper-artistic riddle of a movie, rather than a living piece of cinematic art.  The film might be more like a Talmud on a biblical story, rather than simply the story in its wild beauty.  Moreover, the Coens present a savagely stereotyped portrayal of a non-Jewish, middle American family in the form of the Gopnik's neighbors, a hunter and his small son.  The ""goy's teeth"" was good, though.",1275350400,4,4130,5.047337278106509

3915434,2,B002E2M5IC,"Usually I dislike lazy comedies, over-hyped albatrosses like Avatar, and vehicles for the most over-rated actress of our generation, Renee Zellweger.  But occasionally, I dislike the critics' beloved sacred cows that may appeal to the intellect, but are, in the viewing, so unenjoyable an experience as to be nearly unwatchable.  And I think this perfectly describes A Serious Man.  I did like films like Adaptation and I Heart Huckabees, which nearly fall into this category but are enjoyable to watch, and thus leave one interested and engaged with the difficult themes.  After slogging through A Serious Man, I just turned it off and said, ""Well, that was obnoxious.""  The film presents themes (accepting life vs. fighting it; absurdity, the lack of easy answers; and, bizarrely, the undead -- the Jewish dybbuk) but seems to have nothing to say about them (the dybbuk is introduced in the 10-minute non-sequitur first scene which takes place in Medieval Poland, but is not referred to again).

I'm not sure what the appeal of the characters is.  Almost every character, major and minor, is portrayed as annoying, neurotic, ugly, whiny, frail, obnoxious.  The film goes out of its way to portray its Jewish cast this way, gratuitously.  In one scene, for example, the protagonist is getting advice from his sister (I think), who only appears sitting on a park bench in this single scene and is shown, inexplicably, to have braces on her legs -- because God forbid she just be a normal person!  You might disagree that the film is anti-Semitic, but I think that the only reason you could make that argument is because the Coen Bros themselves are Jewish.  If it's not anti-Semitic, then it seems designed to make the viewer come away feeling sickeningly like an anti-Semite.

A lot of people are going to heap praise on this movie, but it's just another arthouse-type film that only sounds good on paper.  I give it two stars because it's obviously well-made, because the Coen Bros are artists even when they suck, and because utter distaste for a movie is a better reaction to have than not caring at all.

Good Jew Is A Dead Jew

Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen are  great directors--their creative tandem is one of the most interesting phenomena in the contemporary American cinema. It is sufficient to recall their  acclaimed masterworks: ""Barton Fink"", ""Man, Who Was Not Here,"" ""The Big Lebowski."" Therefore it is extremely interesting to see their takes on the ""Jewish question"" in their two latest movies. They made a screen version of The Yiddish Policemen's Union (after the Pulitzer Prize author Michael Chabon's novel which had become a bestseller). The film action takes place on Alaska where the Jewish autonomy is being formed after the defeat of Israel in its war for independence.
The new film ""A Serious Man"" (In Israel it was renamed ""A Good Jew"") is  about American Jews--mathematicians, rabbis, lawyers, dentists and eccentrics, men and women, children and adults. This is a movie full of grotesque -each character makes us laugh until our stomachs ache. Laughter simply did not leave the audience. But the end was unexpectedly grim. (There is a lot of funny things in life, but little merrymaking.)The ending was harsh, and the leaving crowd was completely bewildered and discontent. This motion picture does not make sense,  what did  the directors mean after all? Someone told a joke about a woman confiding to a friend,  Yesterday Haim rushed in and raped me...What did he want to say by this act? Incidentally, during the viewing the real life conflict took place among movie-goers. (It added some new shades to what was happening on the screen.)  Behind an older couple a younger couple was sitting, they were over forty --I did not notice much younger people in the theater-- and they huddled close to each other, and they giggled and chewed their smelly popcorn, smacking and  crunching. The mustachioed man in the front, with a shaved head--apparently of the ""Russian"" origin-- turned around in anger many times, until the one who chomped stinky popcorn, asked, What? What don't you like here? The ""Russian"" got upset and said in Hebrew: ""Ma-ma, ata mafra, which means What-what, you a nuisance!). ""What, said the local guy, in Russia you cannot have popcorn?"" The ""Russian"" got seemingly excited trying to say that he hated smells in general, but it was something like: you like this hellish smell, but I do not like it. After this the local guy rose up, but the ""Russian"", even though he was twenty years older, had an imposing frame, and stood higher than a small and nimble local guy who had a cleanly shaven skull too ( widespread fashion). The tsk-tsk ensued from all sides, and the incident fizzled out-- the local guy moved to the other end, no problem, since the theater was half empty.
So what did directors (they are also the screen writers) intend to say? I myself got puzzled at first.
The plot goes like that. Professor of mathematics, forty-five and a good man-- brought up in the atmosphere of resisting evil-- lives in a cottage with his own exemplary wife full of energy and his two teenage children. One boy is turning 13 and he is preparing for his bar-mitzvah. The main character's brother also resides in the house; he is a lonely man, kind of eccentric and ill-adapted to real life. The house is full of shouting matches and conflicts-- between children, between the professor's daughter and her uncle, who occupies the bathroom for hours; between husband and wife (the film begins with her informing her spouse-- his absent-mindedness befits a professor of mathematics-- that she's leaving him for his best friend whose wife just died. Conflicts in the life of the professor arise on the whole ""perimeter"": it seems to  him that the anti-Semitic neighbor wants to grab part of professor's land and his Korean student is blackmailing him, slipping to him an envelope with money and demanding a higher grade;  his son, instead of studying Hebrew, listens to pop music and smokes marijuana; the brother does not want to move out doodling his  notebooks with Kabbalistic signs, gets  hysterical, and--in the end--turns out to be  a secret gambler and a pedophile. Professor's wife evicts his brother and places him at a motel, temporarily, until the professor grants her the divorce according to all the religious rules. There is also a neighbor -- femme fatale-- who is tanning on her lawn naked and tries to lure the tormented Jew into her trap. The ""good Jew's"" head is spinning from the conflicts, and from those who are trying to help him: lawyers, rabbis, and ""friends."" His dreams are nightmares: a femme fatale rapes him, dentists poke in his teeth, the anti-Semitic neighbor together with his son armed with a sniper rifle are on a hunt for him and his brother. After the numerous setbacks and suffering our inspired and triumphant professor became an apotheosis writing on a huge board, filled with scribbled mathematical signs, ""the formula of uncertainty.""

Yet somehow everything falls into line--his friend who tries to steal the goodly wife dies in a car accident; a stoned boy manages to pass a bar mitzvah ceremony and becomes a ""responsible Jew. At his workplace, our hero, yielding to blackmail, coughs up a higher grade for the persistent Korean and receives a desired tenure. And here the tale has to end ... But then comes ""rude"" ending: the hero receives a  phone call from his doctor about the lethal illness; and his son with classmates leaving a Jewish school, and enjoying the strong wind, sees a darkening sky and the approaching tornado ...
The Homeric laughter is being replaced with a dark prophecy. This unhappy end configures the entire film differently. Suddenly you realize that among all this whirlwind of Jewish characters there is not a single person, causing sympathy. On the contrary, they cause extreme irritation. No, not because they are all ""bad"", evil, treacherous, cruel, but because they are rather stupid, naive and hypocritical, while taking care of their strictly material interests and their kindness smacks of the lack of will. Their existence is kind of mechanical, meaningless, as if by inertia only. Their marionette looks, their
frazzle are ridiculous, and so familiar ... And the ""elders"" of the tribe, teachers and rabbis seem to be out of their minds. But the main and the most frightening thing is-- they are all, without exception-- empty! Of course the film is made with humor, but it is an evil, black humor, very similar to mockery. It contrasts sharply with the Jewish humor of Woody Allen. More than that, it seems to me that there is some ""controversy"" with Woody Allen, some polemics with him. Woody Allen's humor and his approach to people, Jews and Gentiles, are kinder and more tolerant to people treating them as mischievous kids, and Woody's final note is always festive; life is a holiday, a stupid one, but a happy holiday. The brothers Coen's humor is cruel, ruthless, evil-- in all their films and in this one-- in particular. If this film were not made by the Jews, it could be called an anti-Semitic one. So, perhaps, it's a film on self-hatred? Aren't many individuals among Jews nowadays who hate and despise their tribe?  Not the case, since the Coen brothers are betrayed by their harshness (theirs is a bitter humor), hoarseness and nearly despair that they embarrassingly hide in the cobwebs of the ""Jewish humor"". They are too serious! Bitterness and hopelessness lead to anger and apocalyptic prophetic rage. They seemed to say: this world is not worthy of life. They predict its annihilation. For them any ""good"" Jew is a dead Jew.",1272758400,3,7829,4.93455098934551
3915442,5,B002E2M5IC,"Supposedly writers never write about anything but themselves and artists never paint anything but exterior projections of themselves.  The Coen Brothers could use this film as a dissertation proving that statement.  They say this is not about their father yet their father was a Professor at the University of Minnesota and that is where Larry Gopnik, the main character, is a professor.

Larry Gopnik is a man who tries to do everything right, fitting in with the Jewish culture that has always been part and parcel of his life.  However, no matter how correct Larry is, in this movie the Gods turn their backs on him.  It is one disaster after another.  Hands down, the absolute best disaster is the episode involving his wife wanting a divorce and the guy she wants to remarry tries to ""befriend"" Larry. This guy, widower Sy Ableman, is absolutely hilarious and never more so than when we see how his plans turn out for him. The movie is one set piece after another of the trials and tribulations of Larry Gopnik in 1967 Minneapolis where he is working and raising his family.

What this reminded me of most strongly was early Woody Allen movies.  Larry is that beset and the situations are that hilarious.  In fact, I didn't realize how much I missed those movies until I saw the Coens' do their version.

I notice some here on Amazon rated this movie very low.  The only thing I can imagine is that they went into this thinking that it was going to be a typical Coen Brothers movie.  The odd thing is that it is a typical Coen Brothers movie IF you can manage to put aside the fact that it is entirely set within the Jewish American subculture, in Minneapolis 1967 no less.  I was raised Catholic, not Jewish, but frankly I find their predicaments pretty universal nonetheless.  I felt right at home with all the ethnic, religious and cultural craziness even though that is not my particular brand.  When you get right down to it, familial crazy is crazy, no matter which way you otherwise brand it.

3915443,5,B002E2M5IC,"A Serious Man. Joel and Ethan Coen are remarkably relaxed in their film making. They are cosy with each other,co-directing their films,creating ambience on their sets. They followed No Country For Old Men, a commercial,critical success,with this return to their Minnesotan mid-western roots. They want to show us the 60s,Jimmy Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane,but through a brown filter, that of  a Jewish family that are undergoing tribulations,loosely based on the Old Testament Book of Job. Their prologue of the dybbuk in the shetl laid down the tone, the idea of the curse. The film depicted a traditional Jewish family in a deadpan, laidback, dry- bone way.

The central character,physics professor Larry Gopnik(Stuhlbarg),is passive,decent, put-upon man,husband, father, brother,teaching physics(Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,Schrodinger's cat),filling boards with equations,but can't understand his life. He is being bribed by a Korean student to upgrade him in maths, who understands the stories not the math.,he's also suing him. His wife,the dominant partner wants a divorce to marry his best friend, Sy. He is coming up for tenure and poison letters are being sent to the University committee about him. His brother ,socially inept and involved with the Kaballah and gambling,lives with him. His kids are nightmarish,a mystery. His neighbours are wacky,one a redneck, the other a potsmoker  sunbathes nude. His solicitor's bills are expensive. He struggles to make sense of it all.

Larry seeks answers from the rabbis in his community to understand the mess his life has become. He approaches 3 rabbis with various results, you can only ask questions you can't gain answers or seek explanations. It's how you react to it, see different perspectives. What comes across is the squirm-inducing situations Gopnik finds himself in,and the gentle,wry way the Coens are able to wring humour out of Jewishness without in any way laughing at it or sending it up. They insert a lot of Jewish words in the screenplay,which are explained in the extras. There are shocking nightmare scenes and a funny post-pot smoking Bar Mitzvah scene. With the ending you have to see the bribe being alive and dead like Schrodinger's cat and God speaking out of the whirlwind. A Yoda-Rabbi quoting Grace Slick,that's a first! Brilliant cinematography(Deakins),fantastic acting by Michael Stuhlbarg.",1272153600,,2384,5.470108695652174
3915444,3,B002E2M5IC,"""A Serious Man""  is an original.  Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (""No Country for Old Men""), the film focuses on an Everyman named Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a Midwestern university where he will soon learn if he will receive tenure.  The year is 1967, and Larry is in for some unexpected troubles.  His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him for best friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed).  His unemployed brother (Richard Kind) is becoming more and more of a burden.  His son, Danny (Aaron Wolff), is secretly listening to rock music at Hebrew school rather than learning the Torah.  The alluring woman next door sunbathes nude.  Larry elicits sympathy because he is a decent guy bombarded by a series of incidents that lead him to wonder why God has singled him out for ""tsouris.""  Distraught, he consults three different rabbis, who lead him on a convoluted journey as he struggles to make sense of it all.

There are many Coen trademarks here:  emphasis on the grotesque, dry humor, ominous low-angle cinematography, situations bordering on the surreal, and bizarre dream/nightmare sequences.  The Coens tell their story episodically, offering perhaps a few too many tangential subplots.  When we think we've latched onto the main thread, focus shifts, and then shifts again.  The film is like a homemade chicken soup where the individual ingredients haven't quite blended.

Performances are uniformly low-key as characters create comedy in subtle ways.  There are no jokes, but we laugh at the earnest characters, the absurd situations, and the skewering of established religion.  ""A Serious Man"" is the anti-sitcom.  It showcases a family with its warts and flaws right out front.  Ozzie and Harriet never worried about the meaning of life or why a dark cloud settled over the family.  The Coens revel in dissecting Larry's angst as we watch his awkward, humorous missteps through life, relationships, and morality.  The ending is rather abrupt, and might require a replay to understand how everything comes together.

Blu-ray and DVD extras include the featurettes ""Becoming Serious,"" which explores the creative vision behind ""A Serious Man;"" ""Creating 1967,"" a tour of the Minneapolis neighborhoods used in the movie; and ""Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys,"" a guide through the mysteries of the Hebrew and Yiddish languages.",1271894400,3,2351,5.164021164021164

3915446,4,B002E2M5IC,"No surprise that this has so many generally querulous reviews here, as it's made for a pretty narrow audience. I found all sorts of reasons to not like it, in fact, but the sheer brilliance of the brothers Coen as filmmakers and writers is impossible to dismiss even here.

Suffice to say, you've got a much better chance of appreciating this if you enjoy watching people suffer, a constant barrage of all things Jewish and suburban, or enjoy others' lack of enjoyment. This film is mainly focused on those three things, and while its constant and overloaded sense of irony is its saving grace, it's also just plain aggravating after a while. I don't much enjoy an excess of any of the above three categories, and if this had been made by anyone other than the Coens it would be two stars.

But of course no one else could have made this, and certainly nowhere near as tightly. The acting is uniformly excellent, the set design and photography near-perfect, and the stoned bar mitzvah is certainly a unique scene (autobiographical?). It's also a mercifully short film--thanks for that!--and does contain a decent number of very funny moments. The kid who can't speak without using the f-bomb (we all knew one of them), Larry's laughably fake and duplicitous wife and ""best friend"", the selfishness disguised as religious piety and caring cultural awareness, and the spot-on recreations of suburban 1967, just before the hippie vibe hit America full on, are all well worth frequent chuckles. Yet there's also so much unhappiness suffusing almost every scene that unless you're in the mood for this sort of extremely dyspeptic humor, A Serious Man has a good chance of sending you into A Serious Bummer.

But I'm pretty sure the Coens made this mainly to humor themselves, and as a touchstone for them to revel in as their days shrink in number. And who can deny them that pleasure? They've given us so many classics already, so let them have their fun. Just know that their fun is clearly not everyone else's, and in fact that seems to be the point here. I imagine that if one grew up in their world that this would be a masterpiece. One thing for sure: I'm deeply glad I didn't grow up in their world!

And I guess that I'm glad they did, for that perspective has created some of the best celluloid art of the past two decades plus. That many fans don't love this one hardly puts a dent in the Coen oeuvre. One thing for sure: their next one will likely do an about face as usual, and in this case that's A Serious Relief.",1271808000,,2522,4.597777777777778

More like a Dramedy, a study in characters where the humor is very subtle.",1271635200,,319,4.283333333333333

They end up with a curse struck down upon them.
Then we are in present day Minnesota with a physics teacher and family man who is a descendant of the old couple(or maybe just another jew in another time). His life starts falling apart with one unfortunate event after another as he lets everyone in his life walk all over him. The movie continues with the usual Coen dark comedy. The ending is abrupt and stupid. I'm all for satire, but all the stereotypes get to be a bit much.  The Coens could have done a better job with this one.",1271376000,7,808,4.3509933774834435
3915449,4,B002E2M5IC,"SOMEBODY TO LOVE, the Jefferson Airplane's (J.A.) soaring 60's anthem expressing the transcendence
of existential anxiety ""When the truth is found to be lies, you
know the joy within you dies.  Don't you want somebody to love..."" opens,
closes, and plays a central part in this dark comedic look at Jewish life in the 60's.  Having experienced J.A. five times live in the
60's, I was more than hopeful when I heard its uplifting, aerodynmaic rhythms
again for the first time in years.  Once, at the Filmore in San Francisco, J.A.'s Grace Slick
projected her laser like eyes to me during ""SOMEBODY.."" for what seemed like an eternity (more like 30 seconds). For me, the best thing about
this movie is that it led me to recapture my love of J.A. (this time on Youtube).

The first time I watched A Serious Man, I and my parents were quite
disappointed.  We agreed it was disjointed (lots of dream sequences) and lacked character development.  I not
only fell asleep, I hardly laughed.  But in honor of the J.A., I gave it another
viewing the next day when I was more in a movie mood.  The 1st scene that pulled me in
this time around was the tedium of Hebrew School being disrupted by the Rabbi pulling the plug on the transistor radio
the 12 year old boy was listening to and the class erupting with laughter as SOMEBODY TO LOVE completely upset
the routine quiet.  What teenage boy of that era would not have preferred
this song to the repetition of learning a difficult language?

The aforementioned boy's father is a math professor so out of touch with
his marriage that he is shocked when she tells him she wants out and is
having an emotional ""affair"" with a ""friend"" of theirs.  ""When the truth is found to be lies..."":
his ""solutions"": move to a specific motel (as requested by his wife and her love interest) where he comes off so passive, you wonder
how she married him in the first place.  For example, his rival places
his hand on him in a superior manner across the table, and he does not pull away.
He later gets stoned on marijuana and seriously flirts with/dreams of a neighbor's wife and then
seeks the counsel of 3 rabbis--the most wise of whom is ""too busy thinking"" to see him!
This elder ""sage"" has reached a stage in his life that he only greets the young men shortly
after their Bar Mitvah ceremony.  And when he meets the aforementioned 12 year old after
his Bar Mitvah, he not only returns the confiscated transitor radio, but
paraphrases SOMEBODY TO LOVE in a question ""When the truth is found to be lies, and all the hope within you dies....then what?""
The Bar Mitvah boy does not know how to answer but is clearly touched that
the Rabbi took the time and trouble  not only to learn what song disrupted Hebrew class, but
but named 4 of the J.A.'s members--a hip and caring sage indeed.  So I disagree with
those who found this portrays Jews in a negative manner.  I would say more in a sometimes
painfully honest and amusing light.

The ending will leave you hanging.  Do not watch this movie

you are, it may remind you of some wisdom you have heard before such as taking a 2nd look at things if your world falls apart....",1271116800,,3217,4.477739726027397

First, I am a devout Coen Brothers fan and have loved all of their work; however, this is the first movie I have viewed by them that was a disappointment.  I understand about the curse and I found it funny that the writer/director focused the movie on the curse very little.

The characters were believable and it had my attention from start to end, however, there was just something it desperately lacked.  In many ways it didn't feel like a Coen Brothers movie and due to the many other great endeavors the brothers have achieved, this specific title just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Perhaps it was the pace of the movie, maybe I was expecting another O Brother Where Art Thou or The Hudsucker Proxy, or maybe every genius is entitled to flop at one time or another, regardless I was entertained but left feeling senseless.

3915453,1,B002E2M5IC,"I'm utterly baffled by the glowing reviews of this film, from seemingly intelligent people.  Can we have been watching the same film?  The film I saw was the cinematic equivalent of a root canal.  15 minutes in I was feeling unengaged, after half an hour I was wondering in frustration: ""where is this GOING?"", and after 45 minutes (feeling rather cheated by all the positive reviews) I decided I'd rather write a review of it than finish watching it.  I see from the many other extremely negative reviews that my opinion wouldn't have changed.

Allow me to summarize the plot:  after a ten minute episode about a dybbuk set in a Jewish village in Poland (which was rather creepy and interesting but had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film), the remaining 90 minutes of the film are taken up with Larry, who lives in a banal Jewish suburb in Minneapolis (?) in the 60s, and  is beset by troubles from the people around him.  In response, Larry does..... nothing, and learns nothing.  There's a Sopranos-style ending, and that's it.

Upon further reflection, I've decided that you'd need to be Jewish (or at least, of a religious/mystical mindset), in order to have the deep thoughts that people are apparently having about symbolism, the meaning of life, Judaism, God, etc when they watch this film.  If that's the sort of thing that turns your crank then apparently you'll like this.

For me this was the wrong movie. As an atheist, these themes are completely uninteresting to me, and there's not much else going on here.  The movie is not 1/100th as funny as Lebowski, it's painfully, PAINfully slow, full of very ugly (in all senses of the word) and uninteresting people.  This film is reminiscent of Days of Darkness by Denys Arcand (shlumpy everyman is beset by troubles, not much happens), but in that film, the everyman at least displays human reactions, fights back, learns something about himself, and finds a bit of peace.  In short, it has a ""story"", and thus it's a far, far, FAR more watchable film than this mess.

Acting, sets, cinematography are all very good (the actors all convincingly portray repellent and unwatchable people).  With all this talent, it's too bad they didn't make a movie.  I read the New Yorker review of this film which I thought was very good: ""As a piece of moviemaking craft, A Serious Man is fascinating; in every other way, it's intolerable.""",1270425600,11,2391,4.734299516908212

It gives a humorous but serious view, not only of life in the USA in the 50-60's, but also an informative point of view of Jewish-American culture. Most Importantly is its insight into the human drama that we all are a part of; anyone from any background can understand the difficulties and the joys that Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) anguished over. It is as Henry David Thoreau would say, "" We lived our lives of quiet desperation.""  Poor Larry, he could not understand from his rational point of view that sometimes life is what it is. As Clive's father (Stephen Park) advised him, ""Accept the mystery."" In the end the advise from Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell) to the son, Danny (Aaron Wolff) best fits it all, ""Be a good boy.""

3915455,5,B002E2M5IC,"A Serious Man is an exquisite work of art by Joel and Ethan Coen. Although one could say that the pace of the movie is slow, I think it allowed for some extraordinarily fine character development and the acting was completely outstanding from these actors some of whom are largely unknown. The choreography and the cinematography shine and the script was brilliantly written; there's scarcely a minute flaw in this remarkable movie.

When the action begins, we are treated to an elaborate opening which takes place in an eastern European village over a hundred tears ago; although brief this sequence manages to explore life, death, luck and relationships in a very concise way without ever providing concrete answers to the issues discussed by the characters. This sequence also lays the groundwork for the main portion of the movie. We then meet mathematics Professor Lawrence 'Larry' Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who experiences life as a series of events that either take him by complete surprise or grab him by the throat and never let him take control. Lawrence is a passive man out of touch with himself and his family; but yet his inability to find meaning for major life events is something we all can relate to at least now and then in our lives. Larry is stunned to hear from his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) that she wants a divorce as well as a Jewish ritual to end the marriage; Judith has found romance with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed) and she wants Larry and his mooching brother Arthur (Richard Kind) out of the house very quickly. At the same time, poor Larry tries to cope with the sudden and understandably upsetting deaths of a lawyer and someone else (I can't say who without giving something away so I won't name names here).

Worse yet for poor Larry, he's oblivious to the fact that his son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is experimenting with drugs and ordering record albums all the while charging it to Larry; and it's not any better when the FBI come to Larry's home to inform his brother Arthur that he better not be caught gambling again! In addition, Larry is pestered by a young Korean student (David Kang) who has failed the mid-term exam; the student and eventually even his father try to bride and intimidate Larry into giving him a passing grade. Even Larry's next door neighbor Mr. Brandt (Peter Breitmayer) causes trouble for Larry.

Larry tries to find answers and meaning for what happens in his life; his lawyers almost always tell him that he's in a real mess. Larry also goes to Rabbis for help but finds no clear-cut answers because the Rabbis lack concrete and profound answers themselves. Look for great cameos by George Wyner as Rabbi Nachtner and Simon Helberg as Rabbi Scott. Alan Mandell does a good job of playing Rabbi Marshak, too.

The DVD comes with a couple of nice extras as well.

A Serious Man paints an unforgettable portrait of a man, a type of everyman, who tries desperately to understand why bad things happen to him in his life; Michael Stuhlbarg gives a stunning performance that you really should see. While it may seem as if I've given it all away, I assure you that I haven't and the emotional effect this film will have on you will not be lessened one bit by what I've written here. Don't pass on this excellent film; it will provide you with so many meaningful issues to think and talk about with your friends and loved ones. I highly recommend this motion picture.",1270339200,4,3420,4.683860232945092
3915456,2,B002E2M5IC,"Weird or pointless movies can be original and even good as the Coen Brothers have shown in ""Fargo"" and other films. However, if that is the only kind of film you make, no matter how artfully done, it becomes boring and is no longer new. This film has some value to non-Jews who are curious about some of the faith's terms, practices, beliefs, etc. However, a documentary would have been a much better way to learn. The characters use all kinds of Hebrew terms in the movie and it must have been perplexing for non-Jews in the theaters. On the DVD they give you a dictionary so you can translate. The brothers try to make the film somewhat interesting by putting this Jewish family in the 1960's Midwest (mainly because that is where and when they grew up) and have things go wrong in the father's life but to me it was a pointless, tedious mess. Lots of great production design and CGI work done in the service of a story with no reason for being. They tack on a silly made-up fable before the main titles that runs for around 10 minutes and has NOTHING to do with the movie. The Brothers even admit they just wanted to make a short fable so they used this movie to film one. It adds nothing to the film's story but I guess if someone else is footing the bill, why not? They even say it is like a cartoon before a movie. It is non even a real Jewish fable, it is totally from their imagination and plays more like a Stephen King short. Thanks for wasting my time, Coens. The reason I give this movie two stars is because the actors do a great job with very little to work with. It is sad to see talent wasted on a truly wretched script. Starting with a pointless fable and ending with head-scratching tornado, this movie seems to have been made on LSD. Black comedy? Nope.

The acidic plot (whose narrative pulse would seem at first glance borrowed from Woddy Allen's approach)is merciless, devastating but never falls into a mournful or indulgent vision. As a matter of fact, the epilogue of the movie invites us to think that no human being may boast about his good fortune and that the elusive line between success and failure is thinner than we usually tend to think.

3915461,5,B002E2M5IC,"This movie serves well as an Obituary for American Judaism. The ""golem"" metaphor at the beginning of the movie is a reflection of Judaism itself. I say this as a Jew who has lived in Israel.
The main character's  pathetic nature is reinforced by all the worst in modern-day Judaism. This pathetic reflection of a man out-of-touch with himself, wife and kids, remains a harsh reflection of much of Western Culture, stripping bare of what in reality it means to 'yield-to-be-good' in a post-diaspora world.

It is a rare movie that I finish and think to watch again very soon. There is so much power in the exploration of this weak, browbeaten man. I enjoyed the fact that he could appear to be more-than adequate at work, but a total wimp with wife, and stand helplessly cuckolded, even allowing the adulterer to dictate terms to him, and have him move to a motel as the wife's lover prepares to take over the man's wife, home and family.
The bribe business is merely the last piece of himself that he surrenders. He's already surrendered manhood and fatherhood, now he surrenders his integrity, honesty and professionalism even as he gets what he's seeking. The complexity of the summation is only made more beautiful as he gets the medical ""bad news,"" and the tornado is artistic perfection.

It really is a bare-knuckle indictment of modern man as well as Judaism, within its stripping bare of the nonsense and almost paganistic ritualism of chanting irrelevent Hebrew, the glowing parents and his lawyers/co-workers' glowing-reviews of the stoned 13 year-old all combined to make a point brilliantly.

I think in this post diasporic END TIMES, a film like this is a jewel. The dream sequences with the canoe and his brother were phenomenal. The sexy neighbor sequences were great, as you wonder if she will make a man out of him, sort of she's gonna 'save' him type thing with sex and marijuana, and when he suddenly wakes up in that motel room, you feel like it's YOU who have been dropped out of that exciting dream yourself.

Just a great piece of work; brilliantly ending with the approach of apocalypse, which is what this kind of man, replicated by the tens of millions amongst us today, will bring to humanity to hasten its doom.",1269561600,19,2239,4.745501285347044

3915463,5,B002E2M5IC,"I couldn't love this movie more.  It is one of my favorite Cohen Brothers films.  A SERIOUS MAN is patient, hilarious, sharp and honest, it questions the meaning of existence but seems to offer an answer as well, in a similar way that THE BIG LABOWSKI does.  Like the Dude the protagonist, Larry Gopnick is encouraged by others to seek answers and take himself seriously which only makes Larry more frustrated.  Larry tells the Rabbi's receptionist ""I am a..serious man"" when he is exactly the opposite.  This mirrors the Dude when he gets irate (very ""un-dude"") and quotes George Bush Sr by saying, ""this act of aggression will not stand...""  Maybe the Cohen brothers are suggesting that it should be enough to trust one's morals and seek life's meaning there and not get corrupted by an absurd society full of grudges, expectations and superstitions.  As they say in Labowski ""the dude abides.""  and in a Serious Man, the Rabbi says ""be a good boy.""

In this film, the Cohen brothers have fun showing the absurdity of everything from math, law to religious ritual.  There is a sort of meaninglessness behind it all, in so far that the meaning fails to connect with the characters involved.  But there is also a tenderness and affection that Ethan and Joel have for their characters as well - more so than in BURN AFTER READING or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.

For the detractors...
I pity those who think this film is stupid or a waste of time - you're missing out.

He also finds himself on the verge of tenure, as well as hounded by the Columbia Record Club because of his son's passion of Jefferson Airplane and Santana.  Ever so slowly Larry's world begins to unravel and he feels powerless to do anything about it, and so he turns to his rabbi for answers.

The film explores the causes of angst with all the wit and irony viewers have come to expect from the Coen Brothers, however ""A Serious Man"" takes on deeper ethical and moral and does one dare say religious tones, as Larry finds his whole life called into question, and unsatisfied by the anecdotes and allegories of his rabbi.  Underscoring Larry's trials and tribulations is his own son's personal journey into the psychedelic world of Jefferson Airplane, wonderfully played out in the lyrics of ""Don't you want somebody to love?"" as he prepares for his bar mitzvah.",1269302400,5,1202,4.759615384615385
3915465,5,B002E2M5IC,"Joel and Ethan Coen have time and time again managed to take us on the strangest and most fascinating journeys. With indelible characters that are alive, and possess the quirkiest of qualities, and worlds that are as odd and captivating, the brothers always manage to create something that has never been seen before, but is, at the same time, oh so familiar to us all. I don't think that anyone sees the world quite the same way that they do, and with A Serious Man, their collective vision has conjured up what may be the most personal film of their career. It is also one of the best.

The movie begins with a prologue of sorts, entirely spoken in Yiddish. A wife quarrels with her husband after he invites a dybbuk (Fyvush Finkel), a spirit from beyond the grave, into their house. This opening segment doesn't so much set up the main story as set the tone for the rest of the film. It is richly drawn out for suspense, and darkly comic, in traditional Coen brothers fashion. I at first thought the prologue may be an actual Yiddish folk tale, but I did some research, and as it turns out, it is entirely original. It is also delightfully off-putting in the finest possible way.

After this prologue, the main story begins in 1967. It revolves around Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor who is questioning his own purpose and existence as his life seems to be slipping out of grasp, to put it lightly. His wife, Judith (Sari Lennick), wants a divorce so that she can remarry their neighbor, Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a widower whose wife's body is ""barely cold"", and who is also Larry's ""best friend."" This is just the tip of the iceberg. Larry also deals with a disgruntled student whose bribe for a passing grade turns into blackmail, a woman sunbathing nude next door, and his brother Arthur (Richard Kind), who is staying on the couch, but is almost always in the bathroom, endlessly draining his cyst.

Larry attempts to understand why so many terrible things are happening to him, and throughout the course of the film, receives no concrete answers. He sees two rabbis, and fails to see a third. His visit with the second unveils an utterly enigmatic story of a dentist who finds the words ""Help me"" in Yiddish on the tooth mould of an oblivious gentile customer.

Michael Stuhlbarg is terrific in this film, and he plays Larry as a very likeable guy. It's as if at every catastrophe, he is watching the storm in shock and awe, wondering how this could be happening to him. As things escalate, and become increasingly worse, instead of giving Larry a breaking point, Stuhlbarg levels off at his peak of disbelief and tries to allow the character to come to terms with the situation, and to deal with it. This, of course, is ultimately an impossible task seeing as how God, or Hashem, is as ruthless to Larry as he was to Job.

Fred Melamed made me cringe in every one of his scenes. Sy's pompousness and calm are so potent, and his interactions with Larry are not for the impatient. They are downright frustrating, and it is a joy to watch Larry burn under the surface of his disbelief. The Coens are masters of these kinds of awkward interactions, and their writing and direction in this is flawless, as is the cinematography by Coen brothers regular, Roger Deakins. It is the movie that Joel and Ethan Coen needed to make, and to follow the deeply flawed, but hysterical, Burn After Reading with such an existential masterpiece is what the world of cinema needed.

*On a side note, Carter Burwell's score is genius as usual, but Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love"" is the true anthem for this film. It has never sounded so perfect and crisp, nor has it ever fit into a film so exquisitely.",1269216000,,3724,4.609351432880844
3915466,5,B002E2M5IC,"The Coen brothers - it always either works big time or is just ok. This movie worked big time for me. ""A Serious Man"" was written and directed by Ethan and Joel Coen. The Coen brothers other movies that really have stuck with me are ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", and this one. I love the way the Coen brothers always completely immerse themselves in a culture with each of these movies. They don't go halfway, you get every bit of it. Does every bit of it make sense? There's always a scene or two that will leave you puzzled and make you wonder why it was even necessary but I guess that's part of their creative process in establishing their setting. The intro to this movie had nothing to do with the rest, but I was still fascinated by it.

It stars Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry Gopnik, a Jewish man facing a lot of escalating problems that stack up as the movie goes on. His brother played by Richard Kind is a nuisance who mooches off him, sleeps on the couch, and gets into trouble with the law. His wife played by Sari Lennick wants a divorce and has already picked out someone to remarry played by Fred Melamed. His son is getting ready for his barmitzvah but also owes a pot dealer money. Problem after problem and it seems like no one really listens or has good advice for him. Michael Stuhlbarg really sells us the persona of a good man, trying sooo hard to do the right thing, be a good person and doesn't consider for a moment getting really upset with his wife or kicking his brother out. He is so earnest and so desperate (and so funny) in this dark comedy.

This wouldn't work without the other supporting cast members delving deeply into the Jewish culture for us to get a sense of this society in the 1960s. Absolutely fabulous performances by Sari Lennick and Fred Melamed in particular. Also Richard Kind is still the king of playing that guy, that mooch of a guy that's always there and you have a hard time saying no to.

I loved the set up, the music, the drama, the darkness, the off-the-wall stories and comic moments, the suspense, and the surprise dream sequences (one of which got me GOOD, I jumped!). The ending will have you scratching your head and wishing for more. I highly recommend this movie if you are into dark comedy, Jewish movies, and/or Coen brother movies.",1269129600,,2325,4.4402810304449645
3915467,2,B002E2M5IC,"Until the last few minutes of this movie, its hero Larry Gopnik is both (a) a perfectly good man, and (b) a spineless worm who lets the world walk over him.  Neither trait is humanly credible.  Consequently, the movie is too divorced from reality to have much meaning, even as a comedy.  And since spinelessness is hardly admirable, one cannot say that Larry is an attractive or sympathetic figure.

The movie is also plagued by elements that remain--how to put it?--unassimilated.  Take its curious prologue, which is a parable about moral ambiguity.  Someone who appears to be a revered elder and a good samaritan may actually be a demon in disguise--or maybe not; it's hard to tell.  But the film itself is about a latter-day Job who suffers the insults, afflictions and outrages of the world:  an unambiguously good man to whom unambiguously bad things happen.  In short, the prologue has nothing to do with the movie.  It's merely the Coen brothers indulging themselves to no purpose, and not for the first time.

The same is true of Rabbi Marshak quoting Grace Slick.  Yes, it's a send-up of a false sage.  But it's also shallow Boomer populism, telling us, with a collusive wink, that we can get as much wisdom from trippy rock songs as from the learning of the ages.

3915469,4,B002E2M5IC,"I can't recall such disparate reviews for a film - which is, I suppose, not surprising, given the subject matter and the often-polarizing Coen brothers.  For every film they've made that has received nearly universal acclaim (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), they've made one that either inflames or frustrates or just leaves many scratching their heads (Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Big Lebowski - yes, remember this film was panned when it first came out, before it attained its now-legendary cult status).  I wouldn't call this my favorite Coen brothers film by any stretch, but I found it a remarkably well-told, fascinating story, filled with the usual vivid assortment of Coen characters.  For me, whatever flaws it may have are infinitely offset by the wonderfully skewed view of people that the Coens present - no one else makes films like this, and A Serious Man is most certainly cut from the same odd ream of cloth the rest of the Coen milieu comes from.  Just to see Sy tell Larry that he believes it's important at times to count to ten - and then to have Sy literally do that very thing, out loud and then sliently - is, to me, what makes a Coen brothers film so funny and so compelling.  I'd say the same for the scene where the Korean student's dad confronts Larry in his driveway; it's funny because it's uncomfortable and awkward and a trifle disconcerting.  In any case, I would never suggest that this is a film for everyone - the reviews here certainly bear that out.  But I don't understand why some would say it's anti-Semitic, or that you have to be Jewish to relate to it, or that it doesn't tell us anything new about its subject matter.  I think many are simultaneously reading too much and not enough into the film.  And I suspect the Coens are perfectly fine with that, since I doubt seriously they expected this film to be embraced universally.  And I think that's why they make such great films - they make what they want to make, and let the proverbial chips fall where they may.  Thank goodness for that.",1268784000,7,2073,4.590785907859079

3915477,4,B002E2M5IC,"You fervent movie buffs all know by now that the Coen Brothers grew up Jewish in Minnesota. They 'know' Minnesota to the bone; they proved that in ""Fargo"", still my favorite among their films for its deep understanding of the Minnesota conviction that decency will prevail over depravity, even if only by naive luck. But I was born in Minnesota and spent part of my childhood there, so I have an insider's response to that depiction. The Coen Brothers' films about the Deep South and Southern California are satires from the point of view of a disrespectful outsider. Those films are uproariously funny and probably objectionable to the victims of their satire. The Coen Brothers also 'know' the lifestyles of American Jews to the bone, and I can testify to their authenticity, being married to a nice Jewish girl from Beverly hills, with a large Jewish kindred that has begun, after thirty years, to forget to notice that I'm not Jewish.

The 'Minnesota' touches in ""A Serious Man"" were subtly satirical, though the humor may have been too ""in-group"" for anyone who lives within a few hours drive of an ocean. I laughed out loud at every appearance of Larry Gopnik's 'goyishe' neighbor.

The portrayal of the Gopnik family and its insular Jewish community? Was it satirical or was it as 'serious' as Larry Gopnik tried to be? Ay, there's the rub! In many ways, it was devastatingly serious, a bluntly realistic depiction. My wife and I could identify each character in the film with someone in her family. And my wife's relatives, especially the older generation, hated this film, were offended by it, considered it a betrayal. In the film, all of humanity is either Jewish or goyish, and the goyim scarcely matter. Well, it's fair to say that many Jews of my acquaintance do think that way. After the most recent LA earthquake, for instance, I saw a headline in The Jewish Times: ""Massive Earthquake in Northridge: Four Jewish Homes Damaged."" But don't all ethnic and/or religious groups think that way? Do African-Americans or Chinese-Americans ever NOT notice who is and who isn't? Of course, that insularity is one of the themes of ""A Serious Man"" and the Coen Brothers don't refrain from mocking it fiercely. But one gets the feeling, in this film, that the subject is too immanent, too raw, for their usual absurdist humor. A quasi-insider like me will laugh, but uncomfortably.

The other, even more serious theme of ""A Serious Man"" is the question of God's Providence for Man. Mathematics Professor Larry Gopnik, whose academic niche seems to be the 'proving of uncertainty', is going through a rough patch of life, a melange of minor annoyances and major catastrophes. The script implies that Gopnik has been a perfunctory Jew, one of the majority (I think) who identify with the culture and cling to the community but who are not 'serious' about their belief in God. (Or should I use another holy name? Y-hw-h. Ein Sof. Adonai.) His troubles - his tsuris - compel Larry Gopnik to seek advice and consolation from his Jewish world, specifically from his various Rabbis, none of whom has anything but platitudes and evasions to offer. Things do not get better for Larry in this film. This is no resolution, no intervention, unless one can be content to suppose that Larry is really under a curse, that Adonai has a grudge against him. For hapless farshlugener Larry, life has become just one d+mn thing after another.

Is the film funny? Yes, I found it funny, but short of hilarious. The Brothers may have found themselves being too serious in trying to treat both sides of their identity - Minnesotans and Jews - in one script.

Then is the film serious? Frankly, I have a hard time taking that question of God's Providence seriously. I haven't had the least doubt of the answer since I was nine or ten years old. But I'm sure that people who do take the question seriously will regard The Coen Brothers' treatment of it as superficial and unoriginal.",1268006400,3,3962,4.79502196193265

3915482,4,B002E2M5IC,"Writers and directors, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, have often made their mark in cinema (Blood Simple, Fargo) with their take on the human condition shot on an independent film budget.  In A Serious Man they get self reflective on their own childhoods growing up in a Jewish family of the 1960's.  The result is their most personal, incisive film to date, and one that is told with sharp observation and honesty.

An opening scene tells the tale of a peasant couple visited by an elderly man who turns out to be a ghost.  Are they cursed or blessed by this ominous apparition?

In a 1960's Minnesota suburb, Larry Gopnik is a timid college professor with a wife, son, and daughter.  His son is smoking pot, and his daughter steals his money for a nose job.  One day his wife announces that she and his best friend Sy have become close and that she wants a divorce.  Further, Sy wants to have a long talk with Larry to counsel and help him through his tough time.  This happens at the same time Larry is up for tenure at his college, and a Korean student tries to bribe him for a passing grade.  As if this weren't enough, his brother, Arthur, who has all sorts of physical ailments and personal problems, is staying at his house.  Meanwhile, Larry spies on and is tortured by his female neighbor who likes to sunbathe in the nude.

Things go from bad to frustratingly worse as Larry goes to see three rabbis for advice only to get inconclusive or non-answers.  His bills with the attorneys are mounting, and he is told to move out of his own house.  Now the Korean student's dad threatens to sue him, and he is plagued by nightmares.  The events don't turn out as expected and the twists and turns culminate with his son completing his bar mitzvah.  An ominous new set of events threatens to uproot his world even as Larry seeks to make sense and order of his plight and tries to do the right things and be a `serious man'.

The storyline will ring true for most audiences, especially baby boomers.  Larry is a brilliant study in angst and suffering.  By the film's ending, the question remains: what is important in one's life?  What matters most?  No commentary is made or judgment passed about Larry and his family, and the Coens offer no answers.  What we get is a case study of one family trying to survive fractious events.  Although told from their Jewish background and experiences, the Coens are able to strike the right emotional connection by showing Larry's response to a difficult set of circumstances.  His feelings and reactions are universal, and perhaps that is the point of the movie: The problems of the common man are eternal and life is a stream of situations that can be daunting and are constantly supplanted by new adversity.  Much as Ordinary People revealed discord and a disconnect in a middle class family, A Serious Man shows this family slowly disintegrating.  Larry's situation bears striking similarities to the lead in Into the Night.

A mostly unknown cast actually helps the film by not having the distraction of well known faces.  They are people like you and me.  Michael Stuhlbarg is quite convincing as Larry, and folks might recognize Arthur portrayed by TV character actor Richard Kind.

It's not the Coens' best work but it is their most intimate one which they could afford to do after winning Best Picture with No Country for Old Men only a couple years before.  It's certainly one of the most original screenplays of the year.",1267747200,4,3473,4.616639477977161

3915485,2,B002E2M5IC,"Isaac Bashevis Singer once said that a writer's job is simply to tell a story.  By that he meant that writers should avoid the pitfalls of ""making a point."" In keeping with the Singeresque opening of A Serious Man, the Coen brothers should have followed the advice given by a man who really knew his dybbuks.

A Serious Man lost its way almost immediately after that all-too-short Yiddish folk tale opening. (If they had only stayed in Poland, what a film it would have been!) As soon as the action moved into the 20th century the Coens' contract with the viewers was broken. Not only did they fail to tell a story, they failed to develop characters, or to provide a basis for caring about what happened to them. In fact, by the end of the film, I was longing for them all to die.

As in all Coen brothers' films, the photography was atmospheric, crisp, innovative. There was an occasional good scene (the ancient rabbi quoting Gracie Slick was superb), but the thin infrastructure (i.e. lack of a plot), didn't support the better qualities of the film. The ending, to put it mildly, was a let-down. (You can't wrap up a story if there isn't one.) A Serious Man was not so much a black comedy as a blah one.",1267574400,12,1207,4.452488687782806

At least I was, but maybe no more because Burn After Reading also smelled - really bad.",1267488000,3,371,4.23943661971831
3915487,5,B002E2M5IC,"There is a brief opening scene I did not understand - Sort of a Yiddish tale.  It shows a peasant coming home in a snowstorm after his cart broke down.  He tells his wife he was helped by Reb Groshkover (Fyvush Finkel) and he invited him in for soup.  The wife is upset and says that Reb is dead, and has been for over three years.  He must have met a dybbuk (a ghost - or undead being).  The guest is adament he is not a dybbuk and the wife stabs him to prove it.  The guest totters out to the cold blizzard.

Set in 1967, this is a satisfying movie showing how Larry Gopnik, (Michael Stuhlbarg), a Jewish man, searches for moral clarity in an ambiguous life.  He feels lost and aghast that his life was all a lie when his wife (Sari Lennick) asks for divorce,  he is tempted by a seductive neighbor, his unemployed brother's excapades, his children's rebellions (smoking pot, stealing money from his billfold), and getting tenure as a professor at a small college in Minnesota.  The scene opens with his discussion with a Asian student.  The student is getting an ""F"" and he wants a passing grade.  First he asks to take the test over.  Professor Gopnik  holds firm the grade will not be changed.  The student leaves an envelope full of cash (as a bribe).

The film shows Larry searching for the reason he is living and making sense of what is happening.  His wife blindsides him when she asks for a divorce to marry the widower, Sy Abelman, a close friend to both.  Larry is asked to move out of his home to the ""Jolly Roger"" with his jobless brother-in-law.  Larry questions his life and meets with three different Rabbi's who give somewhat bland and non-fulfilling answers on what life is about and how to deal with it.

While his wife and Sy Ableman make plans for the future, his brother becomes more annoying and dependent, a nasty letter writer tries to hurt Larry's chances for promotion, Larry seeks advice from three different rabbis. He wants to do the right thing and move on.  Larry wants to be a serious man.

It is a entertaining dark comedy, that gives some clarity to moral choice at the end.",1267401600,,2111,4.428571428571429
3915488,5,B002E2M5IC,"This is the Coens' masterpiece. Obtuse, perplexing, exceedingly clever and insightful. From the perfect synchrony between the physics concepts Gopnik teaches and the form and content of the film, to the great characters and perfect acting, A Serious Man doesn't miss a beat. It follows a physics professor whose life is falling to pieces. Ironically, his decline mirrors the very concepts he teaches to his students, but he can't quite grasp the application to the real world. He focuses on the math, but doesn't understand that the principles apply to life as well. As such, he refuses to SEE the reality of his situation, the causal factors that are leading to his crises, and that his lack of objectivity in this regard is the very thing that keeps things from getting better.

At the end of the film there is a scene where Gopnik makes a choice and the consequences are immediate, as if the phone call he receives was a collapse of quantum probabilities determined by his own state as the quantum ""observer"" and the choice he just made. He constantly refuses gnosis (""I don't want Santana *Abraxas*!""), sees only the chaos, and is thus at its mercy.

There are minor plot lines that don't come together in the end or lead to a climax.  This movies moves as slow as the main characters life.  Larry Gopnik's life is just a series of lower lows with nothing to make us care or have much interest in his life.

Was it some sort of childhood payback that led them to make this movie about growing up Jewish and dysfunctional? If there was a plot, it may (?) have had something to do with the meaning of life being buried in a Jefferson Airplane song, but it was impossible to tell. I tend to think that its whole purpose was little more than an indulgent piece of throwaway art. Though the acting was good, the talents of those involved were wasted on slow, boring dialogue that tries to generate sympathy for the tortured hero at the center of the film. Sadly, it never quite got there for me or those with whom I watched it.  It ended with us scratching our heads and wondering how it got made. As a final note, I found this film insulting to Jews and ""Goys"" alike (mostly goys) sterotyping both in the most negative manner. Not a single laugh, and not even close to the Coen brothers that I thought I knew.",1267142400,31,1034,4.302564102564102
3915491,5,B002E2M5IC,"upd 01/26/2018: I watched this movie again after 8 years and found it very enjoyable, somehow my impression is completely different now.

here's my original review written on Feb 26, 2010:

I'm not a huge fan of Coen Brothers' movies, but sometimes I just want to catch up on what's going on in American cinema nowadays. Being beyond the pale for Avatar, I go for ""Burn After Reading"" and ""A Serious Man"".

I can find some excuse for rehashing old Graham Greene novels in ""Burn After Reading"", this excuse being - absolutely no pretensions. Also - pretty good satire (both Linda Litzke & Chad Feldheimer are very funny and easily recognizable types). Finally - star performance of John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and yes - even Brad Pitt!. That being said I'd have given this movie 4 stars in its genre of (almost) mindless and second-hand comedy.

Now to ""A Serious Man"". This movie is clearly an indication that anything goes in American cinema today. Ron ""true faith"" in his comment here (also one star rating) with a title ""Nothing new under the sun"" says that ""A Serious Man"" is a ""film that gives arthouse cinema a bad name"". Come on, Ron, how can you even mention arthouse here when talking about this movie.

Coens start with a short flashback to 18th century Europe where they show a Jewish family encounter with a so-called ""undead"" dybbuk, ""a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person"". The viewer's supposed to make connections between this encounter and bad luck of a Jewish physics professor in the second half of XX century.

This bad luck being: a wife who wants a divorce (to get married to a professor's old friend), a 13-year-old son smoking pot, car accidents, students who pressure him to accept bribes in exchange for good grades, etc, etc - and finally some bad news about recent X-ray examination. The problem with all this is that it was said and filmed countless number of times, from Philip Roth to Joseph Heller including all this Jewish family athmosphere, for which one is advised to go no further than Curb Your Enthusiasm. After Larry David one needs to add something really significant to the subject if one desires not to be completely discounted.

No pop-philosophy including biblical references to the story of Job or whatever else would help, because the film is absolutely pointless and senseless. Another good example - gentile neighbours and Korean student with this bribe story. Why all that? What's the point? Why Korean? Can somebody explain please? The scene with the first (young) rabbi is the only one really worth watching, but is it enough for the full length movie?

When one's reading Portnoy's Complaint - everything's to the point, beacuse the book is really groundbreaking. To an extent this can be said about American Pastoral, or Something Happened. But after the string of movies like ""About Shmitd"", ""The Truman Show"", and other ""deep psychological/philosophical/existential"" flicks ""A Serious Man"" leaves one with a strong resolution not to touch anything produced by Coen Brothers ever again.",1267142400,10,3092,4.9326923076923075
3915492,5,B002E2M5IC,"Probably the, ""artiest"", thing the Cohen Bros have done since Barton Fink; A Serious Man is loosely a modern day adaptation of the book of JOB. Already notorious with a sense of humor that can be a little mean; the Cohen Bros. fill this movie with amazing scenes that are filled with a bitter anxiety but also a deffinite comedic dynamic. The film is asking you for a couple of viewings, to take in everything; and that's what makes this a great film to own.",1267142400,,458,4.4
3915493,5,B002E2M5IC,"This movie is no less than an examination of faith. The repeated message is ""embrace the mystery"" and the ending will leave most everyone confounded. It offers many questions, but no answers...indeed, many scenes embrace just this sort of quandary: too many questions in life, not enough answers. The movie is an examination of that mystery: what is life? What is purpose? It is told from the perspective of a Jewish family man, a Physics professor seeking tenure, in 1967 America. The themes, however, are universal. The movie is nothing less than the most important question a person can ever ask: Why am I here? Embrace the mystery.",1267056000,,635,4.888888888888889

This movie is the pits. I hate movies without story lines. This is just s whole lot of jumbled pieces stuck together.
My hats off to all the folks whom said this was a masterpiece. I wonder if they have ever seen a real movie?",1267056000,5,483,4.094736842105263
3915495,5,B002E2M5IC,"The Coen brothers just get better and better. Every little detail is important. Every faces. Every gestures. Every grimaces. A picture hanging over one's shoulders. A word within a dialogue. Every camera movement. Colors. Every-little-thing-is-worth-your-attention.

It might seem incoherent at first but it's not. The brothers may use false modesty but we know that nothing in their scripts and in their films is ever left to chance. Not even the little fable at the beginning of ""A Serious Man"".

And with time, it looks like they are ending their movies abruptly (""No Country..."" and this last one) but in reality, it's far from being the case. It's gonna become a new thing to like within their body of work. The way they end their stories.

I won't dissect ""A Serious Man"" here. Others have done it with biblical proportions. I don't think it's what the Brothers want. Their message, in my humble opinion, is relatively easy. It's written at the start of the movie. Something like ""Receive with simplicity what is given to you"".

The main characters don't accept their faith. They are letting corruption in their lives. And they get punished at the end. Oh! They are layers of metaphores, that's for sure. The jewish people, the wrath of God, the decline of the U.S.A...

But the Brothers are also saying to receive their movie with simplicity.

Have you all read the incredible amount of lines some people have written here? But i guess it stands as an hommage to the brilliance and depth of this movie. The Coens must seriously laugh if they read ""Amazon"".

With all being said, i do think that ""A Serious Man"" is easilly one of the three best movie of the Coens. Along with ""Fargo"" and ""No Country..."".

And can someone please tell me at last if there's a darn second meaning to ""She wants a gett""... ""A what?""... ""Oh! Ok. A gett.""

3915496,5,B002E2M5IC,"I read these reviews.  They are all excellent but where is the simplicity?  I am reminded of a quote attributed to Franz Kafka, ""The meaning of life is that it stops.""",1266796800,,167,4.354838709677419
3915497,5,B002E2M5IC,"While there are many other great reviews on here for this film already I will throw my hat into the mix with my two cents. Having been raised Jewish myself the film instantly let me relate in a very personal way. I no longer practice but all those prayers and songs stay with you forever. All I need to do is hear some of that stuff and I can almost start chanting in all on my own.

Right away the film reminded me of Albert Camus The Stranger. Coen brothers already tackled The Stranger head on with The Man Who Was Not There. Many of their other films deal with fate, free will, personal choice, destiny, and morality. Fargo, The Big Lebowski, No Country For Old  Men are a few that come to mind that deal with these topics. Are we in controll? How does morality factor in, and if we have control can we push or pull against fate or destiny?

In ASM Larry is much like Meursault from The Stranger. He is carried along by fate, others, and resists only a little here and there. In The Stranger Meursault never resists his fate and is killed at the end. Every time Larry pushes even a bit there are consequences. As others have eloquently pointed out, acceptance of fate is the core of the film and attempting to be incongruous to it will lead only to problems.  Even the problems encountered by Larry all along are nothing compared to what results when he goes against his own morals at the end.

The film is slow and plodding. It was a dense film that will surly produce more gems upon further watching. I do want to watch it again a few times to examine it, I will not be watching this film every second like TBL to just view again and again. I still consider it one of the best films of the year and enjoyed it greatly.",1266624000,,1724,4.2439024390243905
3915498,2,B002E2M5IC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'A Serious Man' begins with a short 'film-within-a-film"" illustrating an old Jewish folktale (spoken in Yiddish) about a Dybbuk--a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. A man comes home and informs his wife that he met an old man in the street who the wife insists died three years ago. Suddenly, there's a knock on the door and the old man is welcomed in by the husband. The wife, however, is convinced that the man is an evil spirit and plunges a knife into his chest. The old man gets up and states he realizes he's not welcome in the home and walks out the door. The folktale serves as an introduction to both the internal and external arc of the story. In both cases, 'tsuris' (a Yiddish word which means troubles) comes to the film's main character, Larry Gopnik, and members of the conservative Jewish community he's part of.

  Larry is a physics professor at a local college in the Midwest. He lives with his wife, son and daughter and an oddball uncle who at first seems a bit eccentric but later turns out to be completely dysfunctional. We soon realize that Larry is the embodiment of a modern-day 'Job', illustrating the old adage, 'sometimes bad things happen to good people'. The 'bad things' include one of Larry's Korean students who tries to bribe him with a large amount of cash, hoping that he'll change his grade. The student's father later threatens Larry with a lawsuit for defamation.

  Things begin falling apart completely for Larry when his wife announces that she's leaving him for the vapid Sy Ableman, an aging widower who hugs everybody who he comes in contact with. Since Larry is such a pushover, he agrees to Sy and his wife's demand that he move out of the family house and into a local motel. Things get worse when Uncle Arthur is arrested for gambling and later for sodomy. Larry ends up compromising his principles by pocketing the Korean student's bribe money and changing his grade in order to pay a rich lawyer to defend his dysfunctional uncle. Larry is also up for tenure at the college but one of his colleagues on the tenure committee tells him that someone has been sending letters to the committee, impugning his character. After Sy is killed in a car crash, Larry finds out (inadvertently through his wife) that it was Sy who bad-mouthed him to the committee.

  Things seem as though they're about to turn for the good for our modern day Job: Son Danny manages to do well at his Bar Mitzvah and Larry finds out that he's on track to get tenure. But at the last minute, Larry gets a call from his physician who wants him to come in immediately and discuss test results--although we don't see the scene with Larry meeting his doctor, the implication is that Larry is about to receive a cancer diagnosis.

  The Coen Brothers know how to tell a good story but they have created a group of caricatures, sort of a 'hate letter' to the conservative Jewish community they grew up in. The passive schlep Larry is the only sympathetic character in their entire narrative. Otherwise, every other character (and most of them are Jewish) are either nasty or ineffectual. It's one thing to ridicule a group of people, pointing out their shortcomings--but it must be done with affection and not contempt. Here, the Coen Brothers are always looking at their fellow Jews as if the glass was half empty and never half full.

  As Larry's life spirals out of control, his quest for guidance from members of his community falls on deaf ears. The Coens ridicule the community by showing how Larry receives useless advice from a succession of two Rabbis he visits. The first one is a Junior Rabbi who ultimately suggests that Larry passively accept whatever happens to him since we can never know what God has planned for us. The second, Nachtner, an older Rabbi, provides even more useless advice in the form of a parable about an orthodontist who discovers cryptic letters on a Goy's (non-Jew's) teeth. Larry is exasperated when there is no moral to the story and the Rabbi seems to enjoy reciting the tale simply for its own sake.

  Finally, there's a third Rabbi, Marshak, who appears extremely old and feeble. He declines to see Larry but later his son Danny has an obligatory meeting with him after his Bar Mitzvah. Rabbi Marshak had pocketed the transistor radio given to him by a Hebrew School teacher who earlier had confiscated it from Danny who was listening to the radio and not paying attention to anything said in class. The senile Marshak obviously had been listening to the radio earlier and recites a list of popular rock groups (including Jefferson Airplane) before handing the radio back to Danny.

  Whereas the member of the community are ineffectual, Larry's family members are a nasty bunch. In addition to his adulterous wife Judith, Larry's daughter Sarah filches money from him to pay for a nose job. Then there's Danny who's addicted to watching 'F Troop' on TV and who must always avoid the neighbor down the street, a youth he too has filched money from. The aforementioned Uncle Arthur won't get a job and ends up in handcuffs for molestation.

  As someone who was Bar Mitzvahed in 1966, a year before this story takes place, I well remember my own contempt for some of the rituals and convictions of my co-religionists. But as I grew older, I realized that everyone has their good points and bad. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers smugly stand above the fray and delude themselves into believing that they're enlightening their audience. In actuality, the Coens remain in an earlier arrested period of development and provide an inaccurate view of the conservative Jewish community they're commenting on.",1266537600,3,5753,4.738476953907815
3915499,1,B002E2M5IC,"I have bad news and good news. The bad news: this movie will frustrate you and leave you depressed and hopeless. The good news is that if you buy a used copy, it will probably only have been viewed once. For me, once was one time too many. The story line is awful, there are no likable characters, and no meaningful answers (which is exactly the point of the movie). Contrary to the reviews, there are no funny moments. The lead character is not ""serious"", he is a victim of mediocrity with no direction.

If a non-Jew produced this movie, he would be hung in effigy as slimy racist. The feeling you will have after the movie is that the typical American Jew is superstitious, stupid, cheap, and a perpetual victim of his/her own self-destructive insanity. (As opposed to my clearer picture of a typical Israeli Jew who takes responsibility for his/her own destiny to solve any problem to achieve greatness.)

3915501,2,B002E2M5IC,"A lot of words have been used to describe Joel and Ethan Coen's latest film:  dark, comedic, personal, philosphical, etc.  Here's another one:  pretentious; although I'm not sure that the Coen Brothers would be displeased with that description.  You have to respect the fact that they have made the movie that they wanted to with little regard to what critics or fans have to say.

The movie focuses on Larry Gopnik, a physics professor living in Minnesotta in 1967 who finds himself the unwilling recipient of a number of crises.  His wife is leaving him, his brother is mooching off of him, his children have discipline problems and don't respect him, one of his students is trying to bribe him in order to receive a passing grade and he has neighbors who barely mask their contempt for his Jewish heritage.  In an attempt to try and find guidance and answers for what is happening, Larry seeks out the counsel of three rabbis.  Not surprisingly, they offer nothing other than glib generalizations that are meant to make them appear wiser than they really are.

To me it seems that the main idea being tossed around here is the general randomness of life.  Why do bad things happen to decent people and do we have any control over what happens to us.  Larry's mantra seems to be ""I didn't do anything"", and indeed he is very passive throughout the entire film, looking to others for answers to his problems.  When he finally makes a decision in the films final act, even more bad luck seems to be dished out to him.  Why is Larry suffering?  Is it becasue of his lack of action?  Is he sealing his fate by accepting what happens to him?  Or does he have any control over his circumstances at all?  The movie offers no answers.

Sounds profound, right?  The problem is that while it may sound interesting on paper, it fails miserably as a movie.  Things move at an unbearably slow pace despite the brief running time, nothing happens and there isn't a single character that you care enough about to pull you into the story.  So what we're left with is a film that will be disected and poured over for deeper meaning.  Entertaining and engaging the audience seems to have no purpose....much like the storm of catastrophies engulfing Larry.",1266278400,2,2239,4.629441624365482
3915502,4,B002E2M5IC,"Joel and Ethan Coen explore some familiar themes in an unfamiliar environment in ""A Serious Man"". -Unfamiliar in the sense that the Coen brothers usually toy around with the idea of a disordered universe in noirish crime films. They gravitate toward film noir, because existential crime films of the 1940s posited a chaotic universe in which protagonists struggled to create order, or just to survive, in the midst of events that buffeted them about and mocked their complaints. But in ""A Serious Man"", no one is being chased or giving chase. There is no crime, no shootings, or thrills. There is Larry Gropnik, a Jewish family man living an ordinary life in a midwestern suburb, 1967.

Larry's (Michael Shahlbarg) world is coming apart. Everything he ""felt was one way turns out to be another"". He's pressured from all directions, but none of it makes sense to him. His wife Judith (Sari Lennick) wants a divorce so that she can marry Larry's coworker and family friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed). One of Larry's physics students tries to bribe him to pass the course. Someone is writing libelous letters to the tenure committee. His socially inept brother Arthur (Richard Kind) won't move out of the house. Arthur is working on a probability map of the universe to make sense of it all. And preparations are under way for son Danny's (Aaron Wolff) Bar Mitzvah.

Coen brothers fans will like or hate ""A Serious Man"" depending upon whether they like the idea of an existential crisis brought on by a fundamentally disordered universe being transferred into an ordinary environment. Larry isn't coping with criminal intrigue but with his inability to make sense of the everyday and his obsessive desire to do so. ""What's going on?"" is Larry's refrain as well as the film's. In a bit of daring, ""A Serious Man"" mocks the idea that religion has anything to offer people seeking life's meaning. It likes Larry but laughs at his angst. The re-creation of the post-War suburbs with a cultural revolution just around the corner makes this a sharp period film too.

The DVD (Universal 2010): There are 3 featurettes. ""Becoming Serious"" (17 min) interviews the Coens and the film's producers about making the film and the actors about their characters. ""Creating 1967"" (14 min) gives us a tour of some sets and visits the locations with production coordinator Jess Gonchor and special effects supervisor Larz Anderson. ""Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys"" (2 min) defines many of the Yiddish and Hebrew terms in the film's dialogue scene-by-scene. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French.

3915504,4,B002E2M5IC,"""A Serious Man"" is the closest that the Coen Brothers have come to writing something semi-autobiographical; they grew up in a largely Jewish suburban Minneapolis neighborhood (St. Louis Park) and they set their story in a Minnesotan Jewish suburban enclave, in the summer of 1967 (when Joel was 13 and Ethan was 10). God help them, however, if their family was anything like the Gopniks (although if they were, it would explain a lot about the world view they expound in their films). Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a ""serious man""- a buttoned-down physics professor who can map out the paradoxical quantum mysteries of Schrodinger's cat on a blackboard, but is absolutely stymied as to why his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) suddenly announces to him one day out of the blue that she wants a divorce. To add insult to injury, she wants him to move out of the house as soon as possible, so that the man she wishes to spend the rest of her life with, a smarmy neighborhood widower named Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed) can settle in.

This situation alone would give any self-respecting mensch such tsuris, nu? Yes, it gets worse. Larry gets no sympathy or support from his snotty, self-absorbed daughter (Jessica McManus) or his stoner son (Aaron Wolff), who spends more time obsessing on his favorite TV show ""F Troop"" than brushing up on his Hebrew for an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. He also has problems at work, ranging from the usual politics of academia to staving off a deranged student who is attempting to blackmail his way to a passing grade. And then there is his perennially underemployed brother (Richard Kind) who has become a permanent house guest who spends an inordinate amount of time in the bathroom, draining his, erm, cyst (ah, yes-we're still firmly entrenched in Coen territory here, kids).

Teetering on the verge of an existential meltdown, Larry seeks advice from three rabbis, embarking on a spiritual quest in order to glean, well, ""Why me?"" The story takes on the airs of a modern fable from this point onward, neatly telegraphed by the film's opening ten minutes-a blackly comic, old school Yiddish folk tale with semi-mystical overtones strongly reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"". In the context of the Coen's oeuvre, the character of Larry Gopnick is not really so far removed from William Macy's character in ""Fargo"" or Billy Bob Thornton's character in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (sans the murder and mayhem, but sharing the plight of the hapless Everyman, ultimately left twisting in the wind by the detached cruelty of Fate...and the Coens themselves).

This is one of those films that I think I need to see again, because it really has some interesting layers to it that I don't think can be fully appreciated in just one viewing (especially for its provocatively enigmatic ending) It's smart, it's funny, it's made (gasp!) for adults, and it's one of the most wildly original films I've seen in a while. The cast is excellent, especially Sthulbarg and Kind, who are very believable as brothers with a complex relationship, and have some genuinely poignant scenes together (does their relationship reflect Joel and Ethan's, I wonder?). I have to mention a wonderful (if brief) performance by Amy Landecker as the sexy neighbor, Mrs. Samsky (channeling Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson), who has a hilarious seduction scene with the uptight Larry.

When the film was in its initial run, there were some mutterings about the film being ""too"" Jewish, propagating stereotypes and so on and so forth, the Coens are self-loathing, blah blah blah, but I think that's silly. Hey-I've got relatives that are more ""Jewish"" than the characters in the film. Besides, the Coens are Jews-is there some law against artists incorporating their heritage into their art? One might as well condemn Phillip Roth, Saul Bellow, Jules Feiffer, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen and Neil Simon for the same ""crime"".",1266192000,3,3916,4.9558599695586

The only problem is that the movie even lacks a punch line, something that the series Seinfeld made sure to deliver.  I'm sure that the Coen brothers are laughing to themselves at all of the profoundly Earth-shattering ""truths"" that people are falling all over themselves to extract from this pointless movie.

3915507,4,B002E2M5IC,"""A Serious Man"" provides us with a view of 1960s middle class suburbia as only the Coen Brothers, in all their warped glory, could conceive of it.

Larry Gopnik is a mild-mannered college professor who lives with his wife and two teenaged children in a spare, homogeneous housing tract, where every home comes replete with its own perfectly manicured lawn and gnarled antennae.  Larry may be leading a life of soul-sucking banality, but it isn't until he discovers that his wife is planning to leave him for a mutual friend of theirs that he begins to question God's purpose for his life.  The Coens deftly satirize the age-old Jewish propensity to heap scorn and guilt upon oneself when things aren't going well in life, and to seek out divine explanations for all one's problems, even with the awareness that such a search will likely lead to more questions than answers in the final analysis.  Larry even has his own King David moment when he espies a neighborhood Bathsheba sunning herself in a nearby yard.  But he's a David who, for all intents and purposes, has no real kingdom to rule over - his wife and kids being, at best, indifferent to his needs and dismissive of his authority - and no special connection to a God who remains stubbornly silent to all Larry`s pleadings for help and understanding.  In fact, the Biblical character he comes most to resemble is Job, as the afflicted man begins to question why, after a lifetime of trying to do the righteous thing, God has suddenly seen fit to rain down all sorts of trials and tribulations onto his increasingly balding head.

It makes perfect sense for ""A Serious Man"" to be set in the 1960s, a time when traditionalism and modernity were duking it out for supremacy, even in the drab placidity of a sterile suburb, the last spot on earth one would expect to find such upheaval taking place.  Yet, unlike in urban centers or on college campuses where it was taking place out in the open and in full view of the public, the cultural revolution in suburbia was occurring largely within the nuclear family unit and behind closed doors.  Thus, in ""A Serious Man,"" we have youngsters who study Torah in between smoking pot, listening to Jefferson Airplane on cheap transistor radios, and watching ""F Troop"" reruns on TV, and adults who plan their child's bar mitzvah while partaking in the ""new freedoms"" of divorce, marijuana and extramarital hanky-panky.

With its relatively low-wattage drama, austere visuals and trademark inconclusive ending, ""A Serious Man"" is not a sure-fire crowd-pleaser on the order of a ""No Country for Old Men"" or ""Burn Before Reading"" (as much of a crowd-pleaser as any Coen Brothers movie can be, that is), but those with a taste for understated quirkiness should derive a great deal of pleasure from this movie.  Jewish viewers, in particular, may find much to identify with in the knowing satire put forth by the authors.

As Larry, Michael Stuhlbarg turns the ultimate nebbish into a perfectly recognizable everyman character.  He receives fine support from the likes of Richard Kind as his troublesome older brother, Sari Lennick as his unfulfilled wife, Aaron Wolff as his socially awkward son, and a whole host of other superb secondary players too numerous to mention.",1266105600,,3265,4.840215439856373

3915509,5,B002E2M5IC,"The Coen brothers have written and directed another great darkly humorous movie with ""A Serious Man"". It's a movie that will do more than make you laugh though - it'll make you think. Think about how all those daily problems can add up. Think about how bad things happen to good people. Think about how things can almost always be worse. Think about what life might really be about.

With Adam Arkin and Richard Kind being perhaps the most recognizable names, the largely unknown cast still shines. While the Coens can work with anyone they want, this shows that for them it's all about the movie-making and picking the right cast regardless of star-power. Michael Stuhlbarg in particular is excellent as Larry Gopnik, the main character who begins to ask himself what life is all about. Larry suddenly finds his life falling apart around him, from big things to the very small. His wife decides she wants a divorce; however, this doesn't seem to bother their two kids - their son just wants the antenna fixed so he can watch ""F-Troop"". Larry has to help his older brother - who's already living with the family and unable or unwilling to find an apartment - out of trouble with the police. A student in Larry's physics class tries to bribe him for a passing grade while the school board is considering him for tenure. It all gets to be too much for him, so he tries to consult three different rabbis, getting three very different responses.

While the movie has a strong Jewish element to it, you don't need to be Jewish to appreciate it (I'm not). If you're afraid you'll get lost in the handful of Yiddish expressions used, they even have an extra on the disc a few minutes long which provides definitions. People from any background can identify with the feeling of being overwhelmed though. Everyone at one time or another asks themselves if there's really any meaning behind life and all the suffering that goes on. Often the answers we're given by people we think will know more seem hollow and unhelpful. Many of the situations in the movie may seem outrageous, but that doesn't affect how relatable Larry's plight is. His character is very ordinary which makes him easy to sympathize with.

If you're a fan of dark comedy or philosophical comedy or of the Coen brothers (perhaps there's more than a little overlap there), I highly recommend this movie. In some ways it may be rather simple, yet it remains very original. I think it is among their best work.",1266105600,,2466,4.664367816091954
3915510,5,B002E2M5IC,"This is not a comedy except in the very darkest sense of that concept.  It's much more of an existential drama. By the Coens' own admission in one of the bonus features, it does not have a plot.  Neither does it have a resolution.  But that's what life is like for Larry Gopnik and for many of the rest of us as well, right?
Spoilers ...............................

Larry is beset on all sides by a sexy neighbor, a wife who is cheating on him, a daughter who takes his money to save for a nose job, a son who is getting high on pot in Hebrew school, a tenure committee that is accepting negative letters written about him, a student who tries to blackmail him regarding a grade, a Columbia Record house salesman who wants money for records Larry never requested, etc.  Larry tries to talk to others about all this, especially rabbis, but nobody has a real answer for why he is suffering.  In this sense, he reminds me of Job in the Bible.  There is no tidy wrap-up at the end, only the promise of a tornado and very possibly some bad medical news for Larry.

This is an existentialist film for sure.  It requires concentration and thought, and it's definitely not a sitcom or some silly comedy that goes for an easy joke.  It's no wonder that few theatres carried it and few people saw it on the big screen.  But I think it plays even better on the small screen, since it is not carried out on some epic style.

Coen fans will also appreciate the brothers' attention to detail, especially the 1967 Minnesota setting.  They talk about this in the bonus features, which are helpful to watch before seeing the film.  It also helps to check out the Hebrew translation feature so you know what people are saying, since not all of it is subtitled.",1266019200,,1743,4.423197492163009

3915512,5,B002E2M5IC,"t's been mentioned many times that A Serious Man (2009) is a retelling of the Book of Job. It very well could be - as only Coen Brothers could adapt the Biblical story to the screen. They placed Job, the Schlimazel of the Old Testament in Minnesota suburbia of their own adolescent. They named him Larry Gopnik, made him a physics professor in a local college, a nice, loving, and pious man, and let him watch hopelessly how his life was collapsing around him while he tried to make sense of what and why was happening to him and desperately sought after a spiritual help from his religious advisers, three rabbis - in vain. A Serious Man is not an autobiographical movie but it is set in the very atmosphere and spirit where two Coen boys grew up in the year 1967, the exact year Joel Coen turned 13 and was preparing for his own bar mitzvah - just like Danny Gopnik, 13 years old pot smoking Jefferson Airplane fan Larry's son whose Bar Mitzvah in the movie is a truly unforgettable event for many reasons. Now, as the experienced celebrated filmmakers who have proved (at least for this viewer) to be among THE best modern filmmakers, Coens look back at the place and time that shaped them as individuals, men, and creative personalities, and they ask eternal and often impossible to answer questions. Does life have meaning? What is the point of it? Or is there point at all? Why do bad things happen to a decent person who ""did not do anything""? Is there any certainty in life or all we can do just accept the fact there is no explanation, no certainty, and no fairness, and the best is - ""to receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.""

I can understand how this film may be puzzling and even disappointing for many viewers even among the fans. A Serious Man is different and original even for Coens, always innovative and creative artists, but it is undeniably and unmistakably, their film, with their finger prints all over. Take for example the opening scene, the black/white prologue spoken in Yiddish and set somewhere in Eastern Europe back in the 19th or 18th century, in a small Shtetl. It involves a married couple and their mysterious visitor who could be a dybbuck, an evil spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. The scene certainly would stay with a viewer and make them try to understand its meaning. As one explanation, the husband and wife could be the ancestors of Larry Gopnik before his family immigrated to the USA and ended up in Minnesota. The encounter with the dybbuk could bring the curse to the future generations, and that may explain all assortment of ""tsuris"" that poor Larry tries to deal with. Coen's explained that they wanted to include a folk tale to set the tone in the film that explores among many things Jewish traditions, religion, faith, and character. They could not find a tale they'd like, so they wrote one and made a very stylish, ominously dark yet funny and mysterious opening to their film. As a perfect balance to the fairytale/ghost story opening, the final scene comes that literally can blow you away. As it has happened before in a Coens 'movie , the open ending has as many admirers as haters but I believe it was no other way to finish the film, and I found the ending perfect in the universe that Coens create.

The brothers' decision to cast mostly unknown stage actors in the main roles, proved to be successful one, and everyone was up to their job. Michael Stuhlbarg positively shines as Larry and he makes one of the most sympathetic characters in Coens' movie. Sari Lennick, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed as a seriously creepy man whom Larry's wife Judith wanted to leave Larry for as well as the rest of the cast are all memorable. The camera work by Roger Deakins', the longtime collaborator of Coens in recreating the long gone era of the late 60s in the Middle of America is above any praise. A Serious Man is beautiful, profound, and perfectly well made. It is funny, too. Seriously.",1266019200,3,3987,4.598314606741573
3915513,4,B002E2M5IC,"As if they represent two halves of one soul, the Coen brothers definitely have a singular perspective on their films, and this richly idiosyncratic 2009 comedy feels like the most complete manifestation of their conjoined personas. An appreciation for Jewish culture would probably help in watching this film, but as someone who is only familiar with those traditions from late-night viewings of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Yentl"" on TV, I think the Coens manage to transcend the story's ethnic elements into an entertaining fable about fate and karma in suburban Minneapolis circa 1967, the same place and time when older brother Joel Coen would have been preparing for his bar mitzvah. That rite of passage is meticulously detailed with humor in this tale through bored adolescent Danny Gopnik, who would rather listen to the Jefferson Airplane through his transistor radio earplug.

The movie starts unexpectedly in a shtetl somewhere in Eastern Europe back a century or so, when a poor man and his stoic wife are visited on a wintry night by a scholarly rabbi she knows had already died. When the mysterious man appears at their door, she stabs him to prove she's right, that he is a dybbuk, an undead spirit inhabiting the man's body. Flash forward to 1967 and we meet Larry Gopnik, a put-upon Jewish professor of physics surrounded by marijuana-smoking son Danny, constantly agitated daughter Sarah, thoroughly resigned wife Judith, and slovenly brother Arthur who refuses to leave the house as he works on some unwieldy numerological treatise. As Larry awaits approval of his tenure at the university, his life starts to fall apart piece by piece. Judith announces her intention to divorce him to marry their smarmy neighbor Sy Ableman, and he is forced to move to a nearby motel when she empties out their joint bank accounts.

A Korean student named Clive insists the failing grade he received from Larry was unfair, and Larry then discovers an envelope with thousands of dollars inside. Pride overcomes temptation initially, but a series of unexpected events make the money more appear more desirable. To stave off his guilt and attempt to understand the root of his difficulties, Larry meets three distinctly different rabbis sequentially to sort out his troubles, but nothing seems to help. Once he makes up his mind about the money, fate seems to intervene again with even more dire consequences. There are no major stars in the cast, and stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg makes an auspicious starring debut effectively showing how Larry's soul slowly unravels despite his Newhart-like, button-down appearance. Perhaps intentionally with his glasses, he looks a lot like silent-screen comedian&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-Lloyd/dp/B000B5XORA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold Lloyd</a>.

The story's period detail is presented immaculately between Roger Deakins' cinematography, Jess Gonchor's production design, and Mary Zophres' costume design. The 2010 DVD offers a sparse set of extras.

A SERIOUS MAN has a fascinating overture  - a dark drama in Yiddish about a curse, a dybbuk ('In Jewish folklore, a disembodied human spirit that must wander restlessly, burdened by former sins, until it inhabits the body of a living person') and then plops us down in Minneapolis in a Jewish neighborhood inhabited by a strange group of folk - Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who copes with the inanities of teaching Physics while coping with a venomous Korean student unhappy with his failing grade, an inane tenure committee, a son readying himself for Bar MItzvah while running from his dope dealer, a redneck neighbor on one side and a vamp on the other side of his home that is being torn apart by a wife wanting a Jewish style divorce to marry Larry's best friend and a brother who is a live-in raunch, among other distractions.  Somehow winding through these 'curses' we get to know the real serious man and all the foibles that mark life among these weird characters.

I was curious as to why this movie never made it to our multiplex which usually shows every piece of film released. Now, I can see why the cinema owners didn't want to lose their shirts on this hideous misfire that might appeal to maybe one viewer--that would be the local newspaper movie critic who still thinks ""Citizen Kane"" is the greatest movie ever made.

For one thing, unless you're Jewish, nearly 98 per cent of this movie makes zero sense. The ""serious man""--played with infuriating vagueness by Michael Stuhlburg--is being divorced by his hideous slob of a wife who has the hots for another hideous man whose also Jewish. In other brainless scenes that no one can understand is the sub-plot of the brainless son who keeps running into his home from a bully. Oh, yes. There's the repeated plot line of him tellin his father that the TV aerial needs to be adjusted because favorite TV channels can't be seen.

There are endless shots of someone putting a record needle on a 33 1/3 record to listen to Jewish music or instructions and then there are endless dream sequences where you FINALLY see something interesting and colorful but these end up with the serious man waking up in a sweat. Haven't we all seen this same worn-out device in countless horror flicks made on $1.99 budgets-which, come to think of, looks exactly like this idiotic travesty.

We all know that ""the serious man"" is really a poor ole wimp because the Cohen Brothers dress him up in exactly the identical wardrobe of countless other wimps we see in horny teen adventures and modern tales of misfits--he wears his trousers too short with the cuffs almost halfway up his legs.

As to the usual crtics who gave this exercise in idiocy 4 star raves, I do wish that for punishment they would be forced to sit in a room where the Coen Brothers Production of ""A Serious Man"" unreels non-stop around the clock.

""The Shipping News"" for me will always be the worse movie ever made, but this one is close to being the worse of the decade.  Please spare me the ""you just didn't get it, it's so profound"" bull.  Whatever existential meaning this carries could have been conveyed on a postage stamp.  I'm just warning you that haven't seen it yet, you may feel enlighted and self important for choosing this one, but you'll hate yourself later.",1265760000,11,942,4.410404624277457
3915520,5,B002E2M5IC,"With A SERIOUS MAN, the Coen Brothers have crafted a movie that doesn't fully fit with the rest of their work.  Usually, their films can be divided in one of two categories: tragic dramas where most people end up dying; and so-dark-you-need-to-flip-on-the-lights comedy.  A SERIOUS MAN is neither.  It is dark; it is not a feel-good movie, and you walk away from it with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.  But it isn't wholly serious, either; it's comedy is wry and understated, even by Coen standards.  Nor is there really much of a plot: Larry Gopnik is a middle-aged college professor whose life is slowly spinning out of control.  His cyst-suffering brother Arthur is under investigation for various escalating crimes; his son, a stoner, is getting ready for his bar mitzvah; his position is up for tenure, just as a Korean student is trying to bribe him, and someone is writing nasty letters to the tenure committee; his wife is leaving him for a man who is rather less-than-ideal; and to add to his troubles, Larry is going through a rather strong crisis of faith, which even a string of rabbis can't help with.

This is a slow film, heavy on symbolism: it begins with a Yiddish folktale, and ends...well, symbolically.  In between, you will find some above-par performances primarily from a cast of unknowns, led by Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry.  The direction is as solid as ever; the cinematography (from Roger Deakin, frequent Coen collaborator) is beautiful; and the brothers' script well-deserves its Oscar nod.  There's not much here not to love; just remember, as Jessica McManus (who plays Larry's daughter) says in the making of feature: ""Every day that goes by they depress me more.""  This is not a movie for the weak-willed, and is sure to alienate some viewers.  But then, that's the Coen Brothers for you.  A SERIOUS MAN ranks among the best of their work, and will go down as a minor classic of understated film-making.",1265673600,4,1949,4.799401197604791

Maybe I'm just too nice a guy, but every character in this film was unlikable, from the wicked children, the unfaithful wife, the ""other"" man, the crooked student, and even the priest who was as disconnected from his flock as they come.  I get this film was chock-full of Biblical symbolism, but what it boils down to is that I just didn't care because it was just unpleasant.

3915522,5,B002E2M5IC,"[This is an attempt to interpret the complex narrative of the movie. Please read this *after* you've watched the movie - else skip to the last line :)]

Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics who teaches his students about 'Schrodinger's Cat' - the idea that the fate of an entity remains undefined right until the moment an agent acts and 'collapses the wave function,' so to speak. Gopnik believes that the story of the cat serves no purpose other than to illustrate a mathematical truth - and yet, strangely enough, Gopnik's human fate is no less uncertain and contingent than that of Schrodinger's hypothetical cat. For example, the very moment Gopnik ""acts"" to accept a bribe and pass his Korean student, his telephone rings, and he receives ominous news from his doctor. By this time, the strange causalities in the movie will have compelled us to ask if Gopnik's phone would have rung had he chosen differently. As Gopnik comes to realize, the ""truth"" of mathematics and numbers - be it in the form of Physics, the Mentaculus, or the Kabbalah - is beside the point. What is of essence is the human story.

To be sure, ASM is not an amoral thought experiment about actions determining outcomes. The movie takes a very specific moral position: ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" If you willfully ""act"" in defiance of your fate, you will reap the consequences of your actions.

Gopnik is a man who almost never acts. As Michael Wood points out in his LRB review, Gopnik lives in a world where ""agency always belongs to someone else."" Agency belongs to Sy, to the wife, to the son, and even to the Columbia Record club that makes you pay for taking no action at all. On the few occasions that Gopnik chooses to act, he meets with disaster. His refusal to accept his neighbor's encroachments into his property culminates in the bizarre death of a lawyer. His ""road rage"" - brought on by the sight of the Korean student - causes him to lose control of his vehicle and, via some twisted Schrodingerian logic, ""cause"" the death of Sy Ableman. Finally, Gopnik's refusal to accept the burden of his own legal expenses brings down a grave illness upon him. The moral of this tale seems to be: there is less suffering in passively accepting one's fate than in actively meddling with it - a credo of inaction, similar to the Christian doctrine of quietism and  the more ascetic interpretations of Karma.

And yet there is a delicious ambiguity concerning the theological foundation of this ethical vision. When Rabbi Marshak speaks to Danny, we wonder if we are hearing the settled wisdom of an ancient tradition, or the contemporary wisdom of a serious man who has just ""received with simplicity"" the truthless truth of The Airplane. Marshak's chamber, interestingly, looks more like the study of an amateur biologist, than that of a religious cleric.

ASM embodies the Judaic vision of tradition as a repository of stories. It has a ""Russian Doll"" structure - a story within a story, where the outer story echoes the inner one. What the dentist Sussman's story is to Gopnik, Gopnik's story is to us. Just like Gopnik, Sussman too is a ""serious man"" coping with a crisis that has turned his life upside down. Such stories - which constitute the tradition -  acquire significance through signs and tokens whose obscurity invites interpretation. The teeth in Sussman's story are referenced in Gopnik's story - we see a large model of teeth in Rabbi Marshak's chamber. And very mischievously, the background score chosen for the Sussman narrative is by Jimi Hendrix - a man famous for expressing himself with his teeth! ""What does it mean?"" Sussman asks the Rabbi, awaiting a revelation. The Rabbi is honest enough to admit his cluelessness - and so the mystery remains - only to be transmitted to Gopnik, and then to us - the last hearers of the story. Just like Gopnik, we too are addressees of the message that drove Sussman crazy. We too restlessly await an epiphany that will abolish the mystery.

At one level, this is a story about a father, a son, and the transmission of tradition. Note the parallel between Danny's Bar Mitzvah and Gopnik's tenure - the rites of passage father and son have to undergo. Our anxious wait ends with a ""mazel tov"" for both of them. The ""rite of passage"" theme is similarly evoked by the intense and purposeful neighbor who, determined to make a man out of his pre-adolescent son, inducts him into the violent sport of hunting.

The narrative has a beautiful circularity. When the story begins, the father is talking to his doctor and the son is in the classroom pondering a debt he owes. When it ends, the father is still talking to the doctor and the son is still in the classroom, except that now the clouds are gathering, and some great judgment is hand. The father makes his choice and condemns himself; the son dithers as the tornado approaches.

Thanks to Coen Brothers' attention to detail, one chances upon new significances in every subsequent viewing. The Rabbi Nachtner sequence stands on its own as a stunning reminder of the Coen Brothers' mastery of their medium. The actors deliver stellar performances - Stuhlbarg creates magic with his face and his voice. The crouched, defensive man who negotiates with the Columbia Record club could not be more different from the tenured professor who is about to change Clive's grade. And as we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, characters tend to have comical tics. There's Gopnik's wife's rapid blinking when she is agitated; Sy's tendency to say ""most important"" in his mellifluous voice; and of course, the kid in the bus who has just discovered the joy of expletives.

To call this movie a masterpiece would be to state the obvious. This is the Coen brothers' subtlest and most cerebral work yet. It is a serious work of art.",1264723200,287,5848,4.757396449704142
3915523,5,B002E2M5IC,"The Coen Brothers have had an unbelievably productive and impressive career thus far: not all of their movies have been superb, to be sure, but they've made an incredible mark on American film-making and have produced multiple films that will no doubt be heralded as classics. And although it did not receive the attention or box-office sales as some of their other works, ""A Serious Man"" is among the Coen's best. It is the best film I saw in 2009, and as far as I'm concerned should be heralded as a new American classic.

""A Serious Man"" is an existential drama (with trademark Coen elements of dark humor) whose plot is difficult to describe. Its ties to the Book of Job cannot be ignored, but to say it is simply a retelling of that story is somewhat reductive. It is also a story about religion, certainly, but even that doesn't capture this film's scope. It isn't about Judaism, or Christianity, or any God in particular -- it is about why the things that happen in our life happen, and to what extent we can even know or understand or influence these events. ""A Serious Man"" is about life and its contradictions. Its characters are in an endless state of flux, oscillating between certainty and uncertainty, faith and skepticism, knowledge and ignorance, and even life and death. It is about chaos, fate, inevitability. The protagonist, Larry Gopnik (an incredible Oscar-worthy performance by Michael Stuhlbarg) is a fantastic character study of a tragic hero, and everyman who wants nothing more than to understand others and to be understood himself. He longs to understand his place in the world, in the universe, in God's plan, and is eternally frustrated by his shortsightedness and inability to do so. Why are all of these bad things happening to Larry? Are they consequences of his actions, a punishment from God, or simply bad luck? Does anything we do in this life matter? And what does it mean to be a ""serious"" man, anyway? Larry seeks out the moral guidance of rabbis throughout the film, who seem to be as lost and clueless as he is. Though the rabbis we meet throughout the film are increasingly older and allegedly ""wiser"" (whatever that means), they offer fewer and fewer answers.

As is generally the case with the Coens, the film looks beautiful. The cinematography and direction are impeccable, and the plows slowly but meaningfully forward to its brilliant, pitch-perfect climax. The subtle but excellent score by Carter Burwell aids greatly, capturing feelings of longing, confusion, and inevitability which drive the film to its tragic end. All of the acting performances, mostly by essentially unknown players, are superb. I have to give special commendation to Fred Melamed's Sy Ableman, who has to truly be one of the funniest, most whacked character the Coens have imagined (which, given their repertoire of zany personalities, is quite a statement). And the use of Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love,"" which lyrically and thematically ties in perfectly to the film's themes and ideas is nothing short of inspired.

""A Serious Man"" is a film like no other, and is right up there with the Coens' best. In many ways it is their deepest, most mature film, loaded with existential crises and philosophical conundrums. It is a beautiful film to watch, a powerful, moving one to endure, and will leave you thinking about it for a long time to come. An absolute masterpiece.",1263081600,11,3405,4.887543252595155
3915524,5,B002E2M5IC,"Yes, it's not for everyone. A strong grasp of both Jewish tradition and quantum physics would do the potential viewer well in getting the absolute most out of the film. But, as someone who is by no means an expert in either area, this one hit me on quite a base level in its unflinching and very true-to-life depiction of a man's life coming apart at the seams and all the existential angst that ensues. The wonderful thing is, A Serious Man is not only deeply resonant and moving, but quite hilarious as well- in that dark, dark way that may be just a little too dark for some.

The Coens have always caught some flack for their supposed misanthropic elitism; or, in other words, what has been seen by some critics as a sort of contemptuous mocking of the characters they depict onscreen, the two directors never fully granting their filmic creations emotional sympathy. If it was previously easy to debunk this claim, it is now, with A Serious Man, a piece of cake. Has there been a performance in recent years more gut-wrenchingly honest and genuinely pathos-exuding than Michael Stuhlbarg here as protagonist Larry Gopnik? That the narrative thrust of the film is essentially centered around all the horrifying and humiliating events that befall Gopnik does not necessarily mean that the Coens thumb their noses down at this character. If we take into consideration the personal nature of the film (set in a time and place very much like when/where they grew up, and populated by characters probably not unlike those they knew), then it comes as no surprise that A Serious Man is the most studied and 'serious' Coen brothers film to date.

Simply in terms of sheer film-making craft, this is the Coens, and certainly cinematographer Roger Deakins, at the peak of their respective crafts. The recreation of a late 60's heavily Jewish Midwestern locale is pitch-perfect (minus a few very small anachronisms). Not a scene feels wasted, not a shot superfluous; the picture is beautifully symmetric in structure and full of little rhymes and rhythms and repetitions, plenty striking and quasi-iconic images (Stuhlbarg on the roof as pictured on the DVD and promotional poster being one of many), and lots of likely soon-to-be classic dialogue infused with both the Coens' trademark deadpan humor (a la The Big Lebowski) as well as the film's broader thematic concerns.

Then there's the ending, or perhaps as some would say, lack thereof. Not unlike the ambiguous note that No Country For Old Men went out on, the final moments of A Serious Man will probably leave many angered, many confused, and many disappointed. But I don't think there was any other way to close such a film, one largely concerned, as it is, with all the great uncertainties that plague life-- what more appropriate way to end it than with the greatest cinematic uncertainty of all? The final shot is, I think, one of the most haunting in cinema history. I've seen the film three times in the theater, each time leaving awestruck and emotionally drained as the various events of the film, its haunting score and its devastating philosophical implications swirl around my head.

A Serious Man, then, is truly a serious film, with the (black) humor only arising naturally from the utter tragic unfair-ness of life as seen through the protagonist's eyes, and not forced on the situations irreverently as in a lot of films. Given the uncompromisingly bleak nature of the film, perhaps it's best summed up by an old and rather clich&eacute; platitude (not unlike the one the film somewhat ironically opens with): When you feel like crying, laugh instead.",1262822400,88,3620,4.88130081300813

3915526,3,B002E2M5IC,"Larry Gopnik is a middle aged man living in the 1967 American Midwest, with a simple, but familiar life routine. His faith, job, and family define his place in the community. It may be not much, but it is all he's got...

And from there, things get worse... Larry subconsciously reaches out to people around him for help (once by having a panic attack in his lawyer's office), only to be referred to a rabbi. And then to another one, and another one...

I read somewhere an opinion that A Serious Man was too esoteric to earn a wide audience following. I want to assure you that is NOT a reason NOT to see the film. I think one universal truth about humans is that, regardless of our individual religious affiliations, we all seek deeper meaning to our lives, past paying mortgage and taxes... The various rabbis the hero consults in order to help him make sense of his trials and tribulations may as well be imams or catholic priests. Larry's quest for the meaning to his suffering is akin to what most of us go thru at some point... All of which makes him a sympathetic character.

His wife wants a divorce, some anonymous person is trying to discredit his reputation, and a student is trying to manipulate Larry for better grads, and so on and so on Larry is a man like a leaf in the wind, who is caught in a world beyond his control.

3915530,5,B002E2M5IC,"My take on the opening scene is that it's the Coen Brothers version of the ""Messiah"" visiting us in human form. Like Jesus he is considered a threat and is prompty stabbed in the heart by the wife of the couple in the cabin. In case you didn't know it a dybuk is someone's dead sprit posessing a living person. This ""person"" came back to life after he died as the same person i.e. another Jesus"". He was not affected in any way by being stabbed and his last words are ""it's the last time I'm going to help anyone"". I just love the Coen brothers sense of humor. I am positive this is what they had in mind as a prelude to the movie.

IMHO this is one of the Coen Brothers best films and one that is unique in our time. I grew up in the period shown in the film and it really hit home, both as message about the fustrations of how life treats us and the futility of looking for answers from others (including rebbes and lawyers). Some people might consider this film anti-semetic and a bad representation of Jewish community by showing their frailities and obnoxiousness. However, if one looks beneath the serface and puts prejudice aside, I feel you will begin to see how we are all alike in our frailities and helplessness by how fate deals with us both as individuals and the people around us. This is a universal concept for all people. The open ended finale of the film is a testiment to this concept.

Also I think that the Coen Brothers have created a fantasy world based on Jewish allegories much like many of the famous story tellers in the past. In my mind they have updated the story of Bontshe Shveig from the ""The World of Sholom Aleichem"" (1959) (TV show). Its about a simple man who goes to heavan and is treated as the second coming of Jesus for his piety and innocence. Bontshe is played by the actor Jack Gilford. If you look at the facial expresions of Larry and Gilford they are almost identical. Also, during Bontshe's trial in Heavan it seems he was a pushover in life ie. everybody took advantage of him including his wife who divorced him and then kicked him out of their house forcing him to live in the streets as a begger. Sound familiar. After passing his trial in heaven, God asks Botshe if he would like anything in his kingdon as a reward for his humility and faith. Bontshe answers ""Dear God, could I please have everyday a piece of bread and a glass of water"".",1260057600,2,2391,4.334821428571429
3915531,5,B002E2M5IC,"I suspect it will take some time for critics and audiences to catch up with it, but ""A Serious Man"" is a great film -- bleak, challenging, mordantly funny, and shot through with profound implications.  Whenever a truly original work of cinematic art arrives in our midst, it is likely to be misunderstood -- check out the first reviews of Alain Resnais's ""Providence"" or, more recently, ""Magnolia.""

3915532,5,B002E2M5IC,"I suspect there is a chance that years from now, when we look back at the careers of the Coen Brothers, A SERIOUS  MAN may be considered to be among their finest work.  This is not to say that it is their most enjoyable movie, but it is a marvel of tone.  It is at once (not alternately) a comedy and a serious meditation on life, morals & ethics.  I frequently found myself laughing out-loud  while at the same time cringing with dismay.  It's an unsettling movie, full of dread...and yet full of joy.  The joy of seeing a film with pitch-perfect performances, great cinematography & art direction and a razor-sharp script.

I love the Coens, but even I must admit that some of their comedies are allowed to get flaccid and a little silly.  INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, THE LADYKILLERS and BURN AFTER READING had many joys...but no gravitas.  Remember the ending of THE LADYKILLERS?  It was actually quite bleak, with the crooks of the title failing utterly and in the end, joining a trashheap on a garbage ship.  Yet my feeling at the end was mostly bemusement.  In the Coens more serious work, such as NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, there is frequent comedy playing just below the surface...but it becomes less and less as the film builds to a relentless conclusion.  In BARTON FINK, the comedy gives way to drama and then to sheer, incomprehensible madness that left me, for one, mostly angry that the film had become quite so obtuse.  (Or maybe it was me who became obtuse.)

A SERIOUS MAN never stops being funny.  It also ends portentously, but the themes are quite crystal clear up through the final moment.

In some ways, we could see this film as a modern-day take on the story of Job.  We meet physics professor Larry Gopnik, just as his tidy, middle-class life begins to fall utterly to pieces.  He earns a modest living that allows him to keep his wife and two older kids in modest comfort in an early example of a subdivision (the film is set in 1967).  The kids are modestly troubled teens, they squabble, take Hebrew school less seriously than it should be...but there isn't anything too outside the range of acceptability.  They are a Jewish family living among gentiles, and this causes some dis-ease...but the Jewish community in their Minnesota town is strong and supportive.  In short, Larry is living a fairly normal life.  He's a meek man, slow to anger and slow to any shows of passion.  He believes there are right ways and wrong ways to do things...but he's always a tiny bit befuddled too.  It may be 1967, but he still seems perhaps a bit stuck in the `50s.

One day, a foreign student who is failing his class comes to him and is quite upset about his grades.  When Larry declines to reconsider, he is later delivered a hefty envelope full of cash...a bribe.  While he will not accept the bribe...he doesn't quite give the money back either.  In fact, he firsts throws out the idea of turning the boy in...but the boy threatens to turn HIM in for taking a bribe.  It becomes a hilariously circular argument, and more out of confusion that anything, Larry backs away from making a decision.

Then his wife announces she is leaving him.  She has a new man in her life, and she wants Larry to move out.  She's unclear on why this event has taken place...but Larry, ever the meek pussycat, goes along.  Unfortunately, his wife also obliges him to take along his very odd brother Arthur (Richard Kind), a social outcast who clearly suffers from both medical and mental ailments which today we might address, but in 1967, the family simply endures.  So Larry & Arthur live in a horrific motel room together...and Larry's life gets worse from there.  His kids get into trouble.  He comes to fear he may not make tenure.  His money woes increase.  And it gets worse and worse.

Larry will eventually be put to severe moral & ethical trials (Job-like again?)...and the film dares to suggest that God is taking a very serious look at Larry's case.  In fact, it's been a long time since a movie looked seriously at the role of religion in the lives of ordinary people who have an ordinary, non-extremist belief in religion.  A belief that embraces the role of religion (in this case, Judiasm) not only in the moral life but in the everyday social life as well.  These folks attend synagogue routinely, and as naturally as they draw breath.  Larry meets all the criteria of what most of us would call a ""good"" person...yet he is put through trials that would break many men.  Will they break him?

The movie is nearly perfectly acted.  Stuhlberg should be receiving Oscar buzz...although the movie has underperformed and I doubt he'll be remembered come nominating time.  Yet he is matched by everyone else in the film.  The Coen's are always great at casting folks who LOOK like the character they are playing.  So, even minor roles make an impact...we see the person for 3 seconds in extremely close-up, and we already have a pretty good idea of what kind of person this will be.  The movie, as with all Coen films, looks fabulous.  Art direction and costume direction are flawless and what is remarkable, they are beautiful too, even though all we're seeing is suburban Minnesota in the `60s.  Not exactly a setting most would call breathtaking...and yet it feels rich and complete.

As I indicate before, the film does not VEER from funny to serious.  It gives us both at once.  This is a testament to how well all elements were ""playing together.""  The script is revealing and sharp...no wasted words, and I mean that almost literally.  Every sentence uttered has meaning in either revealing character or revealing plot.  And the Coen's know when to let silence do the talking too.  The direction is rock-solid, indicated by the unity of approach that the actors use.  I think the mostly unfamiliar faces in the film allow it to obtain a believability that the casting of a ""star"" might have watered down.  The fact that the Coen's grasped this shows how committed they were to making the BEST film possible, not necessarily the most lucrative.  I've heard that the film is inspired by their own childhoods and the people they knew.  This is necessary to know, but it does help illuminate what I can't help but feel is an extra touch of loving care from these two artists who always lavish their films with so much attention.

While this is not a feel-good film by ANY stretch...it left me feeling joyful nonetheless, because it is a great example of film craftsmanship at its finest.  Much to my surprise, this film ranks high among the best of the year.",1258329600,5,6562,4.629116117850953

Larry Gopnick (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a Physics professor who, from the very start of the film, just can't seem to catch a break. He has a deadbeat brother living in his house, unforeseen events begin to threaten his chance to obtain tenure, his stoner son is days away from his bar mitzvah, and on top of all of that, his wife is demanding a divorce. As his life continues to spiral downward through a series of unforeseen and ill-timed events, Larry consults three different rabbis in a vein and desperate attempt to attach some semblance of meaning to all of this.

The problem with Larry and what makes all of this so trying for him is that he is a serious man.  For him, everything needs to be in its right place, and right now, nothing at all in his life is in order and he somehow needs to fix this. As the film goes on, it becomes clear that there aren't any answers for his problems. There is no rhyme or reason for anything that is happening to him. The Coen brothers message here is that what is happening to him isn't any punishment from ""Hashem"" (God) that he needs reconcile to make this all end. He's just going through life, and sometimes life can be a little rough. The opening quote of the movie can almost be thought of as a message to Larry; ""receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" Larry is just taking this all too seriously. When things go bad, he is looking for answers when, as the Jefferson Airplane song that plays throughout the film says, he just needs to ""find somebody to love"".

From a technical and visual perspective, the film is excellent, but the movie as a whole I felt was much too bleak and cynical. Because of this I felt alienated as a viewer and found it almost grueling to sit through at times. I guess I just hoped Larry would catch a break. After all he went through in this film, I guess I thought he deserved one.

  Grade: 6.4/10

Humorous movies, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raising-Arizona/dp/6305499128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raising Arizona</a>, The Big Lebowski;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intolerable-Cruelty-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00014SGKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intolerable Cruelty (Full Screen Edition)</a>, and the allegorical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>&nbsp;based on Homer's Odyssey, both featuring George Clooney in two of his best roles.  Gripping and more serious movies include Millers Crossing,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Simple-Director-s-Cut/dp/B00005LC4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Simple (Director's Cut)</a>, Fargo, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>.

In so doing they have received numerous nominations and won 5 Academy Awards for Best Director, Writing and Picture for No Country, and Best Director and Writing for Fargo.  Actors working with them have won Academy Awards: Frances McDormand for Fargo, and Javier Bardem for No Country.  Frances is married to Joel Coen.

A Serious Man marks a continuation, a departure, and a progression in their work.

In No Country, thematically, people died randomly, and suddenly, and as a friend remarked. 'they never saw it coming.'  Sometimes neither did we.  People spoke of a nihilistic philosophy underpinning the movie.

Nihilism proposes that life and events have no inherent meaning or purpose, no rhyme or reason. In a contrasting philosophy when someone dies one might say that's karma, or they got what they deserved, or in the greater scheme of things, it makes sense.

It's 1967, midwest suburbia.  Larry Blotnick, physics professor, up for tenure, has it all figured out or so he thinks, then things happen which make him search for meaning and answers.  His blackboard is filled with formulas.  Shrodingers Cat can be reduced to a formula, but he admits he does not understand the story. A failing student understands the cat, but not the math.

Anonymous letters threaten Larry's tenure bid.  Blackmail, bribery, Sy Ableman happen, and throw him into crisis.  No formula, no uncertainty principle, can explain what's happening.  Larry is immediately recognisable as the everyman protagonist.  If you're like me you recognise yourself as having walked in those shoes, and yet it's all done with humor, and you will root for this guy.

You hope that he gets it on with the attractive nude sunbathing female neighbor.  His quest for answers take him to three different rabbis, with three different responses, and maybe Jefferson Airplane has the answers, and maybe there is no answer, maybe there is no point, and maybe you need to 'accept the mystery.'

I predict that you will scratch your head and wonder about the first scene, and how it relates to the rest of the movie.  I don't know.  Maybe there is no point, and that's the point. Hope you find this helpful. I particularly liked the intricate stylised humor, and quirkiness of the characters.

Even though on the surface it may not be as universally appealing as No Country, if you look a little deeper it may be the most universally relevant movie they have done.",1257638400,4,3666,6.417515274949084
3915536,5,B002E2M5IC,"Larry Gopnik is a physics professor and family man who suddenly finds his life turned upside down. It starts when his wife takes up with Sy Ableman and continues with a seemingly endless stream of moral, legal and financial problems. Most people would fight back with a fury. But Gopnik has a timid and indecisive temperament, the kind that allows others to walk all over him while he wonders what he is doing wrong.

He goes to see two junior rabbis. They bring up issues related to God that has Gopnik questioning himself even further. But, stil feeling unsatisfied, he has a driving need to see Rabbi Marshak. However the senior rabbi is unwilling to talk with anyone besides boys who have just had their bar mitsvah. The film ends abruptly and with a sense of impending doom that leaves Gopnik more confused and doubting himself than ever.

I really loved this movie and I'm disappointed that it hasn't seemed to garner the widespread acclaim of the Coen brothers' ""No Country For Old Man"". But maybe it's very Jewish characters are difficult for some people to relate to. Personally, as an atheist ""goy"", I found Gopnik's struggles to be universal and enjoyed the movie's religious imagery and biblical references. Suburban life in the late 60's was also beautifully captured, including Gopnik's nervous lusting for a sunbathing neighbor. I especially enjoyed the subplot involving Gopnik' teen-age son, as his pot smoking, Jefferson Airplane listening and general rebelliousness signal the social changes occurring. The best film I have seen this year. Don't miss it!",1257552000,2,1573,5.0
3915537,1,B002E2M5IC,"All right.  I got the biblical allusions in A SERIOUS MAN, such as the story of Job, the temptation of David, yada yada yada.  That still doesn't mean that there was much of a story or for that matter--character development and plot--in this poor excuse of a movie.  This is the type of film that gives arthouse cinema a bad name.  I never felt so bored in my life.  If the Coen brothers wanted to make a movie of a physics professor who is tortured by his everyday life--fine.  But don't torture your audience at the same time.  I find the Coen brothers to be wildly inconsistent in the quality of their films--much like Steven Soderbergh.  They'll make brilliant films like Fargo and No Country For Old Men and then losers like this one, Barton Fink, The Man Who Wasn't There, Ladykillers, etc.  Not recommended at all.  Instead, go see Amreeka.",1257292800,6,847,4.549668874172186
3915538,3,B002E2M5IC,"Larry Gopnik is a middle aged man living in the 1967 American Midwest, with a simple, but familiar life routine. His faith, job, and family define his place in the community. It may be not much, but it is all he's got... One day however, he finds this routine deeply interrupted: his wife asks him for a divorce; his job is threatened by poison pen letters; his brilliant, but socially dysfunctional brother moves in with him, unable to hold down a job. And from there, things get worse... Larry subconsciously reaches out to people around him for help (once by having a panic attack in his lawyers office), only to be referred to a rabbi. And then to another one, and another one...

I read somewhere an opinion that A Serious Man was too esoteric to earn a wide audience following. I want to assure you that is NOT a reason NOT to see the film. I think one universal truth about humans is that, regardless of our individual religious affiliations, we all seek deeper meaning to our lives, past paying our mortgage and taxes... The various rabbis the hero seeks out in order to help him make sense of his trials and tribulations may as well be imams or catholic priests. Larry's quest for the meaning to his suffering is akin to what most of us go thru at some point... All of which makes him a sympathetic character. The story, as told by the brothers Coen, is witty and engaging; the lessons are true and wise. Be ready for little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought. This is definitely a film best appreciated when one is in a ruminative mood. However, the lessons could as well be told in three sentences or less, rather then an hour and twenty five minutes of film. If you are a linear thinker, you may find the pace of the story frustrating.",1256601600,35,1780,4.460122699386503

8366787,2,B002E2M5IC,"A highly competent achievement by the Coen brothers: the screen play revealed so many nuances of the characters; while a slow moving movie, it never dragged, the actors were subtler and effective in their portrayals. But I downgrade this film because underlying all of it is its pervasive nihilism. Except for Larry Gopnik, the other characters are relentlessly egotistical. His wife has the self-awareness of a 14 year old. Her lover, Abe, is manipulative to a degree that is painful to watch ( although, as a character,  still a masterpiece of construction by the Coens). Judaism (presumably all religions) is an empty collection of traditions managed by rabbis who either have the depth of Hallmark greeting cards or who are pompous blowhards. There is an amusing scene of Larry teaching quantum physics in the classroom in which he affirms that at the bottom of it all is meaninglessness (even though he still later visits the rabbis in the hope of discovering God's expectations of him). The goy hate him, but then the Coens are fully contemptuous of the goy. What is sad, but also part of the nihilism is that after all the defeats and humiliations, when his doomed fate begins to relent a little and his marriage appears to recover its former (external!) form, Larry is eager to resume what he has learned is only empty pretence. In no way has Larry learned anything (what is there to learn since it is all meaningless?). (I wish to point out a piece of extraordinary treachery by Abe, which is revealed in a single line, nearly a throw- away late in the movie, the inattentive viewer might miss it, but this is the man Larry's wife hopes to find a superior relationship with). Actually, Larry does change a little at the end: he becomes corrupt.

And now, a political comment: Europe is now facing a replacement of Western values by a far more dynamic Islam. No wonder, if the creators of contemporary culture such as the Coens see that culture as fully empty, flaccid, meaningless. I found this movie both amusing and destructive. To use the old phrase: amusing ourselves to death.",1512086400,,2090,4.786703601108033
