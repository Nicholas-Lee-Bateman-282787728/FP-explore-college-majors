This is not a commercial entertainment film. If you are looking for that, bypass Bergman's movies and move on to the Hollywood blockbusters; there's nothing here to see. This one, perhaps more so than some of his others, is intellectual. Viewing only the superficial surface of it passively gives a story that comes across quite flat with a somewhat tragic ending.

Bergman's Upbringing and Background:
Ingmar Bergman's background is important to understanding his films better. He was the son of a very strict Swedish Lutheran minister who rose to become a religious adviser to the Swedish queen. Through a Glass Darkly continues Bergman's wrestling with the existence of God, and what He is, if He does exist. Bergman doesn't provide answers, but he does provoke questions. It's a theme that pervades other films preceding this one. We see ""The Seventh Seal"" in which a knight wants confirmation of God's existence when Death comes to claim him, which Death will not answer. Feeling he has not lead a worthy life, having spent it in futility with great disillusionment in The Crusades, delays Death with a chess game. Without spoiling it, the knight ultimately does accomplish something he feels worthy, and Death ultimately claims him, but without knowing an answer to his question of God's existence. Then we see a year prior, ""The Virgin Spring"" in which the father, whose daughter was robbed (of her fine clothing), raped and murdered, and who has wreaked revenge in killing the three who raped and killed her. Set in medieval Sweden between as it was being Christianized, we see a mix of heathen and early Christian practices. The father ultimately questions how God could allow such a cruel and painful death to his innocent young daughter, and allow him to murder her murderers in revenge.

The Film Title's Biblical Reference:
In ""Through a Glass Darkly"" we see its title's reference to the new testament biblical metaphor from First Corinthians 13, the first epistle written by Paul and Sosthenes to the Christians in Corinth. Exact wording depends on translation and interpretation of ""glass"" as being a glass pane or a metal mirror (and some translations use ""mirror""). Either way, what was used as ""glass"" then is assuredly not what we know to be glass today, less than clear and lacking flat surfaces. Mirrors then were polished metal plates (usually brass) that often came with sponge containing fine pumice to polish it. They also were not that flat. Looking through a ""glass"" or at a reflection in a mirror was known to give distorted images lacking fine detail and dimmer than what one would see directly. The ""glass"" or ""mirror"" interpretation doesn't matter, as it's the metaphor's meaning that's important. Paul and Sosthenes tell the Corinthians in this chapter that 'love"" is the most important among the virtues, overriding all others, and characterizing what it is, but that we cannot know God completely in our worldly existence.

Now enter into the film itself, with a ""chamber"" cast of only four ostensibly on an island holiday, consisting of a widower father with a married daughter, young teenage son, and the daughter's husband. The tiny cast allows character development in substantial depth and the nature of these characters are not only revealed by their own actions, they are reflected in the dialog of others. It isn't long before this family of four reveals itself comprised of dysfunctional members, with its dysfunctions amplified by the daughter's schizophrenia, for which she had been treated beginning to recur with bouts of increasing severity (mental disease isn't stated but the symptoms are classic schizophrenic). Her expectation with the people she sees and voices she hears, is a coming of God for her with those people and that she must obey them. Ultimately her ""vision"" of God . . . or a god of some type, or perhaps a demon . . . as imagined in her schizophrenic delusions (interpret this as you will) . . . is revealed at the end, with another revelation of what the father considers God to be in a dialog with his son that immediately follows and ends the film. Bergman's interpretation of the content and meaning of First Corinthians 13 is played out with each of the characters expressing different portions of it. The audience is left to accept or reject it, in whole or in part, each to their own interpretation of God and Love, as they also perceive it for themselves, through a glass, darkly. That God remains ""silent"" throughout is pervasive of Bergman's films, not answering the questions his characters ask, but leaving his characters to answer those for themselves. The daughter's ""revelation"" is clearly a schizophrenic delusion, but even in the depths of her disease and psychological breakdown it's clear she also wants her question(s) about the nature of God to be answered.

This is a film, due to its depth, that bears watching more than once, especially for English-speakers that must use the subtitles, the dubbed English dialog track, or both. I recommend using both as their translations from Swedish to English have some differences. I found it easier to comprehend the film with these dialog interpretations combined which give a better sense of the original Swedish dialog's intent and meaning.

Bergman Film Casting (in general):
He spent many of his years directing plays during the autumn, winter and early spring, and directing his films during the theater's off season during the summer. Many of the same actors used in his stage plays were also used in his films.

Rating:
Through a Glass Darkly is unrated by the MPAA because it has never been submitted, which should not be a surprise. It was not made for US commercial distribution and was generally shown in art house theaters like most foreign films, and they generally didn't care if a film was unrated. I doubt given widespread knowledge about its content now that it ever will be. The MPAA tiered rating system as we know it today did not exist in 1961. Films were evaluated under a Draconian ""one size fits all"" Hays Code, and were issued a serial numbered certificate displayed in the credits if it passed all the Hays Code criteria. Most theaters would not rent films that failed getting a certificate, and avoided ""unrated"" films (those not submitted) unless there was considerable critical acclaim and public demand (which did occur, but was rare). I would guess a PG-13 rating if submitted today although it's conceivable that it might be granted a PG purely on lack of violence, lack of cursing, and its very mild explicit sexual content (with subtle allusion hinted at in dialog for a very mature encounter). IMHO a PG would be badly misguided. Its subject matter is intellectually quite mature and would be lost on most younger than about 15-16 years old, which are the minimum ages in the UK, Finland and Sweden ratings which use similar but not identical criteria to the current MPAA system.",1432252800,3,6959,4.938514090520922
8352974,5,B0026KW0M8,I'm not going to write a movie critic's review of this film.  I will simply say that this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made and any serious movie buff should have it in his collection.,1377820800,,196,4.157894736842105
8352975,5,B0026KW0M8,"I have watched nearly every Bergman film, and count him among my favorite directors of all time.  I would say that this is one of his most puzzling and one of the most though provoking, though I felt Wild Strawberries and 7th Seal were better films.  In all of these films, created in the middle, and arguably best years of Bergman's career, there is the persistent question: is there a God? and if so, what are we humans here for?

Through a Glass Darkly is the first in Bergman's 'Trilogy'.  Bergman himself admitted that the three films were a trilogy and all connected.  Each questions the existence of God, but neither admits He exists nor denies His existence.

This is not in the same vein as the Magician, in which Bergman portrays his career and his critics in a tongue in cheek fashion.  But in this film we do see a bit of questioning as to what it takes to create a story, and what the author gives up.  This could be construed to apply towards Bergman as a director.  If you watch the 15 minute discussion with Peter Cowie on this version (the Criterion DVD), then you will gain some enlightenment.  But do watch it after the film.  There are a few mentions of goings on in the next two films of this trilogy, but no spoilers.

The film has a pretty straightforward plot: an author is using his daughter's schizophrenia as a source for his writing.  His son seems to be suffering from his own form on mental illness and at times we see the insinuation that brother and sister have had an incestuous relationship.  The only other character is the husband to the daughter, a physician, though it is not entirely clear if he married her after her 'treatments' or was with her before her illness.

With only four characters, the viewer really gets into the mind of each.  We see them for what they are, which is flawed.  The stark setting (actually filmed on an island off the Swedish coast), is the perfect backdrop.  There are moments of silence in this film, which some consider 'boring' but I consider dramatic and emotional.  Each of the actors is well suited to their roles.  Max Von Sydow is always remarkable, but this is the one film where he is overshadowed by a stronger female lead, Harriet Andersson.  Andersson really owns the show here, but Gunnar Bjrnstrand who plays her father, is also terrific.

  Another interesting inclusion in this film was the scene with the play.  Bergman was often fond of inserting plays (doubtless from his years of theater directing and producing).  We see the plays within the film in Smiles of a Summer Night, The Magician, and others.

Despite this version being an earlier Criterion release, it is a solid release.  There aren't many features, so it is a bare bones release.  You have the discussion with Cowie and then a booklet with an essay.  I would say that if you are fond of this film, then buy the much better release of the entire Trilogy:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ingmar-Bergman-Trilogy-Through-a-Glass-Darkly-Winter-Light-The-Silence-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0000A02TX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ingmar Bergman Trilogy (Through a Glass Darkly / Winter Light / The Silence) (The Criterion Collection)</a>",1344556800,4,3235,4.970204841713222
8352976,5,B0026KW0M8,"Bergman is still dealing with some of the same big issues (Is there a
god?, What's the meaning of art?, etc.) but now on a much more human
level. The preachiness is gone, and the characters are no longer
archetypes. Just human beings struggling with the difficulties of
living.

Phenomenal, understated performances all around, and beautiful
cinematography more than compensate for occasional hints of staginess
in this chamber drama with just 4 characters; a father, his son and
schizophrenic daughter, and her husband who loves her in spite of her
illness.

All the characters are human, identifiable, occasionally ugly, and
true. And somehow this led to me thinking much more deeply about my own
life then the impressive, but more on-the-nose cosmic questioning of
'The Seventh Seal' or even 'Wild Strawberries'.",1334880000,3,815,5.213740458015267
