3447148,2,B001AD8FXK,"I am a classic movie buff and enjoy watching any film to do with ancient Egypt.  But I was not quite enthralled by this version of Queen Nefertiti.  Both Jean Crain and Edmund Pardom's acting was quite wooden at times, with the worst from Vincent Price who was completely miscat in the role of a priest.  The dialogue was not brilliant either.  I found, on the whole, entertaining in that it was about ancient Egypt, but for those who are not quite so enthusiastic, then I would definitely give this film a miss.",1220918400,8,512,4.473118279569892
3447149,5,B001AD8FXK,"Beautiful film! This captures the days when Hollywood got a hold of ancient history and made it ""modern."" The hilarious script, The costumes from Motley, the color of the print, not too different from its first release, and the acting. Everyone gets a chance here to forget anything they ever learned about screen acting. Some of the cast never left the Queen of the Nile and her camp.

Buy this film and revel in a time now gone with the wind.",1454112000,,444,4.481481481481482
3447150,3,B001AD8FXK,"I did not really like this movie to much, the color was bad and to dark and the sound wasn't to good either.
I would not recommend this move to anybody.",1442620800,,152,3.935483870967742

3447154,3,B001AD8FXK,"Routine biblival saga made in Italy.  Jeanne Crain and Edmond Purdom are lovers and want a life together.  However, self-serving proest Vincent
Price has his own reasons for wanted Crain to marry someone of greater importance.  Palace and political manipulations to control power at all
costs.  Harmless and moves with pace and purpose.  Spectacle is more implied than delivered however.",1425772800,4,387,5.383333333333334

3447156,5,B001AD8FXK,"I am not sure why anyone would expect a this film or ""The Egyptian"", ""The Land of the Pharaohs"" or even ""Cleopatra"" to be historically accurate?!! Consider the time they were made! Well, still, we want glamorous, romantic versions that are so far from the true story. Watch ""Reign"" or The Tudors""-I am a history professor and I can tell ya those are so far from fact, but fun, none the less!
This is not Criterion, pricey art-house, beautifully restored to look better than when it premiered, this is put out by a company called Sinister Cinema, who doesn't remaster, they take fun and campy, hard-to-find films like this and print them, then sell them at a great price! I love Sinister! It is not a bad print, even.
Jeanne Crain is beautiful, Vincent Price is outrageous and the whole film is a lot of fun! I highly recommend a double feature with ""Land of the Pharaohs"", with Joan Collins, a few cocktails and your best friends!",1419379200,11,930,4.574850299401198

3447160,3,B001AD8FXK,"Edmund Purdom made two movies about the same subject, The Egyptian and this one The Queen of the Nile.  Set in the Time period when the Pharaoh Aminophis changed his name to  Akhnaton and changed the worship of many Gods to the God Atun.  In ""Queen"" Purdom falls for a young woman named Merit, who becomes Nefertiti.  Vincent Price is the Evil father of Merit and fights for the old Gods of Egypt.  Historically it not very true to history.  Akhnaton had a son who became ""King Tut"" and in this movie the Pharaoh dies before his son is born. The DVD seems washed out and old.  It is not a bad movie, but does not come close to the Quality and excellence of  The Egyptian, which is a much better movie.",1409184000,5,701,4.257575757575758

3447162,3,B001AD8FXK,"""Cleopatra"" this ain't, but for me, it will always have a camp place in my heart because of the performance of Vincent Price who reminds me of Judith Anderson in the Rita Hayworth version of ""Salome"". I think they even wear similar jewelry and head pieces.",1408060800,3,256,4.586956521739131

3447166,1,B001AD8FXK,"Queen of the Pile

Lousy storyline. For sheer boredom, this one takes the cake. Only recommended for those who need a little more excitement than watching the plants grow.",1376352000,3,171,4.896551724137931
3447167,2,B001AD8FXK,"I'd rate this movie only fair.  Very soap-opera-ish, and historically quite inacurate (which rankles with an Egyptian history ""nut"" like myself.  Entertaining if you have nothing else to watch.  Jeanne Crain was lovely and dignified, however.",1374278400,4,242,5.666666666666667
3447168,3,B001AD8FXK,"I expected a better movie , considering the actors that are in it. The plot was cheesy and not very believable. I would not recommend this movie.",1364256000,2,145,4.407407407407407

3447170,1,B001AD8FXK,"This might have been a cool movie, but I couldn't tell from this DVD. Although obviously shot in widescreen, the image here is cropped to a boxy square and looks faded and beat up. It was so bad I didn't even bother to finish watching the movie. My advice would be to wait for a proper DVD release.",1302134400,24,298,4.155172413793103
3447171,2,B001AD8FXK,"As anything, good, bad or indifferent on Ancient Egypt interests me, this was my reason for purchasing this product. Beautiful as she was, Jeanne Crain is hardly anybody's idea of a queen of the Nile. Resemblence to actual history was purely accidental, but I was entertained and what better reason for watching a sword and sandal epic?",1285286400,15,336,4.912280701754386
3447172,1,B001AD8FXK,"Frankly, I am always interested in seeing old films (the Kitchier the better).  But I also like quality.  Sinister has claimed to be the directors and to have the rights to these films, but they do no justice to them with the poor quality of the reproduction.  Also, they do not represent themselves in a straight forward manner.  They should state in the description of the film who they are, what they do, what rights they have and then give a synopsis of the film itself.  That way, no one can mistake the film they order to be a direct release from the studio.  I believe they are acting in an underhanded way.",1283817600,21,614,4.389380530973451
3447173,1,B001AD8FXK,Again this video has very very poor video quality and not made to fit your screen,1281744000,6,81,4.125
3447174,2,B001AD8FXK,"This ""Queen of the Nile"" is in fact the English-language dubed version of the 1961 Italian ""Nefertiti, regina del Nilo"", one of those somewhat megalomaniac Italian productions that feed on an American or English actor/actress to lend it some weight. In this case, the only really well known actor is Vincent Price, who carries his role well. Of course, when the heard word travels a different course from the lip movement of the actors, one doesn't quite know whether to laugh or cry. The plot is quite different from the historic version of egyptologists, introducing love triangles that the ""official"" archeological data and speculation laugh at; that drowns the plot into the liquid of far-fetched bad fiction. Both sound and image on the dvd are of very poor quality, making some of the lines very difficult to understand. I gave it two stars given my personal interest in films related to Ancient Egypt, which are very few, especially when some historic accuracy is seeked, othewise a 1-star classification would be quite adequate given very poor sound and image as well as a poor, far-fetched plot.",1280707200,29,1104,4.972972972972973

 The color is very good,the print is sharp,though only Pan & Scan.

 also Sinister Cinema do not put out bootleg films,they have the rights to release them.

 Yes it would be nice to see  a Widescreen version,but 20th Century Fox,wont release it.,maybe one day
 It never even came out on VHS.

 Anyway the this version is Highly Recommended",1246665600,48,422,4.830985915492958

This movie quality is reprehensible. The DVD format was pulled off of a VHS tape. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM SINISTER CINEMA. They are extraordiarily cheaply made, attempting to pass off the movies as professionally released. It's a lie they keep telling people.

Their name tells the truth: Sinister Cinema. It's a throwback title from the 1970s, a TV show every saturday night that would show horror flicks. Yes, they are still horrible.",1466640000,6,517,4.797752808988764
