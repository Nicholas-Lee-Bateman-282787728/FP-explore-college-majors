8396315,4,B003G2ZOZU,Very good. Didnt realise what models have to go through to get a good picture. Hard work i think.,1435622400,,97,4.157894736842105
8396316,2,B003G2ZOZU,"Some videos show you good quality film as well as idea about the model and work that goes into a video. Other videos offer a delight in the soft-core side by showing lots of naked girls or a very long video of one girl.

This video is more about just showing the girls on the video with background music. This is more of a ""Playboy Wanna-be"". You can't hear what the models are saying and there's also no info about the photographers who works with this video. This video is mostly about seeing naked girls and that's about it. Not that there's anything wrong with see naked girls, but I was expecting some kind of feedback, like more info about what went into the photography and more about the style of photography as well as the work that went into making this video. Instead, it was a very ""Playboy-esque"" but without sound, just music.

The interviews are more about the models, but they are all dressed up. Plus, the models were hard to understand since some were obviously not from USA or UK. (Subtitles would have been nice so I could understand them more)

Also, the supposed 100+ photos are a self running slideshow, not actual JPG files that you can get from the DVD.

Overall it's not a very bad video, the quality is actually pretty good. But the video doesn't offer a lot of substance, just models with music backgrounds and interviews that were hard to understand what they were saying. (Not a very big problem, unless you have a hard time understand their accent)",1426464000,2,1479,4.52808988764045
8396317,1,B003G2ZOZU,"I purchased this movie as part of a ""package deal"".  I sent it back to Amazon and received about half the purchase price back.  I consider myself lucky!  This is a very poorly made movie that has no value or purpose.  Basically, buyers are paying for the producer's trip to other countries.  These are not the models that one would expect based on the title.  I'm certain that they must be nice people, but I wouldn't consider them to be models.  Buy a Play Boy dvd instead.  You'll be much more satisfied.  If you are an ammature photographer seeking professional tips on how to take better photos, you won't get them from this dvd.",1292630400,23,633,4.482456140350878
8396318,1,B003G2ZOZU,"Watching this was a waste of time.  This DVD involves a photographer taking pics of several nude models.  It's all pretty boring, there is nothing noteworthy going on.  Afterwards they do an interview of the model, but she is clothed (a nude in ""nature"" but clothed, come on!)  This was a big disappointment and I cannot recommend it.",1285027200,39,334,4.706896551724138
8396319,3,B003G2ZOZU,It doesn't really provide much information about nude photography but is entertaining enough for the price.  The 'Nude in Nature' title had me expecting some nudist style photography but this is more of the typical mild erotic style adult photography.  If you find Family Naturism photography or videography a fun escape then the real Naturist DVDs on Amazon from RussianBare are really the best but they do cost more.  If your looking for some fun posed shots this DVD will deliver.,1282089600,26,483,4.938271604938271
8396320,2,B003G2ZOZU,"This was not a good DVD for learning how to take photos of models.  In fact, it didn't give anything at all about how to take photos.  I learn nothing at all from this DVD.  This DVD is nothing more than a soft core porn DVD, not that there is anything wrong with that.  However, this DVD should have been teaching people about how to take photos.",1280707200,7,347,4.134328358208955
