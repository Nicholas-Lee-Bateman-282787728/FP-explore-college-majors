8003763,3,B0000VLL7K,The Hunted is fairly weak story wise but heavy on the action. The character of Rei (this time played by Mikiyo Ono) takes time away from her job in Zero Force to help an old childhood friend and takes a second job as a waitress to help a potential love interest. A sub plot involving another shadow ops agency is woven throughout and is not the main plot as described on the back cover. Overall not a bad film but for fans of the franchise only.,1412553600,,445,4.186046511627907
8003764,1,B0000VLL7K,I never bought this DVD in the end due to some confusion on the seller part: merchant(ShopTech4Less) could not locate the outer insert for this DVD. I did get the refund though!,1223596800,,177,4.5625
8003765,3,B0000VLL7K,"I am fan of the zero woman movies, because there is not one woman who stars in the epic more than once. Also the women that star in the series are pretty sext and tight. Acting is ok, special effects suck, but not always a bad story. Don't pay more than $7 for any of the videos",1206748800,5,278,3.8947368421052633
