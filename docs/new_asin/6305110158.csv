8676610,5,6305110158,"I first saw this movie when I was 11 (18 now) and it is my favorite movie of all time.  It's everything I ever dreamed of -- I was a lot like that girl, and to meet with an indian spirit in the body of a wolf?  Myth and reality blend into an amazing adventure; have I mentioned the beautiful scenery?  Especially when you hear the scream of an eagle...anyway, there's also a ton of humor that cracks me up every time.  I think I've rented this movie a dozen times.  All of the characters work well together; especially the girl's father and sisters.  If you like nature and Indian myth, you'll love this.",1088035200,8,604,4.254385964912281
8676611,1,6305110158,"I did not like this movie one bit.  I'm the type of person that will take at least one good thing out of a movie and say that the movie was not that bad, but this movie was horrible.  I would have given it a different rating  but they didn't have negative stars.  I was sick about seven years ago and  my mother rented it for me.  After watching it, I think I was even sicker.  Seven years later this film still haunts me.  I did the search and couldn't  believe that it was found.  People always ask me: ""have you ever not  liked a movie?"" and I reply: ""only one, Legend of Wolf  Mountain"" Greg - 17",913075200,4,600,3.9915254237288136
