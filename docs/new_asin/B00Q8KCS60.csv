6864171,2,B00Q8KCS60,"There are plenty of reasons to like Ethan Hawke, but his choosiness in the films he stars in is not one of them. He's a lot like Forest Whitaker, really; both are generally good for one excellent performance in a well-regarded movie per year. The rest is surrounded by absolute crap that Nicolas Cage might scoff at. In Hawke's case, we've seen him star in two acclaimed movies of the last couple of years: Before Midnight and Boyhood, the latter possibly earning him some awards hardware. But he's also been in too many clunkers to count (hello Getaway!). His latest film, the time twisting sci-fi film Predestination isn't quite one of Hawke's worst duds, but it wastes a wonderfully loopy premise by getting lost in all the swerves.

The film starts off promisingly cool, with a slickly presented showdown between an unknown bomber and the agent sent to stop him. Both men have their faces hidden in shadow, which combined with the movie's title is probably enough to give away the ultimate payoff. When the agent fails to stop the bomb and it goes off in his face, he uses a time travel device hidden in a violin case, to jump a few years into the future. There his face is completely reconstructed by his employers, a temporal agency charged with preventing disasters throughout history. The agent's task has been to stop the unfortunately-named Fizzle Bomber, and has been traveling up and down the timestream trying to do just that. The effects can be pretty lousy on the brain; a point which we know will come into play later.

So it's a sweet setup with a ton of potential, but as soon as it gets going the story takes an odd narrative turn. The agent (now played by Hawke) goes back in time and sets up shop as a Manhattan bartender. His night is disrupted by an odd patron named John who calls himself the Unmarried Woman who begins a story about his incredible life. At first it's hard to figure what's up, but then it becomes clear that this man is actually a woman (Sarah Snook), and she begins a dragging, overlong story about how she was a brilliant student who became involved with some space program, had a child with a mysterious stranger, had a forced sex change, and somewhere in there became a writer of confessional rags. While some of this would be entertaining in small doses, it seems to go on forever until you begin to wonder if it's even the same movie. During all of this time, Hawke is basically there just sitting in silence. It's not an exaggeration to say this goes on for about 40 minutes, nearly to the end of the 90-minute film.

It's hard to go much further without giving something away, but Predestination is basically one complicated jigsaw puzzle, made more complicated because some of the pieces don't exactly fit. Robert Heimlein's 1958 short story served as the source material, and it sets up the story with a minimum of baggage that writers/directors the Spierig Brothers pile on into one giant paradox. There's a mystery behind absolutely everything and much of it isn't worth the trouble. Who is the Fizzle Bomber? Who is the bartender, really? What's the significance of John becoming Joan? Why is this secret agency of time cops interested in all of this? How is it all connected? As the jukebox plays Lonzo and Oscar's 1947 goof song ""I'm My Own Grandpa"", the answers become pretty obvious.

Despite the big reveal being telegraphed from a couple of light years away, Predestination still manages to botch the execution in other ways. Snook's multi-faceted, dual-gendered performance is truly a revelation. She goes from a feisty and striking redhead to an introverted, barely-recognizable man with the weight of a sad past on his shoulders. It's unfortunate that so much of her character's story doesn't jibe with the sci-fi elements that take over later on. As for Hawke, he's perfectly suited to the role of a man who has felt the incredible toll of time travel. He deserves a better film than the Spierig's give him here, and since they also directed him in the terrible vampire flick Daybreakers it's the second time they've let him down. ""Fool me once, shame on you....""",1420675200,12,4128,4.713296398891967
6864172,4,B00Q8KCS60,"If you are looking for a movie that will make you think or worthy of an oscar nomination than this film is not for you. Neither is it an action filled scifi drama. In my opinion the premise of the film is like a hidden gem. Not many movies are like this. It is convoluted at times and that ending left me confused to what really happened. There are plot holes and some might be enraged at the ending. It is kind of hard to explain the plot of the movie to anyone who has not seen it because the magic of the film is in the plot. I found the story to be compelling and I was engaged in the story of Jane. Jane's story is remarkable and a blast to experience and I think it was the overall goal of the movie. To let the viewers see the life of Jane and connect the dots on what happened. The movie was an entertaining piece that I enjoyed to pass the time. It wasn't an award making movie nor a big hit blockbuster action flick. But somehow I just really liked the way it played out. I am sure that many other viewers might see it the same way.

I must applaud the acting of Sarah Snook in this movie. She is the air and life force of this movie and is what kept making me watch all through to the end of the film. Her performance was brilliant and such a joy to watch. I am not the biggest fan of Ethan Hawke but he did a decent job as well. I believe after this movie, directors may be fighting for Sarah Snook to be in their films. She is a beauty and delivered one of the best acting performances for the beginning of this years films.

This movie will either be a hit or miss to the person who is watching it, but for me it was a fun joy ride.",1420243200,7,1646,3.9251497005988023
6864173,4,B00Q8KCS60,"Ethan Hawke stars as an agent of a time travel law enforcement agency trying to stop a bomber from leveling a large section of New York City.  While the basic plot summary makes Predestination sound like a straightforward sci-fi flick like Timecop or the more ambitious Twelve Monkeys the actual films defies expectations in ways that are both good and bad.

Predestination only seems to be about an attempt to stop a terrorist bomber--that concrete goal turns out to be entirely besides the point as Predestination's plot unfolds in a very unusual way--as a very long story told by a customer to a bartender.  The story will likely make the viewer wonder what happened to the sci-fi action film that the opening scene of Predestination promised--the lengthy flashback might judge the patience of many viewers but it eventually pays off in ways that are unexpected.

Australian filmmakers the Spierig Brothers previously made the handsome but dopey vampire flick Daybreakers which also starred Ethan Hawke.  They still show more talent for visuals than storytelling but this time rather than coming up with their own original material they are adapting a classic short story by Robert A Heinlein which provides a far sturdier narrative skeleton to build their screenplay around than they had with their previous features Daybreakers (2009) and Undead (2003).  Most of the plot twists in Predestination come straight out of the short story so the brothers only had to flesh out the scenes and add their visual talent.

The end result is still a movie that probably would have been better written by someone else--Predestination aims to blow viewer minds but never quite gets there.  Still, Predestination  boasts some of the most ambitious genre storytelling seen outside the films of Christopher Nolan and even if it never quite works as intended it's a movie that thoughtful viewers are likely to enjoy turning over in their heads for days afterwards.

Ethan Hawke is suitably haunted as the agent who knows more than he initially lets on but ultimately much less than he thinks.  Sarah Snook gives a winning performance that only makes sense after a large portion of the movie has gone by--initially her acting seems weird and mannered but it turns out to be perfectly calibrated for the tricky narrative.

Predestination is ultimately a good science fiction film but not a great one--it's entirely possible that the Spierig Brothers are incapable of making a great film.  But even if that's the case Predestination is a welcome improvement over Daybreakers and a film that's far more ambitious and demanding than your typical genre fare.  Adventurous viewers will find Predestination more than worthwhile, although those looking for lots of action and special effects should probably steer clear or expect to be very bored.",1420070400,2,2826,5.088744588744588
6864174,3,B00Q8KCS60,"Finally, ""All you zombies"", Robert Heinlein's spectacular short story, was made into a movie. By its own nature, it was almost impossible to render such a plot into a movie, so what the film does on that area is remarkable.
Perhaps the short story was too short for a feature film, or perhaps it was regarded as too ""passive"", too intellectual, but the screenwriters attached to it a second subplot, about a crazy serial bomber. How well this digression adds itself to the basic Heinlein's postulate is a matter for debate. I was surprised how the film makers managed to doing it quite acceptably, but ultimately I wasn't totally satisfied (this is, maybe, one time-loop too many and coherency might have suffered in the process).
If I were mean, I could say that this film is good and original, but that the good parts are not original (but Heinlein's) while the original parts are not that good. But that would be an exaggerated criticism.
In spite of those reservations I do recommend watching it. I think it will be a unique visual experience of the all-time most convoluted and most justifiably famous time-travel-contradictions' story (Heinlein's) very aptly rendered into a film.",1419206400,27,1186,4.9054726368159205
6864175,5,B00Q8KCS60,Absolutely pleasantly surprised with the quality of the plot and the texture of the cinematography. Well worth a viewing.,1419120000,,121,5.421052631578948
6864176,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Predestination isn't just the best sci-fi of the year, it's one of the best sci-fi's I've seen since Minority Report or Gattaca. It's one of the best films of the year, period. It's one of the most thought-provoking, mind-bending, sharply written, fiercely original, technically adept, emotionally moving, and powerfully acted science fiction films I've ever seen. Is it ""Great great"" - like Inception/Gattaca great? Only time will tell, so I'll leave that up to you.

Based on Robert Heinlein's short story All You Zombies, a mind-bending, time-travelling, paradoxical look at causality and paradoxes, Predestination is the next film from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spierig-Brothers/dp/B003H58886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spierig Brothers</a>, two batty German geeks who might just end up taking a shot at sci-fi royalty (or at the very least, sci-fi nobility) if things keep going the way they are. The film stars&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ethan-Hawke/dp/B000I8G5B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ethan Hawke</a>&nbsp;as a mysterious character known only as The Bartender, a genial man hiding dark secrets, who also happens to be a Temporal Agent. Yeah, that's a time traveller, for those of us who don't speak nerd. Aussie newcomer Sarah Snook stars as The Unmarried Mother, a world-weary man (You read that right. And believe it or not, that is the LEAST strange thing you will find in this movie) with hurt in his past. The plot jumps backwards and forwards from its heart in the early 1970's, through flashbacks, flashforwards, and a whole lot of time-travelling. Without giving much away, it revolves around the hunt for the Fizzle Bomber, a ruthless and unpredictable terrorist whose next attack will make 9/11 look like a playground scrap.

The film starts on a snappy pace, and never lets up. This ain't a movie for the casual viewer. This is a marathon for your brain - its ruthless and hard to follow, and you'll emerge dripping with sweat and beaming with pride. Predestination isn't confusing, but it is hard to understand. Time travel, paradoxes, time-loops, alternate realities, and causality are words that make all but the staunchest sci-fi fans quiver (if I told you I understood it 100%, I'd be lying). When you throw in sex changes, facial reconstructions, and more than a twinge of uncomfortable...um, personal...relationships (you'll see what I mean), you have a mature and thoroughly different science fiction. But what takes Predestination from a neat story with a cool script, to being genuinely compelling story-telling, is the acting.

Let's talk about the cast. I've always liked Ethan Hawke. His performances have no guile or artificiality to them; he throws himself into every character with gusto and skill (kind of like a less hammy, more choosy Nic Cage). But this was the first time when I sat up and said, ""Woah. This dude has got ACTING chops."" Chops that stand up there with the greats, in what might be his best performance in years. But Hawke's fine chops aren't even the highpoint of the film. Neither is the subtle, scheming and unforgettable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah-Taylor/dp/B00K7WU85I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah Taylor</a>&nbsp;as head of the CIA's time travel agency. The highpoint of the movie is a left-field punch to the gut called Sarah Snook. Remember (and chortle at) this name, because this girl is going places. Playing the tricky character of both a woman AND a man, both with electrifying aplomb and finely-honed skill, this is Snook's film to carry, and carry it she does.

Adding to the incredible script and acting is some classy, almost retro cinematography and a damn good score, making Predestination a brain-warping and unforgettable experience for the true science fiction fan. Casual viewers may be put off by the strange themes, uncomfortable insinuations, and cortex-crunching paradoxes of the movie. But for thinking fans of science fiction, psychological thrillers, or just good ol'fashioned thrilling and smart cinema, Predestination will deliver a kick in the pants that will be sure to have you thinking and massaging your aching cranium for days. This movie is NOT to be missed. As for my rating, ever since I saw it, I knew it was predestined to get 5 stars (see what I did there, eh?).

It was made and released in Australia, and never was in theaters in the US, so that's why I didn't hear about it until recently. I was reading an online list of thought-provoking movies, and it was on the list. And it is indeed thought provoking.

It's based on a Robert Heinlein story that I read long, long ago called All You Zombies. That story was actually one of the earliest time travel stories that follows time loops as part of the plot. That's old hat now, of course (see Time Traveler's Wife, for example), but it's still very well done in this movie.

Ethan Hawk is good, but I have to say that Sarah Snook is just outstanding. This would have been Academy Award material if the movie was mainstream in the US.

Watch it when you are ready to see something deep and detailed. If you are a Robert Heinlein fan, look for the homage to him (his books lying around for example).",1518739200,5,974,4.306010928961749

This film is worthy of the best of the classic scifi stories of that era. It has interesting characters, mystery, an inside of the mind story that transcends the time=travel device. Thoroughly enjoyable. Some might find the first half too slow where the 2 main characters sit and talk for a long time. But it is light a great piece of music, like Bolero, the repeating theme just grows organically and resonantes throught out the slow and inevitable progression as the viewer begins to grasp the paradox, the irony and the tragedy of the story.

6864318,4,B00Q8KCS60,I enjoyed the movie so I'm going to give it 4 stars in spite of its many flaws. It is kind of a basic time travel movie that also has an interesting sidebar to it it turns out to be most of the movie. If you're paying attention you'll probably figure out most of it long before the end but it still turns out to be pretty good. It's more or less based on Robert Heinlein story and I suspect that people that like the story probably won't like the movie because that usually works out that way. Enjoy it as a movie and don't try to compare it to the story cuz usually the stories are much better than the movies or the stories only have a vague similarity to the movie,1512864000,,667,4.022556390977444

This is definitely the best time travel movie I've ever seen.  Ethan Hawke's performance was excellent.  The beginning (pre credits) portion of the movie sets an intriguing premise, the movie then goes in an altogether unexpected direction for almost half of the story and then loops back onto itself like a ""snake eating it's own tail.""

Not as good as the original 12 Monkeys *, but definitely 2nd or 3rd. Time travel movies are hard to pull off, this one does.

1.) I didn't follow or see explanation as to how [SPOILER ALERT]... how the two main characters' nemeses /  arch villains were themselves, though their bosses didn't know this, & WHY did the protagonists not RETAIN this gained wisdom if they'd been repeatedly going back in time and learning who they really were?

6864408,3,B00Q8KCS60,"I'm at odds with this movie. On the one hand, Predestination does some pretty interesting and creative things with its plot, and its 90-minute run time doesn't leave a lot of opportunity for boredom. However, the direction of the film is so heavy-handed, that, so long as you're paying attention, you will figure out the twist pretty early on in the film. And that is unfortunate, because, I believe that if certain changes in the writing and the visuals of the film were altered, we could have a true sci-fi classic on our hands.

Still, Predestination is not exactly a bad movie, and I am not upset that I watched it, it is just always unfortunate when you can see how a few minor changes could have turned something average into something great.",1511222400,,748,4.62406015037594

As things started to move faster I actually paused the movie a couple of times just to go over things in my head to be sure I had it all straight.  By the end of the movie I was thinking I could spend a month going over all the possibilities and ramifications.  I love a good psychological thriller and this certainly was one.

The concept is eyebrow raising and of course the acting is pretty fair, considering there really aren't a lot of opportunities for it to be great due to the limitations of the concept. It's not meant to be movie of the year though, it's just an enigmatic theoretical conundrum of an exercise. I would have rated it higher if there had been any sort of explanation in place for how Jane came to be from the beginning. Somebody, somewhere, had to have existed that donated DNA to this existence or else this looped identity could have never begun in the first place. Since Jane and John are the same person and there is no point in it's timeline where there was any other actual person that created Jane, it is as the story says, a tail eating snake without end except that in order for the snake to eat it's own tail their must first BE a snake.

Well this movie involves temporal paradox, which can truly give one a mental cramp if they fail to follow or understand what that can mean for the plot and its antagonists/protagonists.
If you enjoyed The Usual Suspects or Inception, you would easily enjoy this movie as well, for its ability to twist possibilities on  their proverbial heads and shock you with reveal after reveal.

The purpose of this movie is to warp clear-mindedness into progressive thinking.

What's next:
Marriage to self?
More than two people in a single marriage?
Marriage to animals?
Marriage to an idea?
Marriage to the dead?

In right vs wrong, when you deny ultimate right, there can't be any wrong.  Logically there must be an ultimate standard; something outside ourselves.

Ethan Hawke is one of my fav actors and he comes through in this movie. Plot: a woman, the ""Unmarried Woman"", played by Sarah Snook, was left at an orphanage as a baby grew up feeling peculiar all her life. She was bullied as a child and lived the life of a very smart loner. She was eventually selected to a space program because of her uniqueness only to be rejected when she got into a fight with a classmate. She meets someone (wait for it!), becomes pregnant, and learns a fascinating thing about herself.after she gives birth to the child who was taken. An unusual and unexpectant twist happens when she meets Ethan Hawke's character, the Time Travel Agent who's connected to the woman's destiny. Here, the time travel journey begins. The movie got a bit confusing near the end and I had to cheat & go to wikepedia.com for an understanding/confirmation of what was happening near the end. Glad I did! Overall, this is a good movie.

This movie is so hard to follow and so complicated a plot that it's not really that fun to watch.  On top of that you get a force fed helping of the LGBT movement and we might as well throw in an F.. word since we got near the end and didn't have one, completely unnecessary.  The only good part of this movie, is in the end his future self kills his past self, or maybe it was the other way around, who could tell it was too bizarre.

Yeah, this movie is the essence of the phrase 'Art imitates Life'

For the first 60 minutes the plot seems to takes a back seat while the director's agenda drives drunk, but it does end up coming full circle in a very Oedipus/Futurama sort of way. Stick with it.

I'd rather see a film attempt this and fail than just go for the blockbuster time travel tropes - Terminators I am looking at you.

This is a chicken or the egg cerebral movie that requires you to pay attention in order to not be utterly confused at the end. It's somewhat low budget and has a very weak backstory.

I mean seriously: you can not be your own mother, father and baby. Just saying this statement has me laughing.

6864569,4,B00Q8KCS60,"This movie is complex and requires a bit of thinking.  If you are not interested in thinking about the complexity of a story, don't bother watching this film.  It's sort of like a mystery movie that you want to solve while watching, except they give you the answers, but you have to figure out what the answers mean at the end.  Ethan Hawke is a great performer as always and he seems to like doing complex sci-fi movies.  In this one, he is a secret government agent who travels through time and his task is to track down a criminal who bombs the subway system in New York City in 1974.  It seems he has done this before and failed and he's trying again.

6864577,1,B00Q8KCS60,"There is no amount of quality film technology or acting ability in Ethan Hawke's mind that can make this plot anything more than completely absurd. It was telegraphed from the beginning. From the actress trying so hard (and failing) to act butch in the exhausting and uninteresting bar scene, to the line about being a ""progressive"" organization, this movie is so obviously LBGT propaganda. It's so forced and obvious, there can be no suspension of disbelief. The plot is obvious and predictable, especially once you catch on to the fact it is LBGT propaganda. This movie serves only one purpose: propaganda. It is a pathetic display of how obviously mentally incoherent and removed from reality that a person must be to even begin to accept what this movie offers as plausible.

Spoiler: It's about a hermaphrodite that time travels, has sex with a younger version of itself, impregnates that younger version of itself, gives birth to itself, and eventually kills an older version of itself after the movie reveals the hermaphrodite IS the bomber that it has been searching for all movie long. I knew from the first scene that Ethan Hawke was chasing himself and very quickly realized this would be a trans/hermaphrodite, narcissistic love story of the weirdest order a couple of minutes into the bar scene.

If you enjoy plots that are plausible and aren't beating you over the head with propaganda, stay away from this movie.",1509667200,6,1428,4.945833333333334

6864631,4,B00Q8KCS60,"I like good Sci-Fi flicks.  Ive not been much of a reader in the category however so, I was unfamiliar with Heinlein,  I get hes one of the fathers of the genre to many.  This means often hes considered along side some of his contemporaries who became known better (i.e iconic in this cases) than he, that would Asimov and Clarke.  That said what I was able to read about Heinlein seemed promising so I thought its Ethan Hawke and mostly hes enjoyable to watch and when hes not it usually doesnt take longer than 10 in and Im done.  So, Predestination got the nod for a look-see.

Predestination has theme of time travel and a sub-text of how it could relate to keeping catastrophic events that happened from ever doing so.  Perhaps it has a whole other question of what a person would do given the chance to alter outcomes?

I guess time travel will always be of fantastical interest as in what if?.  But, terrorism and serial killing in a story from 1958thats impressive as now we are aware of a much different world. This would be shocking in the time it was written and sadly not so much when this film was made.  Sometimes Sci-Fi incorporates things which seem far-fetched only to later become more relevant as if the writer saw the future.  This quality is always impressive in retrospect.  In as many ways the story has little relevance to the terrorism abatement as we know it (i.e. we cant travel back to alter time) but, it is somewhat amazing that in 58 that element was used, and in NYC as a key part of the story, which is definitely mind-bending.  In the end its pure entertainment and because it gets complicated with human emotions and smart slow reveals (as to who the travelers are) it holds your attention.  The ending will be brilliant to some and frustrating to as many but, its the ride in between that pulls the Sci-Fi fan in.  In that regard it is quite an original and good flick.",1509235200,2,1905,4.449567723342939

6864634,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Once in awhile someone comes along with a great retelling of a favorite story. This is one of those.

I caught this film on Prime and watched idly, with no knowledge or preconceptions. Ten minutes into it, a key line clicks: ""When I was a little girl ..."" And bam! You know instantly that you're watching Heinlein's tale. I read ""All You Zombies"" just a few years after Heinlein wrote it. It's one of those shorts that's in every Best Of collection from that era, or should be. Wikipedia says it was written in a single day. But that twisted tale of before's and after's is one that sticks precisely because it twists the mind around it so.

And, instantly curious, I watched the story develop on the screen. Jane's story is thoughtfully played by Sarah Snook; her love and downfall intensify a hundredfold when we revisit it. Ethan Hawke - who I admit to rarely watching - carried his part perfectly through every momentous decision that affects his character's fate. It's doubtful that Heinlein intended the subtlety that comes through in the screenplay, even in its simplicity.

Regrettably, too many in the present are jaded by too many poorly conceived time-travel conundrums. But to a kid who still lives in the 60's, this movie was as refreshing and full of wonderment as the day I first read it.",1509235200,,1303,4.681222707423581

It is a typical cause-effect-cause inversion loop, raised a few levels and loops.  There are no branching timelines or alternate realities.  There is no ""time paradox,"" unless you count its inception, which I still haven't figured out solidly.  Its well-acted and skillfully laid out so that many of the bigger, more radical plot jumps are easier to buy into.  There's a central gender twist that many of the negative reviews are hung up on ... but those reviews don't even cite the correct gender issue, as if it were a modern psychological political progressivist political gender issue, even tho' this gender issue is physical was dealt with exactly as it would have been back then (and often today). Still, it's a contrivance that's essential to the plot, but revealed carefully and orderly so you can focus on the characters and how things play out (unless you're hyper-sensitive about normalcy).  If you're attentive, as you figure out the first few twists, you'll find the later twists easy to predict.  But I still haven't figured out two points: 1. The prime mover of the cycle of events  2. the motive for the agency causing what they cause  3. how the agency first caused what they cause.  (Okay, that's three, but they overlap.)  There's a song they play in the background to bludgeon you with the obviousness of the reveal, which is just annoyingly stupid.",1509235200,2,1536,4.846743295019157

6864679,3,B00Q8KCS60,"Heinlein was the greatest sci fi writer of all time. I read practically everything he wrote, but as he advanced in years his writing got strange (not by today's standards). Stranger in a Strange Land was his masterpiece, but it was also very unlike his earlier work, which was more like Starship Troopers. I enjoyed his earlier work, which was fun to read and didn't require deep contemplation. This story I never read, but after watching it, can't place it on the same pedestal as Starship Troopers and certainly not even in the same solar system as Dune. It plays some interesting tricks with time and sex to lead you up to a surprise ending. One thing I found different was the movie follows the book so closely that they didn't change the dates to give it the foreboding element of something that is yet to come. Instead it uses the 70s and 80s with the same look they had, but with some things totally different, llike the ""Space Girls"" program. The story itself is weak, because Heinlein made the story specifically to provide all the factors needed to pull of the greatest time travel shocker of all time. After he delivers the shock, you take a minute to recover, then realize it was all contrived to deliver that ""GOTCHA!"" moment.",1508803200,,1239,4.610859728506787
6864680,5,B00Q8KCS60,"This story is fantastic.  The plot becomes a little predictable towards the end, but Ethan Hawke and everyone in this movie does a masterful acting job.  Its one you can't turn away from, captivating and compelling.  If you like SiFi the cinematic telling of Robert Heinlein's short story does the film maker's credit and just proves why Heinlein is my idol.  (I read his stuff in high school and college.

As if the confusing way they handle time travel isn't annoyance enough, it toys with the gut instincts to see and hear a female trying to pass as a man; it's disturbing because it  goes against our inborn inner sense of gender truth.

6864689,4,B00Q8KCS60,"I don't know how the director got such good performances out of the actors because the central concept is flawed--but the acting was in the pocket, as we say in music.  You could be born a female, sexually mature, then ultimately have sex change surgery (reassignment or whatever they call it) and then go back in time and impregnate yourself.  I'm not a biologist but I suppose the zygote would be viable--if there was a zygote.  But at that point, there is no denying that there are two distinct idividuals.  The child, even if swiped from the orphanage, would not grow into your original female self.  so that's just wrong.  But until you figure that out, the movie feels really legitimate.  Have to give credit for the surpise when we learn who Jane meets (the Lincoln quote scene).  I thought it was going to be Ethan Hawke barkeep but it's Snook John.  And the details of the encounter were all really good.

 The other major plot point is how the bartender turns out to be the fizzle bomber.  The agency has information about the bomber, what he does after the attack, and the barkeep (probably breaking protocol since he's retired but his time travel device did not successfully break itself) travels in time and then in space to a laundromat to confront him.  The bomber claims his attacks saved lives, but the barkeep thinks they cost more lives than were saved.  This is one of the focal points of the predestination theme...the barkeep can't cope with the idea that he will ultimately become the fizzle bomber and he shoots his older self to death.  This a minute after the bomber has told him that killing him would ensure his destiny to become the bomber himself (and that the agency guy set it all up).  The only way to break the chain the bomber claims is for the barkeep to love the bomber, his older self (and not kill him).  It is quite possibly a homosexual come on (given what's already transpired), as the bomber tells him how unsatisfying his recent female crush will turn out to be.  But that's not really the point.  Several times the characters (who are all the same person) talk about loving each other.  So that reduces to loving one's self.  So to make a jump here, the oldest barkeep (the bomber) is saying that loving himself is the only way not to become the bomber.  that sounds right.",1508716800,,2318,4.561743341404358

Spoiler Alert: here comes the preposterous plot. I'm always willing to suspend my disbelief, to a certain point, but some things just go too far. Hawke's character is a member of an elite Government group who travel through time to stop crimes before they are committed. Try and follow this. Spoiler alert! Hawke meets and impregnates himself before he became a man; that's right, his younger self is a woman, who, after giving birth (to herself) has to have a sex change operation. Yes, I said, she gives birth to herself. After the baby is born, Hawke steals the baby from the hospital, travels back in time and places the infant at the doorstep of an orphanage where she (Hawke as a girl) is raised. So, to reiterate: Hawke has sex with himself, gives birth to himself (as a girl). It gets worse (yeah, hard to imagine). The bomber Hawke is tracking throughout the film, turns out to be himself, who he kills at the end. I watched this film because it got good reviews.

Growing up in a tiny town full of religulous influence, I was insulated from the history of the times he wrote in. Like Asimov, he came off as difficult to interpret and odd. Scifi and fantasy writers of the time can be predictably cordoned off into two camps: those who were writing to sell books to the mindless masses who preferred to stay in their worlds of shuttle launches and propaganda, and those who saw the advances in science and human capacity for empathy, waning, if not full-on limited by human nature. Heinlein is like many authors of the time, who work better in the imagination. His fixation on sexuality, clones, self-gratification, and how those things can still ultimately benefit humanity can be off-putting, but still speak volumes. I don't remember this particular story, but it was true to his spirit. If only Western bubbleheads had chosen Heinlein instead of Hubbard to make a cult figure of, perhaps the struggles of centuries would've been resolved by now.

Detached from my own partially preconceived opinion, this is a well done movie I hadn't heard of, and Hawk surpassed my very low expectations of him. The female lead is amazing, not to tout my own bias toward reds, being one, but she's on par with Tilda Swinton and Gillian Anderson (who may not actually be redheads, but w/e).

1st, the people who dislike it have issue with the part of the plot that is exposed just after the midpoint.

This is NOT an LGBT movie, as some ""Christians"" have claimed. This is the PERFECT example, AND answer, to the grandfather paradox. I wonder if any scientists have ever watched this and thought ""Well hell, that makes sense, resolves conflicts and creates a stable timeline, without all of the mental wheel spinning""

Hawke did a great job as did Snook. I would recommend this to most Sci-Fi fans, albeit those without the mental capacity to think beyond sexuality, will be turned off of the movie as a whole.

Had they not made it a cliffhanger in the final 2 minutes, in the manner they did, it would have been 5 stars. I despise an open-ended ""ending"". To me it smacks of either a hopeful sequel bid, or the inability to resolve the final thread",1507766400,6,891,4.6923076923076925

DO NOT buy into this dribble-esque Garbage for one single second.

This movie is an LGBT propaganda piece, designed to confuse people about gender.
It has been cloaked with a sci-fi theme, but the entire first half of the film attempts to build a very large story up around a woman who wants to pretend to be a man.

They use Time Travel to have her go back in time, and impregnate herself, which creates a massive identity crisis for her, across multiple entities in time :/
It's the story of a woman who becomes very confused, and corrupt, and ends up killing herself.

And just throwing the chicken-an-egg conundrum out there does not placate me, nor does it make this movie deep or philosophical.

Let me sum this movie up: some douche discovers time travel is possible within a limited range of time (like 40 years around 1970 or something random). Government creates a department to muck around with history and prevent certain crimes from taking place. Some amoral government workers leave a baby girl with with ambiguous genitalia at an orphanage in he 1950s. Baby is raised as a she, grows up to be super smart, but with a chip on her shoulder, no self-esteem, and a sense mental superiority. She unknowingly sleeps with her future self, which is now a man because a doctor discovered her ambiguity and ""fixed"" her by performing gender reassignment surgery without her permission. Wait there is more. The surgery is performed while she is unconscious after giving birth to the baby that she made with her future male self, after he went back in time to try and stop her from falling in love with her baby-daddy. Yes, him or herself, but he didn't know it. When he realizes, he sleeps with her (himself) anyway (yep), thus repeating or creating the pattern. Also, the baby is stolen from the hospital nursery room man by another strange man who turns out to be her more distant future self after reconstructive facial surgery due to burns he incurred while fighting his still more distant future self, who is also a terrorist/time traveling agent working off book. Of course, the stolen baby is taken back to the 1950s and dropped off at the orphanage, thereby creating the cycle. Give me a break.",1507248000,12,1980,4.641025641025641

All the same, I will say that this is one of the better mind-bending movies I have seen from this decade.  Besides the fact that it also stars Ethan Hawke, this movie reminded me a lot of Gattaca in its alternate 20th century aesthetic and for how it makes the most of its small budget.  While it is not the first movie to explore the consequences of altering the timeline, it does so in a way that is clever and that relies more on quality writing and acting than special effects.",1497312000,,667,4.277777777777778
6864807,3,B00Q8KCS60,"3.75/5  As with all time travel stories its easy to pick holes in the plot of PREDESTINATION, and because the film endeavours to circumvent the usual pitfalls its even more open to such nitpicking. But the Spierig Brotherss script and direction are assured enough to make such matters seem unimportant when considering what is an intriguing and, for the most part, gripping film. And besides, its great fun to watch the film as it disappears up its own derrire. The performances are good, and Snooks in particular helps to imbue the film with a surprisingly strong emotional charge. Although the ending is no great surprise it is still quite a satisfying denouement to a very enjoyable film. Of course, you can never explain away a paradox because if you can there cant have been a paradox in the first place. So just sit back, enjoy the ride, and take it all in your stride.",1496966400,,875,4.681818181818182

6864809,5,B00Q8KCS60,"I've often expressed my admiration of Robert A. Heinlein. I've read just about everything by him I could get my hands on, including the short story ""All You Zombies,"" upon which this movie is based. No--it's not a movie about zombies. That's a phrase used by The Bartender in the movie.

The last two movies made based on Heinlein books were huge disappointments. Major point plots were missing. The director and producer of STARSHIP TROOPERS were so far off the mark, I'm sure The Old Man would have asked them to take his name off the title. Later, while looking up something else, I learned the director gave the book to an assistant to read because he found the first two paragraphs ""boring,"" but was determined to do the project anyway, because he knew it was about humans at war with giant bugs.

After that travesty, why would I buy a movie based on a Heinlein book in which the producer and director changed the title? I'm in Mensa. Yeah--the genius club. A member of our sci-fi special interest group recommended it. The guys who did this movie are avid Heinlein fans. I would imagine they changed the name so people wouldn't flock to the theaters expecting to see dead people walking around eating live people's brains. Because again--there are no zombies in this movie.

PREDESTINATION is the story of a true-confession writer who calls himself ""The Unwed Mother."" He walks into a bar... And has a long conversation with The Bar Tender. In a book, we'd call that an info-dump, and I'd slash it to bits. But, they don't just sit there and talk. We follow the man's story through flashback, and it's a doosey.

PREDESTINATION is a movie for grown-ups. It has some action and some violence. But mostly, it'll make ""All You Zombies"" think.",1494892800,2,1746,4.677524429967427
6864810,2,B00Q8KCS60,"Re-make, please! Great story, decent actors, terrible directorial decision. The painfully long, misguided inclusion in the movie of the ""story in the bar,"" that some other reviewers mentioned, ruined the movie for me. About 1/2 the movie just shows the plot and story and gets on with it; the deadly other half is a person narrating the story and it's just intolerably dull. It didn't have to be. If the director had just elected to show instead of tell the entire time, the idea is extremely interesting.",1494633600,5,505,4.816091954022989

You may piece some things together vaguely, but probably not to the extent that they really unfold here. And just because you suspected something doesn't make it any less mind-blowing, because you'll find out it was more complex than you thought it was. There are clues dropped here and there through signs, songs, etc., if you've got skills. It's definitely one to watch again--at least the second half. Highly recommended to fans of time travel and anyone with life regrets or wondering why their life is crappy and lacking in purpose.",1493683200,,877,4.4875

6864816,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Predestination is a superb sci-fi film with highly unusual twists. It is based on a short story by Robert Heinlein called ""All You Zombies."" The film follows the story perfectly but changes the last third. Predestination is a doctrine held by some Christians who read it into Bible events even though others do not see the idea in these texts. It is the idea that people do not have control over their lives, at least not entirely. They are puppets in God's hands. God, for unknown reasons, determines how people will act. God is not involved in the film and is not mentioned by Heinlein.
In fact, the story is not about predestination but about a strange use of a time machine. The key to the tale in both the short story and film is a song played a couple of times in the bar where parts of the story occurs, I am my own grandpa, and is symbolized by the ring that the barkeep wears which shows a snake biting its own tale. The story is opaque but becomes clear in the final page of the book and final scene of the film when we see that the barkeep, although a man, had gone through a cesarean operation. We then understand  what I will not reveal completely, not wanting to be a spoiler  that he has an unusual time-travel mission for which he had to jump back and forth from 1970 to 1992 to 1963 to 1964 to 1945 to 1992 to accomplish his last mission.
The story is mind-boggling, unusual, thought provoking. It is a tale by one of the best sci-fi writers.
In short, without revealing much, a barkeep meets a man in the bar who he needs to recruit to become a time traveler to stop harmful events from occurring. The man turns out to have been born with both male and female organs. She tells the barkeep her story. She met a man, had sex with him, became pregnant, needed a caesarian operation, the doctors discovered she had male and female organs, they removed the female organs, and she became a man. She gave birth to a boy who was stolen at the hospital, and she never found her boy. The barkeep offers her a chance  or so he says  to kill the man who made her pregnant. If she agrees, she then needs to take on a certain job. She agrees.",1493251200,,2147,4.267813267813268

6864818,3,B00Q8KCS60,"Trailer is relatively misleading. If you're expecting an action film with a ""good vs. evil"" time-cop story, this isn't what you'll get. More a story of pursuit of self vs. pursuit of bad guy... the time travel layer adds complexity and depth, and certainly provides a psychological maze for those so inclined to attempt to find a beginning and end. Performances were solid, even excellent, but foreshadowing clumsy in spots, and the storytelling grew long in some areas.",1492905600,,470,5.038461538461538

 From the beginning your head will spin. Its like a puzzle.
 A woman (Noah Taylor)will approach to a man (Ethan Hawke) and tells a story.
 They seems like meeting for the first time. A guy is a bartender and the woman (man) is just a typical guy who just want to have a drink. He(she) tells his story.
 But this is all designed.
 You will have to concentrate really well because you will go to wonderland together.
 Will this be a difficult movie? No.
 It will be all kindly explained and after all explanation, you will shout, WOW, what a great Sci-fi movie I just saw!!
 I really don't want to spoil at all but I have to a little.
 There is this woman/man. Who was born with both genitals mans / womans.
 He becomes a target to this agent Ethan Hawke, a time traveler secret agent.
 He mixed her life.
 Because of him, she changes her sex. Falls in love with herself. That was possible because she time travels too. They even have babies together. She and herself after she changes sex. And the baby? The baby is herself!!!!!
 Wait there is more.
 The agents final mission is to find the utmost killer and after one failure to kill him, he finally meets the killer and shoots him. And you know what who the killer is?
 I won't tell.
 You will freeze, stunned, speechless by each moments.
 This is script of all script.
 This is not a flamboyant billion dollar special effect Sci-fi film.
 This movie matches with ideas and ideas only.
 There is not much action scenes either.
 Its all about surprising ideas that make you not able to shut up at all.
 Noah Taylor won a lot of best actress award from a lot of film festivals.
 She was really something from this movie. She was even better than BOYS DONT CRY or any other movies related to this matter.
 The cinematography was excellent and the lighting was very dark and detailed.
 The music is very heavy but well matched with each moments.
 You should watch the movie at least twice like most of the well made movies.
 I am attaching the movie for free and please if you have enough luxury please watch it with bluray later. The attached movie has less detail so.

Where to buy : bluray is 16$ and dvd is 6.72$ bluray is worth buying all the way.

I loved Ethan Hawke and I loved the simple yet effective special effect used to actually ""time travel"" however...SPOILER ALERT...whenever - in a Time Travel flick - a character's face is not fully shown - i.e. they're hooded or masked or have a hat drawn low and they're executing some intense act like murder or violence, then that's a TIP OFF that they are in fact the time traveller coming back to repair or prevent some future event. There were several instances of that device here. The film was an overall letdown to me because it's Plot Twists left me feeling manipulated as a viewer. That said, the acting, dialogue and methodology of the film's time travel techniques were excellent and the cinematography was top notch. It's a fun film by itself but honestly - unless you're new to the Time Travel genre - it's not as ""mind-bending"" or as great as some of the reviews here on Amazon that led me to purchase the bluray.",1473379200,,988,4.5875706214689265

Nor does it ever explain why its premise unfolds as it does except for repeated and lazy appeals to ""inevitability.""

I liked the ending being open ended; does he become the fizzle bomber or does he live the rest of his life as a normal person? My take is he does become the fizzle bomber to complete the ""circle of causality"" required for his existence. This is one time travel movie that does not have paradox and plot problems that most time travel movies seem to ignore. My friends complained that the plot was slow to develop and did not hold their interest, but my argument to them was every scene built on the preceding scenes to make the story complete and logical.
The only flaw is how the circle of events got started in the first place...... draw a circle and once completed, where does it start and where does it end?",1467158400,,969,4.388888888888889

""To save his future, he must protect his past"" - Predestination poster tag line

Four MIND-BENDING Stars. Starring Ethan Hawke as ""The Agent"", the time-travel movie ""Predestination"" has a serpentine plot that may keep the audience guessing to the end. In the beginning, ""The Agent"" escapes a near fatal run-in with a mad bomber, then he gets his ""final mission"" as a time-traveling cop to catch the bomber. But then movies goes to a barroom set piece and spends almost 50 puzzling minutes dealing exclusively with the Sarah Snook ""Unmarried Mother"" character, cutting to some other interspersed scenes, and she puts on quite an acting show once it is realized she's playing two very different roles. But persevere, because they are setting the stage for the middle and the ending. And just when the movie appears to finally tie up all loose ends, they throw yet another curve ball, enjoyably violating many time travel 'laws'. And  just how many of the story characters are predestined? Stay tuned and you may go immediately to watch it again to find the clues. Starring Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Christopher Kirby, Christopher Sommers, Kuni Hashimoto, and Noah Taylor. Based on Robert A. Heinlein's short story ""All You Zombies"".

6864975,5,B00Q8KCS60,"I watched this based on the good overall rating and Ethan Hawke. As excellent as he is, Sarah Snook stole the show. I found this to be a fantastic brain teaser, one that leaves you basking in the afterglow well after it's over (and by ""afterglow"" I really mean furious flurries of deliciously confusing thoughts). The movie moves along from start to finish, doing a good job maintaining an atmosphere of intrigue and tension, and accelerates as it enters its final lap. The emotional journey gave me similar feelings of wonderment as when I watched The Prestige, Usual Suspects, Project Almanac, and Coherence. If you liked those films, I think you'll like this one too!

A forewarning: The film focuses on the storytelling above the science/technology. If you find scientific inaccuracies very annoying, there are a couple that will likely prevent you from fully enjoying this movie.",1463875200,2,884,5.01360544217687

6865001,1,B00Q8KCS60,"Yawn. Time travel is a paradox. Yawn. Didn't we already know that? This movie proves time travel is impossible and contradicts reality, even if you believe in aliens, ESP, mystic powers, and God; time travel will never happen  How many time travel movies do we need?  If you traveled in time to your future self, your future self would remember you doing that, because your time traveler self is younger, and he is older, so as you act anything out, he remembers every act.  So the future self could advise the younger self bad thing to avoid. The younger self listens, then the older self instantly changes because his whole past was changed by the younger self changing his actions. So then the older self doesn't need to advise avoiding anything.  But then again, bad things probably still happened (which is probably the point of this movie to point out) even though he changed his actions.  But the thing is, would the old self remember having told his young self to change things, because if his younger self changed things, his whole life would be different, and the older self would have no need to advise his younger self against certain actions. So did the first advice of the old self to the younger self ever happen?  This is one example of the problem, I'm not even mentioning all the other chain reactions you trigger that change the future. It just gets ridiculous. And if you're over a certain age you have likely considered the ramifications of time travel by watching various movies over the years and its just kind of boring at this point.",1461196800,6,1558,4.647272727272727

But then, as it turns out, you needed it all to ""understand"" the somewhat convoluted plot.  So hang in there for that part.  If you totally get this movie the first time through, then you've probably got some ribbons from academic decathlons in boxes from your college days stashed somewhere.

All I can say is be prepared to give the movie plenty of ""artistic license""...which means, allowing it to state that something is possible in the world it has imagined which would probably be totally impossible and absolutely preposterous in real life.  Science fiction movies often require a person to give some artistic license, BUT this one really makes a huge charge on that tab.

It's 1970's Manhattan and we meet two individuals in bar...  a bartender (Ethan Hawke) and the androgynous individual (Sarah Snook) who writes magazine stories under the byline ""The Unmarried Mother."" A bet is soon made over a bottle of liquor that the bartender is about to hear the best story ever.  This leads us into a whole backstory on the writer.  This involves frank gender issues so if that is gonna get in the way of enjoying a fascinating sci-fi flick with some very twisty narrative structure... don't watch this (so disappointing to see some reviewers hating on this for that reason).  I felt the story was riveting and Sarah Snook did an amazing job in her role.

Ethan Hawke's character has a few surprises of his own to offer and soon enough we find their lives entwined in some rather bizarre time traveling events.  It made me think of Gattaca in that it's a captivating character study and quite psychological... less emphasis on the action and such.  But it's not just a character study, there's a government agency and the Temporal Agents they recruit with a mission to stop future crimes before they can happen. There's a lot going on here and you won't see these twists coming.  This is the kind of movie you'll want to watch more than once to catch everything going down.  It's kind of confusing at first.

Definitely one of my new favorite sci-fi movies.  It's based on Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 short story, ""All You Zombies.""",1453420800,,1463,4.694117647058824

It's hard to give away too much without spoiling the entire movie; therefore, suffice it to say that there were a couple of things that bother me when it comes to movies and acting.  When trying to pass off a woman as a man, for the love of god, give the actor a better haircut.  Also, the voice is a dead giveaway.

It warns you as it goes along and drops hints of the yet unrevealed and mind bending place it is going.  The fizzle bomber must be stopped before it happens.

One of the two or three best time travel movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the most complex, satisfying, mind-blowing Rubik's Cube-like time travel paradoxes ever. I had to stop and just sit on my couch thinking for several minutes after the movie ended to get things straight in my mind.

There is a certain oddness to the first 30 minutes, but not odd in a bad way. It's just that it veers from it's scifi opening and shifts to being a very compelling drama for a time. Suspense builds throughout even this segment of the movie if you stick with it, due to the superb script, dialogue, and acting.

I don't know of any bartendar that would have the time and freedom in a NY pub to listen to this man/womans story as they relax in a secluded booth, unless the bar is self serve, which I don't think it is.

It clearly demonstrates extensive special effects aren't necessary for exceptional science fiction.  It is a mind bender, not a shoot-em-up, so if that's not your thing, it may be better to leave it alone.  On the most basic level, the plot is about an agency's attempt to prevent a bombing.  But it's really about two desperate people that fall in love, except they are actually the same person.  It does have an R rating, but other than the occasional profanity and a male nude that wouldn't offend a nun, it's pretty mild.

The disk DOES contain special features; in the film making documentary, in ""week six"" Sarah Snook gives away what the film is about and what drives it emotionally.

6865150,1,B00Q8KCS60,"Just finished watching ""Predestination"" released by Stage 6 Films.
When ""Predestination"" was first released, it was hailed as an outstanding film adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's classic time travel short story ""All You Zombies"" - which sadly I never read. I have read most of what is called Heinlein's classic juvenile science fiction novels and enjoyed them years ago - okay, many many years ago.
So I was intrigued by the idea of a modern attempt at a movie of a Heinlein story.  I should have just stayed intrigued and waited until this kerstinker of movie was in the $5 at the nearby Wal-Mart.
""Predestination"" tells  a simple tale that is quite well known to movie viewers - a Temporal Agent is investigating and trying to prevent attacks in the past by the ""Fizzle Bomber.""  His last attempt ends in failure when he's not able to seal the breach in the bomb containment box in time and is badly burned.
Now since he has just about reached the limit of time jumps he can make before temporal psychosis overwhelms him, he must jump back in time to recruit his younger self into the  unnamed Temporal Agency - at least unnamed in this movie.
What follows next is one of the oddest and longest pick up conversations in a bar that I have ever had the unfortunate experience to witnesses both auditory and visually.
Make NO mistake, ""Predestination"" is that most dreadful of movies, a self-absorbed and pretentious science fiction art film.
How pretentious?  SPOILER ALERT:  You will hear the song, ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" several times throughout the movie; along with seeing full frontal nudity from a side angle and see that ultimate of all time travel paradoxes - a take on self-love; and I just know I'm going to get in trouble for this observation, but if David Gerrold got the idea for Star Trek's Tribbles from Heinlein's Martian fuzzy cats; then its easy to see how Gerrold got some of his ideas for ""The Man Who Folded Himself.""
NOT RECOMMENDED!

6865152,5,B00Q8KCS60,"This film is mind blowing. All Science Fiction lovers know that time is something nobody should mess with cause time paradoxes can and surely will be born due to small changes in the past. It is like the going back to the concept of ""Reality Changes"" that Isaac Asimov explores in his great novel entitled ""The End of Eternity"". But this movie is not based on an Asimov novel, but on a Robert A. Heinlein short story... ""All You Zombies"".

This movie is by far the most greatly achieved example of an ontological paradox, a causal loop, a paradox in time travel. The scrip was orchestrated perfectly and the performance of Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook will leave you speechless!!!

Predestination has gained by far a place among my favorite movies of all times. I have always loved Science Fiction and time travel implications, paradoxes and effects particularly. Try this excellent movie and you won't regret it. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing during the whole story.... Mind-bender indeed!!!

P.S. For a similar experience with some international touch and simpler production, try Spanish movie ""Time Crimes"" also here on Amazon:

6865183,3,B00Q8KCS60,"** SPOILERS ** Don't read further if you want to see this film. ** SPOILERS **

I'm not a big fan of temporal loop stories and here we have yet another one. A story that's relatively predictable (and far too slow paced) at that. While this story is based on a Heinlein novel, this movie is barely 'okay'. The fundamental and logical problem is that any temporal agency would have figured out the temporal dilemma that Jane/John Doe faces. Not only is this agent's moves incredibly one track focused (every move solely involves progressing Jane/John's own life at the expense of all else), the temporal agency would have eventually realized the uselessness of this agent and ended the temporal loop themselves. Letting this one loop fester over and over in time infinitely is just illogical. I mean, why would any agency spend a boatload of money on an agent that isn't producing? They wouldn't. This is the logic flaw to the entire story.

While I understand that it may sound good on paper, the story is mostly lame when put to film. If this were a TV series and every now and again this agent picked up the thread of his/her own life progression as part of performing normal unrelated duties as a temporal agent, I'd find that more believable. It seems that you might run into your past and future self occasionally while performing your normal temporal agent duties. But, when every single move you make locks you into nothing but progression of your own life, that's just too far fetched and contrived even for time travel stories.",1440460800,,1535,4.702602230483271
6865184,5,B00Q8KCS60,"First, let me say that I'm giving this a 5-star rating for its thought-provoking premise, not because it's equal to Lawrence of Arabia or Out of Africa or To Kill a Mockingbird.  This movie, if you stay with it till the end, will have you questioning everything you think is true about life and your journey through it.

Now, this is how I ended up watching Predestination with Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook.  Several months ago a friend of mine at work recommended that I watch the film.  She felt it might be right up my alley, and that I would understand what was happening.  She didn't.  I had recommended Cloud Atlas to her, and she hadn't liked that film, either.  Now, it was my turn with Predestination.  I purchased it from Amazon, and then it sat in my ""to-be-watched"" stack for a few months.  I finally pulled it out and watched the film on Sunday, wondering if I would enjoy it and how I would feel about its storyline afterwards.

I have to say this film turned out to be a wonderful surprise, and that it blew me right out of my white cotton bobby socks.  Don't ask me if I understood everything that was going on because I didn't, though in a way I think I did.  Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I have a distinct fascination with movies about Time Travel (The Time Traveler's Wife, The Lake House, Somewhere in Time, Looper with Joseph Gordon Levitt & Bruce Willis, The Terminator series, and the original version of The Time Machine with Rod Taylor, etc.) and thought there was a good chance I'd like this.

I did.

Ethan Hawke plays the Barkeeper, who's also a Temporal Agent.  He works for a government agency that's led by Noah Taylor's character and travels back in time to change the course of events and to prevent tragic deaths.  Hawke's character relentlessly attempts to prevent the Fizzle Bomber from achieving his massive destruction on a grand scale.  During one of his visits to a different time period, the Barkeeper meets the Unmarried Woman, who is played by Sarah Snook.  Sarah pretty much steals the movie with her unbelievable acting ability and how she portrays two of the main characters in the film.

You see, while sitting at the bar, conversing with Ethan, she's a man, but actually started off life as a female.

Confused?

Sarah's parents supposedly gave her up for adoption, leaving her in a box on the steps of the orphanage.  As she (Jane) grew into a young beautiful woman who was astounding in her intellect, she remained a loner, but also a scraper who was more than willing to defend herself against men and women in a fight.  One night she bumps into the man who is her soul mate, but mysteriously disappears from her life, leaving Jane abandoned and pregnant.  When surgery has to be done to save the baby, the doctors discover that Jane's a hermaphrodite and remove the female sexual organs from her body, turning her into a man for better or worse.

Of course, the Unmarried Woman blames her soul mate for her condition and what transpires, but everything is not what it seems.

The Barkeeper appears to be the only who knows what's really going on.

There is one scene in which Ethan Hawke is talking to Noah Taylor's character and mentions the serpent swallowing its tail.  This is symbol from ancient history, representing the duality of existence and eternity.  What is later discovered by the viewing audience will leave you breathless and thinking about the film for days.  Needless to say, life is a paradox and by changing one thing in the past, everything in the future can be affected.

This is the type of film that's difficult to understand and follow, but I guarantee there are huge rewards for those who are able to grasp its meaning.  Many will not like the movie, or understand it enough to give the film a chance.  Let me just say that both the late Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking believe in time travel and that's it's possible.  But, what would the results of time travel be if a person were to go back and change certain things?  How would the future be affected by this and what would be totally different about it?  I mean if Hitler had been assassinated during the thirties by someone from the future, few of the baby boomers would be here now.

I would not exist.

Maybe the assassin wouldn't exist, either.

Mind blowing, isn't it?

In the Behind-the-Scenes, the three major actors discuss why they took their roles in this amazing film.  It boils down to the fact that no one had an answer to the questions mentioned above.  This allowed each actor to have a certain amount of freedom in how they chose to portray their characters.

Of course, it was Sarah Snook who played both a woman and a man, which was challenging to say the least.  It was necessary for her to learn the mannerisms of being a man and how to speak and move like one.  She really should've been nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress for her performance.  This isn't to take away from Ethan Hawke's performance, or that of Noah Taylor.  It's just that Sarah Snook definitely shined in her role and made the viewer believe in her tale of woe.

Considering the budget for Predestination was a low one, everyone had to come up with ideas on how to achieve a certain effect or perform in a particular manner that would drive the storyline forward.  The cast and crew did a magnificent job in turning Robert Heinlein's short story into a serious thought-provoking film that clearly questions morality, time travel, love, and who we are as human beings, not to mention the journey each of us is on.

Filmed and scored to perfection, Predestination is a winner in my book.  This film was designed to make the audience think and to experience strong emotions for its main characters.  It definitely succeeded in this endeavor.  The whole film was balanced by the acting of Sarah Snook.  It was her job to make you believe in her character.  If that hadn't worked the movie would've been a failure.  As it was, she rose to the occasion and proved what a gifted performer she is at this stage of her career.

And let's not forget Ethan Hawke.  His performances are always impeccable and because of that, the other actors have to rise up to his level and often win Oscars for their excellent roles.

If you're a fan of films that deal with time travel and subjects that will trigger your mind into overtime, I recommend this movie for you.  The film also shows what can be done on a small budget by studios and that $200,000,000.00 tent-pole movies are not necessary in order to make something that's entertaining and will the engage the audience's mind.",1440374400,3,6611,4.580068143100511

6865204,4,B00Q8KCS60,"The track record for television and movie adaptations of the late Robert A. Heinlein's works is largely unblemished by success.

Consider the sappy ""Jerry Was a Man"" segment in the ""Masters of Science Fiction"" television series. Why anyone would pick that story, IMO one of Heinlein's weakest, to use for a television show is beyond me. ""The Puppet Masters"" movie was okay in places, but it lost its way partway through and did not in any way do justice to Heinlein's superb, grim and dark original novel. As for the truly execrable big-screen version of ""Starship Troopers""--well, the less said about that stinker, the better.

So I didn't have very high hopes for ""Predestination,"" based on Heinlein's 1959 short story ""--All You Zombies--""

But I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, if you held me up against a wall with a gun to my head, I'd be forced to admit that the film version of the short story is not bad at all. However, I confess that I re-read the story (for probably the dozenth time) immediately before watching the movie, so the plot was fresh in my mind and I understood what was going on in the movie, which may not have been the case if I'd gone into it cold. Much of the movie's dialogue is verbatim from the story, which is another plus--no one wrote dialogue like Heinlein. Of course, the movie expands considerably on the 12-page story, but the extra ""stuff"" is well integrated and organic.

Anything else I'd say could be a spoiler for the complex, mind-bending plot. You probably already know the kicker anyway, but why take a chance?

So give ""Predestination"" a try if you're interested in a decent adaptation of one of the better-known short stories written almost 50 years ago by the Grand Master of Science Fiction.

As a result, it feels like the movie is bashing you over the head with the clues, and you almost can't help but to see what's coming from miles away.

That the movie isn't completely ruined by that is an accomplishment in itself, though. The movie is pretty to look at, the performances are adequate for the most part, and there's still some interest in seeing how things get to where they're going, even if you know where that is already.

story of his past when he was once a girl 'Jane' (Sarah Snook) someone way back had ruined her life, the BarKeep tells him
that he knows who it was.....The Barkeep works for the Space Corp, but not as a astronaut, he's a 'temporal-agent' who's job it
is to return to the past and prevent crimes before they happen.
He will take 'John/Jane' back to the time when the future changed for her, to give her/him a chance to kill the man who had in
her mind ruined her/his life...........it will become a reality check.
Barkeep has one last task to complete he must pursue the one criminal he'd thus far failed to face and kill throughout his career.
This is an intriguing sci-fi tale, though it cannot be described as exciting, it pulls you in as the film untangles, both leads put in
quite a shift, though 'Sarah Snook' steals it in truth.

However, disregarding that for a moment, even though the actors were brilliant, this movie had terrible pacing, and a story plot that could have been summed up with a child's ""what if"" in a single sentence. The movie should have been a short film at an independent film company, instead of the long-drawn out drivel that was churned out.

You'll enjoy the movie just fine without reading the story, but then you'll have deprived yourself of the pleasure of reading the very best time-travel story ever written, and one of the greatest short stories in the English language, period.
Besides, you will enjoy watching the movie more if you read the story.  In places, you may find yourself speaking along with the characters as they deliver their lines -- which is very appropriate for a time travel story that turns back on itself over and over.
Oh, also, this review contains potential spoilers, so you should stop reading this review and go read ""All You Zombies"" before reading further.
The film is remarkable in how it respects the intelligence of the audience, expecting us to understand concepts like the obsolete future of an old science fiction story.  ""Predestination"" is set in an alternate version of the 1960s and '70s, complete with the brazen sexism of the period.
The performances are brilliant, although I am disappointed by Sarah Snook's performance as a man.  I have certainly seen much better ""trouser roles"", as they used to be called.  Snook is brilliant as both a man and a woman, but as she sits in the bar she looks less like a man than she does Amelia Earhart.  I can't help but think that Miriam Shor (who played Yitzhak in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") could have filled that role even better.
I hate to criticize Snook, because she did a very good job of portraying a woman suddenly finding herself in a man's body and trying to adapt to her situation.  She really went the extra mile as an actor by appearing on-camera with a bare male chest and even just a glimpse of a penis.
I do have to say one more thing about the original story: our hero is kidding himself if he thinks he knows where he came from.  He is obviously the product of a vast, subtle and manipulative time-travel agency which makes the Temporal Authority he works for seem like a small town public library.",1432944000,,2082,4.651226158038147

6865298,5,B00Q8KCS60,"I never knew this film even existed. I bought this not knowing anything about it...

If you're looking for a thought-provoking film with dialogue ""Which came first? Chicken or the egg? Snake that eats its own tail...""), not mindless action, with some impressive performances, from Leonardo DiCaprio... I mean, look alike (no, he's actually not in it, sorry), haha... this is for you. It makes Inception feel so simple, elementary thinking.

If you are just expecting explosions and major action type film like Looper, or have low attention span, this is DEFINITELY NOT for you.

First 50 minutes is heavy dialogue and major build up before they do any kind of time traveling or where you see it start to go somewhere - if you don't have the patience for that, again, this film is NOT for you.

Half the movie, you'll be thinking to yourself, why are we just listening to these two characters talk in the bar?? Why aren't they going after the Fizzle Bomber?! I was starting to doubt, how did this film received such high praise... I will tell you, the story/buildup in the beginning is worth the investment for the major shock value towards the ending. I don't mean to over-hype it, but I love endings that just really blows you away, like the movie Se7en.

When people say it's ""mindblowing"", yeah... it's just crazy how someone could come up with a story like this. This film involves a paradox, so it may end up hurting your brain thinking about it too much. I have not seen many movies this complex and insane.

The movie plot is simply described as a time traveling agent going after a terrorist bomber to prevent it before happening... However, this makes people, or at least, it made me think it was going to be more action-type film like Minority Report -- it's NOT.  (I'm surprised by the ""Editorial Review"" on this Amazon page - it should be revised because there's an unnecessary information that gives WAY too much away there.)

It should be confusing when you first watch it. This is a film that actually gets better with a second viewing.

Ethan Hawke is an awesome actor. I'm a fan of him even more now after watching this film. I've never heard of Sarah Snook before, but she gives a versatile performance as well.

Predestination may not be a high budget film/marketing like Looper, which may be the reason why it was so low-key, and it somewhat has an indie feel, I consider it a classic and quite powerful.

If you want a film that leaves you with lots of discussion and enjoy analyzing, this film is for you. I watched a few days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it/discussing it.

This film is actually quite depressing when you really think about it.

Somewhat similar films (although these are more higher budget/involve more action):
- Looper
- Interstellar
- Minority Report
- Edge of Tomorrow
- Oblivion
- Shutter Island
- Fight Club

6865305,5,B00Q8KCS60,"What a great movie.  However, I'll make three points about this movie.  Many others have written about the movie's storyline and plot itself, so I'll skip that in preference to giving you some advice (free advice is always worth what you pay for it) about the movie experience itself and maybe how to get more enjoyment from it.

1.  You have to be somewhat of a sci-fi fan (or hard core is better) to appreciate the subtleties and nuances that this movie creates.  There are some plot holes, but those can easily be ignored considering the nature of the material.

2.  You have to pay attention.  There is a lot going on and if you drift off, you can easily get lost.  Pay attention from the opening scene as it sets up the basis for the rest of the movie and the ending.

3.  As soon as you finish the movie, your first thought will probably be:  ""I need to watch that again"".  Do so!!  You will be able to appreciate how well the writers and director created the time travel experience as well as hitting every mark.  I was amazed at how meticulous they were in getting all the minor subtle points absolutely spot on.  (Hint:  watch for Ethan Hawke's line right after they take the bandages off in the second scene.  It's an indication of how well they knew their direction and goal).

Enjoy this movie, it's one of the best Sci-Fi movies Hollywood has done in a very long time.",1431993600,4,1381,4.387351778656127

The reason I say that is because The Barkeep (Ethan Hawke)  travels through time to try and stop a criminal that studied him and has committed attacks on the country, but instead of finding him, he falls in love with himself when he was still a girl.  The story gets really long and boring to the point where you won't care anymore and will probably turn it off.  I don't recommend this movie to anybody.",1431907200,2,432,4.3625

The problem is that the plot was just simply implausible because the theory behind it is just simply impossible! It didn't take long to see where this movie was headed and I spent the last two thirds of the movie thinking they're really going to go there? I think the Spierig Brothers did a great job with what they had to work with but even in the realm of human Syfy the movie is a theoretical fallacy predestined to fail.

6865381,5,B00Q8KCS60,"This is a Sci-fi, suspense thriller at it's finest.  I love the acting, the story line, and the concept was crazy.  You really need to follow the movie and not get distracted.  Don't watch  it with a motor mouth friend, you'll miss something.  I've watched it twice since seeing it, and I think I'm due for a 3rd time this weekend or the next.  Mayweather vs. Pacquaio fight is this weekend, so actually I'll probably watch this the next.

The story line is deep, the concept the is intricate, and the Director did a great job of tying everything together.  Ethan  Hawke did a great job, and he's probably a little underrated as an Actor.  He could definitely be the lead in more movies I think.  He's good at conveying different emotions.  The lead female actress Sarah Snook was phenomenal.  Never saw here in a movie before, but she did a great job and played her role well.

But props definitely goes to the Director Michael Spierig, as this was not an easy movie to direct, and it may take a few watches to fully grasp and understand everything.  It took me 2 watches, and I may find something else out in the 3rd.  You know a movie is good when you can watch multiple times and still enjoy it like it was the first time.

6865387,5,B00Q8KCS60,"I rented this one on a whim the other day without knowing anything about it. I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi flick, and when I saw, ""Inspired by a Robert A. Heinlein story"" on the cover, my mind was made up. This film really hearkens back to the golden era sci-fi sensibilities. You can tell the original story was written in the late 50s. There is an awe for science, and a hearty joy in speculating over what scientific advancements might entail. It's actually almost a childlike joy of exploration, although there is some pretty dark material in this film. What it lacks in scientific maturation, it makes up for in literary aspiration.

This might very well be the perfect time travel story. I am not going to get into the details for fear of ruining the film, but I will say that when you step aside and consider the narrative, you'll be impressed at how deftly handled the whole film is manufactured. This is the kind of story that could very easily become a rambling mess leaving even an intelligent viewership in a haze of confusion. The Spierig brothers walk a fine line between revelation and necessary confusion, and masterfully direct viewers to revelations right at their peak moments of readiness to absorb them.

This is a true science fiction work because the human element is displaced slightly in favor of what is essentially a time anomaly. If you ""read"" this film in terms of a human drama, it is heart-rending, but in terms of a temporal anomaly, there is some justification. The essential concept is a paradox on the most basic level of time travel discussions, but the literary component of the narrative makes it work, and the result is an appealing, mind-bending film that will have you contemplating the nature of reality.

I was a little disappointed to see a film this good go so completely under the radar, but it seems ""under the radar"" is exactly where I find all the best works of art these days. The truth is the mass of cell-phone addicted idiots are not capable of enduring a story like this. But don't take my word for it, give it a look yourself. It will show you the true potential of next level literature.",1430352000,6,2144,4.592689295039165

In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually pre-determinism"". I like the thought of a time travel movie, but this was beyond my ability to follow or comprehend. THEREFORE- IF IT TASTES BAD it is bad.

6865400,4,B00Q8KCS60,"I've read many reviews here that complain that Predestination bills itself as a Sci-fi action movie but turns out to be a ""transgender drama.""

It is not an action movie, although it IS far from boring.  And yes, it is technically a drama with gender issues and only a scene or two of violence.  But is that bad?  The acting is excellent, with the Sarah Snook doing an exceptional job and Ethan Hawke being better than usual (although I think he's a serviceable actor in general).

My biggest complaint with the reviews that sell this movie short is how they either say basically nothing except they hated it, or pigeonhole it as a gender film or too twisted in it's time travel aspect.  This movie, as with the short story behind it, transcends both time travel and gender, weaving them together so the whole is more than the sum of it's parts.  But...and this is a big but...you have to pay attention!

This is, as you may or may not know, a film adaptation of Robert Heinlein's ""All You Zombies,"" which tells the extraordinary story of a visitor to the bar where Ethan Hawke is tending.  I first became aware of this story while reading a serious, non-fiction book on time travel, and physicists agree that this Heinlein's story is entirely consistent in it's time travel elements and how that contributes to who and what the characters are.  In other words, if you can accept for 90 minutes that time travel is possible, the story, complex as it is, obeys the rules.  And it's absolutely mind-blowing amazing!  I won't give spoilers, but you can find out as much as you want on Google, or let yourself be surprised.

This is a fascinating watch for all the old-school reasons:  A great story, superb acting and dialogue, and character development that grab on and won't let you go, if only you give it the chance.  Sorry, you won't find huge explosions, high-speed car chases and slow-mo gunfights.  You'll, I hope as I did, find a gripping, dramatic story that is an excellent watch because it's an excellent story.

6865402,1,B00Q8KCS60,"Really disliked this movie.  While the treatment of the paradox and time loop was more novel than some other time travel moves/books, the fundamental story left a lot to be desired.  I figured out where they were going with some of the plot points halfway through, and toughed the movie out to see how they resolved what was positioned as the original issue for the movie - stopping the bomber.

I thought the resolution of that plot point was unsatisfying;  the presentation of much of the story for the movie from one characters long speech in a bar was odd, and other things that went on were weird just for the sake of being weird.

Just say no.  I wish I could go back in time, and convince myself to watch something else last night - but I guess some things were just predestined.",1429920000,5,786,4.423611111111111

My wife was unfamiliar with the original story, but she and I both enjoyed it. This may be a film that is better if watched twice; some of the dialogue is more humorous or more understandable if you know where the characters are coming from or heading toward.

This is not new, the only 2 successful film versions of his work were 1) The color film ""Destination Moon"", circa 1950s was excellent, mainly because R.A.H. served as technical adviser on the film.  2) The original Black-and-white ""B"" movie version of ""The Puppet Masters"", circa 1950s-1960s, which had more insight into the story, and more energy, than the later color version!  On the other hand was the absolute butchering of ""Starship Troopers"" which no doubt had Mr. Heinlein spinning in his grave.  ""Predestination"" was the work of an Australian film company (what do they know of R.A.H.).  For some reason, the premier was held in Texas?????  Why?????

6865459,5,B00Q8KCS60,"This movie, with Ethan Hawkes in the leading role, just came out on Blu-Ray a few days ago.  I knew the vaguest bit about the plot: something about time-travel and trying to stop crimes before they occur.  Ergo, science fiction, right?  Well the last science fiction movie with time travel that came to my mind was Loopers, with Bruce Willis.  It would be hard to make a sci-fi film with time travel that is any LESS like Loopers than Predestination.

I am not going to give away the plot, but Ill start by saying its rare to see any science-fiction film thats set in the recent PAST, rather than in the future.  And it still manages to be entertaining, even engrossing.  Second: there are enough clues provided that many viewers will figure out major plot points somewhat before they are explicitly announced in the film.  Yet I ended the show feeling like, even though I understood the basics of what had happened, there was still this atmosphere of mystery, leaving me feeling as if I had stared into a deep pool and only seen a portion of what lay therein.  Much credit for the atmosphere must be given to the musical score, which was so well-done that I watched almost the entirety of the credits just to listen to the music which was still playing.

It also gravitates more to the cerebral than to an action-film (although action does occur, to be sure).  But a lot of the film is taken up with dialog and character development rather than rushing a bunch of action and violence at the audience.  So, be prepared for the plot to unwind slowly at first.  In that sense, Im not even sure why its rated R rather than PG-13; not only do many R-rated movies depict worse; Ive even seen PG-13 movies that I felt had more violence or other explicit material than this one. Whether you consider it R or PG-13, it still had an interesting plot, well-acted, fine cinematography, with a fantastic musical score, and was really worth seeing.  There are also some 75 to 90 minutes of bonus material on the Blu-Ray (which I haven't viewed yet so I cant comment on the value, but its nice to see they did throw the bonus featurettes in).  As others have observed, the plot was based on a short story by Robert Heinlein (sometimes called the grand daddy of science fiction; he wrote prolifically, and many of his works remain masterpieces in the genre) and the film even quotes from the title in one spot: ""I know who I am, but where did all YOU zombies come from?""

Unfortunately the movie drags. The makers spend way too much time on the original story and not nearly enough of the part that has been added on. Part of this was needed to weave in the added sub-plot but it was just too much. A lot could have been improved by updating the original story, Heinlein wrote it when movie space ships were rockets that landed on their tail fins and a Mars and/or Venus colony were just a short time away.

Based on a short-story by Robert Heinlein, the theme of the movie expands on ideas from that short story and perhaps even from another book by the author called ""Time enough for love"". Is it a love story? (If you need it to be so you can call it a date-night movie - then YES it is that), Is it an adventure? Yes. Is it a drama? Yes. Is it a comedy? Well, maybe - there are some funny quirks of the time-travel paradox and some underlying currents that you may not get the first time through until the full depth of the paradox is revealed.

6865551,4,B00Q8KCS60,"This film by the Spierig Brothers comes from ""Down Under"" and features a couple fine performances.  Ethan Hawke, to no surprise and newcomer Sarah Snook who few have ever heard of.  Hawke plays The Barkeep and we determine early on that he is a temporal agent who jumps back and forth throughout time.  His mission is to avert catastrophes before they happen.  In his current case he is trying to catch a madman from 1977, known as the ""The Fizzle Bomber.""  He's tried and failed before.  His cover is a bartender.

Late one night he meets a stranger in the bar (Sarah Snook) who agrees to tell him a story that is so unbelievable that if he agrees, the barkeep must cough up a fine bottle of whiskey.  She tells the story of an unmarried woman, whose baby was stolen shortly after being born.  To say much more would give away much of the surprise and suspense.

The story is an adaptation by the Spierig's of famed sci-fi writer Robert A. Heinlein's ""All You Zombies.""  And it's a good one.  This is a small budgeted film that had a limited release in the U. S. in January, 2015.  So don't expect a lot of razzle-dazzle special effects.  Instead look for a mind-bending alternative that will have you guessing throughout.  Pay attention to everything including things that seem to be innocuous and enjoy the intelligent and dizzying ride.

The Blu ray transfer comes with 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While the overall look of the film is lit with restraint, the detail is excellent.  The appearance of color is well done, but retains the overall muted hue.  I could see no abnormalities with the transfer.  Looks great.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option and it is terrific.  Again, no blockbuster special effects, but there are action sequences that resonate well throughout the surrounds.  Dialog is perfectly placed, clear and consistent.  Subtitles include English SDH, French and Spanish.  Extras include some bloopers, a short on cast performances, previews of Sony films and 76 minute feature called ""Bringing Predestination to Life."" All in all, recommended, especially for sci-fi buffs.",1427414400,,2140,4.8292011019283745

6865569,4,B00Q8KCS60,"Under-the-radar, concept-driven science fiction with a heavy dose of suspense. Ethan Hawke plays a decade-leaping ""temporal agent,"" dedicated to stopping the spree of a mysterious mass bomber who wipes out several blocks of New York City in the late 20th century. Along the way, he randomly stops by a bar in 1978 where he settles in to share stories with a down-on-his-luck patron and the plot seems to derail. It's strange, confusing pacing that sets aside the core concept in lieu of a very long, seemingly-unrelated aside, but naturally there's more here than meets the eye. That digression is an intriguing one, albeit in a completely different vein than the advertised premise, and tucks neatly into the endgame during the film's chaotic, full-throttle closing act. Fans of Total Recall and Inception will find themselves mesmerized by the percussive power of its late plot twists, even if they are made a hair less ambiguous than I think was really necessary. These are some pretty big swings, and they'll probably turn off a good portion of the audience, but I enjoy that kind of risk-taking and it feels like they transform what had been a mediocre also-ran into something much closer to the remarkable.",1427241600,2,1212,5.0049504950495045

6865581,5,B00Q8KCS60,"This film is based on a story by Robert Heinlein, and explores ""the Grandfather Pardox"", which asks what happens if someone uses time travel to visit the past, and interact with their own grandparents (sometimes killing one or both) in a manner which prevents them from ever having children, thus preventing the time traveler from ever being born. In this way, it resembles the film ""Looper"", which also has people from the future visiting people in the past.
In ""Predestination"" a secret government organization exists which seeks to prevent large disasters before they occur, by going into the past and stopping the people who cause those disasters. One agent is also a recruiter for this organization, and part of the story is his attempts to convince one particular person in the past to join.
There are multiple loops forward and backward in time, so you have to pay attention to understand what is happening. When the true nature of what was going on dawned on me, I was astonished.

6865598,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Directed by the Spierig Brothers and Starring Ethan Hawke and rising actress Sarah Snook, Predestination is adapted from the Robert A. Heinlein story, ""-All You Zombies-,"" a story that deals with time travel and the predestination paradox (i'd look it up; it would take up the whole review to explain in detail). Hawke's character meets the Unmarried Mother, a customer at the bar he tends, and the bartender shows his patron something unbelievable; he's a time traveler, a temporal agent who's sole purpose is to find the Fizzle Bomber, and change human history.

Predestination is not the first film of its kind, but it certainly is original, even if adapted from a previous work, as it expands on Heinlein's story, bringing to light new elements and details, while still keeping a great deal away from the viewer's eye. The film is superb in every way, bringing both entertainment value and cinematic value into a short and sweet sci-fi thriller. The Spierig Brothers, who previously directed Daybreakers, are in top-form, carefully weaving together their screenplay with their focused and unflinching direction, creating a tense, and unknowing atmosphere as the characters move through different times. The acting was very brilliant, with Sarah Snook being the stand-out among the cast, but not topping completely Hawke's performance, which is one of (if not the) best performance he's given. The production and visual effects were surprisingly incredible for such a low-budget film, and there was never a moment where the film seemed out of its depth. Honestly, i really think these two brothers should stick with science fiction, because their delivery of Predestination couldn't have been done any other way without either straining the plot, revealing too much or a number of other problems that could arise.

Predestination is a true sci-fi film, and if you are not a fan of anything science fiction related, do not watch this. If you like a good mind-bender, a thriller that keeps you guessing or a simply well-made movie, look no further. This is a must-see and a must-own.

It's been 20 years or more since I've read any Robert Heinlein stories, but I don't think there were many that I haven't. Still, I didn't remember anything about the short story ""All You Zombies"", other than the title. So I can't say how similar this was, but it sure had the same feel as a Heinlein story. Certainly more so than any past movies have to date. I'm probably one of the few people who liked the Starship Troopers movie. But the book was vastly better and very little of what was in that book made it to the movie.

I found Predestination to be fairly predictable. Actually I more or less figured it out very early on. But I think that's because I've read most of Heinlein's stories. However this movie was wonderfully acted and written. I'm not going to say enough to ruin this movie for anyone, but even knowing how it would end, it was very enjoyable watching it all unfold. I really liked how they put the movie in one of Heinlein's alternate reality timelines too. I do wish they didn't feel the need to club the audience over the head with the ending.

Although you can guess it before it has ended, that doesn't make the story simple.

In other areas, the acting by all the characters is great, and the execution of the story makes you feel for the characters.

I think the reason this movie gets a large dose of bad reviews is it makes you think.  People generally hate movies that they have to think about I have found.

6865667,5,B00Q8KCS60,"I have always loved time travel films & shows.  The Terminator, H.G. Wells: The Time Machine, and of course Doctor Who are all great examples of this particular slice of sci-fi heaven.  But I have felt for some time now (excluding Doctor Who) that time travel films/shows needed some freshness, the same old tried & true plots have been Way overdone.

Enter Predestination a brand new movie that does not fail to deliver.  This piece of cinema is a masterpiece, a word I do not use too often.  It is a thinking mans science fiction movie to be sure, one that will have you pondering its themes for days, long after the credits roll.  On the surface the premise is simple; a time traveling agent is trying to stop a terrorist from detonating a bomb that will kill 10,000 New Yorkers.  But the story is SO much more complex than this.  This film has everything: time paradoxes, action, and emotion  you will really feel for the Jane character, I was almost brought to tears at times (this is coming from a man who has only cried twice while watching movies:  Old Yeller being shot, and Jack dying in Titanic).

Acting wise this film is blessed with the talents of veteran actor Ethan Hawke & new-comer Sarah Snook, along with Noah Taylor.  Hawke as always delivers a fantastic performance, but I feel its Snook who really pulls at the heart strings in this one.  As her character goes through its transformation you feel as if you are watching the same person die multiple times.  (Youll know what I mean after watching)

I highly recommend you hit the web after watching this movie; you will have questions or simply want to see if your conclusions are correct.  A good site I came across is:
http://www.astronomytrek.com/predestination-2014-explained/  -- this site really has some good discussions going on right now.

To Buy or Rent?
I personally would say buy on this one, as it is going to be a repeat watch.  I will definitely be watching this again soon, and if I can convince anyone else to give it a shot, I will be watching it with them  constantly saying Now watch this part closely.  I personally bought my copy from Wal-Mart for 14.96, not a bad price for a recently released movie.

--In Conclusion
A solid film, a real head scratcher at times, and a movie that you Will be thinking about for quite some time after.

6865728,3,B00Q8KCS60,"Ethan Hawke is an unnamed agent who travels back in time to stop the Fizzle Bomber terrorizing the people of New York City. At first sight the story of Predestination looks like that of a typical sci-fi action, but you soon notice that something is different or unique about this film based on a Robert A. Heinlein short. And some may not like this uniqueness.

In 1970, Hawkes character is seen working as a bartender, and he starts a casual conversation with one of the customers. The customer, obviously unhappy, says he is a writer for the magazine True Confessions, and what he has to confess is the most amazing story he knows. The bartender listens to him, and realizes that he is not lying.

Dont expect something like gadgets or cat-and-mouse chases. Predestination is a film built on one idea, or dilemma, that you may have heard of. As directors Michael and Peter Spierig (Daybreakers) tackle the idea with a unique approach, focusing the characters and what they have to say, rather than their actions.

This is a nice approach, but the problem is that some viewers, if they are careful enough, can predict what is to be revealed. That is fine, you may think. The film is well-acted and makes you think, but still needs a climax that matches the strong first two-thirds. Predestination is a smart sci-fi film, but after you leave the theater, you may think the fillm could have been more thought-provoking with a less contrived narrative.",1425686400,,1450,4.746031746031746

This would never happen even if time travel were possible.  It's so ridiculous it's aggravating (they didn't have to make her a man, even if that happened she wouldn't just start producing sperm, even if that happened who would sleep with them self, even if that happened how would you give birth to yourself!

It also turns out the herm is the villain, a unibomber in the future, that he/she has been trying to stop and ends up killing himself when he/she is old.

6865766,5,B00Q8KCS60,"With those words opens the new science fiction masterpiece PREDESTINATION. Based on the short story by Robert Heinlein the movie stars Ethan Hawke as a mysterious man on a mission. Sent from the future hes part of a group that travels back in time to correct situations that have happened saving millions of lives in the process.

When the film opens hes walking down a corridor saying asking this question What if I could put him in front of you; the man who ruined your life. If I could guarantee you could get away with it. Would you kill him? From there he spots a man planting a bomb, they fight and hes caught in an explosion that gives him massive third degree burns. When he wakes, hes in a hospital covered in bandages and told that he may heal but hell look completely different.

With this opening we discover the world of the temporal police from the future, who go back in time to prevent cataclysmic acts from happening. In this case it was a bomber known as the fizzle bombers whose last act was the set off a bomb in New York that killed 11,000 people. After healing, Hawke is returned for one last mission since it wreaks havoc with you brain after so many trips. He ends up in a bar where he works as a bartender when a young man comes in.

This is the slow part of the film but sets in motion almost all of the rest. The young man sits in the bar that Hawke now works in. Making small talk he reveals that he is an author of sorts, the writer of the column The Unwed Mother in a womans magazine. As the talk, the two men make a bet as to who can tell the better story between the two of them. As the author begins, he lets Hawke know that he was once a woman. This tragic tale involves the young womans journey, being left on the doorstep of an orphanage, her time as a youngster with few friends to her being romanced after becoming old enough to leave and then abandoned by the man she thought loved her. Not only abandoned but pregnant as well.

It is here where she discovers she was born with both sexual organs. Due to problems with her pregnancy she was given a hysterectomy but the doctors discovered both sexual organs and were able to make her a man now. As she finishes her now his story Hawke offers his tale, one of time travel. Rather than explain it, he shows the young man instead.

As the pair travel in time more of the story is revealed, slowly unspooling in directions that you think might seem familiar at first but that take a right turn where a left was expected time and time again. It keeps you thinking whats going to happen next? Not only that but each twist and turn while incomprehensible as they take place makes perfect sense when you get to the end of the picture. Its brilliant.

The movie didn't make a big splash when it was released, a smaller film that drew little attention but high praise. Thats sad because this ended up being one of the most original and entertaining films Ive seen this past year. It qualifies as an artistic and entertainment achievement, something few films achieve.

The film has an expensive look to it while being a low budget picture. The directing is wonderful getting top notch performances out of both leads, Hawke as well as Sarah Snook as the Unwed Mother author. The pacing of the movie seems slow at first but in a good way, like peeling off the layers one at a time to reveal some new piece of information, each one blowing your mind more than the last. By the end of the film you have a very fulfilling story that makes you want to go back and revisit the movie again to see if you could have caught all the clues that were laid out for you from the start. Even knowing those answers I don't think its possible even though they are there.

There are plenty of blockbusters coming out on DVD last week, this week and next but I would highly recommend watching this movie instead. Make sure that you can pay attention to the film from start to finish. Turn off the phone, don't answer the door and make sure the kids are in bed.

Imagine you find something.  You look at it and see what appears to be a box, wrapped in cloth.  You take time, slowly opening and unwrapping the cloth.  You see a picture, on the cloth.  It is beautiful and keeps you interested.  You continue to unwrap, only to see a second picture.  Once more, you continue only to find, yet another picture.  You see there is not much left to unwrap, so you continue, only to find, yet another picture.  Then, you come to the realization that what you have been unwrapping, in a huge comforter, that was wrapped into itself.  Though the four images are completely different, you look at it from afar and realize that, though they are different, they all fit together, not just by the fabric that makes the comforter, but in a much more complex way.

I cannot be sure if that makes sense.  But, it does to me.  I cannot believe this movie is not more talked about.  I rented it and will now buy it.  Amazing.",1424908800,,1039,4.361256544502618

I love time travel movies, I love science fiction stories, this movie can barely be considered either. I get that the writers were trying to go for profound or unique, but this was completely pointless and stupid. The plot made no sense, and pardon the pun, fizzled out entirely. For those who haven't read the plot line, the cop is chasing the Fizzle Bomber. *** Spoiler Alerts *** A transgender woman becomes a man then goes back in time to fall in love with his female self, only to get his past female self pregnant then leave with a time travelling cop from 1981 who is trying to enlist him. The cop then steels the female versions baby once she gives birth only to leave it on a doorstep in the past which is actually the same person. So, let me recap. The male version got the female version of himself pregnant and the time traveling cop steels the baby and goes back in time because the baby is actually the same person that gave birth to it. OK, got it? I hope you do because it has no relevance to the movie or story. Now back to the Fizzle Bomber, the cop is the bomber and he catches up with himself and shoots himself. End of story.

6865873,5,B00Q8KCS60,"WOW! This movie is a MUST see for fans of time travel films!  But please, if you want to go in fresh, stay away from detailed reviews and spoilers (which might be tough).  My review does not reveal any plot twists.

Based on a shot story, All You Zombies, by Robert A. Heinlein, this movie is a refreshing change of pace from most time travel movies.

In a typical time travel movie, the protagonist has to go back and change something to positively affect the future. In this movie, the protagonist understands and has to consider all actions, both positive and negative, made in the past. This movie equally treats the bad and the good events in the past as crucial to shaping the future. Preserving these moments in harmony with one another is not always the easy choice, but one our main character constantly has to weigh.

The plot, though intricately woven, is easy enough to follow (AFTER watching this, there are a great number of websites with time travel ""flow charts"" to reference, all useful BTW). If you are paying full attention while watching the movie, however, it will make sense.

Another notable comment, the acting from Sarah Snook and Ethan Hawke is top notch.  They have a true chemistry, and are both at the top of their crafts, though at different points in their careers. Snook is definitely an actress to keep an eye on in the future. It is also great to see a sci-fi movie driven by the characters, not the special effects, aliens, or gadgets, etc.  Even the time machine device itself is a simple, retrofitted musical instrument case.

This is how sci-fi can be done without a big budget, and all the bells and whistles mandated by a major studio.  Story is always the most important entity in a movie, yet somehow ignored in the majority of today's cinema. After watching, enjoying, and digesting this movie, I sat there angry at how major studios with all of their resources consistently pass on gems like this.

This is a future cult classic, and hopefully will open up plenty of exciting new opportunities for the Spierig brothers. I can't wait to watch their careers unfold.  I enjoyed Daybreakers, I loved this movie, and the sky is the limit for them.  They are permanently on my director's watch list. Until their next film, however, enjoy a time travel masterpiece!!

6865875,4,B00Q8KCS60,"Great thinking movie about time travel. More story and little flash, I think that there should be more sci-fi like this. I do like to see cool tech and  all, but nowadays it seems like that's all sci-fi has become. A flimsy plot, bland, generic characters and then a big flashy world and cool looking gadgets that distract us from the story which could take place at any time.

Movies like Elysium, After Earth could have taken place in the dark ages, 20th century or whenever. The only thing that made them sci-fi was the gadgets, But make the space station a castle, the forbidden planet an unmapped island and the spaceship a boat, the exoskeleton/suit into armor, a despotic king with assassins/an escaped criminal, catapults/crossbows/swords/staff and boom, an adventure story instead of sci-fi. But a movie like Predestination is classic sci-fi because it has to be.

The plot revolves around time travel and not cool, flashy gizmos. It couldn't happen otherwise. There are gizmos, but they're not flashy. They're built to blend in to the environment It has a strong, interesting story, characters who grow and are interesting  and you care about them. You need to think and understand things like paadoxes and time loops. It also delves into psychology, self discovery and self-analsis. I'd love to see more like this and Automata which delve deeper into story over effects.

6865879,5,B00Q8KCS60,"First, this review is an explanation of the movies events  so if you don't want any STOP NOW.

Most films about time travel tend to take the view that time is immutable and cannot be changed. This movie takes the view that time is not fixed but can be altered by time traveling agents. This idea has already been accepted by fans of the new Cris Pine and Zachary Quinto, Kirk and Spock, of the new JJ Abrahams Alternate Star Trek Time Stream Universe. (it took a while but I have warmed up to it). It really gives the Star Trek franchise a ton of latitude for more movies because the characters aren't constrained to repeat history exactly in the same way as the original series.

So, what we have in essence is a story about a man who started life as a woman but through intercourse with his future self as a man gives birth to a baby that through time travel is deposited in an orphanage and grows up to become his future self who he finally kills and closes the loop. (Think the movie Looper). This is set against the backdrop of a time agent's pursuit of a serial bomber who turns out to be a further future self and they are all the same person. Baby, Woman, Man, Time agent, Bomber all the same person at different times.

Which came first ? The chicken or the egg ?  In this movie both.

The idea would not seem so outr if we were a species capable of  self-reproduction and had only one sex. Jerry the Drax spontaneously became pregnant in ""Enemy mine"" and gave birth to Zamis who was Godfathered by Willis Davitch, a human.

It helps if you think of this story as only a thread inside a larger universe. If a person's life is a thread then it has a beginning and end. BUT along comes time travel. So in this case the thread loops back on itself. We the viewer are in the larger Universe in the movie so we can see the loop.
All that said I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to Sci - Fi fans of movies that make you think.

I just watched this movie again and noticed an interesting anomaly. In the closing scenes John shoots his future self once then six more times with an obvious revolver. A Seven - Shooter ? He must have borrowed the revolver from the guy in the movie ""Legend of the Golden Gun.""

The producers/directors added a sub-plot that wasn't in the original story, but it helps fill out the movie.  The overall look is very film noir, but the sets are mostly well done, with a little CGI  to fill in outdoor scenes.
All in all, it was a satisfying film to me, a long-time Heinlein fan.  It was much better than Veerhoven's butcher job of ""Starship Troopers"", which basically just shared the name and some of the characters.",1424390400,,615,4.5636363636363635

6865912,5,B00Q8KCS60,"This finely acted time travelling sci-fi starts like an action film and soon reveals itself to be one of the most intimate and tender stories of any genre. A time cop from the future must set the past right, leading to his getting a job as a 1970s bartender so he can hear the life story of the most strangely brilliant and devastated character hes ever met. In astonishing developments, the film soon answers the question of what would it be like to meet yourself and discover more love for that self than you knew existed? The story is consistent with space-time as a construct of higher beings who are leading us to give and receive the self-love that comes from our soul, for until we do there is in effect no one else but ourselves to meet in the world. Ive never seen a plot device that so poignantly conveyed a reunion of the inner selves, including the inner man (animus), inner woman (anima), inner child, teen, and parent, and even the inner nemesis (negative ego). This movie is actually a faithful adaptation that improves on its source, the award winning short story by author Robert Heinlein, who starting in the 1950s uniquely transformed the science fiction genre into a place for deep transpersonal inquiry and eternal spiritual ideas with startling masterpieces like Stranger in a Strange Land. He wrote (clearly channeled) the story of Predestination in a single day, and called it -All You Zombies-. This necessitated a title change for the film since there are no literal zombies, only the main character finally wondering who or what are all the other people in the world, given that he has met himself in so many ways that he now only knows where he comes from. The story stops there, for it is the end and beginning of all time at that point, as the fulfillment of purpose turns to a realization of the souls love as the basis for any existence.

Taken from a (very) short story ""All You Zombies"" this is true to the story and MORE.  It filled in a lot of the details in what RAH left to the imagination with sights and sounds and action and dialogue the story was very short on but very rich in its depth despite the brevity.

The screenwriters kept in many of the details, little things, like the name of the bourbon and, just as with many of RAH's stories, the end left you wanting more, or to start again at the beginning.

The film is based on a short story and didn't evolve much past that point, adding a lot of filler in an attempt to say, ""look at how clever we are.""

The theme, which is a bit of a PLOT SPOILER, was not well developed.  It is a take off of an old philosophy morals/ethic question, ""If you could kill Hitler as a child, would you do it?"" What if your killing Hitler had to result in the deaths of a few thousand innocent people? After all you would save millions of lives. Of course there is never the option of speaking to Hitler and influencing him as a child to take a different path which is why I never liked hypothetical questions that pigeon hole your options.

This movie really illustrates the chicken or the egg conundrum.  The movie itself is entertaining but I felt gets a bit lost in itself with its story within a story within a story.

I will naturally assume you have seen the movie and perhaps have read the original story as well.

Heinlein's short story was published in the March 1959 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and as was his fashion, it is terse and mind-bending (not to mention gender-bending, as he was a bit ahead of his time regarding his perception of social issues). The first time I read it, I was stunned, and immediately read it again to try to get my mind around it. ""The Snake That Eats Its Own Tail, Forever and Ever,"" or as the movie puts it, ""Which `comes' first, the chicken or the egg"" (the rooster, of course). It wasn't until I watched the movie that the impossibility occurred to me; if you trace the timeline back to before Jane exists, she cannot possibly come into being. It is only if you begin the story in the middle that it becomes plausible.

Like any good movie, it left me thinking-in this case about existence without beginning. My initial disappointment at the impossibility of the story changed to a more philosophical bent. We all suppose we know where we come from, thanks in part to science-two parents, who were descended from others of our kind, and back through evolution to more basic life forms, and (disregarding the lack of actual step-by-step evidence) the beginnings of life from inert, inorganic chemicals, from which point we know roughly how the universe evolved and began. However, even the beginnings of the universe are debatable, with a very recent theory put forth that it existed before the Big Bang, and is, in other words, eternal. Even if the Big Bang was the start of everything, it still begs the question of what came before. Thinking about that unsettles most people (including scientists); a universe with no beginning and perhaps no end. We came in in the middle of the story.

In making the movie, the Spierig brothers resisted updating the story to the present, and everything takes place in our past. A few implausibilities exist, such as the difference between Hawk's and Snook's  physique (the directors minimized their 6"" difference in height, but skull shape, which would not have been affected by the burns, is substantially different, making acceptance of the older John as the same person as the younger Jane/John more difficult). Excellent filmmaking technique produced a noir-ish look that preserved the dated feel, and Peter Spierig's understated and often disturbing score only added to what I believe is a strange and affecting movie, one which deserves to be rated among the better science fiction movies made recently, and one which Heinlein himself might approve.",1423958400,,2917,4.886868686868687

Couldn't get my head around why Hollyweird wanted to tell the story of a character who literally screws her/him self, time travel style. In addition, we had to hear such a beautiful young woman talk for over 50 minutes about changing into a man Ungh I get the idea of unsolvable paradigms in time travel.

6865970,5,B00Q8KCS60,"For the first fifteen minutes of this film I wouldn't have given good odds that I would make it even to the thirty minute mark on this film. This was in part influenced by my initial perception of this being an Ethan Hawke film. Certainly all the promotional material steers you in that direction too. Just as I was getting ready to move on to some other video, Sarah Snook came onscreen with Hawke as the bartender to whom she is to tell her story. My interest in this story grew with every moment thereafter. Snook is quite simply a stellar talent who can do it all. She plays two roles here, one a male, the other a female. She covers different ages as well. She also has to play characters who encounter one horrific life event after another, never catching a break. It becomes painful at times to watch her or him. Ethan Hawke plays a man. He is always recognizable as the same person regardless of age or setting.

Add to this that the source material was written by the grand old master of sci fi himself, Heinlein, reworked into a very clever screenplay, with very clever twists, and this film ends up being one of the cult films for years to come of this genre. It is time travel with Hawke come from the future to find the one criminal terrorist who has managed to elude him for his entire career. He runs into Snook one night as he is tending bar in his latest undercover hideout  in the 20th century. To say any more about their conjoined plot would be to risk spoilers.

However, I will say that Heinlein was not focused on terrorists back when he was writing in his hey day of the mid twentieth century. So it is truly incredible that the directors and writers manage to adapt his material to say something quite profound about the modern day terrorist and terrorist activities. They have given such people a mirror which they they need to look into ASAP.",1423872000,,1869,4.41159420289855

6865981,4,B00Q8KCS60,"""Predestination"" won't be for everyone. If you're expecting an action filled science fiction flick, you'll be disappointed because this focuses more on character and drama. Based on Robert Heinlein's classic seminal time travel short story ""All You Zombies"", ""Predestinaton"" takes some unusual twists and turns. I'm not going to say that you will necessarily be surprised by what occurs (you may figure it out as all the clues are laid out pretty neatly prior to the conclusion)and I'm not going to claim this is a pefect film, but it's entertaining and worth the trip for most folks. Be aware that if paradoxes in a film bother you, this isn't a film you'll like.

Wait--before jumping to the spoilers below, I would recommend knowing as little as possible on the plot of the film.

MINOR SPOILERS:

Focusing on a time traveler in pursuit of his final elusive target, John (Ethan Hawke)undertakes one final mission to capture a terrorist operating in 1975 New York. John must stop a bombing that will destroy a city block and kill hundreds. Working undercover in a bar in hopes of catching the terrorist based on the clues he has picked up on during previous failed attempts, John encounters a writer with a most unusual story that resonantes with him.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Predestination"" continues to demonstrate that writer-directors Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig continue to prove that they can take genres that appear to be exhausted (the vampire flick ""Daybreakers"" for example which truly is a variation on Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"")and bring some new and interesting twists to genre films. They continue to grow by leaps and bounds in terms of their abilities.

Well plotted and structured, ""Predestination"" focuses on the human elements (much like the previous year's ""Looper"" did although I feel this is a much better structured, smaller film in terms of focus).

The blu-ray looks exceptionally good with nice colors (that capture the various eras portrayed in the film).  Detail is exceptionally good. Audio features a strong 5.1 mix.

The special features include a terrific documentary over an hour and fifteen minutes looks ""All You Zombies"" taking us through all elements of the production from conception to execution.

We also get a blooper reel.

We also get a four and a half minute featurette that seems largely reduntant aftr the terrific documentary on the film. It's a pity there's no commentary track for the film.

The film features two outstanding performances from actors  Sarah Snook and Hawke. The supporting players are, likewise, quite good although this truly is more of a two person dramatic science fiction flick. I would urge those of you considering this film to read spoiler free reviews or as little on the internet as possible about the project to add to your experience.

Although there are some predictable elements, the film manages to have enough surprises and twists to keep it interesting. The execution of the film is exceptionally well done.

6865988,3,B00Q8KCS60,"Heinlein or not, Predestination misses a spot.

As always, this loses a star for using CGI at all. It loses one more because It's just not that good - It only gets 3 stars, (just barely), because I am a fan of Heinlein. The performances are good, but it's too predictable. Any moderate sci-fi fan, of written sci-fi especially, can see the end coming a parsec away.

This probably would have done better left as a book, although I admit, I don't know that I have ever read the short story it is said to be based on, as Heinlein wrote it. If I did, it must not have been that memorable.

I recommend spending far less at a Redbox, to see it,  than what Amazon wants for streaming - I feel less cheated having exercised that option.

Before you comment, understand please: This is MY review. My opinion regarding the use of CGI in film has not changed in 30 years - it's not going to change today, for or because of something you or anyone else may try to point out. If practical effects are harder to do, too dangerous to do, too expensive to do - more than they are worth... write around the scene or do the WHOLE thing as a book - simple. If for no other reason, all the wonderful, talented, FX people, model makers and set designers the industry was once known for, may never work again...that's just not right - Sadly, those skills may well end up forever lost. For instance MUCH of what was generated by CGI in this movie could have been, and SHOULD have been,  hand drawn and painted , frame by frame.",1423612800,,1506,4.285211267605634

Heinlein purists will love this movie. There are lines right out of the story, and the background has things from the story, such as a jukebox playing ""I'm my own Grandpa."" There also all sorts of clever ""tells"" planted in the movie, which you will spot if you know the story.

The movie does extend the story, but not in a way that hurts the message or plot. In fact, the extension is necessary to round out the story from the standpoint of fitting a Hollywood checklist for plot closure (the story being famous for not having closure.)

I am not sure that anyone will be surprised by the plot turns, but, then, I read the story a half dozen times before I graduated from high school.

Then, I ordered the Kindle version of the original short story by Robert Heilman (sp?).  I just could not process what the story was ultimately trying to say.

One reviewer here said that this movie was an intelligence test and if you did not get it, you were a moron.  I do not agree.  I have understood much more complex movies such as ""Memento"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".

The good news is that I would encourage viewers and readers to watch and read this story.  It's not boring.  It's challenging even if you don't ultimately get it.  It's interesting to me that this movie went straight to streaming--no theater run at all.  The acting was good, especially by the ""Jane"" character.",1422489600,,847,4.617449664429531

6866032,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Predestination isn't just the best sci-fi of the year, it's one of the best sci-fi's I've seen since Minority Report or Gattaca. It's one of the best films of the year, period. It's one of the most thought-provoking, mind-bending, sharply written, fiercely original, technically adept, emotionally moving, and powerfully acted science fiction films I've ever seen. Is it ""Great great"" - like Inception/Gattaca great? Only time will tell, so I'll leave that up to you.

Based on Robert Heinlein's short story All You Zombies, a mind-bending, time-travelling, paradoxical look at causality and paradoxes, Predestination is the next film from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spierig-Brothers/dp/B003H58886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spierig Brothers</a>, two batty German geeks who might just end up taking a shot at sci-fi royalty (or at the very least, sci-fi nobility) if things keep going the way they are. The film stars&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ethan-Hawke/dp/B000I8G5B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ethan Hawke</a>&nbsp;as a mysterious character known only as The Bartender, a genial man hiding dark secrets, who also happens to be a Temporal Agent. Yeah, that's a time traveller, for those of us who don't speak nerd. Aussie newcomer Sarah Snook stars as The Unmarried Mother, a world-weary man (You read that right. And believe it or not, that is the LEAST strange thing you will find in this movie) with hurt in his past. The plot jumps backwards and forwards from its heart in the early 1970's, through flashbacks, flashforwards, and a whole lot of time-travelling. Without giving much away, it revolves around the hunt for the Fizzle Bomber, a ruthless and unpredictable terrorist whose next attack will make 9/11 look like a playground scrap.

The film starts on a snappy pace, and never lets up. This ain't a movie for the casual viewer. This is a marathon for your brain - its ruthless and hard to follow, and you'll emerge dripping with sweat and beaming with pride. Predestination isn't confusing, but it is hard to understand. Time travel, paradoxes, time-loops, alternate realities, and causality are words that make all but the staunchest sci-fi fans quiver (if I told you I understood it 100%, I'd be lying). When you throw in sex changes, facial reconstructions, and more than a twinge of uncomfortable...um, personal...relationships (you'll see what I mean), you have a mature and thoroughly different science fiction. But what takes Predestination from a neat story with a cool script, to being genuinely compelling story-telling, is the acting.

Let's talk about the cast. I've always liked Ethan Hawke. His performances have no guile or artificiality to them; he throws himself into every character with gusto and skill (kind of like a less hammy, more choosy Nic Cage). But this was the first time when I sat up and said, ""Woah. This dude has got ACTING chops."" Chops that stand up there with the greats, in what might be his best performance in years. But Hawke's fine chops aren't even the highpoint of the film. Neither is the subtle, scheming and unforgettable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah-Taylor/dp/B00K7WU85I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah Taylor</a>&nbsp;as head of the CIA's time travel agency. The highpoint of the movie is a left-field punch to the gut called Sarah Snook. Remember (and chortle at) this name, because this girl is going places. Playing the tricky character of both a woman AND a man, both with electrifying aplomb and finely-honed skill, this is Snook's film to carry, and carry it she does.

Adding to the incredible script and acting is some classy, almost retro cinematography and a damn good score, making Predestination a brain-warping and unforgettable experience for the true science fiction fan. Casual viewers may be put off by the strange themes, uncomfortable insinuations, and cortex-crunching paradoxes of the movie. But for thinking fans of science fiction, psychological thrillers, or just good ol'fashioned thrilling and smart cinema, Predestination will deliver a kick in the pants that will be sure to have you thinking and massaging your aching cranium for days. This movie is NOT to be missed. As for my rating, ever since I saw it, I knew it was predestined to get 5 stars (see what I did there, eh?).

6866034,5,B00Q8KCS60,"A mind-bending science fiction masterpiece about time travel and understanding. What exactly is supposed to be understood? Well, I won't give that away and if you choose to watch this film, you'll be happy that I didn't.

A bartender, who's actually something a bit more, starts a conversation with a surly customer. They bet a bottle of liquor that he, the customer, can tell the bartender the best story he's ever heard. This bet is the start of something amazing. He, the customer called the unmarried mother, begins this tale that caught me up like some fantastical spider's web. By the time the unmarried mother's story is over he's worked his way into your heart. Very strange but the strangeness of the whole first half of the film is what endeared it to me.

And then comes the question that sparks the second half of the film. The bartender asks ""If I could put the man who ruined your life in front of you and guarantee you'd never get caught...would you kill him?""

Quite the question. When it becomes somewhat clear what is happening you become even more engrossed in what's unfolding before you. The question becomes more complicated and I think this is what makes the movie fascinating. The time travel is just part of it but the movie does an excellent job of illustrating how absolutely crazy and difficult time travel makes life. It's something that so many people wish they could do and this movie kind of asks would you still want to if the threads of history and the future would become entirely tangled as a result.

I absolutely love when movies do this. Time travel creates some of the most intriguing paradoxes and this movie does almost everything right.",1422230400,59,1679,4.700680272108843

6866041,5,B00Q8KCS60,"I honestly had no idea what to expect going into this movie. All I really knew was that it was directed by the Spierig Brothers, starred Ethan Hawke and had something to do with time travel. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Based on the short story, ""All You Zombies"" by Robert Heinlein (which I haven't read, but now kind of want to), it follows a Temporal Agent (fancy term for 'time traveler') played by Ethan Hawke who is on his last mission to track down a mass murderer known as ""The Fizzle Bomber."" Part of his cover involves working at a bar, and one night this man comes in and tells him a story. After this, the story takes a number of twists and turns which I won't spoil. In fact, this movie works best if you go in with little to no prior knowledge of what it's about. Suffice it to say, I thought that this was a wholly original take on the time travel paradox that also takes a look at the concept of identity (take that for whatever you want it to mean...). However, none of this would make a difference if the performances weren't also top-notch. Ethan Hawke, Noah Taylor, and most importantly, Sarah Snook, do excellent work here. I also liked how natural and low-tech the sci-fi elements were, which made the concept even more believable.

Personally, I think it's a little more logically consistent than Looper (hey, it's time travel), with excellent acting and a surprisingly intimate little story.  Come into this one expecting to have to follow the plot rather than car chasing (not that there's anything wrong with car chases....it's just not that kind of movie).",1422057600,,506,4.872093023255814

I did wonder if I had picked up a film with a similar name to the time travel one when for the first half of the film we're just hearing the sad story by an angry man in a bar about his childhood when he was a little girl (no that's not a typo). However it actually is a time travel film, although disappointingly it takes the lazy option of clothes and everything else around a violin case time machine also travelling to the past. To say once the movie got going that it was extremely predictable as to what the bigger picture going on is, would be an understatement. It's not a fast paced, action based or comedy based time travel film. If you're after one of those, your best to look elsewhere. This is a slow paced sad tale type of time travel adventure, it is a decent story, but very, very predictable.

Seriously, it is one of the best short Sci-fi stories ever written). I don't want to give anything away because the film is that good (it has a twist which makes M. Night Shyamalan's work seem juvenile), but the story is riveting, the acting is top-notch, and, as odd as the tale is (one must accept that it is set in a parallel universe were we have developed advanced space travel in the 1960s and time travel in the 1980s), it seems logical and believable according to the laws of its environment. Hawke, as always, is an amazing actor (he can bring gravitas to a toothpaste ad), and he has an excellent supporting cast with which to tell this tale. Watch this film by yourself, then read the short story, and then watch it again with a friend and look forward to seeing his/her reaction. Believe me, this is a film to be enjoyed on multiple levels. Quite possibly the best of the year (how did this not make it to the cinema and ""Grown Ups 2"" did? Explain). Don't let this pass you by.",1421625600,2,1224,4.303030303030303

6866088,4,B00Q8KCS60,"""Predestination"" won't be for everyone. If you're expecting an action filled science fiction flick, you'll be disappointed because this focuses more on character and drama. Based on Robert Heinlein's classic seminal time travel short story ""All You Zombies"", ""Predestinaton"" takes some unusul twists and turns. I'm not going to say that you will necessarily be surprised by what occurs (you may figure it out as all the clues are laid out pretty neatly prior to the conclusion)and I'm not going to claim this is a pefect film, but it's entertaining and worth the trip for most folks.

Wait--before jumping to the spoilers below, I would recommend knowing as little as possible on the plot of the film.

MINOR SPOILERS:

Focusing on a time traveler in pursuit of his final elusive target, John (Ethan Hawke)undertakes one final mission to capture a terrorist operating in 1975 New York. John must stop a bombing that will destroy a city block and kill hundreds. Working undercover in a bar in hopes of catching the terrorist based on the clues he has picked up on during previous failed attempts, John encounters a writer with a most unusual story that resonantes with him.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Predestination"" continues to demonstrate that writer-directors Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig continue to prove that they can take genres that appear to be exhausted (the vampire flick ""Daybreakers"" for example which truly is a variation on Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"")and bring some new and interesting twists to genre films. They continue to grow by leaps and bounds in terms of their abilities.

Well plotted and structured, ""Predestination"" focuses on the human elements (much like the previous year's ""Looper"" did although I feel this is a much better structured, smaller film in terms of focus).

The film features two outstanding performances from actresses Sarah Snook and Hawke. The supporting players are, likewise, quite good although this truly is more of a two person dramatic science fiction flick. I would urge those of you considering this film to read spoiler free reviews or as little on the internet as possible about the project to add to your experience.

Unlike most films I review, I watched this on demand and didn't watch a blu-ray or DVD (as of the time of this review but I will definitely pick up the blu-ray as the strong performances make this worthwhile in my humble opinio) so don't have any information on the image quality (beyond the Apple download of the film which had a pleasing HD presentation).

Once I pick up the blu-ray or DVD of this, I will update the review with more information on special features, image and sound quality, etc.

6866103,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Time travel as a central story element is always a tricky thing to weave correctly.  Science aside, the concept alone carries a great potential to take over the story altogether, twisting what could have been into something utterly unrecognizable.  I happy to say that for the first time in a long time, this didn't happen here.

First and foremost, time travel ISN'T explained in this film to any great degree; more like it's kind of glossed over from a broken down description of the cliffsnotes.  So, if you're looking for a some great sci-fi ride that takes the viewer down a ride of in-depth psuedoeducation about paradoxes, casualitiy scenerios, temporal ripples, and other fantastical yet engaging quantum theory subjects you're going to be let down.  However, if you already have a basic to more than basic understanding of such concepts then be prepared to be wowed by a film that finally gets it right.  And finally, if you're a theoretical physics laymen who has the interest in such mind bending concepts to the degree of thoroughly paying attention for an hour and a half then you'll definitely learn something.

Like other reviewers have pointed out prior, Ethan Hawke's performance as the main central character is easily his most impressive performance in ages, if not his whole career.  Granted, I could debate his various roles in the past but needless to the say if there's ever a top 10 or top 5, hell even a top 3 list, this performance would be on it.  The realism and authenticity of the emotion both shown and hidden is just astounding.  Add on top of that, the fact that his character is really second fiddle storywise yet is paramount in driving the story is really just rewarding to watch in such an overlooked genre of film and entertainment.  Unfortunately, this year the Oscars felt sci-fi didn't need any nominations otherwise this most likely would have been on it.

Then you have the Sarah Snook, who as other reviewers have already said, steals the show as the female lead in a role that is sure to be controversial and troll baiting.  Without giving away a vital yet absolutely amazing element to the story, Sarah's character of Jane has to be the most authentic portrayal of a gender dysphoric person ever.  In all honesty, the trials & tribulations her character goes through was as real to life and geniune on every level as possible because of her performance.  Watching her character suffer and press on strong was easily relatiable, believable, and most of felt because of the life she brought the role.  If I didn't know it was a movie I would have truly thought she went through such experiences herself.

And finally all the other characters just fit in perfectly.  None are over shown or emphasized too greatly but instead given just the right amount of presence and power for the story.  The respective actors and actresses portraying them just hit the mark for each role with quite possibly the most exact surgical precision needed to do the overall story justice.  Which in itself is a feat considering the short story it's based on is one of those rare literary works that comes across as an insurmountable feat to bring to film.  Easily in the same category as Naked Lunch or Slaughterhouse Five or Cloud Atlas (yes I'm aware all have been made into films and all said films have failed to match the power of the story they were based on), Predestination achieves the rarity of not failing to translate from it's origin perfectly and respectively.  If Heinlein were still alive, I'm 100% positive he would more than approve of this interpretation of his masterpiece.",1421366400,2,3616,4.789049919484702

6866106,5,B00Q8KCS60,"Predestination is a movie of extravagant genius. The Spierig brothers have taken an impossible short story by Robert Heinlein and made it into an entertaining and mainstream, although complex, sci-fi movie.

There aren't too many movies that will blow your mind, but this film definitely fits into that category. In fact, if you actually give thought to the paradoxes and complexities of this film, your brain may leak out of your ears by the end of it. The amount of rework that the screenplay alone must have had baffles me to no end. Time travel movies are hard enough to create, but to develop a script that's so infinitely complex and yet remains so clear and actually works is spectacular in itself.

It may seem like two movies at first, as most of the first half is about a woman who tells her life story. But she is the crux of the story and her life is important for what's to come. Just a warning, this movie will not leave you feeling happy and giddy, it's a very dark and disturbing thing all the way through.

""Predestination"" keeps you guessing throughout the entire ride, and grabbed my attention instantly even through I thought it started to get weird about 5-10 minutes in, but if you keep watching with a mature mindset I'm sure that all kinds of Sci-Fi fans will appreciate this time-looping story.  I do feel the need to warn people that this film is very confusing even for someone like me who loves time traveling films, so if paradoxes make you dizzy you might not like "" Predestination"", but on the other hand if you're a big time Sci-Fi geek like me I highly recommend Predestination.

6866131,4,B00Q8KCS60,"Directed by the brothers Spierig (Daybreakers), Predestination is a stylish and extremely twisty science-fiction suspense film adapted from the short story ""--All You Zombies--"" by influential mid-20th-century writer Robert A. Heinlein.  It is arduous to describe the film without spoiling its wild and slightly perverse storyline, but it is set in a world of ""temporal agents"" (enforcers who use time travel to stop crimes before they are committed) and set in motion by a late-night conversation between a friendly bartender (a solid Ethan Hawke) and a brooding writer (Sarah Snook), both more complicated than we first imagine.  Presumably produced on a relatively modest budget, this is an attractive and chic film with sumptuous, smartly employed art direction and beguiling dashes of noir mood.  Though set over the course of several decades and presented out of chronological order, the plot is tightly woven. Its satisfying aha moments are reminiscent of a fine episode of The Twilight Zone.  Australian ingnue Snook delivers a gender-bending performance both nuanced and sensitive, and the depth of her turn lends a degree of emotional resonance to what could have just played as a flashy, superficial genre contraption.",1420848000,2,1229,5.4188481675392675
6866132,5,B00Q8KCS60,What a great movie!  I read some of the reviews and almost didn't watch it.  To me it was great and full of suspense with clues as you progress through the film.  If you like science fiction you will like the movie.,1420848000,8,215,4.071428571428571

6866134,1,B00Q8KCS60,"Ugh... feels like they were trying too hard to be clever. This story left me cold. I like the actors. I think everyone involved in making this film did a great job. It just feels like it's trying to be brilliant and what you end up with is a mess - like when you were a kid and mixed ALL the colours in your paintbox.

It tries to be philosophical and fails miserably. And as another person pointed out here, it isn't what scifi fans expect AT ALL.",1420848000,15,448,4.090909090909091
