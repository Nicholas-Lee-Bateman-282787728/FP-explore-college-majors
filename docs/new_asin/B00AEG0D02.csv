5410653,3,B00AEG0D02,"This documentary might have been really good at one time, but it's seriously dated (1994).  There is some nice historical info on how an earthquake in China sparked the modern attempts to try to use seismic data to predict them.  There is also some nice footage of the Alaska quake.",1371772800,,282,4.62
5410654,3,B00AEG0D02,This looks like it would be a good show but the sound is not working.  I have been watching other shows on Amazon today so I know it is not my computer.  I would like to watch this when the sound issue is resolved.,1371427200,,214,3.840909090909091
5410655,5,B00AEG0D02,"This video has a dated look. Most of the people are in 70s-80s era clothing. But that doesn't reduce the enjoyment of the snake information and photography. Wonderful close-ups of fangs and venom extraction! I also enjoyed the section featuring snake-handling groups. It is a very interesting part of our American history.

Special thanks to Amazon for fixing the audio on this program. It worked perfectly following your attention.",1371427200,,432,5.260869565217392

5410663,5,B00AEG0D02,"I had always wondered if ABC's 'World of Discovery' would ever be available on DVD, and was quite excited when I found this one available, which I had never seen. This one follows renowned underwater photographer Alan Giddings (perhaps best known for his work with Great White Sharks) as he attempts to follow the all-but-extinct Blue Whale - the largest animal on Earth - to its breeding grounds off California's coast. While a lot focuses on Giddings himself and the experts with him, there are at least some good shots of these rare and amazing animals. It is worth picking up for anyone interested in these kinds of documentaries.",1444780800,,634,4.825688073394495

5410681,3,B00AEG0D02,"Recorded in 1991 and somewhat dated. The narrator says the filmmaker's full name every single time he's mentioned, which becomes comically noticeable after a handful of times: Al Giddings goes to the Bahamas, Al Giddings built an underwater camera, Al Giddings gets into the water, Al Giddings, Al Giddings, Al Giddings. The music is overdramatic and the narrator tends to say things like ""For reasons unknown, the shark decides to attack"" when it's obvious that the shark is going after the bait tied to the cage/bait line/mannequin/etc. They talk a lot about shark attacks and there are a couple gruesome shots of bite injuries, and they seem to linger on the negative hype instead of focusing on the sharks themselves and the lovely film work. Overall, it's not really a shark documentary, it's an Al Giddings documentary, with some baited, sensationalized shark footage added to make Al Giddings seem cooler than Al Giddings actually is. Skip it and watch Blue Planet or Nat Geo instead.",1410220800,,991,5.012121212121212

5410708,3,B00AEG0D02,"This was pretty interesting. There were neat facts about whales, and some pretty neat footage as well. There wasn't very much information on blue whales though. Most of that is due to the fact that they were still so unknown, but it's hard to make a documentary on something you don't know anything about. It is also almost 20yrs old, so it makes me wonder what we've learned since then. There were some random tangents like segments on great whales or the photographer and his work, but overall, it was an interesting watch.",1376697600,,525,4.655913978494624

5410712,5,B00AEG0D02,"A fantastic narrative about one of the most incredible and colorful wild animals on earth, a Tiger. The documentary also gives us the fanatical and cruel side of humans who lust after Tiger body parts for frivolous reasons. It is truly very, very sad to see the human race degenerate to such inhumane acts, but then again, why should we be surprised. It happens all the time.",1375315200,,375,4.611940298507463

5410714,2,B00AEG0D02,"However it is not for young kids as it is less of a nature show about tigers in nature, and more of an eco-sploitation film detailing the killing and butchering of tigers. It is meant to be graphic and disturbing to slam home the message that they are almost extinct, which can be a problem if you aren't expecting it.
If you want something for the family to watch about tigers living in the wild, try the PBS Nature series.",1374796800,8,424,4.3125
5410715,1,B00AEG0D02,"I will admit.. I watched about the first 5 minutes or so... at that point I cut my losses and stopped the playback. There was no sound... there was no narration... there were just video clips of sharks and boats and sharks near boats and people on boats looking like they could be getting ready to dive with sharks. It was like watching a pasted together string of outtakes from a research boat... an unguided behind the scenes just showing random moments.
Maybe eventually it got better... but I was renting it for my son who was likewise completely unimpressed.
Maybe it was just a playback problem... I tried to run it twice, getting the same silence both times.",1374796800,2,665,4.5966386554621845
