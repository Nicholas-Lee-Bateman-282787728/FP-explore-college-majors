7994653,4,B00009Z56F,"This is a little-known 1930's short that was ""lost in the MGM vault"" until the early '90s. (The alternate title is: The Stolen Jewels.)  It came out in 1931, is a total of 19 minutes in length and of course is in black and white. Many of MGM's biggest stars have cameos in it (including my idol, Joan Crawford, may she rest in peace) all portraying themselves. The film follows the story of Norma Shearer as she goes around looking for her stolen jewels. Some of the performances are silly and others and dramatic, but it's all a lot of fun and a great way to showcase the stars of the ""greatest studio in town."" This is available on multiple DVD sets, or you can also find it online (free of charge) if you do a search. I haven't seen it on TCM yet (I don't think they have the rights to it) but it's worth watching if you can. Remember, you are what you watch.",1205971200,3,862,4.192771084337349
