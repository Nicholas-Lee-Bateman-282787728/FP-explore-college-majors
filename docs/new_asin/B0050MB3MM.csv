These were the only ones I really wanted, but I paid for all four movies which also included Queen of the Damned. Other than the fact I did not receive all I purchased, it was a decent experience.

4515225,5,B0050MB3MM,"I decided to buy this four film favorite of The Lost Boys series. The first film that came out in 1987 was awesome, if not, frightening. The sequels to the first film, are okay, but I think its more geared for a newer generation. Tom Savini doesn't disappoint in the gore department and that's what helps carry one of these Lost Boys sequels. The other films I haven't watched yet so I can't comment on those. I'm more of an old-school vampire film fan than modern over-the-top CG special effects. What carries the films along are the Frog Brothers reuniting in the Lost Boys sequels. I don't like to bash other upstarts who may be in their first or even second film role in this film, but some of the dialog got boring.",1403136000,3,720,4.421052631578948
4515226,5,B0050MB3MM,"Have Queen of Damned on VHS, but DVDs are so much easier to pop in and watch. Love the way she moves, so sad as R.I.P. excellent movie . Always wanted Lost Boys and thought go on get the trilogy--have seen it. Love Keifer Sutherland role and Dont Cry Lil Sister is most awesome song to keep repeating. Diane Weist plays excellent out of touch Mother. 10/10 on this purchase as it arrived early!",1400198400,,394,4.337837837837838

4515228,3,B0050MB3MM,I bought this for the sequels and they are alright but nothing like the original one. Still for the price this is a good set and the video and audio are very good.,1395619200,,163,3.9696969696969697
4515229,4,B0050MB3MM,"Three volumes of the Lost Boys?  I thought there were only two.  Some added plot twists made it interesting in places. Still saddened by Queen of the Damned and the loss of actress Aaliyah (Aaliyah Dana Haughton) just a year before it's release.  Good vampire movie but, well, it's just sad that she really died.",1389225600,,312,4.636363636363637

8451368,5,B0050MB3MM,Can't go wrong with a Lost Boys Compilation disc.  The second and third movie a little cheesy but worth the watch. Queen of the Damned a nice addition to the disc.,1515888000,,163,4.258064516129032

8451373,5,B0050MB3MM,"This is the beginning if the vampire craze that has been going on in films for over 30 years! The Lost Boys started it in the 1980's with the very first movie about a young man who moves to California and finds out very quickly that not all is as it seems. He very soon must fight for his life...and his soul. In The Tribe, a young man and his sister must fight against a group of vampires that are out to convert them both! Who gives in and who doesn't? Find out! In The Thirst, you will recognize some castmembers from the first movie and the action becomes more intense and common. The most recent movie included in this collection has nothing to do with The Lost Boys but is incredible to watch. AAliyah is sexy as heck in this movie and plays the role of an ancient vampiress queen who was one of the originals(just like the CW tv show!). She takes over rather fast and the other vampires must make a rather hasty decision. Obey or possibly die. All of these movies include violence, horror, some comedy although not much, and very sensual scenes showing the lust of a vampire. All of these movies are rated R for those very reasons. Enjoy!",1498262400,2,1145,4.330232558139535
