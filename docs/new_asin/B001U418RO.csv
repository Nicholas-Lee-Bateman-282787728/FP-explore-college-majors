3796657,5,B001U418RO,"I bought this movie a week ago, and have already seen it four times.  What I like about it is that I can go anywhere within my neighborhood, and find these people, especially the three friends Greg, Amiri, and Faybien.

This film is obviously low budget, but it packs a harder punch than some high grossing indy films(Noah's Arc Jumping The Broom) that present gay black men as subject matter.

I have two small complaints with the movie. As I went through the deleted scenes , I saw one in which Amiri and Faybien were dicsussing the possibility of Faybien dating Greg. I  feel that that scene should have been left in the movie ,because I always got the sense that those two characters were right for each other. That is my first complaint. My second one is that I really wanted to know more about Cory. He was in the movie for less than five minutes , but I found him to be far more useful to the movie than Jay who had too many scenes for me.

Overall , I found this movie to be excellent. I hope there is a sequel.",1255996800,2,1019,4.231958762886598
3796658,2,B001U418RO,"I honestly never thought black gay acting could get any worse than ""Noah's Arc..."" I stand corrected.

It was as if the casting call was for:

""Anyone interested in a role in an independent movie
*NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE NECESSARY*
(just come audition ya'll)""

The overall flow from scene to scene was erratic. The writing has a lot of room for growth. & it even seemed as though the whole movie was shot in ONE take...""ya'll better get this scene right the first time, no do-overs.""

But, I give it 2 stars for originality & for being such a bold effort. I could never sit through watching it again but, the writer definitely has potential...I think he just needs a budget.",1255305600,3,673,4.583333333333333

3796660,4,B001U418RO,"After watching FINDING ME, I have to say I pleased with my purchase.  FINDING ME was well put together and I hope there is more coming.  THe acting was ok, the scenery was great.  Some of the imagery was phenomenal.  However, the thing that stood out most in the movies is the music.  I have never been so impressed by the editing of the music and choice of songs.  I'm finding myself looking desperately for songs on this movie.  Anyone know?",1251590400,2,443,4.395061728395062
3796661,2,B001U418RO,"I applaud that there seems to be an effort to fill the void for black gay cinema, but seriously, can't these directors/writes suggest reading the script, rehearsing first, and provide a better quality script?

I honestly don't know people like Fabian in real life, and his constant whining got on my nerves. I thought the standouts were the actors portraying Lonnie, who seemed to be comfortable in his role, as well as Ameera, whose tell-it-like-it-is persona is very reminiscent of a real-life girlfriend.

The lighting was inconsistent. I thought the storyline was going to fall under the weight of the lead actor's overacting/reacting...

Add this to your collection, but it's no The DL Chronicles, The Ski Trip, or Noah's Arc...",1249516800,2,733,5.091666666666667
3796662,4,B001U418RO,"No spoiler here. Great love story about same gender love from an urban perspective. Lots of scenes I can relate to on a very personal level. It made me think back to my 20s. Wow, was I really ever that age?
Kudos to all the creative forces who put this movie together. I like that the very out recording artist, ""Donnie"" has a few songs playing on the soundtrack.",1247788800,3,363,4.27536231884058
3796663,4,B001U418RO,"'Finding Me' is the story of a young man who is trying to figure out and make sense of his life; from getting ahead and making something of himself, his aspirations, the struggle he faces with his sexuality, and standing up to his Caribbean-born father.

Faybien can't seem to get it right, which is amplified ten-fold by his father's expectations because he drops out of school, has a mall job, and looks different...things his father assumes Faybien's deceased mother would not approve of.  Already shy, uncomfortable, and insecure with himself, he relies on the strength of his best friends--Amera, the feisty yet talented singer, and Greg, the bisexual but knowledgeable realist--to get him through.  Faybien is thrown for a loop when he meets Lonnie, who he sees at the bus stop every day on his way to work, and they begin a journey of getting to know each other that sometimes seems impossible because Faybien is always second guessing who they are and having doubts about Lonnie.  When things reach a breaking point between Faybien and his father, Faybien's back is pushed against the wall and he is forced to take a second look at all his relationships, making some powerful decisions in the end.

The strongest acting performances were probably done by the actors portraying the Lonnie and Amera character; the actor portraying Faybien has some work to do in my opinion, which could be because he reveals that he is actually heterosexual in the Special Features interviews, but he pulls through where it counts.  I sort of felt with the DVD cover and reading the back cover that the actor portraying Lonnie was actually the lead Faybien, or how it would make more sense if the roles were reversed and the more masculine actor would be portraying the man struggling with his sexuality, but it actually worked as presented, and will probably open more minds.  I felt the Jay character was a bit over the top and stereotypical, and probably could've been cut out.  Didn't quite understand why the Cory character shows up in some of the photos and on the actual DVD as he was only in the film for less than 5 minutes.  It is apparent that this is a low-budget film by some of the problematic cinematography shots, such as lighting and cuts between scenes, and some of the sets such as offices, clubs, and lounges, but it's easy to get past all of that.

Again, this is yet another gay-themed product where the males have to have nice bodies and be shirtless in the photos that have nothing to do with anything, but I guess that is something that will just never change.  Special Features to the DVD include 3 behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery.

With the commitment, dedication, and love for this project that all involved had, 'Finding Me' is yet another solid and positive Black gay film release.",1245456000,24,2836,4.753564154786151
3796664,3,B001U418RO,"I was so looking forward to the release of this DVD after seeing it advertised.  Have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

The story is good - coming to grips with one's sexuality is always an interesting one - but I felt it went on a little too long.  After awhile, I started to get annoyed with the lead character and wanted to shout ""Grow up already!""  The acting wasn't always the greatest, and sometimes the sound didn't come through at all.

So it could have been better, but it wasn't terrible.  A good effort.",1240617600,9,516,4.378947368421053
3796665,3,B001U418RO,"Enjoyed this work more than I thought I would. (Funny enough, I'm not liking the DVD cover for this - in terms of representing the story, characters, etc. accurately.)

Clothing design and day shots looked very good, while night/dark settings quite poor - how about some lighting OR shooting day for night??

Dialogue filled with many many stock lines, cliches, etc. which yielded lesser characters than we had here. Story structure not all together solid, or coherent.

No idea on acting level/s, all seemed fine to me. The lead may be the best? Direction otherwise seems good, if stretching.

Believe writer-director very much needs to co-write as the story idea and conflicts/drama work rather well. Direction-wise needs to feed his strengths, and cast/crew around his weaknesses. I look forward to the next filmwork.

Glad to hear 2nd lead is working on his own project/s beyond the sequel to this.",1240185600,8,902,5.026845637583893

3796686,1,B001U418RO,"No...just no. This is what happens when someone receives a new camera for Christmas and believes they can make a movie. This film was flawed from beginning to end. Just because the production budget is low doesn't mean the acting has to be so subpar. I could barely find the message behind this travesty due to characters (the main one) just butchering the delivery of scenes. Seriously though, let the kid take some acting classes besides those in his high school drama class and try again.

I'll admit, most shows/movies targeted towards black gay men aren't exactly blockbuster hits (i.e., Noah's Arc), but at least that series got somewhat progressively better. This train wreck should have never been produced. It's so terrible that they've been relegated to making episodes with a camcorder and posting them via YouTube. I suggest searching there and watching as much as you can stomach as opposed to wasting money and time on the film. Definitely do not recommend.",1349481600,,971,4.957055214723926

Whoever gave this more than 1 star must be friends of the actors or also thought that Soul Plane was a great movie as well.

I'm a Noah's Arc fan, and the acting wasn't always the best in that production, but this is something that should have been left in a diary somewhere.  Putting this on film was a big mistake, and whoever did this should have gotten better advice before pursuing an actual production of it.  The acting left much to be desired, the continuity was nonsensical and inconsistent.  The lead character cannot get past anything, and his entire role is entrapped inside of a ball of insecurities, ignorance, stupidity and the most extreme extent of low self-esteem; not to mention laziness and self-loathing.  The female supporting actress has a role that's completely filled with ignorance and screaming.  All she does is yell, she's conceited and throwing adolescent tantrums when she doesn't get her way seems to be a constant throughout the film.  I bought this film because I thought it would be a nice story and anticipated at least decent acting.  Now that I've purchased and seen it, I realize that this entire movie was a mistake and should have never been released.  I cannot even give this film to anyone as a gift because that would be a travesty.  I do not recommend purchasing this film, at all.",1295913600,3,1268,4.797235023041475

But as soon as it finished, my first thought was: why gay themed movies as to be always so depressing? Why when you tell a good love story, with handsome actors and with great chances to be an happily ever after, you have to let it down just at the end?

This would be a good resource for youth development programs.  Very believable, entertaining and sizzlingly sexy story.

But when I think of why I wanted to see the film in the first place and then also learning about what I think was referred to as the `broken shoe-string' budget then the criticism becomes constructive inspiration for improvement when the opportunity arrives.
So minus the critic areas, my feelings are that a great thing was done; a great job was performed and the story was delivered in a fantastic way by all the actors.  They definitely must be proud of the job they have done and the lives and minds they have and will help in individuals ""Finding Me"".
