6071839,4,B00GC6UBPU,Decent movie... didn't know what to expect... kinda like wth in the beginning of the movie but I forgot during that genera time they did these soap opera things.  I was interested throughout the movie was like an American teen movie....,1415664000,,236,4.7560975609756095

6071841,4,B00GC6UBPU,This movie captures very well the unpredictable (and predictable) emotion and experience of young love. I recommend it! Especially if you speak Chinese.,1453680000,,152,5.6521739130434785
6071842,5,B00GC6UBPU,"This was a great movie that tugged at the heart strings. Anyone can relate to at least some of the characters, and it is especially poignant to someone born in that period in china and has similar experience with college during the 90s in China.",1451779200,,245,4.466666666666667
6071843,5,B00GC6UBPU,The beginning of the movie started off hectic and very fast paced. But there are morals and themes hidden in the movie that make it a great movie to watch. You have to watch it all the way through to find out the meaning that the producer was trying to convey to the audience. I think the producer re-thought the ending and decided to delete it at the end and that is why the movie ends abruptly without a perfect ending. I felt like there were 3 minutes left to the real ending that the producer changed their minds on but still overall this was a good movie and I would watch it again. I was just going to give this movie 4 stars because of the abrupt ending but I had to look at the overall picture and this movie was a 5 star movie. It was well-developed and the plot was so perfectly planned and calculated without taking away from the spontaneity of the movie. Awesome movie to watch!,1432252800,,890,4.2105263157894735

6071847,4,B00GC6UBPU,Very good plot.  Only the end could have been better.,1420761600,,53,4.3
6071848,4,B00GC6UBPU,"The first two thirds of the movie are your standard romantic comedy in a college setting, theres unrequited love and betrayals and sweet moments, all of that. But where So Young departs from this formula is in the final third when several years have passed and our original group of women and men have to reconcile their choices in their adult lives with the unfinished business of their young loves, and its very thoughtful because not everyone gets resolution and not everyone gets a happy ending, but our protagonists deal with their feeling and the consequences of their choices. I enjoyed this film very much.",1417478400,4,614,4.857142857142857
8622140,3,B00GC6UBPU,"I saw these movies backwards.  I saw the second first and I have to say I like the second one better than this one.  First off there are too many people in these weird love triangles and it gets overly convoluted.  Who likes who.  Why they like them and then why suddenly they don't like them but maybe they still do.  The movie is very wishy washy.  No conclusive ending.  After watching the second film, the lack of a conclusive ending was no surprise.  Still, the second film leaves no doubt to what the main characters emotional wants are.  Now the positive,  I liked that it showed what life was like in a Chinese university.  Very eye opening.  Actually, that was my favorite part.  I will always appreciate the coin operated laundromats here in the U.S. now.  The whole abortion element of the movie surprised me.  Their views on it are definitely far more laissez faire than what we are used to in the states, but given the one child policy China had so long maybe I should not be surprised.  The whole class division they seem to have in both movies I find interesting.  It seems to suggest that they are theoretically equal but nobody really buys it. So, it was educational.  No time is ever wasted if you learn something.  Therefore, for the average American, I say it is worth seeing.",1506211200,,1296,4.484978540772532

8622142,3,B00GC6UBPU,"The movie incorporates different modes of social commentary into a movie that appears on the surface as your typical movie about youthful college students bonding as friends, chasing their dreams, and falling in love. The efforts to infuse these broader commentaries while appealing to a younger audience's expectations of a rom-com film is becoming a broader trend now it seems, much like with the popular You Are the Apple of My Eye"" and ""Our Times."" All these films convey to the audience that the larger social realities and difficulties of growing up inevitably gets in the way of the more idealistic dreams and hopes that we carry as young adults, which manifests most explicitly as the impossibility of a happy ending for romance. In this particular film, these efforts are often heavy-handed and uneven, leading to a number of inconsistencies in the film. I especially found unconvincing the ways in which the two main leads fall in love with one another. Physical assault (his pushing her), public humiliation (her act of bullying in the cafeteria), and stalking are grounds for cultivating romantic interest for the two? I get that these are common tropes in high school/college rom-coms, particularly in Asia, where minor acts of hostility instead shows and makes way for developing feelings toward one another, but I found this utterly unrealistic in this film. Meanwhile, some of what happens at the end of the film are too overwrought. They seem to scream in the audience's face: ""see?! life is difficult!!"" In this sense, I would say that the other two films mentioned above are superior in this sense. Even so, this film ""So Young"" is unique in setting its focus on the college demographic, which allows it to intimate at other social issues, such as class differences and how they impact the possibilities for social mobility. Overall, the film was a good watch and the performances by the actors were all commendable.",1500163200,,1935,4.993808049535604

8622144,5,B00GC6UBPU,Pretty good romantic story and nice performance.,1486598400,,48,6.0
8622145,3,B00GC6UBPU,"It's okay. I found the pace of the movie too fast and I had trouble understanding each character's personality. The only one has a distinctive and consistent personality is Zheng Wei. I honestly found it boring in the middle of it. I happened to watch ""Our times"" a month ago, and in comparison ""Our times"" is a better movie as it's more in depth in terms of shaping the characters, plus entertaining.",1483142400,,401,4.583333333333333
8622146,4,B00GC6UBPU,Good story line. You have to read the subtitles quick or rewind and pause to finish reading.,1471046400,,92,4.470588235294118
8622147,3,B00GC6UBPU,"I didn't know what to expect, but it was okay. It was definitely deep and reminds us that what we dream as a youth can fade as we grow into adults. Totally realistic and stresses the point of what love means compared to what we think it means. The ending was ironic in a way, bitter sweet, much like the whole film. Not sure if I will watch it again, but I know some of the storyline will carry over and give me something to think about.",1470182400,,437,4.0344827586206895
8622148,4,B00GC6UBPU,"Pretty okay. The story logic was a bit nonsmooth, but the emotion part was touching.",1468886400,,84,4.666666666666667
8622149,5,B00GC6UBPU,"The movie gave a good snapshot of young love during college life in China.  The plot was about first loves, next loves, and maybe finding someone permanently.  The plot had several unexpected twists towards the end which were totally unexpected.  The video was somewhat grainy at times but did not detract from the overall message of the movie.  The only other complaint was the subtitles occasionally went by too fast and I had to back the movie up to see what I had missed on several key moments in the movie.  Overall, the movie was well done and very entertaining.  I thought the movie was well worth the time investment.",1464220800,,625,4.636363636363637
