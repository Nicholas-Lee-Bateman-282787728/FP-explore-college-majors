6273532,1,B00IKM5OWO,"This film is a docudrama about the events that followed the shootout at the OK Corral. It centers exclusively around the Stilwell [sic] family. Doc Holiday (William McNamara) appears 40 minutes into the film. Bart Voitila plays Joseph Cooley the husband of Elizabeth Stilwell (Ashley Hayes) and is portrayed as a modern gun hating liberal. Eric Roberts does his usual beginning and end cameo.

The film is almost all drama, with very little action. There is one killing that we see. Tom Berenger as Judge Wells provides for narration throughout.

This film is brought us by the same group that gave us ""Bonnie and Clyde Justified."" Ashley Hayes played Bonnie in that and used the same accent that made me cringe. Depending on how you felt about that film should determine how you view this one.

8643095,1,B00IKM5OWO,"This was painful to watch. The first seven minutes had me laughing at the lousy dialogue and the actors' wooden over rehearsed recitations. Oh my. I thought I was watching a High School play. But I thought to myself, ""I rented this for 3.99. I might as well keep watching.""  By the 49th minute I could endure no more. It was just too painful, so I turned it off. It was a waste of good coffee money.",1450137600,,399,4.181818181818182

8643099,1,B00IKM5OWO,"This small micro budge video was so over acted, with discount store non-quality echoing sound that it hurt to listen. Why I lasted to the end was just to justify my BARGAIN store price purchase. I will always check Amazon before even buying cheap impulse DVD's. i AM SURE THE 5 ACTORS were hard working and tried, but the script was the main problem. Also, I think they could only rent one horse.",1421798400,2,396,4.438356164383562

 one of the outlaw gang responsible for the
killing of Wyatt Earp's brother, Morgan. Wyatt
tracked him down and killed him. In  this
film Doc Holiday talks him to death. Talk, talk,
 talk, talk, talk is all we get from this film.
Terrible script, just awful..",1419984000,2,302,4.769230769230769
8643101,2,B00IKM5OWO,"""A judge can only go by the facts in hand and then he must use his best judgment."" In 1882 after the shootout at the OK Corral the Clanton gang was not happy with the Earp's or Doc Holliday. Soon after the gunfight Morgan Earp was shot and killed but because of lack of witnesses the killer was never convicted and is free. Not a group to rest Wyatt Earp and his friend Doc Holliday have been canvasing the Tuscon area looking for the killer. Joseph (Voitila) and Elizabeth (Hayes) Cooley are staying at a logging camp when a wounded person shows up at their door. They attempt to help him but when Doc Holliday shows up things begin to change and no one knows who is in the right. There really isn't too much to say about this movie. This is yet another nearly unwatchable cheesy western with awful acting. The main star in this is Tom Berenger. He plays a judge that really has nothing to with the story other then to explain what is going on in a voice over. It may be because I think Tombstone is one of the best movies of all time and it's hard not to compare anybody's portrayal of Doc Holliday to Val Kilmer but this guy was bad. He was only in it for a few minutes though so that helped. This is nothing but a bad western that was really a struggle to get through. Overall, a movie that was really hard to watch and not laugh at. I give this a C-.",1410048000,3,1355,4.136363636363637
