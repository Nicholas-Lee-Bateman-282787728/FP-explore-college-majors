A small boat sails off the Florida coast. They hope to find treasure from lost Spanish galleons wrecked in a hurricane in the 18th century. [This echoes The Maltese Falcon.] Instead the diver finds a naked womans body whose feet are encased in cement! Sharks swim near but are driven away with a knife. The Coast Guard is notified. There is an autopsy. The conversation seems dated. Tony Rome gets a call from a new customer. A huge man asks Rome to find a missing girl. [Farewell, My Lovely?] Rome looks for Sandra Lomax in a bar with dancing girls. The manager says he heard from Sandra that afternoon (after the body was found). Rome goes to a mansion to question a woman. Later he learns about another murder. [Notice the smoking.] Rome goes to a theater to talk to an undercover detective; they talk in private. Later he meets his client. There are surprise visitors, threats, and shooting. Then the police arrive to take them in. [Note the clothing.]

Later Rome visits a painter and sees his model, who takes a break. [Note the familiarity with guns.] There is another death, and Rome is framed for it. Whats next? [Note the automobile brand - product placement.] The police are after Rome, his picture is on TV! There is another chase for action. Rome is wanted for murder! [The missing roommate echoes The Lady in the Lake.] At the end Rome locates Gronski and learns the truth. There is another scene with another confession. Will an inconvenient witness be silenced? [The apple doesnt fall far from the tree.] Will there be a trade? Or will something go wrong? Rome calls Santini in Homicide. [Did the offer of a trade recall The Maltese Falcon?]

This movie is about average. It shows why you need a good story for a good movie; actors alone are not enough. I never read the 1961 book with the same name by Anthony Rome.",1413244800,,1881,4.559171597633136
