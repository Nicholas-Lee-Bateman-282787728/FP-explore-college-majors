8173872,1,B000N1C14E,"I watched short piece of this nonsense on computer and it  was ok so I spent 25 bucks. Mistake. This flick is not really a movie but Lina Romey walking naked, being photographed, having sex and other boring activities. She doesnt look that great and her acting abilities well below zero. It is clear Rolls-Roy was rented for 4 hours and everything else not worth mentioning. But cover art looks great!",1333065600,6,401,4.647887323943662
8173873,4,B000N1C14E,"""Rolls Royce Baby"" is a real tour d'force for 70's Spanish hottie Lina Romay - muse and, ultimately, life partner to Euro sexploitation meister Jess Franco. Unlike many of Franco's fliks that actually feature a plot of sorts this one is pretty much a soft porn extravaganza that showcases Ms Romay to the max.  Beginning with an opening scene of Lina shaving her pubes (racey stuff back in the 70's!) - this sets the tone for the next 90 odd minutes of 'action'. In a bit of a pseudo-documentary mode the film portrays Lina's character as a rich successful sexy model and actress - a couple of scenes show her in the 'studio' during porno photo shoots before she 'makes it' with her photographer.  As the film moves forward she attempts to assuage her sexual hunger by being driven around (naked) by her hunky chauffeur/lover in a vintage Rolls Royce (hence the title!) picking up strangers  and having sex with them. While this film stops (just) short of being fully hardcore (no penetration scenes) it's still pretty explicit with plenty of Franco's trademark crotch shots, lotsa self lovin', and some fellatio pictured. This is one of Romay's earlier flix where she still was fairly fresh & youthful and Lina looks luscious as she takes on all comers! How 'satisfying' this movie will be probably depends on how the viewer feels about the lead actress - if you are a Lina fan then this is pure gold.  The print quality is super sharp - foreign language  w/ English subs, and the only extras are a few trailers for other Franco/Romay efforts.",1310947200,6,1544,4.703703703703703
8173874,4,B000N1C14E,"Lina Romay is an actress who for the love of her art, isn't afraid to do what's right for the part.  Normally, in a movie like this, she'd use another name like Candy Coster.
Basic premise is this.  I'm rich.  I'm bored.  I'm sexually starved.  What do women in this role do?  Well, when self love doesn't do the trick, they go looking for adventure.  Having racey photos of yourself is fine after a little barber work, but let's go get some men.
There is a LOT of self love, plenty of male & female full nudity, simulated sex (like what you'd see on late night cable, only not as pretty production wise), some oral sex-male & female, lesbianism, straight sex (again simualted even tho she does hardcore in other flicks), cruising for hook-ups & cheap sets (apart from the car & the house which you really only see from the outside).  If you're a Lina fan, then of course you need to get this.  If you've seen mentions of her before & are curious, again get this.  It's available in 3 languages (all on the same disc) with some trailers as a bonus.  I'd been looking for this for awhile & finally able to get it.  Glad I did.",1183161600,18,1125,4.304761904761905
