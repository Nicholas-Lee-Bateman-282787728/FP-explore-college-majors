8156439,4,B000KGGNAK,"It was very cool to see Machu Pichu, and Cuzco on video since at one time I had hoped to travel there.  Anthony is very brave eating all the different cultural foods that he tries on his show. Also, I enjoy his quick wit and sence of humor.",1234742400,,240,4.0
8156440,5,B000KGGNAK,"Peru is, if you will forgive the clich, one mind-blowing place. AB's presentation was a great less-than-half-hour postcard presentation of an enormous space, at least as much mental as physical. I appreciate the emphasis it placed on the selva (Amazonia) region, which encompasses over half the country, but is not part of most people's thinking about Peru. As usual for one of AB's programs (but maybe the mix is more extreme here than usual), he approaches the subject with a charming mix of hedonism, curiosity, and respect. Not a likely combination, but it works. I hate to rag on Lima (if only because it has been home for a few years), but my only caveat about this program to someome thinking of making a visit for the first time is that the images of Lima are far more positive than most short-term visitors are likely to know. However, if you are here for a few days, the older Barranca area of town (where, I am pretty sure, the Lima scenes were taken) is worth some efforts to explore. Tourism is very big here and will, economic collapses notwithstanding, only continue to grow. Thinking about it?  I'd do it sooner than later.",1192147200,,1139,4.666666666666667
8156441,5,B000KGGNAK,"Anthony Bourdain is my favorite travel host! He shows the culture and food of the country in a different perspective than other travel hosts. He shows a true love of travel and of the people he meets while recognizing the customs and beliefs of these countries.  The Peru trip was inspiring and fun, leaving me with a desire to travel to Peru and Machu Picchu.",1176336000,,360,4.538461538461538
8156442,5,B000KGGNAK,"Great video.  It showcases cuisine from all the regions in Peru and Anthony Bourdain teamed up with some great people in Peru to really go where the ""tourist"" path doesn't often take you (Gaston Acurio, one of Peru's best chefs if not the best).  A true picture of some areas of Peru, purposefully avoiding some of the newer and more upscale (albeit GREAT) restaurants Lima has and instead going for the old tried and true in Lima (Sonia's) and experiencing truly what people eat in the Andean and jungle regions.  If you ever wonder ""what's typical Peruvian food"" or if you, as a Peruvian are ever asked ""what's typical Peruvian"" (pop this DVD in for them) this is for you.
Also, not to miss are the breathtaking shots of Macchu Picchu, colonial architecture, and overall Peruvian landmarks and scenery.",1171670400,3,804,4.76978417266187
