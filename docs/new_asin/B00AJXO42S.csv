5444704,5,B00AJXO42S,"This latest MST3K DVD set features one episode with show creator Joel Hodgson as host and three with head writer Mike Nelson as host. Three episodes are from the Comedy Central era of the show while the fourth is from the first season on the Sci-Fi Channel. It's quite a good selection of episodes with some movies that are fun and entertaining in their own way even before the riffing starts. Of course, MST3K makes them way more fun.

411- THE MAGIC SWORD
This 1962 color film from Bert I. Gordon is certainly one of his best and it's actually a fairly fun and well made fantasy film aimed at younger audiences. It features a fine cast including Basil Rathbone, Estelle Winwood and Gary Lockwood. Entertaining as it is on its own it still makes for a terrific and hilarious episode of MST3K. In fact the endless fantasy elements and bits of intentional humor in the film work exceedingly and surprisingly well as fodder for jokes on the Satellite Of Love. A beautiful princess (Anne Helm) is kidnapped by an evil wizard (Rathbone) and a young man (Lockwood) raised by a kind sorceress (Winwood) is determined to rescue her. There's even a quite decent looking dragon in the film. The riffing is constant, unending fun during this one and as an added bonus one of the host segments features Crow T. Robot declaring his love for Estelle Winwood in song. There's no better example than this to show that MST3K worked just as well with a decent film as it did making fun of a terrible one. I've been wanting this one on DVD for years and am excited to see it finally get released.

516- ALIEN FROM L.A.
This 1988 Golan Globus color film is a comedy action update loosely based on Jules Verne's Journey To The Center Of The Earth starring Kathy Ireland. However lovely and attractive model Kathy Ireland is the fact that she is not an experienced or trained actress shows clearly in every frame of the film. This of course leads to many wonderful jokes at her expense. The film is quite goofy and in some cases deliberately so, but the low budget production with its silly script can't escape the wrath of the writers at MST3K. The musical host segment ""Wild Irish Ireland"" is charming and extremely funny. There's also a host segment quiz about the many yet few facial expressions of Kathy Ireland in the film that is quite funny. Great riffing throughout.

620- DANGER! DEATH RAY
Poorly made James Bond knock-offs were all the rage in 1967 when this Italian spy flick was released with former Tarzan actor Gordon Scott as agent Bart Fargo (really!) trying to track down a stolen ""death ray"". Oddly, the maker of the death ray declares at the beginning of the film that it was built ""only for peaceful purposes"" which is a good laugh right there for something referred to as a ""death ray"" even before the MST3K writers latch onto it as they do for some great riffing and an entire host segment! Like Secret Agent Super Dragon and Operation Double 007 before it the crew of the Satellite Of Love give us yet another hilarious episode making fun of a terrible attempt to cash in on the James Bond film craze. This is one off the better episodes from MST3K season 6.

803- THE MOLE PEOPLE
Wow, another classic Universal horror picture finally makes it to MST3K DVD release. John Agar stars in this 1956 black-and-white film about a subterranean civilization that enslaves the bug-eyed mole people who share their underground world. This movie was shown endlessly on UHF TV stations back in the 1960s and 1970s and I was thrilled when MST3K had the chance to make fun of it in their first year on the Sci-Fi Channel. MST3K had been referring to this movie from its earliest days with ""mole people"" working for Dr. Forrester in Deep 13 so getting a crack at the actual film must have been quite fun. This episode features MST3K's first guest star ever, NFL player Robert Smith. It's a fun outing as MST3K returns to making fun of its core film genre, low budget science fiction.

Extra features include:
- Bert I. Gordon: The Amazing Colossal Filmmaker, a new interview with ""The Magic Sword"" director Bert I. Gordon by Ballyhoo
- Of Mushrooms and Madmen: Making The Mole People, a documentary by Ballyhoo
- A new interview With ""Alien From L.A."" director Albert Pyun.

5444709,5,B00AJXO42S,"All the MST3K sets from Shout Factory are great, but I like this volume because of the intense diversity of the offerings. The four films selected are all uniquely different and really showcase the varying genres the Mystery Science Theater 3000 cast and crew could operate in.

I was personally most excited to see ""Alien From L.A.,"" the dreadful Golan-Globus production featuring the beautiful but squeaky-voiced non-actress Kathy Ireland in the lead role. By all accounts she is nice and upstanding person, but here she incurs the rapier wit of Mike and the bots due to her somewhat lacking performance. I loved the interview with director Albert Pyun who explained that Kathy's voice was so high that finally they just went with it and added the self-referential voice jokes at the last minute. For people who recall Kathy Ireland as the ultimate glamor model, the transformation from plain to amazing is predictably sappy yet immensely fun. This episode also features one of my favorite host segments concerning Clara Peller in her underpants. Watch for it.

I also loved ""Danger!! Death Ray,"" a cheesy would-be Italian James Bond-esque thriller featuring super spy Bart Fargo (!) as played by Gordon Scott dealing with said death ray and tons of swarthy bad guys in Italian villas. Although the death ray itself is essentially forgotten after about the first ten minutes or so, the riffing is exceptionally strong as poor Bart does his best to make a camp classic into a contender for the Italian cinema. A particular pleasure of this episode for me is the intro in which the crazy genius who built the death ray gives a mind-bending speech about how it's only for peaceful purposes. Sadly, it's the high point of the movie.

""The Mole People"" is a fantastic black and white John Agar vehicle that has been featured in countless jokes on MST3K over the years, many predating running the episode itself. It is a classic of the 1950s monster movie genre, and features outstanding riffing over a silly movie that reminds me fondly of late night UHF television reruns from when I was a kid.

I am not big into fantasy or sword and sandals movies, so while many adore ""The Magic Sword,"" I found it the most tedious in the package. It's funny seeing Basil Rathbone ham it up in this one, though, and the MST writers are sharply on point here, so if you like the loopy fantasy elements on display you will love this episode.

I can't recommend ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: XXVI"" more highly. For either experienced MST3K fans or those new to the concept, it's a great blend of surreal movies and great Midwestern humor. Shout Factory is also to be commended for the extras they included on the set. I especially liked ""Bert I. Gordon: The Amazing Colossal Filmmaker"" and ""Of Mushrooms and Madmen: Making The Mole People.""",1416355200,4,2822,4.810309278350515

5444732,4,B00AJXO42S,"The new set of MST3k is a bit of a mixed bag, but there's still plenty for fans to enjoy.  Here's my breakdown:

THE MAGIC SWORD:  The earliest episode on this set (from season 4) also happens to be one of the best the show's ever done.  It helps that this movie, a fantasy-adventure film from Bert I. Gordon, is honestly pretty good.  Its right up there with ""Diabolik"" and ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"" as being a movie that I'd have no problem enjoying on its own without any irony whatsoever.  The story is a classic adventure story, with knights taking on challenges, fighting monsters, slaying a dragon, and rescuing a princess from an evil wizard.  Its well paced and quite fun.  As with any Bert I. Godron flick, you have his trademark process shots and forced perspective camera angles to make things appear both bigger and smaller than they are.  The fantasy setting and the higher budget both contribute to the effects coming off a bit better than they usually do in his more serious sci-fi flicks.  The casting is great too, with many actual actors, including Basil Rathbone hamming it up wonderfully as the evil wizard.  Joel and Co. really seem to be enjoying themselves on this one too, the riffs are fast, funny and expertly timed.  This is a truly great episode and one that would serve as a perfect introduction to anyone who's never seen MST3k before.

Extras include the trailer for the movie (a fun bonus, I love old trailers) as well as a nice, albiet short, interview with Bert I. Gordon himself.  He doesn't delve too deeply into his film career (unfortunately), but seems like a warm, likable guy who absolutely does love movies.  We may not get much info, but its fun to see the personality behind so many films used on MST.

ALIEN FROM L.A.:  Few things are more painful than unfunny comedies and when a movie deliberately tries really hard to be that ""cult"" kind of weird and fails.  Unfortunately, this terrible, cheap 80's re-hash of ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"" is both things.  Imagine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Bros/dp/B00008979N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Bros.</a>&nbsp;mixed with a super low budget Blade Runner and you're kind of close.  Add in Kathy Ireland's complete inability to act and her horrifyingly high-pitched voice and you have a truly excruciating movie.

She plays Wanda, a nerdy, unadventurous teenager who's mom died in a car accident and who's dad is an explorer.  She gets a letter from Africa (we can tell because the postman delivering it is wearing a pith helmet) telling her that her dad disappeared, so she goes to find him.  Turns out he fell to the bottom of a bottomless pit (no, really) where the lost continent of Atlantis apparently exists.  She falls down too, and finds out that Atlantis is indeed down there, thriving and populated with Australians.  Turns out Atlantis was actually a spaceship that crash landed forever ago and the people down there now live in a somewhat dystopian police state.  Thus Kathy, I mean Wanda, is the ""Alien"" of the title, because she's not Atlantian.  To make a long plot summary hopefully less long, she bumbles around, gets chased by everyone, finds her dad, and an Atlantian scientist lets them use a rocket he built to get them back to the surface.  Yes, a rocket.  They don't *dig* their way to the surface in any fashion, they fly a ROCKET up through the Earth's crust.  This experience gives Kathy, I mean Wanda, the confidence she apparently needs to stop being so whiney and to walk around in a bikini at the end of the movie, which I whole-heartedly believe was the only true guiding factor in even casting Kathy Ireland in the first place (they show the one, rather brief bikini scene like three times in the trailer).

The plot is stupid, and I haven't even began to touch on the horrid script, nonsensical characters, awful jokes, complete lack of emotional build up or character motivation, and cheesy, terrible set pieces this movie contains.  There is not one scene of this film that is fun or enjoyable in any way.  Even people who watch this movie just for Kathy Ireland will be disappointed as through the first half of the movie they've got her in the most unflattering glasses possible, and in the last half a bunch of rags.

In short, this film is excruciating.  Few movies I've seen have actively made me angry as much as this one has (the aforementioned ""Super Mario Bros."" being one of them).  Sadly, while there's plenty of riffing ammo for Mike and the bots, they seem to get bogged down by the films awfulness.  They do okay during the first half, but the more the movie goes on, the riffing becomes more labored and difficult.  I did not enjoy this episode, the movie was one of the worst kinds of ""bad"" and the gang just couldn't save it for me.  I know some people really love this ep, so your experience might be better than mine, but this is the low point of the set, as far as I'm concerned.

Bonus features include the trailer for the film (which manages to explain the plot much clearer than the movie itself) as well as an interview with Albert Pyun, the director of ""Alien From L.A.""  The interview is only about 9 minutes, but boy is it hilarious.  In so many words Pyun basically says that Golan Globus would greenlight anything, that the film was shot in Africa as a way to launder money, and that the location in Africa housed lots of former Nazis.  He's also convinced his movie would be more respected if more people could've seen it in widescreen and if it had access to CGI technology during production.  Seriously, THAT'S what he beileves is holding this steaming pile of crap back from being a good film, WIDESCREEN and CGI!  Albert Pyun, ladies and gentlemen!  A walking example of EVERYTHING WRONG WITH HOLLYWOOD TODAY!  Seriously, a great, weird, funny interview!

DANGER! DEATH RAY:  A James Bond rip-off about generic spy Bart Fargo (no, really!) on the trail of some bad guys who kidnapped a scientist and his death ray, which he made for ""peaceful purposes.""  The movie isn't as fun and loopy as ""Operation Double 007"" but its also not as dreadfully dull as ""Agent For H.A.R.M."" so it falls kinda in the middle of the MST3k spy flicks.  As usual for these types of episodes, the movie's villians are vague, the leads not too charismatic, and lots of stuff happens on coincidence.  The only thing to really set *this* crappy spy flick apart from the others is the weird ""Buh buh duh buh duh buh da DA!"" theme music and the very long machine gun rampage Bart goes on at the climax of the film.  Thankfully, though the movie may not the most memorable, the riffing is very strong from start to finish, and I enjoyed this episode a lot.

Extras include the trailer once again, which, hilariously enough, has no words at all, its just a 3 minute montage of every fist fight and shoot out the film has with some of the movie's music played over it, as well as Mike Nelson's ""Life After MST3k"" interview which was pretty short.  Not that it needed to be longer, he kept contact with most of his collegues and worked with them on a lot of projects after the show, so a lot of it was already covered in other interviews with Bill and Kevin.  Still, he's easy to listen to and grateful for the life he has, so its a nice interview.

THE MOLE PEOPLE:  Another Universal sci-fi flick, this one is not a great movie, but it is iconic, with the memorable Mole monsters showing up in pop culture references over the years (MST3k did plenty of Mole People references themselves, long before using the movie on the show).  John Agar gives an oddly stiff and John Wayne-esque performance (why does this guy so rarely bother to *act* in his movies?  He's great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/when-he-does/dp/B000056NWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">when he does</a>!) as he leads some explorers up a mountain (Rock climbing!) only to fall underground where an ancient civilization exists under the soil.  The ancient race of albinos (descended from Sumerians) worship Istar (through human sacrifice), barely eek out their survival by whipping some mole-ish monsters around til they dig up mushrooms, and are so adverse to light that the explorer's flashlights send them running in fear.

Despite an interesting concept and some potential racial subtext with the albino's slavery of the mole-monsters, this film hardly ever lives up to its potential.  The first act takes forever, as its padded with a weird intro by a scientist trying to convice us of long standing legends of underground civilization (Did audiences of the 50's really need to be convinced in such a manner of a films plausibility?  They bought tickets to a movie called ""The Mole People,"" I'm pretty sure they were okay with the film's concept before the movie even started) along with endless stock footage of mountain climbing.  Even upon discovering the ancient underground civilization, our heros don't ever really DO much, mostly just puttering around til they escape.  It all ends up being pretty standard 50's sci-fi fare, but that's MST3k's bread and butter, so you know they do well with it.  True to form, the riffing is great with several running jokes making for a very fun episode.  The host segments are fun too, I loved Crow's fertility statue.

On the extras you get the movie's trailer as well as a very interesting and in-depth ""making of"" featurette (apparently in the 50's you couldn't have a mixed-race couple survive at the end of your movie, which is why the ""Sumerian"" blonde girl dies at the end of this one).  I like these glimpses into hollywoods past, I'm glad Shout Factory keeps including things like these in their MST3k sets.

So there you have it, one great episode, two strong episodes, and one cringe-worthy film they couldn't quite save.  Add in some really fun extras and its worth the purchase if you're a fan.

That said, I wish Amazon would price these a little lower, $40 is already a little steep, but $50+ is just too much.  I ended up grabbing it new off a certain online auction site because I could easily get it for $40 there.",1367020800,3,10197,4.768660968660969

Disc One; 'Magic Sword', Joel, Kevin & Trace. Color movie.
Likely shows Agnes Morehead from Bewitched. An above average movie by MST. Fun riffs - the gang left Before the credits rolled. Rating 7

Disc Two; 'Alien from L.A.', Mike, Kevin & Trace. Color movie (1980's?)
Stars Kathy Ireland (young). Supposed to take place underground in 'Atlantis' (although they are just under the United States). A crappy movie - the riffs just don't click for me. Rating 2

Disc Three; 'Death Ray', Mike, Kevin & Trace. Color movie.
60's era (attempted) spy movie. If it matters - some great looking women in this one - but the movie was to stupid to enjoy. I smiled and laughed more than once - not great. Bonus - Mike Nelson after MST (Interesting!). Rating 3

Disc Four; 'The Mole people', Mike, Kevin & Bill, Black & White movie (early 50's?). Odd cast with Hugh Beaumont & Alan Napier (Alfred of Batman TV show). Most of this (also) takes place underground. Some slow points - but some really good riffs/moments. Rating 6 3/4

Now that the show's creation lies over two decades in the past, and the pop culture comments up to 50 years in the past, with films at times 80 years in the past, it does take cultural historians to keep these films in perspective. (Especially for those who are discovering these films for perhaps the first time, instead of finding them on saturday afternoon TV back in 1968, or late night cable TV in 1978, etc.) So, I'll comment briefly on each film, and then tell you wants great about those Extras, that often make up for MST3K episodes which are less than classic, or films which are at times better left forgotten.

Episode 802 THE MOLE PEOPLE
They're finally releasing an early Season 8 episode, from when ""Big Mama"" Pearl Forester, Brain Guy, and Bobo take over. Not since the beginning of season 2 has the cast changed so much. Instead of Deep 13, the show shifts to Pearl chasing the Satilite of Love, thru space and time, with a weekly serialized storyline, which became confusing over time. The second SCIFI episode is still setting up how Professor Bobo and Brain Guy joined Pearl, after the previous week discovery of why Crow's voice changed. (Not being able to follow this plot, does little to add or detract from the show's enjoyment. But--best to follow it anyway.) The film this week--A JOHN AGAR FILM!(Shades of Francis Coleman). The MOLE PEOPLE is basically ""Lost Horizon"", but with mole people, and very bleached out ancient Sumerians. SCIFI repeated this episode so often, I know it forward and backward. I always thought it was fun, tho. The 20 minute long documentary on THE MOLE PEOPLE that SHOUT! produced, does much to explain how UNIVERSAL STUDIOS could crank out so many films like this one, LEECH WOMAN, and THE THING THAT COULDNT DIE, on as little as $330,000, using stock fotage, and ""Moviestars"" on salery to the studio. It's always amazing to me, that these films have their true believers in LA, who know everything worth knowing, about the costumes, the sets, and the guys that could create one-take films, without cringing. For students wishing to study the evolution of the USA's entertainment industry, these mini-documentaries provide CRITERION COLLECTION insights into these lowbrow cinematic achievements.

EPISODE 516 ALIEN FROM LA
Even tho the film's from 1986, its a complete disaster. VIDEOHOUND movie guide doesnt even give it one star. But the best MST3K shows often fell on the worst films. Its not that this film lacked for budget, just talent. Casting a fashion model with a voice 5 octaves above soprano, gives the movie a ""nails-on-chalkboard"" irritation that never lets up. (Altho supplies the cast with plenty of riffing material.) A woman's archeologist father falls into a subterranian world, not unlike the MOLE PEOPLE, but in color, and with New Wave Hair. The skits around the film, written by BEST BRAINS still sailing high just weeks after JOEL left the show, keep the episode fun to watch. The extra for this DVD is a LONG extended interview with the mastermind director behind ALIEN FROM LA. Apparently he doesnt realize what a turkey the movie is, and made comments like ""If we could have filmed this today with modern CGI effects, it'd be a hit"" or ""If people could only see the 35mm print of the film, they could appreciate the cinematic composistion of the shots."" REALLY?!?! What was interesting, was hearing how the film was shot in Africa, in an Ex-Nazi community, with production money so diry it was not allowed to leave the country. In other words, someone wanted to do some money launderies, and used this hideous excuse of a film to do it. At the interview's end, the director said he had no intention of ever watching MST3K's treatment of this masterpiece. His loss. One of the most bizarre interviews I've seen on any of these MST3K DVDs, definately.

EPISODE 620 DANGER! DEATH RAY
Altho I'm sure I've seen every episode of MST3K, if only on U-toob, I have no recollection of the film. Even in the MST3K Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, they only devoted a paragraph to this film. However, having such an obscure episode has its own value, ie, it'll be just like watching the show for the first time. Basically the movie's about a scientist who invents a death ray, and while demonstating it, is kidnapped along with the Death Ray, by ""The bad guys"". Unlike the Italian spy films MST3K tackled before, SECRET AGENT SUPER DRAGON, and OPERATION DOUBLE 007, this one has little entertainment value. It's not even CHEESY in a cool way. But the extra here is great: MICHAEL NELSON giving us an overview of his entire career, including his work at CGI FRIDAYs. He talks about how the cast wanted to stay together, like the Rolling Stones I guess, so they became involved in various computer comedy projects when MST3K finally was canceled. For example, there was the short lived LORD OF THE RINGS parody on SCIFI's website. Mike Nelson, like Kevin Murphy, wrote some books reviewing various films. Then later, there's THE FILM CREW, and RIFFTRAX. Mike doesnt give as much behind the scenes insider gossip as Elvis Weinstein and Joel gave in their respective interviews, but he does refer to his effort at attempting to ""Work together"" with the others. (As head writer, he obviously was stepping on toes, and is the main reason Joel left the show.) However, for MST3K fans, its the best of this Boxset's EXTRAS.

EPISODE 411 THE MAGIC SWORD
AHA! The cinematic HIGHLIGHT of this boxset, and Burt I. Gordon's masterpiece, THE MAGIC SWORD is a film which actually has a modicum of quality to it. In fact, this is one of my favorite films they ever riffed on. The MAGIC SWORD is filmed in LSD HORRORVISION, with each frame saturated with bizarre set lighting, creepy humanoid creatures, fractured fairy tale plot logic, and Burt I Gordon's signiture ""special effects"". (Humans 4 inches tall, dragon monster, skeletons, two headed men, and endless process shots.) The plot is simple. A witch (Estelle Winwood) raises a foster son, who when he reaches 20, falls in love with the fair maiden, who's been kidnapped by Baisel Rathbone the evil wizard, to feed to his dragon. But the witch's foster son (Played by 2001 a SPACE ODDESY's Gary Lockwood), who's called GEORGE, slays the dragon, and wins the princess's hand. Sound Familar? Its the story of ST GEORGE. The movie is enough of a treat, but this is season four JOEL, which is MST3K at it's mighty best! Best skit: The INCREDIBLE song that Crow, Tom and Joel sing, after Crow reveals that his love affair with Kim Cattrel is ended, with his affections switched to ESTELLE WINWOOD! And the Extra for this film is fantastic as well. BURT I GORDON in PERSON discusses his career. As it turned out, he started out as a D.I.Y Ed Wood-type amateur with a 16mm camera, and determination. MST3K has done a LOT of Burt I Gordon's films, so it was cool discovering how his oeveur fits together. (His first film was KING DINOSAUR, from episode 210.) Unlike Ed Wood, tho, Burt I Gordon had a bit of talent, and was able to raise more and more money, until he could afford to film MAGIC SWORD in color, with some real movie stars. And what impressed me most, was the genuine love of cinema, for all types of cinema, that came across from Mr. Gordon. This is one extra you DEFINATELY will want to watch. And, like all these films, the movie trailer is included, the artwork mini posters, along with ""Mystery Science Theater Hour"" wraps for MAGIC SWORD.

And there you are...another fun box set of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. Apparently the box set will be released in December 2013, and will have a Burt I Gordon film with a ""giant Insent"". (Probibly Episode 313 EARTH VS THE SPIDER). Let's hope that SHOUT! keeps releasing these boxsets, for those of us who find as much artistic revelation about the human condistion in ROBOT MONSTER, as is in Tarkovsky's STALKER. Well, ALMOST as much.",1365033600,10,8373,4.795706371191136

5444742,4,B00AJXO42S,"For the 26th installment of the cult classic show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", Shout Factory has given us the fans 4 more episodes from Seasons 4, 5, 6 and the opening Sci-Fi era season 8.

-Episode 411, ""Magic Sword"": Here we have famed and cannon fodder ridden director Bert I. Gordon whose films have been riffed on this show in the past seasons (""King Dinosaur"", ""The Amazing Colossal Man"", ""War of the Colossal Beast"", ""Earth Vs. The Spider""), a few episodes came ""Tormented"", Season 5 gave us ""Begining of the End"". All of his films were usually made very cheap and a lot of them featured oversized monsters, cheap sets and were generally cheaply made all around.

This offering is called ""Magic Sword"" which takes some goofy medival theme cliches and makes a story featuring a princess, wizardry, a young man who must become a hero and save the princess from harm and bring peace to the kingdom. Since this is aimed at kids obviously, it's a fairly breezy and at times childish and the main monster featured is a fairly decent looking dragon. For a Joel episode its pretty decent, whimsy and goes by pretty quickly, the riffs are good for the most part, so it's worth a look.

-Episode 516, ""Alien From L.A."": Here Kathy Ireland is the daughter of an archaeologist who goes deep below the Earth's surface to find him and finds a race of sub creatures who believe there world is the only one. Sound a bit like ""Journey To The Center of The Earth""? Well it basically is and it's one bad flick, the whole underground city theme is just cheesy as you know what, the effects are terrible, the story just bad and Kathy while very attractive is a terrible actress. Mike and the bots do a good job here as this junk is perfect material for them.

-Episode 620, ""Danger! Death Ray"": Of course a death ray would only be used for peaceful purposes so the maker of it surely didn't need to tell the viewers that. This is one of the many, many James Bond knock offs that Italy and other European countries did in an attempt to cash in on the huge success of the Bond flicks. Also the main actor is a former ""Tarzan"" who plays an agent named Bart Fargo and the silliness and goofiness of this Bond knock off is entertaining enough by itself. Mike and the bots do a good job with this one.

-Episode 803, ""The Mole People"": John Agar (""Revenge of the Creature"") finds a lost civilization in the Earth that has enslaved a race of mole people to do their bidding. There's the expected cheap sets, ""action"" scenes, romance, the mole people and their captors are just laughably cheap and silly looking. It's pretty bad, bland and is perfect stuff for the MST3K crew. It's easily one of my favorites as they just get more vicious with their riffs as the movie goes on.

Bonus Features

-Interview with ""Magic Sword"" director Bert I. Gordon: Not a bad interview, but fairly short, he at least seems gracious in how he has achieved fame in filmmaking.

-Interview with ""Alien From L.A."" director Albert Pyun, pretty good piece here but short one. He does tell some good stories about how the production of the movie was difficult and how working with Kathy Ireland was interesting to say the least.

-Life After MST3K, Mike Nelson: We hear from the man who took over for Joel Hodgson in Season 5 as the lead on MST3K. Good stuff here as Mike is one of my favorites from the show.

-Of Mushroom and Madmen-Making The Mole People: Good stuff here too, very cool piece that shows how the movie was made very cheaply.

-Also including theatrical trailers and MST Hour Wraps.

8552841,5,B00AJXO42S,"Opinions vary widely as to the quality and ""riffability"" of the four movies sent up in this compilation volume XXVI.

They are:  THE MAGIC SWORD, Episode 411.  A Bert I. Gordon production (1962) with first-rate special effects, and probably the most successful movie of the four upon initial release.  Technically pitched at kids though there's a fair amount of hot-cha in this story about a lovesick wannabe knight (Gary Lockwood) in search of his love despite the predations of a rival (Liam Sullivan) and an evil sorcerer (Basil Rathbone).  Estelle Winwood is a hoot as the adoptive mother, whom Crow falls in love with during one of the host segments and sings a song to, about how she's ""rooty-toot-toot"" and ""smells like Juicy Fruit.""  A good solid Joel-and-bots episode, though really the movie can stand on its own.

ALIEN FROM L.A., Episode 516 - I for one just can't get beyond supermodel Kathy Ireland's voice.  Some people say she had a ""little girl's voice"" but I disagree.  Marilyn Monroe used a ""little girl's"" voice.  Ireland sounds like a cartoon mouse.  Other than that, it's a decent enough mash-up of dystopian, high-tech, and Atlantis themes - all so VERY 1988!  Plenty of opportunity for the SOL crew to lampoon the outrageous hair and clothing styles, Aussie accents and Ireland's squeaky earnestness.  Many people consider this a favorite episode.

DANGER! DEATH RAY, Episode 620.  A silly and potentially annoying Spanish-Italian James Bond ripoff from the height of that era (1967).  Mike and the bots get fine lampooning out of the cardboard characters, pervasive sex scenes and hails of bullets.  In fact, I'd say it's a good example of a movie redeemed by their riffing.  You couldn't pay me to see it if not for them.

And finally, THE MOLE PEOPLE, Episode 803.  This 1958 archaeological fantasy was hardly Universal's finest hour among monster and sci-fi flicks, but you have to admire the tenacity in sticking to its ludicrous premise. John Agar, Hugh Beaumont and others stumble onto an underground lair that has held an intact Sumerian civilization, still functioning after 3,000 years.  A great riff session for things-that-look-like-things:  dozens of boxes at the expedition's staging site are called ""Free government cheese!"" - other equipment came from ""Sam's Club of Asia.""  Maybe it's a guilty pleasure, but I enjoyed the movie and the heckling both.

Even though most people aren't going to fall in love with all four source movies, and despite the fact none of the episodes has a short-subject included, I'll still give this one five stars -- and the current price is right.",1491436800,2,2617,4.990762124711316

8552844,5,B00AJXO42S,"I am a huge fan of Mystery Science Theater, and one of my favorite episodes back in the day was Alien From L.A., starring Kathy Ireland. They tear the movie apart (rightfully so!), and it is absolutely hilarious. That was my main reason for purchasing this set. The film is just so bad, with Kathy's shrill voice being very painful to listen to. However, the MST gang rip it appropriately!

Danger, Death Ray is also a very fun time! I like the 60's vibe of the film already, but it isn't a good flick by any means. So, the jokes the gang provides really makes this one a good time!

I was impressed by certain scenes in the Magic Sword, with them having some fun (but cheesy) special effects for the budget they had. The gang does a great job riffing on it as well. The picture quality isn't the best in some parts of the film, which is standard for Mystery Science Theater since they worked with the prints they could get, so it didn't hurt anything in my opinion. In fact, it sometimes adds to my enjoyment of it!

I haven't viewed the Mole People in this box set yet. However, I did watch it back when MST3K was airing on my local cable channel in the early 90s, and remember it being decent. But, as I mentioned, Alien From L.A. is why I purchased this set, and it made it worth every penny for me!
