8216329,3,B000EMSM72,"Hmm...here is another Jesus movie from Mexico.  ""El Martir del Calvario"" (The Martyr of Calvary) is older than ""Jesus, Nuestros Senor"" and dates back to the early 50s.  The film itself is black and white and runs for approximately 2 hours.  A short movie on such an expansive subject as the life of Christ can be tricky for any director.  Oddly enough, this peice can be looked at in two parts: the first hour and the second hour.  Alright, the first half of this movie is weak.  It opens with Jesus gathering four disciples (John, James, Andrew, and Peter) at the Sea of Galilee.  This segment seems to be the film's only on-location scene as the rest of the movie is studio-bound.  The action moves very quickly, and there is really no sense of travelling about; the events are contained to a few static sets.  Early on, Jesus heals a paraplegic in the middle of the street.  This event is witnessed by both Judas and Matthew and they join on as disciples.  From this point on, Judas becomes the only disciple that matters.  He has most of the dialogue and constantly stands at Christ's side.  For whatever reason, Judas is depicted as the young, handsome, brash zealot type and aside from the earring in his right ear, he actually looks the part of a 1950s hero!!!  Anyway, Jesus proceeds to heal Peter's mother of fever.  He also gives the Sermon on the Mount and this location serves as the place where he heals the centurion's servant and also where he feeds the five thousand.  Now, Jesus does return to his home town - another studio-bound set - and meets up with his mother, Mary.  At this point, the film's Catholic agenda rears its head as we see Mary dressed in a perfect 20th century nun outfit!!!  Jesus runs into trouble with the locals despite healing a blind boy right in front of them and parts from the crowd with some kind of supernatural stare down.  Christ then meets the Samaritan woman at the well and it is here, on the Samarian set, that Martha comes to Jesus and tells him of Lazarus's illness!!!
  Okay, before I can proceed onto the Mary of Magdelene segment, it is important that we put Enrique Rambal's depiction of Christ into perspective.  First off, he is a failed attempt at ""living room Jesus"".  He is not handsome, but he is pancaked with make-up and powder and he has bushy, flowing hair with crimping on the sides.  He also dresses in huge white robes that distort his thin frame.  He stands out like a sore thumb against the other characters; kind of like ""Who's that freaky guy?"".  When he speaks, he talks in some quasi-Shakespearian fashion and seems always to be talking to the air above his head in hushed whispers and with eyes bulging under big false brows.  Sometimes, in moments of extreme overacting, a spotlight halos around his head to enhance the Catholic postcard imagery.  So, imagine our surprise looking through Mary Magdelene's eyes as this creepy, artificial Jesus moves closer and closer to the camera.  Truly I tell you, he looks more like Bela Lugosi's Dracula than ever Jesus!!!  Okay, on the positive side, Rambal's Christ is divine...and that's more than can be said of some lesser films on Christ's life.  He performs miracles and good deeds throughout the movie including raising Lazarus from the dead, healing the sick in Jerusalem, and saving the adulteress from being stoned.  As mentioned above, most of the ""offbeat"" stuff occurs in the first hour of the film.
  Now, something big happens during the second half of this movie; it actually becomes effective!!!  It features better sets; it has more action; and even Enrique Rambal becomes more convincing in both his confrontational scenes and in his emotional scenes.  We see him ride into Jerusalem on a donkey; we see him trash the temple; we see him confront the Pharisees; and we see him teach at the Last Supper.  The Garden of Gethsemane scene that follows is pretty standard fare for the era; Enrique Rambal does have a sad, weepy face and does use a pleading voice in his prayer, but falls far short of Christ's pain as described in the Book of Luke.  His performance, like many others, is just too forced.  Okay, the trial scene!!!  This is first rate stuff!!!  Jesus is worn and tired; his hair is matted and his clothes are dirty.  He no longer looks like the effeminate weirdo of the first hour; he no longer looks like he just exited a beauty salon.  If he would have looked this way through the whole movie everything about him would have been far more convincing.  Jesus and his disciples traveled in deserts and dusty towns and in the hot sun on a regular basis!!!  Jesus was not afraid of ""hands on"" work and nor was he afraid of getting dirty.  It was actually refreshing to see this Christ look more gritty...and more human.  Anyway, whether Christ is standing before Pharisees or Pilate, the trial sequences work well.  We don't learn much about the motives of this Pilate, but he he certainly is a roughneck.  He is loud and has a stern demeanor and seems really annoyed by the proceedings.  His feelings toward the plight of Jesus seem neutral at best.  An effective set makes this scene all the more interesting.  Christ is whipped and beaten in graphic detail; this uncensored violence seems to be a staple of ""Mexican Jesus"" movies even as early as 1952!!!  The American counterparts of the same period always downplay or skip over these emotional yet realistic events.
  Jesus' agonizing walk down the Via del la Rosa is also first rate.  Rambal's battered Christ struggles with his huge wooden cross while being whipped by both Roman and Jewish soldiers. Simon of Cyrene is present to help him out.  Unfortunately, this emotional rendition is marred momentarily when a woman wipes the blood from Christ's face; the resulting image on the cloth is a perfect artist's portrait of Rambal's mug!!!  This is amazingly laughable in the midst of such a serious situation and should have never gotten past the cutting room floor.  In any case, Rambal turns in a solid performance as the suffering Christ both on his death march and on the cross.  Upon his death the sky darkens, the wind howls and an earthquake shakes the ground.  The roof of the temple then collapses and a hanging Judas sways in the tumultuous winds.  What a great artistic touch!!!  In this film it is Christ himself who rolls back the stone and catches the Roman soldiers by surprise.  He emerges covered in a bright aura and ascends into Heaven.  All things considered, this is certainly not the worst film on the life of Christ, but by the same token, this is not the best place to start.  I'll give one star to the first half of the movie and four stars for parts of the second and an all around feel of three stars total.",1242950400,2,6739,4.636824324324325
