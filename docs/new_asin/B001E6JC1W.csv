It's a little bit too expensive for me at this time, so I haven't tried to purchase it, but I will when I get my income tax return. I've rated the third season with five stars, because I'm rating the excellent series and not the skinflints that are offering it by piecemeal.

3546172,1,B001E6JC1W,"Gunsmoke - The Third Season, Volume 1 continues the release schedule for one of television's alltime greatest television series. Beloved and revered, this series will always be considered one of the alltime best. Yes, because of its' longevity, but also because of the great acting, directing, and writing displayed on the series.

But still, I cannot recommend these sets. There is no excuse, no justification the studio can make for splitting a 20-season series up and dividing each season into multiple sets. It's greed, shortsighted, fear of producing full season sets that won't sell - maybe one or more or all of these things. But the Western lover, loyal as we are to our favorite stars, our favorite movies and series, are being made to pay a price that is way too high to pay. To think how long it may be before the entire series is released is too painful. Suffice it to say that it will be WAY TOO LONG at the current rate.

At this point, it is probably too much to expect the studio to come to its senses. But it is worth it to say that they need to come to their senses, and soon.",1222560000,79,1094,4.465

Any insight/feedback regarding the company DVD Media Star and their product listing (or any of their DVD listings for that matter) for the Complete Gunsmoke Collection would be welcome. Supposedly all 20 seasons/635 uncut episodes are available on 99 DVDs for $187.95.

3546175,5,B001E6JC1W,"Gunsmoke is a great classic tv show, especially the first nine seasons that have the late Dennis Weaver on the show. I do wish that the seasons would be released as whole seasons and more faster, but you have to remember something: Gunsmoke was first aired in 1955, that is almost 54 years ago. These early seasons of Gunsmoke first have to be found, then remastered all before they can be released on DVD. So naturally with a show this old and a show that ran for so long, it's going to take time to get the seasons out onto DVD, as for the seasons being split season DVD's, who knows how long it would take for them to release Gunsmoke onto DVD if they took the time to find all, remaster all the shows of a single season and then release it onto DVD. My advice is don't complain, be glad that a great Legendary Show like Gunsmoke is being released onto DVD even if it's just split seasons. I personally am glad take them as they are released.
For those intrested, Gunsmoke Season 3: Vol 1 will be a 3 disc set that contains 19 remastered episodes that are:
1. Crack up
2. Gun For Chester
3. Blood Money
4. Kitty's Outlaw
5. Potato Road
6. Jesse
7. Mavis McCloud
8. Born to Hang
9. Romeo
10. Never Pester Chester
11. Fingured
12. How To Kill A Woman
13. Cows and Cribs
14. Doc's Reward
15. Kitty Lost
16. Twelfth Night
17. Joe Phy
18. Buffalo Man
19. Kitty Caught",1220400000,25,1365,4.213740458015267
3546176,5,B001E6JC1W,"The first eleven seasons (those in black and white) are so much better than the color episodes we're all so familiar with (if that is possible).  They are tight, believable stories; well-written; edgy; and authentic (Milburn Stone's family members were pioneers in Kansas, so he made sure the show was honest).  John Meston wrote most of the early ones, and they are amazing to see.  I would love it if these episodes were televised, but they are longer than our current shows (the 30 minute shows average 26-27 minutes), so it's not likely unless on a cable channel with few commercials.  Do not fear that you will buy inferior TV...these episodes will not disappoint.",1219449600,8,669,4.842105263157895

I love Gunsmoke and Rawhide, 2 classic shows and I am just glad to get the opportunity to obtain superb prints of these wonderful shows. I wish there were more extras, I wish the releases were more frequent, but I will just gladly accept what i can get. A superb show with beautiful quality episodes to watch at the flick of a switch. A dream come true and as long as it lasts I am there to wallow in it. Happy trails to all fellow fans.",1219276800,23,615,4.090909090909091

3546195,5,B001E6JC1W,"This is one of the better seasons for this long running series; James Arness and Dennis Weaver receive nominations for best actor awards.
The show wins best an award for best dramatic series and two shows are nominated for individual awards.
This is the number one TV show for the season, well written with excellent acting and as good now as in the 1950s.
This is 1950s TV, small screen, black and white, just as it was presented at the time.

Marketing splits the season into two packages, the reason for most of the one-star reviews.
Each set is about nine hours with some of the old commercials as an extra.
Gunsmoke always had excellent actors; part of the enjoyment is playing Whos that?",1473552000,3,693,4.588709677419355

3546207,5,B001E6JC1W,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,2,883,4.966216216216216

3546262,4,B001E6JC1W,"Now, the series is good and dandy, but the only real problem I have is some of the laws they enforce. I just finished watching the episode called ""Potato Road."" It was alright. What I don't get is throughout the series, if a woman points a gun at Dillon, try to kill him by shooting, the Marshal turns the other cheek and don't arrest her?? Just because her husband and son got killed and he feels sorry for her?? She was just as ruthless and evil as them! And how many times is Chester and Matt going to get fooled by somebody? So far, I've seen Chester, guarding a prisoner, with his back turned (Chester is not that stupid is he?? Fool me once, twice, three, four, but it doesn't stop!), he gets clubbed on his head! Another one, where the criminal said the horse was standing on his foot and Chester without thinking, just runs over to the guy, put his gun away, gets taken over AND the gun, and Chester becomes the prisoner! There's another episode where these guys almost killed Chester, but because he didn't die, they get let go and FREE! Are you kidding me?? Attempted murder and they're free?? So I'm wondering, did the writers do a lot of research and found out that the law back in the western time was this lame?? I guess so because it's repeated so many times throughout the run. Still, other than that, it's still a GREAT series and I can't get enough of Dillon, Chester, and the gang!",1415923200,,1400,4.367816091954023

3546336,5,B001E6JC1W,"Maybe I'm showing my age,but for my money the half-hour, black and white format early years of Gunsmoke beats most of today's TV fare. They are gritty the way westerns should be, but without the over-the-top violence of modern TV. The acting of this cast is old- school superb.  James Arness was a flawless actor.  Many of the old TV western actors were stiff and contrived.  He was awesome.  And check out the interaction between Doc (Milburn Stone) and Chester (Dennis Weaver).  Those two guys had true genius that not many people appreciated.  When Gunsmoke switched to a one-hour color format it became more of a ""Little House on the Prairie"" style soap opera and I didn't like it.

James Arness, may he rest in peace, was excellent playing the fast-shooting, fast-talking Marshal.  Chester Good, Miss Kitty, and Doc Adams added many elements to this episode.  The episodes in this third season are excellent!  I cannot say enough...",1350777600,,446,4.972972972972973

3546352,5,B001E6JC1W,"Arrived early and in great condition.  Would be happy to buy again from this seller.  I've purchased seasons 1 through 5 and Vol. 1 of Season 6.  Many other reviews comment on CBS splitting the seasons into Vol. 1 & Vol. 2, of course this is to boost profits.  So with regret I will have to slow down on purchasing future seasons due to the cost.",1349136000,,346,4.196969696969697

throughly enjoyed it.  We refuse to believe it was that long ago we first saw it.  Would recommend this to any Western fan. All the stories were great to watch. Thank-you Amazon.com",1308182400,,389,4.6911764705882355

I subscribe to a satelite tv network with hundreds of channels and still want more of these Gunsmoke dvds. By the way James Arness is still alive and well in the Minneapolis Minnesota area close to where I reside,I find that exciting. I am also looking foward to the Gunsmoke 4th season to be released soon. Thankyou",1283731200,,439,4.5

If you love Gunsmoke you will love to collect the whole series without a doubt.",1249084800,2,306,5.019607843137255
3546403,5,B001E6JC1W,This has to be the all time classic for a TV western.  Its 20 year run speaks volumes for the magnitude of this series.  I take this to be the standard for all westerns ever produced for TV.  The stories were all well written and acted out with a super guest star each week.  The main cast of characters were well chosen for their roles.  To me James Arness is Matt Dillon and can not be replaced by any other actor.  In 1986 I had the honor of being cast for a character role in Gunsmoke:Return to Dodge.  I had a blast working with the cast and production crew and that in itself spoke volumes as to why the series ran for 20 years.,1240531200,2,634,4.064516129032258
3546404,4,B001E6JC1W,"The split season product for the 30 minute episodes is miserable. I bought every one of the half-hour episodes that Columbia House would sell (dozens of 4 episode tapes at $25 each) but that was the only deal available... and the series' were terrific! It amazes me that they are taking so much time to crank these out... because at this pace, the base of consumers is going to be dead before they even start selling season 7! Ought to buy a new hand calculator for those bozos! We all know that the big consumers are going to reside in that segment of the population that was alive in the 50s and 60s. And the sellers are running out the clock? Like we're going to put a buy order in our WILLS!??? There are times when you see things like this in corporate bureaucrats and you wonder why someone doesn't come up with a new sitcom about them called ""Brainless.""",1240185600,4,861,4.3875
3546405,5,B001E6JC1W,"I am so glad to finally see Gunsmoke being released on DVD.  I too, think that they should release full seasons, or at least release the split seasons a little faster.  However, I am happy to see it released at all!
These DVD's are great quality.  It is wonderful that the younger generations are finally able to see all of the Gunsmoke episodes, which were originally aired before I was born -so they are all new and a treat for me!",1239926400,,433,4.320987654320987
3546406,5,B001E6JC1W,"Gunsmoke was a favorite TV show in the ""50's"" Dad on the couch and me on the floor. Very clear and great audio. Couldn't be more pleased. My husband and I now settle in for a night with Marshal Dillon and the gang. Can't wait for the next installment.",1235174400,2,251,4.142857142857143
3546407,5,B001E6JC1W,"I dislike the two volume format particularly for a half hour show, because there are so few hours of content in each volume (with a volume of Rawhide we get twice as many hours as in a volume of Gunsmoke). That said, the episodes are excellent. CBS, please release seasons 4-6 of Have Gun Will Travel on the same schedule as seasons 4-6 of Gunsmoke.",1232409600,2,349,4.384615384615385

3546409,5,B001E6JC1W,"CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""GUNSMOKE: THE THIRD SEASON VOL. ONE""  (14 September 1957- 18 January 1958) (500 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- The television series ran from September 10, 1955 to March 31, 1975 on CBS for 635 episodes --- Until 2005, it was the longest run of any scripted primetime series with continuing characters in American primetime television --- According to a James Arness interview, John Wayne was offered the role, but wouldn't do it; Wayne was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, and at that time, working in television was seen as a huge step down in prestige for a star actor.

In the end, the primary roles were all recast, with James Arness taking on the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon upon the recommendation of John Wayne, who also introduced the first episode of the series; Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode; Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. Galen ""Doc"" Adams and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell, owner of the Long Branch Saloon --- Norman MacDonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. John Meston was named head writer --- Arness, in his role on Gunsmoke, achieved what no other actor at the time had ever matched: he played the same character on the same scripted series for 20 years - at the time the longest uninterrupted period a primetime actor had played the same role in the same show.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
