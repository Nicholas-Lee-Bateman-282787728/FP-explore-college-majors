1083191,3,6305836736,"This is another great opera from the San Carlo Opera in Naples.  Overall, it is a fine operatic experience.  Lauren Flanigan as Abigaille is wonderful.  The bass who sings Zachariah is terrific, with a deep and full  voice.  Renato Bruson, who sings Nabucco, is unfortunately a little past  his prime, and shouts and wavers on high notes.  But he is a great artist,  and gives a moving theatrical performance.  In general, the sets and  costumes look a little amateurish, and I kept thinking that this was a long  cry from the Met in all the little details.  Worse, the sound is heavily  compressed, to the point that in pauses, the hiss cuts off suddenly, as if  a limiter was used.  I really think the producers have a little to learn  about miking the performers properly, as there was great variation in  volume, depending on where they were standing.  Met videos get this right.  Overall, though, I enjoyed this dvd quite a bit.",960249600,12,933,4.648148148148148

7896337,4,6305836736,"The opera Nabucco is a milestone for Giuseppe Verdi. It was his first hit musical, composed after the death of his son and wife. Symbol of resistance I believe the North of Italy by Austria and certainly stop him and his editor who had a future as a composer. Musically it is a joy to see in opera maturity. But it has the characteristics of genius, especially in the issue coral.
The Scala in Milan is distinguished by the conservatism of their productions. Often up styles is overstated. The Nabucco they agreed more than wrong. Scenarios representing the Babylonian period, light and mingle with appropriate costumes sometimes heavy demai.
Renato Bruson is a baritone with an international reputation. He sang in all the major opera houses of the world, including Brazil. His technique combined with enviable colorful notes made it a central focus in Verdian roles as Falstaff, Macbeth and Nabucco. Interpretation was never his mark, but then it becomes Nabucco. It shows an excellent actor. It incorporates all the feelings and emotions of the character. Your pipeline is strong in the first act, destroys without the slightest compassion the temple of the Jews. The loss of power to the adopted daughter makes him lose lucidity, is troubled, enigmatic, lost. A true Nabucco, voice and interpretation.
Ghena Dimitrova is without doubt one of the greatest sopranos of the late twentieth century. Her Amneris alongside Luciano Pavarotti at La Scala is unforgettable. In this opera has the responsibility for giving life to Abigail. It does this with great skill, surely one of the greatest interpreters of this character. His dark and powerful voice suits the requirements of the score. His performance is flawless scenic, cold, Machiavellian and ruthless to achieve their goals. These are some characteristics of the temperament of that character and very well expressed on stage by Dimitrova. Mais an outstanding performance.
The orchestra of La Scala is unsurpassed when it comes to Verdi. His Italian musicality, combined with a perfect technique and a proper balance in all suits gives us a unique sound. Example for all other orchestras in the world when it comes to Italian opera. The conductor Riccardo Muti's more than proven competence, you know make the most of its orchestra. Movements correct and full knowledge of the score only increase the quality of their interpretations.
A central factor for the successful development of the opera Nabucco is the chorus. Participates actively in all the acts and presents the best-known part of the score, Penseroso Go! Enslaved, humiliated and hopeful, and represent the chorus of La Scala. They sing and act very well, with a unique style. Many of them with the level of soloist. Accompanying the choir bass Paata Burchuladze plays the role of Zachary, leader of the Jews. Deep voice, dark and serious generous. Lend deity your character. Defends his people tooth and nail, makeup and costume perfect.
The image of the dvd is of good quality, nothing exceptional in the case of an analog matrix. The sound is of good quality. You can choose scenes, menu practical and easy to use.
The reader must be wondering why the title? Two versions, two ways. The other way is a dark shot Nabucco in Naples. Hard to imagine how a theater of international fame can go wrong both in a production. Soloists weaknesses of the mountains, Maurizio Fruzoni, Carlo Colombo, and Lauren Flanigan with voices are inadequate. Sometimes ocher, the often opaque. The only one that saves Renato Bruson is still not in their best days. Sings without much inspiration, nothing compared to the Nabucco at La Scala. The governing Paolo Carignani remember a band from the inside. Dull and reading at least one wrong or strange in the score.
The highlights were the sets and costumes, modern, light and beautiful. The choristers are another positive factor, can sing well, even with the intricacies of the soloists. The direction of television errs in many outlets, it shows the essence of the story. Sound and image of that terrible qualidade. Voc like Verdi, who enjoys opera, run this version.
Dvd of Naples is overwhelming evidence that to make good opera soloists need is qualified. It's no good to hit the production and sin in singers, even the papers ""minor"" should be given special attention. We have seen many operas with excellent soloists and bad comprimrios. The merits are with the Scala of Milan, was right on all counts and did a great job. The San Carlo in Nabucco was more confusion than answers.

DUAS VERSES, DOIS CAMINHOS.

 A pera Nabucco  um marco para Giuseppe Verdi. Foi seu primeiro sucesso musical, composta aps a morte de seu filho e esposa. Smbolo da resistncia do julgo do Norte da Itlia pela ustria e a certeza pare ele e seu editor que tinha futuro como compositor. Musicalmente no  um primor como veremos em peras da maturidade. Mas j apresenta caractersticas de genialidade, principalmente no quesito coral.
  O Scala de Milo se notabiliza pelo conservadorismo de suas produes. Muitas vezes at peca pelo exagero. No Nabucco eles acertaram mais que erraram. Cenrios representativos do perodo babilnico, leves e adequados se misturam com figurinos s vezes pesados demai.
  Renato Bruson  um bartono de reputao internacional. Cantou em todos os grandes teatros lricos do mundo, inclusive no Brasil. Sua tcnica invejvel aliada ao colorido das notas centrais fez dele um destaque nos papis verdianos como Falstaff, Macbeth e no Nabucco.  Interpretao nunca foi sua marca, mas nesse Nabucco ele se transforma. Mostra-se um excelente ator. Incorpora todos os sentimentos e emoes do personagem. Seu Nabucco  forte no primeiro ato, destri sem a menor compaixo o templo dos judeus. A perca do poder para a filha adotiva faz ele perder a lucidez, fica conturbado, enigmtico, perdido. Um verdadeiro Nabucco, na voz e na interpretao.
  Ghena Dimitrova  sem dvida um dos maiores sopranos do final do sculo XX. Sua Amneris ao lado de Luciano Pavarotti no Scala  inesquecvel. Nessa pera tem a funo de dar vida a Abigail. O faz com maestria, com certeza uma das maiores interpretes desse personagem. Sua voz escura e potente se adapta as exigncias da partitura. Sua atuao cnica  impecvel, fria, maquiavlica e sem escrpulos para atingir seus objetivos. Essas so algumas caractersticas do temperamento dessa personagem e muito bem expressas no palco por Dimitrova. Mais uma atuao marcante.
  A orquestra do Scala  insupervel em se tratando de Verdi. Sua musicalidade italiana, aliada a uma tcnica perfeita e um conjunto equilibrado em todos os naipes nos proporciona um som nico. Exemplo para todas as outras orquestras do mundo em se tratando de pera italiana. O regente Riccardo Muti de competncia mais que comprovada, sabe tirar o mximo de sua orquestra. Andamentos corretos e pleno conhecimento da partitura s fazem aumentar a qualidade de suas interpretaes.
  Fator fundamental para o bom desenvolvimento da pera Nabucco  o coro. Participa intensamente de todos os atos e apresenta a parte mais conhecida da partitura, V Pensero! Escravizados, humilhados e esperanosos, assim representam os coristas do Scala. Cantam e atuam muito bem, com um estilo nico. Muitos deles com nvel de solista. Acompanhando o coro o baixo Paata Burchuladze interpreta o papel de Zacarias, lder dos judeus. Voz profunda, escura e com graves generosos. Empresta divindade ao seu personagem. Defende seu povo com unhas e dentes, maquiagem e figurino perfeitos.
  A imagem do dvd  de boa qualidade, nada excepcional por se tratar de uma matriz analgica. O som  de boa qualidade.  possvel escolher cenas, menu prtico e fcil de usar.
  O leitor deve estar se perguntando o por qu do ttulo? Duas verses , dois caminhos. O outro caminho  um tenebroso Nabucco filmado em Napoli. Difcil imaginar como um teatro de fama internacional consegue errar tanto em uma produo. Solistas fracos tem aos montes, Maurizio Fruzoni, Carlo Colombara e Lauren Flanigan esto com vozes inadequadas . As vezes ocres, as vezes opacas. O nico que se salva  Renato Bruson , mesmo assim no est em seus melhores dias. Canta sem muita inspirao, nada comparado ao Nabucco do Scala. A regncia de Paolo Carignani lembra uma banda do interior . Sem brilho e com uma leitura no mnimo equivocada, ou estranha da partitura .
  Os destaques ficam com os cenrios e figurinos, modernos , leves e bonitos. Os coristas so outro fator positivo, conseguem cantar bem, mesmo com as trapalhadas dos solistas. A direo de televiso erra em muitas tomadas, no mostra o essencial da histria. Som e imagem de pssima qualidade. Voc que gosta de Verdi, que aprecia pera, fuja dessa verso.
  O dvd de Napoli  a prova contundente que para fazer boa pera  preciso de solistas gabaritados. No adianta acertar na produo e pecar nos cantores, mesmo os papis ""menores"" devem merecer ateno especial. J vimos muitas peras com excelentes solistas e pssimos comprimrios. Os mritos ficam com  o Scala de Milo , acertou em todos os quesitos e fez um excelente trabalho. O San Carlo nesse Nabucco mostrou mais equvocos que acertos.

7896338,5,6305836736,"Firstly, to the reviewers who don't get Verdi singing, perhaps a brush up-course may be in order. Lauren Flanigan, as Abigaille, gives the best vocal performance available on dvd or video. Only the divine Maria Callas does it better(and that is only available on a fair sounding cd). Madame Flanigan respects every note and marking Giuseppe Verdi indicates in the score. Her voice is in superb shape here, and her legato, coloratura, and all the other extremely difficult things that a true Verdi soprano must execute are present. Neither Dimitrova, Neves, nor the outlandish performance of Guleghina come close to this.

Bruson was a superb Nabucco, in his prime. He still has the fire here and a good part of the vocal requirements, but age and wear has begun to take its toll in this performance. Still, he is very much in command.

Visually and sonically this is a very fine example of this opera. The sets are stunning, as are the costumes and blocking. The orchestral components are adequate, but it could be wished that the conductor could have pulled a bit more ferocity from the memebers at certain critical moments.

7896339,4,6305836736,"The people reviewing this version of Nabucco need to see the whole thing. The first act does have some sound muffling but acts 2,3,4 for some reason do have DVD quality sound. After seeing this I am reminded of Verdi's Macbeth which premiered six years after Nabucco. If you like Nabucco, see Macbeth, (the Sinopoli version available here on Amazon). There are a number of performances of Nabucco in the Teatro de San Carlo, one of which is with Maria Callas from 1949, a monural recording but spectacular performance.",1077062400,,518,4.831460674157303
7896340,5,6305836736,"I have watched this opera three times and like it better with each showing. I also have two other VHS recordings of Nabucco and think this one at least holds its own among them. True, the fellow who plays Zachariah isn't Sam Ramey, but he still does a very respectable job. Maybe I am just a hick from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, but I liked the opera. The chorus deserves recognition-- it was superior. Maybe those who didn't like it just don't care for Nabucco.",1043193600,7,473,4.386363636363637
7896341,1,6305836736,"This has proved to be a very disappointing recording. The production is spectacular, but, the recorded sound quality is very sub-standard - that is poor.
Again Image is running true to form, the packaging contains virtually no imformation, no synopsis of the story, no date of production, no comprehensive list of the cast or any material relating to the cast.
all in all a very poor DVD of what should be a most spectacular event. why is there no effort to convert the sould from stero to 5.1 which maks a significant improvement. Many European productions do this most successfully.",1030060800,10,584,4.85
7896342,2,6305836736,"What a pity this DVD is so amateurish! NABUCCO is one of Verdi's best early operas and is all too rarely performed today. Bruson's performance of the title role, while no match for Gobbi, is quite good - from what we can tell but the sound is so poor it sounds like the producers used one microphone hidden at some odd location. The camera work shows no evidence of rehearsal or forethought. Aside from Bruson and Flanagan, the rest of the cast was mediocre and were certainly nothing to waste a video on.",969580800,16,505,4.440860215053763
7896343,2,6305836736,"The sound on this dvd is not too bad for the voices, but the orchestral balance is weird, the trouble is we buy dvd as apposed to vhs hopefully for superior sound, but not in this case.",961459200,11,185,4.027027027027027
7896344,3,6305836736,"Just said all with my title. The production is one of the most spectacular I can remember, but the sound is really ugly. It's a real pity! This is not the average quality of DVD I want to see!",960422400,14,192,3.948717948717949
7896345,4,6305836736,"In Nabucco the singing is more important than the opera, in the sense that the many hits don't add up to a cohesive musical-dramatic entity. The tension is in the challenges to the singers and chorus. Verdi experiments  here with every possible writing form for voices  - there is even an  a-cappella piece for the chorus - ""Immenso Jeovha"".
The singers in this  production provide the focused suspense associated with the vocal  requirements of the major roles.
Lauren Flanigan, is a marvel at the  New York City Opera in the modern repertory, where she recently did Susan  B. Anthony, in Virgil Thomson's ""Mother of Us All"". Flanigan's  Abigaille is unusually complicated for a straightforward bitchy character.  She creates Abigaille as a tormented woman whose vindictiveness stems from  the depths of her anguish, and as such the character arouses some sympathy.  Vocally her dramatic coloratura (a bit on the light side for the Verdi  roles she is doing) has a lot of presence and a fabulous technique, but  there is something more here than just the sum total of some technical  accomplishments. I think it's the total commitment and concentration that  is contagious, and is the hallmark of a great artist. Her immersion in the  role is so total that she becomes breathless at the end of ""Salgo gia del  trono aurato"" but this momentary loss of vocal control is part of the  sport-event-like drama that this opera is, where the singers/athletes push  themselves to their physical limits.
Renato Bruson was the greatest  baritone of the 80's.  Nabucco is one of his signature roles, but I prefer  Cappuccilli's more refined and nuanced approach. Bruson is a great stylist  and his big voice is still in good shape, but the close up element of the  recording brings out the dark colors of the voice. He attempts little  subtlety or shading (other than in his confrontational duets with Flanigan)  and delivers the declamations rather fiercely. After the first response of  pleasure at the volume and intensity of the voice fades away it comes  across as loud and strained.
 The chorus is up to the challenge, but  other than Flanigan's and Bruson's contributions, the production seems to  drag on somewhat routinely as far as the audience is concerned. There  should be more excitement in the air, and the audience seems relatively  indifferent for a Mediterranean audience attending a performance of  Nabucco. This may have to do with the conductor's inability to bring out  the fire in the work. The final applause dies before he even has a chance  to come on stage.
The picture quality is excellent, and the wide screen  format is quite dramatic. There are some interesting camera angles, for  example from the top side boxes, that on the wide screen give an unusual  view of the stage. Some camera takes are inspired, like recording the  singer in the background between two choir members in the foreground.  Surprisingly though, the audio balance is a bit unstable as the singers  move or turn their head and on some scenes it has an unnatural boxy  acoustic on the stage (the orchestra pit acoustics is fine). The singers  occasionally sound close and with no aura around the voice - this problem  comes and goes and I couldn't fathom what it relates to. Occasionally the  singers disappear momentarily out of focus, particularly when they retreat  to the back of the stage.
Despite these minor complaints I can't have  enough of this DVD. Repeat viewing reveals many fine details of vocal  technique, best sampled out of the dramatic context, since there is no  context, but rather a parade of vocal pyrotechnics.",960249600,15,3625,4.920529801324503
