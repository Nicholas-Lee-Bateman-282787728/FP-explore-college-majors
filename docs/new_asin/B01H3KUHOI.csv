7776371,5,B01H3KUHOI,One of the finest shows ever produced!!,1477958400,,39,4.714285714285714
7776372,5,B01H3KUHOI,"These 22 episodes represent the final leg of the 116-episode journey that has taken suburban boy Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) from junior high (middle school) in the late 1960s to a 17-year-old young man awaiting his senior year of high school in 1973.  But that is measuring only by age and school year when what is most important is the wealth of life experience already acquired that he will be able to look back on - including a serious first love - which has enabled him to develop self-knowledge and self-confidence, an attitude of determination, and an independent spirit.  We have little doubt that he is now sufficiently equipped to handle senior year, college, and the challenges beyond.  It is no wonder (so to speak)  that the series wrapped up on Independence Day.

There was some talk about the show continuing for one more season, but executive producer/writer Bob Brush realized it was about time to bring it to a close when Kevin's voice got lower than adult Kevin's (in the form of narrator Daniel Stern).  The ""wonder years"" of adolescence were essentially over, and he was afraid of ""jumping the shark"" (a ""Happy Days"" reference) if they were to keep going.  [This information comes from the indispensable in-depth (55-minute) bonus-feature interview with the extremely articulate Mr. Brush.]

As it stands, I don't think the series in its entire run had more than just a few minor missteps.  Certainly one area that never dipped below 100% in authenticity and effectiveness was the acting of Fred Savage in what would seem to have been one of the most demanding roles in episodic TV history.  He was the focus of nearly every scene, and everything was seen through his eyes and his reactions.  Brush noted that whenever a Kevin line flopped in rehearsal it invariably meant that it was poorly written, as Fred never missed as the voice of his character.

Besides the brilliant aforementioned ""Independence Day"" finale (which, incidentally, featured older sister Karen's [Olivia d'Abo] only appearance of the season), excellent, memorable episodes abound.  Just to name a couple:

1) ""Homecoming"" does what only ""The Wonder Years"" could do so naturally and eloquently: mix believable comical situations with realistic drama.  In this case, the craziness surrounding a homecoming football game (including a series of childish pranks involving the opposing team mascots) is contrasted with the homecoming of Wayne's (Jason Hervey) pal David ""Wart"" Wartshafter (Scott Menville) after his first combat tour in Vietnam.  The young soldier is seriously conflicted, and one can never forget his heart-rending line after he impulsively shed his old civilian clothing: ""Nothing seems to fit anymore.""

2) ""Eclipse"" - in which the writers took a real event from 1973, a total eclipse of the sun [they moved its date up three months], and spun it into comedy gold: a hilarious school field trip romp to the planetarium chaperoned by nerdy science teacher, Mr. Plenitzer. (Tim Stack nails it comedically, as does Gregor Hesse as a thrill-crazed student on a mission with a major cherry bomb.)

In multiple-episode secondary roles, acting honors go to Andrew Mark Berman as Kevin's jumpy and twitchy comrade Chuck Coleman, as well as to Lindsay Sloane as Chuck's cute but hyper-emotional girlfriend, Alice Pedermier.  Also, five years before ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Giovanni Ribisi makes an impact as Kevin's new pal Jeff Billings, a wry wisecracker with personal issues; as does the lovely Paula Marshall, as Bonnie, the divorced-with-child Norcom co-worker whom five-years-younger Wayne unwisely falls head-over-heels for.

In memorable single-episode guest roles (besides those already mentioned), James Tolkan is very convincing as the tough-as-nails wrestling coach who wants to find out what Kevin is made of; and Renee Humphrey is charming and courageous as the classy, self-aware new girl in school with a Cyrano nose.  And nineties hit network TV series fans will no doubt catch in small parts Jerry Seinfeld's TV dad Barney Martin (as old Kevin Arnold) and future Emmy winner Gordon Clapp (""NYPD Blue""'s Detective Greg Medavoy) as a Richard Nixon campaign manager.

The music on the show continued to be excellent, and the pop records used were well chosen to provide their own form of relevant commentary.  Percy Sledge's ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" returns from Season One, providing a poignant bit of romantic symmetry.
[One musical anachronism: Joe Cocker's version of ""You Are So Beautiful"" appears two years ahead of its actual 1975 chart run; but then it's the perfect song for the moment, and it offers a change from his ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" the show's Beatles-cover theme song heard on every episode from the beginning of the series.]

The DVD comes with a colorful, informative twenty-page booklet containing episode summaries and a number of highlighted features of further interest.

7776377,5,B01H3KUHOI,"Originally telecast in  1992-3, this is the final season of The Wonder Years. Apparently the show was cancelled after the sixth season for a number of reasons, some of which were:

1) Conflict between producers and executives at ABC. As Kevin matured, the producers wanted the storylines to mature as well. However, the executives at ABC felt uncomfortable with more explicit content given the time slot.
2) The cast's salary increases, coupled with location shooting  led to Bob Brush (executive producer, interviewed in the bonus features) claiming that they were spending $1.2 million an episode.  Because the cast and crew were unsure at the time of filming if the sixth season was going to be the last, he was forced to have the final episode ending to be open-ended

8764554,4,B01H3KUHOI,"Appearing on both The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stones Best TV Shows of All Time lists, The Wonder Years is certainly one of the most memorable shows of the late eighties.  Premiering After the Super Bowl on January 31st 1988, It was an immediate hit as baby boomers could not get enough of the blossoming junior high school relationship between Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) and Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) in the 1960s.

There were certainly many other relationships explored on the Wonder Years featuring an amazing array of talented performers; but ultimately the show always came back to Kevin and Winnie.  As mentioned in the bonus material found on the DVD release of Season Six from Time Life, which hit shelves on September 27th; You rarely marry your childhood sweetheart.  This was a factor in making Season Six the last of the series as the characters we had come to know and love were growing up, getting ready to graduate high school, and ultimately moving on.
Yes, there could have been more seasons of The Wonder Years, but not without a new direction and ultimately a change to the innocence of the show.  After all; this was the seventies.

Sadly season six contains some of the weakest episodes of the series.  Knowing that the end was near and no significant changes were to be made; the writers seem to be biding their time so as to poor everything into the ending. They were successful as the final episode is one of the most poignant and emotional of the series.  Before we got to the finale, we do have to travel down some roads that don't seem to go anywhere as well as some that seem very familiar.

Season Six opened on September 23rd, 1992 with Homecoming featuring a potentially powerful tale of Waynes (Jason Hervey) best friend Wart (Scott Menville) returning from Vietnam.  This is the first sign that season six would be one filled dancing around the proverbial line.  Though there are a few powerful scenes, too much time is spent at the start of the episode catching us up on where we left off, and a side story about Kevin stealing the mascot of a rival team.  Like most of the season; we don't get enough of what we want.

Episode two features Jack (Dan Lauria) taking the boys on a fishing trip.  The episode tries too hard to make a point and leaves us wanting a subplot. Sex and Economics is reminiscent of a Happy Days episode though it does feature a guest appearance by Seth Green.  Hulk Arnold is a little too similar to Kevin going out for baseball in season three, while Poker and Kevin Delivers seem like filler as neither episodewelldelivers.
There are many episodes where we see elements of the relationship between Kevin and Winnie, but its not until the end that we see real growth.  In the case of the rest of the characters; watching Jack leave Norcom, and purchase his own furniture business, Wayne start dating a woman with a child, Paul (Josh Saviano) exert his independence from Kevin, and the addition of Giovanni Ribisi to the cast as one who brings a nice balance to Kevins circle of friends, are truly the best parts of season six.  Still, we are left with some questions; such as why was Wayne absent throughout the storyline of Jack leaving Norcom?  Wayne was working there at the time so the decision would seem to have impacted him.

As always; the music is great and the season six release has some of the best bonus material of the series including an enlightening interview with Executive Producer Bob Brush.

Recommendation: Ultimately season six is all about the finale, and the cast and crew deliver wonderfully. Its worth buying the season just to see how the story of these Wonder Years comes to a close.  Have box of Kleenex at the ready.",1488153600,,3718,4.645801526717557
