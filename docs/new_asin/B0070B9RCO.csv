5046024,3,B0070B9RCO,"I used to watch this show and loved it at the time.  Looking at it now, after all these years, it's actually quite funny.  It's funny how the years have changed my opinion of it.  It's all black and white.  I thought it would be in color.",1356566400,,238,4.0
5046025,5,B0070B9RCO,Really enjoyed seeing the episodes again.  The aged look of the series enhances the experience.  Glad I now have an early piece of Dark Shadows.,1352246400,,144,4.72
5046026,5,B0070B9RCO,"This was so great to watch.  If you are a fan of the old series and remember watching it in the late 1960's you will really enjoy watching these again.  I was a big fan but until the Johnny Depp movie release I had forgotten about it.  After watching the movie, which was entertaining for new fans but did not do the old show justice...I really wanted to see some original shows.  My library had one set of these DVDs and I watched those.  After that I was hooked.  This collection has 40 episodes of the original shows with no commercials.  You end up watching one after the other and because of the way they end with a cliff hanger...you have to watch the next one!  Soon hours have passed by and you are hopelessly addicted. I have purchased 2 collections now and need to buy the next one.  They are a good value, $22.50 for 40 shows!  Plus, they can be quite scary in places.  There are also comic moments when the actors forget their lines and they didn't cut out the mistakes.  If you were a fan of this original show, you will love this collection.  Start with the collection that introduces Barnabas! That is collection 1. Then watch this one.",1349481600,,1151,4.347417840375587
5046027,3,B0070B9RCO,I love the series but I assumed Collection 2 would pick up were Collection 1 left off. It did not. It would be helpful if the episodes were listed on the description so I could get them in order.,1349136000,5,195,4.0256410256410255

""Dark Shadows"" is something else altogether, for those with a taste for vintage gothic/horror. ""Dark Shadows,"" celebrates distinct, goofy, macabre elements. It's a subversive phenomenon, a wonderfully campy, gothic epic, not a ""soap."" Rather, the series delves in a darkness flavored by film director Val Lewton's artistic sensibilities. ""Dark Shadows"" has a proclivity for Celtic darkness; after all, the Celts invented Samhain/Halloween, and gave us the Irish writer Bram Stoker, of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/0393970124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>, as well as Scotland's Robert Louis Stevenson, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strange-Case-of-Dr-Jekyll-and-Mr-Hyde/dp/0486266885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a>, who inspired later DS plots. Perhaps DS's creator Dan Curtis was of that particular strain of Irish/Scottish heritage that favors long, dark nights enriched by spooky tales. Noir film director Fritz Lang was also an avid fan, having worked with the marvelous Joan Bennett; Dan Curtis was inspired in ""Dark Shadows"" by Lang's film, starring Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Beyond-the-Door/dp/B0089LT800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Beyond the Door</a>. I highly recommend Joan Bennett's other film noir masterpieces, such as the captivating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reckless-Moment/dp/B004A30AW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reckless Moment</a>, where James Mason falls for his victim. Mason's Irish blackmailer is the inspiration for the less romantic, odious Jason McGuire, who arrives at the manor, showing that human horror in ""Dark Shadows"" almost worse than the supernatural. Dennis Patrick is just too convincingly good as one of the most awful human monsters to enter Collinsport.

This Collection also contains fun interviews with actors Nancy Barrett, Alexandra Moltke, and Dennis Patrick; Dan Curtis is also featured. Molkte recounts how one ABC producer visited the DS set and thought it was a mess, cobwebs and all, and that it needed to be disposed of; he didn't understand that he was just seeing The Old House!

The pressure is on for poor matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Bennett), being forced into a marriage by Jason Maguire, while her daughter Carolyn (the remarkably talented Nancy Barrett) runs amuck with Bud. The inimitable Vampire Barnabas (Jonathan Frid) does his first good deed, rescuing his desperate cousin Elizabeth from, ""A place where those sought refuge from the torments of life."" Thus begins his bumpy road to redemption, and relentless clutch on fans. He walks between worlds, past and present, life and death, declaring, ""Death is the most fascinating and unknown prospect man has . . . no one has clearly defined death."" A huge denouement fast approaches, one we've been waiting for since the beginning of the ""Beginning Collection,"" prior to this collection. Elizabeth hilariously informs the sheriff, while expressively wringing her hands, that he won't need more deputies to handle her, she won't be ""any trouble."" And Barnabas has a chance to do his second good deed, when the consuming greed of Jason McGuire propels him to a shocking discovery. Enjoy!

Thankfully, Maggie Evans (superbly played by Kathryn Leigh Scott, a stand-out) makes her escape from Barnabas, with the aid of a little-girl spook named Sarah. In the Blue Whale Bar, with a groovy jukebox bleating relentlessly, Maggie reappears, much to everyone's shock. Time for another beer. Enter, Grayson Hall as Dr. Julia Hoffman, that inimitable, scenery-chewing, chain-smoking raven of a woman. She won a well-deserved Oscar for her marvelous role in the masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-of-the-Iguana/dp/B000EBD9TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night of the Iguana</a>. One can only appreciate her contribution (and dry humor) to ""Dark Shadows."" In hulking Collinwood manor, tutor Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke is perfection) becomes entranced with Josette's music box. Burke Devlin (now, ably played by Anthony George) woos her; he's the only person in Collinsport to begin suspecting Barnabas.

Why is ""Dark Shadows"" so relaxing? Perhaps it's that the denizens of the murky environs of Collinsport, Maine, aren't concerned with the normal things in life, even when they discover missing cows drained of blood. The narrative envelopes and captivates viewers in a coastal fog, unique to Collinsport. You may need to stock up on groceries before embarking on your epic DS journey. An inexorable spell is cast, you may find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over, unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport. Warning: after hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Don't worry, just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and find comfort in that this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again. Robert Cobert's superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Soundtrack/dp/B000L43P4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;sets the mood for this delicious, languorous plunge into darkness.

The entire cast of this little horror troupe is theater at its best; they deserve credit for a remarkable achievement that proudly stands the test of time.

5046031,5,B0070B9RCO,"I've been squinting and attempting to watch Dark Shadows on Netflix for the past couple of weeks. I thought the show was just normally really dark because of its age. Whenever you catch it by chance on the chiller channel its also very dark. To my amazement, this DVD set has extraordinary quality. Everything seems to be remastered and wow, it makes such a huge difference. The detail of the rooms in the houses is completely amazing, everything is lightened up which brings out all the great detail! This is a super nice set. I am sure all of the collection sections are just as good. I have ordered several now and have not watched them all yet, but my first impression of Dark Shadows on DVD from this collection is that it is just great and I am enjoying it so much more compared to Netflix or TV.

This set begins as Maggie is still being held captive by Barnabus who has tried to turn her into his long lost Josette. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is planning to marry the conniving Jason and her daughter, Carolyn is totally not happy with that arrangement because she smells a rat, so she is going off the deep end by becoming engaged to a biker named Buzz who begins to hang around Collinwood. Things progress from there and get really dicey. Maggie, who is being kept in the dungeon is seeing the ghost of a little girl from the past as she tries to figure out a way out of the dungeon in the old house. Willie as usual, is trying to keep the peace and keep everyone out of harms way. There are lots of great twists and turns throughout-some of them even Shocking!

If you are a Dark Shadows fan and have a renewed interest in watching the show with the new Dark Shadows in the theaters, or if you are a new fan, this remastered version is first rate and makes watching the show a delight. With the clarity and great picture, you can watch for all the little goodies that make this show so refreshing and fun to watch compared with all the high tech perfection on TV today. This is good stuff and really fun to watch and it's still Spooky. Naturally, Barnabus is fabulous along with the rest of the cast.

Netflix is okay to check it out with, but it also shows a very limited selection of episodes from each season. The DVD sets are the way to go. My Mom also loves Dark Shadows and we are each buying some of the disc sets and then sharing them.

Each disc has 10 episodes so there are a total of 40 remastered shows for each collection set. In this set, Julia Hoffman also arrives and pretends to be an historian while she takes a gander around Collinwood to see if she can glean any clues regarding Maggie's disappearance. They've really done a good job revamping these old episodes and I am enjoying them a lot. The discs also contain interesting interviews that tell about the history of the show and of filming it back in the day. It's interesting to hear the actors reminisce about the show. From what I gather from most of the interviews - Willie was a hoot.",1338163200,36,2968,4.351985559566787

So enjoyed this series when it first was aired on ABC, poor  guilt ridden Barnabas, I had empathy for him, I never thought I would have had any empathy for any vampire, enter Jonathan Frid with his grand protrayl of Barnbas, he made one have sympathy for this tourted soul Barnbas Collins, the vampire who felt great guilt and shame for the wicked things he did to others to keep him the living creature of the night, when you think about Jonathan Frid was masterfull, to create this feeling with a audenice of sympathy for this cursed soul, cant think of another actor who could of done that at that time in the 1960's. I think on so many levels this show speaks to so many issues within a human being, I find this series most thought provoking and I love it in black and white, with all the flubs,  such as forgetting lines, sets falling over and etc..

Dark Shadows is the ancestor to shows like Buffy and Angel, Supernatural, and a host of other comtemporary programs. It was one of a handful of sci fi programs of the 1960's to play it straight and proved that science fiction can be more than the b-movie fare of the 1950s.

Collection 2 has an easy to understand episode guide with interviews at the end of every disc. Its also easy to advance through the end credits to get to the next episodes. The stories are gripping and pull you in. The subject matter more than makes up for the production mistakes.

5046065,4,B0070B9RCO,"Dark Shadows Collection 2 contains 40 episodes from the summer of 1967, when the show was entering its second year on the air. During much of the first year the show's ratings were low and it did not appear likely it would survive, but in the fall of 1966 the producers decided to shift the show, which had been conceived as a gothic soap opera, into into more overt supernatural territory, first, with the appearances of several ghosts, then, the ""Phoenix"" storyline, featuring a mysterious woman with unearthly powers who was David's mother. One the ""Phoenix"" storyline came to an end, a new supernatural arc began featuring Barnabas Collins, a resurrected 200-year-old vampire who passed himself off as a distant cousin from London.

 Barnabas Collins quickly turned into the biggest hit character on ABC since Batman (and one that would turn out to have far more staying power than the camped-up caped crusader then appearing twice a week on your bat-channel). This collection contains the historic episodes when Barnabas fully emerged from the shadows, to coin a phrase, and was firmly established as the creative centerpiece of the show, the character whom all others (and all major story lines) would revolve for the next four years.

As with the previous Dark Shadows collections, the episodes in Collection 2 are highly entertaining and addictive, if you are into the spirit of the show (unlike Megan Draper, who famously dismissed the show as ""crap"".) If you're not into the spirit of the show, you probably would not be reading reviews and considering purchasing this DVD to begin with.  Plot-wise (and I'm not giving anything away that does not appear on the episode guide that comes with the DVD) the highlights in Volume 2 include Maggie's successful escape from Barnabas's efforts to convert her into Josette, his long lost love; and Maggie's concealment in a sanitarium under the care of Dr. Julia Hoffman, who would go on to become a major character on the show (at least in these episodes, Grayson Hall gives a classic hair-on-fire performance, with some of the most esoteric line-readings in afternoon TV history).

This Collection also contains the conclusion f the long-running Jason McQuire storyline, as his efforts to blackmail Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard reach a climax and the truth of what happened about Elizabeth's husband 18 years ago finally comes out. Unlike some other story arcs, here the Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard is more prominent, and Joan Bennett is able to deliver some her finest performances in the series up to now. Several episodes, where she is nearly driven mad by Jason's extortion and awakens some of the ghosts which haunt Collinwood are the highlight of the collection.

To be honest, the narrative drive does weaken a little in the final third or so of the episodes. Apparently Barnabas was originally was conceived as a close-ended storyline, like the Phoenix arc. When it became clear that Barnabas was now the heart of the show and would have to become a regular, the writers evidently did not have any story lines for him, so they essentially recycled the Barnabas/Maggie plot, with Victoria Winters now singled out by Barnabas to become Josette, and a certain amount of repetitiveness begins to creep in, not helped by other recycled plot ideas, such staging a seance. However, in this episodes Dr. Hoffman begins closing in on Barnabas's true identity, hinting at one of the major story lines to come, her efforts to cure Barnabas of his vampirism and restore his humanity, as the producers take Barnabas, and the show, in fresher, more original directions.

This package continues the Dark Shadows video tradition of containing several highly informative and entertaining interviews with the show's cast and crew (including Dan Curtis himself). The sound and picture quality, considering the fact the original broadcasts were nearly 50 years ago now, are fine; the original film for one episode, #260, was  lost, and is presented here in kinescope (footage filmed directly off a TV broadcast), a fact mentioned in the DVD package. This package also contains brief episode summaries and original airdates.

Dark Shadows Collection 2 is highly recommended for all Dark Shadows fans and completists.",1375920000,5,4253,5.099137931034483

I wasn't a soap opera watcher until this.

Having to broadcast each day and with a limited amount of time with the equipment, the series had only one take to produce for every scene. There are slip-ups therefore, but you get used to that. I love the black and white.

When I try to describe why I like this so much, I can't figure out how.

This DVD includes scary moments, lots of suspense. Barnabus eventually begins to show some compassion. Dr. Julia Hoffman is introduced.

In Amazon, it is confusing which collection contains which episodes. Sometimes you can find the answers in the reviews. I look at the copies in the library. The episodes are listed on the back. This one contains episodes 251-290. Barnabus shows up in Episode 210, Collection One. There is a whole ""The Beginning Series"" with its own numbering. I think I watched #6, which is right before Collection One and 210. As I said, it's very confusing.",1364169600,5,1128,4.429951690821256
5046070,5,B0070B9RCO,"I don't recall how my husband and I started watching these collections, but once we started, we couldn't stop. (I think our pets thought we'd lost our minds with that crazy theme music playing every 20 minutes.)

Collection 2 is definetly better than Collection 1, which I found agonizingly SLOW. The show must not have had much of a budget for either season, as the same music keeps playing at the Blue Whale Tavern. It's a wonder this bar stayed open at all with no other customers there but than the main characters. In Collection 2, there was at least one scene with an ""extra"" standing at the juke box. (Can you imagine this actress raving to her friends in 1967?--""I got to stand by the juke box on Dark Shadows for 10 seconds!!!!!"") Heady stuff.

If listening to the little girl repetitively singing ""London Bridge"" like the Rainman in Collection 1 didn't drive you to drink, then Josette's music box in Collection 2, will. I was ready to stomp on that thing. You can't take your snack breaks during the scenes when the music box is being played--because it's being opened and closed constantly--and it's possible that you'll miss something important. But that's what keeps you hooked.

I was disappointed with the end of the Collection 2. I won't give it away, but I was wondering why the Historian (Maggie Evan's Psychiatrist, in disguise) didn't meet the same fate as Jason McGuire when she opened Barnabas' casket to find him sleeping. Stranger yet was why Barnabas didn't seem to know that she had seen him in this state. She was obviously a bigger threat to Barnabas than Jason McGuire. After Jason's participation in the Paul Stoddard Scam, no one in town would've believed him if he'd said Maggie was alive. Who knows, maybe I'll get these answers in Collection 3.

In closing, all I'll say is that I hope Ms. Historian is not around for long. I have a difficult time watching her facial ticks. You always knew when she was buying time, trying to remember her lines. She'd cock her head back and say ""...hmmm, yessss, I suppose sooooo"", then blurt out something that made absolutely no sense. It must have been so annoying to the other actors who had scenes with her. Nonetheless, the quality of the other actors' performances was excellent.",1361318400,2,2256,4.703797468354431

I have watched this whole series when it was on sci-fi, but loved it so much, I decided to buy the series and watch it from beginning to end again.",1360195200,,290,4.142857142857143

8507608,5,B0070B9RCO,"Dark Shadows is a down-to-the-basics, gothic soap opera that took me by surprise and I'm officially addicted. I was too young to recall much of its original run ( 1966 - 1971) and pretty much forgot about it. Maybe Dark Shadows fell by the wayside because television in the 1970s had begun to change and leaned more toward sitcoms, earthy dramas and big budget science fiction. As the decades passed, the nature of the vampire folklore became much more about glitz, glamor and one superhuman ability after the other. Don't get me wrong though. I love the later shows like "" Forever Knight "" and later movies like "" Blade "" "" Underworld "" and  "" Dracula Untold "" to name a few...but even though Dark Shadows was a low budget soap opera from the mid 1960's to the early 1970s, it has held up amazingly well over the decades and has earned its place as a cult classic that relied on solid acting instead of CGI to tell a complicated story. For me there's only one downside and that is the episodes are only 20 minutes long and it's very easy to binge watch a ten episode disc in one sitting. I want to make this great and underrated soap last as long as I can, so it's all about pacing myself. I HIGHLY recommend this soap opera gem !",1520726400,,1231,4.329004329004329
