2191585,3,B0006Q93AQ,"Paramount deserves to have their DVDs boycotted for making purchasers of the 4th season of ""Fraiser"" sit through ads for 3 OTHER series sets before getting to what I paid to view. The trick, I found, is using the chapter skip buttons on my remote. The buttons for Menu, Title, Fast Forward, and Pause all DO NOTHING! The way this DVD is constructed should be cause for a class action against Paramount!",1107216000,5,402,4.597222222222222
2191586,5,B0006Q93AQ,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it.",1106352000,72,1363,4.854077253218884
2191587,4,B0006Q93AQ,"In 1996-97,fans of Cheers were addicted to Dr. Frasier Crane. It is so amazing how a character that wasn't an original from the parent show could grow in popularity. That's like THE JEFFERSONS from ALL IN THE FAMILY and LAVERNE & SHIRLEY and MORK & MINDY from HAPPY DAYS. Kelsey Grammer kept being nominated for and winning Emmys for FRASIER as the show continued its run.",1106265600,,372,4.651515151515151
2191588,5,B0006Q93AQ,"Frankly, I am not interested in getting the final season because I want to see the series in the order to which it aired -- and thankfully, it isn't a tremendous wait (usually 6 months) for the 4th season after the release of the final season.",1101859200,,243,4.304347826086956

2191637,5,B0006Q93AQ,I have been happily binge watching Frasier. Every episode is enjoyable and very funny. The character's lives are evolving and most of the pitfalls that Niles and Frasier get into are the result of their own flaws of competitive sibling rivalry and personal ego trips. But there's moments where all the characters shine individually as well as together. Great show. Great cast. Great writers and direction.,1483315200,2,405,5.151515151515151

Discs arrive in plastic sealed box, inside that is actual disk box that holds the disks to keep them locked in place and scratch free. Of course in order to keep up with the series you will become a little confused if you skip around the entire set the first time. Each show leads a small clue as the next show and so on, until the surprise ending.
By the way if you like dogs you will love ""Eddie"", one of the main but unpredictable actors in the show. Just for note: There were really two ""Eddie"" dogs in the show, the older dog which played on the first 1/2 of the series and then his pup, that played the second 1/2 of the series",1425686400,,679,4.074626865671642

2192508,5,B0006Q93AQ,"A good change of pace after trite sitcoms that steer situations towards the punch line with the subtlety and grace of a rheumatic elephant. Frasier episodes are constructed seamlessly and naturally, successfully bridging high brow and knee slapping comedy. In the end, it's all about the heights and holes of the human condition, without ulterior agendas and, thankfully, holding the syrup just so. And that's what I like about Frasier: it makes me think without feeling I'm hearing a sermon. It makes me laugh without the need of a lobotomy.",1400889600,,542,5.033333333333333

2192513,5,B0006Q93AQ,"'Nough said about Frasier, Niles is our hero. More than a younger brother he is like a middle child and that makes his life experience more astounding. Betrayed by a self-serving wife, Maris, who we never see, it allows our imagination to be carried away by the dilemma of his separation from her and his infatuation with Daphne. He's the poor guy we always imagine someone else is, but not us. His humor carries a great portion of the story-line but it is as dry as his verbal combat with Roz. Will he ever escape the horrific advice of his bumbling brother and come to fruition as his own person? Only time will tell.",1399766400,,619,4.43859649122807

The characters are great, the actors superb, and the storyline is funny, endearing, and reflects the best, and worst, of all of us.  If you enjoy a smart show where the characters are easy to laugh at and with, you will really enjoy Frasier.

2192647,5,B0006Q93AQ,"Frasier is quite simply one of the most funny and entertaining television comedies ever made. It's superlative writing, extensive use of word play and double entrendre, a superb cast (both individually and also as an ensemble), witty set-pieces, and excellent direction all combine to make this show stand apart from most others, and that includes the likes of The Dick VanDyke Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and All in the Family. That may seem like a difficult claim to make, but hundreds of reviewers of Frasier that you can read here essentially all say the same thing, and after you've watched a season or two yourself (if you have not already), you may find yourself agreeing.

Frasier is a psychiatrist who has a radio talk show in Seattle, and his brother, Niles, also a psychiatrist, has his own private practice. The two brothers are extremely close, and spend most of their free time together, yet are locked in an interminable competition for love, fame, and attention. Their father, Marty, a retired policeman who was injured with a gunshot wound, forcing his retirement, lives with Frasier in his posh high-rise apartment, as does Daphne, a health care worker from Manchester, England who takes care of the father. Frasier's producer at the radio station, Roz, is a woman constantly in search of love. And the regular cast is topped off by ""Eddie,"" Marty's little doggie, who seems to be the most talented animal to appear on TV since ""Mr. Ed.""

Yes, this description sounds perhaps a bit mundane, but it is not essentially this story backdrop that makes the series what it is. It is rather the consistently superb writing and acting that makes Frasier so special, so full of laughs that you'll find yourself doubled over at times with fits (and yes, ""fits"" is probably the best word to describe it) of laughter. The show pulled in 37 Emmy's during its 11-year run, and that is only one small piece of evidence speaking to the show's quality.

Although I recommend that one start with Season One and watch the shows in order (because there is lots of building of characters and story lines that are carried through the entire show), because I am  here reviewing Season Four, I can say that this season starts out just as strong as all the others, and is sometimes pointed to by fans as one of the strongest of the 11 years. That may be true, but each season is so good that it is largely a distinction without a difference. Frasier gets us laughing in the pilot episode of Season One, and keeps us laughing all the way through the end (OK, Season Eight may not be the best, but it is still better than most other comedy shows at their best points).

Frasier also carries within it's comedy structure one of the most poignant and touching love stories ever seen on TV. It takes all 11 years for the love story to come to fruition, but it's there from the beginning, seeing it first ""peak"" in Season Two, but then at punctuated points throughout the seasons. It's a love story worth seeing, and can be both painful and joyous at times, but its as powerful a love story as you've likely ever seen on the small screen.

This show is an easy five stars.

Note:
If you wish to save about $40 - $50 dollars, you can purchase the entire 11 seasons at one time, rather than each individual season.",1361404800,,3304,4.608843537414966

2192701,3,B0006Q93AQ,"Yes, season 4 of ""Frasier"" was filled with some fantastic episodes but the DVD set leaves a lot to be desired.  First off, like a lot of people have already mentioned, you're forced to sit through several interminable minutes of ads for the first season DVD sets of ""Happy Days,"" ""Laverne & Shirley,"" and ""Mork & Mindy"" on disc 1.  Painful!  Second, there are no bonus features of any kind: no bloopers, behind-the-scenes featurettes, nothing.  C'mon, Paramount, we know you have some good stuff!  That's one of the main reasons why people buy DVDs, for all the extras!

Those are minor quibbles, however, compared to this - we do not get all the episodes in their uncut, original broadcast length!  I haven't watched them all yet but I know that at least one (""Mixed Doubles"") has been shortened a bit.  I know that shows are often trimmed during reruns for time considerations, but for crying out loud, if you can't get the full-length episodes on a ""Complete Season"" DVD set, then what's the point?

I love the show and I'll buy the rest of the DVDs but Paramount is doing ""Frasier"" a disservice by short-changing the fans like this.  I hope the rest of the seasons are complete and unedited but I'm not holding my breath.  Just thought you should know.",1199232000,23,1256,4.638009049773756

This DVD is a must have for any ""Frasier"" fan and I should know. I missed out on this TV series when it first aired but once I saw an episode, I was hooked. I have viewed this season DVD about six times already and it just makes you yearn for more. You just can not get enough of this wonderful, funny, spontaneous and endearing show. The cast of this unforgetable show makes you feel as though they really are related to one another. This DVD lets you escape into the world of Frasier with it's blown out of proportion problems and all the situations he creates for himself and those around him, while leaving your own problems temporarily, to enjoy the show.

2192705,4,B0006Q93AQ,"Frasier, Season Four, is every bit as anjoyable as its three predecessors.  Niles really steals the show this season as his new found freedom from Maris finds him searching for a partner.  The Niles and Daphne relationship grows as Niles feelings seem to deepen.  This relationship, I believe, is the soul of the series.  Martin is great, as usual, doling out criticism and advice to his two sons.

As much as the series and shows stand out on their own, I am slightly disappointed in the lack of extras on the DVDs.  I would love to see some bloopers and hear more about individual episodes, etc.  This is only a small complaint, however, as I am just glad that I live in a day and age where I can own my favorite shows.

A solid 4 stars.  Highly recommened.  I would encourage any new Frasier viewers, if there are any that are catching on late; to start at the beginning of the series.  The character growth and development has been exceptional.",1176595200,7,948,4.485380116959064

And it is fun to watch in sequence, season by season, to see the development of the characters and the progression of their ups and downs as they are meant to be seen.

2192734,5,B0006Q93AQ,"Along with Friends and Seinfeld, Kelsey Grammer's Cheers spin-off, Frasier, dominated the prime time television landscape during the 1990's. Grammer plays the role of Dr. Frasier Crane who, fresh off of his divorce from Lilith, moves back to his hometown of Seattle where he lands a gig as a radio psychiatrist. Frasier's father, Marty Crane (John Mahoney), a Seattle cop recently shot in an attempted convenience store robbery is in need of physical therapy. Frasier and his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) make an effort to mend their relationship with Marty whose plaid shirts and penchant for sports and beer strikes a dramatic contrast with their wine club, opera house culture. After a little prodding, Marty and his dog Eddie (Moose) move into Frasier's upscale apartment, and Frasier hires Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a housekeeper and physical therapist to look after the two cranes.

The entirety of the show takes place in mostly three places - Frasier's radio station where he works with show producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin), Frasier's apartment, and the favorite hangout of Niles and Frasier, Caf Nervosa. A witty comedic exploration of the nation's clash of cultures (also illustrated by Frasier's run-ins with sports guy Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe), Frasier stands alone as one of the best-written shows in television history. Not a single episode can be considered a dud.

The Frasier (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including one episode (#77) where Niles' head of hair becomes the good luck charm which turns the Sonics basketball season into one of playoff contention. Niles becomes an instant celebrity and wins over Marty's approval... Bebe Neuwirth returns in her role as Frasier's ex-wife, Dr. Lilith Sternin, in a special Thanksgiving episode where Frasier and Lilith join together to aid in Frederick's admission to a prestigious school... In the season finale, a desparately single Frasier rushes to the airport to pick up a woman, Laura (Linda Hamilton), who mistakenly left a message on his answering machine...

2192735,5,B0006Q93AQ,"It's almost not fair.  Every episode in this season is a keeper.  Not a single disappointment in the bunch!

I can't think of ANY other series that ever had such a solid streak of home runs.  Season 4 of ""Frasier"" is consistently funny and often inspired.  I dare say that it is the strongest one of the 5 seasons released to this point (as of April 2005).

The sexual tension Niles experiences over Daphne increases, and results in one of the funniest episodes of the season.

Glad to see the the company is releasing these season box sets at an acceptably rapid clip.",1113436800,5,569,4.466019417475728
2192736,4,B0006Q93AQ,"If you are a fan of the show, you probably already know that this was a year of solid writing and therefore this is a highly recommended set - one word of warning: if you are looking for a DVD with a lot of extras features, this specific set will not offer you any - no frills here - just the episodes.",1111708800,4,302,3.8870967741935485
2192747,5,B0006Q93AQ,"Frasier was about to come into its off years, but they got it exactly right in Season 4 - it's full of heavy laughs, pitch-perfect timing, meaningful characterizations, and a breezy, nimble energy that carries through one shockingly good episode after another.  I may never laugh harder at a half hour sitcom than I did during the brilliant season premiere, ""The Two Mrs. Cranes,"" which features Daphne and Roz trying to outlie each other for a random Brit's affection, or during ""Ham Radio,"" the slapstick masterpiece about Frasier trying to put on an old-time radio mastery.  The writing was the best it ever was this year, but I think that's because the characters had reached such a place of familiarity and ease that every scenario is just another grand excuse to see the bizarre ways they'll all interact.  As brilliantly embodied by the entire cast (especially, this year, by John Mahoney as Martin, and David Hyde Pierce, in the Niles golden years), it's hard not to argue that this was one of the funniest years of any sitcom in television history.",1109635200,23,1057,4.828729281767956
2192748,3,B0006Q93AQ,"Season four of the Emmy-winning comedy ""Frasier"" treads familiar sit-com ground in familiar sit-com ways that seem, for the first time since the show's premiere, to be strained. By now, as devotees of the show, we've become accustom to Dr. Frasier Crane's (Kelsey Grammer) neurotic way with his phone-in radio guests and friends, his manic-depressive relationship with ex-wife Lilith (Bebe Newirth), and his need to control his brother, Niles' (David Hyde Pierce) on again/off again relationship with ex wife, Meris. To be certian the old chemistry between these characters and other alumi; Roz (Peri Gilpin), Daphne (Jane Leeves) and Martin (John Mahoney) is alive and kicking. But there seems to be a sincere attempt on the part of the show's producers to defuse this chemistry where ever possible. Primary to this point is the introduction of Martin's new girlfriend, Sherri (Marsha Mason). She's in practically every episode. Her initial gregarious nature, meant to illicit a grating on the nerves of Frasier and Niles, quickly begins to have the same effect on the audience. In fact, from about episode four to the end of the season, Sherri takes over as the focal point of much of the action. It's remarkable how little play time Daphne and Nile's head game romance gets during this season. Or how little we get to see of Roz and her relationship fiascos.

There are still great episodes scattered throughout the seaon; such as ""A Lilith Thanksgiving"" in which Frasier and Lilith invade the home of a stuffy private school head master to convince him to take on their son Frederick. Or the hilarious radio-land murder mystery spoof, ""Ham Radio"" in which a frustrated Niles - having been forced to play six different characters, takes to popping balloons to symbolize the murder of said characters so he no longer has to narrate for them. And then there's ""The Impossible Dream"" - an episode in which Frasier cannot stop fantasizing about a sexual relationship between him and food critic, Gil Chesterton (Edward Hibbert). It has to rank as one of the very best episodes in the entire series.

Transfer quality for season four is pretty much middle of the road. While colors can be rich and vibrant, the overall picture quality is one of gaudy flatness. There doesn't seem to be much depth to the acting space and quite often the lighting speaks to a very warm characteristic which is not complimentary to the performances. There's also the continued problem of edge enhancement present in nearly every episode. Fine details shimmer considerably in several episodes. Unlike the previous box sets, there are no extra features on disc four this time around. Sure wish that was indicative of Paramount's price point. Overall, then, this isn't exactly one of ""Frasier's"" best seasons but if you've been collecting the series thus far, you'll want to run out and add number four to your roster.",1108944000,10,2894,4.989648033126294
2192749,5,B0006Q93AQ,"Frasier is, for my money, the best sitcom ever presented on American TV.  The comedy on this wonderful show runs across all genres from slapstick to drawing room farce.  And the dialogue is aguably in the same class as the best of the 1930's screwball comedies!  If Preston Sturges were alive, he would have been writing for Frasier.

The fourth season of Frasier is the best yet.  The interplay between Frasier and Niles and their father is a joy to behold.  Frasier is the only TV show that consistently has me rolling on the floor with laughter.  And, the supporting players, from Bulldog to Roz, cross all comedic and encomic lines!  And what great lines they are...

I love being able to buy these quality shows in their entirety so that I can watch them without commercials and at a time of my chosing.  And, with the price drop for Season 4, it's gotten even better!  According to tvshowsontv.com, Paramount will be releasing 3 more seasons in 2005!  It doesn't get much better than this for comedy fans.

I recommend this show to all intelligent and discriminating TV viewers.",1108598400,18,1084,4.671957671957672
2192750,4,B0006Q93AQ,"Continuing it's extrodinary run, the fourth season of Frasier provides many comic highlights and unforgettable moments of this classic show at its creative peak.

Starting with ""The Two Mrs. Cranes"" (a great comic romp), through ""Ham Radio"" (which has perhaps the funniest mis-pronounciation in 'Frasier' history) to ""Daphne Hates Sherry"" (my personal favorite with a wonderfully funny ending), the show is clearly at it's creative peak with a cast that is both comfortible with their roles and still eager to please. There is more poking of fun at Frasier Crane (played to absolute perfection by Kelsey Grammer) and his sexual orientation (""The Impossible Dream"") as well as his terrible luck with dates (""Three Dates and a Breakup"" which is an hour-long show).

The other cast members, especially David Hyde Pierce, are in top form with episodes that emphisize their abilities (""Head Games"" in particular since Kelsey Grammer was in rehab at the time.  Although he does appear at the beginning of the episode). Even Bulldog gets into the act with ""Love Bites Dog"" where he falls hard for an ex-pro golfer that he steals from Frasier.

Having said all that, the reason I gave this DVD collection only four stars is its lack of any extras.  While I can understand no cast interviews (this compilation probably took place after ""Frasier"" ended), I still do not comprehend why there are no bloopers or extra footage (deleted scenes or just the small part of scenes that were trimmed out).  Or at least some menu pages that cover what awards the show won (Emmys) and other information.

Even worse are three commercials for other DVD sets that automatically appear at the beginning of disc one.  You can use the ""skip"" to get past them, but it is still very annoying.

This does not bode well for the remaining series to be released, but if the price is kept down (I got this one for less than $30) then it might be worth it.

I would rank 4th season behind the 2nd, but it's still one of the best and it's a little better than the 3rd season.

For those unfamiliar with ""Frasier"" (those who have lived in a cave since the early '90s) I would suggest you catch some of the syndicated re-runs on your local channel first.  But if you like what you see, then by all means go out and purchase the DVD sets.

Trivia Bits:
- As stated before, ""Three Dates and a Breakup"" is the first hour-long Frasier episode (that I'm aware of).  Which is why there are only 23 shows in this particular season.

- ""Four for the Seesaw"" features future ""Will and Grace"" star Megan Mullally.

- Jane Leeves got a major hairstyle change between Season 3 and Season 4.  Her hair is much shorter and she looks more ""glamorous"" than before, which is either a good or bad thing depending on your point of view.  Interestingly enough, her character Daphne mentions this change in ""Death and the Dog"".

- Eddie's dream, featured in the stinger for the episode ""Impossible Dream"", uses footage from the stinger of the first season episode ""Author, Author"".

- The episode ""Ask Me No Questions"" features a long outside-the-studio filmed sequence of Frasier wondering the streets of Seattle (more likely, the backlots of Paramount studios or the sidestreets of LA) when he comes across a theatre playing the Jack Benny classic, ""To Be or Not To Be"".  Upon seeing the sign, Kelsey reacts by placing his hand up to his face, which was Jack Benny's classic signature look.  Kelsey Grammer has said that he's a huge Jack Benny fan.",1108598400,3,3492,4.71828665568369
2192751,5,B0006Q93AQ,"Sadly I missed out on the last season and caught what I could from the seasons since the Niles secret was out in 1999. Thankfully, these box sets allow me to catch up when ever I wish.  Screw reruns on TV!

  I went and bought the first one . . . then the fourth . . . then I just went out got the rest!  Season four is supurb.  It's high brow humor that everyone can get. Even if you're not a wine and cheese person this show maintains a level of quality that no other show could touch. And, dare I say that the 11 year run that Frasier had was superior to the run that it's forerunner(Cheers) had.

  My favourite episodes from this set are ""Our father's art aint heaven"", ""Love bites dog"", and ""The impossible dream""!

  The writting is a 10 and the ensamble is impossible to match.  One of the best show's ever.  Take that Seinfeld and M*A*S*H!",1108425600,2,848,4.154320987654321
2192752,5,B0006Q93AQ,GReatest writing i have ever seen. Could do with out the commercials in the beginning of disc.,1107820800,3,94,4.588235294117647
2192753,5,B0006Q93AQ,"The recent TV reruns of Frasier have mostly been from the last two seasons of the series, so it is good to get the chance to see shows from the early and middle years on DVD. One episode especially stands out from season four, ""To Kill A Talking Bird"", when Niles has a bird attached to his head and the bird is repeating everything it hears - ""Cute But Stupid"" !! That particular show absolutely cracks me up ! The writing team from the Cheers and Frasier programs are absolute masters at witty, urbane humor. I do agree with another reviewer that the opening advertisements for Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley and Mork & Mindy are very annoying, but it won't affect my rating for a great season four of Frasier.",1107820800,3,711,4.435114503816794
2192754,1,B0006Q93AQ,"My one star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the DVD or the acting or the writing.  It has to do with the fact that the first DVD begins with three minutes and twenty seconds of advertisements for a Happy Days DVD, a Laverne and Shirley DVD and a Mork and Mindy DVD.  You can't fast forward through this stuff.  (I suppose you can change your video source and watch something else while the commercials play, however.) Anytime you want to watch anything on the first DVD, you'll have to wait for 3:20 in addition to waiting for the FBI warning and the Paramount intro to play before you get to the content screen.  Usually, I watch no more than one or two episodes at a time.  So, this is very inconvenient.  I'm not going to buy any of those other DVDs anyway.  Making me sit through the ads all the time shows how little regard Paramount has for its customers.  This is what happens when the money guys and the marketing guys stop paying attention to what is best for the customer.  Not only that, but on the menu there is a selection for ""previews"", just in case you want to watch those advertisements all over again.  These guys must be nuts!

Aside from that, I've watched the first DVD and part of the second one in this package and am happy with my purchase.  The last episode on the first disc is one of my favorites.  It's the one where Daphne gets a new boyfriend who turns out to be a Niles clone.  The performances are first rate and the writing is of the usual quality.  I just hope there are no ads cluttering the 5th season DVD when it's released.",1107820800,19,1574,4.27027027027027
2192755,5,B0006Q93AQ,"This season is one of the best.  There is only one episode that I don't care to watch. I also have season 3, but there are many episodes that I would never choose to watch.  This one has great episodes such as the Ham Radio, Roz as the Angel of Death, etc.  This is definitely one worth getting and watching over and over.",1107302400,2,322,4.079365079365079

You know, the snap holder that holds an individual disc in pace using a small set of plastic fittings that attach to the disc through the center hole? Well, on one of my disc-holders has only one { out of four } fasteners and it does just a centimeter away from nothing to keep one of the discs from sliding around in the DVD case!

Leave it up to the wonderful cast and superb writers to deal with heavy and dark themes such as death and loss in such a funny way.  Season 4, we see the Frasier cast really come together as a family yet it's early enough for them not to seem too familiar with each other so there's still that adorable awkwardness about them.
