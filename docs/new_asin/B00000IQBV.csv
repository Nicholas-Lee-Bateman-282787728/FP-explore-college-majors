7911266,3,B00000IQBV,"Michael Dudikoffs popularity as an action hero is a mystery that Ill probably never understand, but his output on the direct-to-video market was pretty consistent, even as the home video slump of the late 90s began. 1998s Counter Measures may be a pretty good vehicle as far as fans are concerned but can be regarded as an average low-budget adventure for the rest of us. Full of Cold War throwbacks and an agreeable amount of decent action, this is the fare of slow Saturday nights or Dudikoff completionists.

The story: A Navy SEAL-turned-medic (Dudikoff,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cobra/dp/B002DQSKN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cobra</a>) finds himself trapped on a nuclear submarine commandeered by the crew of a merciless idealist (James Horan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Resurrection/dp/B00ARWX5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Resurrection</a>) planning to recreate the Soviet Union by starting a world war.

The film is directed by cheapo connoisseur Fred Olen Ray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Universe/dp/B000AYYV8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Universe</a>), whose economic style is evident in the ample use of recycled footage and the unconvincing submarine set. Beyond this, the movie is competently made but registers a notable cheese factor for its laughably patriotic, anti-red overtones: an anthemic orchestra kicks in every time we catch sight of a US naval ship, while many scenes featuring Russian characters open with a foreboding bellicose score. Villain James Horan is about as evil as the script demands of him but is all the more memorable for it  at least more so than Dudikoff. Dudikoffs sidekick is played by short-lived action star Alexander Keith/Wendy Schumacher (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fugitive-Rage/dp/B00000GO6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fugitive Rage</a>), whose conventional role was probably edited to allow for some butt-kicking when the producers found out that s/he puts on a better fight scene than Michael.

Speaking of fight scenes, they are the heart of this ones action content, which is otherwise limited to some shootouts and a ho-hum submarine battle. The eight fights are middle-of-the-road type stuff, even when considering the most exciting ones like Keiths two-on-one brawl and the unexpectedly sound encounter of Lada Boder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primal-Instinct/dp/B0001WTVKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primal Instinct</a>). Dudikoff is serviceable and makes grisly use of a corkscrew in more than one brawl, but his fights are not only predictable, they sometimes go beyond general suspension of disbelief. For example, Id buy that Dudikoffs character can defeat the one played by MMA heavyweight Oleg Taktarov, but I have a hard time believing in the ridiculously slow strikes of a fire extinguisher that he uses to do the job.

Nevertheless, the fact that the movie keeps a good pace and is never boring is enough to buy it a passing score from me. If you're a general action fan and not too disappointed by the fact that the fighter jets featured on the DVD cover don't seem to appear in the movie, you may have the same impression.",1457654400,,3346,6.249457700650759

7911270,3,B00000IQBV,"I gave this a three star, because this wasn't one of Michael Dudikoff's better movies. It to me just didn't have that wow facture like some of his other movies. This movie was about the Russians taking over this sub. This sub had a bomb on it that they were going to set off. The Russians used a gas to kill everyone on the sub, but one of their men got his mask pulled of. So the head of Russian asked the U.S. to help send a doctor to save one their soldier's life. So this is were Michael Dudikoff and another army doctor get sent to help. But the U.S didn't know that they were also going to be kill once they saved their friends life. Both Michael and the girl get shot, but Michael saves the day and kill all the the Russians and the girl stops the bomb form going off.",1400630400,,775,4.038961038961039
7911271,5,B00000IQBV,Delivered on time and in great condition. Outstanding graphics and tons of action. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Must see,1389052800,,133,5.090909090909091
7911272,1,B00000IQBV,"Ok, I should have rented this movie from the library first before wasting my money on this stink burger...
The sub was too big and there was too much walking space, they ripped off too many scenes from Crimson Tide and Hunt for the Red October which were far better movies then this one.  I strongly recomend you buy something else like Crimson Tide or Das Boot if you like submarine movies.",1018483200,3,391,4.430555555555555
7911273,1,B00000IQBV,"I have seen some pretty cheesy movies with bad acting, but Counter Measures has to be in the top five worst films of all time.
The story line, which has some great potential, is completely destroyed by the poor acting ability of the cast. Dudikoff can't even salute correctly - and he is supposed to be a SEAL??? Alexander Keith, while very attractive, does a very poor job convincing the viewer that she is a military solder. As for her role, I have heards better screams out 1950's era b-movies.
The scenes inside the sub where just as bad. Was that a Russian sub or the Starship Enterprise. I've seen houses with less room than the sub had.
The Special FX were attrocious, I've seen more realistic explosions using green plastic army men and firecrackers.
All in all just a very bad film and a complete waste of time.",1011657600,4,820,4.510067114093959
