1) Jessica Smith - she is a likeable instructor, knows what she's doing and cues well
2) no fancy moves, everything is pretty much doable but still get's the job done

1) I own Women Health's DVD ( with the same instructor and I believe from the same publisher ) that offers you a possibility to mix and match your workout - you can choose what you want to do, in what sequence, whether you want to repeat a workout segment more than once. It's a shame that something like that is not offered here, I find it very practical
2) workouts are fairly short - only when I did everything back to back did I get a decent, 50 min workout. On the DVD it is suggested that you do weight training every other day, abs twice a week and cardio at least once - I am simply not sure it would be enough..",1212624000,15,824,4.15

There is some cardio too which is good for overall fat burning - it's not too dificult to do and mainly geared for intermediates.  They give you low impact options if the higher impact is too tough to do or if you have bad joints.  I have to say that the stretch at the end is really nice and worth the price of the dvd alone.  All you need are some dumbbells and you're good to go.  It's led well, and while I won't use it all the time, it's good to go back to it everynow and then to keep myself from workout boredom.",1209427200,38,826,3.963636363636364

I have quite a few workouts with this instructor --- she is a little more smiley and peppy than I usually like but somehow still works for me.  Two backup ""dancers"" are non-annoying and low impact modifications are available.  Music is minimal --- would have preferred something with strong beat that you can hear and follow easily without watching screen the whole time.  [update:  did the cardio segment with music only --- awesome!!! Great beat, great music, and the instructors mostly move in time to the music. cool down segment at end was 80s bad but the rest was really great.]

As others have noted, this is a no-frills straight forward workout. I used 10 lbs on weight segments since the reps are rather low and slow (perfect for higher weights.)  Cardio consists of lots of jogging, squatting, jumping, jacks with long durations of each move and repeated cycles.  For those that are easily bored and want a new and unusual move every five moves (like the Firm workouts I've tried), this is not for you.  That said, I don't mind the simplicity as long as I get a good workout.  This fit my level perfectly so I sweated big time but could easily keep up.

Based on the bonus nutrition segment on DVD, the abs diet seems misnamed.  It basically seems like the usual eat healthy type diet, so I must be missing why the name is ab-centric.  I think this probably would have gone better if not advertised under the abs diet concept.

This book says all the right things and its workout plans and exercise programs are very doable even for a woman in my condition.  After six weeks of the program I have made significant strength improvement in my legs and upper body.  I stand up straighter and so I look better.

I can't say that I have lost pounds on the scale and my belly fat is still my predominant issue, but my pants fit a little looser.

The major improvement in this book is a very reasonable 7 day approach to exercise with adequate rest inbetween for even my muscle fibers to heal.  Actually this regimen was more effective than the physical therapy that was given to me after my hip replacement 2 years ago.

I recommend this book to everyone.  If it works for me with my limitations, it should work extremely well for you.  If you are younger and or stronger, you should be able to take it and run with it.  I would expect the weight to slide off you without feelings of hunger and by the end of six weeks, I know you will feel energized and stronger.

It is humerous and easy to read.  The food suggestions are quick and easy.  The exercise routines do not need to take much time out of your busy schedule and you do not need to have fancy equipment.

3045582,3,B00104AYZQ,"I overall like this workout DVD.  I like Jessica, the instructor.  However, I purchased this DVD to WORK MY ABS.  That's my trouble area...I had high hopes to whip my abs into shape.  (I had never heard of 'The Abs Diet,' it was just an impulse buy when this DVD was brand new ~ I was going solely by the name.)  If you choose to play all of the ""mini"" workouts on the DVD, it doesn't really work your abs a whole lot.
  After doing the complete workout....the next day my calves were KILLING me.  I wished that my abs were sore, but they weren't....just my calves were sore, for days. (This happened b/c of the cardio portion of the DVD where you jog in place forever.)
  That's all I have to say about this one....hope it helps.  In short, don't buy this DVD b/c of the name.  It's not an ab workout!  However, if you're looking for a little variety to your usual workout routine....you may like it.",1238371200,9,901,4.260355029585799

Keep in mind, I'm very active, but sweat was pouring off me by the time I got to the yoga at the end!  There's also a quick video blurb about the abs diet.  A very good workout, and goes great with the eating plan.",1230854400,9,371,3.7662337662337664
3045584,2,B00104AYZQ,"I have to admit, I probably own around 200 workouts.  And, of ALL of them, this one probably has the Most Boring Cardio segement.  Good points on the cardio are that it requires little space and does raise your heart rate.  However, I cannot conquer the dread factor that comes from the repetiveness in the cardio!  Seriously, where is the imagination?  You spend well OVER HALF the cardio segment simply jogging in place.  Just that: Jogging!  And, the few intervals of not-jogging are repetitve in themselves.  (No combos, you just repeat a move more intense that jogging for 30-90 seconds; so, for instance, you might jog for 3 minutes, then do jump squats for 1.)  INCREDIBLY DULL!  I will never do the cardio segment again. The toning segments are good and fun; so I kept this dvd for them alone.  If I could rate the toning and cardio seperately, I would.  I would like to give the Cardio exactly half of a star.  I would give the toning a full four stars;  well, four and half.  If you expect imagination and choreography:buyer beware.  This instructor DOES have another dvd (Women's Health Train for Your Body Type) which I would recommend instead.  It has really solid, fun toning segments.  The cardio on it is not particularly imaginative or exciting, but she does far less jogging in place (but, yes, she still doest that!  why????).  If you tried it and thought that cardio was dull, you will never survive this one!  I would give that whole video a solid 4 stars.  Check in out.  Both are nicely chaptered.",1228348800,11,1520,4.631578947368421

3280080,5,B00104AYZQ,"I loved this workout!  It's broken up into 6 mini workouts, or you can run them all.  I just ran them all, and it was the best workout I've had in a while.  Keep in mind, I'm very active, but sweat was pouring off me by the time I got to the yoga at the end!  There's also a quick video blurb about the abs diet.  A very good workout, and goes great with the eating plan.",1230854400,9,371,3.7662337662337664
3280081,2,B00104AYZQ,"I have to admit, I probably own around 200 workouts.  And, of ALL of them, this one probably has the Most Boring Cardio segement.  Good points on the cardio are that it requires little space and does raise your heart rate.  However, I cannot conquer the dread factor that comes from the repetiveness in the cardio!  Seriously, where is the imagination?  You spend well OVER HALF the cardio segment simply jogging in place.  Just that: Jogging!  And, the few intervals of not-jogging are repetitve in themselves.  (No combos, you just repeat a move more intense that jogging for 30-90 seconds; so, for instance, you might jog for 3 minutes, then do jump squats for 1.)  INCREDIBLY DULL!  I will never do the cardio segment again. The toning segments are good and fun; so I kept this dvd for them alone.  If I could rate the toning and cardio seperately, I would.  I would like to give the Cardio exactly half of a star.  I would give the toning a full four stars;  well, four and half.  If you expect imagination and choreography:buyer beware.  This instructor DOES have another dvd (Women's Health Train for Your Body Type) which I would recommend instead.  It has really solid, fun toning segments.  The cardio on it is not particularly imaginative or exciting, but she does far less jogging in place (but, yes, she still doest that!  why????).  If you tried it and thought that cardio was dull, you will never survive this one!  I would give that whole video a solid 4 stars.  Check in out.  Both are nicely chaptered.",1228348800,11,1520,4.631578947368421

I would just like to provide a breakdown of workouts from this DVD and time it takes for each workout, since I didn't find this in the description or in any of the reviews that I thought would be helpful:

Warm Up:  2:30 minutes
Abs I:  6 mins.

Cardio Interval:  17 minutes (appx. 20 including the warm-up)

8236831,5,B00104AYZQ,"Although I have not watched the video in its entirety,  I am very pleased on how the workouts are put together where you can work out in short segments instead of 1 long drawn out video that I barely have time for.  I also learned that you can alternate a regular workout with seconds of intense exercises to really speed up and make the work out more effective.  I am really excited about watching the rest of the video to learn more about getting great abs!",1411344000,,459,4.313953488372093

8236834,5,B00104AYZQ,"This workout is great because of Jessica Smith. She is a very sweet, cheerful, pretty instructor and she cues very well. I enjoy doing this workout on a regular basis. I may be male, but I get a great workout every time I do it. I like having a female instructor guide me when I do my workouts because I find them to be better instructors and more encouraging. Too bad she doesn't instruct the regular ""Abs Diet Workout"" DVD's, too. This is a must for men and women.",1402272000,,466,4.247191011235955
