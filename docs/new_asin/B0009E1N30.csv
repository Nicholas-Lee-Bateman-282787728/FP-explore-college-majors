8059377,3,B0009E1N30,"`Born to Fight' is a Thai action film directed by Panna Rittikrai, the martial arts choreographer for `Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior.' This means `Born to Fight' contains as many action sequences as `Ong-Bak,' which some say is a trend-setter of martial action movies. And as to the stunts of `Born to Fight,' I can assure you that they are top-notch ones, using no wires and CGI.

The film is about a cop Deaw (Dan Chupong), who finds himself in kind of `Die Hard'-like situation. While he is visiting a peaceful village with his sister and other athletes, armed forces attack the place mercilessly, and the villagers are taken hostage by them. The group are equipped with machine-guns, explosives, and a guided nuke missile.

The plot is tightly done, but of course the best thing of `Born to Fight' is its stunts. Dan Chupong's character fights baddies on the running trucks, and the unlucky villains land heavily on the ground. Or, if more unlucky ones fall, they fall on the roof of the van next or behind the truck. One of the stuntmen got nearly killed, almost run over by the wheels of the truck.

There are more to come, and the climax sequences are full of unique (or cheesy) ones using the sports ability of other supports. One uses footballs to beat the baddies, and some use tae kwon do, or Sepaktakraw (Indonesian sports like volleyball using only feet). In this village, apparatus gymnastics also come in handy.

[TOO BLOODY AND VIOLENT] These exciting stunts aside, `Born to Fight' is often uncomfortable and even unpleasant to see. Extended and bloody killing is unnecessary and the overuse of guns (by the bad guys mainly) is at odd with the acrobatic stunts. And sometimes (just sometimes) it becomes clear that they borrowed ideas from other actions. When a huge truck runs down the hill, the hair-raising stunt in one Jackie Chan film in the 80s would come to your mind.

Though the comparison with `Ong-Bak' is inevitable, `Born to Fight' is not trying to imitate the style of Tony Jaa, whose character is a stranger to gun, and probably is rather proud of it. `Born to Fight' has many guns in it, and I'm afraid too many of them.  The film has many brilliant stunts, and the bloopers at the end credits will show us the glimpse of the great efforts to achieve them, though not everything in the film is helping to enhance the effects of these bone-crunching fight. In short, less guns and body counts, the better the film is. That's my rule for martial arts action because, you know, it should be about martial arts after all.",1137283200,6,2545,4.669642857142857
8059378,5,B0009E1N30,"If you liked ONG BAK the tai warrior your gonna love this movie.  This is straight up the hottest flick ive ever seen with the exception of maybe ONG BAK, they are equal.  No stunt doubles No CGI effects No Bull. this movie is crazy!! The film begins with the arrest of this general (This scene is CRAZY!) and soon after rebels siege a small tai village, kill many people and threaten bankok with a nuclear missile unless there general is released.  The villagers then fight back, and boy can they fight.  The film uses great filming and camera angles with the ill slow motion and multi angles just like ONG BAK and also like ONG BAK it has one of the hottest techno/trance soundtracks ive ever heard.  I bought this with no review thats why im giving one.  If you like action movies, fight movies or martial art movies you will absolutly love this one.  My jaw has never dropped so many times.  After seeing this and Ong Bak I don't think I can ever enjoy American action films the same way again after seeing the best action flicks with no special effects and no stunt doubles American movies just have to many effects to even enjoy now.",1129420800,9,1139,4.416267942583732
