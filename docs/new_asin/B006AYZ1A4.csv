4981931,5,B006AYZ1A4,"I ordered the ""Compendium Vol 1"" from Bluscenes, and when it arrived, I found that the special 12-disc case had been damaged in shipping.  I sent Scenic Labs an email, explaining the issue, and a very helpful fellow named Jason got back to me within 24hrs.  He arranged to ship me a new case right away, and I couldn't be happier... with the 1080p ""Eye Candy"" discs, and with the new case.  The variety of material in this set is a real treat.  If you have ANY interest in this type of video, I heartily recommend the ""BluScenes Compendium"".  It ROCKS!!",1335916800,,553,4.435643564356436
4981932,3,B006AYZ1A4,I purchased this blu ray set to test out my HD tv it looks amazing and its fun to put on when you have company over. The downside i would say is how they filmed it... this is especially present when watching the fish tank ones i was expecting to have the whole fish tank in display that was not the case seeing they focused on a portion of the tank making it dissapointing since half the time the fish would swim out of range leaving you with coral.... i havnt watched all of them but the ones i have watched all have the same problem it was captured in odd ways... one of the discs focuses on lighthouses wich i don't understand and have no interest in watching.... i enjoy the set having paid only 30 dollars compared to the 90 its retail price was!! wich is def not worth it but other than that it is a good way to have something on the tv that you don't have to pay attention to while entertaining!!!,1334016000,3,904,4.112994350282486
4981933,5,B006AYZ1A4,"Soothing...invigorating...relaxing...motivating...etc, etc_ing!!! Super fast shipping...Wow!

In addition to basic purpose of this HD Movie scenery as theme, ambience, environment, background, etc. I used this as an accompaniment to my Indoor Rowing exercises routine. Audio choices fantastic.",1333756800,2,293,7.138888888888889
4981934,5,B006AYZ1A4,This was the first time I purchased the Blue  Ambient discs and I just love them. So relaxing and the color is so vivid.,1333238400,2,120,4.0
4981935,5,B006AYZ1A4,"I purchased this set for the office lobby. There is a TV in the lobby and while the guys like to watch sports, in between sporting events, I like to have nature programs or something beautiful and quiet on the nice LCD TV. The I came across BluScenes box set. Amazing!!! Fantastic!!! Captivating!!! Relaxing!!! Just to name a few. My favorites: Space, both aquariums, gallery muse, fractal plane, gallery moderna fireplace and underwater Cozumel. The lighthouses one, turns out, are of the Pacific Northwest. I live in Seattle, I recognized them all. The flower and the waterfalls were very nice as well.

All the discs are backed with gentle music. I opt to turn the music way way down so it can be barely heard, or off completely.

OH, and the BEST PART! All the discs loop. I forgot to turn the player off one night when I left work and it was still going the next day.

So, for anybody looking to enhance their HD TV with ambiance and art, I highly recommend this box-set. The only down-side? There isn't another box-set, but apparently it IS in the works so I'll just have to be patient :)",1332979200,3,1094,4.515151515151516
4981936,5,B006AYZ1A4,"Well first off I purchased the whole set. It is well worth it, these discs turn my TV into a window full of awesome scenes...of course, I get to choose! All of the discs have the options for audio adjustment 2.0, 5.1, 7.1 and looping the scenes as well. All the video is 1080p and the natural scenes are REAL videos not computer generated, which is kind of nice. Definitely worth it!",1328054400,4,383,4.333333333333333
4981937,5,B006AYZ1A4,Great item with very relaxing video and music. My order was shipped on time and they have excellent customer service as well!,1324598400,5,125,4.7272727272727275

8495875,1,B006AYZ1A4,"The quality of the BlueRays is not great. I rather just stream from youtube, since quality is not much better.",1512259200,,110,4.55
8495876,4,B006AYZ1A4,"Of the 12 disks, I only really like six or seven.  The rest were just so-so.  Good quality video.",1477180800,,97,4.052631578947368

8495879,5,B006AYZ1A4,"These recordings are incredibly beautiful, varied, and manageable.  One may choose to view in silence, with natural sounds and/or with lovely music.  I had some trouble only because my player was not up-to-date; help was right there when I called the company.  Worth every penny!",1445126400,,279,5.155555555555556
8495880,5,B006AYZ1A4,"In a word: Mesmerizing.  A great variety of HD video clips that can be looped, etc.  The aquarium selections are great, and the Fractal Graphics will put you into a trance.  Great way to show off a big High Def TV screen.",1409702400,,221,4.214285714285714
8495881,5,B006AYZ1A4,"I was looking for crisp clear blue ray video with natural sounds and / or multi-channel audio that I could use to help me meditate.  This compendium definitely delivers.  You have a choice of 7.1 music and natural surround, 5.1 music surround or 2 channel natural sound on each disk.  Production was very well done.  Each disk has clear, simple menus and you can loop any part you wish.

If my dentist put one of these on the video screen in the waiting room, I might sleep through my next visit.

I don't love all the disks to the same degree and the package arrived with broken hinges but given the value of this compendium, I just could not bring myself to give it four stars.",1402617600,,679,4.349206349206349
8495882,4,B006AYZ1A4,"The variety, quality, look and sound were all outstanding.  I wish they had one more ""art"" disc that wasn't just linked to impressionistic painting but in all honesty, they sent what they said they were going to so it was not surprise (and certainly not a disappointment) to me.  Unique product that I'm very pleased with!",1354924800,,322,4.732142857142857
8495883,5,B006AYZ1A4,"First off, I bought this from Fab.com for $37.95 (new, sealed).  For that price, this 12-disc set was a steal.  I had shopped this item previously, but had difficulty deciding which discs to purchase.  This set solved that problem immediately.  The audio quality is excellent, with DTS 7.1HD as my preferred listening mode.  The music is all original and complements the video nicely.  The nature discs allow selection of music or natural sounds (waterfalls, crackling fires, etc.)  The nature scenes are spectacular, but my fave is the Fractal disc...totally mesmerizing. There are times when I love to read; I enjoy music, but don't want the distraction of TV programming. This is a perfect solution.  You won't regret your purchase!",1339632000,3,735,5.117647058823529
