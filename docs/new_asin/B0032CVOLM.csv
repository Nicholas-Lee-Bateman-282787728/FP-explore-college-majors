8387419,5,B0032CVOLM,"Hard to explain how good this DVD is. It's well done, and has very good suggestions about what to prepare and have on hand BEFORE your bird gets lost, so if that ever happens, you know exactly what to do, and have all the materials you need, ready to go.

Wish this was bundled as a bonus with every bird related DVD, so bird owners would have it and watch it before a bird escapes, instead of after.

Not easy to find it in DVD format nowadays, but it's still available as an instant online rental through Good Bird Inc. (one of the creators of the DVD)",1457654400,2,554,4.168224299065421
