5679131,2,B00BW4S89S,Not one of Stephen King's best movies.  We watched it and gave it away.  I thought it was a cheap-made movie.,1397692800,,109,4.142857142857143
5679132,5,B00BW4S89S,I purchased this to complete my Stephen King collection. The dvd was good quality with good sound unlike some DVDs that are blurry and very poor sound quality.,1387065600,5,159,4.714285714285714
5679133,2,B00BW4S89S,"""Stephen King's Golden Years"" is one of the writer's television forays into science fiction rather than horror.  Janitor Harlan Williams (Keith Szarabajka), who works at an experimental reactor, is being retired against his will.  He is exposed to green radiation when the reactor goes critical, after which he starts getting younger and develops psychic powers.  He and his wife (Frances Sternhagen) and a government agent (Felicity Huffman) must go on the run and cope with Harlan's transformation.  It's not as good as ""The Langoliers"" or ""Tommyknockers"" but it kept me interested to the end when it originally aired.

I previously bought the 2001 DVD release of ""Golden Years"" which was one long movie 236 minutes (2 hrs 56 min) long on 1 disc which has a different ending from the series/miniseries.  This 2013 DVD re-release was billed as ""the uncut miniseries"", so I foolishly bought it and found that it runs...2 hrs 56 minutes long, just split into 2 parts over 2 discs.  The uncut series ran seven 46-minute episodes (322 minutes or 5 hrs 22 min). The only other difference from the 2001 release is the ending, which is the series version.  Part 1 just cuts out somewhere in the middle of what would be Episode 3.  Somebody at the company decided that the series was too long to release on DVD, so they edited the last five episodes down to the length of three. If you want the uncut version don't buy this!! I guess I can't get rid of my old VHS copies yet!

Rating: 4 stars for the series, 1 star for this release, average = 2.5 stars.",1383091200,49,1547,4.654411764705882
