2439510,5,B000BSNIVY,"I belong to a senior exercise group and we have been using this tape for several years and it is one of our favorites. Not only do you stand, use a chair, you also use weights. Anyone can do these exercies no matter what age group. I wish I could find more tapes or DVDs by Bev Harris.",1287964800,,285,3.9310344827586206
2439511,5,B000BSNIVY,"This is a very good fitness tape for mature adults, or people that have problems with aerobic type exercise. It's been wonderful for my fibromylgia, and is something I'm finally able to do.",1264118400,2,189,4.757575757575758
2439512,5,B000BSNIVY,This is a wonderful tape my age group.  It covers all parts of the body.,1254009600,2,72,3.8
2439513,5,B000BSNIVY,"Finally I found an exercise video I will use.  I am 56 years old and beginning a diet and exercise program.  I purchased several videos to help me and this is by far the best. Bev Harris motivates and encourages and at the same time is a ""real person"".  She does a good job explaining what to do and I don't feel terribly uncoordinated or self conscious while following along.  The exercise routine includes warm-up, upper body using light hand weights, aerobic, lower body and cool-down.  Many of the exercises can be done from a sitting position if you can't stand.  The other people exercising on the video are real people, not skinny 25 year old models.  I would definitely recommend this video.

Update (December 2012): After responding to a post about this product I thought maybe I would include the suggestion I made to the poster regarding her used VHS tape that broke after continuous use as part of my review.  My suggestion (what I did with my Bev Harris VHS tape) is to take the tape somewhere that will transfer a VHS tape to DVD for you. The quality isn't as good as a new DVD would be but it is certainly useable. If your VHS tape breaks possibly you could get it repaired but to me it would be worth the cost to buy another just to use for the transfer to DVD. I really wish that Bev Harris exercise video's were still available and could be found on DVD but since they're not I think this is the best long term option.",1213833600,12,1436,4.368421052631579

8091823,5,B000BSNIVY,"I love it because the workouts are amazing, so was Bev. I highly suggest that you get this video. It will be worth it,",1402099200,,118,3.9583333333333335
8091824,5,B000BSNIVY,Excellent full body workout.  This is really a great video for seniors or people that need an easier way to get a good workout!,1396310400,,127,4.291666666666667
8091825,5,B000BSNIVY,"Great - This was a good workout, but nothing that I found too difficult to do.  Barbara (76 years old)",1392854400,,102,4.1
8091826,5,B000BSNIVY,love this tape i had it many years ago and wore it out was so pleased you had it in  stock,1379462400,,90,3.2857142857142856
8091827,5,B000BSNIVY,I had exercised to this a while back in Florida and was pleased to find my own copy on the internet.  The people participating in the video are of various ages and physical ability and some are shown sitting down.  You don't have to be an athlete to follow the excellent instructions.,1365206400,,284,4.4423076923076925
8091828,5,B000BSNIVY,This was a replacement video.  I've used it for a long time and really enjoy it.  I wish it would come out on a CD.,1361577600,,115,3.56
8091829,3,B000BSNIVY,"Overall, Prime Time Fitness is a  pretty fair workout.  I was a little annoyed with the leader's somewhat gabby, drill-sergeant leadership.",1357689600,,139,5.571428571428571
8091830,4,B000BSNIVY,"I have been using this video 3 times a week for the last 3 months and am very pleased with the results.  I still find the workout to be a challenge, so am not tired of it as yet.  I like how it combines stretches, flexibility, aerobics, and strength training all in one video, so that I don't have to change tapes.  As a 63 year old, I also appreciate the combination of standing and sitting exercises. I would recommend this to a friend if they don't mind being taken back into the 90's world.  Three friends and I work out together which probably helps us stay committed to our workout.",1354579200,,588,4.27027027027027
