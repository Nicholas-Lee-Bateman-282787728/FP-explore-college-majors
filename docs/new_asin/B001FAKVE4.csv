8301466,5,B001FAKVE4,"Hi,  I purchased this dvd as a gift for my Mom, who loves these old movies.  She use to have lot's of them on vhs, but is now trying to replace them with dvd's.  I found this one, which was a combination of both Abbott & Costello and Laurel & Hardy movies.  It has two movies of each one, for a total of four different movies.  Of course, they are in black and white, except for one Abbott & Costello movie which is in color.  But, my Mom doesn't mind because that's the way she saw them originally.  She really enjoys seeing these old movies, and this was a great find for her collection.  A great dvd collection!",1424822400,,614,4.1440677966101696
