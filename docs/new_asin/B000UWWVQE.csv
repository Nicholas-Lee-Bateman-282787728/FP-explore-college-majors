Every time I watch it, it just resonates all the more how the choices made in a crisis pregnancy will affect these women for the rest of their lives .  If I could pick only one DVD on this subject, ""Crossroads of the Heart"" would be it.  Having volunteered as a Crisis Pregnancy Counselor for three years, I frequently utilized this resource. The testimonies in this 20 minute presentation changed the hearts and minds of many a woman who were considering abortion, and helped them realize that there were viable alternatives other than abortion.",1437004800,,587,4.745098039215686
