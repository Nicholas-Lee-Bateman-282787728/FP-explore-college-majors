8610047,2,B00EWJ3ZL6,"Inept on almost every level, The Alien Within is a disjointed mess pieced together from an earlier botched attempt at making a sci-fi flick (Evil Spawn).  It's a tossup as to which one is worth watching as they share most of the same scenes.  I watched The Alien Within, avoiding the almost duplicate version offered up as a bonus feature.  The primary film/remake deals with a vain actress of a certain age desperate to get a starring role in a film no one wants her to appear in.  She's offered injections of a magic youth serum and soon finds herself morphing into a monster when she gets very-very-very angry.  Sadly, it takes forever before this happens.  In the meantime, we're mistreated to her whining about her age and THE role of a lifetime.  To help while away the time waiting for the alien within to show up, there are many gratuitous scenes of nude women swimming and showering.  Cleanliness is next to Godliness!  There are also an inordinate number of scenes showing PIs watching her place.  As for the dialog, here's a sample.  ""You're only as young as the girl you feel.""

While it was amusing (to a degree) to watch something this bad, it's not something I'd care to subject myself to a second time.

It boggles the mind that they had two opportunities to get this movie ""right"" yet messed it up both times.",1429833600,2,1326,4.567796610169491
