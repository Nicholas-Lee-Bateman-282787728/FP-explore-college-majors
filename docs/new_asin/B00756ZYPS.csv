Though PERSUASION is not the most endearing of Jane Austen's novels, is is one of the most sincerely penned, written during Austen's final illness in the early nineteenth century.  Even though Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds lack the pysical appeal distinctive in other Austen adaptations, Root and Hinds true beauty is revealed in the gamut of suppressed emotions that are often expressed without dialouge. Of the two film adaptations, the 1995 version is my personal favorite. PERSUASION brands Jane Austen's literary career as The Winter's Tale does in Shakespear's. It is a bittersweet, autumnal drama of love lost with the enchanting and unexpected reward of a woman's second chance for happiness.

The story centers on Amanda Root and Ciran Hinds as Anne and Wentworth, the star-crossed lover. Bearing a perpetual expression of anguished resignation, Ms. Root is brilliant at portraying Anne as sad but never self-pitying. The heroine Anne refused an offer of marriage and true love at the tender age of nineteen, persuaded by a trusted family friend, Lady Russell, who convinced Anne that a penniless naval officer was not the appropriate match for the daughter of a wealthy baronet.

Fast forward eight years when Anne is now twenty-seven, a plain, thin-lipped woman on the verge of spinsterhood and Wentworth has returned to the village as a wealthy seacaptain who made his fortune during the war. With heart-wrenching emotions, Anne endures the parade of endless women who are now vying for Captain Wentworth's hand in marriage, a hand she still desperately wants but fears her time for happiness to the man she loves has now passed.",1328227200,,1681,5.124087591240876
