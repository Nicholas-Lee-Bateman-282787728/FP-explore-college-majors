355344,5,630178216X,"The Man From Utah, 1934 film

The story starts with a man on a white horse singing and strumming a guitar. [No case or bg for it?] A sign asks for men to fight a fire in a national forest. But the Marshal says the offer has ended. There is gunshots from three men who leave the ""Wells Fargo Express Company"", the Marshal shoots at them. [No warnings?] One of the robbers climbs a roof, then falls to the ground. The stranger fires to halt the other robbers, then races away. [Was that a stunt double? Was a rope used to trip the white horse?] The Marshal has a job for him: the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Is this a rigged contest? Spike, the gang leader, plans on more big job. They will place an agent on the stagecoach so she provides information. The Marshal sends John Watson on his way.

Miss Carter returns for the big round-up. Another woman enters this stagecoach. She waves a handkerchief. Four men race after the stagecoach shooting at it. Weston knocks off the last riders to stop the robbery attempt. Spike plans to take care of Weston. Judge Carter wants the Rodeo to be on the level. People invested all their money in the Rodeo in hopes of bringing prosperity to the valley. [A reference to the Great Depression?] Judge Carter offers the job of Deputy Sheriff to Weston, but he refuses. ""I think he's nice."" The movie shows scenes of a real rodeo from a big town. Native Americans walk and ride as part of the parade. [Are those feathered bonnets authentic?] Rodeos celebrate the work activities used in cattle ranching; they were not show business. The trick roping looks easy. ""Roman"" riding is modern. ""The Man from Utah"" sets a new record! Weston is told that girl from the stagecoach is part of that gang. There is a stagecoach race. Weston goes off with that stagecoach girl. Miss Carter is disappointed.

Weston meets Cheyene Kent. Suddenly men enter the room, the lamp is extinguished, there is a noisy struggle. ""He got away!"" Weston tells what happened to the Sheriff. Utah collects his prize money. [The money values date this movie.] Weston bets $1,000 on himself to win. Barton talks to Weston, asking him to join the gang. He will gain more money if he is ""off his form"". Weston increases his bet. Weston tells the Marshal about what happened. The second day of the rodeo starts. We see the Indians dance. Next the bulldogging event. Weston wins in eleven seconds! Weston finds the needle stuck in his saddle. The Dalton gang prepares their last robbery. Weston wins again. He is told about the bank robbery in town, and stops it. The US Marshal explains it to the Sheriff. They need to catch the robbers. There is a chase. Weston nabs the boss of the gang. The Marshal explains things to Miss Carter. Weston has plans for his future.

The location of that real rodeo is not mentioned, but it is likely to be in southern California. Note the use of doubles for the rodeo events. This is another morality play that warns the audience against gambling on fixed events. Decades ago there used to be a yearly carnival in many small cities along the east coast, the equivalent f rodeos out west. They went out of business in the 1960s (as I remember).",1375574400,,3169,4.544658493870402
355345,2,630178216X,"<strong>The Man from Utah</strong> (Robert N. Bradbury, 1935)

One of the many, many two-reel westerns Robert N. Bradbury directed for Lone Star Pictures featuring a young John Wayne, a young Yakima Canutt, and Gabby Hayes, who was never young. I've watched quite a few of these over the past few years, and I often refrain from reviewing them (I review all features, but very few shorts, and my personal line for that division is sixty minutes), but this one being of average quality, I figured I'd use it as an indicator for much of the batch (and for the pictures Wayne and various other members of this band of merry men were also making for Republic Pictures at the same time).

The plot is pretty generic, as far as John Wayne Lone Star westerns are concerned: Wayne plays John Weston, a rodeo star sent underocver by the U. S. Marshals (bet you can't guess what state he's from!) to investigate corruption in the annual rodeo in a small Arizona town. Seems every time someone from out of town looks like they're about to win the top prize, they end up dead, and the Marshals want to know why. Things get more complex when a pair of outlaws rob the safe containing the prize money, and Weston, having discovered the crime, is walked in on and immediately assumed to be the thief.

Nothing here out of the ordinary--Wayne gets a chance to show off some of his trick riding skills (though obvious body doubles are used for some shots for both Wayne and Canutt), the criminals are dunderheads, the good guy wins in the end. If you're a fan of the genre, this will work for you. If you're not, it won't. Simple. **",1335484800,,1616,4.508532423208191
355346,2,630178216X,"Here's your chance to see John Wayne when he was a B movie maker, churning out 5 to 10 forgettable films a year with titles like ""Born Reckless"" (1930), ""Arizona"" (1931), ""Texas Cyclone"" (1932), etc. Then in 1939 he made ""Stagecoach"" with John Ford, and his new career as a star began.  Stagecoach earned 5 Oscars including Best Picture. Wayne followed up with  ""Dark Command"" (1940) directed by Raoul Walsh, and  then a series of war movies (e.g.,  ""Flying Tigers"" in 1942, ""The Fighting Seabees""  in 1944, ""Back to Bataan"" and ""They Were Expendable"" in 1945) and his classic westerns including ""3 Godfathers"" (1948),  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949, ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), and ""The Alamo"" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and he would finally earn an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969).

This was the 6th of 16 films Wayne made with Monogram/Lone Star Pictures. Monogram churned out films by the month, usually in the summer, with little attention to detail or character development. Wayne said - ""For any actor trying to get on in the business, working at Monogram was not a good career move. Most of the contract players there may have had regular work, but they generally didn't move up from there into the major studios - they went down and that's the direction I thought I was headed.""

Wayne plays a drifter looking for work, who is hired by the local sheriff as an  undercover rodeo rider sent out to discover who is killing fellow rodeo riders.

The film starts with Wayne riding a white horse and singing while playing the guitar, but it's not Wayne's voice. Wayne hated being portrayed as a ""singing"" cowboy because it made him feel like a ""pansy"" and he knew this relegated him to B status forever. Near the end of his career with Lone Star he refused any more singing roles.

In 1934 alone, when this film was made, Wayne made 9 films, all of them westerns. All but one included George ""Gabby"" Hayes"" who was Wayne's sidekick in dozens of films from 1933 (""Riders of Destiny"") to 1935 (""Rainbow Valley"") when Hayes moved on to partner with Hopalong Cassidy and later with Roy Rogers and then Gene Autry.  Hayes (1885-1969) made nearly 200 films between 1929 and 1950.

In this film, as in many of them, Hayes plays the local Marshall. At this point Hayes had not yet grown the scrubby beard his character ""Gabby"" was famous for, but he does have a few days worth of stubble.

Wayne's  long time mentor, stunt man, double, and good friend, Yakima Canutt (1895-1986) is along for the ride. They first worked together on ""The Shadow of the Eagle"" (1932) and made dozens of films together. As Canutt became more hobbled from injuries, he turned to directing and had a successful career as a second unit director handling action scenes.  Wayne gave him his first chance in ""Dark Command"" (1940). He went on to work on films such as ""Ivanhoe"", ""Spartacus"" ""El Cid"" and ""Ben Hur"".

Wayne's female co-star is Polly Ann Young (1908-97), the sister of much more famous Loretta Young. In fact, Wayne had dated Polly Ann and this is how he got to meet Loretta, with whom he later co-starred. Polly made 34 films, mostly forgettable, of which this was her most prominent role. She plays a Judge's daughter.

The bad guy is played by Edward Peil Sr. (1883-1958) who often played the bad guy in these films. Peil appeared in more than 400 films, mostly in uncredited roles.

The film was directed by Robert Bradbury (1886-1949), who was the father of another 30s western star, Bob Steele (1907-1988), who was a good friend of Wayne from his USC years (Wayne and Steel appeared in 6 films together between 1953 and 1970). Bradbury's other son, Bob's twin, dubbed the songs Wayne sung in the Monogram films (and he used the money he made to pay for medical school). Bradbury made more than 100 films between and 1918 and 1941

FWIW - Bradbury's 1926 silent film ""Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo"" was Wayne's inspiration for his own 1960 Alamo film which he directed and in which he starred.

1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" and ""It Happened One Night"" was the big Oscar winner. That year ""The Thin Man"" series began, Karloff and Lugosi appeared in ""The Black Cat"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in ""The Gay Divorcee"", Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in ""Babes in Toyland"", and Howard Hawks' ""Twentieth Century"" came out. There were no real major league westerns apart from the oat burners produced by Lone Star, but westerns were popular in serials, such as ""The Red Rider"" starring Buck Jones and ""The Law of the Wild"" starring Rin Tin Tin.

There's not much to see here except for historians of the western film and for people curious enough to wonder how ""Gabby"" Hayes looked before he grew his beard. Of course, stunts by Canutt in his young days are always good to see, and personally I never get tired of the young John Wayne.",1307318400,,5015,4.636568848758465

355349,4,630178216X,"I quite enjoyed The Man From Utah (1934), but it is a rather peculiar old western.  John Wayne plays John Weston, a stranger who rides into town, saves the local marshal's life in the aftermath of a bank robbery, and soon finds himself entering a rodeo as an undercover detective of sorts.  It seems that the rodeo organizer's boys keep winning all the prize money at each event, while outsider entrants who have a chance to win keep getting ""snakebit,"" literally.  It's up to The Duke to infiltrate the gang, figure out how they operate, and save the day.  There is a good bit of rodeo action, but a significant portion of it comes from stock footage used in a good number of other early films; this is clearly a mark against The Man From Utah, but it is an understandable way to make a cheap movie back in depression-marked 1934.  If you haven't seen the footage elsewhere, it won't matter at all to you.  What really distinguishes this film is the music.  The movie opens with John Wayne riding into town strumming a guitar and singing; I believe this is stock footage of someone other than The Duke, though.  What really got me, though, was the insertion at times, usually during a chase scene, of unusually prominent music consisting mainly of organs and horns (at least, that's what it sounded like to me).  I suppose this was done to add tension or excitement to important parts of the film, but the sound of quasi-classical music coming from out of nowhere during an old western really struck me as quite odd.  The Man From Utah does have its problems, but it still features John Wayne playing the hero as only he can; this and the presence of the always entertaining Gabby Hayes make this an entertaining old western that all fans of The Duke should enjoy.",1051833600,7,1765,4.556962025316456

This is from the earlier John Wayne movie, West of the Divide, and the picture on the poster is Wayne as Gann? Apparently an inside joke on these quickies.
