1622888,5,B00005LQ19,"This is my favorite tape. It combines moves from yoga, Pilates, dance, and tai chi in a fast moving routine, so your heart rate is raised and you break a sweat. When it is over you feel the benefits of both the aerobic quality and the strengthening and toning, and best of all, you also reap the mind/body rewards of some wonderful tai-chi and yoga.  I'm in decent shape and have experience with yoga and pilates, and found this tape to be challenging and interesting.  I love it.  You might want to start with some beginning yoga and pilates if you are not familiar with the correct form for these excercises.  the only fault with this tape is that it is assumed that the user already has had some experience with the disciplines that the tape draws on.",1017705600,,754,4.442028985507246
1622889,3,B00005LQ19,"I have been practicing yoga for three years now and wanted to try something for when I can't get to or don't have class. I would not recommend this tape to a beginner or to anyone who is not already in fairly good shape.
I borrowed this tape from my library. I watched it all the way through the first time. I always do this and with yoga tapes as you will be bending and turning and can not always see the instructor, which if they don't give excellent instructions, this instructor does not, it will be disruptive to your workout. I immediately disliked the super fit instructer and students, not a single one looks like an average person, but thought that it looked like a pretty simple and easy workout. Once I actually did the workout I found it to be more difficult because you are always moving, which was good, it is definately a Power Yoga type of workout. But, I did not like how you couldn't always see the person who was suppose to be doing the modification. They often only showed her after they had started the exercise and she didn't always do a modification.
Overall I did enjoy the tape it gave me a very different type of workout then my yoga class (more aerobic), and because I am already practicing yoga and pilates I felt comfortable doing almost all of the moves. But I must state again this is not for beginners in yoga or fitness the moves are to hard with little instruction and few modifications which could cause an experienced person to injure theirselves.",1014940800,7,1484,4.459558823529412
7944184,5,B00005LQ19,It's hard yes!  But even as a beginner u can start and every time you do it get stronger.  Love it!  How can I get a DVD?????????,1463356800,,129,3.7037037037037037
7944185,5,B00005LQ19,I have this tape and wish it would come in DVD.  I love the instructor and all the poses.,1455494400,,89,3.6842105263157894
7944186,5,B00005LQ19,I used this tape for 2.5 years almost everyday. In the beginning I thought I would expire trying to hold these poses. The pilates was perfect for this beginner and it leaves you feeling relaxed. I was in the best shape of my life. I always go back to it if I've let myself go to long and quickly see toning. My husband also loves it! The reason why I'm reviewing it is because my VHS s broken and I wanted a DVD. My husband is begging me to find a copy. I think the people who just watched it should have tried it for a week and would have been shocked.,1395360000,,553,3.9464285714285716
7944187,4,B00005LQ19,"Because this incorporated Pilates, which I like, as well as dance movements this workout was fun. It didn't even feel like a work out so much as a stretching routine. I never really understood just how inflexible I was until attempting this workout; I felt so stretched out afterwards, it felt great. I agree however, that I had to look up at the TV alot, which can be stressful on the neck, to understand how to do some of the movements.",1328486400,,438,4.419753086419753
7944188,5,B00005LQ19,"I've used this tape (now DVD) for several years in combination with walking/jogging and have experienced satisfying results.  Not only am I more limber, but I've developed long and lean muscles.  I've taken years of yoga and dance, and feel that this tape is a pretty good combination of strength, stretch and balance.  I've even brought it with me on vacation, because I think it's a nice way to start off the day!",1204588800,,415,4.657534246575342
7944189,5,B00005LQ19,"I do agree with one reviewer that this video does not give enough instruction with the pilates section. The pilates section is (in my humble opinion) high intermediate/advanced. Beginners beware! There's not enough modification presented! The yoga portion was a lot of fun, flowed well, but was not too difficult. I think the entire video flows very well. The best part is that my butt and abs get a great workout. I even feel it the next day. If you're looking to work up a sweat building strenth in the lower body, this is for you!",1110153600,2,533,4.5625
7944190,4,B00005LQ19,"This tape was definitely more effective than I imagined it would be. I perspired (the heater was on, but that wasn't the only reason, I'm sure) and felt challenged but not tortured. The combination of pilates, yoga, dance, etc. really made the workout very fluid and non-work-out like...it went much faster because she moved on to one exercise after another...and I didn't feel any particular move was overdone.
Overall...effective workout. Much better than I had anticipated.",1071273600,3,476,5.276315789473684
7944191,4,B00005LQ19,"The first part of this video does a good job of blending dance, qi gong, yoga, and traditional strength moves into a 25 min cardio workout.  It does help to have some familiarity with yoga, but her instruction is fine and she doesn't move quickly at all.  Teigh begins with some dancey, qi-gong like warmups and then moves into sun salutations that work up a sweat, challenging flexibility and strength.  I find this part of the workout really enjoyable; it reminds me of 3-Dimensional Toning with no ballet and more yoga.  However, the pilates core segment that follows is horrible.  She does not give enough instruction or guidance on the proper form, and a beginner attempting to follow her onscreen moves will likely hurt him/herself; also, for some idiotic reason, the one who is supposed to be demonstrating modifications isn't.  Why have someone doing modifications for some exercises and not for others?!  Fortunately, this lasts for only five minutes.  (For someone who isn't familiar with pilates, I highly recommend reading ""The Pilates Body"" or viewing an instructional pilates tape before attempting to do this portion of the video -- or just fast forward.)  She redeems the workout with some punishing hamstring/gluteal work and leg exercises that are almost as difficult; a fine series of stretches follows.  I really like this tape, but can't ignore the terrible lack of instruction during the pilates segment.",1019174400,4,1426,5.081545064377682
7944192,3,B00005LQ19,"I have been doing yoga for several years and own approximately 10 videos.  This reminds me of a Jane Fonda aerobics video gone modern.  For practioners wanting to reap the relaxation/flexibility benefits of Yoga, you will NOT find it here.  This video serves as a mild workout, great to energize you for the day.  It does not concentrate on breathing.  Poses are held for short periods of time and not very advanced.  It does offer a ""less advanced"" option to the poses.  I am giving this a three rating because of the ab workout towards the end of the video; which is its only redeeming quality!",1017878400,4,596,4.566037735849057
