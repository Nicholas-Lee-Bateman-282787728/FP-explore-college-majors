752094,3,6303982662,"This movie was extremely funny. Made as a retort to all the flak he recieved for the John Hinkley Shooting for Jodie Foster. Jerry Lewis Playing the straight man is more funny that it should be, and DeNiro is  simply fantastic, a sleeper hit! my advice is rent it, it's not for all  tastes.",932860800,2,290,4.351851851851852
752095,5,6303982662,"The King of Comedy brings to light the jolting realization that we are so enamored of celebrity that we are willing to endanger or even destroy the objects of our admiration. It is a fable for our age that reveals the  darkness in anyone who worships celebrity and craves its embrace. It is  both hard and a delight to watch. And it is simply one of the best films  ever made.
Robert DeNiro's portrayal of Rupert Pupkin, a would-be  comedian, is masterful, and Martin Scorcese's directorial skill is  remarkable by the illusion that it is absent in this film. DeNiro and the  other characters glide effortlessly through each scene, as though they were  subjects in a documentary, their behavior unaltered by the presence of a  director. Jerry Lewis is absolutely stunning as the big-time celebrity who  is warm and appealing on the screen but cold and abrupt off. He lives in a  hardened shell and is accustomed to pushing away the irritating fan who  wants to get a bit too close. For him, it's a strategy for  survival.
Pupkin pursues the opportunity to appear on his idol's  television show to the point of committing a serious crime. He stalks the  Lewis character tirelessly, but not unlike what many celebrities would say  they have experienced with some of their fans. What is disturbing about  Pupkin is that his private world, his fantasies and his role-playing spill  over so easily into his public persona. He is convinced he is a great  entertainer, yet DeNiro is brilliant enough to show us that he modestly  talented but not destined for the big time. And never does one get the  impression that Pupkin understands that his behavior is inappropriate, not  even when his hero, played by Jerry Lewis, turns him out with rebuffs  blistering enough to wilt the adoration of the most admiring fan. Fame  often isolates the famous, even as it captivates those who pursue it, and  that dynamic is illustrated poignantly in the brief encounters between the  characters played by DeNiro and Lewis.
Pupkin is determined to become a  famous comedian, not by working the clubs and scrapping for gigs, but by  entering the celebrity world fully formed, a ready-made star who bypassed  the years of one-nighters, the comedy club amateur nights or the gnawing  doubts about his talents.
Pupkin is in a sense a sharp departure from  Travis Bickle, a character made famous by Scorcese and DeNiro in the film  Taxi Driver. But in another crucial respect Bickle and Pupkin are  chillingly similar. Both have a view of their relative importance that far  outstrips their authentic relevance. Both are willing to engage in  progressively antisocial behavior to achieve their ends. And while Pupkin  is superficially polite and restrained, his determination will no doubt  push him to act out in an antisocial manner.
This film is in such  contrast to what we have come to expect from Scorcese and DeNiro that I am  afraid it never will be fully appreciated. But it deserves to be seen.  Anyone who hasn't seen it should make it a point to do so.",929404800,,3038,4.813953488372093
752096,4,6303982662,"3. THE KING OF COMEDY (comedy, 1983) Rupert Pupkin (Robert DeNiro) is a struggling stand-up comic in NY. He constantly daydreams on appearing on the hottest show in town (""The Jerry Langford Show""), and meeting  its host, Jerry  (Jerry Lewis). Rupert is optimistic on everything he does.  He rehearses his acts in the basement of his mother's house, whilst  pretending to be on the show. Besides honing his comedic skills, he spends  his time impressing high-school sweetheart Rita, now a disillusioned  bartender. Along with Masha, a ""supremo"" Jerry fan, they engineer  a plan by which to meet and convince Jerry into letting him appear on the  show. Nevertheless, Jerry ignores him as another crackpot. Rupert, however,  remains undaunted in his efforts and looks for other ways to display his  talent.
Critique: Robert DeNiro's long and successful partnership with  director Martin Scorcese has produced some of the best films of the last  decades. In their films, DeNiro usually plays dark and disturbed loners  whose volatile nature makes them a threat. Therefore, it comes as a  pleasant surprise to find in the Scorcese-DeNiro oeuvre The King of Comedy,  their first venture into comedy. While DeNiro's Rupert Pupkin is still a  lone-loser, his characterization is faultless. The major asset of the film  though is Jerry Lewis, as a David Letterman-type icon. After years of  playing the sidekick idiot to Dean Martin (as well as countless  ""child"" comedies), Lewis for the first time plays it straight.  His embittered, show-biz-like personage brings to the film a reality that  is essential to its theme. His performance has left me wondering where his  acting awards have gone.
QUOTES: Rupert: ""Better to be king for a  night than schmuck for a lifetime.""",917913600,,1765,5.137323943661972
752246,4,6303982662,"This under appreciated Scorcese film takes a dark look at game and fandom. Jerry Lewis gives a great serious performance as a talk show host a la Carson or Merv Griffin. De Niro plays a psychotic hell bent on performing a televised stand up comedy act.

Sandra Bernhard gives a crazed no holds barred performance as a deeply troubled young lady.  There are guest spots by Tony Randall, Liza Minnelli, and others. The film captures New York perfectly in the early 1980s with his locations.

Special features include the trailer, interviews with cast and crew and additional/extended scenes.

This movie was made more brilliant after I watched the documentary about the Gong Show winner Johnny Blaze. This movie is definitely not for someone looking for something funny to watch. This is more of a caricature of more people than you realize, talk shows are littered with these people looking for their 15 minutes of fame. As of this writing we see people on the news every day similar to Rupert Pupkin but they are using a gun to draw attention to themselves. When you have a society that puts fame at the apex of existence you will have a culture that has Judge Judy making $43 million a year, a nursing assistant helping your grandmother making $10 an hour and gunmen slaughtering innocent people.

752251,5,6303982662,"Jerry Lewis' recent death set me to thinking about this cockeyed classic, which under director Martin Scorsese takes the old American success story and wrings postmodernism out of it.  Robert DeNiro plays Rupert Pupkin, loser, who thinks he has the ""stuff"" to become a late-night TV host.  Sandra Bernhard is his domineering and emotionally labile girlfriend who usually thinks violence is the way to solve a problem.  Jerry Lewis himself is the late-night talk show host with the long-established program (with Ed Herlihy as sidekick, a nice bit of casting).  The results are ironic, violent, brilliantly overacted and often quite funny.

In the movie, DeNiro and Bernhard kidnap Jerry Lewis character (using a fake gun) and tape him to a chair.  (And in a very Jerry Lewis kind of way, they use so much tape that hes covered in tape up to his neck.)  But he escapes.

How does Jerry escape???  While DeNiro is gone to make his TV appearance, Sandra Bernhard decides that she wants to make crazy love to Jerry on the dinner table.  Jerry pretends to go along with her plans and tells her to take off the tape.  Bernhard cuts the tape and Jerry grabs the fake gun, shoots her with rubber bullets and then hits her, knocking her out and then he walks out of the building.

752756,5,6303982662,"I'll never forget the first time I saw The King of Comedy in 1983. I was in Manhattan, and sat alone in anticipation of this film, knowing something of what to expect but not fully prepared for the stunning, overpowering experience on the screen. I squirmed with discomfort as two delusional fans of a talk show host refuse to acknowledge the reality of rejection that is heaped upon them by the object of their devotion and the maddeningly obvious isolation of their actual lives (such as they are.)

View your reaction to this pining for any brush with fame to Jerry Lewis' walk down the street along side the  mobs of construction workers, tourists, people on pay phones and even a cab driver vie for his attention. The audience is uncomfortable to see this adoration, clearly because it reflects us, as a society -- but we can also see it through the eyes of Jerry Lewis. Every frame brings greater uneasiness, to the point that I ache with psychological pain. It's important to note that Sandra Bernhardt steals every scene with a raw portrayal of a celebrity stalker. Either Jerry Lewis is the greatest actor in the world, or he was genuinely terrified of Bernhardt's behaviors.

Is this Scorsese film a glimpse into reality? Turn on your television and realize that any wannabe of lower talents than a Pupkin can achieve fame. Even a pretense of talent is no longer required. But the American public will always be standing by ready to proclaim, ""I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you, come rain or come shine.""

752758,5,6303982662,"The King of Comedy is a black comedy that features Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis.

Rupert believes he can become successful in the future. He attempts to get a place on the show but is continually rebuffed by Langford's staff and, finally, by Langford himself. In the end,Pupkin ultimately kidnaps Langford, demanding, as ransom, a chance to appear on his television show. The film focuses on themes of celebrity worship and American media culture. It was written by Paul D. Zimmerman and directed by Martin Scorsese.

This is definitely one of the best films ever released during the 1980's. We get to see a fine performance from DeNiro as psycho and talk show wannabe while Jerry Lewis gives great performance.

752760,1,6303982662,"I couldn't resist. Having played a lot of tough-type characters in his movies, DeNiro tried to play against type in this movie, playing a mope who wants to be a big-time comedian. Whether playing this role was on DeNiro's own initiative, or whether he was pushed into it, his performance was so bad, I couldn't believe that I was watching a major Hollywood star.

My mother and I bailed after 20 minutes, not only because she and I were both so shocked at DeNiro's terrible performance, but there was nothing else worth seeing, just overlong scenes with a lot of jabber and not much else. And neither of us are really Jerry Lewis fans, so it was just as well we didn't stay for him.

Yes, DeNiro's character was supposed to be a mope. But even a mope should give the viewer a reason to take interest in him. DeNiro didn't look like a mope, he looked like a hack actor trying to play a mope.

752879,4,6303982662,"This film deserves most of the praise heaped on it. But there's a worm in the apple, and it should be pointed out. At some stage in every Scorcese film, I find myself getting agitated. Something is rotten, and when I dissect my reaction, the answer is that the film has no moral sense. In the interests of whatever reaction he is pursuing, Scorcese reveals a stunning poverty of character. This analysis is at odds, of course, with the generous spirit the man projects in his public presences. But the rot is there in his films. In King of Comedy, he paints the picture of a man with vile values. We laugh at Pupkin, and then Scorcese leads us to embrace him and enjoy his victory over the powers of show business. The same thing happens in the recent Wolves of Wall Street. In the interests of making DiCaprio's character a delight, which it is, we are led to enjoy his excesses and ignore his more troubling evils. Even one shot showing the actual impact of this character on the life of a struggling retiree he defrauded would have burst the bubble. Scorcese always stacks the deck in a way that gives his slime-bag protagonists the ability to remain the center of good and retain the viewer's empathy. The most obnoxious example of this is Gangs of New York, where the viewer is encouraged, by virtue of the emotional dynamics of the film, to internalize the racial bigotry motivating the film's central characters. With Scorcese, right and wrong don't count for much. This is what we might expect from a director who made the glorification of gangsters a key to his early film successes. In those films, he followed the path trod by Hollywood in the 40s. He improved on their formula, however, by removing the moral veneer, allowing us to enjoy depictions of brutality, like Pesce's in Goodfellas, as pure entertainment.",1417132800,,1825,4.670807453416149

753009,4,6303982662,"""The King of Comedy"" (1982) isn't itself a comedy.  Rather, it's an anatomy of a cultural disorder, and it presents that disorder with a prescience that's amazing, for in our 2014 world of ""reality"" TV we see made manifest what Paul Zimmerman's script (written in the 1970's) seems to be getting at -- that part of our attraction to or fixation with ""celebrity"" is a kind of illness: it comes to seem to us that to be publicly acknowledged as existing can blind us to what would normally seem shameful or embarrassing in our own behavior and seems to require a degree of violence of self-assertion in compensation for manifest inadequacies in our lives.  There's a tendency to force ourselves upon people in a certain way as a way of insisting on our own interestingness to ourselves.  The narrative trope in the movie for this ""forcing"" is Rupert Pupkin's (Robert de Niro) insistence on violating spatial boundaries of office and home, and the scenes in which he does are funny up to a point -- there's a perverse ingenuity to his persistence -- but beyond that point they become embarrassing (to the audience) because, in part, he remains so resolutely unembarrassed.  The idea of his own life as inadequate is something he never admits to himself, even though he seems to have no job and to live in his mother's basement with a mock-up of the set of ""The Jerry Langford Show"" on which he acts out fantasies of appearances on that show, and it seems that such an appearance would give his life meaning.  So he kidnaps Langford (Jerry Lewis), with the demand to be put on the show as a condition of Langford's release -- and he succeeds, though he ends up in jail.  What happens after his jailing is ambiguous, because we're not sure whether or not it constitutes a degree of fame or a mere fantasy of fame -- we're not sure because earlier in the movie some of Rupert's fantasies have been presented as just part of the narrative, with no distinctive visual signaling.  Either way, though, what he achieves seems trivial -- at ""best"" he's just recognized because he's recognizable, not because of any talent.

Pupkin's partner in fantasy is Masha (Sandra Bernhard) -- also, it seems, without a life beyond her fixation with Langford, although her family's circumstances seem a bit more socially elevated than Rupert's.  The apartment or house (her parents'?) in which the kidnapped Langford is held is very well-appointed and elegant.  Her fixation is different from Rupert's and consists in the idea that she could be interesting to Langford as a person and perhaps as a woman.  It's an illusion of intimacy, rather than publicity, that she craves.  The intimate scene -- which takes place while Rupert is performing on Langford's show (guest-hosted that evening by Tony Randall) -- is funny, pathetic, and cruel, and we see nothing of her life after that scene to suggest that it did anything for her.

The easy thing to say is that both Rupert and Masha are psychologically disturbed -- and they are.  But we see supposedly ""normal"" fans of Langford accosting him or mobbing him, or screaming for his touch or an autograph, and we wonder if Rupert and Masha aren't basically on the same scale as they are, but just a little further along.  As Jerry Lewis's fine performance makes clear, there's nothing to Langford EXCEPT his fame -- nothing humanly engaging or interesting -- and yet his being in the public eye seems to be what makes him an object of veneration.  He's ""famous for being famous,"" as they say.  But that's an empty condition, and it's disturbing that something that empty can seem that attractive to so many.

De Niro, Bernhard, and Lewis are all fine.  They know what this is about -- indeed, de Niro was fascinated by the script for years before the movie was made.  The pacing seems right, and the scenes that are extended to the point of discomfort are extended deliberately for that effect.  It's an odd movie, but it might be that Travis Bickle and Rupert aren't all that far apart. Fantasies of acceptance that end up being of questionable worth are perhaps common to both.  The culture of celebrity plays to our culture of narcissism.",1409529600,,4164,4.730290456431535

753232,4,6303982662,"First, some remarks about the Blu-ray release, a long time in coming. The video transfer is quite good. Audio is monaural but remixed to DTS-HD. It's a very high quality rendition of the monaural you would have heard in the theater. The scenes showing the broadcast TV program are quite soft. That was intentional in the original filming. Scorsese deliberately filmed those scenes using the low fidelity videotaping systems used for studio recording TV programs to make them realistic looking as they would have been seen in analog NTSC TV broadcasts (this film was made fifteen years before HDTV). Might not be evident on the DVD, but is quite evident on the Blu-ray as it undoubtedly was in its theatrical projection.

If you're expecting the typical Jerry Lewis slapstick, move on. There isn't any of it in this film. Aside from a couple lines of talk show host monologue he plays a completely straight non-comedic role and does an excellent job of it. It's blatantly obvious his character (Jerry Langdon) is portraying Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show. (For those too young to remember, Carson was Jay Leno's predecessor). He should have received more recognition for it. Sandra Bernhardt is nearly over the top with her portrayal of a manic obsessive. IMO it's deliberate to provide sufficient contrast with Pupkin's (De Niro's) obsession. Robert De Niro is completely immersed in his role and plays it with his usual mastery throughout. The magnitude of his role compared to the rest of the cast dominates the story, its limited action and its dialogue. His skill as an actor clearly shows and he carries the film.

The very dark comedy and its style is atypical of Scorsese. It's a significant departure from three previous film collaborations with De Niro: Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. (New York, New York with De Niro and Liza Minnelli is a different departure in a musical.) I found De Niro's character, Rupert Pupkin, almost painfully embarrassing to watch at times. I wanted to feel some sympathy for his pathetic bumbling life filled with delusions, but it's impossible as he's also an obsessively obnoxious jerk oblivious to how he's continuously humiliating himself without any respite for the entire film. I was left at the end feeling this was deliberate on the part of Scorsese, that he didn't want Pupkin to have anyone's sympathy. The discomfort I felt regarding Pupkin during the first 2/3rds of the film eventually gave way to the absurdity of his self-destructive actions, and if ""Greatness"" wasn't possible he was going down in a blaze of ""Glory"" which he does quite dramatically. Even then, at the very end, he still cannot give up his lesser obsession with the barmaid (a high school acquaintance) and his delusions of greatness.

Overall, well done by Scorsese and the principal actors and actresses. Don't expect the norm though for Scorsese, Lewis or De Niro.",1395878400,6,2904,4.97119341563786

The film, like many of Scorsese's films, stars Robert De Niro as Rupert Pupkin, a deranged obsessed fan of famous comedian Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), who plays a more serious role here than his usual stuff. It's somewhat odd as Robert De Niro is so well known for his dramatic roles and here he plays a comedic role while an actor known for comedic roles plays a more straight, serious role. This film had me in hysterics, laughing constantly, but it was also quite disturbing and even a bit depressing in some scenes. I'll admit that it wasn't as dark as some other comedies like Happiness, God Bless America and Very Bad Things, but I loved it just the same, as those films are a bit too dark for my tastes. Rounding out the cast are Sandra Bernhard as another obsessed fan named Masha, who's crazier, and almost as funny, as Rupert is. This film takes a rather dark look at American society and how obsessed we are with celebrities and Hollywood, when in any normal healthy society we would be more focused on the innovators and intellectuals such as scientists, inventors, and philosophers who change society for the better and make it a better place to live. In this regard it also slightly reminds me of God Bless America, although this film is much better than that one for many reasons. I highly recommend you watch this film for a dark but hilarious look at American society which is even more relevant today that it was back in the early 80's when this film was released.

753538,4,6303982662,"Collaborations like Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are few and far between. Together, they've created some of the greatest films of all time, including Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Goodfellas. One of their great films, however, has somehow managed to slip under the radar, into the realm of near-obscurity. That film is `The King Of Comedy'.

In `The King of Comedy', De Niro delivers a comical, yet convincing performance as the delusional yet ambitious Rupert Pumpkin, who has developed an unhealthy obsession with talk show celebrity Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) and desires, more than anything else, to be a successful stand-up comedian. In real life, Rupert is a very pathetic failure; he lives with his mother and his jokes are pretty mediocre, but he frequently escapes his undesirable reality in favor of a perfect fantasy world where everybody loves him and his awesome jokes.

Rupert constantly tries to secure a meeting with Langford, but is constantly blown-off by his secretary, who insists that his one-liners need more work. Furious, Rupert and his friend (Sandra Bernhard, another Langford stalker), kidnap Langford and hold him hostage until the show producers promise to give Pupkin a stand-up shot on the show.

In addition to being an excellent character study, The King Of Comedy is a very funny movie. As mentioned before, De Niro gives an incredibly good performance, and is probably the most funny here than he's ever been, or ever will be. In all honesty, this is De Niro's show, and if you like him, then you'll be sure to love this movie.

That isn't to say that Scorsese didn't have a major role in the film's success. His style is present, and he even makes a comical cameo appearance half-way through. Even though this may not be his most personal picture, it still has many themes familiar with his previous work, specifically Taxi Driver.
The ending of the film is particularly thought-provoking, as it is left open as to whether or not it's real or fantasy. It's all subjective as to which one it is. In my opinion, the ending is real, but someone else just might think otherwise. Overall, this is a great movie that deserves a lot more praise then it receives.",1363478400,,2200,4.874331550802139

I was disappointed in the quality of the picture and sound on the DVD release. I usually don't mind if the print is a little dated, but ""The King Of Comedy"" needs to be remastered b/c the transfer here is just awful. Blurry (and yes, it's supposed to look like a blurry broadcast at times, but not ALL the time) and VERY GRAINY. And it's a shame too, because this is a fantastic film. There are 2 deleted scenes, both Jerry Lewis scenes, with the most valuable being a deleted monologue from Lewis. Other than that, there's an 18 minute ""making-of"" documentary which is ok, but doesn't delve into De Niro, the actor, as much as I'd hoped. That's all we've got here. However, I would still encourage anyone considering it to buy this item. I don't think you'll regret it if you have an appreciation for subtle and mature humor.
  ""Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for life."" - - Rupert Pupkin is a wannabe comedian played magnificently by Robert De Niro in this often overlooked Martin Scorsese classic. If you are expecting the style of humor you would get in a modern classic like ""Dumb and Dumber"" then you should look elsewhere. There are some very funny laugh-out-loud moments in this picture, but much of the comedy is black and subtle. As almost any review of this film states, De Niro's character (Pupkin) is similar to the character he played in ""Taxi Driver"", Travis Bickle. Both characters are isolated and shunned by the world. Both characters are embarrassingly inept at achieving their goals. The 2 characters are both loners that are simply trying to get some sense of satisfaction in an otherwise distasteful life. In ""The King Of Comedy"" however, we aren't frequently presented with drama, and when we are, it's hilarious. So this is for people who enjoy a black comedy and subtle humor (maybe in other words, clean and mature adult humor). And if you love Scorsese and De Niro like I do, this was the film that they made together following ""Raging Bull"" and proceeding ""Goodfellas"" so this is right in Scorsese and De Niro's hay-day. Jerry Lewis notably stars in a supporting role and is fantastic as well. Even Sandra Bernhard is tolerable in this film. That's all thanks to Marty though.

753658,2,6303982662,"It would be easier for me to say what I don't like about this film if I felt certain as to what kind of film it was trying to be. There is bonus material on the DVD and the interview with Scorsese seems to indicate that he intended it as a comedy, perhaps a dark comedy. But it fails as a comedy, or as anything else it might be. There are funny parts, and I couldn't help but laugh at some of the more outrageous scenes, but the humor is interspersed with scenes of depressing pathos, and since the character of Rupert Pupkin is never likable, it's nearly impossible to feel any compassion for him.

What I resent the most, and what makes this film dishonest, is that we are led to believe that Rupert is, as the Amazon reviewer writes, ""horrendously untalented."" We are subjected to painfully bad one-liners to prove the point. Also, we are led to believe that Rupert is delusional, lacking the intellectual nuts and bolts necessary for a rudimentary understanding of how the world works. Rupert wants to be the King of Comedy, but he doesn't want to ""waste his time"" working in comedy clubs, or perhaps, in his egomania, he thinks he is too good for comedy clubs and insists on starting at the top? But why would someone who is willing to practice his routine for hours alone in his room, day after day, year after year, in a mock stage setting complete with sound effects, not be willing to practice his routine in live comedy clubs? And in the end - warning, this is a spoiler - just when Rupert gets his chance to do his routine on the nationally televised Jerry Langford show - the equivalent of The Tonight Show - just when we expect him to bomb in the worst way, we discover that Rupert is actually a funny, insightful, and talented comic. At the same time we discover that he does indeed have enough mental nuts and bolts not only to understand how the world works, but how to manipulate it. But still, Rupert is so unlikable that you can't cheer for his brilliant success. Of course, you can't believe it, either. A crazy boor like Rupert could never make it in the real world. There is the movie ""Revenge of the Nerds""; maybe this film should have been called ""Revenge of the Losers""?

Interestingly, on the DVD, there is a deleted scene in which Jerry Langford - Jerry Lewis - performs his opening comic routine on his TV show, and I can see why it was deleted, because it was actually not very funny, in fact, it was a little weird. Rupert's routine was much better. Maybe that was intentional? But again, throughout the entire movie we are led to believe that Rupert is a phenomenally bad comic. We are left wondering as to what Jerry makes of Rupert's success. Or maybe Rupert's TV show has replaced Jerry's? That would be funny.

I've neglected to say anything about the two lead female characters, Masha, an obsessed stalker who ""loves"" Jerry and conspires with Rupert, and Rita, Rupert's ""Queen of Comedy."" They play their roles well and add interest to the story, but they are secondary characters and add nothing significant to the plot. Rupert's ego tends to dominate this movie.",1255737600,5,3101,4.51423487544484
753659,5,6303982662,"Rupert Pupikin is no king and this is no comedy. The 34-year-old jobless narsacist has spent years honing his stand-up in mommy's cellar. This gives him the idea that he should go on Jerry Langford's--who is for all practical purposes Johnny Carson--late night network show and eventually get his own gig.

Pupkin barges into Langfor's limo one night and is given the ultimate show-biz blow off: send me a tape. Anyone else might, but Pupkin takes out his high school crush the same evening, convinced he has made it to the big time. When rebuffed, he and a cohort kidnap Langford, and Pupkin gets his fifteen minutes, then goes to jail.

This plot sounds interesting enough and it is. But what makes this movie so memorable is the viceral discomfort other people feel around Rupert and we feel watching. He walks around New York City, asking to use phones--no cells in 1983-barging where he is not wanted, and mugging for camaras that are not there. He is pushy, arrogent, and, at first, more of a local nucance than a sociopath.

Rupert is either totally oblivous to his impact on other people or simply does not care. Watch the way his date looks away from him and asks for another drink while rolling her eyes. Watch how Lengford's assistant first uses corperate manners with him, then gives a professional, stuffy rebuff when Pupkin questions her judgement. Look at the disconfort when he crashes Lengford's house. Even when Langford is undisputably livid, Pupkin does not get it.  Most people would be ashamed at invoking these reactions in people.

We all know or have encountered someone like Rupert, and the only thing worse than being embarressed for yourself is being embarressed for someone else. That involuntary tensing you feel in your body you get that just makes you want to evaporate.

That is what we experiance watching this. You want to look away but look further in. King Of Comedy in a sense is not about empathizing with Rupert--ill as he is and he is quite ill--but empathizing with all those unfortunate enough to have to deal with him. The film is such a classic due to its ability to  convey this in a viceral way and not an intellectual one.

The movie is also interesting in the way it shows how the  misfit can become quite dangerous quite quickly.

Please do not misunderstand: I am not talking about the local eccentric you meet and like for his uniqueness, his ability to say what no one else will, his different outlook.

You never know what anyone is capable of, and the village idiot can become the village menece very fast.

The ending. When Rupert gets out of jail he becomes a star on TV. For years, the debate on this film is if this really happened or if it's an extention of this screw-up's narsicistic fantasy. When he walks on stage, the announcer says ""wonderful, wonderful, wondeful.""

Both films deal with individuals, isolated from the mainstream of society, whose frustration ultimately causes them to lash out in order to get what they want.  And, both movies have similar ironic endings.

Robert DeNiro stars THE KING OF COMEDY, playing a nerdy comedian wannabe who, after numerous rejections from his staff, kidnaps talk show host Jerry Lewis and holds him hostage in order to get a shot on his television show.  Amorous Lewis fan Sandra Bernhard is his partner in the plot.

Perhaps the most interesting character in the piece is the one played by Lewis.  Though adored by his public and catered to by his staff, he is actually just as lonely and isolated as the DeNiro and Bernhard characters.

753664,5,6303982662,"Be forewarned, this is not a laugh out loud comedy that will have you rolling in the isles.  It is a more subtle yet utterly hysterical satire that pokes fun at the road to fame and the dim-witted hacks that clutter that said road.  It exposes the disease that it fame and how easy it is for one to deceive themselves into thinking they have what it takes; and then again how easy it is for someone who lacks talent to make it on pure ambition alone.

`The King of Comedy' revolves around Robert Pupkin, a delusional wannabe comedian who sees local late night talk show host Jerry Langford as his ticket to the big leagues.  Every night on the `Jerry Show' they have a `King of Comedy' and Pupkin desires to be that said king.  He tries to corner Jerry, prodding him with material and asking him to consider letting him on the show, but when Jerry tries to let him down easy he only retaliates with a more forceful approach.  After several failed attempts to become a part of Jerry's life Rupert finally decides that he has to take a more extreme approach to the matter, and that's when he enlists the help of another obsessive fan, Masha, in a kidnapping scheme that finally gets Rupert the attention he feels he deserves.

The script is deliciously subtle, a script that relies on the audiences perception of events rather than obvious gags.  Case-in-point, one never hears Rupert's actual standup until the very end of the film, so we are only to conclude that he is a no-talent hack with no potential on the reactions of others, making up our own minds much later on in the film.

It is the strong performances that really elevate the film though, Robert De Niro once again proving why he was considered the greatest actor of his generation.  As Rupert, De Niro never makes him a likable guy but always presents him in a way that endears us to him.  He is annoying and obnoxious and completely delusional but there is some small quality within him that is so honestly human we can't help but relate.  I mean which one of us hasn't had a fake conversation with a celebrity just to feel what it would be like to be `on their level'?

I found myself wondering if I am that delusional in my desire to be famous...

The rest of the cast is just as wonderful, from Jerry Lewis who actually plays it straight here, reigning in his own comedic energy to play the average celebrity trying his hardest to live a normal life.  Sandra Bernhard steals every scene as Masha, throwing her over-the-top antics in our face and causing that ripple effect in our guts until we're bursting with laughter.

If ever there was a film to squash the claim that Martin Scorsese only directs gangster flicks, this would be that film.  It is smart, witty and insanely honest and drives Scorsese (and even De Niro) in a direction they rarely venture.  It is one of Scorsese's finest films and one of De Niro's finest performances, and that's saying a lot since both director and actor are usually phenomenal.

The films ending is rather appropriate, and actually elevates the film for me for it speaks such honesty, especially in a world littered with fake celebrities (I'm looking at you Kim Kardashian).  In a reality based society where misfits litter the audition segments of top shows like `American Idol' it appears that `The King of Comedy' is more pertinent today than it was upon its release.  Maybe that's why the film garnered no traction at the time.  This is sad; for `The King of Comedy' is one of the smartest comedies I have had the pleasure of seeing and is one that is sure to get a rise out of anyone who is remotely up to date with today's pop culture.",1222128000,12,3647,4.502276176024279

The part DeNiro plays here is as different from Taxi Driver or Raging Bull as you can get, but he still shows why in the early 80's he was THE best actor to have in your movie. From what I have read DeNiro did a lot of preparation work (as always) for this movie, and it shows, he is never less than utterly convincing.

There are some marvellous (though cringe-making) scenes in this film. Particularly when Pupkin (DeNiro) is trying to get to see Langford (Lewis). The receptionist tells Pupkin he's not in, so Pupkin just waits and waits. The cringe factor is like that in Alan Partridge, or perhaps The Office, except that you won't be laughing through this.

I've not seen Jerry Lewis in any other films but thought both he and Sandra Bernhard gave fine performances. This film also shows that Scorcese is capable of making great films regardless of the subject matter.

753824,3,6303982662,"This is a pretty darn good movie, although there was this nagging sense throughout that I had seen it all before. De Niro playing a stalker who relentlessly hunts down a celebrity: ""The Fan."" The man who does not know the difference between being a star in your head and being a star in real life: ""Science of Sleep."" A man driven by his passion for fame and fortune who takes that passion and drives it towards its ugly final conclusion: ""Hustle and Flow."" But as my friend keeps reminding me it doesn't count if you get deja vu from the older film. So all of my comparisons are pretty much null and void, but I can't go back in time so oh well. And still this film about Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) who attacks his quest for fame with a pitbulls tenacity through the pits and valleys his life has in store for him is quite entertaining. Scorsese rarely makes a bad movie and this isn't one of them. We learn plenty about this Mr. Pupkin and very little of it is flattering. He is a pathetic man who has allowed the dark side of the American Dream to claim victory over his soul. In many ways celebrities provide mirrors into out psyches, we create them so that we can see ourselves in a perfect, beautiful light. Unfortunately Pupkin takes that a little too seriously, so seriously in fact he believes that he is the heir apparent to a late night talk show hosted by Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). Along with fellow schemer Masha (Sandra Bernhard) Pupkin hatches a plan to get his face on the tube. He follows the age old adage: When all else fails, kidnap. And so he does. Langford is forced to pay for the sins of apathy, and Pupkin goes on the become king for the night.

I would say that today, in the age of Paris Hilton (boo!), is the perfect time to re-examine this film. It touches on a very timely topic, that being the phenomenon of being famous simply for being famous. We know Paris Hilton for her bod, Jessica Simpson for her lack of brain cells, and William Hung for doing a bad job on a bad TV game show. So in that respect the fact that Pupkin became famous by forcing his way on the air, by any and all means necessary, seems amazingly prophetic. And De Niro disappears into the role, as much as is humanly possible for De Niro to disappear into any role. Here is a man who, after forcing his way upon Langford early on in the film, mistakes affability with his big break. He is delusional, he is a stalker, he is a social reject. But he is going to be a star. . .just ask him. Or ask him to show you his John Hancock in his autograph book, conveniently enough it is right next to Burt Reynolds' and Marilyn Monroe's. His grasp on reality is non-existent and if his hopes and dreams don't give it away then his outfits certainly do. Many of the scenes here are hard to watch. Pupkin sets up camp inside his office and won't leave until he is forced out the front door. He takes a date with him to Langford's for the weekend, uninvited of course, and once again is removed from the premises. And thanks to De Niro's performance we truly believe that this man cannot tell the difference between pursuing happiness and being a nuisance. Be sure to watch for a cute little cameo from Scorsese himself near the end. The film is strong but unassuming. This is not Scorsese stretching for greatness but a dialed down human drama that isn't that far removed from ""Taxi Driver."" Mr. Pupkin is better natured and more of a go getter, but deep down him and Travis Bickle have a lot in common. ***1/2",1174608000,,3509,4.332826747720365

De Niro was just outstanding, one of his best efforts in an illustrious career.

Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard also were really good here, in supporting roles. Comedians sometimes make great dramatic actors as Lewis has demonstrated in several films. I don't know, frankly, if Bernard has ever done anything remotely as good as this.

Biographies of eccentric people usually are interesting and this one more than fits the bill. This movie was not popular with audiences and a number of critics but I think it was superbly done with laugh-out-loud lines as well as subtle humor and great acting.

De Niro and Scorsese created many films together and it seems everything they lay their hands on turns to gold - whether it's a gangster flick or a comedy.

It pretends to be very serious but this seriousness is also hilarious. That's a real skill to make a no-nonsense movie everybody will be laughing madly about.

I am a big fan of Mr. Scorsese's, and finally got around to watching what I thought would be a very worthwhile movie just this week. Instead I was awestruck by how simple the premise is (the layers of meaning many reviews here laud are all supplied by the viewers themselves, since nothing in the movie actually hints of any deeper meaning). Robert DeNiro, one of the greatest American actors of any generation, will not have his skill as a comic actor referenced in his obituary, since he has none (Midnight Run, Meet the Fockers, the mob movie with Billy Crystal-he is not remotely funny in any of them). Rupert Pupkin is a completely uninteresting character, almost a Taxi Driver light kind of guy, without the gravitas.

This is supposedly a very dark comedy about fame. But the reality for me was that it just sat there on the screen going nowhere, doing nothing and saying nothing. I am actually astounded how uninteresting and how unenjoyable this movie is, and felt I had to counter the adoring hoards who have posted four and five star reviews. I rarely give anything a two star review, but this movie is undeserving of being considered average (three stars in my system). It is well below average. It is a total waste of your time, unless you are a film student who wants to see proof that geniuses can make bad movies too. You have been forewarned.",1127865600,11,1471,4.571969696969697
753945,5,6303982662,"Anyone who has been a professional actor, studied acting, or even taking a third rate high school acting class knows that comedy is much more difficult than drama. If you do not know anything at all about acting, consider that when watching Robert De Niro do his thing in this little seen 1983 gem.

De Niro stars at Rupert Pupkin. A would be stand-up comedian who lives in his mother's basement. Rupert is a big fan of a popular late night comedy show, that has a reputation of being a breading ground for up and coming comedians. He manages to slip into the car of the host of the show late one night and mentions to him that he is a comic. When he is repeatedly rejected by the shows producers, he decides that the only way for him to become famous is to kidnap the host and promise to return him only if he is given a chance to showcase his comedy chops live on the air.

The premise may be a bit contrived, but it has been copied many times in recent years. The heart and soul of the movie is De Niro's performance. He manages to bring a sweet kind of compassion to this lovable loser. Rupert is not a great comic, but he is not a horrible one either. The result of his late night appearance gives the film a very satisfying and hilarious conclusion.

In addition to De Niro, Sandra Bernhard and Jerry Lewis also do wonderful work here. That is right, I said Sandra Bernhard and Jerry Lewis. And they are not actors who just happen to share the same names as the people above. The greatest American director does it again.",1127174400,2,1527,4.295138888888889
753946,5,6303982662,"I almost didn't buy the Blu-ray, because of negative comments about a poor transfer. The transfer is supposedly from the camera negative, and often looks it, as in the first scene with Rupert and Rita. The blacks are deep, the colors rich, and the sharpness and detail exemplary. (I sometime wonder what equipment some viewers own.) You can buy the Blu-ray without fear.

""The King of Comedy"" is the complementary ""bookend"" of another Scorsese masterpiece, ""Taxi Driver"", with Robert DeNiro playing asocial, near-psychotic fame-obsessed characters in both. Both films play strongly against audience expectation -- ""King"" even more than ""Taxi"".

In ""The King of Comedy"", DeNiro's character, Rupert Pupkin -- a seemingly untalented standup-comic wannabe -- is played for very black non-laughs. Rupert is so cut off from normal social interaction that he's unable to make any progress towards becoming the ""king of comedy"" he knows he's destined to be. When an encounter with his late-night idol Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) finally opens the possibility of appearing on television, he completely blows the chance, throwing him into the anguish that provokes increasingly demented assaults on his idol.

On your first viewing -- and likely your third and tenth -- you'll be so violently embarrassed by Pupkin's self-destructive behavior that your toes will spastically curl down -- and stay there. You'll squirm so much you'll think you've mutated into a graboid. Rumor has it the actors //themselves// were so embarrassed that scenes which should have taken hours to film took //days//.

This acute discomfort explains the film's box-office failure (not to mention its ""sitting in the can"" for a year) -- the average viewer isn't interested in a protagonist devoid of any sympathetic or redeeming characteristics -- until the end.

The ending wholly upsets our expectations. Though we've been lead to believe Rupert lacks any mirth-provoking skills, he shows himself quite able to get an audience to laugh. His routine might not be brilliant, but he's no less funny than most comedians guesting on late-night talk shows.

Significantly, Pupkin's routine isn't a series of jokes, but a more or less literal recitation of his miserable childhood. What the audience finds funny is actually Rupert's personal tragedy. We finally understand why he's so screwed up. (I emphatically disagree with Roger Ebert that the film has no ""payoff"" and the ending is ""cynical and unsatisfying"". But then, Ebert had trouble with unconventional comedies.)

Though ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" are fundamentally similar, the latter inverts two important elements of the former...

>> Despite its gritty look, ""Taxi Driver"" is fundamentally romantic, while ""King of Comedy"" treats the material in a semi-documentary style. Scorsese never ""tells"" us how we're supposed to react to the characters.

>> We're initially annoyed (to say the least!) by Rupert Pupkin, then ultimately sympathize with him. Travis Bickle is at first the sympathetic loner, until we realize he's a psycho -- underscored (pun intended) by Bernard Herrmann's re-use of the three-note ""mad house"" theme at the end.

Which brings us to the films' use of music. The ""Taxi Driver"" score came from the greatest film composer yet to have set pen to paper, while ""King of Comedy"" has //no// score. Why?

Bernard Herrmann felt music was needed to make an emotional connection between the screen and the audience. This ain't necessarily so -- you can fully convey the most-profound emotions in a scoreless film (eg, ""The Execution of Private Slovick"").

Music's ability to enhance emotion is //so// strong it can override the director's intentions. This is probably why Hitchcock initially told Herrmann //not// to score Janet Leigh's shower. Without music, the scene is indescribably brutal. With Herrmann's music, its Expressionistic elements are raised to the Nth power. Is it any wonder Hitchcock was thrilled and let the music stand?

Scorsese must have recognized this, and realized that any musical ""comment"" on Rupert Pupkin's behavior would only soften and sentimentalize the audience's reaction to him. When Pupkin makes an utter fool of himself, the audience has to experience it directly -- gurgling bassoons can't be telling the viewer they're not supposed to take it seriously. Similarly, when we finally begin to understand Rupert at the end, Scorsese doesn't want to sentimentalize the moment.

If you have any lingering doubts about seeing ""The King of Comedy"", there's //one thing// in it (ignoring even DeNiro's incredibly perfect ""should have won an Oscar"" performance -- he //is// Rupert Pupkin) that fully justifies a viewing: After kidnapping Langford, Pupkin and Masha tie him to a chair, then duct-tape his mouth.

The sight of ""Mr. Greasy-Hair No-Talent"" himself, Jerry Lewis, with his mouth taped shut (Oh, joy! Oh, rapture!), is worth the price of admission, many, many times over. If all of Martin Scorsese's work were destroyed, except for this one scene, it would be enough to sanctify his art as a movie maker. I grovel at Scorsese's feet, for (at least symbolically) putting the French toast of intellectuals in his place. It's doubly pleasing, because Lewis's turn as Langford is, consciously or not, strikingly self-satirizing. He was the //only// actor for the role.

If you have Microsoft Cinemania, look up the Ebert and Kael reviews. Ebert's shows why he is one of the finest critics around -- whether or not you agree with him, you come away with a better understanding of a film. (It's also worthwhile reading Ebert's review of ""Taxi Driver"" to see how much of what he says about that film can be applied to ""The King of Comedy."") Kael's review shows that the only insight she has into anything is her own self-serving attitude. There was never a ""serious"" movie critic who brought //less// -- intellectually or emotionally -- to the reviewing process than Pauline Kael (qv, her review of ""2001"").

Is ""The King of Comedy"" a truly great film? I don't know. But it //is// a terrific piece of totally uncompromising film making. Anyone who claims to love movies should see it.",1125878400,10,6165,5.179899497487437
753947,5,6303982662,"Robert Deniro fans certainly know this movie. Many others don't. I would say this is one of his best roles, as good as the character of Dwight that he plays in another unfamiliar classic, This Boys' Life. Deniro is cast as Rupert Pupkin, a pathetic celebrity wanna=be who finally unleashes a sinister plan to get his stand up comedy act on television after all legal attempts fail. Sandra Bernhardt is excellent as Pupkins' partner in crime and Jerry Lewis is at his best as Jerry Langford, a Johnny Carson style late night talk show host who has become weary of the trappings of the celebrity life he is forced to live. The viewer is reminded of past DeNiro characters such as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and even Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull because the explosive nature of the character threatens to be revealed at any moment. Pupkins'continuous hounding of Langford is funny and disturbing at the same time. Look for a cameo appearance by director Martin Scorcese.

753948,5,6303982662,"Though comparing Rupert Pupkin with Jake La Motta and Travis Bickle is not entirely inappropriate, The King of Comedy was a decisive change of pace for both De Niro and Scorsese. At this point De Niro was already a major star, having made his bones not only in Scorsese masterpieces like 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver' but also in Cimino's classic 'The Deer Hunter' and of course as the young Vito Corleone in 'The Godfather Part 2'. He already had at this point two Oscars under his belt, one for Best Supporting Actor ('The Godfather Part 2') and one for Best Leading Actor ('Raging Bull'), plus two more nominations. And it was at this point that Scorsese cast him in a bizarre and off-beat dark comedy alongside slapstick legend Jerry Lewis.

The King of Comedy was, not entirely surprisingly, a flop, the biggest commercial fiasco Scorsese had since he first reached major recognition with 'Mean Streets'. Reviewing it today, it seems like 'The King of Comedy' was years ahead of its time, and underneath a couple of cheap laughs it has disturbing dark undertones that make it one of the most fascinating creations in Scorsese's career. Jerry Lewis plays not the goofy kind of character he's famous for, but is actually quite impressive playing straight man for Robert De Niro, who is nothing short of brilliant (as he always was when working with Scorsese). De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring but obnoxious stand-up comedian who is certain that talk-show superstar Jerry Langford (Lewis) is the one who will help him get to the top. When he realizes that no help is coming his way, Pupkin resorts to desperate measures and kidnaps Langford in order to force him to give him a spot on his show.

The premise doesn't sound like much, but it's the construction of Pupkin's character that makes it a truly fascinating watch. Pupkin is ambitious, enthusiastic and eager to please; yet behind his cheerful smile and perfect manners a twisted brain works, as he creates for himself a fantasy world in which he and Langford are best buddies. In a way, Rupert is similar to Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver - like him, he's an almost nave idealist who resorts to violence to achieve his goals in face of the harsh world surrounding him. But Rupert, who seems at first like a harmless eccentric, becomes creepier and more disturbing - and at the same time, almost identifiable - as the film goes by, up to the controversial and disturbing finale. A nice addition is the character of Masha (stand-up comic Sandra Bernhard), Pupkin's eerie sidekick (though exactly how she knows him is unclear), who also has an imaginary relationship with Langford and helps Pupkin with his plans in order to get her own. Masha is in there mainly for laughs, but she also does well in shedding a different light on Pupkin's character, and the interplay between the two is wonderful; Pupkin thinks that Masha is imagining things and treats her with disregard - while Masha, of course, holds pretty much the same opinion about Pupkin. Bernhard finally grants one of the film's most poignant moments when she passionately sings Ray Charles's 'Come Rain Or Come Shine' to a tied and gagged Langford.

The King of Comedy is a disturbing film to watch and is not to be taken at face value. It's well recommended, though, a masterpiece by Scorsese that somehow got lost in his huge pile of classics. It's maybe not as universal as Taxi Driver, but it's just as timeless and just as sensitive and inventive. Essential for fans of Scorsese and of De Niro.",1121212800,,3530,4.764705882352941

754044,5,6303982662,"Martin Scorsese is one of the best film directors today. Robert Deniro has teamed up with Scorsese in over 5 movies: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, and more. Scorsese's films are primarily realistic, meaning that the stories that he works on are reflections of some real social issues. Take Taxi Driver, where Travis Bickle played by Robert Deniro, an average american nobody, takes up guns and an assassination plot to kill a local political figure to attract some sort of attention to his miserable and useless self, only to later channel all his anger in making a positive action by ridding the community from a disgusting lowlife pimp and his croonies.

In The King Of Comedy, Scorsese offers us another slice of american realism. This time Travis Bickle...er, I mean Rupert Pupkin played again by Deniro, is our central character. Pupkin is another average american nobody who is so self-centered, too obnoxious, and worst of all, he thinks too much of himself. He wants to become the new king of comedy, a phenomenal comedian who will take america by storm. Pupkin begins harrassing Jerry Langford, a famous TV talk show host, played by Jerry Lewis, who is more like Johnny Carson or in today's terms, David Letterman. All that Rupert wants is a chance to be in a short stand up on Jerry's show, and all that Jerry wants is Rupert off his back. Unlike Taxi Driver's Bickle, Pupkin doesn't resort to violence, instead he kidnaps Jerry and demands to be on the live show. The results are hilarious.

The King of Comedy is a realistic but very quirky film with Robert Deniro delivering one of his most outstanding and underrated performances in his career.

The movie also stars Sandra Bernhard as Rupert's equally twisted and Jerry-crazed sister.

754045,5,6303982662,"This film has something of a checkered history.  It was originally filmed in 1981, but in the wake of the assassination of John Lennon and the attempts on Ronald Reagan and the Pope the release of the film was delayed until the spring of 1983.  Despite generally rave reviews from the critics, the film died a quick death at the box office.  This film is not so much a comedy but a commentary on our obsession with celebrity.  Robert DeNiro plays Rupert Pupkin, a no-talent wannabe who wants to obtain fame without having to work for it.  The vehicle, in his mind, to fame is through Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), host of the nation's top talk show.  Rupert badgers Langford at his office and even has the audacity to show up unannounced at his home.  Unable to accept no for an answer, Rupert along with his equally obsessed cohort, Masha, (Sandra Bernhard)take the radical step of kidnapping Langford.  My theory as to why this film failed at the box office is it contained too many truths about ourselves and our celebrity-obsessed culture.  DeNiro plays a sociopath that in some degree is just as bad as Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"".  It goes without saying that DeNiro is at the top his game in the role.  Not to be dismissed is Jerry Lewis' performance here as a man who carries the weight of celebrity very heavily.  There are two scenes, I thought, where Lewis was partcularly good.  One, a scene where he is alone in his apartment in the city after fending off fans.  He doesn't say a word but the look on his face says alot.  Secondly, the scene in which he confronts Rupert at his home in the country.  The rage is so palpable that you get the feeling that Lewis may have faced this situation in real life many times before.  On a note of trivia one of the production assistants to Jerry's show is played by one-time Charlie's Angel Shelley Hack.  And look closely for members of the rock group, the Clash, in an unspoken cameo.  Also, Robbie Robertson has assembled a good musical soundtrack for this film.

What is most telling in this film are the final mintues that document his fame after he goes to jail for kidnapping a talk show host. Few films have so accurately, and cynically, portrayed the world wide news media thirst for fame as these 10 minutes.

754050,5,6303982662,"""Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime.""
As Travis Bickle's universally known line of dialogue from ""Taxi Driver"" has a deep meaning (""Are you talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here""), Rupert Pupkin's closing speech of his first-ever standup comedy routine in ""The King of Comedy"" finalizes the entire meaning of the film, wrapping it up in one short sentence. Is it better to have one great day versus nothing? Do the ends justify the means? Two questions all of us ask ourselves at one point of time in our life.
The comparisons to Travis Bickle seem stronger on paper than they do in the film. The most striking resemblance between the two stories is that both contain the central theme of a man snapping and doing something apparently crazy. Both films star Robert De Niro, and both are directed by Martin Scorsese, which makes for an interesting discussion of relation. Some may even say that it's a sequel in sorts.
Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) is a lonely man whose daily life and routines consist around one man: Jerry Langston, a talk show host and comedian who is followed by a horde of rabid fans, including Masha (Sandra Bernhard), a fan to rival Pupkin, who admits that he has waited nine hours at a time outside Jerry's recording studio to catch a glimpse of him as he is shoved into limos by fancy bodyguards.
Rupert is given a rare opportunity to speak to Jerry one day as he saves him from Masha, who assaulted Jerry with kisses and hugs. It is as they drive away together and Rupert talks to Jerry that he proposes his long-time dream, which is to appear on Jerry's show as an aspiring standup comic. Of course, he's had no experience. But Rupert swears he would be great on stage -- he's studied Jerry for years and knows timing.
Langston gets these psychos all the time, but he doesn't realize just how strong a fan Rupert is until he shows up at his private home with suitcases and a girl claiming to have been invited. ""I made a mistake,"" Rupert says. ""So did Hitler,"" Jerry barks.
Jerry Lewis plays Jerry Langston in a self-referential (and very unflattering) role. It's his finest to date. The guy is a scumbag who barely tolerates fans and is cruel. Lewis has lost his manic, energetic, annoying comedy rituals seen in films such as ""The Nutty Professor"" and has moved on to real acting that demands true skill. Gone are the squeaky voice and the crossed eyes. Here is perhaps the wretched soul who really exists behind Jerry Lewis, as we know him.
All of us exaggerate, but Rupert does so to an extreme. After being shoved out of Jerry's limo the night of their confrontation with an invitation to call Jerry's secretary to schedule a meeting, Rupert shows up at Jerry's office claiming to have an appointment. ""Is Jerry expecting you?"" he is asked by a clerk. ""Yes, I don't think so,"" Rupert says.
Jerry and his workers, who deny his taped comedy routine that we never hear until the end, shun Rupert. ""Oh, I see, this is what happens to people like you from all of this!"" Rupert yells at Jerry. ""No,"" he replies. ""I've always been like this.""
So Rupert breaks down and kidnaps Jerry with the help of Masha, demanding a spot on his TV show as a ransom payment. He commands that he will be referenced to as ""The King of Comedy"" (hence the title), and to further demonstrate the innocence of Rupert's character, when he shows up, he fails to see the gravity of the offence he has just committed.
Rupert is twisted, as you may have guessed by now, but not in a Travis Bickle kind of way. He doesn't see the bad in the world -- he's oblivious to it. ""You're so naive!"" Masha tells him. I wouldn't be surprised if he took it as a compliment.
Rupert lives in complete isolation, kept locked up with his mother and living his life by what he says on TV. His dialogue and mannerisms are all clichd -- he says the kind of stuff one would expect a poorly written film to feature. When he tries to impress a female bartender, and when he tries to make small talk with Jerry, he frightens both individuals (similar to Travis Bickle frightening Senator Palantine and the Secret Service Agent).
Rupert daydreams a lot, pretending to be a guest on Jerry's show and fighting off requests to host the show for six weeks. It's when the film cuts back and forth between a fancy restaurant and Rupert's mother's basement, with her yelling at him to shut up, that we realize how strange -- and yet how similar to all of us -- he really is.
The film essentially flopped upon its release in 1983, bringing in only $2,500,000 on a $20,000,000 budget. It has yet to find a strong cult following such as films like ""Austin Powers"" that brought in little in theaters and lots on video. But any fan of Scorsese and De Niro's work will adore ""The King of Comedy."" And it's the only De Niro/Scorsese flick that can be recommended to families.
As Rupert takes the stage at the end of the film, his entire dreams have been laid forth in front of him and he takes them by the throat. It is in that truly startling moment we've all been waiting for when we learn that Rupert is not only funny, but pretty darn talented. If the movie had used Rupert's life-long dreams as the butt end of a joke, if he had turned out to be an absolutely horrid comedian (which is what I honestly thought would happen), the film would have little effect. But as a filmgoer and critic, it ranks as one of the most surprising scenes I have ever laid eyes on.",1072742400,4,5450,4.451
754051,5,6303982662,"De Niro is great, and Lewis gives his best performance. Bernhardt is delightfully eccentric. Watch it twice--once you know how it turns out, the whole movie has a different feeling.",1060300800,,181,5.066666666666666
754052,4,6303982662,"Ever since I saw Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER I've had a problem getting into cabs especially in New York City. I always find myself asking, ""Could Travis Bickle be driving me around?"" What a scary thought. That fear has lingered into my adult hood. Now thanks to Mr. Scorsese I'm afraid of stand-up comics. Stop scaring me.
The King of Comedy tells the story of Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro, Flawless). Pupkin is a man with a dream, to become the newest King of Comedy. He will stop at nothing to get on the hottest late night talk show ""The Jerry Langford Show"" and after many months of trying he finally forces a meeting between him and the host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis, Funny Bones).
After the meeting Rupert thinks he's made a new friend. Too bad Jerry doesn't realize that. So Rupert begins to stalk Jerry, showing up at his office, and out his summer home. Then Rupert gets fed up with Jerry's games and decides to kidnap him. Will this get him a shot on the Jerry Langford show? That's up to you to find out.
THE KING OF COMEDY is Taxi Driver light. Rupert Pupkin is disturbed but not dangerous. This works really well, because it gives you an under dog to root for, even if the ends don't justify the means. But aren't all of us a little star struck. Don't we all at one time or another look up and see some hack on television, or a Michael Bay movie and say ""Hey I Can Do That?"" I think well all have a little Rupert Pupkin in us.
De Niro makes Pupkin come alive. Rupert Pupkin is a really annoying guy. He's the kind of guy who attacks famous people with banal chitchat. If I were famous I'd want to steer clear of a guy like this. I would assume De Niro has had exposure to people like this and that's why he can channel a character like this. It's a strong performance with subtle wit and amazing presence.
I especially liked the scene outside Jerry Apartment Building where Rupert doesn't want to stop talking to Jerry and Jerry just wants to get away from this nut. I loved the urgency in Rupert's voice like if he were to stop talking this night would end and that can't happen. It's almost a letdown when Jerry walks into his apartment. The mind game over. It's a shame.
Another bright spot in this film is an actress I usually have very little faith in Sandra Bernhard (Hudson Hawk). She plays Masha, another one of Jerry Langford's obsessive fans, and Rupert's partner in crime. There is a sequence in which she tries to seduce Jerry; it's a performance that is both painful and silly, and really astonishing. I was impressed.
THE KING OF COMEDY is a lot of fun. It's also quite painful, and beautiful at the same time. Director Scorsese does a bang up job, even going as far as inviting the likes of Dr. Joyce Brothers and Tony Randall in as guest stars. Offering us that little spark of reality. What a great movie THE KING OF COMEDY is.
Why not give it a try yourself.

754053,5,6303982662,"Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have their most under rated teaming here. The film had some scenes that I felt were perhaps more disturbing than those in the infamous Taxi Driver, just in the how originally twisted the lead's methods become.
De Niro is struggling nobody/comic Rupert Pupkin (if you define struggling as a man who talks to cardboard pictures of Liza Minelli and other celebtiries in his basement, working on his dialogue on a show he plans to get on), who stalks a comic and celebrity personality Jerry Longford (Jerry Lewis gives his most straightforward work here) to get a spot on his show. When Pupkin fails at his attempts, he goes for the desperate approach and kidnaps him. Startling most of the way, but it is the climax which will arouse audiences to be stunned from the irony in the tie in- ""better to be king for a day than a shmuck for a lifetime"".
One of the best Scorsese works (but of course, there are so many great ones, it's not fair to compare); he appears briefly as a director from the talk show.  A few members of the punk group the Clash appear as street gawkers.

754195,4,6303982662,"""The King Of Comedy"" is another collaboration between the great director Martin Scorsese and the fantastic actor Robert De Niro. This time, the two geniuses created a black comedy with doses of critic to the devotion to celebrities of every major city in the world.

 ""The King Of Comedy"" is a smart satire about the showbusiness world and the diehard fans that take things to the extreme. This film success because the performances are strong: Robert De Niro is as great as usual, but in this movie there are two surprises. The first one was Jerry Lewis. Instead of his usual slapstick humor and funny faces, Lewis did a low-key performance, one of his finest works. The second surprise was Sandra Bernhard, she was an unknown actress before ""The King Of Comedy"".

 On the other hand, the DVD edition of ""The King Of Comedy"" is not very satisfying. The audio and video quality is average at best. The DVD features are few, but some are good. There is a documentary about the making of the movie, some deletes scenes and a TV Spot. But the movie is good enough to buy the DVD.

 ""The King Of Comedy"" is a black comedy, very different to a standard comedy. This movie invites the audience to the think, instead of plain humor. If you prefer a cheap entertainment and stupid jokes, go see an Adam Sandler movie or ""American Pie"" 2 & 3. If you are looking for an intelligent and incisive comedy, ""The King Of Comedy"" is your movie.",1059264000,,1428,4.536964980544747
754196,5,6303982662,"Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' has long been a favourite film of mine. The storyline is nothing grand, and the acting is passing fair, but it is the little psychological pieces that keep poking in that make this movie an interesting one to watch.
This is not a typical Jerry Lewis film by any means. He is not a comedian in this film (of course, I know many who think, 'he's not a comedian in any film'). He plays the straight man, a rather sour and jaded entertainment professional. Robert DeNiro (as Rupert Pupkin) and Sandra Bernhard (as Marsha) play two star-struck fans who have focussed their lives on Jerry Langford (Lewis' character) to the extent that they are imagining weekend outings with him and knitting sweaters for him. The story largely revolves around Rupert's desire to be a comic and appear on Langford's Tonight Show-style talkshow.
In an interesting twist, given the Tonight Show character of the show, the movie features cameos from many old talkshow stand-bys, including Victor Borge, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and Tony Randall.
As Rupert and Marsha compete with each other to outdo the other in establishing a 'relationship' with Langford (everything from owning memorabilia to autographs to event attendance) Rupert's imagination keeps concocting more elaborate relationships, which he finally fails to be able to distinguish from reality. This comes to a confrontation when he travels out to Langford's weekend home (with an unsuspecting woman in tow) and gets ejected from the home by Langford and told, in no uncertain terms, that he is neither known nor wanted.
At this point, being confronted with a painful reality, Rupert decides upon drastic action, and with the assistance of Marsha, kidnaps Langford and holds him for ransom, the ransom being an appearance on the show.
Rupert's fantasies include being married to his high school crush on the show, by his old principal, who apologises for not seeing the worth in Rupert; Langford pleading with a resistant Rupert to guest host the show; essentially, everything in Rupert's life that had gone wrong gets righted.
This is dark humour, to be sure, and the pace can be rather slow. But this movie is largely overlooked, and deserves a bit more attention for the interesting psychological devices in the story.",1053907200,,2294,5.0394736842105265

754198,4,6303982662,"This is one of the great ""lost"" Martin Scorsese films; it has not and will not gain the attention that his more violent (but just as brilliant) epics have drawn, which really says more about audiences and critics than Scorsese.  People complain about Scorsese's penchant for bloodshed, but they ignore the fact that very few of his films deal directly with organized crime, and they also deprive themselves of appreciating his versatility, on display in gems like ""King of Comedy.""  The film came out in 1983, a troubled and expensive production that disappointed many who were looking for a follow-up to 1980's ""Raging Bull.""  ""King"" is uneven in its pacing and script, especially after the kidnapping takes place.  Rupert Pupkin is not one of the great Scorsese protagonists and DeNiro struggles with the role a bit.  The compelling performance belongs to Jerry Lewis, who is a revelation here: subtle, barely controlled, and finally sympathetic--how could he manage that, you ask?  Well, DeNiro and Scorsese had something to do with it, but watch the scene in which Jerry explains the pressures of his life to Rupert after being kidnapped and then tell me that Lewis didn't reach down into his own soul for that one.  The fantasy scenes with Rupert, Jerry, and Diahnne Abbott (once married to DeNiro, and sultry gorgeous--a beautiful movie actress who doesn't buy into starvation images) are disturbing yet funny.  Sandra Bernhard: after Lewis, the best acting here, charismatic, vulnerable, volatile and finally beautiful, too.  Scorsese keeps his thrilling camera and editing moves in check here and proves himself to be a great director of actors.  The film was widely perceived as a bitter commentary on how fame and infamy had changed Scorsese's life--some blamed him for creating situations that led to the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, when John Hinckley, obsessed by Jodie Foster in Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver,"" followed his obsession to an ugly end.
Now, after the passage of 20 years, we can return to the film without that baggage and enjoy it for showing us yet another side of the artistry of Scorsese.",1050883200,2,2125,5.063037249283668
754199,4,6303982662,"You know the old Warhol quote that ""everyone in the world, will eventually get their 15 minutes of fame""? In this 1983 film ""The King of Comedy"", director, Martin Scorsese explores this ideal further by looking at our culture's obsession with celebrity. He does this through the character of Rupert Pubkin (passionately played by Robert De Niro).Rupert is a would be comedian, who has a dream bordering on psychosis of becoming famous on a Johnny Carson styled TV talk show, which features his idol, Jerry Langford (brilliantly played by show biz legend, Jerry Lewis). Rupert is convinced in his own mind, that the TV host is his best buddy and that he is just one ""Jerry Langford Show"" appearance away from becoming a superstar. He makes several creepy, yet comical visits to Langford's offices, where he is rejected and humiliated in his quest to get on the show. Frustrated, he and another obsessive stalker (played with wild sexual abandon by a young, Sandra Bernhard) put into motion an amateur kidnapping scheme, that will get Rupert on the show and the attention he craves. Martin Scorsese has created a brilliant and unusual film which is funny, yet leaves you uneasy. It asks us to look at some rather uncomfortable questions about our culture through it's bizarre and scary characters. Why do we worship fame and celebrity? What is the line between just being a fan and being a stalker? Will we one day all be famous? Over twenty years ago, this film flopped at the box office. Why, I'm not sure. Maby it was just ahead of it's time. But today, in this modern age of reality TV, the ""King of Comedy"" seems like it is more relevent and prophetic than ever. The DVD for the film is well put together. It features some interesting menus.

This one is no exception and I can't believe it has taken me this long to finally see this amazing comedy.  Finally out on DVD, ""The King of Comedy"" is a terrific film on all fronts.
Directed by Martin Scorsese, ""The King of Comedy"" is about a man named Rupert Pupkin (De Niro); a man with dreams of stand-up comedy success and superstardom on his mind.  He doesn't spend too much time in the real world; his made-up world is far more enjoyable to him.  There is hardly a moment in where he isn't daydreaming some.  Rupert knows that the one man who can make his dreams come true is talk-show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis).  Unfortunately, Langford wants absolutely nothing to do with Pupkin and sees him only as another star-crazed and psychotic fan.  So, Rupert decides to do the next best thing that will guarantee him a spot on Jerry's show; he kidnaps him.  Everything else just goes straight to hell after that with unpredictable twists and turns.
This was a very funny and well-done movie that should've gotten more recognition when it was first out.  Although it may have never gotten the attention it deserved while in theatres, I feel it is more popular now than ever before.  I've always heard people quote the movie but never knew of which movie they were talking about.  Robert De Niro is amazing as ever and really has fun with his role.  Jerry Lewis is also incredible as the bitter talk show host who just wants to be left alone by everybody.  Sandra Bernhard also deserves mention because I thought she was hilarious in this as well.
I still can't believe this is a Martin Scorsese film.  I know all the familiar camera angels and techniques are there, but this is so different from anything else he has ever done.  He proves that his movies don't have to be violent and have to be full of profanities to be enjoyable.  He captures the absurdity and outrageousness perfectly.  Scorsese isn't just a terrific film maker, he is a unique storyteller as well.
The DVD is quite good as well.  Not the best, but has some very neat features to it.  I thought the transfer was really good, being that it is such an old movie.  I thought the picture looked great, although it did have its moments where it could've looked better.  However, the overall presentation was very impressive.  There are a few special features such as a making-of-featurette, still gallery, and a theatrical trailer and TV spot.  I wished there would've been more extras, but I was still satisfied for the most part.
""The King of Comedy"" is a wildly entertaining film that had me laughing from start to finish.  With a creative story and terrific acting, this is an amazing film that should be seen by all.  A true Scorsese classic gem that I will never get tired of.",1042934400,52,2861,4.56078431372549

The performances are fantastic and in Rupert Pupkin, the movie's weird protagonist (if there is one), DeNiro created one of the most complex characters of his career - - Pupkin is darkly hillarious and incredibly disturbing at the same time.
The pathetic scenes in which DeNiro's Pupkin pretends to be a guest on the popular Tonight Show-style talk show hosted by Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis as the Carson-style host) with cardboard cutouts of Liza Minelli, etc. and the imagined conversations/interviews are one of the highlights of the movie and DeNiro's performance.  Sandra Bernhardt is fantastic as the obsessed fan and enabler of all of Puplin's celebrity fantasies.
At its core, the movie is about the dangers of celebrity and the desire of everyday Joes and Janes to inject themselves into that world.  Pupkin is the natural and extreme extension of the personality quirks of anybody who has ever asked a celebrity for an autograph.
In the end, there's something oddly likeable in the pathetic Pupkin that DeNiro creates.  The arch of the movie follows his wild ride from untalented schmuck to ""c"" grade celebrity in his own right after he kidnaps talk show host Jerry Langford in his last desperate act to get five minutes of airtime on Langford's show.

I never even have these kinds of doubts when showing up for a Scorsese film anymore because I realized if he could pull this off, he could do anything.

Yes, DeNiro as a would-be comic who pesters and stalks tv star Jerry Lester (Lewis) to get his shot of stand-up fame and then performs stand-up brilliantly is a revelation.  Plus, you get to see another Jerry Lewis, probably the one who is much closer to the ""real"" Lewis. You haven't seen him since he played the ""Hyde"" part of Buddy Love in Lewis's ""Nutty Professor."" Lewis plays a very dark, cold, unfunny, calculating tv performer.  The best part with Lewis though are his scenes when he is being held hostage by Sandra Bernhard, who has the hots for him, to give Deniro's ""Rupert Pupkin"" his tv shot.  This may be the unlikeliest and thus funniest romantic pairing ever shown in a movie (entirely one sided as it is since Lewis/Lester is a total narcissist).

Have stopped reasoning as to why this movie not only flopped but did not attrack any kind of awards. Was it ahead of it's time? Is the name deceiving? It was after this movie I thought of De Niro as the most versatile actor I have ever known. If you are a Jerry Lewis fan, you ought to see this. If you are not, like me - I have turned to respect him as a brilliant actor here! Don't see this movie for your usual slapstick comedy or for the sake of finding a good laugh. Scorsese who's movies in general I am not a fan of, has not only shown great directing depth here but has stuck to reality. Why do I feel 'The King of Comedy' has a common ground with 'Shawshank Redemption & Ed Wood.'

Unfortunately, the story didn't call for much of special effects, causing, I believe, it to  miss at the box office.  This is a movie worth seeing. The story is good, good, good--top of the writing line. The acting by Di Niro, Sandra Bernhard, and Jerry Lewis ranks up there in the superb range. The minor characters--including Tony Randall--contribute believability to this zwacky plot. I never cared for Jerry Lewis until he played a straight drama role in Funny Bones.  Here in KING, though cast as a comedian, as in Funny Bones, his role is designed to perpetuate the image of a tycoon tyrant.  AND HE PLAYS IT PERFECTLY WELL. Sandra Bernhard is DYNAMITE. Why have un-needed special effects when an actress like Berhard, with her invigorating style,is able to spread a little ACTION around the scenes. She is serendipithy, a nugget, a gem.

754482,3,6303982662,"I found this film  intriguing on several levels. Its depiction of the brutal realities of desperately trying to break into show business contrast with the unrelenting pressures on those few who have reached the top. Robert De Niro's performance as the aspiring comic framed perfectly the elements of charm, guile, delusion and dogged perserverance. Egged on by a similiarly deluded Marsha (Sandra Bernhard), his Rupert Pupkin is at once both pitiable and menacing. The object of his unwelcomed attention is the late night king of television, Jerry Langford, very believably portrayed by Jerry Lewis. In my opinion, Mr. Lewis' dramatic acting is the best he has ever done, not once slipping into easy slapstick.  Perhaps some credit for this should go to Martin Scorsese's instincts as one of our finest directors. A host of cameos (including Scorsese) by famous personalities lend a certain believability to a community that is show business, a world that Pupkin desperately wants to be  part of. This sometimes disturbing film was not a box office success but nonetheless is an interesting study of the glue that holds the glitz together.",1014940800,6,1139,5.145945945945946

I remember seeing DeNiro doing his stand-up routine on Carson, thinking, ""This guy's funny!"" but had no idea he really wasn't a comedian.  I watch this movie just because it is so quirky and hilarious.  And nobody knows about it.  I think that for this movie, Jerry Lewis did very little acting.  He's too over-the-top on stage and on camera, so the character he plays in this movie is more true-to-life for him.  So I really don't like him either, and with Bernhard being so irritating and annoying, it's only the brilliance of DeNiro that keeps me watching.  Another example of why he is considered a master, among his many other hits like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and The Godfather.  But I mostly like it because it is almost uncomfortably neurotic, like I could be that guy, or that I know that guy, poor ....

754593,5,6303982662,"this film is (rather unfairly) underrated.  i don't know why.  a lot of people will say it's a ""taxi driver"" retread, some will say that it's way too bleak, some will say it's far too laden about with industry potshots that only industry workers will get.  the truth is, however, this is a very funny movie.
first off, the humor here is either very dark or very unsettiling.  here is rupert pupkin, an obsessive comic stalking his idol, jerry langford.  rupert speaks to a cardboard cutout of jerry, goes to his office each and every day (except for the days where he gets kicked out), and even fantasises about him.  often his fantasies are interlaced with the film's reality and we see just how obsessive he is.  not only this, but his life outside of stalking jerry is similarly inept.  he is also obsessed with a bartender.  she loathes him, but still he persists.  luckily, she is forgiving, and the two set out for a weekend at jerry's home.  they are quickly kicked out, leaving both jerry and his almost-girlfriend detesting him.  feeling rejected, he finds solace in a psychopathic, similarly obsessed woman who waits outside of jerry's office building for him to walk by.
at this point, the film seems kind of depressing, but along the way there are droplets of black comedy and extremely strange comedy.  it is not a movie for all tastes.  some will find it far too dark, others will find it predictable, and others may not even understand the film period.  the truth is, the film is able to find humor in this darkness, and very funny humor it is.  witness the routine at the end that we have been awaiting rupert to put on.  witness rupert's obsessive, 'round the clock telephoning of jerry's office.  it's mean spirited, yes, but still just plain hilarious.
at the same time, though, the film is a very interesting character study.  the film's primary subject is rupert.  we learn his techniques, his relationships, and we ponder his obsessive nature.  deniro is also riveting in his performance as pupkin, dropping the tough-guy image for the untalented loner image.  he's hopeful and confident, hilariousy bad at what he does, and refuses to take ""no"" for an answer.

Pupkin is a doggedly determined hack of a comedian, mired so deep in self-delusion as to border on a form of psychosis.  Thanks to DeNiro's talent (perfect as always), Pupkin is alternately loveable and detestably annoying.  You just want to reach into the screen and SMACK him sometimes (hence the word ""squirm"" above).  There are no missteps in this film - wonderfully cast!

754595,4,6303982662,"Just how far will a person go in the single-minded, obsessive pursuit of fame, and are there limits or boundaries involved that are inviolable?  Exactly where does one draw the line, and upon what must fame be based to be given validation?  Is it a matter of extraordinary talent, or is sensationalism alone part of the criteria?  Director Martin Scorsese addresses the matter and makes some observations and speculations about the cause and effect of fame in ""The King of Comedy,"" starring Robert De Niro as aspiring stand-up comedian Rupert Pupkin.  Obsessed with fame and the famous, Rupert's greatest treasure is a book of autographs he has collected, one page of which bears his own signature, possibly in anticipation of a future as reflected in his own mind's eye.  His immediate goal is to be a guest on the late night talk show hosted by Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), which he believes will catapult him to the pinnacle of notoriety.  The sad fact of the matter is that Rupert just isn't that clever, and he is decidedly not funny, despite hours spent in his room at home rehearsing his monologue.  His evenings are spent queuing up outside of Langford's theater with other fans and wannabes (many, sadly, like himself), waiting for Jerry to emerge.  Things suddenly take a turn for Rupert when one night, with an exceptionally aggressive crowd on hand, Jerry is mobbed while attempting to get to his car and Rupert comes to his rescue, getting Jerry safely into the car, along with himself.  And it's the beginning of a relationship that will prove to have a dramatic effect of the lives of both men.  Scorsese's film is something of a response to the criticism he received for his violent and somewhat controversial film, ""Taxi Driver,"" over the outcome of his antihero, Travis Bickle (played by De Niro).  This film is a character study, not only of the individuals involved, but of a society-- in this case a character in itself-- that allows fame for fame's sake, and perpetuates the problem through the irresolution of the masses.  On one hand, it's as if Scorsese is saying ""What are you thinking?"" while on the other, he's taking a step back, holding up a mirror and saying, ""Go ahead, take a good look at yourselves!""  For it is no mere accident that drives Rupert to the extreme measures he ultimately employs to effect his goal.  As always, De Niro gives a performance that is impeccable.  In De Niro's skin, Rupert Pupkin comes alive, and every bit of his single-minded, simplistic nature is believable.  He's the guy who can't quite get a handle on things, but hasn't the mental wherewithal to realize it.  Nevertheless, he is harmless until provoked, whether it be in reality or in his own mind; a man of simple tastes but grandiose dreams that have a way of intersecting with his own version of reality.  And De Niro conveys is all and more with an uncanny grasp of the character, the likes of which few actors could manage with such depth and perception.  Also turning in an exemplary performance is Jerry Lewis, who so succinctly captures the whole ""Steve Allen/Johnny Carson"" persona, as well as that sense of what late night television is all about.  And though he received little notice for it at the time (or since, for that matter), this is possibly the best work he's ever done.  The supporting cast includes the lovely Diahnne Abbott (Rita), Sandra Bernhard (Marsha), Ed Herlihy (Himself), Lou Brown (Band Leader), Catherine Scorsese (Rupert's Mom), Liza Minelli (Herself), Shelley Hack (Cathy) and Margo Winkler (Receptionist).  A somewhat caustic wake-up call, ""The King of Comedy,"" with it's blend of humor and profound observations of human nature, packs a wallop without shedding any blood, as it were.  It's an entertaining, challenging film that works on a number of emotional levels, and is something of a minor classic in it's own right.  And-- thanks to De Niro-- Rupert Pupkin is a guy you're not likely to forget anytime soon.  Another noteworthy milestone in the Scorsese/De Niro canon.",984960000,,4032,4.851094890510949
754596,5,6303982662,"I was delighted to discover this ironic and disturbing movie, directed with a sure hand by Scorsese and acted to the hilt by Robert De Niro.  Sometimes movies walk a fine line between repelling an audience and fascinating it.  This movie flopped at the box office precisely because of the irritating behavior of it's protagonist, yet the plot and performances are garnering increasing appreciation over the years. I was held in fascinated suspense, even though Rupert Pupkin has all the traits of an obsessed borderline personality, because the story develops with originality and an odd humor.
I found myself first repelled by Rupert because his ""profile"" could be that of a budding serial killer -- but on the other hand he is relatively benign and his increasingly outrageous attempts to impose himself upon talk show host Jerry Langford become funny, because he deserves to fail, and he does fail most of the time.  Pupkin gets rejected, snubbed, ignored, barely tolerated, and unceremoniously ejected by most everyone at the television network where Jerry works.  They've all got his number.  We've all known people who doggedly pursue others to the point at which their behavior gets them branded a ""nut.""  This is certainly Jerry Langford's opinion of Pupkin, particularly when Pupkin makes himself at home with his unsuspecting date at Jerry's place in a posh desert resort.  We come to respect the Langford character, and Jerry Lewis' fine performance, more and more every time Jerry tells Pupkin off.  Jerry Lewis is so good one begins to wonder how much is drawn from his own personality, but I think it's a testament to his rightness for the role.
Sandra Bernhard is also mesmerizing as Rupert's nearest sympathizer and Jerry-groupie in her own right.  The plot culminates with DeNiro and Bernhard kidnapping Lewis in a sequence that evoked the loudest amazed laughter from me.  Sandra is is fascinating, animated and wild-eyed, but without going over the top.  She, like the other principals, maintains a strong degree of realism in the performance.  Sandra winds up cluelessly attempting to seduce her hostage in sexy underwear while he's tied to a chair, in one of the movie's most entertaining scenes.
I think this movie works because it is such an unblinking look at people we don't often see in movies, the mildly delusional people who walk the streets and annoy and embarrass us, but never seem to get arrested until they do something really outrageous.  DeNiro and Bernhard are loony-toons and the plot lets them be thwarted and rebuffed and scorned, which is funny while being comforting to us.  We become alternately angry and embarrassed for the two groupies as we watch their clueless harrassment of people who intensely dislike them. Yet on another level, if we've ever been rejected by a pompous employer, we might sympathize a little with Pupkin's feelings even as we disapprove his methods.
The ending of the movie (I believe there was more than one written and shot) is Scorsese's wit showing through.  Some folks find the ending off-putting but I take it as an ironic punchline, to be enjoyed precisely because it is so provocative.  And the ending makes a good point -- that undeserving nuts sometimes do luck into celebrity, that jerks sometimes do reach the top, and that an American audience at times bestows fame on people who, if they knew them personally, would make their skin crawl.  This in itself is a humorous irony and an excellent point.
KING OF COMEDY is tough to explain, but it is fine work by a great director and cast.  My guess is that people either love this movie or hate it -- there isn't much room in the middle.  This may not make my top ten, but it is definitely on my list of favorites.  It will be in my collection when released on DVD.",982281600,9,3794,4.861801242236025

Martin Scorcese, perhaps in response to these events and in reply to attacks by many critics on ""violence in film"",  created a highly watchable and largely overlooked film about fantasy, fan worship, obsession and neuroses.
Rarely has a film been this fascinating to watch (even on repeated viewings) while at the same time making the viewer so completely uncomfortable in the process.  As Rupert Pupkin (Robert DeNiro) continues to confront talk-show host Jerry Langford (played masterfully by Jerry Lewis), one is completely at a loss to know exactly how far this obsessed fan is going to go.  Though fans of DeNiro probably can guess that he's going to go all the way!  Seldom-seen Sandra Bernhardt is a knockout as Rupert Pupkin's deeply neurotic sidekick.

754703,5,6303982662,"Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy is a loving celebration of Jerry, Johnny  and that gone-forever, pre-cable era when the whole nation gathered nightly  round its TV sets to watch the same show. And it is a disturbing and  intense study of our obsession with celebrity and the lengths we will go to  in order to achieve it or just be near it.
The film draws little  difference between the full-blown insanity of the stalker, Rupert Pupkin  (de Niro), and the everyday celebrity worship of the rest of us. One of the  great scenes is where an old woman begs talk show host Jerry Langford  (Jerry Lewis) for an autograph telling him how she has followed his whole  career; then when he does not have time to talk to her nephew on the  telephone she yells ""I hope you get cancer!""
De Niro's portrayal of  Pupkin is absolutely the best thing he has done, because the character is  so removed from his own now-familiar screen persona. Rupert begins as  ridiculous, becomes deeply disturbing, and ends up incredibly sympathetic  (by the end of the movie, we are as desperate for Rupert to get on the  Langford show as he is). The movie brings out the latent celebrity-stalker  in all of us. It indicts the hollowness of celebrity and lovingly  celebrates its glamour. It satirises the pathology of our pursuit of fame  and proudly shares that same pathology.
Jerry Lewis puts in an amazing  performance as the bitter,suspicious and lonely star, Jerry Langford. The  suspicion that this is an accurate self-portrayal of the real Lewis makes  the performance uncomfortable viewing but also vaguely thrilling. There is  a superb scene where he walks along the streets of New York, arms flapping  comically, hailed by taxi drivers, old women and construction workers. His  paunchy, middle-aged body sits weirdly on skinny legs in drainpipe pants  that still seem to belong to the young Jerry of the 1950s.
Plus a great  cameo by the great, great Tony Randall (surely the Edward Everett Horton of  the late twentieth century). And a wonderful scene portraying the vacuous  egos of TV producers, agents, and lawyers, as they shout over, past and  through each other in their attempt to be bigger, louder and more important  than each other. You know that they would be behaving the same whether  dealing with Jerry's kidnapping or a problem with a guest booking.
And  the fact that Rupert Pupkin's stand-up routine is ultimately quite funny is  one of the best and most unexpected punchlines in the whole movie.

In order to  realize his dream, Pupkin solicits the aid of his wacked-out friend (played  by Sandra Bernhard) in a scheme to kidnap the host of a popular talk-show  (played by the smarmy Jerry Lewis). The film works so well because Pupkin  is clearly untalented (bordering on the offensive in how unfunny he really  is) and there is no possible way to identify or sympathize with his plight.  He is obnoxious, myopic, and quite possibly insane, yet Scorsese forces us  to acknowledge how common his ""sort"" is in our fame-obsessed  culture. Every scene hits the right note; every performance is dead-on; and  each development plausible despite the absurd premise. Still, the stroke of  genius remains the final sequence; sufficiently ambiguous to allow for two  vastly different, yet equally powerful, endings.

7858337,5,6303982662,"Scorsese called this De Niro's greatest performance and I agree--maybe the greatest acting performance ever. Brilliant writing, and spot-on supporting roles from everyone else, from Jerry Lewis' oily and unlikable Jerry Langford and Sandra Bernhard's desperate lunacy and Shelly Hack's restrained contempt all the way to the appalled receptionists at the offices Pupkin haunts. Admittedly it feels a bit dated at this point, the world and NYC were much different nearly 40 years ago, but there is no other movie like this out there. It has just one weak moment, where someone incorrectly thought the sound of a yowling cat would be a funny addition, but other than that I consider it perfect. It's hardly a ""feel good"" movie and definitely not for everyone, but it's a study in brilliant acting and the writing is about as perfect as I've ever seen in a film. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece.",1526342400,,932,4.905063291139241

7858339,3,6303982662,This is a documentary of the time a guy hijacked the Jerry Lewis telethon.  Its hilarious and everyone gives really funny performances including the Asian butler and the Mexican bartender.  it is side splitting humour from the opening credits.  This is Lewis and Martin at their best.  Way funnier then dumb and dumber.,1524355200,,319,4.962264150943396
