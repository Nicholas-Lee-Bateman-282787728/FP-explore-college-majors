Hats off to Ziad Doueiri and crew. The dialogue is as real and as funny as it gets.  This film is a true showcase of adolescence while the kids of Lebanon and their families are trying to cope with the woes of an unfortunate civil war.
A must see for global audiences over 16 years of age.
Vive le Liban.",990748800,2,469,4.211111111111111
1413765,5,B00005ALOX,"This movie shows us how we take simple things in life for granted, we don't realize this until it is taken away.  Teenagers trying to have normal lives during Lebanese Civil War.  Their friendship helps them go through unexpected and sudden changes of their lives.",990316800,,264,4.844444444444444
1413766,4,B00005ALOX,"Finally there is something we can call cinema  , from a lebanese director. I was 14 when the war broke out in Lebanon , and the film best achievement is to try to bring into images that state of mind of gradual descent into chaos , while everyone thinks and acts as if nothing is happening : that is the real tragedy  (and ? blessing) of Lebanon . I wish we saw more , through the cameras eyes , I wish there was less foul language in this film so the younger people can see it ..nevertheless this is a  work made with a lot of talent , heart and humor , and for this Mr Doueiri deserves  appreciation  and acclaim.",989020800,2,615,4.049586776859504
1413767,4,B00005ALOX,"Tarek (Rami Doueiri) is the kind of anarchic class clown who's often ejected from classes by impatient teachers. While exiled to a hallway one afternoon, he looks out a window and sees hooded gunmen slaughter the passengers of a bus. It's April 13, 1975, and Lebanon's civil war has just begun in this semi-autobiographical drama by writer-director Ziad Doueiri (a UCLA-trained filmmaker who has worked as a cinematographer for Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez). With his younger brother cast in the lead role, Doueiri spins an uncommonly compelling coming-of-age story about life and loyalties in a divided city. At first, Tarek and his buddy Omar (Mohammad Chamus) are too caught up in their day-to-day lives, and too happy about the closing of their school, to worry much about the schism between Christian-controlled East Beirut and a West Beirut controlled by Muslim militias. But as the ethnic and religious clashes intensify, Tarek is forced to confront the collateral damage outside his apartment (bombs reduce buildings to rubble, soldiers and snipers control key thoroughfares) and within his family (his parents repeatedly quarrel over whether they should abandon their homeland). ""West Beirut"" is at once vividly detailed and effectively understated as it views war through the eyes of a resourceful teen-ager who's determined to make the best of things in the worst of times.",985824000,8,1394,5.3122171945701355
1413768,4,B00005ALOX,"I liked this movie a lot.  Set in Beirut in 1975, at the start of the Lebanese civil war, it follows the actions of three teenaged friends (two Muslim, one Christian) as their city and country rapidly descend into division and sectarian strife.  There is a lot of humor in it, befitting the resilience of youth, but always in the viewer's mind it is tempered by the awareness that around the young people their world has descended into war and anarchy.  I think anyone interested in modern Lebanon or, more broadly,in the way people adapt and struggle to get by when forces beyond their control take over, would enjoy this witty but sad film.",985824000,5,642,4.614035087719298
7935395,5,B00005ALOX,"This film, nominated in 1999 as Best Foreign film, is a very sweet film about three young people coming of age in Lebanon during civil war.  It does a great job at picking up some of the idiosyncrasies of the Lebanese people, as well as the French under whom they were once ruled.  Its very entertaining, has great music, and does an extraordinary job of conveying the nuances of the society and its societal partitions.  It illustrates religious conflicts while remaining a gentle and humane film.  Even people who don't normally like foreign films should watch this movie because it shows how much more alike we all are than how we are different.",1169164800,,648,4.707964601769912
7935396,5,B00005ALOX,"Beirut 1975. Anarchy and violence surround all the urban environment. The city is under siege, clearly divided in two regions: the Christian and the Muslim, but a brothel is no man's land and is the only demilitarized zone.

The childhood' s dreams can still live in the middle of the wrecking flames, intransigence and public disillusions. Humor and poignancy will invade the implacable crudeness of this uncultured environment.

Nominated in 1999 as Best Foreign film.",1147910400,,470,5.253333333333333
7935397,5,B00005ALOX,"Doueiri's West Beirut is many things. First, it's the best produced and directed Lebanese movie. Second, it's the only film that depicts the outbreak and early days of the Lebanese civil war. Third, it's a lovely drama about the coming of age of three teenagers at the time of the outbreak of the war in 1975. Fourth, it is perhaps the first and only film that captures the realities of daily life and dialogue in Lebanon for it is no doubt the only movie where actors actually use foul language and swear, a feature that is very common among the Lebanese people but is always censored and never seen on film.

However, such a wonderful production should have taken into consideration the minor details that would have made the film even greater. Doueiri knows better that April 13, 1975 fell on a Sunday and accordingly, Beirut schools - unlike in the movie - would have been closed.

Doueiri also should have paid attention to the accent of some of the characters he that presented. One of them who identifies herself as a southerner actually talks with a heavy Beiruti accent. In other instances, cars made in the 1990s appear in the background in some shots. Pictures of Nabih Berri as Speaker of the House can be also seen hanging on the walls in other shots.

Yet, all of these minute discrepancies are far from stripping the film out of its brilliance. The movie is a must see for all those curious about Lebanon and the Middle East.",1138924800,,1440,4.595330739299611
7935398,5,B00005ALOX,"This movie is about the beginning of the civil war in beirut . The director did a great job portraying the life of teenagers , parents , and common people during this period. I had tears in my eyes while i was watching the movie... because i was laughing so hard. Ziad doueiri gathered a brilliant cast , that didn't need to act a role but rather paraphrase their lives in the movie. This movie is one the happiest dramas you can watch, and it will give you true insight on how it is to grow during wartime .",1079654400,3,508,4.141414141414141
7935399,5,B00005ALOX,"This movie was amazing and when I watched it back in 1999, it really moved me. Eversince then I had begun to appreciate movies as forms of communication and not just hollywood entertainment. It was raw and real. As a Kiwi-Arab, I truly can relate to this, and recommend to all estranged Arabs as well as anyone interested in Arab society. i am only sad that I can't find anymore movies he had directed.",1060473600,5,402,4.445945945945946
7935400,5,B00005ALOX,"Summary: EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a WONDERFUL movie, it is a historical glimpse on Lebanon, 1975, through the eyes of a teenager. If (usually) U.S. citizens ask themselves ""how can ""those people"" live in ""those countries""? This is the perfect answer to it. When you have a LIFE, FRIENDS, FAMILY, when you don't believe that things can be changed, when life is LIKE THAT, you accept things that you cannot change.
The protagonist (EXCELLENT actor Rami Doueiri) goes through life as a happy go lucky teenager, used to living under such political changes, but untouched by them. In this movie of ""coming of age"", you can follow him in his seamless transition into adulthood: the realization of what life has became.
PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE - IT IS A MUST SEE - from any angle that you may want to look at it. You will gain different undertanding of things that you probably had before, if you are not a citizen from Lebanon, watch it and learn something.",1053129600,4,970,4.711764705882353
7935401,4,B00005ALOX,"How many of us, Americans, have been exposed to foreign cinematography?  Or, let us narrow the question.  How many of us, Americans, have been exposed to cinematography from the Muslim countries?  Not too many.  And, basically, we have very little knowledge and understanding of this area of art.  I was fortunate to view over my lifetime maybe a dozen of films from Egypt, Syria, Turkey and Iran.  Let me tell you, I did not waste my time.  It was worth it.
This time I came across of the movie called ""West Beirut"".  I am not going to tell you a story.  It is up to you to see it.  One family and three young friends take almost all of it. War.  Christians and Muslims fight each for reasons not too many can understand.  Palestinians shoot in all directions killing everyone in sight.  Muslim religious fractions fight each other for the power.  Israel is forces to enter the civil war in order to protect the own borders.  One family and three young friends are in the thick of it.  Pain, sadness and the unforgettable Middle Eastern humor make thin film to stand out and to be noticeable.  It is well written and filmed, and well acted as well, of cause, considering the budget and the locations limitations.  I enjoyed it so much believing that this part of the world was not lost for civilization and these people one day soon would raise again as a great nation.",1045872000,3,1370,4.5
7935402,5,B00005ALOX,"I am a Lebanese and I lived through a good part of the war. This movie captures the essence of the war, its smell, its shock, the fear, and portrays them through the life of a family and teenage friends. This movie reflected the every day life that I, my family, and my relatives went through. The focus of the movie is not the war itself as some might think, but rather the the lives of the people and how they dealt with it every day. There were several instances where my reaction was, ""Oh my God, we went through the exact same thing!"".",1040601600,2,540,4.201923076923077
7935403,5,B00005ALOX,"Director and writer Ziad Doveiri has taken his lessons as part of the camera crew of Tarantino's films to produce an excellent first film. Autobiographical in nature, the UCLA trained Doveiri creates a coming of age movie, under the harsh conditions of war torn Lebanon in 1975. The film focuses primarily on the friendships of three teenagers, the outrageous Tarek , played by Ziad's real life brother, his best buddy Omar, who is a short, wisecracking, aspiring super 8 young filmaker, and the lovely ""virgin mary"" May who is a Catholic orphan. The Civil War that plagued Lebanon from 1975-1990 disrupts the search for identity but the trio try inspite of war to live a normal life even without school and Muslim patrolled streets. The parents have roles in the movie, often characterized by political statements like when Tarek's father reacts to the start of the war by saying, ""the United States will send some people over here to straighten things out."" The war progresses to the point where the parents cannot ignore the consequences of how life has changed.  The boys are the primary focus however and their adventures are the real heart of the movie. They try to be typical tenagers listening to rock and roll, daydreaming about sex, smoking cigarettes and fantasizing about the future but the events make it harder to have ""fun.""  The division of the city into Christian East and Muslim West provides the impetus for some hilarious adventures, which includes visiting a brothel, a confrontation with a driver and a neighbor, participation in a demonstration that they don't anything about and many more wacky situations. The child actors are terrific and very natural, giving a sense of realism to the movie that is even more evident with the interspersing of actual footage from the war. Life goes on in spite of the civil war and Ziad portrays the innocence of lost youth is universal even under the worst conditions. In light of recent world events and the focus on the Middle East, this film is a particularly interesting portrait of what it is like when worlds collide.",1005091200,5,2084,4.8841807909604515
7935404,5,B00005ALOX,"As a Lebanese-American this film helped me to realize what my people in Lebanon had to deal with during the war.  It shows the difficulty of living a normal life in the land that you love during a horrible war.  Even though it is a sad movie, the typical Lebanese humor helps to lighten up the scene.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Lebanon, the Middle East, or in a good movie in general.  It also helped to brush up on my Arabic.",998352000,5,447,4.223529411764706
