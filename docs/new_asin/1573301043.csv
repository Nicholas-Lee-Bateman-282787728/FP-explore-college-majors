191177,5,1573301043,"The whole show really embraced all these diva's talents..all are talented, Celine has a powerful voice and a great singer, Aretha Frankin is the queen of soul, Shania Twain is great with her country twang, and Gloria Estefan  has raised latin music to the next level...but the real show was Mariah  Carey!  Mariah pretty much stole the show with her great vocal diva  skills as usual and she sang with such power and resilience.  Mariah is  truly the best diva of all time (although some will disagree) but that is  what I think..Go Mariah!  Mariah Carey is superb always and  forever, she does the best duets too...especially with Aretha on this DVD.  MARIAH CAREY IS DA BOMB!

191189,5,1573301043,"When funding for school music classes were being cut all over the country people kind of brushed it off as a non-necessity.  Studies prooved that many kids prosper in other academic subjects when taking a music class.  Art should be available for all kids in school as well as sports.  This benefit concert brought awareness to that.  Mariah, Celine, Gloria & Shania all appeard to support the cause.  And of course Ms. Aretha Franklin.  The performnaces were great.  Carol King was brought out as a special guest of Celine Dion.  The best part of the show was when the diva's sang You've Got A Friend and Natural Woman.  This show sounds even better with the 5.1 sound.",1173571200,7,670,4.6581196581196584

- Great looking divas

- Great performances

- Shania Twain (she's the best in the concert for me)

and of course, appearances by Jennifer Aniston and Patricia Arquette

191192,4,1573301043,"I thought that this was a great way to start off a series of shows to save the music. But what most people don't know is that it was an unofficial tribute to Aretha Franklin, as noted by VH-1. And righfully so, Aretha is the original diva. her vocals aren't what they were, but she still delivers in a way that leave you breathless. She dominated the stage. All of the other ladies were good as well, but they lack the confidence that Aretha has, which i'm sure comes from a killer voice and also a lifetime of singing.",1137888000,2,519,4.252525252525253
191193,3,1573301043,"WOW! what a spectacualur performance by all these divas!  Its refreshing to watch a show were you know the people are actually all singing.  What talent they ALL possess!  My favorite of the show was the ""Natural Woman"" performance... Celine Dion really blew me away in this one (not that i have ever heard her sing a bad note in my life!) Definatly recommended to anyone who enjoys soaring vocals true talent; excellent show!",1134950400,3,426,4.72972972972973
191194,5,1573301043,"I just can't understand why everybody tries to run down Mariah, Celine and the rest of these singers. Why can't you just accept that everyone of them is a brilliant singer and that it just depends on one's personal taste whether one prefers one singer over the other. I Myself like Mariah best and it's ridiculous to hear a voice student say that Mariah has lost her voice: her voice has always sounded like this, perhaps you should listen to mtv unplugged! Or has she lost her voice even before mtv unplugged? Apart from that a voice doesn't have to be clear in order to be a nice/good voice: Or would you say Tina Turner can't sing just because her voice is not as clear as Celine's??

I really enjoyed listening to this music and I can recommend this product to everyone who loves real music!!",1132185600,5,796,4.4520547945205475
191195,5,1573301043,"When I ordered this, I thought I was ordering the one where Celine Dion sings AC/DC (I guess I lost track of how many Divas Lives there were), but I have no regrets!  With so many lip synchers out there, it was nice to see a whole concert where you knew everyone was singing - and REALLY well, too!  Shania was awesome, and Celine, with her playing the ""congas"" on the piano and her air guitar solo -- I love it!",1126224000,3,412,4.074074074074074
191196,3,1573301043,"Not bad, although lets see, you have 3 ""divas"" trying to outscream and steal the show from each other, which becomes embarrassingly more evident as the show goes on. Riiiiight.

The real star of this show was Shania Twain. She actually writes her own material, concentrates on singing with heart instead of screaming and she can play guitar while performing....plus she doesn't have an ego like the rest of the performers and didn't try to upstage anyone *cough*Celine*cough* although as far as talent and attitude is concerned, Shania clearly outshined the rest.",1116201600,4,563,5.119565217391305
191197,1,1573301043,"I watched this when it first aired and needless to say I was disgusted. I was a fan of Gloria Estefan, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey and had hopes the three of them would be on a stage together. When it finally happened the results sickened me. My first complaint was that Mariah Carey added that hideous remix to her song My All that RUINS it.

My second complaint was with the finale. Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey were trying to outscream each other while Gloria and Shania Twain were left in the dust. It was childish behavior by three grown women who should have known better.",1104019200,5,596,4.467889908256881
191198,5,1573301043,"I liked this DVD from the minute it started, but I particularly LOVED it when Celine took the stage, she was GREAT!!! And not talking about her duet with Carole King (another great singer). I also loved Celine, Gloria and Shania singing along with Carole ""You've got a friend"", it was absolutely wonderful. And the end, GOD!!! THE END!!!! When all the divas sing ""A Natural Woman"" and Aretha and Celine sing ""Testimony"", was absolutely incredible!!! About what some of you said, that Celine ruined the show and that she isn't a diva, COME ON PEOPLE!!!! GIVE HER A BREAK!!!! She DIDN'T ruined the show, no one did!! All of them were GREAT!!! (specially Celine and Aretha) Oh! and please don't say that Celine was trying too hard to reach the high notes, 'cause she WASN'T. I think that Mariah has lost her voice a little bit, 'cause SHE was the one trying too hard to reach the high notes, although she sounded good too, I mean not as good as I expected but good anyway, everyone did.
Anyway... GREAT show, GREAT DVD, GREAT singers, all the Divas in one stage, absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!",1081382400,5,1084,4.6217616580310885
191199,5,1573301043,"VH1 had decided to put together a benefit concert that was to help raise the money for the Save The Music Foundation. In 1998, they had their first charity concert entitled, ""VH1 Divas Live '98"". They have chosen five female solo acts to perform in this concert. Those five women are: Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, Aretha Franklin, Shania Twain, & Mariah Carey. Carole King was also invited to this concert, but only as a guest diva. These five women helped redefine the meaning of listening to music and it is all defined right here.

  Mariah Carey is the first two perform. She comes out, wearing a beautiful white sparkling gown, and performs, ""My All"". Just as the song nears the end, the song goes into a dance remix, where Mariah closes out the song. After ""My All"", Mariah then sings, ""Make it Happen"", a song that she had written about how she made it to where she is now.

  Gloria Estefan then takes the stage, wearing a longer silver gown. Gloria sings ""Heaven's What I Feel"", the first single off her 1998 dance-fused album, ""Gloria"". After ""Heaven's What I Feel"", Gloria then sings, ""Turn The Beat Around"". After those two brilliant songs, Gloria performs an awesome Megamix Medley. The medley consists of, ""Dr. Beat"", ""Conga"", ""Rhythm Is Gonna Get You"", ""1-2-3"", & ""Get On Your Feet"".

  Shania Twain then takes the stage, wearing a black sparkling half-top and black pants. First, Shania sings, ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman"". After that, she sits on a stool and, while playing an acoustic guitar, sings, ""You're Still The One"".

  Aretha Franklin then takes the stage to perform, wearing a black party gown. Only, Aretha is not alone. Mariah Carey is with her. The two perform Aretha's hit song, ""Chain Of Fools"" and they sing it brilliantly.

  Celine Dion comes out to the stage, wearing a black suit and black coat. She is joined by Carole King, where they sing Celine Dion's song, ""The Reason"". Carole King leaves the stage after, ""The Reason"", where Celine performs, ""River Deep, Mountain High"", followed by, ""My Heart Will Go On"".

  A piano is wheeled out. Playing the piano is Carole King. Leaning on the side of the piano is Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, & Shania Twain. The three sing, ""You've Got A Friend"". Carole not only plays the piano, but sings with Celine, Gloria, & Shania. For the finale, Celine, Gloria, Aretha, Shania, Mariah, & Carole take center stage to perform, ""(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman"" and ""Testimony"".

  These women gave one hell of a concert, proving that they are Divas. I just hope that for the divas of 2005, they'll choose: Madonna, Roberta Flack, Toni Braxton, Taylor Dayne, Melissa Etheridge, & Annie Lennox. The whole selist for VH1 Divas Live '98 and the Divas of '98 line-up are listed below:

191200,4,1573301043,"Celine Dion is definitely the biggest highlight from the first ever Divas Live. Her solo performances of River Deep, Mountain High and My Heart Will Go On are impeccable. Everyone agrees that her My Heart Will Go On performance on this show is one of her best and most memorable yet. She also does The Reason with Carole King. Shania Twain performing Man! I Feel Like A Woman! and You're Still The One also contributes to making this show better than it would have been with incredibly mediocre Gloria Estefan, incredibly annoying Mariah Carey, and incredibly over hyped Aretha Franklin. MARIAH CAREY IS NOT A GREAT SINGER!!!!!!!!
It was awesome to see Celine rightfully upstage Aretha in the finale. Classic. Aretha may be the Queen Of Soul(ick) but Celine Dion is the Queen of ALL singers! The Canadians rule the day here, folks!",1070409600,,831,4.818181818181818
191201,4,1573301043,"I agree with most of the professional music writers that Aretha Franklin was the ONLY true ""diva"" on that stage at the Beacon Theatre.
The other women were diva-wanna-bes and ALL seemed intimidated by the undisputed Queen of Soul.  They had  reason to be a little afraid, Franklin took command of the stage and the show!  I wish she had sung a couple of alternative songs, but she knew she could take it easy with this group. If Franklin had to deal with Patti LaBelle, Natalie Cole and Bettye LaVette, you would have seen SOME show!
When she decided she'd had enough, she left her co-stars behind, fighting to wave away the dust.  During ""A Natural Woman,"" it became The Aretha Franklin Show, with Sister Ree dominating the proceedings (with Celine Dion trying desperately to stay afloat).  She drowned.
Aretha went into a surprise gospel number (""Testimony"") which none of the other singers knew.  They dutifully transformed into background dancers and handclappers as Franklin sailed forward.
All in all, I enjoyed the show, but calling Shania, Mariah, Gloria and Celine ""divas"" just makes a joke of that word.",1066435200,5,1113,4.8936170212765955
191202,5,1573301043,"From the start I really wanted to see whos who(Mariah or Celine)
well, watch the divas as they perform ""A Natural Woman"" youll see that Mariah gets the high notes so natural, while Celine shouts just to reach the notes! And Mariah sings her part very different of all the divas. It's the ""Princess of Soul"" singing with her ""Queen"" a powerful combination!!!!!!",1063670400,2,360,4.73015873015873
191203,5,1573301043,"Celine was wonderful in this VH1 Save the Music.  Yes, Celine was the best of all the singers.  She made it come alive and not boring like some of the others.  Celine is my favorite singer.  And will always be.  The other singers were great to don't get me wrong but i still think Celine was the best.  Thank you Celine Dion, Gloria, and all the other singers for Helping Save The Music In School.  You all rock... :)",1061942400,,417,4.2025316455696204
191204,5,1573301043,"All divas were doing well, but they just sing like playing their CD though this is much better than many other singers. I only saw Aretha Franklin and Mariah singing like ""Diva Live"" and have a lot surprises. Mariah also did a great and fun address than the other divas. She also saved a little power in ""Chain, Chain, Chain"" with Aretha Franklin. Both legend singer and writers (Aretha Franklin and Carole King) gave her the most attention. Obviously, Mariah lead the other divas. It is a pity that she seem not focus on music so much as before.",1053302400,4,546,4.525252525252525
191205,5,1573301043,This is a great video for any Mariah Carey fan... As we all know Mariah Carey is the best selling female artist of all time. While Mariah gives hands down the best preformance...

Gloria Estefan.... give good preformances also.... but Celine dion Ruins the show (Thank god for the fast forward button) other then her preformance The show is AMAZING... and Mariah is the best!,1052438400,5,410,4.956521739130435
191206,4,1573301043,"I saw this special VH1 and I have to say, Celine is the best!  Mariah Carey is great too and so is Shania, to each their own style.  Obviously, Celine - for far the best- and Mariah -used to be better with her older material - have the most incredible singing voices in this much needed music industry.
I have to say, buy this CD for Celine and Mariah, the others are compliment them and make for a good show.",1045094400,3,409,4.1
191207,5,1573301043,"I think that Celine Dion screams at the top of her lungs just so she can be heard over everyone in Natural Woman.  Otherwise this DVD and CD are good Mariah Carey is the bestest singer in the world and is the only one that acted, dressed like a ""diva"".

191211,5,1573301043,"Celine, Shania, and Gloria were perfect. What else could they be? Seeing them together and later finding out that they all became friends is really pleasing to know. Aretha on the other hand is so bad that they cut out a  couple of her solo songs. Mariah shows her true Diva side in this. Watch  when all Divas are on stage. Mariah gives Celine some sassy attitude...what  a shocker for Mariah.",960422400,6,394,4.52112676056338
