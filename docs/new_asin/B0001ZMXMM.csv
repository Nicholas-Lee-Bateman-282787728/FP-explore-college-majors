2046987,4,B0001ZMXMM,"I originally got this movie from the Bridgestone collection, but it wasn't the best quality. I was looking for a better version since Idaho is one of my favorite movies with Roy Rogers. This Alpha Video version is definitely better quality, both sound and graphics, than the Bridgestone version.

However, I do have one small gripe with the Alpha version. Around the 40 minute mark, there's about 20 seconds missing as they splice two scenes together. I checked the Bridgestone version and they have those 20 missing seconds in their copy of the movie. Not a huge deal as it's only 20 seconds, but still kind of annoying to have that kind of sloppy splicing there. For this reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I still think it's worth the money I spent and would recommend the Alpha Video over the Bridgestone version due to the superior quality of the Alpha DVD.",1411689600,4,867,4.587096774193548
2046988,5,B0001ZMXMM,Great movie.  Love the action and the interaction between the main characters.  They just don't make family friendly movies like this anymore.  A must for any Roy Rogers fan.,1389484800,,174,4.931034482758621
2046989,5,B0001ZMXMM,"I read other reviews before purchasing this movie and I agree that this is one of the best acting movies of Roy Rogers.  In 1992 I missed getting to meet Roy by 10 minutes, always regretted this.",1355529600,,195,4.27027027027027
2046990,5,B0001ZMXMM,"I love the B westerns, guess being a baby boomer, they bring back fond memories of a more simple way of life.  The video and audio are very good on this video.  Sometimes one orders a title from other companies, and even though they say they are remastered, it is hard to believe. However this company did an excellent job, and I would not hesitate to purchase another one.",1331683200,2,373,4.391304347826087
2046991,5,B0001ZMXMM,Having ninety three of 117 of Roy's movies taken from imdb.com I've been trying to completely get them all so I got the chance to purchase this one at a reasonable price. Everyone should sit back & enjoy a good Roy Roger movie as you watch there is a moral to each of his movies & wouldn't hurt the world to live by.,1292198400,5,316,4.031746031746032
2046992,5,B0001ZMXMM,"The transfer quality of this feature length version of IDAHO is outstanding. The picture is so sharp and crisp it looks like 35mm film when projected on a large movie screen. The original source material was a little splicey but not disturbing. The beautiful picture quality more than makes up for any slight splice jumps. I was thrilled when I watched this DVD. Great job, Alpha Video! Keep up the good work!",1247184000,6,409,4.694444444444445
