7884688,5,6305191794,"An appetizing and seductive comedy that centers around the friendship and  tangled love lives of two young San Francisco women: the hopeful comedian  and sexually carefree lesbian Kira (Kathleen Fontaine) and her best bud  Sydney (Tara Howley), a food-obsessed straight woman with self esteem  issues. With only stage fright keeping her from a successful stand-up  comedy career, the dark-haired beauty Kira drowns her professional problems  by going to bed with a bevy of nearly nameless babes. Kira later recounts  all the gory bedroom details to an half amused half bewildered Sydney, a  gal who'd rather eat her candy and cake than to bother with a relationship.  But just when Kira thinks she's fallen in love (with the lovely Desi del  Valle) she finds herself stalked (in that age old Fatal Attraction fashion)  by Katie (Machiko Saito), a deranged and delusional former one-night stand.  Will Kira find inspiration and stability in a loving relationship or will  the calculating Katie do something to ruin what could be a happy ending?  Hmmmm.
A delirious mix of sexual entanglements, modern day melodrama and  tantelizing humor.",961891200,51,1137,5.204419889502763
