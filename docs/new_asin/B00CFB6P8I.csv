5720989,3,B00CFB6P8I,"Not as good as the preview, the description was misleading.  This movie was about making right decisions, it had nothing to do about a pastor stealing from a church.",1389657600,,165,4.689655172413793
5720990,5,B00CFB6P8I,The movie was very very good mainly because of the message. It makes it plain and simple yet something that will continue to make you think. I recommended it and posted it to my personal reviews page thats shared with many to see how various products are.,1389225600,,255,4.446808510638298
5720991,3,B00CFB6P8I,"The Synopsis states that the family that has been giving all of their money to the church finds out the pastor is spending it all and that is not what this play was about. It was about trusting in God even when things are down. They talked a great deal about prosperity preachers, mostly negative, but in the end prayer works and the family was prosperous. The editing was a bit off but the message was still good.",1388793600,6,414,4.32051282051282
5720992,2,B00CFB6P8I,The camera was shaky in several cuts and the singing wasn't very good. The message is good but the bad editing creates a disconnect between the message and the audience. There weren't seamless transitions and it made it hard to follow. The audience seemed unhappy and uncomfortable.,1383782400,,282,5.0212765957446805
5720993,2,B00CFB6P8I,For Once Robin Givens is the only bright spot in this filmed play.  I could not watch the  entire play and even the FILMED  PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE HAD UNHAPPY LOOKS ON THEIR FACES!!!!!,1380844800,3,184,4.352941176470588
5720994,3,B00CFB6P8I,this actually wasn't a bad play... singing could have been better... but I was happy it wasn't to much singing. the message in the play does make you question yourself...who do you trust? God or money? and are you willing to just trust him?,1379289600,,240,4.4772727272727275
5720995,5,B00CFB6P8I,"I really like this movie, I recommended the movie to family and friends. My grandkids really liked it cause it was very informative and explained. the made subject very well. exactly what I expected.",1379116800,,199,4.882352941176471
5720996,1,B00CFB6P8I,"This play was sooooo bad; and very misleading. With a few laughs here and there, Overall, this play gets 1 star for:  bad acting, ( with the exception of Robin Givens,Darrius McCary and the actor who played the grandfather) unrealistic and poor storyline, poor singing( mainly,from the actors who played, the mom and dad in the play). And two huge let downs for me was: Darrius McCary, didn't sing one song , and the twisting of scripture.",1377993600,3,439,4.701298701298701

5720998,1,B00CFB6P8I,"Basically a play about harvest based preaching in church that has become popular today from preachers. I'm not sure if this play gives off the right message, and it doesn't do a good job of being entertaining other than a couple of cheap laughs here and there.",1457308800,4,260,4.553191489361702

5721004,2,B00CFB6P8I,I'm not fond of movies that are videos of stage plays. Would not have gotten this one if I had known in advance.,1433116800,,112,3.9130434782608696
5721005,4,B00CFB6P8I,"Gotta pay attention to get the answer to the question, ""Will a man rob God?""  But it was a powerful message for me.  I thought the father would get a huge revelation, but overall it was good for a play.",1429574400,,202,4.025

5721011,5,B00CFB6P8I,At first I was determined not to like the play but as it went on- I found the play to be encouraging and insightful. I will be recommending this to everyone I know,1417305600,,163,3.9696969696969697

5721013,4,B00CFB6P8I,Movie kept my attention. Film had very surprising ending. You expect one thing from reading review but in the end you get a very nice surprise.,1409616000,,143,4.538461538461538
5721014,5,B00CFB6P8I,"I believe this is a great movie about things believers go through in life.  But if we just wait on God,  He will bring us through life victoriously.",1408924800,,148,4.25
5721015,1,B00CFB6P8I,"The movie's description is way off-- it has absolutely nothing to do with a pastor stealing from his church. Overall, the message was not encouraging.  The message it sends is that if you tithe regularly, pray to God, and speak in ""Christian-ese"" language, God will grant your wishes and take care of any financial troubles you may be dealing with.  The prosperity gospel was glorified in the movie, emphasizing that God promises to bless us financially if we tithe faithfully and have faith in Him, but the truth is that God never promised us a life without financial struggles, and it is also true that we are not always going to get everything that we want, which is a message that is not portrayed in this movie.  (spoiler alert) At the end of the movie, one of the main characters prays for God to give her favor, and she gets a 30 million dollar deal with Microsoft... not impossible, but if she had not gotten this deal, it wouldn't be because she didn't pray the right prayer.  He didn't owe her anything... I could go on for days, but as a Christian, I felt the need to say that this play was not by any means an accurate depiction of the true gospel of Christ.",1407110400,11,1170,4.427906976744186
5721016,4,B00CFB6P8I,"I love the plot, acting and the passion. The object of to whom the passion was directed was inspirational!",1404777600,,106,4.631578947368421
5721017,1,B00CFB6P8I,This movie was not well acted out. It didn't meet my expectations. The picture quality was awful. Acting was amateurish and downright waste of viewers' time really,1404000000,,163,5.074074074074074
5721018,3,B00CFB6P8I,"But, it has a good message. The acting is not bad. Robin Givens is in a very small portion of the movie.",1403222400,,104,3.772727272727273
5721019,4,B00CFB6P8I,A good story line with excellent actors. The audio could have been better.  At times we couldn't clearly understand what they were saying.,1401148800,,138,5.0
5721020,5,B00CFB6P8I,"The production was weak but the message makes up for all of that... For those of you who think that this is just a ""movie"" Just know that God is able to do that and more... I loved the play and everything that it stood for. I too am experiencing something similar to the story line and it has encouraged me to keep on believing not that GOD can because we already know that,  but knowing that He will. Be encouraged",1400803200,,415,4.1234567901234565
5721021,4,B00CFB6P8I,"i'm glad i didn't let the bad reviews stop me from watching this play.  it's pretty good.

it's true that the camera work was a bit iffy and an actor or two fluffed their lines.  it's also true that amazon's description has nothing to do with what happens in this play  -  it sounds like a description of another video  -  and that the cover is misleading since givens and mccrary's characters have nothing to do with each other.  they were never even onstage at the same time.  (a montage including other significant characters would have been better.)  still, i think it was worth watching.

viewers should keep in mind that this is a recording of a live stage play.  errors get cleaned up in movies and tv shows.  in a play, you get one take.  that's it.

another thing to consider is that audience reactions shouldn't have that much to do with what you think about what's going on.  sound equipment may not have been devoted to picking up laughter from what seems to be a small group of theatergoers.  that shot of an apparently bored audience member should have ended up on the cutting room floor.

as for the lack of music, this isn't a musical.  we've grown accustomed to religious-themed plays having big name voices to help power sales, but the few people who sang in this play were good, especially given what was happening.  a tender, heartfelt version of ""thank you lord"" is sung by mama jean and her husband.  the fact that nate jones is not a singer while evangeline young's performance is probably scaled back a bit takes nothing away from the beauty of their rendition of the song.  it isn't meant to sound like some big, lavish production.

one last thing:  i like the way darius mccrary's acting abilities have matured over the years.  he's good.  very good.  his was one of several excellent performances in this play, and none of the performances qualified as horrible.

i liked it, and i'll probably watch it again one day.",1398384000,3,1944,4.5726744186046515
5721022,5,B00CFB6P8I,It hit home I loved it. I watched it more than once and showed it to others. I will continue to recommend it.,1397088000,,109,3.782608695652174
5721023,1,B00CFB6P8I,"The caption for the movie says this: ""A family who grew up donating money to their local church, comes to the realization that the pastor is stealing every dollar of it.""  Yet the film promotes the Blab It & Grab It garbage gospel of prosperity preached by False Profits and Pimping Preachers.  Do not watch this crap if you believe in the real Gospel --- which is the Good News that God gave His only begotten son, Jesus the Christ, that whosoever believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.  The Gospel is not about prosperity, and if any one comes to you with this counterfeit crap, God says to call them accursed.  Gal 1:3-8  ""Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,  (4)  Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:  (5)  To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  (6)  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:  (7)  Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.  (8)  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.""",1392076800,3,1268,4.291139240506329

5721025,5,B00CFB6P8I,"This was very good play! Here is the reason that the other reviews are poor. Yes there was bad acting at parts, misread lines at parts, horrible singing at parts as the other reviews have noted. However, the message is what was most important. That stood out like very well. The picture and title using Robin's name to promote is clearly used to hype the play up, but I am glad that they did what they had to do to get this message out there. There is no pastor stealing money in this story. He is accused of stealing money the entire play.",1390348800,,540,4.252427184466019

8581206,1,B00CFB6P8I,"The description is misleading and Robin Givens is in it for less than 5 minutes. It's a play that suppprts prosperity preaching, not about a preacher that robs his church.",1505347200,,171,4.733333333333333
8581207,5,B00CFB6P8I,"The message here was right on...sure it shows to be a low budget film but the power of the message won me over. Don't. Give. Up. On. God. Stay faithful, it truly is hard and the alternative is always easier...but that is just satan's venom...",1500508800,,242,4.4
