8197828,5,B000QUUD3I,"Yes, my opinion is bias since I'm related to Casanova, but it is still a really funny movie.  The surfing is cool too, especially the locations.
I think my favorite part is the weed-wacker sound used when the van is in motion!!",1364256000,,227,4.404761904761905

8197830,5,B000QUUD3I,"Perfect for a night with friends....drinking beer, and mining the stoke! Nice longboarding waves, with a dash of shortboard...the other reviewer was right; This movie is more about the awesome plot, and super cheap special effects. Blast it!!",1321660800,,242,5.394736842105263
8197831,5,B000QUUD3I,"I forget where exactly I heard about this movie, but I bought it a while back from their website. It is one of the funniest, weirdest, and most enjoyable surf movies I have seen. The surfing itself is nothing too exciting aside from some slow rolling longboard waves (with maybe like three shortboard waves thrown in there), but the plot and acting is awesome. If you buy this and you surf or have an odd sense of humor, you will not be disappointed.",1217376000,4,450,4.433734939759036
