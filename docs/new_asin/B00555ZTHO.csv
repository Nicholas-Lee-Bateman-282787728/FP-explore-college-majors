4572214,1,B00555ZTHO,"I fell in love with Sasha Alexander on the T,V. show,""Rizzoli & Isles"". She's the only reason I bought this movie. I fell out of love with her about 20 minutes or so into this dud of a movie. She does a GREAT acting job on the T.V. show and to be kind, stick with the T.V. show and stay away from the ""B"" movies.",1371168000,,312,3.8153846153846156
4572215,5,B00555ZTHO,"Hit man takes last job and falls for his mark. Sounds cliche and totally predictable, However the film was so well done, and the performances were so excellent that it is worth more than one viewing. I was really surprised and cheered by the quality of this movie. Sizemore, as always, was terrific. Sasha Alexander and Bill Smitrovich, the other leads, were also excellent. I also like the fact that there is no pat ending to the story.
I was surprised at the quality of the movie because the it was done when Sizemore had already damaged his career with very well documented substance abuse/relationship problems. However, his enormous talent clearly remains intact. This is an absorbing, worthwhile video for your collection.",1364428800,,728,4.975409836065574
4572216,3,B00555ZTHO,"Tom Sizemore plays a hitman who is lonely and lives on a fringes of life.  His life is empty and he suffers from insomnia.  It is not likely that he is remorseful about his profession, it is rather that he realizes he is aging and his retirement days have little or no prospect for his future.

Before long, he lands a great job that can help him start fresh.  His job is to kill a pretty librarian.  That is where story gets a little muggy - she is stalked by her ex-boyfriend, she lives in a mansion owned by her wealthy friends who spend half year in their other home in Bahamas.  During the day she works at the local library and in her spare time she practices shooting (I do not think I ever heard of librarian who goes shooting in her spare time)...

It seems that this pretty librarian has charm that lonely hitman finds difficult to resist.  They recognise similaries between each other lifestyles and they bond.  As their relationship becomes personal, it becomes apparent that this hitman will do whatever it takes to get the best of two worlds: collect his fee and keep the girl.  You must see the movie to find out how he does it...",1343001600,,1145,4.3584905660377355
4572217,5,B00555ZTHO,"Jack Price (Tom Sizemore) is a freelance hitman who can create his own opportunities. Personality wise he is dry and realizes he is not a social butterfly. He saves the daughter (Sprague Grayden) of a millionaire (Bill Smitrovich) only to ransom her himself. Months later, needing a hitman, our millionaire manages to find Price and make him an offer he can't refuse: one million dollars to kill Sarah (Sasha Alexander), a nice pretty librarian in a small town called Homewood.

Neither we nor Price knows why he wants her dead. It is a mystery that we find out about midway...but too late. Price has already saved her twice from attackers and has grown fond of the librarian. Oh what to do, what to do.

I considered the movie to be 4 stars until the ending...the final scene...the look on Sasha's face. The irony of it all.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1336694400,,853,4.635761589403973
4572218,5,B00555ZTHO,"For those who read Max Allen Collins ""Quarry"" novels, this may or may not flick your bic but I liked it.  Better than most novels adapted for the screen, it follows one of Quarry's escapades (sorry, the title escapes me right now and my bookshelf is miles away) pretty closely.  Sizemore is good as Quarry but a bit rough around the edges.  Overall worth watching and I wish they would do more with this character.  A smart mans Hit Man.  I wouldn't mind him meeting up with Lawrence Block's ""Keller"".  That would be a nice body count!",1330387200,,535,4.463917525773196
4572219,3,B00555ZTHO,"Acting appears to be good.  Script is fine - my problem is that the sound is very muddled and there are no closed captions - in 2011!!!  Don't have a ""home theater"", just off the rack TV speakers and always watch with captions.  Missed a lot of the movie because of this.",1320451200,3,271,4.173076923076923
4572220,4,B00555ZTHO,"I have no idea where this movie came from. I don't remember the title or if it received a theatrical release but it was a joy to watch.

Here's the scoop. Tom Sizemore plays Price, a contract hit man, whose conscience is catching up with him. He cannot sleep and walks around in a constant twilight. He takes on a job to kill a young woman, Sarah (played by Sasha Alexander), who he ends up falling for. So what's a hit man supposed to do in a situation like this?

This is not a new plot line. What this movie has going for it is the way the story plays out and the performances. I like Sizemore. I think he has a natural ability on screen. And though he may not be the best actor around he does a fine job here. He walks around in a near daze and he can't keep his eyes open past half way, but he knows his craft. He's smart. He's always a step ahead of a given situation. Sasha Alexander is good as Sarah. She's young, bright and lovely. She has a good sense of humor, but she's troubled. Like Price, she has a hard time sleeping at night. There's a lovely pain watching these two draw closer to one another. So why is she on a hit list? You don't find out until the third act and I liked how that worked.

This is shot in norther Louisiana and it has a good look. It's shot in a way to bolster the sense of loneliness and weariness felt by the two main characters. All the production values are good enough so the viewer doesn't see the bones. This is just an all over good watch. You may disagree with the ending. I don't know if I thought it was great, but I didn't mind it at all.

If you're at all predisposed toward this sort of movie this is well worth your time.",1317859200,,1673,4.045317220543807
4572221,5,B00555ZTHO,"I almost wanted to give this video 4 stars but thought back and made it 5. This is because the hired killer is likeable and the situation the video puts him in is believable. His ""love"" who gets him in trouble and later becomes a target, makes for some great thrills and surprise switches. Watch it and enjoy the great acting, story and unfolding drama.",1317859200,,353,4.446153846153846
4572222,5,B00555ZTHO,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised while watching this film.  Was quickly wrapped up in the story of an ex-hit man who gets roped back into his old way of life to carry out one more job.  Really strong performances by Tom Sizemore (from HEAT and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) -- the best he's been in years -- and the lovely Sasha Alexander (TNT'S RIZZOLI & ISLES).  Supporting cast including Sprague Grayden (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2), Bill Smitrovich (IRON MAN), Ray McKinnon (THE BLIND SIDE), and Randall Batinkoff (KICK ASS) all add strong character work as well.  In terms of direction, cinematography and editing, it's definitely among the best independent films I've seen this year.  If you like a well made noir/thriller, don't miss THE LAST LULLABY!",1316044800,8,752,4.889763779527559
4572223,1,B00555ZTHO,"Inept direction crippled this muddled mess of a film. Too bad, because Sizemore is great when directed well, but Goodman has a long way to go before creating a film that really jells. And Alexander needs to take a few drinks or smoke a doobie or something, I mean, come on, babe, loosen up, huh?

So, what's wrong with the film? It's disjointed. It fights itself and each scene negates the last. All poor Sizemore does is shoot, sulk, skulk and shuffle around like a street drunk. Fifteen minutes is spent to tell us Sizemore can't sleep. That's fourteen minutes too many.

Never do the characters seem to see what's right in front of them or even hear their own dialog.  Alexander asks: ""Where's the dog?"" and Goodman won't ever let her find out. Poor doggy.

The dialog is shhhhhhhhh... quiet, then a gun goes off and BANG!!! your speakers blow. Note to Goodman: That ain't drama. It's annoying.

Sizemore is a sissy toy salesman who can't shoot then turns into a chef's knife throwing ninja who murders a guy on her lawn and she doesn't even notice. HUH???

They find her sister dead and then tra la la, they go for a drive. WTF?

The Big Bad Dad admits murdering her mom? Didn't he learn anything from Slick Willy or Shrub? Deny deny deny.

Alexander is a crack shot but never even touches a gun, let alone kills her dad herself. Has Goodman read his own script? Does he purposely avoid using his own characters details to develop the plot?

There was absolutely NO chemistry between those poor actors. Did they hate each other? Were they both on Haldol? Were they gay? They're in the pool together and Alexander is looking like she wants to be grabbed and Sizemore looks like he has cramps. C'mon, Bill, Alexander ain't that bad. Fake it, dude.

And why were we supposed to care about any of these sick, lost, brutal, nearly comatose people? Can Goodman give one good reason?
I mean, the woman's just as sick as the hit man is.

The lesson here for Goodman is that a bad script doesn't miraculously turn into a good film just because Sizemore swaggers around in it.

Oh yeah, that reminds me: Where's the dog?",1315872000,4,2114,4.519685039370079
4572224,5,B00555ZTHO,This was my first time watching this primarily because my favorite actress Sasha Alexander is in it. It was a very good movie...I enjoyed it very much.,1409788800,,151,4.62962962962963

4572228,4,B00555ZTHO,"Many scenes in film regarding this style of movie where the hit man falls for client, sometimes tend to be a little raggedy.  With this being said its a pretty decent movie. Its well worth the price and doesn't get caught in a tail spin trying find its way to a climax it just does.",1397865600,,282,4.127272727272727
4572229,5,B00555ZTHO,"I love anything Sasha Alexander is in, but I could only find 2 minute clips of this on the Internet and knew I just had to get it. I was not disappointed! It was really great. I loved everything about it. Even better, the DVD came a day earlier than expected.

Very satisfied with the item, seller, and delivery time.",1390867200,,317,4.283333333333333
4572230,5,B00555ZTHO,"I have become sort of addicted to this movie. I have maybe 30 or so films that I use as my ""go tos"" when I am in the mood to watch something but don't feel like searching through dozens of titles. I know them all by heart but I still enjoy watching them. This movie is now in that group.

Sizemore is great as the aging hit man who is reconsidering his life. Alexander is beautiful and does an excellent job also as a woman living in fear. The performances are a bit underplayed and I like that. The use of the town of Minden LA is fantastic and the cinematography is quite good.

The lower budget forces the director to use real locations which I find far more satisfying than elaborate sets that just don't ring true. The secondary players are all decent and you believe they sort of belong in the location. In other words they don't come off like a bunch of actors from all over just plopped into some city they don't know anything about.

The ending is satisfying but still leaves you wondering what happens to the main characters after the final scene of the movie. This is a simple, solid little film that is great to have on even if you are doing something else. Missing a part here or there won't cause you to get lost.",1389744000,2,1227,4.257510729613734

4572232,5,B00555ZTHO,"Tom Sizemore, the legendary ""wiseguy-type"" killer for hire, discovers a ""hit"" which complicates his lifestyle. As the plot develops,he questions how his relationship to his assigned ""hit"" victim fits into his character.  The ""hit"" is Sasha Alexander who has a decent movie & tv history of different roles.  The plot may seem to move slow, but the facial expressions and gestures are a highly professional portrayal of talent.

This is an extremely interesting story and extremely well performed movie.  I bought it, viewed it and continue to ponder the impact intended by the cast and director.  I'll be watching it again.  Many thoughtful nuances throughout the movie.  If you appreciate Tom Sizemore's former roles as a ""wiseguy-type"", you'll appreciate this continuation of his character...",1374710400,,793,5.346774193548387

8457523,3,B00555ZTHO,"Sizemore is asleep in this one. Anyway, I watched it because of Sasha, whose acting ability is the least of her worries: Grrrr!
The flick had ""noir"" pretensions, but except for the boyfriend, whose passion for Sasha was the most credible part of the non-plot (Who'd want to kill Ms. Alexander?), the rest of the cast phoned their roles in.  Noe.",1477612800,,345,4.655737704918033

8457530,3,B00555ZTHO,"The Last Lullaby is a ninety-three minute movie version of Max Allan Collins The Last Quarry, although in the movie version the protagonist goes by the name Price, not Quarry.  Very rarely do books translate well onto the big screen.  The adaptations often lack the depth and history that comes out in a narrative.  Other times, the movie makers change major details to show off their creativity (e.g. John Carter of Mars, Dead Calm).  This movie is fairly faithful to the book.  In most places, things that are different in the movie appear to be left out only to squeeze the book into the ninety-three minute length.

Having read all the Quarry books, including the Last Quarry, I knew the background and details going on, but am not sure that someone unfamiliar with the novels will appreciate it in the same way and it might feel disjointed to the new viewer.  Some of the humor in the novel such as the relationship between the two hoods that kidnap the first sister is missing from the movie.

The low-budget film is stark.  With the exception of a few gun battle scenes, the movie is not loud or obnoxious.  You can feel Tom Sizemore snarling in his role as the assassin and he is confused by his latest assignment: killing a small-town librarian.  Although the connection between the killer and his target is obvious in the movie, it lacked the sexiness and the sizzle and the passion found in their relationship in the book.

All in all, I enjoyed this big-screen adaptation of the Last Quarry, but my expectations for what it would be may have been too high.",1410220800,,1568,4.620938628158845
