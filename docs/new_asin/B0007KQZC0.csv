8047791,5,B0007KQZC0,I was very grateful to be able to replace this VHS since I had bought the entire Christy set from Time Life years ago. VHS's wearout after a time. Glad you had this VHS! Barb,1314748800,,174,4.0
8047792,4,B0007KQZC0,"Christy is one of my favorite tv series of all time.  It is second only to Life Goes On.  Kellie Martin shines as always.  This particular episode is especially touching to me because it centers around my favorite holiday, Thanksgiving.  In ""The Sweetest Gift"" Christy and the people of Cutter Gap rise above their trying circumstances and learn to give thanks for the blessings they do have, the most important one being each other. Christy's father becomes terribly ill, but due to her faith and determination, he gets well. This series is definitely geared more to the female crowd, but I think boys under 12 would enjoy it too.  If you haven't read the book Christy by Catherine Marshall, please do.  It will definitely add to the enjoyment of the film. All of Mrs. Marshall's books are good.  I cannot believe this show didn't last longer on tv. Hollywood must have thought it was too wholesome.",1115856000,4,900,4.730769230769231
8047793,5,B0007KQZC0,"Just about every reviewer has expressed a desire to find the whole series...well I found it!  It's on [...]
It's a little more expesive than amazon, but it has every episode, plus a boxed set of every episode (it's $100).
Hopefully this is helpful!",1079481600,17,248,4.636363636363637
8047794,5,B0007KQZC0,"I hope to collect each video in the series. Christy's compassionate and passionate attempts to educate children and families of Cutter's Gap, Appalachia, North Carolina is inspiring, uplifting and entirely entertaining. Performances by Tyne Daly, Kellie Martin and Christy's cast touch and tickle one's deepest senses. The series is far beyond the usual forgetable fare found on television. Christy should be a welcome addition to any home video library. I only hope that one day, someone will produce a DVD set of the series.",1023235200,,526,5.273809523809524
