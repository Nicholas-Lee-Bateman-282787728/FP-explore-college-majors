5961983,3,B00EZVD82M,"This movie gets mercilessly trashed online as possibly the worst zombie movie ever made. They just haven't seen many zombie movies. I've seen 90 at last count (not counting YouTube shorts) and believe me, it's not even close to the bottom. It has standard Hollywood-TV production values for one thing, something you can't take for granted in zombie films which are frequently everyone's first film ever. Others say ""It doesn't add anything to the genre"". That's true but the zombie concept is very limited and almost nothing can be added to it. The fast ""infected"" of The Crazies (1973) and 28 Days Later (2002) added the fast ""infected"" though they aren't zombies because they're not dead. They became popular because people see them as more dangerous and I've had to accept them but really, it's just being chased by an angry mob and it loses its eeriness. I've also seen zombies who take prisoners, zombies who use weapons and zombies who talk, but once you've done any of that they're not zombies anymore.

The real misstep of this film is that it has good actors who are not given anything to work with. The movie is a pretty much by-the-numbers zombie flick with ordinary suburban families caught up in a sudden zombie apocalypse. Zombies all over and you have to find shelter. The movie also isn't too long. But here you have Anthony Michael Hall, Darryl Hannah and Alan Ruck doing the usual running around and saying the usual things people say in zombie movies. I suspect SyFy wanted known names to make their movie more of an event so it would get noticed, but failed to provide them with the script they deserved. Worst of all is Academy Award winner Shirley Jones, heroine of big movie musicals and also Mrs. Partridge, who is given nothing to do but whimper, whine and scream. That's a terrible waste and an insult to the actress. Any unknown TV actor could have played these parts.

Two other missteps include graveyard zombies and a very contrived ending. I don't accept graveyard zombies. Even though Romero's original started in a cemetery, the zombies were not coming out of the graves. Locked in a heavy, often metal-lined coffin six feet under with enormous weight per square inch, zombies couldn't claw their way up and out. People all over the world put their dead away in a way that will keep them put. Maybe that's why this zombie thing is so popular; it's something very deep down that everyone subconsciously fears. Besides, they weren't even dressed like people are when they're buried. The second idea I won't give away because I don't like to spoil films for people. But you'll know what I mean when you hear it and how it neatly wraps up the ending.

But after all that it's still an entertaining movie. I loved seeing the good old lumbering Romero-type zombies, the kind that you have a chance with because you can run through a bunch of them before they can respond. The zombies look good, too. There is a general sense of terror and panic throughout that is missing in many run-of-the-mill zombie movies. Of course the people do stupid things. People always do stupid things in zombie movies. I guess they just haven't seen as many zombie flicks as we have. Director John Gulager, who directed Feast, should have done better with his million dollar budget. But as zombie films go, it's still OK and worth watching.",1475280000,2,3347,4.717948717948718

I started watching it on the SyFy channel and had to change channels after about the first 15 mins. This is a very poor  produced movie. I know that most horror type movies incorporate allot of stupidly but this movie takes the cake.

5961993,4,B00EZVD82M,"ZOMBIE NIGHT

John Gulager, The Asylum, Anthony Michael Hall, and zombies, what more could I ask for. That is what I thought when I first saw this at the store. That is also surprising since I should have heard of this before it was released since I love everything I just mentioned. Anyway when I saw it I got it immediately and went to my brothers house that night to check it out, he is a big zombie fan.

The story follows people from two families who are trying to survive the night as these zombies came out of nowhere. One is stuck on the outside making their way through town while the other is home with a panic room. The thing is neither is safe as the night goes on event after event puts them in danger, who will survive the Zombie Night.

The first thing that brought me in was the title, it had zombie in it. As far as those go I actually liked the makeup and effects here for them. Then at the top I saw Halls name, he was excellent here as were a few other people. The rest were perfect B level performances. Then I looked on the back and saw that it was made by The Asylum, I had to have it. Then I spied that it was directed by Gulager whom I love. His Feast trilogy is only behind The Evil Dead trilogy as my favorite of all time. This I will admit is by far at the bottom of the list if I put them in order.

The writers for this were Keith Allan and Delondra Williams who also wrote The Asylum zombie flick Rise of the Zombies. They were also joined by Richard Schenkman who wrote the excellent and classic Asylum flick Abraham Lincoln VS. Zombies. Now the film is far from a classic and I think the fault lies with the script. The director and actors can only do so much with what they are given. In fairness I did enjoy this flick but you can see were the influences come from.

You get a behind the scenes and trailers for special features. I wish we would have got a directors or writers commentary. Still if you are a fan of zombies or any of these people check it out. It is far from a classic but it is a fun B flick if watched with the brain off.",1431302400,,2075,4.0512195121951216

5961999,4,B00EZVD82M,"So I collect zombie movies as well as other horror movies and even though some of them are plain old terrible I need to get them to have the whole entire collection. As for this movie...I saw this one on syfy yesterday due to the fact syfy's new series ""Z Nation"" was happening. I gave this one four stars because I did think some of the zombie had good make-up on them I also enjoyed the fact that they went back to old zombie roots and had the zombies coming from the ground this is a thing I hardly see anymore these days. However, I found almost all, if not all, of the acting horrible. For example when Tracie(I believe the girls name was I do not pay much attention to the names) and her father were entering the cemetery and he stood there letting the zombie come out of the ground and did nothing! I mean try to make it as if it were really happening and I know I would not stand there like a block of wood. I think the story could have had more putting together an some more points to it. In my own thoughts I think it is really different, yet really corny, that the zombies die when the day comes. Zombies randomly appear you have no idea why and now they are dead at morning like did it happen again the next night? Too many questions left unanswered and even though some movies it is good the leave the ending open for your own mind to think what it wants with a zombie movie it does not seem right. I enjoy there was like no cursing because after a while it gets on my nervous, especially when all you hear is the bleeps from the t.v. and for the most part they kept moving instead of stopping and talking and zombies sneak up on them also there was no sex or anything(at least not that I saw on television)because that also gets on my nervous seeing it in every single movie(well not every one but a lot of them). Yeah, we all know sex and cursing is out there and for real but I would like to enjoy some horror movies without that and also drinking and teenagers the main focus point because a horror movie is about the zombie(s), vampire(s), demon(s), ghost(s), etc. and the plot of how it happened, why it is happening now and will it continue and if there is a cure or way to stop it.",1410566400,2,2202,4.147196261682243
5962000,4,B00EZVD82M,"Admittedly, the zombies perform better than the so-called actors inhabiting this piece of schlock horror madness.
Director John Gulager described his modest effort as ""a movie about families and zombies.""  I don't know quite what to make of that statement, what one has to do with the other is anyone's guess.  This is just another zombie movie among many, that it happens to boast a cast of TV has-beens and one-time movie stars is a novelty at best, a detriment in any regard.  When scenes are left to just pure zombie action, this movie isn't half bad.  It's the rest of the scenes, when poor Shirley Jones is carrying on like she's stuck in a Harold Pinter play, that seem oddly out of whack with whatever else is going on.  Did she realize she was in a zombie flick?  Not that the others did much better (especially Alan Ruck as the woefully single-minded next door neighbor).  Also, the plot is pretty limited.  The zombies appear out of thin air, no attempt to explain why they suddenly pop up and start chewing on people.  The action is confined to a small area (rule number one; don't stray in a cemetery while zombies are on the peck).  Cellars and greenhouses also prove to be poor hiding places (will people never learn).  This pretty much follows the zombie handbook except for a crazy twist that dares to suggest, like vampires, daylight will do them in, all they have to do is survive till dawn.  Huh?

I have to say, even for all of its obvious flaws and the stupid generic title, I actually formed a begrudging fondness for this stinker.  The more I watched it the more I liked it.  I'm keeping it in my collection.",1404604800,8,1632,4.522184300341297
5962001,5,B00EZVD82M,This gets 5  because the zombie make-up & movement's are better than most w/the exception of Night Of The Living Dead & The Walking Dead.  It's a little silly but over all it's worth buying for your own collection.,1402444800,,214,4.461538461538462

5962003,2,B00EZVD82M,"Extremely disappointing zombie flick that had the cult potential of the ""FEAST"" movies.  The characters were annoying, predictable and as a viewer I couldn't be more apathetic towards them.  Director John Gulager basically remade the original ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" in a contemporary setting while ripping off scenes from other movies like Carpenter's ""ASSAULT IN PRECINT 13"". ( If you decide to see it you'll see what I'm talking about!)  I really enjoyed the ""FEAST"" movies and I even found ""PIRAHNA 3DD"" disturbingly funny and entertaining but this effort by John Gulager was more a feeble attempt to make money off a genre that has been exhausted to no end.  The only reason I gave it an extra star is due to the known stars that headline this train wreck.  Hey, everybody needs a paycheck and we can all relate to that, right?  Hopefully Gulager doesn't go the Uwe Boll route and starts mass producing turd after turd!  If you must see this stinker catch it on the SYFY channel but please, do not waste money buying it or least of all renting it!",1394496000,,1055,4.6702702702702705
5962004,4,B00EZVD82M,I don't understand and don't agree with the negative reviews on this film. I thought it had good special effects and the story moved at a steady pace. I'm surprised that shirley jones and darryl hannah along were in it. But that's ok. And so was their acting. I bought the dvd/blu-ray combo of it for $8 at bestbuy. So I gave it another star for that too.,1391904000,,355,4.235294117647059
5962005,1,B00EZVD82M,"It's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD again, only not as good. The Characters and situations are far less interesting and there is no character development or plot develpment. Shirley Jones should be ashamed of herself. She was the bright young star of CAROUSEL and OKLAHOMA. Now, she's in this junk? Was her Social Security Check late this month? Darryl Hannah keeps  sinking lower and lower. What's next Darryl? Porn? Save your money. Don'y buy this. Save your time. Don't even watch this.",1390348800,,483,4.890243902439025

5962007,5,B00EZVD82M,"When I first saw this movie I thought it would be a typical zombie movie.  Wow! Was I wrong.  It kept you going and on the edge of your seat from the very start.  The theme is different too.  No toxic chemicals turning the town, no virus, etc.  It seems night time brings them back from the dead.  The zombies were made up great, The cast did an excellent job, and there were no moments when the movie dragged on like many others.  I can't say a bad word about it.  I put it up there with the original Night of the Living Dead by George Romero, and he is the master.  Highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Also, the cast is great too.  Sit back, board your windows if watching at night and prepare to see zombies at their best.",1388793600,,731,4.113475177304965
5962008,3,B00EZVD82M,"How do actors/actresses rate themselves?  Is it by paying the light bill or the challenge of acting in a movie?
We have Anthony Michael Hall (16 Candles, Dead Zone), Daryl Hannah (Splash, Blade Runner), Shirley Jones (Partridge Family), and Alan Ruck (Star Trek, Speed) in this movie.  These are seasoned actors/actresses.  The movie starts by jumping straight into a zombie outbreak, and is somewhat fast paced throughout.  I have seen better, and I have seen worse zombie movies.  The makeup effects were fine.  Our zombies are slow walkers with scoliosis and they grunt and moan.  Our survivors run from place to place, stopping long enough to get themselves in a bad spot.  As the film progressed, the thought came to my mind that this would be a perfect training film for what NOT to do in a zombie outbreak.  Some of the scenes were not well thought out.  Looters during the outbreak are running with the old, square picture tube televisions they just stole.  Really-no flat screens?  Also the zombies have either green blood or red blood with arterial spurts when they get chopped on by the survivors.  What is it with our survivors in this movie running toward the suspicious noise during a zombie outbreak?  How many gut-shots does it take to bring a zombie down?  If you enjoy the cookie-cutter zombie flick without strippers or Danny Trejo in it-you may enjoy the ride.  Maybe rent it unless you are the zombie movie collector.

5962011,1,B00EZVD82M,"This movie had to have been written in 15 minutes. It's so completely horrible from the first minute, it's hard to even make it to the end. How they got relatively big names to star in this...I will never understand. It could have been a rather effective zombie movie if they had kept it simple. Instead, it's an over the top cgi gorefest of ridiculous. Shirley Jones is particularly annoying, as well, doing nothing but wandering around whining. Asylum continues to put quality last on their list of priorities. How they continue to get funding to make this kind of garbage is a real mystery to me. Avoid this at all costs.",1382918400,14,624,4.580357142857143
8610963,4,B00EZVD82M,"I got this on ebay. I think it was made for the SYFY channel. It never explains why the zombies came back to life and is about as simple as a horror flick as they come. It's just simply for those who want to turn off their brain and watch nothing but carnage. It isn't well made or anything like that. It revolves around some people trying to survive this night with the dead walking around. Sometimes they're outside and other times they're inside. There's no scenery worth mentioning or any effective atmosphere. The acting varies, and I don't think many will like the directing. It just relies on violence and gore. It says it's the unrated version, but there's no nudity. I also don't know if there's any added gore compared to the version that aired on the SYFY channel. The SYFY channel is lenient with showing the blood and guts with these types of films, so don't think it isn't gory simply because it was made for that TV channel. I thought the entire movie has a very made for TV type style and feel. I was looking for something that was extremely simple with just violence and gore when I bought it, so I was happy.

I managed to pick this up new on DVD for 1 so its a huge bargain overall, the movie is actually quite decent considering its a TV movie and its an Asylum produced movie, the story is thin but reasonably well paced and kept simple, just two families split up that are trying to get back together during an unexplained zombie outbreak, the cast is ok and the acting is decent I guess for a zombie movie, Daryl Hannah from Kill bill is probably the most recognisable star in the movie, the music is ok, the special effects are actually not too bad with plenty of bloody moments here and there, still could of had a 15 certification though. if your a zombie movie fan its worth a watch at least especially as you can pick it up so cheap.
