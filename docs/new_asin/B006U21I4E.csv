8504369,5,B006U21I4E,Really well-done storyline and take on how the Asgardian gods reach out to protect the denizens of Midgard (Earth) through a mortal champion. Big-budget effects and CGI are the only advantages the Marvel rendition of Thor have over this production.,1517097600,,248,5.225

8504372,1,B006U21I4E,"The one star is because you can't choose no stars. This is a ghastly movie that looks like a (poor) high school student project. Everything about it is cheap, most indoor scenes are shot against harshly lit, bare walls. The camera rarely changes angle during a scene, the acting is quite poor, the dialog is often drowned out by the background music. There's very little action; much of the film is expository. The costumes look like they came from WalMart's Halloween section. I could go on... this movie doesn't even qualify for the ""so bad it's good"" category. Rather than spend $20 on this, I would recommend you burn a $20 bill. That would have more entertainment value than the film, and it'll waste less of your time. This movie gives Canadian filmmaking a bad name... oh, wait a minute...",1347321600,7,796,4.692857142857143
