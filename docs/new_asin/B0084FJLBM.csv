Amy has produced another winner. Hip Hop Walk is a fun workout that anyone can do, no matter what their fitness level.

Why I love this workout:

**Amy's masterful breakdown of the moves. Even I could `get' the moves.  Well, maybe I didn't quite look like Amy doing the moves, but I was moving and having fun, so that is what counts.

**The music really fits the workout. I must admit, I normally am not a big fan of hip hop music, but in this case, the driving beat really worked.

**It's totally low impact so it's perfect for me right now since I'm dealing with a torn hip cartilage. When my hip heals, this will be the perfect workout to do on those days when I want to move, but I don't want something super-intense. I've learned the hard way that I can't do high-intensity exercise every day, nor should anyone else do this. This will also be perfect cardio for when I'm doing a heavy weight training rotation.

**The intensity sections that come about 30 minutes into the workout. By exaggerating the movements, you can really get your heart rate up, with NO impact.

There a few things to note about this workout. I personally don't consider them negatives, since I love this workout.

The things to note:

**It's just Amy doing the routine. I miss the energy of having a few other cast members. I especially noticed this during the first half of the workout. The more I do this workout, the less I notice this because I am having so much fun.

**There is one tricky move that I'm still trying to get. It's called the throw down (and kick). Amy doesn't break it down, but that's okay with me since this gives me something to work on.

**Amy is timing the 30 second power surges and she is doing so by looking at her watch. The first few times I did this workout, I found this very distracting and thought it broke up the flow of the workout. I would think she could have had a big timer off-set for keeping track, or have someone off-set doing the timing. At one point during an interval she even mentions that there's lots of timers. Now during the intervals, I don't look at the tv screen so I don't get distracted.

**The set is interesting, to say the least. In the back there's frosted glass windows, with trees showing. There's also a step, along with a few stability balls. Off to the side, there are some ballet bars, with yoga mats strung over them. Since this is a walking workout, I don't understand the significance of the step, balls, barres and yoga mat. Although, I didn't' mind the set since I was enjoying the workout so much.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone of any level, who wants a fun and different low-impact cardio workout.",1338508800,2,2927,4.366482504604051

8525087,3,B0084FJLBM,"I got this dvd for my lighter cardio days, or when I just want extra movement in the winter.  This was not as entertaining as I thought.  It did not hold my attention.",1393718400,,167,4.03030303030303
8525088,3,B0084FJLBM,"I thought that this would be a better workout with more high energy, cardio type routines.  Not a bad workout, just wanted more for myself.",1391904000,,139,4.56
8525089,3,B0084FJLBM,Can get your heart rate up to target range.  I plan to try some of her other workout low impact workout DVD's.,1386892800,,110,4.0
8525090,5,B0084FJLBM,"I have a lot of Amy's DVDs.  When I saw she combined my two favorite exercises into one, I just had to have it.  What fun!  and the steps are very easy to learn, even if you don't like hip hop.  Great job, Amy.  You've done it right again!",1369440000,2,239,3.795918367346939
8525091,2,B0084FJLBM,"I was looking for something fun, simple, and with a hip hop beat. The description for this DVD had all these things. I'll give it the fun, if you've been exercising on a regular basis and can keep up. This DVD is far from simple, and I would totally disagree with the non-impact claim it makes. The hip hop music is rather boring, not my brand of hip hop. If you're a beginner, don't waste your money.",1365984000,,401,4.220779220779221
8525092,5,B0084FJLBM,"I really enjoyed this one. I have been a big fan of Leslie Sansone for years, but her similar routines get stale, so I got this to add some spice, and it does the trick. The moves are simple enough yet have variety, and the second half of the workout has intervals of a bit more intensity, tho still low impact, with lower intensity. It is a good beginner/intermediate level workout for either those starting out, those needing low impact, or those wanting an easier workout for lighter days. Amy is a good instructor, the cueing is good, music is decent.",1365379200,3,555,4.5049504950495045
8525093,4,B0084FJLBM,This works for me.  I encourage you to find something that helps you. Maybe this is it.  Feeling better and your body becoming  'in shape'  is great.,1347580800,,149,4.407407407407407
