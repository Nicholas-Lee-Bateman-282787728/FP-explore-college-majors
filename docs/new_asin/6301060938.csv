You and I could have made a better movie.",1273017600,,85,4.0588235294117645
314738,3,6301060938,"The number of reviews with more than three stars swayed me into ordering this video. That and the price seemed reasonable.
The price paid is now written off as tuition cost, for the price of learning that several good reviews doesn't make something worth buying.",1263686400,,262,4.844444444444444
314739,4,6301060938,"Saw first years ago on VHS, DVD actually had more than I remembered on it, the transfer retained the picture and sound quality entirely. I think it could have merited more than B-movie status without much more effort, but then we probably would have had someone other than Kathy Shower not showing as much of what made her famous. Also might have lead to other ""Further Adventures"". As is, it is a favorite in my B-movie collection.",1255651200,4,432,4.623376623376624
314740,2,6301060938,"I watched this movie as a teenager in the 80's and for some reason it stuck in my mind.  I had two reasons to watch it again, Kathy Shower and the seaplane.  Having re-watched it, those are the two worthwhile reasons to see it now.  Very low-budget, which I don't mind, but also very poor acting and poor plot.",1246752000,,310,4.220338983050848
314741,5,6301060938,"Not a bad B movie. Nice locations and the gorgeous Kathy shower (PMOY'86)/David Keith make for good viewing pleasure even if the storyline sucks, and the acting is a little off at times. It's meant to be an adventure comedy, but Kathy's rape scene although not graphic is a little off-putting to the rest of the storyline. Highlights include, but not limited to Miss Shower's 'All girl tribal rubdown oil massage' - the likes of which can be seen in any self-respecting jungle-babe movie (Tazan with Bo Derek a prime example), and several extended shots of Kathy in differing forms of near and total undress. Please Note: Kathy looks incredible just out of playboy, and acts her way through the movie with assured confidence and dare I say, a modicum of snarling wit.
All and all, an inoffensive movie but lacking a 'point' moreso than plot. The movie as a whole, or scenes within it could have been exploited so much more, but none the less it's enjoyable on several levels, even if you're only watching it in the basement...alone...like i did!
One of Kathy's better fan movies for sure.",1234396800,4,1088,4.731578947368421
314742,4,6301060938,"I saw this film back in the 1980's.  It's about a guy who has grown up in and lives in a jungle.  He meets a husband and wife who are looking for guide into a more dangerous area where cannibals reside.  You some bare breasts and there are some sexual situations including a rape scene in the film.  The ""R"" rating is well deserved.  I am also a fan of David Keith who has acted in various TV programs and films over the years.  Mr. Keith (not to be confused with the actor Keith David who is also very good and has a very long acting resume himself) directs this film as well as being the star.  The acting is good and action keeps the movie going at a nice pace.  If you like adventure via foreign travel, this flick is one to check out.  Happy movie watching!",1203465600,3,762,4.094594594594595
314743,5,6301060938,Davey is the greatest actor ever. Humphrey Bogart? John Wayne? Tom Cruise? Role stealing Leo?? Davey is the greatest actor of our generation. Those other guys are chumps. My buddy slash thinks he is the best too.,1073433600,2,212,4.756756756756757

7809933,5,6301060938,I've been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD. I've even seen it for over $100 on VHS and now it's finally here! Well worth the money.,1374537600,,144,3.8333333333333335
7809934,3,6301060938,"Well, let me see.  I first saw this flick when it first came out, and thought Kathy Showers was super hot in it.  So when I saw it offered on DVD I had to have it.  After purchasing it, and watching it again I still think she is very sexy and attractive, but not as much as I remember.  The DVD scenes with Miss Showers oil massage seem considerably shorter than I remember, as do some of the other scenes.  This could be due to my memory, but if I had rented and was seeing it for the first time, I don't think I would want to purchase it.  It was OK, but that's about as high as I could rate it.",1363478400,,597,3.8524590163934427
7809935,3,6301060938,"I first saw this film in the '80s and I thought it was great. It has only recently been made available on dvd so I rushed to get it. I turns out that my memory of this film is better than the actual film. Although I do like David Keith, it is by far, not his greatest work.",1357171200,,273,3.7241379310344827
7809936,5,6301060938,"Tennessee Buck is a fun movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. It's a cheap knockoff of Indiana Jones, and the creators seem to understand this.

They wanted to make an Indiana Jones movie but didn't have the big bucks for great special effects. So elaborate special effects are substituted with the usual B-movie conventions that are pulled off extremely well.

There's blood and gore.

There's a decapitation.

There's a Ken-Doll, frat- boy type who is hilariously bungling and inept.

There's a naked, big- breasted native girl  who dances and jiggles before a captive audience who enjoys the show.

There's a blonde bimbo who gets forcibly stripped, oiled up, and raped.

You get the picture.

If you're a fan of b-movie gutter trash, check it out!",1343347200,3,778,4.833333333333333
7809937,5,6301060938,I remember seeing this movie a long time ago I think I even taped it but lost it when i started converting over to dvd. I think the other reviews of this movie speak for its self. Any idea of when this movie is coming out on dvd,1341014400,,228,3.7708333333333335
7809938,5,6301060938,This version is a copy of the laser disk version converted onto DVD. The official version hasn't been released yet. It's long overdue and the film deserves a proper release. Hopefully this movie will be officially released on DVD or Blu Ray one day and will contain deleted scenes of this film including the longer oil rub (more than one version of Miss Shower's forced rubdown was filmed) plus the native women removing Kathy's clothes prior to the forced native oil massage.,1323216000,4,476,4.817073170731708
