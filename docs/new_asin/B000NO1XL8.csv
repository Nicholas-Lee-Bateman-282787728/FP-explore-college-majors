SYNOPSIS--
Sgt. Lucas is a falsely-accused prisoner being escorted to the titled fort by Capt. Howard and his patrol. Along the way they're ambushed by Indians and the captain is badly injured. Lucas takes over command of the column. When they reach their destination it's discovered that the entire garrison was killed in battle, all except an elderly major who wants to retire from the cavalry. Capt. Howard dies of his wounds and the major leaves the fort under a white flag. He's quickly butchered. Again, Lucas assumes command, leading the small contingent of troops against overwhelming odds and one attack after another.

Also from the same year and with a similar cast is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CONVICT-STAGE/dp/B000NO1XKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CONVICT STAGE</a>, which was undoubtedly the other half of that double-feature!

8179518,2,B000NO1XL8,"I wanted to see a good old-fashioned western with Calvary v. Indians, but I apparently didn't have a high enough standard for the adjective good. This movie is about as low budget as they come. The battle scenes were almost comical. A member of the beleaguered army fort would observe with great fear, ""The Indians are forming to attack!"" Cut camera to the Indian charge and you witness a whole hoard of all of 12 to 15 Indians. Heck, half the time the Calvary outnumbered the Indians AND they were armed with repeating riffles sitting behind stockade walls. What were the Indians going to do, huff and puff and blow the fort down? Just when you think you had seen it all, the movie ends with the Indians simply letting the soldiers go because, ""They have fought the good fight and shown bravery.""  Perhaps I should have sought a very good fairy tale. This movie certainly would have filled that need very nicely.",1204243200,4,913,4.601226993865031
