She  worked for a newspaper in her early days and for a publishing house in her  later days and raised two kids in between that. Her fashion sense was  amazing and her gift for gab was very useful. If you agree with these facts  then you will enjoy the lastest documntary about Jackie Kennedy Onassis.  When I bought yet another documtary about Jackie Kennedy I thought it would  be the same old information. But this one was a bit differnt. Not in the  sense that it told new information, but in the sense that it made Jackie  seem a bit more like a real person. She had her faults like anyone and this  documentary shows a few of her flaws. She was stunning woman and very  graceful. But she was human. She made mistakes like anyone else. I liked  the fact that the documentary points out she wasn't perfect. Jackie was an  amazing woman with the strenght and wisdom of someone twice her age. She  was a good mother, and a loving wife. But Jackie was more or less famous  for being famous and finally someone at least one documentary has hinted to  that fact. For that reason alone I recommend it.",962755200,25,1246,4.3755458515283845
