8282389,5,B001B9I3QW,"Well done DVD and I Love the book of the same name. Lovely to have both so you can see the master in action. Best way to learn from a person like this because if you miss something, you can play-read it again till you have sucked it all in.",1442793600,2,240,3.82
8282390,5,B001B9I3QW,"Much is offered in this DVD.  Probably not for the first time water color painter.  If you've gotten past the first efforts, and want to continue with improving results, this DVD can be an enormous aid.  Robert is very thorough in explaining what he's doing as he paints each demo.  His emphasis in values is an excellent start and he stresses this as the teaching progresses.  I recommend this to anyone who is serious about producing work well above the beginning level.",1398470400,6,472,4.7073170731707314
8282391,5,B001B9I3QW,I bought this DVD to add to my collection. I find having several instruction videos on a subject broadens my approach and strengthens my courage to keep working in ways I otherwise would not be aware of. Robert Wade is and impressionist of the best order in my opinion. I love the way he promotes painting as an individual expression of the artist's feeling for the subject. He makes no apologies about changing things around to fit how the artist sees the subject. Good stuff here if you want to look at watercolors from a unique perspective.,1387152000,8,543,4.608247422680412
