8107294,3,B000E8N9A6,"Stilted, surreal, early '30s drama, set in a diamond-mining area of the Brazilian jungle. Four North American women, victims of the depression, arrive on the scene: three as ""mail order brides"", one more ""innocent"", not understanding that she has accepted employment with a very suspicious character, Alan Hale, Sr.
Dorothy MacKaill is the tough one of the group, but softens when she feels for Dorothy Libaire - she switches ""Pictures"" so Dorothy can marry Regis Toomey, a strong character, who works for the corrupt and violent Hale, with a view towards staking his claim which he can use for social redemption (seems he, too, has ""a past"").
An interesting setting and sharp dialogue make this often nightmarish mixture interesting.
It's conceivable that Mae Busch had a larger part which was cut down. She's one of the seekers, arrives along with the others; plays a woman forced to live by her wits, employing some upper crust mannerisms which are not convincing. By about mid-picture, she's out of the picture.
I was surprised to note that the film was released in 1934. Has a much earlier ""soundie"" quality.
Important note: Typical of the period ethnic references repeated.",1216598400,7,1179,5.051282051282051
