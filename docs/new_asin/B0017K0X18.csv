8266246,1,B0017K0X18,"Expected to see Pope Benedict XVI at White House with President Bush both speaking from the second story porch giving adresses followed by the U.S.Army Band and Choir singing ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"", which was a most amazing moving event, maybe the most outstanding in American Catholic history.  Instead Chris Wallace put on his usual show about himself telling us about problems with liberals and molesters, maybe the most disgraceful in American Catholic history. A fraud on thepurchaser, but no refund.",1316217600,,512,5.2439024390243905
8266247,1,B0017K0X18,"I ordered this DVD twice and both times I was sent a defective DVD.  It was not formatted correctly...apparently a manufacturing error.  It could not be played in either my computer or television's dvd player.  What came on screen was just a bunch of data.  How Amazon wasn't aware of this problem is beyond me.  I called and let them know right away after receiving my first defective dvd, never dreaming the next would also be be unusable.  It caused trouble at work for me as we needed that DVD for research purposes on a project we were working on and had a deadline for.",1212624000,,575,4.428571428571429
8266248,5,B0017K0X18,"A must see for all to see, whether Christians or non-Christians.  Motivating to make a huge change in our troubled world today, and far more hopeful than any of our American Presidential Candidates can offer.  You just have to see it.  I encourage every American to watch and join the journey of Pope Benedict IV through the media at Fox News Channel or unless you fortunate enough, travel with him across America.",1208044800,3,414,4.722222222222222
8266249,3,B0017K0X18,What's wrong with Fox News??  Why does the female reporter interviewing the Catholic priest need to show the world her cleavage?  Can't she control herself?,1208044800,5,156,5.2
8266250,5,B0017K0X18,"The visit of Pope Benedict to America will bolster the faith of Christians of all kinds, but most especially the Catholic Christians because he is the Vicar of Christ Jesus who founded the Church.  All religions have truth, and Pope Benedict will acknowledge this.  But most importantly the Pope will point the way to the fullness of all Truth subsisting in the Catholic Church. He invite all people to ""come and see.""  I think this is awesome. Only the Catholic Church can do this. And despite, or maybe because of the  weaknesses found in some the members of the Church, the Pope can speak of Hope and Faith in the God of all mankind as being the answer to these weaknesses. He brings the seeds for answers to the needs of all times and places and peoples.",1208044800,5,758,4.510948905109489
