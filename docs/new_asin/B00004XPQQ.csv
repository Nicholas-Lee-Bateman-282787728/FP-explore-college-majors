1367865,1,B00004XPQQ,"I have four words for you: Can I return this?!
This is, by far, the worst Olsen movie ever. I would go as far as to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen with the exception of Gepetto. I like the twins, I really do-but this is just plain awful.
It starts out kinda cute but quickly goes corny.  Every five minutes they are moving to a new town with new identities and with a slew of new puns.  I'm not sure how many other kids have watched ""The Sopranos"", but the references made to it were over my head.  Also, I don't like how they would freeze frame and mention things like chase sequences, spit takes (only funny to fans of Passport to Paris), casting, and finales.  Who cares?  That's what makes a movie a movie.  I don't need them to spell it out for me.  Also, where did they find those actors?  Hollywood Uglies?  The girls are pretty enough without having to be played up by a terrible cast.  Viewers will spend more time stifling giggles at the cancer-stick mom and Aussi girls than wathing the twins.
I'm almost starting to feel sorry for these girls. That lawyer of theirs, Thorne, uses them as his meal ticket.  This movie makes it evident that it is the name, not the quality, that sells. (Yeah, the gameboy games are bad too.) That man only sees numbers (his personal salary, that is) and that obviously prohibits him from hiring decent writers, known actors, and affording better cinemotography than microsoft power point. I think that my school dance had a bigger budget than this movie.  Thorne leers these girls into stupid projects with the promises that they get to travel and shoot a few fun scenes like the Austin Powers one on the yacht, and get some new clothes.
If I were their parents I would seriously look at transferring my daughters empire into the power of somebody that care more about people than money.  Not only are the girls being used, but there are millions of kids throwing away their money on this garbage.  That's not the kind of role model they want to be, is it?",975196800,30,2018,4.418918918918919
1367866,4,B00004XPQQ,"Well whaddaya know.
Another Olsen twin movie that's like....well...an Olsen twin movie. But nevertheless, it's still fun.
The main story involves the twins facing the new high school like any other teenagers, but a series of events leads to trouble, and before they know it, the girls who're supposed to face high school instead face the Witness Protection Program after facing a criminal. So off they go to Australia...where they, you guessed it, have lots of fun along the way. There's not much to say about the story, seriously. The main focus seems to be fun, fun, and, you guessed it, fun.
The story line is kind of second rate, and the script leaves much to the imagination, but any negative points are countered by the wonderful acting of the spiritful twins. Mind you, they're not the greatest actors, but they're excellent for their age. With lots of boys and cute teen clothes, this will definitely become a hit among the pre-teen and early teen crowd. But whatever else, it's loads of fun for the whole family. Yes, that's right. Even the parents and older teens can watch it, since it IS funny in parts. Some jokes are lame, but the rest of it will have you laughing. A recommended movie for those who like mindless fun.",974678400,38,1232,4.682027649769585

1367907,5,B00004XPQQ,Even though I don't think review should be about the movie I'll start by saying it's a really good classic MK & A movie.  What I was even more impressed with was that the dvd was really good quality.  I was apprehensive because I thought it might skip or be filmed in the back of a movie theater but it's not.

Preteens are their audience I think.  It was a movie I could put on in the back ground, pay little attention to and not get lost in plot twists.  I do like how everyone turns out to be essentially good in the end.",1379289600,,356,4.253731343283582

The plot was ridiculous and the ad libing by the characters even more so.  I can't believe I sat through the entire movie.  I kept thinking it has to get better, it can't get any more stupid and every time I was proven wrong.  Unless you're really into dumb comedy this movie is a complete waste of time.",1358467200,,480,4.163043478260869
1368024,3,B00004XPQQ,"Last night, I rented ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" just for kicks.

Watching it, it's...okay...

Cute for kids under 12 years old.

But on the other hand, it was very unrealistic and silly. Most of the adults acted sillier than the kids.

Movies like that belong straight to video. That's why their other movie, ""New York Minute,"" wasn't successful, in the box office.

However, that's just my opinion. I guess I'm more of a serious person.",1324425600,,432,4.706666666666667

1368046,5,B00004XPQQ,this is a pretty good movie. The olsen twins did it again in this fun film about two girls who witness a crime and hve to be in the witness protection program. but the big thing is that they can't keep thier mouths shut.

1368069,5,B00004XPQQ,"This is kinda a different approach for the wonderful Olsen TwinS Mary-Kate and Ashley..What i mean is this is totally silly humor that is like that of Mel Brooks or Monty Python or even say that of a Lesilie Nealson (of Naked Gun/Airplane) movies..Only difference is picture that humor put into family entertainment form..To me this is their 2nd best movie (the first best being It TakeS TwO:) This movie is just one of those comedy movies that is soooo silly that you find yourselves laughing so hard it may take a 2 or 3 times to catch everything..Brillant comedy in every sense of the word..I could list some here but that will take away a lot for people viewing this movie for the first time. I will say one they are on search for a stolen jewel known as the ""Neil Diamond"" *nuFF Said LoL*.And on this quest they are chased by the most stupid and clutsy crooks since the robbers of home alone. In fact you get some of that Home alone kinda thing here as well..
This is definatly the best of the ""traveling"" movies of the Olsen TwinS..Sit back relax and get ready to have loads of fun as you goooooooo downnnnnn under with the Olsen TwinS Mary-Kate and Ashely Olsen......",1074729600,,1174,4.465116279069767
1368070,2,B00004XPQQ,I normally love all the Olsons movies as they are always adventurous and creative. I thought this one would be the best as it was filmed and acted where i live which is Sydney. But to tell you the truth this was the worst one ive seen yet as its confusing in i thinking its not making to much scence. I was very disapointed about this as it was there first in Australia. If this review is helping anyone at all don't let it put you down try it and if you like it there is a MUST for the rest of there movies.,1050710400,,508,3.894230769230769
1368071,4,B00004XPQQ,"""Our Lips Are Sealed"" is my favorite Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen film.
The twins witness a crime involving a stolen jewel and are in the Witness Protection Program. They change their identities about 4 million times before being sent on the last place of earth: Australia! The fact that they filmed on location gave you a nice scenery of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Of course, they meet two surfer rebel guys and a snobby girl, Victoria. There is slight, yet tasteful, bathroom humor and they actually have TWO parents.
Two goons working for the head of an Eastern European Mobster find them in Sydney and attempt to find the diamond, the twins prove that they're smarter and catch the REAL bad guy (goon from an imaginary country called Urugli) and save the day! Predictable, bubbly and a great family film; the essential mixture for a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie.",1035504000,,882,4.771241830065359

1368096,1,B00004XPQQ,The movie was good but some parts were unrealistic. Like even if Mary-kate and Ashley did stop theives from stealing a jewel they would try hard to keep it a secret.

1368101,5,B00004XPQQ,I already owned the vhs version but I just had to have the dvd too! It was well worth it. It has tons of extra footage including behind the scenes stuff like the bridge walk. I also really enjoyed the commentary. In that option they talk to you through out the movie and tell you what was happening or why it happened. It's awesome! You should for sure buy it.

It wasn't easy but I had some help from my friend Big Foot Barley.  I don't think they can ever do a better movie then ""Camp out Party"" Hopefully one day they will start looking more like humans too.

1368124,5,B00004XPQQ,"This movie stars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. It starts out when a crime is commited. The twins were there, so they had to go to court to report what they saw. Well, Emil Hatchew, the burgaler's uncle says he will get the girls. They have to go into the Witness Protection Program. The Olsen's are sent all over the Unites States, and they just can't stop blabbing why they are there. Finally, they are sent to the last place, Austraila. You will never guess what happens then. So I guess you have to watch the movie to find out.
I recommend this movie to kids age 3-15. Anyone will like it!!!!",982281600,,593,4.351351351351352
1368125,5,B00004XPQQ,"There are many many mistakes in the story line. But if you don't look at those - you'll see a very funny movie. Two girls witness the theft of the Kneel Diamond and they need to hide from the crooks who stole it. They end up hiding in Sydney, Australia. That's the whole story. Doesn't sound that challenging, and actually - the story isn't very challenging at it self, although it is very welcome change on the regular Mary-Kate and Ashley movies. The biggest plus side of this movie however, is the humor, which is can be compared to an average Leslie Nielsen movie, but it's just still lacking some of the extremes of Nielsen.  It's also nice to see the movie making fun of other movies such as Titanic, Home alone and even another Olsen-movie: Passport to Paris.",979084800,,766,4.510791366906475
1368126,4,B00004XPQQ,This video was very different than the other videos. I did not like the way they had the talking to the camera parts. They should have made it just a regular movie. But I love the Olsen twins. I am they're #1 fan,978825600,,212,3.953488372093023

They eye witness a crime and have to go under cover in the FBI because a criminal is chasing them. They just cant keep their lips sealed on the secret and have to keep moving until they come to the last place on the globe,Australia. Fitting in with the Aussies isn't easy. Finally they meet the cutest boys they ever dreamed of and find their place. But they must keep their eyes peeled and their lips sealed because the criminal is moving closer and closer to finding them.  Funny,suspensful, and cute, this movie has great acting,adventure,jokes, and special effects that you and your family will love!",978480000,4,708,4.709677419354839
1368128,5,B00004XPQQ,"I liked this movie. I'm 13 and I just love Mary-Kate and Ashley movies. In this particular movie, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen start out in high school. After witnessing a theft, they become the prey of the thief's uncle. They then become part of the FBI's Witness Protection Program, which means they get a new home and a completely new identity. They move to beautiful Sydney, Australia and struggle to fit in (as if they wouldn't!) at high school. They meet some REALLY HOT guys and, as usual, fall in love with them. This movie would be for girls (ages 6-16), I would say. Boys might stay awake through this movie, but they wouldn't enjoy it. These girls are really growing up right before our very eyes, and I don't think this movie is as dumb as their earlier ones were. The plot is great, they're becoming great actresses, and it's all-around cute, so I really liked this movie.",978307200,18,883,4.559748427672956
1368129,5,B00004XPQQ,"I am a teenager(14) and i definetely liked this movie a lot! I think that Mary-Kate and Ashley get there chance to shine.  The two twins are starting their first day of high school but it does not turn out how they expected.  After a long day at school they end up witnessing a crime and for their safety are put in the witness protection program where they find many difficulties!  They can't keep their mouths shut!  After many moves, many houses, and many new friends they are finally sent to Austrailia in hopes their cover will not be blown there.  One of the family members of the criminal is after them and they find more difficulties but handle it very well.  I would recommend this movie for girl teenagers...this is definetely not a guy movie.  As for parents...moms-you may enjoy watching it with your daughter...there are some comedic parts...dads- i don't think you would enjoy this movie very much unless you just want to be with your daughter!",978048000,6,958,4.633136094674557
1368140,3,B00004XPQQ,I'm used to seeing the olsen twins in movies with only 1 parent and trying to fix them up or they go to a far away place like Paris. But Our Lips Are Sealed has a pretty good and original storyline. It's about 2 sisters who witness a crime and is sent to different places with new identities. The last place they reach is Australia. Along the way they deal with popularity and boys and there are a few surprises! A real good movie for Mary Kate and Ashley fans or any younger teen!,977702400,3,481,4.127659574468085
1368141,3,B00004XPQQ,"I waited a really long time to see this, ever since the day it came out.
I sort of waited for nothing.
For starters, I was glad to see that the plot went somewhere.  (Unlike Switching Goals, which ended when it started.)  And the girls had great hair, great clothes, and the guys were HOT!
But it was hard to tell the difference between reality and dreams in the beginning.  Also, what sort of stupid criminal would steal a rare diamond in the middle of the day?  And super-charged ketchup?  Puh-leeze.  Another problem with the Olsen movies is that they are pretty far from reality.  I mean, I know it's nice to imagine amazing things happening to you, but they go a little too far.
It's pretty good, and I recommend it for any Olsen fan.
P.S. I was a little disappointed they didn't kiss in the end, too.",976924800,,806,4.369127516778524

These two hobbits were merely annoying when they were on T.V. but they are downright toxic in this dreck. How about subjecting your kids to a real film like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or even ""Kiki's Delivery Service""?

Plus all the Australia stuff is hilarious.  And most of all, the girls look great.  (Don't just take it from me -- my brother thinks so, too!)
If you like great locations, and fun adventure, this movie is rocking.
