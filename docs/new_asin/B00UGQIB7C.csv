8706558,4,B00UGQIB7C,"I don't understand why people have given this such a horrible review. I read the book a long time ago. This is one of the times when a movie turns out to be better than the book. Kevin Costner puts in a great performance. The scenery is breath-taking. The story line is entirely believable. Essentially, there has been a war in the United States that has devastated the country. Given the events that are currently occurring in this country, this doesn't sound too far fetched. The government has broken down and Americans have turned to a more tribal culture. Most of them just want to be left alone. But a militia group has taken control of the area where the story takes place. Enter Kevin Costner. He finds an abandoned postal truck with the dead postman inside. He assumes the identity of 'the postman' and accidentally becomes the beacon of hope for the people.",1513555200,2,867,4.636363636363637
