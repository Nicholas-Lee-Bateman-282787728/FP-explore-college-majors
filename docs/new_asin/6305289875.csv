The picture on the DVD cover made me think it had new footage, but I think the newest video was the Challenger vigeo. They spent like 10 minutes showing a sattelite being released. It just spun around and around and around........The only thing is good for is to throw in the air and shoot, like an old record. At least it'll be put out of it's misery...and the misery it causes other people.",1083110400,,556,4.355769230769231
7886832,1,6305289875,"This thing must have been put together by the third-grade son of a NASA janitor. What a disorganized mish-mash, and an awful soundtrack to boot.  Particularly abominable was the Dracula organ music playing as the ill-fated Challenger crew donned their helmets. Also ridiculous were the interactive extras with the juvenile spinning planets and the article on ""Living in Space,"" where only food issues are addressed, the first paragraph not even mentioning that FOOD was the topic. ""Need to be more convenient and tasty...."" What, the astronauts? We borrowed this DVD from the library and sorely regretted it. We would never pay money for this garbage.",1061337600,3,651,5.2
7886833,1,6305289875,"This is without a doubt the worst DVD I've ever seen. There is no meaningful dialog. The music is of a very poor selection. The DVD's effects used in the menus and intermissions are extremely poor quality. Basically this movie is a scattered collection of NASA photos and film, with totally unrelated music playing in the FOREGROUND. That's it. There is no information given. Don't bother wasting your money on this space DVD. You'll have a hard time giving it away once you own it. I doubt you'll be able to stomach it for more than 15 minutes.
If you want a really good space experience check out ""The BBC Presents THE PLANETS"" which is quite good. Also ""TO THE MOON"" by NOVA is a 5 start production that is EXCELLENT! And for some breath taking space scenes check out ""Destiny In Space"" by IMAX. These are all excellent choices. Just spending 10 minutes of your day watching a clip of any of these films is far more rewarding than watching the entire ""The Ultimate Space Experience"" DVD. So don't think you are saving money purchasing this DVD. Think about it. 10 minutes of these other DVDs is better than this entire DVD. If you add up the minutes of enjoyment you'll get watching this DVD it amounts to ZERO. Is even a dollar worth ZERO minutes of enjoyment?",1022371200,,1264,4.524017467248909
7886834,1,6305289875,"This movie is SO bad, that you might consider buying it just for a good laugh. It's only $.... So, if you have a good sense of humor, and are able to laugh at stupid things, this is the DVD for you. Otherwise, I am sure that if you buy this DVD you won't even be able to watch the whole thing through even once.
This DVD gets a whopping ZERO STARS! WHY OH WHY does Amazon not allow a zero star rating?",989280000,,401,3.8433734939759034
7886835,1,6305289875,"Don't pay more than $5 for this DVD.  Even then, you will get EXACTLY what you pay for it.  Would be good for children under age 10 (maybe), but is difficult to navigate, no narration or subtitles to help viewer understand  what they are seeing.  My advice: pass on this one.  I didn't, and I wish I  had my $5 back.",917568000,,316,4.098360655737705
