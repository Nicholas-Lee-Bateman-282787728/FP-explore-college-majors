AS SHIIRO AND SABER FIGHT THEIR FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER, THEY RUN INTO GILGAMESH, THE ARCHER SERVANT FROM THE LAST GRAIL WAR.  GILGAMESH TRIES TO KILL SHIIRO TO FORCE SABER TO COME TO HIS SIDE, BUT SHIIRO HAS ONE TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE WHICH FORCES THE CRAZED ARCHER TO FLEE.  THEN THE IDENTITY OF RIDER'S MASTER IS DISCOVERED, AND AND SHIIRO IS CAPTURED.  SABER RUSHES TO HER MASTER'S AID, AND ON THE RETURN TRIP IT IS RIDER WHO TRIES TO STOP GILGAMESH FROM KILLING THEM.  I AM NOT GOING TO SPOIL THE LAST TWO EPISODES SO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THEM SO THEY CAN ENJOY THEM.....

THE SERIES STARTED OFF WITH A BANG, AND ENDED ON A HIGH NOTE.  WITH MANY ANSWERS GIVEN AND SEVERAL QUESTIONS STILL LEFT TO THE VIEWERS IMAGINATION. A SERIES AS GOOD AS THIS ONE MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE, IF THINGS DID NOT END THE WAY THEY DID.  BUT THAT IS THE GREAT PART OF BEING AN ANIME LOVER, YOU CAN ALWAYS FILL IN YOUR OWN BLANKS.......THANK YOU AND GOOD VIEWING",1194307200,,1087,4.4

Most of the time I wouldn't pick up an anime just by the look of the cover, but this one looked appealing to me so I decided, hey what the heck! I'm glad I did pick this one up, it's definitely a keeper. I'm not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen the ending yet, but it definitely caught me a bit off guard. Great ending in my opinion. The animation quality and voice acting(Japanese and English) is superb. Great story line that will definitely grab your attention. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes some action and drama. 5 stars.",1193875200,3,671,4.419354838709677
