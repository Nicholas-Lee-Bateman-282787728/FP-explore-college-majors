4709500,5,B005IIA996,"This May 2010 production of Massenet's 1910 opera ""Don Quichotte"" marked the opera's centenary and also Jose Van Dam's operatic farewell at the Theatre de la Monnaie, Brussels.  It is beautiful in every way--vocally, scenically, sonically, and visually--and a worthy record of Van Dam's farewell.  Van Dam is just shy of 70 in this production, but you would never guess it from his singing or stage movements--a consummate artist.  His is a noble portrayal and deeply moving.  The Act V death scene is a model of beautiful singing and acting.  Spanish mezzo Silvia Tro Santafe is a glittering Dulcinee, with a wonderfully flexible voice and a very pleasing vibrato.  Her experience in baroque opera serves her well in this role, full of rhythmic complexities and subtle ornamentation.  She nails the difficult music Massenet conceived for this character.  Werner Van Mechelen is a beautiful Sancho Panza; his Act IV defense of his humiliated master is extremely affecting and wonderfully sung.  Bernard Villiers does a fine job in the brief but important role of the Chef des Bandits.  And Dulcinee's four suitors, Julie Mossay, Camille Mercks, Gijs van der Linden, and Vincent Delhoum, although newcomers, are excellent and light up the stage whenever they appear.  Marc Minkowski conducts the Orchestra and Chorus of the Monnaie Opera with total commitment and command and emphasizes the score's extreme tautness and brilliant color.

This DVD is a joy to watch and listen to--excellent sound quality for both singers and orchestra and beautifully filmed.  The cinematography in particular is refreshing:  no jarring cuts to closeups and instead frequent shots of the entire stage, making it possible to imagine how the performance looked to an audience member.  Laurent Pelly's whimsical set design--gigantic mounds of paper signifying, by turns, Dulcinee's love letters and the romantic novels that Don Quichotte has dwelt on--was simple but hardly simplistic.  Who would have thought that piles of paper could look so handsome on a stage?  Ms. Tro Santafe manages to slither down the mound of love letters all the while maintaining her vocal and physical poise--great job!

Also included is an excellent film detailing the auditions, rehearsals, costume creation and set design that culminated in the performance.  Van Dam is a thoughtful narrator of the film, with generous samplings of Pelly, the chorus master, orchestra members, etc.  The DVD's packaging is unusually fine, too, and includes a handsome 50-page booklet with essays and bios (in French and English), together with lovely still photos of the production.

The whole package is one of the best conceived opera DVDs I've seen.  It is very satisfying to see Van Dam's great artistry and that of his fellow cast members matched by the efforts of so many individuals who were involved in the production and staging of these performances.  Massenet's (regrettably) seldom-performed opera could not have looked or sounded better than it does in this DVD.",1338595200,53,3019,5.24375
8474754,5,B005IIA996,"Most wonderful production we have seen so far. It exceeded the Lyric performance. Jose Van Dam gave the performance of his life, as it turned out to be his goodbye (retirement) to the Belgian opera theater (La Monaie). They captured the complexity of Don Quichotte as a romantic as well as part of a Robin Hood character. Do not forget to view the making of the opera which is included on the DVD, it helps explain the idea of the stage decor and gives more insight in the main character and what a great opportunity it was for some young singers to be able to learn from a master.",1484006400,,581,4.339449541284404
8474755,5,B005IIA996,"Fine singing in an excellent production - this is a fitting tribute to the great Jose Van Dam.  And my wife, who generally dislikes opera, even liked it very much.",1405209600,,163,4.433333333333334
8474756,3,B005IIA996,"It is a fine production. I like staging, acting, and singing. There are some sweet areas in this opera. But the opera is not great. Conclusion: see this production but do not expect much.",1404000000,,187,4.529411764705882
8474757,5,B005IIA996,my opinion is this is massenet's best. Fantastic performance and would be apreciated by opera lover's as well as musical theartre lovers. After seeing this one really questions the originality of Man of Lamancha. This is a much better interpretation of the don Quixotte story,1357862400,9,275,5.133333333333334
8474758,4,B005IIA996,"Since dvds of Don Quichotte are few and far between, there is  excellent singing, particularly by veteran singer
Jos van Dam. There are just some aspects of the productions in general I do not like.",1356652800,2,198,4.6571428571428575
8474759,2,B005IIA996,"Were it not for Jose Van Dam, this video would be a sham. Apparently modernized, it has no resemblance to the original story  Recorded in 2010, it is also recorded in stereo sound only.  SAD>",1354492800,3,191,4.428571428571429
8474760,1,B005IIA996,"The opera was unknown to me prior to my decision to see it.
Alas, it reminded me of a poorly produced, poorly acted, lacking of virtue high school play!
No memorable songs, no great story line, no acting ability anywhere!
ALAS, i simply can not reccomend it  for any reason at all.",1353628800,,281,4.403846153846154
8474761,5,B005IIA996,"Brilliantly done, a masterpiece by Massenet;  music inspired, production imaginative and Van Dam is superb in the title role of Don Quichotte, I cannot recommend too highly",1352332800,4,172,5.37037037037037
8474762,5,B005IIA996,"An extraordinary production of Don Quichotte. Those of you familiar with the book will enjoy the metaphors and intriguing set design. Those of you familiar with the popular musical, you're in for a real treat. It's magically more passionate than the musical ever could be.",1344470400,9,272,5.066666666666666
8474763,4,B005IIA996,"This opera may be unfamiliar to many but fortunately this disc contains a particularly illuminating 52 minute documentary which clarifies much about the entire production. My advice to all future purchasers therefore would be to watch the documentary first then watch the opera next.

In view of the importance and the excellence of the documentary I shall start this review by very briefly detailing its contents. The documentary provides an in-depth coverage of the several months of preparations preceding the performance. Jos van Dam features in this as an important linking commentator and introduces the auditions and the various stages of soloist, chorus and orchestral rehearsals. The stages of stage design and construction are illustrated as well as costumes and make-up. Acting is rehearsed as well as showing how sword fighting is choreographed to fit the music precisely. The whole concept of the production is explained in detail by the producer and this is interspersed with constructional footage as the sets, costumes and lighting are created and adjusted to fit the concept. All this backstage activity is skilfully cut into extracts from the final stage performance so we can really see how it all goes together, and most importantly, understand why. One is left with an overwhelming respect for such a combination of talents, dedication and sheer sustained hard work.

This production celebrates two important anniversaries - the 100th anniversary of the opera plus the 50th and final anniversary of Jos van Dam's performing career. Although this marks his last production as a singer, his important future in educational and guidance roles is quite clear judging from his considerable involvement in this production in those key ways. The opera itself features just three main leading roles - Don Quichotte, Sancho Panza and Dulcine. Around these key roles revolve the lesser figures involved in Don Quichotte's adventures as his mind deteriorates. The chorus has a demanding musical role but participates dramatically rather as a Greek chorus might. The music is essentially lyrical and undemanding to follow. Massenet was a skilful composer and this remains true even if his popularity is not what it was during his life.

The recording has clear imaging and the camera work is attentive to the demands of the production giving a good 16.9 view. The decision to record in stereo is a complete mystery to me bearing in mind the importance of the issue and the tremendous care that has be taken to produce it. There can be no doubt that a surround sound format would have added greatly to the overall effect and a great opportunity has been lost here.

In general terms I would count this as an interesting opera and well worth getting to know. I found the concept of the production initially confusing but this was largely cleared up for me with the illuminating documentary as described above. All the performers are fully up to the demands of both the production and to the music. In my opinion the lack of surround sound is a real lost opportunity to achieve all-round excellence and for that reason I feel that 4 stars is a more appropriate rating than the full 5 stars. This has been an interesting experience and can be recommended as such whilst not quite being in the front rank of operas such as those created by other contemporary composers such as Puccini, Verdi or Wagner for example.

However, regardless of my personal reservations, I would suggest that this disc still merits serious consideration for purchasers looking for a good modern recording of this relatively rare opera.
