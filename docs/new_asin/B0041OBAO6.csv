4246193,5,B0041OBAO6,"This is absolutely the funniest Britcom (Scotcom) available today. Unfortunately, it will never be shown on PBS because all the characters regularly punctuate their conversations with swear words.  While they are sometimes the Scottish version, there is usually no trouble translating them. That said, it is not really offensive as the characters remind me of how teenage friends talk to one another. Most are used in a teasing or ""one-upmanship"" kind of way.
There are about 3 episodes that have some fairly sexual scenes and I wouldn't exactly describe the series as ""family friendly."" But for late teens to adults this series is laugh-out-loud funny.
There is an undercurrent of affection and concern for elderly people throughout. Many episodes deal with problems common to people on a fixed income.
The series is wonderfully written and the characters develop as it progresses. The first Hogmannay (New Year)special is especially great in that we see, through flashback, the characters in their young, 1970s hayday.
I can't recommend this series highly enough for anyone who enjoys British comedies. It is well worth exploring.",1325808000,5,1132,5.288888888888889
4246194,5,B0041OBAO6,"Still Game is the best British sitcom of recent years. It follows the antics of two Glaswegian pensioners, Jack and Victor and their many friends such as Tam the Misier, Winston, Izza the Gossip, Eric and Tam the elecronics expert. Much of the action takes place in either the pub where Bobby the Barman is the butt of many jokes, his name being Scottish slang for a penis, or in the local shop run by Naveed and his unseen wife Mina. The comedy can be crude but never offensive and you will warm to all the characters and the sense of community portrayed in the show.",1297814400,4,568,4.367924528301887
