2799377,2,B000OT6V0A,"I bought this movie because I support most African-American films. My local radio station made a big deal about Rae Dawn and Blilly Dee being in the film. I will admit the actors in the movie were great, but the script was poorly written. There was also too much music in was not needed to fill gaps in between scenes. The movie takes place due to the death of Gabrielle Union Caramel), who is the sister of Billy Dee Williams in the movie. Williams has a phobia about attending family events like graduations, birthdays, funerals, so the family lie to get him there with the hopes they can ""force"" him to attend. Ultimatley the movie then draws you to the characters surrounding the attendance of the funeral and their relationships that need some repairing, I had hope for this movie, but the end was very much lacking when the whole purpose of coming together was not met and also, what should have been a major focus which was Caramel's realationship with a White man was not as enhanced as it should have been. The second star is because although this was a terrible script the actors did their best.",1180569600,2,1105,4.557788944723618

2799391,3,B000OT6V0A,"This was a movie that I think I may have expected too much from.  To my understanding, the distribution or production or whatever had been in limbo for awhile, but it eventually made it to some select theaters.  None in my area of course, so I had to wait for the dvd.  I own it and will watch it again but I think there was a little too much complexity going on.  There actually could have been more than one story here.  There was the broken relationship between Zoe Saldana's character and her father.  Evidently, she was a ""love child"" in a sense, as it was never fully revealed as to whether or not Rae Dawn Chong's character was ever married to Billy Dee William's character.  There was the mystery of why Melissa De Sousa's character and her spouse were having problems.  There was the relationship between Zoe Saldana and Hill Harper's characters that was clearly not dead. There was the resentment Billy Dee's character felt toward the interracial relationship between his deceased sister and ""Bear"", who I am also going to safely assume could have actually been of Native American ancestry in regard to his name.  Billy Dee's character was in an interracial marriage as well so I am not sure where all Billy Dee's anger continued to stem from.  There are a lot of unanswered questions for me but I enjoyed the film.  There were some wonderful actors, from the elders Billy Dee Williams and Lesley Ann Warren, to the younger generation Hill Harper, Gabrielle Union, Melissa De Sousa and Zoe Saldana.  The backdrop of the movie was set against the beautiful landscape and history of Huntsville, Alabama.  The music was calming and peaceful throughout the entire film.",1265155200,,1675,4.73448275862069

2799393,2,B000OT6V0A,"I've watched this movie several times, mostly to pick out all the scenes from my beloved hometown of Huntsville, Alabama.  It shows this place for what it is...a gorgeous, culturally diverse, upscale city.  The exterior shots show off my hometown wonderfully (and it all really looks like that, except we don't have a restaurant on the roof of the Times building).

The setting and the eclectic soundtrack are the best things in it.

There are some wonderful actors trying their best with almost no script that matters (although Billy Dee seems half-asleep a lot of the time).

Every reaction shot is at least twice as long as it needs to be, and most scenes are, too. It's one very slow hour and a half.

My favorite scene is when a stunned, disoriented Billy Dee wanders into Melvins BBQ Place. After one of the locals tries cheerily to figure out what he wants or where is trying to go,  and is met with stares and gibberish--the local man switches to deep concern: ""Can I give you a ride someplace, man?""  Its just so honest and deeply Southern.

It's still a popular film on BET and women's drama networks, and I can see why. It's ultimately about healing family wounds and choosing to reach out to those you love. It's also slow as molasses in January, and just as super-sweet.",1232755200,,1283,4.592105263157895
2799394,5,B000OT6V0A,"This movie is for those that know what unrequited love feels like and how it can rule your life.  I know exactly what the characters feel and was surprised at the moving scenes that unexpectedly came up, Billy Dee and Glenn Plummer for example.  Perhaps you have to have experienced these situations to appreciate them.  Emotional traumas take a very heavy toll on the heart and sometimes are never completely resolved.  I Love this movie and am grateful I was able to experience this Rich Drama of the Heart with the Incredible Soundtrack.",1229472000,,540,4.774193548387097

2799396,2,B000OT6V0A,"I was going to buy this off of Amazon but something told me to rent it first and I'm glad I did.  This could have been a real good movie with a better script.  The acting was superb; I was so excited to see Rae Dawn Chong, but other than that I was so NOT impressed with this movie.  I'd have to watch it twice to really figure out was going on because the story is so all over the place you just really have no idea whats going on.  Only thing is, it's so boring I couldn't even bother to watch it again.  Honestly, I was quite angry by the time the movie ended.  I'm not going to discourage anyone from buying this, but I will encourage you to rent before you buy.  And if you're still intent on buying then please watch the movie and try not to be distracted by other things because it deserves attention.....ugh!!

This movie is certainly being removed from my shopping cart.",1199145600,,879,4.159763313609467
2799397,1,B000OT6V0A,"At first glance given the cast line up, I thought Constellation would be a great movie.  However, The characters and the set were the only good parts of this film.  As for the storyline, it is totally all over the place.  Whoever wrote this movie seemingly had a bunch of ideas and just threw them into one movie with no order or smooth transition from one scene to the next.  The movie jumps around too much and you have no idea why this scene is following that scene.  Totally unorganized and poorly written and directed.  The storyline is difficult to follow from all the inconsistencies in the plot, and I never really saw a love story develop like the cover described.  I just got it as a rental and I want my money back!",1190332800,4,726,4.373134328358209
2799398,3,B000OT6V0A,"First off thos movie had an excellent cast with a hard job of connecting the people in this movie. It took me a while to know how and why the people were connected. It was a moving story of the family of Caramel Boxer. Her life, love, and hurt were presented in a sad, but tasteful fashion. I want to give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars because it was emotional, driven, and beautifully written, but the scenes were jumbled and not inspiring. I will have to watch it again, because I see that the director wanted the movie to be like a constellation. You may only see one star (person), but they are apart of the whole constellation (family). The quotes from this movie were amazing. I am going to add them to my facebook page. Be patient with this movie and you will not regret it.
I would very much like to have had a soundtrack to this movie. The songs were moving and excellent.",1188691200,3,878,4.263473053892215

I liked the lesson of forgiveness.",1188345600,2,326,7.3076923076923075
2799401,1,B000OT6V0A,"I am from Huntsville, Alabama, and like most Huntsville residents I find this community an exceptional place to live, work, and raise a family. I can only sense that the writers, editors, and directors of this film feel the same way. Which is why they produced this film? The actors each gave good performances. But the script was poor, the direction was rushed, and the film editing was, well..., bad. This film was painful to watch, and I can only recommend watching to those who may find it interesting to see the more recognizable places in Huntsville. That was enjoyable.",1188086400,2,576,4.77
2799402,4,B000OT6V0A,"I just happened to stumble upon this movie while strolling through Blockbuster.  I loved the message of unconditional love and forgiveness which was conveyed throughout the movie.  And I do feel that the songs were very much appropriate and even moving.  This is one of those few movies that I can watch more than once and still feel as though I've learned something new about life and love each time.

2799403,4,B000OT6V0A,"I rented CONSTELLATION and hadn't considered reviewing it.  While looking over the reviews, I wanted to add my two cents.

CONSTELLATION is a great movie about family, loves and forgiveness.  Carmel Boxer, played by Gabrielle Union, narrates her life story.  She begins by telling you about a love she shared with a white soldier, Bear, during the time when it was clear that blacks and whites shouldn't mix.  As the film goes on you realize that the family is gathering to mourn the loss of Carmel and it's apparent that times have changed as her younger brother, Helms, played by Billy Dee Williams, was married to a white woman and their daughter married a white man.  While times have apparently changed, Helms and his daughter are both dealing with so much hurt from the past.  Will this family ever recover?

CONSTELLATION has a wonderful cast and it's a movie that you can watch with the entire family.  I recommend to all.",1185667200,10,930,4.726708074534161
2799404,3,B000OT6V0A,"""Constellation,"" which begins in 1940's Alabama, tells the tale of a secret, forbidden love between a black woman named Carmel and a white soldier named Bear, whose romance is cut short when he is shipped overseas to fight in the war.  Flash forward fifty years to the funeral of Carmel - who never married after breaking up with Bear - which serves as the pretext for all the principal people in her life to gather together to air out their grievances and to thrash out the personal relationship problems that have haunted them all their lives.  The participants include her emotionally distant brother and his two ex-wives; her two adult nieces and their respective men folk; and Bear himself, who, despite the fact that the two of them were kept apart all their lives by the restrictions of a racist society, has decided to pay not only for the services, but to put all these people up in one of the swankier hotels in Huntsville, Alabama.

Though there are a goodly number of insightful, touching moments in ""Constellation,"" the movie probably would have been more effective had the screenplay (by director Jordan Walker-Pearlman) not tried to cram so many different characters into such a relatively short space of time (the movie runs barely over an hour and a half).  Yes, I understand that the theme of the movie is all about how we form ""constellations"" with the people who are most important to us in life, but speaking strictly in narrative terms, much too often, the genuinely compelling travails of one character are shunted aside to make room for the far less interesting problems of another.  Moreover, the romantic relationship between Carmel and Bear, which is supposed to function as the emotional cornerstone of the movie, is never made all that convincing.  We are TOLD that these two people are in love with each other, but we aren't made to FEEL it.  In addition, Aunt Carmel is portrayed as such a wise and ethereal earth-mother presence even after death that she is essentially robbed of her own individuality and humanity as a character.

Still, there is much that is good in the movie, starting with the performances of Billy Dee Williams, as a man incapable of making emotional connections with the people in his life, and Rae Dawn Chong, as the daughter who has the most trouble dealing with this reality.  They are ably abetted by Lesley Ann Warren, Zoe Saldana, Melissa De Souza, and Hill Harper.  The movie also boasts a flavorful soundtrack, filled with an eclectic mixture of musical styles, ranging from classical to hip hop to spiritual.  The Huntsville setting  also provides a refreshing change for audiences weary of seeing New York, Los Angeles and Chicago constantly being recycled in film after film, as if they were the only urban centers moviemakers had to choose from.

The movie does lay its message on a bit thickly towards the end, employing heavy-handed speech-making and rather obvious symbolism to get its points across.  It really doesn't need to go to all that effort, since the viewers could probably figure the themes out on their own given half a chance.

Yet, although ""Constellation"" is a decidedly mixed bag as far as family and social dramas go, it has enough elements of quality to make it worth checking out.",1184457600,30,3269,4.833333333333333
2799405,4,B000OT6V0A,"This movie is wonderfully scripted and acted and illustrates perfectly the importance of family, regardless the makeup of that family. It teaches many lessons about unconditional love and commitment, following your heart and what happens when you succumb to the pressures of the world. There are enough twists to hold your interest, and enough personal flaws to make each character believable. Treat yourself to a good story with a great message.",1183852800,8,446,5.295774647887324

2799407,4,B000OT6V0A,"First off, I will have to agree with the other party who said that this movie is about connecting the dots if you wish to check it out. I went to buy this at the local video rental place and he told me that everyone who watched that film, hated it and suggested watching The Brother instead. I feel that the movie is a good idea. Real great, but too disjointed. For one thing, why did they feel the need to lie to Helms about the actual funeral? and although I understood the majority of the film, I find it distasteful that Rae Dawn Chong's found Helms so attractive due to the fact he was married to begin with. Other than that, it's an ok watch.",1183075200,,648,4.150793650793651

2799409,1,B000OT6V0A,"this movie sucked. i picked it up from blockbuster becasue i saw all the prominent black actors on the cover and though they did their best they still couldn't pull this off.  the movie was really not cohesive and definitely not in trying to explain the story.  though you get the basic jist of the movie, it should have done more to explain the background.  for example, we don't know what really happened between carmel and bear all we know is because of race they couldn't be together. we don't get to see or understand all that happened those years after that. all we know is they wrote letters still and he paid for the funeral and everything.  we don't know why helms and his daughter don't have a relationship, it is implied that it has something to do with the fact that her mother was ""the other woman"" but nothing else. i really left this movie with a big huh?. the script writing wasn't particularly good and as stated nothing was explained and sometimes explanation isn't needed but we as the viewer definitely needed more. and though it is trivial why do we never see carmel as an older woman, she stays the same physically in every single flashback. though it was a good attempt and does have a message about forgiveness and moving past the past, it doesnt quite pull it off. thumbs down. i wouldnt suggest anyone waste there hour and thirty six minutes trying to figure this one out, its simply not worth it.",1181779200,,1423,4.503875968992248
2799410,1,B000OT6V0A,"I was under the impression that this was going to be a good movie. But boy was I wrong. The story was all over the place and it takes 30 mins to figure who's who in the movie. Movie doesn't really do a good job of laying down the foundation of the movie. I thought the movie was more about the main character but it was really about the main character's brother and his family. Rent Kingdom Come, it's pretty much the same thing but a little bit better.",1181347200,2,453,4.101123595505618
2799411,5,B000OT6V0A,"This is a film that does not ""spell out"" the story for you. You connect the dots (""constellation"") on your own. This is an engaging, almost interactive film. When I saw it in the theater in New York City, the audience was full and literally talking back to the movie with ""yeah, yeah!"" etc.

I am not African-American but I still strongly connected to the story.  The themes of family forgiveness & when in doubt, holding on to the ""love""  beyond anything else, will resonate with any person, regardless of gender, age, race, religion, etc.

This film does not follow a conventional formula; it feels like you are plunged into another world, only to find yourself looking into a mirror where pieces of your own life reflect back.

I personally hope for more films like ""Constellation.""",1181347200,6,785,4.742647058823529
