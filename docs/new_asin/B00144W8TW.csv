8254467,5,B00144W8TW,Bought it for a teacher friend who teaches culinary to high school students. Students really liked it and learned a lot about earlier methods as well as current methods for butchering.,1375747200,,184,4.967741935483871
8254468,5,B00144W8TW,"If you like the Modern Marvels series this episode will deliver.  I remember going to our local butchershop for meats/cheese and how personable the buther was.  With all the assembly line foods out there, the butcher is a dying breed - how sad!",1363996800,,244,4.651162790697675
8254469,3,B00144W8TW,"I expected this to me more from the consumer's point of view, but it discusses meat more from a commercial point of view.  It was well filmed, but just not quite what I expected.",1357689600,,178,4.235294117647059

8254471,5,B00144W8TW,"I saw this on TV and it is a fascinating documentary on the butcher industry.

It's a bizarre topic, but somehow they made it fascinating. I love the History channel!",1348358400,,166,4.533333333333333
8254472,4,B00144W8TW,"Interesting to see how the industry has changed so much in the last 100 years. Some graphic footage, but lets us see how things operate inside. Nice piece on knife sharpening too. Like anything in demand, if the people want it, someone will provide it!!... Now let's go eat!!!",1303516800,,276,4.653061224489796
8254473,3,B00144W8TW,"""The Butcher"" provides background information on the meat-cutting industry; unfortunately, it is a topic of limited appeal that involves enormous and unpleasant actions.  (Trust me - I used to work for Armour Foods.)

Two million-some years ago humans had only stone tools to remove meat; about 5,000 years ago we learned to make bronze tools for cutting.

Knife steel contains 1+% carbon, is heat-treated, and then rapidly cooled.  This leaves it brittle - a problem removed by reheating it for two hours at 550 degrees.  Band saws have made meat cutters' task considerably easier.

Colonial butchers salted meat to preserve it.

Chicago became the U.S. meat-packing capital in the 19th century.  Plants originally were largely vertical structures that relied on gravity and chains to transport carcasses.  The highly-skilled butcher's job was broken down into mostly simple tasks to reduce costs.  Unsafe and unsanitary conditions were highlighted in Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" (1906) that resulted in USDA inspections.

The first refrigerated rail car began service in 1875 (Swift) - it was cooled via ice that was refilled along the way.

Chicago's stockyards were closed in 1971 - made obsolete by newer plants located closer to farms, along with improved service provided by the trucking industry.

""The Butcher"" goes on to show hides being steamed and rinsed for sanitation, peeled by a mechanical hide-puller, carcasses split, aged up to 2 weeks, cut into smaller pieces, and then vacuum-packaged.  Sausage-making is also briefly treated, though little detail on ingredients is provided.  Smoked meats are not covered.

""The Butcher"" then moves on to the increased risk of rapidly spread disease - especially in hamburger.  A 1994 e-coli outbreak led to testing for e-coli.  Mad Cow disease has become another threat, causing major disruption to overseas meat shipments because of the fear caused by the lack of any cure for the disease and the inability to prevent it through cooking.

Also missing from ""The Butcher"" is any reference to how the industry has become a magnet for hiring illegals, the fast speed of the disassembly line, and the multiple injuries incurred by workers.",1223942400,9,2194,5.252873563218391
