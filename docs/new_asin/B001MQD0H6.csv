3698599,5,B001MQD0H6,"I liked this dvd because it is funny, has great characters, and a good story line.  It is a love story between a femail cyborg (Ayase Haruka) and a Japanese teenager who lost his family in an earthquake. If you like femail cyborgs this is the ideal DVD for you. The only issue I had was working out which Japanese words meant English for the sub headings. It is the first word in the list.",1360108800,,389,4.1866666666666665

If you like the realtionship between John and Cameron in Terminator Sarah Connor you will enjoy this.",1254182400,,174,4.4375
3698601,4,B001MQD0H6,"Ever wonder how and what we can affect in our past, present and future? Let's see, now what if James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" had a strong theme of a love story in it? Sounds stupid doesn't it? Well, director Kwak Jae-Young's ""Cyborg She"" (aka. Cyborg Girl, 2008) made in collaboration with Japanese filmmakers is one effective romantic sci-fi film that is endearing, charming and quite good. Trust me, I HATE romantic comedies but this film totally took me by surprise. Many are a bit confused that ""Cyborg She"" is a remake/re-imagining of Park Chan-Wook's ""I'm a Cyborg But That's Ok""...and that's ok. Both films do have similarities and themes but they are not connected at all in any intentional way.

Jiro (Koide Koisuke) is a nerdish working student who meets a mysterious, beautiful young woman (bikini model Haruka Ayase, Ichi) on his birthday in November, 2007. The two spend the evening together and before the night is over, she leaves for the night; leaving Jiro to reminisce about her for an entire year. One year later, Jiro meets his mysterious dream girl once again to find out that she is the ""Cyberdyne Model 103"" sent back by Jiro himself from the future to avert a tragedy that paralyses him. The two form a strange bond as Jiro slowly begins to develop feelings for his synthetic companion. (Who can blame Jiro since this cyborg is the hottest thing I've ever seen!) She also becomes a minor ""secret"" celebrity as she uses her tech-enhanced powers to stop certain disasters before they happen. Jiro's happiness may well be short-lived as things begin to unravel that reveal his friend's true purpose.

""Cyborg She"" or ""Cyborg Girl"" is one film that borrows heavily from themes established by ""The Terminator"" and ""The Back to the Future"" movies. The results are mixed, and truth be told, its science of time travel may be a little too unexplored. However, director Kwak Jae-Young's style of storytelling is very energetic, witty, charming and unpredictable. The man is in familiar territory as he is the same director who directed the Korean blockbuster hit ""My Sassy Girl"". The man avoids the usual stereotypical trappings of a romantic comedy and focuses instead on sci-fi elements and time travel mythos. Kwak's inventive touches at humor and superb storytelling techniques are evident in the film as he serves up a satisfyingly fun film.

Now this is a Japanese film so expect a touch of certain thought-provoking themes such as heart and soul. The Cyborg herself is a learning computer and in time, it will develop its human characteristics. Just what makes a human? Is it the way we were born or the way we live and experience life. According to Kwak, our actions and experiences are what makes us human; the question is: Is it because of mere programming or is does a machine develop a soul? Besides this, ""Cyborg She"" establishes its own science in the laws of time travel. It may become a bit difficult to follow as the story unravels but not to worry, Kwak manages to explain everything and puts it all together in the end. This thematic film successfully sidesteps the clichs of romantic comedies and manages to give the viewer quite a few surprises. Sure, it borrows from movies such as ""Ghost In the Shell"", ""A.I."" and ""The Terminator"" but the storytelling is solid enough that I was quite pleased with its execution.

The visual effects are also quite impressive. I loved the scenes of the earthquake set to destroy Tokyo. You can literally feel the city breaking apart and the scenes were able to express the fear and the loss after such a disaster. The scenes whenever the Cyborg utilizes her superhuman abilities are also top notch. The film has mild displays of violence and blood but none so graphic that may turn off mainstream watchers. The time travel effects resemble those seen in Hollywood movies made of similar nature.

Now, I may be giving the impression that the film has its bleakness to it but it merely serves as a balance to the film's endearing nature. There are quite a lot of scenes that I found genuinely amusing that I almost laughed myself silly. I loved the scenes when she eats, accidentally gets drunk and frightens Jiro's professor. The way Haruka Ayase just exudes that innocence much like a child and warm charisma even though she is playing a cyborg. Oh, she even does the ""robot"" dance moves when she finds herself in a club with Jiro. Ayase is definitely able to create a likeable, stiff artificial being. The love story between her and Jiro does start off simply enough, in an awkward fashion but their controlled performances give viability to their romance. Koide Koisuke is also charming as the nerdy Jiro, in a manner that is definitely Otaku/anime-like. The film is largely a success because of its performers.

Much as I hate romantic comedies, ""Cyborg She"" is a wild blend of action, sci-fi fantasy elements and inventive humor that will undoubtedly charm its way to its viewers' heart. The viewer is given time to form an attachment to its attractive leading lady and invest in the romance that develops between the two leads. The loopy time travel thing may be a little hard to follow, but I know enough about the physics of time travel to buy into what the film is trying to say. Some folks may nit-pick its time travel mythos but this is not what the film is all about. It is about experiences that affect the past, present and the future or that the past, the present and the future affect each other. It is a love that transcends time.

Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]

The Malaysian Release sports an impressive 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen transfer with great 5.1 Dolby Digital/DTS soundtrack. The subtitles are very good.",1252368000,4,5711,4.796747967479675
3698602,5,B001MQD0H6,"Oh boy did I like this movie!  A little more my speed really than ""My Sassy Girl"" (which I liked a lot as well), this one had more science fiction elements to keep us guys from getting too restless.  Plenty of screwball comedy and romance too and I'm a sucker for both when they're well done.  I thought they were both done awfully well here.

I really liked both the guy and the cyborg girl, she is really something else.  At first I just figured he wasn't worthy, but you know, thank Heaven that sometimes the ladies ain't looking for Superman!  I wound up really rooting for this poor average Joe especially as any hopes of him getting his girl seemed to get just more and more impossibly complicated as more was revealed about her and what she really was.

Kudos to the writers for really doing some neat twists and turns, they could have been a lot lazier at times and I still would have been pretty happy (yah, the girl is mighty, mighty cute).  And listen up guys, there's some really cool action and special effects so you'll be able to stay awake while you watch this with your honey!  Just make sure she doesn't hear you sniffling any...",1240704000,3,1147,4.398104265402844

8321569,5,B001MQD0H6,"A very cleverly build love story. Some reviewers complained about the apparent repetition of the scenes towards the end of the movie.

What I saw was a beautiful love story told from the boy's perspective at the beginning of the movie that ends with the question: Did he accomplish the task of building a soul in the cyborg as he was asked?

There is an interval in the story that apparently, at least that's how i took it, shows that cyborg's ""soul"" reborn into human form and looking for ""her other half"".

Then, the last part of the movie, now told from the girl's perspective. Note the subtle camera angle of the apparent repeated scenes and you will see it is not a repeat of the scenes at the beginning of the movie. And the ending is just great: I could not forget the girl's smile...

Fortunately, I understand Japanese and that allowed me to grasp some nuances in the dialogues that the English subtitle (although a very good one) cannot really convey and that is, in my opinion, what lost the other reviewers...",1426896000,,1021,4.532608695652174

This is an amazing movie! I usually don't like subtitled films, but this is an exception. The characters are memorable, the storyline interesting, and the ending - well, it's a bit like A.I. (just when you thought it was over... it's not!) A truly creative movie!",1371427200,2,430,4.375

There are some plot twists in this film but what I didn't like is the the repeating scenes near the end of the movie. For those of you watched it, you'll know what I mean. The title says it all. It's a cyborg who travels in the past and meets this timid guy. Of course, the guy develops feelings for a robot and things don't go turn out well for the both of them.
