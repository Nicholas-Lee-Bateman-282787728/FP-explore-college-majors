6245403,5,B00I099K4U,"We own season one and we just purchased season seven and eight as we want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

We read a review saying how this show used to be on Netflix and was for some reason taking off of Netflix, don't know why... But it is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and The Cosby Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show so it is in demand!

While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(demand for this show is good)(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!

Bill Cosby is great and we are thankful to enjoy such talent! We wish that the Fatherhood cartoon would be released on DVD. Two seasons on Nick Nite (2004-2005 season run time and has been canceled). and twenty six episodes.. This was a great cartoon with values, please release this on DVD. And also Little Bill on DVD.

Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin show, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx show, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.

Shipping was as expected, we are in the process of view all the DVD's to see how they play.

Thanks.",1336089600,,3380,4.08446455505279
6245404,5,B00I099K4U,"I had never watched ""The Cosby Show"" until I got pregnant and my husband decided to start watching it on Netflix. I immediately loved it and wanted to watch the whole thing - all 8 seasons - before our baby was born. Well, that obviously didn't happen but we kept watching it even after our baby girl was born, until one day Netflix decided to remove ""The Cosby Show"" from the ""watch instantly"" feature and we had to stop. I was so frustrated that I decided I wanted to buy all 8 seasons of The Cosby Show - not only so that I could finish it, but also to be able to show it to my daughter when she's older! So, we purchased all 8 seasons and I'm so glad we did because we now own hours and hours of comedy that will always be timeless and entertaining.

Before I purchased from this seller, I looked at other sellers from which I could order the same product and have it shipped through Amazon Prime, however, their product was about $100.00 more expensive than from this seller, and it was the exact same product!

6245417,4,B00I099K4U,"Below is the review I gave for series 1&2.  The only correction I would make is that I would give series 3 a 5/5 for the reasons I listed at the very bottom of my review for series 1&2.  I would give season 4 a 4/5 for the same reason(s), but Amazon does not allow 4.5/5 reviews, which is what I would really give this 3&4 set.

""Look, either you LOVE The Cosby Show, or you don't. I will not go into a lengthy discussion of what the show is about or what my favorite episodes/seasons are, since I believe others in the amazon community to be better versed and more expressive than myself in the language arts :)

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, The Cosby Show! It is the most fun show for me to watch, yes even some 20-years later (has it been that long... hmmm??). It is innocent fun, with sometimes corny messages (DEFINITELY not as bad as Disney channel shows, though), but seriously I can't stand most of what I see on TV lately. I mostly enjoy 30-minute sitcoms, and frankly there aren't too many of those around that don't get into politics/religion-bashing/other-people-bashing/crude sex jokes (I'm absolutely not a prude, but crudeness I find annoying lately). Kind of sick of the ""Me""-culture these days, so I started ordering complete dvd series of my favorite shows, this being one of them. Sometimes, I just want to laugh at innocent silliness rather than a mean joke or put-down. The world has enough jerks to fill my cup in that regard, so The Cosby Show is my retreat from that.

Frankly, I'm not sure you can force this show on your children if they have already been exposed & addicted to the unadulterated crap out there, but certainly worth a try. A major aspect of the message this show repeatedly conveys is R-E-S-P-E-C-T (respecting the authority of parents, respecting siblings, respecting friends, respecting oneself, respecting one's fallibility/limits, respecting achievement at a proper cost - not the do or die mentality, respecting that people may have differing opinions, respecting that 2 adults can choose for themselves what role to play in a marriage/family, respecting that women are equal to men without the outright anti-men feminism en vogue these days, etc).

I believe Bill Cosby (and staff) did a superb job casting each character. I also believe that if the characters had been cast any other way, the show may not have been nearly as good as it was/is. I remember every character: Claire's soft motherliness always reminded me of my mom when I was a child, Theo's lack of scholarly motivation reminded me of my brother at times, Cliff made me wish my dad was more like him (so I took my dad's ways and added Cliff's advise on top), Rudy's frustrations at being the youngest reminded me of myself at times, and occasionally my girlfriend and I will laughingly refer to the Vanessa character because of how annoyingly whiny, nosy and gossipy that character was - come on, we all know at least 1 person in our life who whines & complains about everything, gossips, but acts all innocent and unassuming at the same time (lol).

If I were to choose which compilation set I enjoy best, it would be 1&2 vs 3&4 (the only 2 I had the financial ability to purchase for now). I think it is because I like having a very young child vs pre-adolescent child in family shows. That is why I also really want to get the last couple of seasons when Olivia was around. Bill Cosby has a really fun-loving way of connecting with children that age on the show, bringing out the best in him and the other actors (just my personal opinion).

But in any case, you cannot go wrong with any season if all you compare it to is what is currently out there now in the genre/market.""",1324512000,,3684,4.588145896656535

8637882,5,B00I099K4U,"The Cosby Show reined supreme in the Nielsen ratings from 1984 to 1992. The first season won an Emmy for comedy series. The cast were impeccable talented with Bill Cosby and Phylicia Ayers Allen Rashad played Cliff and Clair Huxtable, a doctor and lawyer living with their children in a fashionable Brooklyn brownstone. The children including teenage daughter Denise (Lisa Bonet); son Theo (Malcolm Jamal Warner); younger preteen daughter Vanessa (Tempest Bledsoe) and the youngest and cutest Rudy (Keshia Knight-Pullman) in the cast. The series was shot in New York City during its entire run.

The series won plenty of awards including several People's Choice Awards for Comedy Series consecutively over the years. Everybody wanted to be a Huxtable including myself. The series revolutionized the sitcom genre in the mid eighties and helped keep struggling comedies like ""Cheers"" and ""Family Ties"" afloat.

Brandon Tartikoff was programming genius and in charge of NBC network. If he liked a series even with struggling ratings, he would keep it on long enough Til it found an audience.

The third and fourth seasons of the Cosby Show are just as wonderful as the first two seasons. Denise goes off to fictional Hillman College and there is touching third season finale episode. Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia with the cast. Lisa Bonet makes appearances throughout the third and fourth seasons. Sandra and Eldin get married offscreen and return to Brooklyn with big plans for their future. Clair is noticeably absent during the third season perhaps because she was pregnant in real life.

The guest stars included a young Adam Sandler as one of Theo's friend; Christopher Plummer and Roscoe Lee Browne in one episode; Earl Hyman and Clarice Taylor as Cliff's parents; Robert Culp and Ann Reinking appear as old friends; Carmen De Lavallade; Gates McFadden; Eileen Heckart; Louis Nye; Meg Foster; Joel Fabiani and many others.

This DVD set includes 4 discs with two seasons worth of laugh and memories. The series was wholesome and educational without being obvious. In the eighties, everybody watched this series on Thursday nights. It was the beginning of the first must see television lineup.",1507680000,,2202,5.174157303370786
