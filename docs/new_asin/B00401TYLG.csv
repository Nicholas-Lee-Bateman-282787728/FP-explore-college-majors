8411549,5,B00401TYLG,"I am new to quilting, new to applique and new to fusible. Sharon Pederson presented the information about these great quilt blocks with such precision and attention to detail that I feel like I could take on any of the blocks shown and be successful. It is like spending a couple of hours with a girlfriend who is showing you the ropes and including all of the trade secrets. I am so glad that I decided on this video and am confident that I can try the fusible method with my Accuquilt Rose of Sharon dies. I am also going to give her turned edge applique a try with a different project. Don't hesitate to order this great DVD, you won't be sorry!!",1395705600,,649,4.284552845528455
8411550,5,B00401TYLG,"This DVD is a great tool for those who are beginning quilter's or those wishing to make an applique quilt using various cutting methods.  Sharon Pederson is so very clear and precise with her instructions that one cannot misunderstand the steps or techniques she is teaching.  The DVD is chockful of everything one needs to know about making this quilt and in making any kind of quilt for that matter.  There are Chapters from the supplies one will need to finally finishing the quilt by actually quilting it.  I recommend looking at one to three chapters at a time, because there is so much information that I just can't sit for anymore chapters than that.

There is also a book by the same title as the DVD, I have it and it is nice to have as a companion to the DVD.  I learn better visually than by reading, and having the book allows me to see the quilt blocks much better than the PDF that comes with the DVD.  Sharon has some humor in the DVD as well.  A portion of the cost of this DVD or the book will go to and benefit the Alzheimer's Association.  I am so thankful that I bought this item.  I've learned so much.",1346544000,,1123,4.279620853080568
8411551,5,B00401TYLG,While browsing Amazon I came across this book as a quilter I went no further I was mesmerise by the illustration and explanation thanks to Amazon that allow us to preview the pages I am now a owner of a beautiful book that will give me many hours of fun and has taught me a few new thing about quilting. Thanks Amazon,1332460800,,317,4.129032258064516
8411552,5,B00401TYLG,"I chose the DVD version over the book, because the DVD offered ~all~ the finalist block patterns to the Rose of Sharon challenge.  The book only offers patterns for the blocks on the quilt.  There are a lot of pretty and usable blocks that were not chosen.

 Much to my delight,  the DVD has a 3+ hour lecture/demo of Sharon Pederson's machine appliqu  techniques used to make the final quilt.  I've done machine  applique for years,  and I learned some new tips and tricks from this DVD that will make my work better and easier.  Sharon Pederson's presentation is very clear, and enjoyable to watch.

This DVD will be a nice addition to anyone's quilting  resources.",1287532800,18,667,4.655172413793103
