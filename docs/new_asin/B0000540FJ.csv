7930613,5,B0000540FJ,I love Dragon Ball Z and own them all on dvd but i like tbe episode in this movie the part where their on the grand kia's planet and he leads all the warriors to yhe secret room when they walk in it looks like space with planets and the music that goes with it is really neat. I just love that part and cant get enough of it. I wish they really had rooms that looked like that in life.,1497571200,,385,3.765432098765432
7930614,5,B0000540FJ,good story and characters lots of action to keep your interest.,1479081600,,63,4.818181818181818

7930616,5,B0000540FJ,"I recommend buying from this seller.
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,291,4.407407407407407
7930617,3,B0000540FJ,"OK, I admit I am relatively uninformed on all things ""Dragonball Z,"" but I found this old VHS in a store recently and decided to examine it. As an adult I found it nearly incomprehensible, but then again I didn't start from the beginning. This tape contains three episodes which take our heroes on various adventures involving a kidnapped baby dinosaur in the grasp of an evil circus promoter, Gohan's stab at show business, and a familial story which finds both Gohan and little brother Goten at the level of Super Saiyan. The third was my favorite as it involved both unorthodox flying lessons and stunning hair restyling, all wrapped in the patina of a mind-bogglingly unfathomable plot that starts long before these three episodes, and ends (presumably) long after them.

This was a bargain and was an interesting introduction to anime for me. Although I won't pursue the series further, it definitely did help me appreciate comic parodies such as ""Perfect Hair Forever"" much more.",1341532800,,985,4.933734939759036
7930618,3,B0000540FJ,"Declaration is comical, its probably more entertaining for children then the older dragon ball z fans .But for anyone who wants to collect every episode of dbz it will be good .",1242777600,,177,4.5625
7930619,1,B0000540FJ,"Is stupid and annoying. One word for Gohan's love interest ""Witch""
 or ""Evil incarnate"".
 Strong words. Gohan ""moron"" amazing they rhyme.
Really lame. Eat some Fruit Loops and Cocoa Puffs more intellectually sound than this drivel.",1024617600,,231,5.388888888888889
7930620,5,B0000540FJ,"well what can i say??
Gohan-chan is so cute!!LOL
plus its so funny esp. when angela catches him wearing teddy underware!
well i hope every1 who has watched this vid had fun!!",1012608000,4,174,4.46875
7930621,3,B0000540FJ,"This movie is good.. but not as good as i've seen. It shows you more of the Dragon Ball Z universe, but it still only shows the kaios (God of galaxies) hierarchy, and none of the Kaio-shin (God of galaxy clusters). Not much action, and Goku doesn't even go SSJ. However, this video has it's moments; the action scenes with Pikehan are extremely cool! And as stated before, this is much more of a filler to the DBZ plot, just like all of the DBZ movies.
Verdict: Rent it, borrow it, or get it from the library. Buying it is not a good way to spend your money.",993686400,,558,4.175925925925926
