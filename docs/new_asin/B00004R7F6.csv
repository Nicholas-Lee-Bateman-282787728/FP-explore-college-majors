7920624,1,B00004R7F6,"First of all, let me say, I bought this movie because it had Hill Harper in it.  No real plot , the characters were just gophers working for Hollywood execs griping about how much they hated their jobs.  That's the whole movie in a nutshell.  Additionally the home movie effect did not help matters any.",1255651200,,303,4.472727272727273
7920625,5,B00004R7F6,"This film is really funny. If you're thinking about working in Hollywood or want to know what it's like, this film is the WALL STREET of the Making-It-In-Hollywood genre. Better than SWIMMING WITH SHARKS and a lot  funnier.",961804800,2,223,4.868421052631579
7920626,5,B00004R7F6,This is one of the funniest Hollywood satires ever! Check out this indie gem and be ready for an evening of laughter and insight! Terry Keefe and Mike Wechsler are two names to watch.,951436800,2,183,4.411764705882353
