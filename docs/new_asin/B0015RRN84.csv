3147187,5,B0015RRN84,wonderful refreshing show......a Classic which should be re-run often.....will probably order more for gifts to be given away at holiday times,1369267200,,142,5.809523809523809
3147188,5,B0015RRN84,It was a great rainy day comedy and having both on one track was great too..... I would recommend it to anyone,1367798400,,110,4.045454545454546
3147189,5,B0015RRN84,"My wife wanted the double version because she'd seen ""La Cage Aux Folles"" (1979 version) soon after it came out, and remembered that it was hilarious, even though it had only subtitles then.  It is why we watched ""The Birdcage"" (1996) on TV, and enjoyed it immensely.  So we watched both on this DVD, and now this DVD has an option for English voiceover for the original French version, for those who don't like subtitles.

However, my wife decided that the original is just not as funny as ""The Birdcage"" with Robin Williams.  ""The Birdcage"" is very true to ""La Cage Aux Folles"", with only a few minor exceptions.  The quality of ""La Cage"" is not quite as good, which is understandable, considering the age of the film.

If you enjoy foreign films, and wish to see the basis for ""The Birdcage,""  then purchase this one, as it is only a few dollars more.",1363219200,7,854,4.5064935064935066

3147191,4,B0015RRN84,"I absolutely love both movies, but the reason this is not getting 5 stars is because the Birdcage looks like crap.  I was hoping they would have converted it to a higher resolution, but imagine my surprise when I went to play it on my computer and it came up with a 600x800 resolution box.  I put it in my blu-ray player and it was grainy.  I understand the quality of La Cage, but seriously... The Birdcage was made in the 1990's, the quality should be there.",1348963200,5,460,4.264367816091954
3147192,5,B0015RRN84,"This is a great set and worth the price.
I have seen both movies before and just wanted to add them to my collection.
This DVD will not disappoint. Both are still timeless in their ability to make you laugh and are still thoroughly enjoyable.

3147193,5,B0015RRN84,These two movies are to good to be true. They are so funny. Robin Williams shines in his role as Mr. Goldman and Nathan Lane is just great!. I have seen these versions before but can honestly say they can be seen over and over again. A real treat. It's a shame that the French movie only has English subtitles and not spoken in English. Still it is wonderful to see.,1324944000,,366,4.169014084507042

The 35 year old original isn't up to ""Criterion standards"", but it's good transfer for a foreign film of it's age.
I purchased La Cage II as well. I hope someday Criterion gives La Cage I and II the treatment they deserve.
