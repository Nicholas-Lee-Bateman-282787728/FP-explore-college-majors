8355739,5,B00284T2I2,"A pianist friend suggested I look at this DVD. I had never heard of Ilya Yakushev, but after watching and listening, I'm going to be on the lookout for anything he does. In a crisply edited and well-thought-out format, Yakushev gives a powerful performance with no histrionics or other distractions. He simply sits at the piano and gives the music everything he has to give. Especially impressive is the performance of the Bach/Busoni Chaconne, as expressive and intimate as possible in some parts, and as fiery and dynamic in others.",1289174400,,534,4.944444444444445
8355740,5,B00284T2I2,"Prelude:
Pianist Ilya Yakushev is a powerhouse of a performer and this video debut, Ilya Yakushev-Live in Concert, is a stunning achievement. At last, a classical pianist who understands how to use video in the service of performance.  Far more than merely documenting a live concert, this DVD is a completely unified visual and musical creation produced and directed by this prodigiously gifted artiste/entrepreneur. The music is paramount, of course, and expressed with exquisite mastery. Yet Yakushev's dazzling display of keyboard technique is matched in quality by every detail of this production from the setting in a magnificent Baroque Cathedral to the musically sensitive video editing to the choice of program: piano masterworks of Baroque, Classical and Russian composers. Displaying mastery of both piano technique and modern technology, Yakushev realizes that virtuosity alone is insufficient, and that the musical marketplace is unkind to passive talent.  This DVD is his multidimensional calling card.

The Concert:
The legendary Smolniy Concert Hall in St. Petersburg is the setting for this concert.  While it is no longer ""officially"" a cathedral, it retains the power of sacred architecture to inspire with its vast interior grandeur.  Perhaps this is why Ilya Yakushev chose to perform from a platform directly beneath its 300 foot central dome.  He sits in a golden pool of light at a perfectly polished Hamburg Steinway.  Beyond the piano an expanse of pleated drapery vaults upward fifty feet between massive marble columns. Lit in a wash of iridescent azure, this vibrant curtain forms a brilliant backdrop for the performer's crisp ivory profile.  His black silk mandarin jacket, elegant and understated, is neither visually distracting nor physically restricting: tailored to allow complete freedom of movement.

The concert gets off to a lively start with a sparkling account of the well known Haydn Sonata in D major. The spirited outer movements provide a cheerful welcome to audience and viewers alike as we settle into this recital. The contrasting minor mode of the contemplative middle movement largo, rendered here with aching beauty, hints at  the emotional depths and explosive power soon to be unleashed.

The concert promptly continues with a completely satisfying and authoritative rendition of Tchaikovsky's Dumka spiced with Yakushev's electrifying pianism in the bravura passages. A close-up of the keyboard and the artist's hands fills the screen as he plays the melancholy Slavic folk song which opens the piece.  While nothing will ever substitute for one's physical presence at a live performance, DVD viewers will have the privilege of seeing this concert from the multiple vantage points of the video cameras deployed for this production.  One of those cameras stands unapologetically atop a tripod directly to the performer's left allowing a perfect view of Ilya Yakushev's hands and an opportunity to see what keyboard mastery actually looks like.

  Special credit must be given to the video editing in this DVD. Flashy digital tricks are thankfully absent. Close-ups, long shots, zoom effects, dissolves and other transitions are all negotiated with exquisite taste and always in support of the music.  Yakushev has achieved a new artistic synergy with this production.  The result is a concert that maintains its integrity and freshness even when viewed for a second or third time.

The Bach/Busoni Chaconne follows, serving as the concert's centerpiece.  This magnificent transcription is one of those monumental pianistic challenges which, through time, has become an acid test for virtuosity. The result is unequivocal:  Yakushev is pure gold. From quiet moments of butterfly-wing delicacy to the volcanic explosions unleashed from the belly of the Steinway, the audience will be pushed to the edge of their seats, while this performer sits in complete control at the center of his.  He plays with absolute conviction and engaged concentration from the center of the cyclone. As a pianist, Ilya Yakushev is a veritable force of nature. Avoiding both histrionic excess and aloof perfectionism, Mr. Yakushev performs with a warmth and passion equal to his intelligence and technique.

The final work on the program is reserved for one of the most popular and enduring works of the Russian Nationalist composers: Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. The opening shot of Yakushev descending the expansive marble staircase as he approaches the piano reveals again the immense interior space of the Smolniy Concert Hall.  As St. Petersburg is both the site of the concert hall and cradle of the Russian Nationalist school, the choice of ""Pictures"" is particularly apt programming, especially considering that this is where Ilya Yakushev was born, and where he trained from the age of five to become the pianist we see before us tonight. Without hesitation, he launches into the opening Promenade and, one by one, reveals this familiar collection of pictures with an authority and freshness that leaves the listener feeling he is hearing this music for the first time. There can be but one response to this performance, indeed, to this entire production: Bravo!",1261785600,5,5213,5.360294117647059
8355741,5,B00284T2I2,"""Ilya Yakushev live in Concert"" showcases the extraordinary talents of a pianist who has total command of his instrument.  Having had the privilege to experience one of Mr. Yakushev's stunning performances at NYC's prestigious Lincoln Center, I knew I had to have this DVD for my collection.  This incredible professional musician produces emotionally driven, almost mesmerizing melodies that instantly embrace audiences--capturing their imaginations and bringing them along for each musical storyline.
  Listening to Mr. Yakushev is a treat in itself, but watching his concert is the creme-de-la-creme of instrumental desserts.  This man forms a symbiotic relationship with his piano, almost as if the keys are playing with his fingers.  As his hands glide fluently across the ivory, his body dances with the feelings that each octaves simulates.  That such a man at the astoundingly early age of 27 can capture the true resonance of piano perfection, one can only foresee this rising star setting the par for future concert performances.
 Thrillingly charismatic and delightfully enigmatic, watching this DVD will leave you craving more.  Keep an eye on Mr. Yakushev by purchasing and viewing this masterpiece of ear-ecstasy.  You'll be in for a musical rendezvous with talent at its very best.",1241049600,6,1296,5.435
