8305977,5,B001GM6C3U,"This film is a sweet and endearing love story with a snarky edge. Frequent lapses into trippy dream sequences keep you guessing and offer poignant reflection.

It's definitely quirky and might take a little warming up to for some, but sit tight and you'll soon be hooked. And if you're from Hawaii, you're sure to love the inside jokes!

Fresh, funny, and highly recommended.",1377734400,,375,4.84375
