8373690,1,B002M9FXEU,"The Sonny Rollins dvd and the Oscar Peterson dvd did not play at all for me and I did not get a chance to watch it.  I did not get a chance to watch the dvd Oscar Peterson and Sonny Rollins because they did not play on the dvd player.  My dvd player was saying that the dvd Sonny Rollins and Oscar Peterson had too many scratches and the disc was not playable.  The Sonny Rollins and Oscar Peterson dvd's did not play on my different dvd's and has too many scratches and is not viewable to see at all.  I paid fully for both of then and they were delivered on time, both of them was new and wrapped up nicely when they arrived but the dvd's could not play on any of my dvd players.  I want to know If I could get a refund or replacement for the two dvd's that I most recently brought from you.
