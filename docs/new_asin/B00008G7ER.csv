7983881,5,B00008G7ER,"If I had millions of dollars...I would make this EXCELLENT series into a live action trilogy of films. One of the few animated series that made me cry.
love the retro design and the hero's and villains are to die for.",1419552000,,217,4.317073170731708
7983882,3,B00008G7ER,"I thought the ending was unfullfilling and a little confusing, and that almost killed this series for me. However, it did still have the great animation and characters, and the action scenes were epic, as well as a happy ending amongst great sacrifice, which ultimatly redeemed this volume.",1172188800,,290,5.0625
7983883,5,B00008G7ER,"This is it! The final two episodes of what is arguably the greatest comic-book-style film of them all! In the first volume battles were fought and characters were introduced, in the second characters DIED and the truth about what actually happened at Bashtarle was revealed (or was it?). Now, we get not one, but TWO showdowns between the Experts of Justice and Big Fire. THIS is where things get crazy. The final two battles are for the ages (they actually remind me of the Marvel/DC JLA/Avengers Crossover comic book), as armies of samurai, giant robots, teleportation, and heart-rending sacrifice all come into play in the last battle to stop the Eye of Volgar before the world is destroyed!

Fans of the first two volumes should be absolutely salivating for the final volume at this point, as we all just know that all the major players left alive (and maybe a few presumed dead?) will clash in a final climactic battle (or two) where all will finally be revealed. The first episode starts with Ginrei and Daisaku recovering from their desperate struggle against Genya in the last episode. From here on out, everything is really going to center around these two characters and how their decisions hold the world in the balance. Daisaku faces a struggle similar to Ginrei, as they must both decide whether or not they wish to follow the legacy of their fathers. This is particularly driven home by a VERY dramatic lecture by Murasame (who demonstrates in a shocking manner in incredible power to die and come back over and over).

This is of course followed immediately by what can only be called a ridiculously, insanely, mind-blowing battle between Big Fire and The Experts of Justice, where we get to see giant robots attack, samurai sail through the air, and some villains whose powers are so crazy they'll either have you on the edge of your seat or rolling on the floor laughing at how silly they are. The greatest example of this is the villain who can cut things in half just by snapping his fingers (Whoa!). We see him cutting down people right and left, and then he's suddenly right in front of Daisaku, about to snap his fingers. Crazy as it sounds, I was scared to death, then shocked, as Murasame stood in front of Daisaku, being sliced to ribbons over and over to shield Daisaku (if that ain't painful drama, I don't know what is). And if that wasn't enough, Ginrei then uses her power...to teleport EVERYONE away from danger (in a move that is sure to shorten her life so massively that it amounts to suicide). And then of course there was the Chief's power, a punch so incredible it could destroy everyone!

All that though, is really just a prelude to the final battle, when Genya goes after the same Shizuma power plant, Giant Robo gets a super-charge like Superman at the end of the JLA/Avengers crossover, Ginrei is fading fast and making a final decision about what to do with the final sample, and everyone is forced to decide just who and what they believe in. If you thought the battles were crazy before, you've got to see Robo's ultimate attack, and (spoiler alert) Shocking Alberto's surprise return to fight against his former allies (atop Robo no less!).

Granted, there is plenty of angst, melodrama, and agonizing over what the right thing is to do, but now (after seeing this anime several times in several languages), I really think that it only adds gravity to the fantastic battles, the confrontation between Genya and Ginrei, and the tear-jerking final, final, FINAL answer to just what will happen when the three samples and united (you will finally know if Volgar was a good or evil man!).

If you love great anime, comic books, or just a great entertaining piece of animation (and ESPECIALLY if you've been watching up to this point) you absolutely CANNOT miss the fantastic end to this epic of comic book/anime epics! Crush them now, Giant Robo!",1149033600,,3888,4.728613569321534
7983884,5,B00008G7ER,"Giant Robo took eight long years to complete. Less than one episode was released per year and from episode six to the finale in episode seven I had to wait at least a year if not more for the last VHS tape to come out. So was it worth the wait?

The third DVD combines episodes six and the long 90 minute episode seven. Episode six introduces the rest of the roster of the Magnificent Ten which included Shocking Alberto from the first two DVD's. In a strange twist the elder five members of the Magnificent Ten are forced to battle against Genya's Eye of Volger as well as Big Fire himself and his titans. So why are the villains suddenly battling against themselves and what is the true plan for Big Fire and his master strategist Komei? I've now watched two different dubbings of Giant Robo and I still can't figure out what Big Fire was attempting to accomplish.

The final DVD is a mixture of good and not so good. On the plus side the music remains stellar and the fights are brilliant. Even briefly introduced characters like Red Mask, The Fabulous Fitzkarald and Lord Doki make a lasting impression on viewers. We finally get to see the IPO heroes like Koushin and Kaei in action and it turns out they can actually fight. Unfortunately they only face off against Lord Doki's Keppu-Ren footsoldiers.

The main problem is that the plot doesn't really resolve itself. Professor Go and Chief Chujo come to the conclusion that the three anti-Shizuma samples, when brought together, will cause the extinction of all life. As Hanzui, the leader of the Magnificent Ten repeatedly asks, `What could Big Fire possibly gain from this?'. Actually Hanzui may not have known how dire the situation was but still it's unexplained as to what Big Fire hopes to gain from endless worldwide catastrophes. There's also a weird situation where it turns out that the Big Fire that the Magnificent Ten was battling may not have been the actual Big Fire. However if that's true it would mean that the Magnificent Ten ALLOWED themselves to be beaten down by a fake Big Fire who somehow managed to acquire Big Fire's titans and then fooled strategist Komei. If this sounds insanely complicated it's because it is. The last problem is the endless angst from Daisaku. He seems to drone on and on as if to pad the episode out to its full 90 minutes.

Despite its flaws I still love the Giant Robo series. There are so many memorable characters like Murasame the Immortal and Issei the Monk. Characterization is such a strong point of Giant Robo that I wish more had been made. At the end of episode 7 strategist Komei promises more to come in Operation GR but sadly no more Giant Robo OVA's were created.",1115769600,4,2683,4.5949895615866385
