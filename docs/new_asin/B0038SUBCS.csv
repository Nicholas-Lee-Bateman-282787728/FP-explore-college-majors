4092270,4,B0038SUBCS,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

I have tried other workouts by this instructor.  She is upbeat but not over the top smiley-peppy, which works for me.  I like her other weights routine and dislike her cardio workouts.  To me, weights seems to be her speciality because this is another winner.

Good cues, good mix of moves, music with good beat to follow, non-annoying backup people.  All good.  I do not have a step and was able to modify moves around it with no problem.  I got in a little cardio, not a lot, but with high enough weights it was enough to make me work up a serious sweat and feel like I got a good workout, overall.

I think the only con is that I do not care for the backdrop in this workout series --- it just seems so odd.  I find my mind wandering sometimes wondering why there is so much glass and pottery in a workout room.  The room almost looks like an oriental decor themed living room with Kelly posters hanging at odd intervals.  A very minor con but sticks out enough to mention.

I will also mention that my DVD seemed to be faulty because the mix section kept freezing up annoyingly and I ended up playing workout 1 and 2 separately.  I do not count this toward the rating since I assume this to be a random defect.",1306195200,6,1270,4.2594142259414225
4092271,5,B0038SUBCS,"If you are looking for a good weight training DVD, this is it!
I love it as well as all her other workouts...I have tried so many others and she is just down to earth with no hard routines to learn , no gadgets to learn to use, just good ol' hard workouts!",1297814400,4,256,3.849056603773585
4092272,5,B0038SUBCS,This video has been so much fun for me. I like that you can do each 30 minute workout separately or you can do the whole thing. I've started doing the whole thing to increase my muscle definition and after 2 weeks I'm starting to see a difference. I love that she doesn't just do your typical moves.,1292112000,4,299,4.172413793103448
4092273,4,B0038SUBCS,I have enjoyed this video. It is not easy to do strength training at home so I am always looking for a variety of exercise videos that will make it so I don't have to get a gym membership. I really like how Kelly does the different muscle groups and the variety in between the two main workouts. The only thing I don't like is that she doesn't do a very good job of pointing out the alternate moves if the one she is doing is too hard or difficult for a beginner. Once I have finished the workout I feel really good!,1281830400,28,516,4.019417475728155
4092274,5,B0038SUBCS,"I purchased 3 of Kelly's DVD's because I was looking for workouts for muscle building and definition. All three DVD's, including a kickboxing DVD, lived up to their claim. I appreciated the variety these DVD's included. You are able to tailor it to your needs and time. For those of you starting out, the DVD's include someone doing a modified version. My husband started to do them with me, and he proclaimed that it was a better workout than what he was getting at the gym. He was feeling it the next day. Worth it!",1279584000,25,517,4.4526315789473685
4092275,5,B0038SUBCS,"Muscle Definition is a new DVD in instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. It is sort of like a cross between an earlier DVD in this same series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Weights, and one of Kelly's older workouts, NYC: New You Coming. As with 30M2F Weights, Kelly presents full-body muscle-building and sculpting moves, putting her own unique twist on many traditional weight-lifting exercises. In 30M2F Weights, Kelly offered several different ""active rest"" options, but for this DVD, as in NYC, she uses the ""rest"" periods to focus on leg work (unlike in NYC, however, Kelly uses weights throughout for Muscle Definition, including for the lower body work). In her brief Introduction, Kelly states that she will be using 8 lbs. for shoulders and triceps and 12 lbs. for back, biceps, and chest; the DVD case additionally recommends 5 and 7 lbs. for Beginners, 7 and 10 lbs. for Intermediates, and 8 and 12 lbs. for Advanced. I generally consider myself to be intermediate, but because of Kelly's unique take on the exercises and the fact that many of the moves were a bit more dynamic, I preferred to go a little lighter than usual, sticking with my 5-lb. dumbbells for much of the workouts.

The Main Menu offers the following options:

Introduction
Workout One
Workout Two
Pre-Mixes
Individual Muscle Mixes
Abdominals
Contact
Music On/Off (not sure why you'd want to turn it off; it included fun 70s hits such as ""You Should be Dancing"" and ""Saturdays in the Park"")

One minor downside of this DVD is that both workouts are actually a bit longer than 30 minutes, something that is NOT true of the other workouts in Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Workout #1, which includes a 4.5-minute warm-up and a final stretch of just under 2 minutes, is 41 minutes long. Workout #2, which does NOT include a warm-up but does include a slightly longer (3.5 minutes) stretch, is 34.5 minutes long; if you want to go back and add the warm-up from the first workout, you'll need to select that workout from the Main Menu, go back to the Menu once the warm-up is over, and then proceed to select Workout #2. Kelly tends to perform an exercise, completing 1-2 sets; insert a lower body move as ""rest""; and then repeat the entire sequence once. Her moves are innovative: examples include a one-armed kettlebell-like swing, a one-legged deadlift/lunge combination, a ""scarecrow"" overhead raise to work the rotator cuff, a one-armed row with elbow rotation, a tricep extension performed across the body, and a chest flie with rotation towards knees. (Note: A full list of the exercises can be found on Kelly's web site.) The separate 8-minute Abdominals chapter utilizes high reps (25-50) and includes hip lifts, reverse crunch, full sit-ups, crunches, walking the legs, reclining twist, and plank with knee twist.

Also on this DVD are a number of Pre-Mixes as well as individual muscle group breakdowns. The Pre-Mixes are as follows:

Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps (58m): warm-up, two sets per body part, abs, and stretch
Chest and Back (38m): warm-up, two sets per body part, abs, and stretch
Full Body Compendium (77m): warm-up, both workouts combined, stretch
""N.Y.C. Two"" Mix (85m): warm-up, both workouts combined, abs, stretch

Two notes about the above. First, the third Pre-Mix has ""abs"" listed in its on-screen menu, but there are actually NO abs included in this mix (which is what makes it different from the fourth Pre-Mix). Second, there is no ""Lower Body Trimming"" Pre-Mix as suggested on the DVD case. There are, however, a number of Individual Muscle Mixes as described below:

All Chest Mix - 7 minutes
All Back Mix - 14 minutes
All Shoulder Mix - 10 minutes
All Leg Mix - 11 minutes
All Bicep Mix - 11 minutes
All Tricep Mix - 15 minutes

Some might not feel this is enough lower body work, but that is consistent with Kelly's style. I do think she tends to place a bit too much emphasis on the triceps, which I think is born out by the time breakdown above; this smaller muscle group shouldn't need quite as much work. Overall, however, I have few complaints about this DVD. I love Kelly's enthusiasm as well as her approach to exercise--she always seems to find ways to make the moves feel fresh, new, and varied. I have already gotten a lot of use out of her 30 Minutes to Fitness Weights DVD, and I know that I will get a lot of use out of this one as well.",1268956800,87,4387,4.748031496062992
4092276,4,B0038SUBCS,"I'm late to the Kelly Coffey-Meyer fan club, but she's awesome.  I love to work out with weights, and this is perfect for a quick workout in your living room.

I love how quickly it goes by and how motivated the instructor is, without being obnoxiously perky about it.  I am a beginner and it's working great for me.

4092286,4,B0038SUBCS,I feel there should be some breaks here and there where weights are put down and a breath or two is taken. I'm using lighter weights than shown and will see if I can build up over time. I also wish that all exercise could be done without a step.,1456704000,,245,3.92
4092287,5,B0038SUBCS,I LOVE Kelly's videos...when she says 30 minutes to fitness she's not kidding. Seriously the best workout I've done in a while. I will be buying more!,1455494400,,150,4.592592592592593
4092288,4,B0038SUBCS,"I will be purchasing more of Kelly's videos! I am a long-time classic FIRM user, but am looking for a shorter workout series, and one that has mixes. This series certainly fits the bill - it is a great value because when using the mixes, you can get more than 6 workouts from one  DVD and none of them are the same!

Downsides: I know the jacket lists beginning weight poundage, but the Intro should cover basics such as modifications, progression, how to fit these DVD's into a cohesive weekly or monthly workout plan for best results, and the body part emphasis of the main workouts. Because I am an experienced exerciser, I can figure this out for myself, but it's a bummer to have to watch the DVD first to make a plan. The Premixes tell you which body part you are targeting and how long the workouts are; I don't know why the main workouts do not. I'm sure once you do them a few times, you will know what workout you want to do  that fits in with your rotation.",1452902400,3,968,4.278688524590164

4092292,5,B0038SUBCS,Awesome workout.  I would say it is not for people new to working with weights (although workout can be slightly modified if you're willing to work through it).

I love that, as a long-time lifter, I'm learning some new moves (like the long curl bicep move, which actually got me to liking bicep work!). It moves quickly and is over before you know it. I do the bench work on a ball for added challenge. I'm a super huge fan of her heavier weight workout and would love to see more of those.",1432166400,,459,4.168539325842697

4092302,5,B0038SUBCS,"I MUST get serious about exercise again after many years... Resistance in the form of weights has actually been something I didn't dread during my planning, EXCEPT in finding a really good DVD to use.  I found it!! First, music is really important to me-I love it and it motivates me!  The music on this one is enjoyable and energizing.  Kelly really knows what she is doing and really coaches you through the entire thing.  She is pleasant, supportive and very encouraging too.  REALLY IMPORTANT-one of the ladies in the video demonstrates modifications for those of us who need an easier start!  I am confident that I will work myself into 100%, but for now, the modified version is great and easy to follow!  There are two 30 minute routines plus... I will stick with Part One for 30 minutes until I am moving at 100%, so lots here to work towards!  Step great to have for parts, but not required.  Very worthwhile investment... An amazing and powerful move in the direction of GLOWING health!!",1428710400,2,997,4.651428571428571

4092305,5,B0038SUBCS,"My most recent fitness effort has been to go through all of my workout DVDs to decide which ones to keep and which ones to get rid of. This is a DVD that I had, got rid of, and then reacquired. I decided that it's time for me to come to a final answer on this DVD. And, it's a keeper. I got rid of it orginally because I was turned off by the fact that the two workouts are longer than the usual 30 minutes for this series, 35 and 41 minutes respectively. I just couldn't fit them in back when I first got rid of the DVD. Now, however, I am doing longer workouts and I value this innovative heavier strength workout.

It is hard to classify these workouts because it's a cross between two styles - heavy strength work and innovative moves that define your muscles. Many of the moves have a twist on the traditional version of the move. I enjoy that innovation, but some will not. Also, many of the moves are compound in nature - upper body and lower body together and/or a couple of upper-body moves strungh together. The general pattern of the workout is to do a set of moves - on both sides, if necessary - and then a lower-body move to rest those muscles, and then a repeat of that first set of moves.

Kelly leads the workout with two background exercisers, including Lauren who modifies the moves. Having her modify is helpful in several spots except at the end of the workouts when they are lying on benches and she's not on screen. The music is pretty good - instrumental, but upbeat and includes some recognizable songs. I thought it fit the workouts well.

You'll need two sets of dumbbells (heavy and light) and a bench. You could do some of the prone moves on the floor, but there are a couple where it's helpful to be up off the floor at least a few inches.

Usually, I enjoy the premixes on a 30MTF DVD, but not in this case. The premixes include two parts premixes and two workouts that combine both workouts. I just do total body workouts and can't imagine doing a workout at this point that has a little over 76 minutes of material.",1427932800,7,2048,4.270618556701031

4092321,4,B0038SUBCS,"Just got the DVD last night and used it right away.  Great DVD with the exception of the volume (it was very low at first, then at some point it became louder).  Love Kelly's cueing style, very straight to the point with some humor. I'm still nursing a thumb tendonitis so I didn't use a heavy enough dumb bell (just 5-8lbs right now).  However, for biceps I did use a pair of 10lbs and today I could feel the burn. I looked quickly through the premixes, they are longer than workout #1 and workout #2 (ave 50 min instead of 30 min with workout 1 and 2). The exercise for individual muscle group is shorter than 30 min, but you'll have to do a separate warm-up first.  You'll need to get used to some of the core exercises she has in these workout, but I could tell that they will work your ab well.  Overall, for those who look to get an effective workout in ~30 min, workout #1 and #2 may be sufficient for you. If you use a heavy enough set of dumb bells, you'll sweat and feel the burn the next day.",1415232000,3,1003,4.123076923076923

4092328,4,B0038SUBCS,I like this workout. I was looking for a DVD specifically for strength training to do In between my jogging days and this was perfect. So far I'm only using 5 and 8 lbs weights but I'm still working hard as I never really focused on strength training before. However please note that she does use a stepper during some of the workout (workout 1 ) which I was not aware of prior to purchasing.,1410912000,3,392,4.24

4092332,5,B0038SUBCS,"I have many of  Kelly's 30 minutes to fitness series and I found they work well.  I find it easy to fit them in--usually do them 5 times a week--so I am happy for the shorter times.  It has helped me stick to an exercise schedule and get in better shape and lose weight. She always offers 2 solid 30 minute workouts on each DVD.  I really like this one because you really move through the exercises quickly and she packs a lot of stuff in it (see other reviews for all the details).  I've been doing this video about two weeks sprinkled in with other exercise videos.  I have been pushing myself with increasing the weights.. I have been using 8 and 10 pound weights. Sometimes I can't completely finish the second set but I know I am pushing myself with these heavier weights so it takes a bit to transition to a new weight level.  I do feel like she has motivated me to challenge myself.  I can really feel the changes in my body with this DVD. I especially can tell in my arms, shoulders and back feel.  I noticed someone else said they felt their posture improve.  I am starting to feel that as well.  Anyway, I would recommend this DVD for a challenging weight workout with a bit of cardio effect included with some of the compound moves.",1406246400,,1243,4.291845493562231

4092334,4,B0038SUBCS,"Kelly's muscle workouts are awesome. She's no nonsense, with no breaks, but you get it a full body workout done in 30 minutes.  There are usually at least 2 workout options to choose from. Funny thing about this dvd though, is that her workouts have always been exactly 30 minutes, but there's one on here that took 40 minutes. No big deal, but different for her, since her workouts are called 30 minutes to fitness. But if you want to work your muscles, these are great workouts. She does different things than just the basic stuff, so you will work out parts of your body that you may not normally. Good stuff!",1403136000,2,612,4.464285714285714
4092335,3,B0038SUBCS,"I like the exercises. love Kelly's mannerisms and direction.  but i think i started this workout before i was ready to handle the weights.  also, you need a step bench, which I have.

The focus is definitely on weights, but my heart rate gets going too. She doesn't waste a minute either. The only thing I would improve is the music as it reminded me of a John Williams score, which doesn't really do it for me when working out. Not a deal-breaker, though, by any means. If you're looking for a good weight training workout, this is a good one.",1398124800,,481,4.239130434782608

I ordered regular mail no special delivery. Now for the item itself ... what an awesome workout. There are two 30 minute workouts I do them both back to back. It's fun, well cued, and extremely addictive I love it! I feel healthy strong and powerful after doing this workout. When she does the pli and pull backs I feel so strong. Kelly is such a great instructor and she has a wonderful toned body. She also has a great sense of humor. She makes you want to keep working out even when it starts getting hard. I have sooooo many dvd workouts all of them are good, however this one tops them all.  I highly recommended this dvd.",1392508800,2,814,4.217948717948718

In this workout you are suppose to use 8 lbs and 12 lbs which for me and I have been working out for a year now was a little to much so I started  with 5 lbs and 8 lbs which I think is just fine. Works out your arms and legs really well,more arm workout then legs. The good thing about this DVD is that there are more then one 30 minute workout so you can mix it up everyday so you won't get bored to fast.

You can customize by using lighter or heavier weights. if  the exercises are a bit much  for you then just lower the weight and do less reps, until you build up to a full routine.",1375574400,4,431,3.7444444444444445

4092356,1,B0038SUBCS,I do not like Kelly Coffey-Meyer's style at all.  She never smiles and always seem to have mean look on her face like she's trying to act tough.  Her moves are jerky and looks dangerous to me....especially for someone who hasn't worked out in a while or middle-aged like me.  I returned this for a refund.,1353369600,,305,4.410714285714286

4092360,5,B0038SUBCS,"i was nicely surprised at the quality of workout here.  the production values are not expensive but i got a very nice workout on both workouts.  it also includes premixes and individual body part workouts if you so choose but i enjoy workout 1 and workout 2.  each workout exercises each body part without concentrating on abs, yet i feel that they are addressed doing the poses.
afterwards my body feels nicely burned and you also have a choice on what weight sizes you want to use.
the instructor is cheerful, explains the moves beforehand, and motivates and energizes her routines nicely.
overall,  highly recommended...i think amazon stresses gillian too much and the one video i have of hers is way too hard and sloppy in its compilations.  would like to see others featured more often.",1348617600,6,791,4.786764705882353
4092361,5,B0038SUBCS,"I purchased this DVD after I injured an ankle and was looking for a workout that had a lot of upper body emphasis.  I'd never purchased a workout by Kelly Coffey Meyers before, and I find her presentation and cues to be no-nonsense, pleasant, and very straightforward.  I've been selecting the upper body premix, and a great majority of it can be done seated in a chair, or modified for seated or bench work if you're like me and have lower body mobility concerns.  The workout is as challenging as you make it and the weight levels that you choose, but it's a very thorough upper body training session.  I quite look forward to recovering from my injury so I can incorporate the lower body sessions and get an excellent full-body workout.",1343260800,7,739,4.575757575757576
4092362,5,B0038SUBCS,"I bought this DVD so I can do weights by following someone with a simple routine.  It is exactly what I get.
Kelly Coffey is a very clear instructor with lots of energy.
There are 2 different 30 minutes workout and they are both good.  This DVD has more of the Arms and Shoulder exercises.  It is a good options for those of you starting some weights.",1336435200,2,351,4.208955223880597
4092363,5,B0038SUBCS,This dvd has outstanding exercises for the arms and legs. As a senior citizen I found this dvd to be excellent with targeted motions for those muscles that tend not to be used with a lot of the exercises. I think that this is a must have for those people who want to strip the fat and have superbly toned muscles in the thighs and arms.,1328832000,36,336,4.106060606060606
4092364,5,B0038SUBCS,"I have quite a collection of workout DVDs that I've accumulated over the years; however, this one is the ONLY one I've ever had that had such immediate results... I read all the reviews before I bought it with high expectations, and it does not disappoint.  The exercises are not ""easy"", but I didn't want ""easy"", I wanted an effective workout that would challenge me to push myself, and that would show results.  Even though it's not typical cardio, I also get a cardio workout that I can feel by my increased heart rate and amount of sweating I do.  I have issues with my feet, knees and back, so I have to be careful what kind of exercises I do.  This workout worked me without injuring me, and in fact, my back and knee problems have noticeably improved since I started using this DVD.  The muscle definition I'm getting in my arms, biceps and triceps is phenomenal and I could feel the changes after about the second workout... Overall my body feels stronger, is leaner, and my usual clothes started feeling too loose after the first week or so of working out... I can do some of the exercises with 10 lb weights, some with 7, and some with 5.  Sometimes I can do one set with a heavier weight, but will have to use a lighter weight for the second set... All that matters is that I'm pushing myself, feeling good, and getting visible results.  My body is stronger, my posture has improved, and I'm even feeling better mentally and psychologically.  I use this DVD about 3 times a week, and may do either workout #1, #2, or a combination of the individual mixes, and do non-weight exercises on the other days. Depending on how long I workout using this DVD, I might add some sit ups and push ups using my fitness ball, and always end by riding my recumbant stationary bike so that I'm working out for about 1.5 hours, up from 30 minutes about 4 weeks ago when I first started using this. Kelly inspires me to push myself, but she doesn't ""chatter"" a lot like some do on my other DVDs; she doesn't irritate me like some do either.  Something about the muscles I see developing in my arms, shoulders, back and chest that inspire me to keep at it.... Glad I invested in this DVD for sure!",1328054400,97,2189,4.398514851485149
4092365,5,B0038SUBCS,"This is another installment in Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness Series.  Muscle Definition to me is more focus on endurance or lighter weights, where 30 MTF Weights was more heavier weight focused.

This DVD contains 2 - 30 minute workouts, though both of them run a little longer than 30 minutes, not too much though.  Each workout works the total body, one muscle group at a time with some lower body work sprinkled in primarily as a rest from the upper body weight work.  Some of Kelly's workouts contain less lower body work than some of my other workouts, no complaints from me as working my legs is not my favorite thing.  Even though I need it.

Each workout starts with shoulders, then biceps, back, triceps before finishing off with chest.  You will do 2 exercises for the upper body muscle group, then a lower body exercise, then repeat the 2 exercises to finish out.

This DVD contains a lot of premixes, which gives you a lot of value for your money.  Lots of different options to make your workout shorter, longer or just work one muscle group at a time if you want.

Kelly is back with her modifier Lauren, who is always helpful.  Kelly is known to add a twist or variation to certain moves, Lauren provides a modification on the exercise in more traditional form for those who prefer it.  I personally follow Lauren quite a bit, her form is always good.

This workout is suitable for all levels, Kelly lists weights that are appropriate for each level.  Lighter weights are more appropriate for this workout, I use mostly 5 and 8 pounders, and sometimes 10's. I need to really improve my endurance and this workout is a good tool to do just that.

I like this workout a lot, I really enjoy the music and Kelly seems to be having a good time here.  She seems to be more laid back in this workout, she makes a lot of comments which make me laugh, even though I am working hard.  I enjoy that.

Overall, I give this 4.5 stars.  Highly recommended.",1326585600,22,1969,4.480337078651686
