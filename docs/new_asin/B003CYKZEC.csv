8466320,5,B003CYKZEC,"I can't say enough nice things about this little sleeper of a movie. Downtown: A Street Tale was filmed on location in Manhattan with a small budget, but a lot of love. Written, produced and starring newcomer Joey Dedio, the film concerns a group of homeless twenty somethings who are low on self esteem and confidence but desperately trying to find a place in the world to call their own. Screen Legend Genevieve Bujold shines here in the role of Aimee Levesque as a kind and compassionate social worker. Aimee goes above and beyond the call of duty to protect the young misfit runaways from the indignities of a cruel and unforgiving world and offer solutions to their complex problems. Talented actors Chad Allen and Flora Martinez also sparkle in their roles as two young lovers who can not escape from the endless nightmare of heroin addiction. Although the movie is sad at times, it does have an uplifting ending scene thanks to the fine writting of Joey Dedio and the superb acting talents of Genevieve Bujold.",1276128000,3,1017,4.751412429378531
