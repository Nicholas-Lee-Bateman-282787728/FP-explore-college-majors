8336557,5,B001QVDLKI,Bought this DVD after already using the CD for a couple of months. Love the songs! And easy to use for children's worship at church!,1254268800,,132,4.32
8336558,5,B001QVDLKI,I have all of the CDs and DVDs and the kids at my church love them.,1250467200,,67,3.25
8336559,4,B001QVDLKI,"Although I think this is a great buy overall, I have to agree with the other reviewer here in as much as these are KIDS WORSHIP DVD's. We don't want to see them performing solo tracks as that completely misses the point. I also agree about the style and fast zooms being a bit too much.

Tell the World was a much better DVD overall although even with its faults this one is still worth buying, just be ready to skip past a few bits if you are dancing with the kids!",1248393600,,466,4.065217391304348
8336560,4,B001QVDLKI,"This kids DVD is AMAZING!

Like many Hillsong items, it seems simple and too familiar at first (because they make so much stuff), but then begins to grow on you. You find a few parts that become ""favorites"" and then, suddenly you really enjoy each & every song and skit.

It is perfect for setting a fun, uplifting atmosphere for kids at home or any other environment!",1240272000,,368,4.477611940298507
8336561,5,B001QVDLKI,Once again Hillsong kid's praise and worship team showed us how to love God trough singing and dancing. My kids (5 from 4 to 12 years) love this DVD.,1237334400,,149,4.172413793103448
8336562,4,B001QVDLKI,"As happy owners of the previous DVDs (Superhero, Super Strong God, Tell the World, and Supernatural our favorite) we were eagerly anticipating this DVD but haven't found it to be in the same league as their former works.  Some songs are a tad showy, the choreography in general wasn't done as well, and the addition of four videos as part of the oft-played song-only track is more performance focused and interrupts the worship mood (especially ""All of the World"").  They would have been fine as bonus material - as our primary reason for watching these DVDs is to worship at home with our young children.  On the fast songs the quick edits and fast zooming/panning of the camera make you dizzy and are distracting.  Perhaps this DVD was more directed at older ages and may still be to your taste but it wasn't to ours.

With this said, note that there are still some very good songs and great lyrics - but we won't be buying dozens of copies of this DVD and giving it to friends with kids as gifts (as we did with Superhero and Supernatural).",1237161600,9,1043,4.526595744680851
