7826802,1,6302507200,"I agree with most everything the two reviewers (Jan. 1999 and Apr. 2004) are saying but...

Kiri may have enjoyed the recording sessions and the ""jazz lessons"" with Andre Previn but the video as a by-product is more like a souvenir for the participants.

I do not regret having spent $5.50 for the VHS; I love Kiri and I enjoyed the close-ups, but the musical value of the tape is minimal. As a jazz-CD without the video if it came on the radio I do not think I would turn around and stop to listen. Kiri, a great singer and actor, was operating at 25% of her capacity at most. I was expecting a vocal firework of jazz-singing but the selections were mostly muted and quiet.",1110326400,,674,4.341269841269841

Wonderful! As is everything the inimitable Kiri does. No, she does not sound like other jazz singers but adds the Kiri touch that has made her one of the most listened to of all performers, whether of opera or jazz. This CD made my ears very happy. I'd advised the disgruntled writer to hold on to her CD--there is only one available on the entire internet and the seller is asking for $75.00. An unmistakable message--it appears that Kiri lovers don't want to part with Kiri CDs. Also advise other viewers to get the VHS from which this CD was made. Inexpensive now but it'll not be for long. It's called Kiri & Andre: The making of Sidetracks. It has the best closeups of Kiri that I've ever seen and shows what a happy-go-lucky gal she is. Also recommend her Kiri! on VHS (her 50th Birthday Concert) It is one of the best musical recitals ever made--period. Sorry, the price is out of sight.",1082851200,,973,4.47191011235955
