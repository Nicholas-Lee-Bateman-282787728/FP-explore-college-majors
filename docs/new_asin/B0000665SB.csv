1711259,4,B0000665SB,"Technology was so close to solving these problems yet driven by their dreams they looked the other way. These inventions could never work and no one back then could tell them otherwise. You begin to feel sad and in some cases embarraced by their stupidity that they did persist with foolish ideas. The music enhances the sadness and the end scenes and music capture the entire feeling of the movie...""that dreams can come true""",1021939200,6,427,4.783783783783784
1711260,5,B0000665SB,"Great flick with some early examples of current ideas, such as buildering and parkour. The double talking voiceover, the clever use of music, and the eventual triumph of the hang glider all add up to a strangely moving experience. A DVD release would be welcome and is overdue.",1188345600,,277,4.791666666666667
1711261,5,B0000665SB,Adding my vote to see this released on DVD.  Would love to own this in a format that isn't as outdated as a motorized unicycle.,1175126400,3,127,4.08
1711262,5,B0000665SB,20/20 showed clips from this film tonight & I bet there are people hoping to purchase it as a result...looks very interesting and certainly could inspire young inventors and risk-takers alike. I'd like to see it on DVD.,1172188800,2,219,4.7894736842105265
1711263,4,B0000665SB,"GIZMO is a delightful, comedic presentation of the human spirit of determination and the willingness to take physical risks to overcome obstacles.  We certainly need more adventurers and risk takers to allow for more discoveries that surely will benefit humanity. The centuries old adage that fact is stranger than fiction is very much exemplified by the characters appearing in this film. The most bizarre fact is that this is actual footage without any actors and actresses performing the sometimes hilarious feats of human endurance.

The movie is wholesome entertainment that should bring about a laugh or two at a family gathering. It would also be a splendid tool for a motivational seminar.  As a teacher myself, I would recommend this film as instructional material for a social studies class. Laughter is sometimes the best medicine, and GIZMO might be a remedy to the streesful lives we lead!",1171411200,2,902,5.122448979591836
1711264,3,B0000665SB,"I hope that this will be released as a DVD.  It is a great movie for educators, history buffs and people interested in inventions.",1137024000,10,130,4.416666666666667
1711265,5,B0000665SB,"I wanted to see this as a kid, but I never got to until it got on cable.  That was probably the early 80's.  I loved it as a kid.  The tunes from the soundtrack are STILL clear in my head.  I am posting this here in the desperate attempt to demonstrate interest so they will release it on DVD.",1130976000,3,293,3.8333333333333335
1711266,5,B0000665SB,"This documentary composed of newsreel footage from the 30s and 40s and 50s features more laughs than most great comedies.  The subject is inventions-- the most improbable and ludicrous inventions you've ever seen.  Most are reported with great seriousness, which makes them all the more risible.

This glimpse into the past is good for all ages-- my son's watched it every year since he was 6 years old, and every year we sit down and watch it again.  Try to catch it the next time it airs on late-night cable-- and tape it!  It's not easy to find, but worth the effort.",1124668800,4,570,4.549019607843137
1711267,5,B0000665SB,"Sure, everyone knows Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, film projectors and the kinetophone and George Washington Carver came up with over three hundred uses for peanuts.  Most maybe familiar with George Eastman and his invention of dry, transparent, and flexible film and Henry Ford's assembly line process, but what about that crank next door building a time machine?  Who will recognize him?

Gizmo is a wonderful documentary about inventions of yesteryear and the perseverance of the human spirit.  Complied from old newsreel footage, director Howard Smith presents us with all kinds of interesting, strange, odd, and completely wacky inventions along with people doing extraordinary and not so extraordinary things.  Some of the best parts are the flying machines, from simple designs to really complex, intricate elaborations that you know will never get off the ground.  What I really liked is that the inventions and feats are shown not with a critical eye or in a mocking tone, but just laid before you to let you come to your own conclusions.  Another thing you'll notice is the music, as it seems to have been chosen with great care to accentuate the visuals very well.

Released in 1977, it gets shown on PBS every once in awhile, but I wish Warner would release it on DVD, as my VHS copy is showing its' age.  If you're lucky enough to see this pop up somewhere, I highly recommend it, as it's very entertaining for everyone.",1069200000,21,1442,4.901234567901234
1711268,5,B0000665SB,"At first glance Gizmo appears to be about people with foolish ideas, and silly inventions that will never work.  But as you continue to view the movie you realize it is actually about the indomitable human spirit.  In the face of skepticism and ridicule, the people in this documentary persevere.  Every failure brings a renewed effort to achieve success.  At first you think these people are crazy, but by the end of the film you find yourself thinking that your life may have been richer if you knew them, or someone like them.  These people may not have been scientific geniuses--but they are the stuff that truly makes this world worth living in--dreamers.
Over the years I have shown this film to many middle and high school classes and they loved it.  At first they think it is silly, goofy, crazy, and insane, but it doesnt take them long to realize that the people in this film have a dream and that nothing will keep them from pursuing it.
It is a film that defines the human spirit and I highly recommend it for anyone, young and old alike.",1050883200,19,1050,4.529100529100529
1711269,5,B0000665SB,"I first saw this documentary on Saturday afternoon television about 20 years ago. It was a landmark production when it came out in the 1970s and it has lost nothing over the years. Any student of historical documentaries should see 'Gizmo"".Using only archival film clips with some truly inspired original music (of all types)this beautiful piece of work manages to be both hilariously funny and fascinating. The overall message is clear i.e even the most brilliant inventions can have humble and sometimes bizarre origins. There's an element of humanity running throughout. The producers don't mock the star players - they pay tribute to them. Just a great example of the genre.",1037059200,12,678,5.117117117117117
7961620,1,B0000665SB,"Really enjoyed this years ago; the one star is because I bought this for my 91 year dad, but it turns out his video player no longer works. He would really enjoy it, but has no way to view it.  Huge Bummer.",1483833600,,206,3.9047619047619047
7961621,5,B0000665SB,This is a great movie that Warner Archive needs to please release on DVD. I remember seeing the VHS tape of this and it is a great documentary. Please release this Warner Archive.,1459814400,,179,4.454545454545454
7961622,5,B0000665SB,A fun collection of inventors and all around crazy people! Loved it!,1448496000,,68,4.75
7961623,5,B0000665SB,"This is one of the greatest films of all time.  In my library of several thousand films, I place this in the top 10.  It is so much fun, and the music is no less than great.  I've viewed this film at least 50 times and love it more each time.  I'm telling you simply, it is so much fun.  Buy this film if you can afford it as it's very expensive due to it being so rare and great.  It's never been officially released on DVD, so if you can find it, get it!",1392076800,,456,3.7473684210526317
7961624,5,B0000665SB,"But I have one problem...Come on people the year is 2013, put it on DVD so a hip generation can see and appreciate it. Who would pay $52.00 for a VHS nowadays?",1387324800,,159,4.0
7961625,5,B0000665SB,"I first saw this on PBS years ago, possibly the 80's. Being a lifelong tinkerer this movie stuck with me and i watch it often. I originally bought the VHS tape from the local station i was watching and somewhere along the line also acquired a DVD copy. Now i know Warner never released it on DVD but this one is a true retail DVD and the quality is very high but the box is in Japanese. Happy to have that one in my collection, highly recommended in any format.",1350518400,2,461,4.133333333333334
7961626,5,B0000665SB,"It is insane that this movie should be disappearing into history, because I have never laughed so hard or so long as when I first watched this brilliant compilation of humanity's misguided attempts at fame and fortune - and I laugh just as much every time I watch it on an aging VHS storebought copy. A combination of documentary footage and lilting original songs depicting the limits to which people will go to realize their dreams, Gizmo! is unique and in some ways indescribable. Well, no, it's just that this little movie is too precious to describe. It's better to search high and wide for it and at least once in your life see it and be witness to these wacky dreamers. It's perfectly innocuous, except that in the case of kids you need to make sure they won't be tempted to copy some of the insane behavior they're sure to enjoy. The phrase ""Don't try this at home!"" applies throughout.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1347408000,2,1145,5.624277456647399
7961627,4,B0000665SB,"A great inspirational movie. It is great for answering the question ""Why try?"". Unfortunately it will never be transferred to DVD or Blue Ray. So if you have a VHS copy making a personal transfer would save it not only for your self but for the future.",1307232000,2,252,4.382978723404255
7961628,5,B0000665SB,"This short film is one of my favorite movies of all time, with all flaws and odd clips.  It allows us to review some of the history of inventions from the standpoint of ""normal"" folks who have great imaginations. They fly, they try, they fail and try again!  I love the failures as much as the successes and obvious preludes to those who also have imaginations, but finally get it right.  One of my favorite parts is the tree climber.  I really love this movie and would buy it in an INSTANT if it were on DVD. I already have it on VHS and love it just as much in each viewing.  I'd also give it as gifts to my friends!  Come on, someone (legal), put it on DVD!  Then send me ordering information.",1290211200,3,697,4.156716417910448
