When I finally put two and two together and realized Michael Crawford was Woody-I loved it even more!  I totally agree that the truck turned race car is the coolest, and the guy  with the silver eye.  My friends and I have been looking for this forever!  Now we can watch it endlessly in our dorm rooms!",933984000,9,422,4.2

The quality is a bit rough as the movie is quite dated, but it's still enjoyable.

3297,5,0764005529,the problem with this film is theres no clear cut case of the villians are there really any villians in this film none that i could figure out. oliver reed s charcter krokov cant really be considered a villian primarily because theres no motive to any of what he does. from what i got out of him hes just a top russian agent with no real motive. films just a excuse to have great stunts and  a crazy plot that goes nowhere. see what you can salvage out of this one theres likeable stuff just no plot motivation.,1468368000,,511,4.214285714285714

Grew up loving this movie and i'm incredibly excited to finally own a digital copy of it!

however... I did notice that the main female role in the movie does not at all pass ""the test of time""  As a child i loved the movie. As an adult i notice that the main female role (KGB agent) is portrayed as being weak. Hard to imagine a ""top KGB agent"" as being so passive and unable to care for herself at all.",1451088000,,425,4.096385542168675

3316,3,0764005529,"Made on the heels of the success of Superman (1978) and not afraid to drop names, this is not quite a superhero film. It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.

The first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.

The film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.

Oliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.

While the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.

The animated title sequence is by Richard Williams? The DVD has no end credits.",1446422400,,1375,4.784810126582278

Forget Godfather, forget glitter, forget them all, this is the one you've been looking for.
Woody is not only a lovable and believable hero, he steals your heart. This spy/love story will keep you enthralled and captivated. At times you may start rooting for Morovich because, PORSCHE, what else do I need to say. Those 911's are the star of the movie. I rewind and watch the chase scene again and again.

3333,3,0764005529,"Let's get one thing straight: Condorman is not a great movie.  It's mindless camp, something you watch for fun, not for believability.  With that in mind, I absolutely love it.  It's one of the guilty pleasures of my childhood, when I didn't understand what made a movie ""good"" or ""bad""; I just enjoyed watching them.

I rented it the other day to show my son because I wanted him to experience the same joy that I did when I was not much older than him, and I was not disappointed: he had a great time and asked to see it again.  I just wish it were available on Netflix, but Disney's pretty stingy about what services it lets its movies be streamed on.

I enjoy the cheesy car and boat chases, with spontaneous explosions everywhere.  I love the villain, Krokov, and his over the top acting.  I wince at the inherent sexism of the ""guy rescues girl"" plot.  I laugh at the simplistic special effects of the Condorman suit, and Woody's insane audacity in confronting the entire KGB security apparatus for his Laser Lady.  It's just plain mindless fun.",1429833600,5,1051,4.5132275132275135
3334,5,0764005529,"I just got the Region 2 Disney UK DVD of Condorman in the mail today and instantly put it in the player.

I am fairly certain that I saw this in the theater and then a million times on the Disney Channel, but have not seen it since the mid 80's when I was very young.

When I started to watch, I noticed how it was similar in concept to Gotcha! (1985), with an American civilian mixed up in international intrigue. And as much as I still like Gotcha!, Condorman is the superior movie. Gotcha! is all nerdy hormones and awkwardness, while Condorman just rolls out fantastic comic book surprises one after the next.

For an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie. Barbara Carrera went on to be a Bond girl opposite Sean Connery 2 years later, and is very much a Bond girl here and Oliver Reed plays a menacing villain.

Even though The Cat From Outer Space (1978) has more than 6 actors with speaking lines, and a cast filled with recognizable stars from TV and Disney movies, Condorman is just as much fun.

The Region 2 Disney UK DVD comes with no special features. Audio options are English, French and German. With Subtitles options being English, French and German as well. The credits all come at the beginning of the movie, which was how credits were done until George Lucas changed the industry with Star Wars, so the lack of end credits seems a bit jarring. When I played this on my computer with the VLC player, there was black bars both below and on the side of the image. But in my multiregion Blu Ray player, the image wiled my widescreen TV.

Several UK sellers on Amazon are selling this for under $10 plus shipping and at that price, you can't go wrong with this DVD, if you have the ability to play other region DVDs.",1429315200,4,1924,4.375350140056023

The lead character is a nitwit, obnoxiously stupid.  Oddly enough, this is the only character played for laughs, the rest are deadly serious in their intent (none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise).  The effect is quite jarring, as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds, the piece was now a gritty spy thriller.  Unfortunately, it's never as funny as it should have been, and not serious enough to work on any other level.

Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.

Some SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.

A conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.

Woody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.

Cut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.

So, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.

Michael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a ""foolish dreamer who draws comic books"" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.

It helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...

CONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game-of-X/dp/0441273084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game of X</a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.

When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl. Where oh where can I get me some of those fun Zowie Comics?",1243123200,,5773,4.863682604272634
3442,4,0764005529,It is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It has some humorous parts too. I think it is a movie everyone could enjoy.,1222992000,,117,3.9166666666666665
3443,4,0764005529,"I remember watching an interview a few years back like ""This is your life"" with Michael Crawford, and they went through his career of TV, movies and plays etc.. and I kept waiting for them to mention Condorman, but they never did :( and they should, as it's a very underrated movie.

When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.

Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.

Seeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.

The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.

A lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.

Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features. This DVD deserves more respect then this, and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.

Oh yeah, not to forget, the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks, and includes another film with it too. And don't worry about the region stuff, they play in any old computers DVD player. So I'd recommend doing the smart thing and finding the ones still in print and pay a whole heap less then these clowns prices.

and to the person who is selling it for 500 bucks, BWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, you have a b grade movie there, not the holey grail.",1198454400,2,2615,4.300813008130081
3444,5,0764005529,"I am a little ashamed that my first review on Amazon wasn't this movie, instead I reviewed King Kong (new remake) - SHAME ON ME!!! This movie is fantastic! I remember watching it as a very young child and was mezmerized by it! It has a story, a creative concept, and a steller cast. The idea at the time was exciting because it was around the time of The Greatest American Hero and has some of the same kind of humor in it.

3447,4,0764005529,"I was in middle school when this movie came out. It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.

I had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).

The only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.

The CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.

Barbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.

The only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.

What follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history. It's all great fun and it's executed perfectly.

For high flying escapist entertainment they don't come much more downright enjoyable than this. The DVD is a disappointment with no special features to speak off except a rather slim production notes section in the inside cover booklet. It's 2 pages of notes on the making of the movie, with sections on 'The Story,' 'The Setting,' 'Gadgetry' and 'Stunts and Special Effects,' but it's all very slim pickings.

But, I've had this movie in my DVD collection for over two years and on those quiet rainy Saturday's it's a particular favorite (along with 1980s FLASH GORDON) to put in my DVD player and sit back and remember a more innocent time in my life.

3449,5,0764005529,"It was 1981... I was a poor, young man lost in a cloud of bong smoke, living in some cardboard box on the corner of 1st and Main.  I was living a lie.

Sure, the movie is targeted toward children,  but even they will notice that the wires are easily visible when Condorman  flies.

Condorman is sort of a cross  between James Bond and Batman with some Pink Panther ineptitude thrown in  for laughs.  While it is not by any means a masterpiece, it's still pretty  fun and quite worthwhile.  It's got lots of high tech spy gear, including  cool cars, speedboats, lazers and other gadgets, humor, romance, an evil  villain, and a likable hero who comes out on top.  I've read some pretty  bad reviews of the film, complaining that there's no plot to it.  I don't  know what movie they were watching, but the film makes pretty good sense to  someone willing to just listen to the dialogue.  It makes a great deal more  sense than the plots of some other spy movies I could mention...
