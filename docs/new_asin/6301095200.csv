314210,1,6301095200,"The idea for this movie is excellent.  Traveling on a stamp and the special effects.  However, I hated the boy Tommy Tricker.  He was so mean it made me not want to watch the movie.  Yes, his family is poor so he steals, but he never learns any lessons and no one helps him work things out.  His character detracts from the cool movie plot of traveling on a stamp.  Does there have to be villains in kid's movies ?????",1217376000,,418,4.1625
314211,5,6301095200,I bought this DVD for my daughter who is 25. This was her favorite movie when she was very young. We watched it EVERY time it came on! I was pleasantly surprised to find it in DVD form. I mailed it to her as a surprise and she loved it. Now her poor husband has to watch it with her almost every night. Thanks a lot  for being able to keep happy memories alive!,1172448000,4,361,3.8783783783783785
314212,5,6301095200,Like many of the other reviews i saw this when i was younger on HBO and was always excited when it happened to be on. When it came in the mail the other day i was as excited as a school boy. Im now 22 and generally don't watch kid movies anymore but this movie is still great fun to watch. I really think that this movie got me started on wanting to travel the world when i was younger. If you have kids or just enjoy kid movies this is a must for your collection. You will definitely watch it more than once.,1163289600,,509,3.9038461538461537
314213,5,6301095200,"I watched this movie as a kid - it was always my favorite, but when I got older I eventually forgot about it.  A few months ago, I re-bought the film from ebay.  I LOVE this movie.  Great for kids, it stands the test of time.  I still love this movie for it's corny storyline and the bad acting.  Though the acting isn't top notch - it is very imaginative and a great film to entertain kids.  The film features not only Rufus Wainwright, but also Celine Dion.  Great film, I absolutely would suggest anyone get this movie.  You will LOVE it and remember it forever.",1135641600,2,565,4.264150943396227
314214,5,6301095200,"When I was about 3, my grandfather taped Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller for me. I was so obsessed with the movie then that every time we went to see him, even for 10 minutes, I HAD to sit down and watch it. During elementary school, when everyone thinks everything childish is unbelievably stupid all of a sudden, I lost the obsession. I found it shoved in the back of a drawer the other day and promptly watched the movie I haven't seen in probably 10 years...and it's still as good as it was when I was 5. Albeit, it's just about the corniest movie ever, I love it. It's very indie and very childish at the same time, but it's also the type of movie that you can never forget. I found myself singing along to the I'm a-running song in the mall :) Basically, it's a hysterically funny movie, extremely cute, and only gets better with age!",1071705600,2,846,4.29375
314215,5,6301095200,"hi, brian from saskatchewan canada here,just want to let everyone out there to know about this great low budget corney canadian movie, i seen it when i was a kid and loved it ever since,i admit it is corney but that's what is good about it it is a feel good cuddley movie,very innocent would be great for kid's and family. it is about a boy that finds a magical stamp that he can shrink himself and travell around on the stamp  to different countries,lots of adventure some light comedy, you will be hooked if you just give it a chance,i did and here i am 22 years old and still watching it.",1071187200,2,591,4.230088495575221
314216,5,6301095200,"...  Anyways, years after I saw this movie it struck me that I wanted to see it again as an adult ... I watch that film at least once a year.  It makes me feel like a kid again and remind me how much I miss movies like this.  For every kid that crosses my path weither it is a relative or someone I am babysitting I make them watch the movie and I have yet to get one complaint about the movie.  2 thumbs up!",1041465600,,408,3.7093023255813953
314217,5,6301095200,"When I was younger, my brother, sister, and I always begged my mom to rent this movie -- we absolutely loved it, but my mom could never find it on video so that we could own our own copy. When we moved to Orange County when I was 10, none of the franchise video stores (Blockbuster, et al.) carried it, and the movie soon became a memory. I'm 20 years old now, and recently my mom found it here on Amazon.com and bought it for us; rewatching it was quite an experience -- all of the small details (Ralphie escaping from Tommy's house, the boy who sings ""I'm a-running,"" the sardine sandwich, Ralphie's trips to China and Australia, and the fact that you never see Charles Merriweather so that he remains an enigmatic figure) were exactly as I remembered them. For any adult, this is definitely a hokey late-'80s Canadian children's movie, but every parent should show this to their kids; I know I will. It is an original and all together delightful movie -- a must-see for anyone with an imagination, anyone who liked The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, or the book The Phantom Tollbooth.",1012089600,12,1096,4.568527918781726

314490,5,6301095200,"A true adventure story about being a kid with a less than perfect childhood.  recommended for EVERY child over 7 or 8yrs.  fantastic imagination, a look into childhood through kids eyes.  All families should see this gem. nothing like it out there.",1390867200,3,248,4.857142857142857

314492,5,6301095200,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  It was nice to buy it and have it on DVD forever.  It is a cute movie.  Just remember it is a Canadian movie from the late 80s, but its a great coming of age movies for kids.  I can't wait to have my kids watch it one day when they are born.  You will probably enjoy it even more if you collect stamps.",1368144000,3,348,3.6486486486486487

314495,5,6301095200,I loved Tommy Tricker and The Stamp Traveler! 99% because of nostalgia... but still... great flick! It is the ultimate stamp traveling film!,1329955200,2,140,5.130434782608695
314496,5,6301095200,"This movie gets referenced with my siblings probably more than any other movie we had growing up in the 80's. If you haven't seen it, give it a try. It's campy, it's funny, it's really weird at sometimes, and ever since I was a child and first saw this movie it really drove my love to visit Australia...which I did...not via stamp either. I couldn't find Mad Mike, but I almost became ""mad"" trying to find this piece of my childhood on dvd. Thanks Amazon!",1313366400,3,456,4.376470588235295
314627,5,6301095200,I loved this movie as a kid and am so glad they came out with it on DVD.  Quality is very good and the story is just as I remembered.  If only the theme song the one man band played was longer or available to buy...I love that song.  My player is even capable of listening to music and telling you what it is and couldn't find it.,1313107200,,330,3.823529411764706
314628,5,6301095200,"My mom rented this film, way back when, from the library. My siblings and I have a special place in out heart for this film. We quote it often and have used it to initiate our significant others into our family. We recently got together and watched this movie, our ages range from 32-24. The only copy we have of this movie is a VHS my mom bought from the library when the library was selling some of its stuff. After that movie night I got on Amazon a looked up the film and ordered 4 copies so we all could have one. What I want to know is where are these actors now? (The kid that sings in this movie is a pretty famous musican now)",1301529600,,635,4.0078740157480315
314629,5,6301095200,"I am 27 years old now, but I still have fond memories of watching this movie!
My mum would hire it ALL the time from the video shop and my brother, sister and I would watch it every single day!
Growing up in Australia, it was pretty cool to see Tommy and Ralph come to our country! ha ha!
Such a great movie!",1297382400,,308,3.9047619047619047
314630,2,6301095200,"I began searching for this movie a few years ago, because I loved it as a child.  Clearly nostalgia stays strong and memory fades because I had no recollection whatsoever of just how horrible this movie is.

For starters, it drags on soooo incredibly long before anything happens with the stamp traveling.  It was literally over an hour before any action happened.  Everyone in the movie seems to be an avid stamp collector- men on the streets, people in China, Australian mad men...that was so unbelievable! The plot is probably the worst out of any movie I've EVER SEEN!!!  The acting was horrible beyond belief.

Despite my nostalgia, I don't even know if I'll let my children watch this movie, for fear of insulting their intelligence.  Too bad I can't get my money back...",1293926400,,777,4.753731343283582
314631,3,6301095200,This is an older movie from my daughter's childhood.  Couldn't pass it up when I saw it was available.  Not the greatest plot however.,1291075200,2,134,4.541666666666667
314632,3,6301095200,"This is a movie that is still a lot to offer young people today. A boy travels around on postage stamps. It's magic. There's rules. It's fun. If you want to know more, watch the movie. It was one of my childrens' all time favourites and even though they're grown up, they put it on to show their friends.",1282608000,2,304,4.169491525423729
314633,5,6301095200,"My sister and I used to watch this movie when we were younger.  We found an old vhs copy not too long ago and tried to watch it again. The vhs was bad so I could only see the first few minutes.  I searched Amazon and was so excited to find it on dvd!  I bought two copies, one for me and one for my sister!  This is a great movie. The acting is a little bad, but it brings back great memories for me!!",1280880000,2,401,3.6823529411764704
314634,5,6301095200,"A treasure of a movie that seems to be cast aside by the slick, polished, schlock stock industry. It is a sweet, charming, magical tale told by actors that convey being real people. Yes it is dated in the dress, yes there is some poor acting; yes there are some corny lines; yes there are some corny contrived scenes - but the kids could be the next door neighbors.  Through the hokiness is a character believability that is endearing that makes this a great film to have in one's collection.

The subtleties of character development and subplots unfold beautifully. Ralphie and his speech impediment is clearly present, but not the main focus, and not a point of ridicule by his peers - something the stock industry would play up. Tommy Tricker, the antagonist is not so easily  and stereotypically dismissed as the ""bad"" one as his character develops. And Rufus Wainwright! At 14 is priceless. His voice at that age was phenomenal and shows so much depth. For me, this sweet movie is another example of making movies for adolescents that gets it right! Thank you independent creative film makers.",1277251200,3,1098,4.768421052631579
314635,3,6301095200,"This is a movie from my children's childhood. Now they want to share it with their children.  It was probably an afterschool special or appears to be made for television in quality, but holds great sentimental value for our family.",1237852800,2,231,4.775
314636,4,6301095200,"This little Canadian gem was unearthed by my cousins (who apparently grew up watching it and never shared the treasure with us). It is a bizarre little family film that reeks of 80s, and reeks of Canadianisms (an odor which I had previously never really smelled).

If seeing a 12-year-old Rufus Wainwright isn't enough to make you want to watch this film, please just watch it for the completely unpredictable plot, the hilariously kitschy acting, or just to get a taste of Canada (or at least 1980s Canada stereotypes...).

This film features embarrassingly short shorts, completely unnecessary educational interludes in both China and Australia, a kangaroo putting a letter in a mailbox, and a thesis that suggests every Canadian is obsessed with collecting stamps. And that's merely scratching the surface.

If you want to laugh so hard that stamps come out of your marsupial pouch, buy this unbelievably hilarious flick today.",1223856000,,930,5.145695364238411

7809902,5,6301095200,"Did you grow up in the 80s or early 90s? Did you live in Canada or Michigan and watch a lot of Canadian TV? Then you probably remember this movie and still hum Rufus Wainwright's ""Running for you"" when you're at the mall, or search for the man on the mast when looking at blue nose stamps. This is an absolute classic, and is great for hearing small children tell you how lame the stuff you liked as a kid is.",1439942400,3,409,4.061728395061729
