8089748,3,B000BNX52G,"Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer is a 1989 TV movie that has enough story and decent acting to warrant some attention. Based on Roxanne Pulitzer's 1987 autobiography, this story understandbly doesn't give much sympathy to her eventually divorced husband, Peter Pulitzer, ably played by an alternately charming and then despicable Perry King whom viewers will remember from Mandingo and the TV series Riptide. Roxanne Pulitzer is played by Chynna Phillips, daughter of Michelle and John Phillips of the Mamas and Papas musical group, who delivers a more than adequate novice performance. Also appearing is a very young looking Courtney Cox as Roxanne's sometime friend Jacquie Kimberly. The show provides glimpses of the cocaine-fueled  liaisons and the seductive jet-set lifestyles of the Palm Beach elite, but much of the movie dwells on the ugly divorce and custody battle of the once golden pair. Worth a look, but don't expect Shakespeare.",1231632000,4,938,5.337837837837838
