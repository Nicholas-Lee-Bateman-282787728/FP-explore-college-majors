8236527,4,B00101JLYE,"Breaking All Records is not an Instructional DVD on how to learn to break anything. It just shows what Team Bergamo has accomplished and can do. It is a look at their training, the competition, and most importantly, the camaraderie of Team Bergamo. They have over sixty World, National, and State Championship Titles since 2002 and holding eight World records. Team Bergamo is the dominating force in the spectacle art of breaking within the martial arts world. I enjoyed this DVD it was entertaining because it was not about fighting, katas or self defense it was about breaking things.",1383782400,,587,4.9393939393939394
8236528,1,B00101JLYE,If you want to know anything about the science of breaking or the training or how to start doing it yourself it shows you nothing. It just shows a bunch of boring breakers from some unheard of martial art school going to a breaking competition and getting trophies. Complete waste of money not even slightly entertaining in a reality show type of way. Don't buy and get ripped off.,1351468800,,381,4.536231884057971
