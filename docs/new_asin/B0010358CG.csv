3044940,2,B0010358CG,"This looks very good. The visuals are amazing on an HDTV. I am about 30 mins into the movie and I have to say that the story, acting and animation is horrible.

First the actors from the first do not lend their voices to this one.
Some of the characters seem to be different than from the first movie. The acting is pretty stiff and cliche (the tough cyborg guy is annoying).
Some of the fights are just stupid for stupids sake. I mean does Duenan and Briarious need to spin and do cartwheels while shooting? It doesn't even look cool, just stupid.

Why did they go with CGI models 100% this time? Did the old animated cells not work anymore? It sure looked a LOT better.

The events from the first movie don't even seem to play a part at all which is a shame.

I loved the first movie but I wouldn't consider this deserving of the same name. I will be selling this shortly as I regret buying it.

2 stars just because if you mute it, it looks very sharp.",1205193600,4,955,4.168478260869565
3044941,4,B0010358CG,"Back in 2004, Appleseed came stateside, after being in Japan for years. For it's time, it had great special effects alongside some of the best CGI seen. Now its 2008, and Appleseed Ex Machina is here. I must say, CGI just keeps getting better, and this is a shining example of that. Animations, facial expressions and the lip-movement when the characters are talking help bring this anime life. Since John Woo helped produce the sequel, expect to see some of his trademarks, like the doves and slow motion sequences. But they all fit into the movie perfectly. For being a sequel, I am surprised how this turned out. However, if I have to pick out one gripe, that would be the dialog. Some of the lines can get on the cheesy side. Other than that, be sure to give this a look if you've seen the original. Otherwise, if you are the least bit interested in  GCI/Anime, still give this one a chance.",1205193600,4,895,4.49079754601227
3044942,4,B0010358CG,"One of the more underdeveloped storylines from ""Appleseed"" was the relationship between Deunan Knute and her cyborg love, Briareos.

Well, ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" more than makes up for that. In fact, this CGI action flick boasts upgrades in every area -- a tighter plot, more complex conspiracies, and more lifelike animation. It's a stunning experience with loads of fiery, spinning action scenes, albeit with a slightly improbable villain.

Olympus has a new threat -- brainwashed cyborgs that are kidnapping officials, and disrupting planetary peace. During a rescue mission, Briareos is injured and hospitalized for awhile -- and Deunan introduced to her new partner Tereus -- a warrior bioroid cloned from Briareos' DNA.  She's furious, Briareos is depressed, and all three are confused by Tereus' similarities to Briareos.

But when President Athena calls an international conference, E-SWAT only narrowly stops an attack force -- of cyborgs and ordinary humans who have somehow been possessed by a mechanical goo. Their message: ""I am Halcon... all will be one."" And worst of all, Briareos is somehow being affected by the baddies, so he decides to do some investigating on his own. Now Deunan, Briareos and Tereus must join forces despite their tension, and stop a malevolent conspiracy that threatens the entire world....

While the first ""Appleseed"" movie had a rather simple plot, ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" tends toward complexity. Everything is bigger -- the conspiracies, the mad scientist stuff, the potential warfare, and even the love story. And despite its fuller plot, the sequel actually manages to cram in some quiet moments between robot battles and personal scuffles.

Director Shinji Aramaki does a pretty good job with a pretty good plot -- he unrolls it gradually, filling it with tension and horror at all the right moments. It kicks off strongly with an explosive, fire-and-darkness battle in an abandoned cathedral, and doesn't slow much down. Lots of explosive battles and zombiesque attacks, but not so many that it overwhelms the storyline.

Along the way, Aramaki drops in some very ""human"" scenes, such as a funeral and Hitomi's glammy birthday party. In fact, there are even some funny, cute moments such as Briareos and Deunan tussling over some monitoring wires in the hospital. These moments keep them acting like people.

What's the problem? Well, while Aramaki succeeds in surprising us with the main villain, it's revealed rather late in the movie, and there's never much of a motive.

But the CG animation is stunning. There's everything from mid-air shootouts to serpentine silver tentacles. Even the settlings are striking, with their Greco-futuristic marble, columns and sci-fi gadgets. And there's a breathtaking level of detail -- reflections, light, raindrops on Briareos' metal face, and tiny facial chances. Some character still have ""doll face,"" but not as much.

But this movie gets its heart from the love triangle, which is thankfully handled in a mature manner. Deunan and Briareos' loving, intense relationship gets plenty of cute moments, despite the confusion that Tereus causes them. And Tereus is a well-drawn rival, with a lot of Briareos' rough kindness, but also the insecurities of being a ""copy.""

And Aramaki particularly concentrates on Briareos' fears that Deunan will prefer a flesh-and-blood lover, and that he is gradually losing his sanity. There's an undercurrent of raw pain when he screams at Tereus, ""why do you have everything I've lost?""

""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is a worthy sequel that actually tops the preceding film -- a stunning CGI shell around a solid sci-fi/love story. Definitely worth checking out.",1205193600,14,3681,5.284246575342466
3044943,3,B0010358CG,"alright...so ive been lookin around the web and find a lot of people who have a large number of complaints about the original appleseed from 2004.  IMO, the first was AMAZING.  The voiceovers, in english and japanese were if you ask me very well done.  the animation was unique and cell shading felt like the perfect type for the movie.  The new appleseed...Ex Machina, just didn't have the same feel.  The voiceovers are by new people for both Deunan and Briarious, and honestly, if you liked the originals, i don't see why you would like these.  i began watching parts of the movie and just didn't feel satisfied with it so i skipped ahead to just see the end and understood everything that had been going on through the rest.  No filler felt needed and everything just seemed so...rushed?  My other big complaint, in the first appleseed there is a short clip (dream from Deunan's perspective) which shows a bit of Briarious and if you ask me, in this movie, his 'clone' looked far from the same.

This is all just my opinion.  I loved the first one and would reccomend either a rent or download this.  Not worth the 20 dollars and space it takes to keep.",1205107200,3,1157,4.514423076923077
3044944,4,B0010358CG,"The visuals are nothing short of stunning, especially in HD. It's worth the download just to check out how beautifully the cg animation is rendered. The action scenes are tight, with Matrix-esque slow motion shots, crazy camera angles and an emphasis on heavy gun play, indicative of producer John Woo's style. One drawback on the cg animation though is that when characters interact with each other physically it seems awkward. They don't feel like they are touching. I imagine that when you make something with animation like that you'd run into clipping issues when the characters intereact heavily. In fact, it reminded me of cut scenes from Eternal Sonata, a video game using similar animation techniques but on a bigger scale obviously.

The story is an upgrade from the first movie, although the main antagonist borrows heavily from classic Star Trek villain, the Borg. There's even a Borg like cube of sorts that serves as it's foundation. The subplot consists of a triangle between Deunan, Briareos (the main protagonists from the first movie) and Tereus, a biroid created mostly from Briareos's DNA who becomes Deunan's new partner after her lover falls in battle.

If I were to make a criticism I'd say that the main antagonist was revealed a tad too late, making the final resolution a little anti-climactic. At a runtime of about an hour and 40 minutes I felt like another 20 minutes would have been justified. When it was over, I couldn't quite believe it at first. Also, and this may be a good thing, events from the first movie go almost completely without mention. This means that you won't have to have seen the first one to appreciate this, but at the same time there is a lack of continuity for those that did.

All in all though, it's a good film and worth a watch.",1204588800,45,1786,4.754838709677419

3044997,4,B0010358CG,"This is the sequel to the original Appleseed and was directed by Shinji Aramaki too. It was released in 2007. Deunan and Briareos and is a continuation of their adventures now that they are part of the Olympus ESWAT organisation. The plot is relatively linear with a few twists along the way. One of the potential protagonists is the Prometheus corporation which doesn't qute have the menace of Genom (Bubblegum Crisis) but does a good job of being a potential villain. The film contains some dark nuances around the dangers of social media and the risk that a Utopian society can turn into a pervasive and controlling one.
The animation is glorious and the action sequences are very fast paced and exciting. There's a lot of action here. This may not be the classic that the original Appleseed was and it's no Akira in terms of plot or character development but it's a worthy sequel and a should see for any fan of Appleseed.",1419984000,3,926,4.652439024390244

The picture quality is stunning in Bluray. I had high hopes for the quality given that it's a newer movie created with modern CGI techniques and not only did this not disappoint, it completely obliterated all of my expectations. The opening scene of the Church assault is so visually impressive I've put the movie in just to watch that scene and taken it out again. It's that well done. The colors are sharp and bright when necessary and beautifully subdued in the night scenes. The neon glows are very striking and really catch the eye.

The sound quality is fantastic. I have a decent surround sound system, not top of the line by any means, and I can hear everything with crystal clear quality. Again going back to the chruch assault opening the sound of the shell casing striking the ground is so well done you can hear every time *ping* when they strike even with the concussion sounds of the bullets being fired. This is how bluray anime should be.

3045021,3,B0010358CG,"Since I watched the first movie (Appleseed), I figured I might as well watch the sequel.  Unfortunately, it impressed me even less than its predecessor.  The main character Deunan is even crabbier than in the first film.  The angst between her and her old boyfriend, bunny boy Briareos, is ratcheted up a notch with the intrusion of a Bioroid who just happens to look exactly like her old boyfriend used to before he donned the bunny looking suit.  No surprise considering it was Briareos' DNA that helped make the new and improved prototype of Bioroid soldiers, aptly named Tereus.  Of course, there's a diabolical plot a foot.  People are turned into zombies with the aid of earpieces giving them false directives.  Cyborgs are especially at risk considering they're mostly hardware and wires, doodads, and bits of bunny fluff.  It's a bit on the wacky side, with a cool floating city that looks like an upside down ziggurat.  The villain of the piece is easy to spot.  The idea of making everyone of one mind is not new or particularly fresh.  The artwork is great when it comes to backgrounds, not so much with the plastic-looking characters (Deunan literally looks like a Barbie doll).

Indeed, I've not seen the first Appleseed film, so take that into account. In that absolute sense, I'd have to regard this film as both a joy and a bore to watch. The computer animation is very good most of the time. In some places, actually, it's marvelous while in others the motion is less convincing. The urban views and shots of  flying machines are truly stupendous. On the other hand, the plot was quite predictable, and the story too often seemed to be several combat scenes strung one after the other with some dialogue in between. And though those combat scenes were often reasonably effective, I found the climactic one extremely unconvincing. The character interactions struck me as a bit stiff, even for anime, and rather monotonous. So overall my reaction is mixed -- this film is nice for the eye but less so for the brain. It depends on which organ you're more in the mood to exercise.",1358208000,,1102,4.5376884422110555

The original one seemed pretty ahead of it's time technologically and had all the stuff you would expect in a really good anime but enhanced with state of the art CGI. This new one I think is way worse that the original even though the CGI was technically better , but maybe that's because the CGI software has improved, not neccessarily because they did something better this time around. I think that because this is supposed to be anime (japanese based) and they mixed John Woo in there (chinese), the japanese chinese mix just doesn't go well together. I am not joking about that, I am asain myself but something obviously wasn't right about this movie. The whole thing seemed disjointed emotionally and visually in this movie. They should have just kept the original people who worked on the first movie to make this second one. Even the voice actors in this really troubled me, there wasn't any real emotional conntection between Briarios and Daunan this time around, I mean japanese anime is kinda wierd already but this was just weird wierd. very disappointed, but still overall a decent movie.",1356912000,,1173,4.840796019900497

3045050,4,B0010358CG,"(if you have questions...feel free and ask)
Part of the Appleseed saga of movies, games, manga, and Tv show; ""Ex Machina"" served as a worthy and spectacular addition to ""the family"". But of course, first the content stuff...

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED FOLKS...
This movie is actually a pretty clean movie. There's no nudity or situations warranting that (I'm sure that should be a clear enough statement). In fact, the clothing is much more conservative in comparison to what some of the characters from the previous CGI Appleseed wore. There are some language issues to take note of. D-word is pretty common in the early 3rd of the movie. B-word is pretty much used about 5 times from an enraged criminal trying to fight his way from arrest. F-word is used once. Violence-wise, it's not as vicious (crushed heads...literally) as the first Appleseed movie...but it's still as action packed and visually artistic as ever. Besides that, there's not much else to worry or be concerned about. Thematically, it's not as deep as the first one, but still some things worth musing and contemplating over. Teenagers and older can enjoy this.

MOVING ON...
""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is a beautifully rendered film dealing with the issues about the essence of humanity, security, love, and unity. You do not need to be familiar with every ""Appleseed"" film/manga to enjoy...not even the prequel movie. Though of course, if you are familiar, then you can glean more from it. But, they do make sure to give you good and unobtrusive flashbacks to help you understand details that newcomers to the franchise would miss. In fact, this was my first ""Appleseed"". The CG is majorly improved from the first one.  In fact, there it is vastly improved on the visual emotions factor...much more believable...if u like animation in general, that alone is captivating. If anime characters could ever exist in the real world, it would be something like this. But the animators, producers, and director do not rely on the vastly improved animation quality to carry it. Instead of focusing the audience towards the amazing wow factor of the CG, they use the graphics to subtly create a very vibrant and living world. They immerse the audience through a futuristic fantasy world that you can't help but fall in love with. From the birthday parties to walking down the street...even minor details in the scenery and social ambience was carefully and lovingly crafted. Also, the English dubs are actually very brilliant and matching to the characters...one of my favorite dubbing jobs. Also, there are tons of action sequences and they aren't just ""spun together"". They are very well crafted...and a narrative in of itself in some ways. On top of that, it's not only artistic, but strangely believable (even though some things are blatantly not reality).

Story:
As far as the story is concerned. It's not as deep as the previous movie. But that does not mean it's no less good. The tale is very cohesive and well thought out. The pacing is good...no moments where you feel like, ""get on with it!"". Every moment serves a complimentary purpose to the film. Some minor plot twists as well. Also, just like the previous film, it deals with themes. However, I will say that it's execution of them are good, but nothing that will ""raise the bar"". Still, I loved the overall narrative and the way it was executed...and still good lessons to learn from it. Also, the allusions to Greek mythology really adds so much to it...though subtly.

There are some fun special features as well. They include a documentary about the teaming up of John Woo (a Hong Kong action movie legend) and Shinji Aramaki (an anime power house) for this project, another documentary about the advances in animation & dubbing process that helped bring more life to the film...that was my favorite special (very eye-opening and you garner much more respect for the people who worked on it), and the usual filmmaker's commentary. Good and fun stuff.

ALL IN ALL
""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is a beautifully rendered film taking place in a very engaging and immersive world. It's not particularly profound, but it's not completely without meat. An excellent lighter experience mixed with good storytelling and vibrant visuals. Definitely worth a shot.",1332460800,,4282,4.948539638386648

3045052,5,B0010358CG,"Now for most of the people who know me, I'm a shooter gamer buff. I like my guns, mecha, and just blowing stuff up and taking names. That said sometimes there WILL be a non-gaming media hit that catches my eye, probably because it's pretty much shooter gamer buff stuff in anime form. This recent sometime would be Appleseed: Ex Machina, where there are guns mecha, just blowing stuff up, and taking names, in anime form.

The movie starts off with ""who are these people?"" for the first ten minutes, that and the art style takes about that much time getting used to. The cel-shaded, oozing anime-style is obvious as some people mentioned before, the graphics seem like an up-scaled japanese game. After the opening scene ends and you're eyes adapt to the style, there is nothing but action really here on out. The characters don't take long to get used to and like, and if you're an Action/Romance buff like me who is a sucker for stuff like Robotech, there is plenty of low-key mushy stuff to mellow you out between the action-packed sequences.

The character design is a masterpiece, and like most anime buffs like me, you'll get your healthy dose of buff dudes, hot chicks, and cheesy but also relatable dialogue. That said, I was somewhat amazed that they were able to sneak in an F-bomb in this PG-13 title, but the scene with it is quite short. Also with that said the story is almost edging on Star Trek themes, to which I'm not going to spoil that point for you. Obviously they gave the movie universal Sci-fi appeal for the cautious westerners who may be put off with the anime design.

With that said, I found the movie a blast with my perfect mix of Action/Romance, Anime, and Cool/Attractive characters that I think was money beyond well spent. I see me definitely watching this movie multiple times and add to my personal Robotech collection.

In my opinion?

Quality on a whole other level. Almost an instant choice in my list of top three blu-ray. That would include these 2 and Avatar. Stand alone, exceptional, and one of a kind experience. These are the blu-ray that make blu-ray!!!

After the original ""Appleseed"" gained popularity from maybe a cult level, the sequel was long-awaited. The film makers must have known the original was incredibly designed on every level. What was already made was put to the most cutting edge computer animation resources for this second film.

As a sequel I will assume many will know about the story elements. I will simply say that that this is a well connected continuation. At the time of it's release a third was planned, apparently dropped but not absolutely sure. You can be sure this is good in every way.

3045065,4,B0010358CG,"Appleseed Ex Machina is the sequel to the 2004 Appleseed film that was directed by Shinji Aramaki.  It continues the story of Deunan and Briareos, and also introduces a couple of new characters (Tereus and Aeacus).

The languages menu for the Appleseed Ex Machina DVD is a little on the frustrating side.  It is done in such a way that the language option for each country is written in that respective country's language.  Unfortunately, this means that the Japanese and Chinese options are written with the Japanese and Chinese characters.  If you want to choose either of those as a language option, you have to have some familiarity with the written characters.  Also, after you choose the language, you are automatically returned to the main menu.  In order to indicate that you want subtitles, you have to return to the languages menu and choose the subtitles.

The regular release of Appleseed Ex Machina also has two short documentaries on it.  The first is ""Team Up: John Woo and Shinji Aramaki.""  This runs for about sixteen and a half minutes, and through interviews with Shinji Aramaki, crew members, and anime journalists, you find out what each of these individuals brought to Appleseed Ex Machina.  The other documentary is ""Revolution: Animating Ex Machina.""  This runs for about eighteen and a half minutes, and it talks about how the animation was done for the film, and it also delves a little bit into the English dubbing for the project.  The trailers feature only includes two anime-related trailers (both of which are for the live-action version of Speed Racer).  There is also an audio commentary.

There was also a two-disc special edition version released for Appleseed Ex Machina.  The second disc includes two documentaries.  The first is ""The Appleseed Chronicles.""  It runs for about twenty minutes, and goes into the history of the Appleseed manga.  Personally, I was a little disappointed that this feature never touched on the 1988 OVA version of Appleseed or the 2004 Appleseed film directed by Shinji Aramaki.  The other documentary is ""East Meets West,"" and it runs for about eighteen and a half minutes.  This feature talks about how anime crossed over into the west, and how various terms and ideas involved with anime have been cross-pollinated between the Japanese and American cultures.

In my opinion, Appleseed Ex Machina was a strong follow-up to the Appleseed film.  The computer animation used in this film is even better than in the first film, and there are some shots and sequences where you truly feel like you're watching a live-action film.

Appleseed Ex Machina is a PG-13 rated film.  It's a violent film, so I really wouldn't recommend it for young children.  However, if you're a fan of the first Appleseed movie, you won't be disappointed by Appleseed Ex Machina.

Personally I don't have any complaints except one scene where a part of the character Brearios's head clips through his body a little when he is laying in a hospital bed, it was the only serious visual flaw I noticed during the whole movie.",1234396800,,747,4.628787878787879

No, I've not read the manga. No, I've not seen the original Appleseed OAV, but yes I have seen the first Appleseed movie made in '04, and yes it's been a while and I don't remember much. Regarding Ex Machina, however, I got what I expected after hearing John Woo was attached -- an action movie. The plot reminded me of so many other stories that tried to illustrate humanity's over-reliance on technology and how it almost led to their own downfall. But where something like an I, Robot or WALL*E succeeded, Ex Machina faltered by diverting too much attention to art, animation, and action sequences instead of a consistent plot or even a little more characterization, which resulted in a somewhat underwhelming feature. Granted, I, Robot was more of an action/thriller than drama, but even with a few more minutes in run time, it managed to tell a similar story much more effectively. In Ex Machina, I felt there were a lot of little things crammed in such as the interactions between Deunan and Briarios, Briarios' conflict with seeing himself in Tereus, or even Deunan seeing Briarios in Tereus. I felt it tried so hard to establish the characters in such a short amount of time that it ended up losing presence to concentrate on the message or at least tell it in a more poignant narrative. Regardless, though, the actions sequences definitely have that John Woo-ness to them. So if anything, this could probably equate to a decent summer blockbuster if ever produced and cast well enough by Hollywood.

Video - 4.5

As perfect as CG should be on a BD, I'm actually not sure if this was a perfect transfer. Colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness are all pretty sleek on the very intricate character designs and backgrounds, but I could've sworn I noticed maybe 2 or 3 instances of macroblocking within the very thin lines of some characters. It may have just been some kind of light transition from a dialogue part to an action sequence (one particular scene kinda' lit everything up), or it could be that disregarding a large majority of the fluid animation, the crew may have actually slipped up. Other than those minor flaws, though, Ex Machina would probably make for a reasonable demo choice if you wanted to show off something animated not by Pixar. As stated before, the gunfight/action sequences are pretty cool to watch.

Audio - 3.5

As typical of Warner, they decided this was a less than worthy title to give any lossless audio to. And while the regular Dolby Digital 5.1 Japanese track (I hate ADV, so no I don't care about the dub) did enough, I can't help but wonder how much better it COULD'VE sounded had it been bumped up a notch to a Dolby TrueHD encode. Directionality and dialogue are pretty good for what it's worth in the front sound stage, but I felt the surround channels were vastly underutilized, especially given the bombastic action and gunfire scenes that definitely would've given this entire feature that extra oomph. But for whatever reason, Warner, even with a 50GB disc, didn't feel the need to do it. Idiots.

Extras - 4.5

I actually watched the special features before even watching the movie because I was eating dinner and am not very adept when it comes to grabbing food while reading subtitles. But I have to say that thanks to that, I actually enjoyed the film a little more than I might have initially. All extras are presented in HD and cover various topics ranging from the atypical production notes to the history and study of Masamune Shirow and the Appleseed franchise to even some cultural factoids and observations about Japan, anime fandom, and its carryover/reception into the U.S. Being an anime fan since I was around 10, but being out of the loop for a little over half a year, I found it to be refreshingly informative to see these people discuss the cultural phenomenon that most Americans are probably alien to. It was a good watch for the new, old, and uninformed, giving great perspective on the whole thing.

Overall - 4.0

Appleseed: Ex Machina had the right concept going, but as most anime movie features go, there just wasn't enough time for everything. I can respect movies that are supposed to be a straight dose of whatever their intended genre like actioners (Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, or Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture), mind trips (anything by Satoshi Kon), or dramas (anything by Makoto Shinkai). However, you get the feeling some times that a movie can be so much more. Unfortunately for Ex Machina, while full of some great action sequences, it was short on a good screenplay, concentrating a little too much on subtle character interactions and less on the themes and story at hand. If you can get past that, though, the rest of the disc is good enough for a recommendation",1233273600,,4785,4.73469387755102

The movie honestly is a pleasure to watch, but please note that to get the best effect you should purchase the Blu-Ray version, otherwise the score goes from A+ to about a B- since it stacks up against any average animation.  My first mistake was getting it via ""Video On Demand"" and what a terrible mistake that was.  Watching it in HD made all the difference.

However, the writing and acting was very disappointing as it reminded me of some of the things I used to read from my friends in Junior High School.  It's really at that level in my opinion.

3045082,4,B0010358CG,"Only the action is over the top.  But it's 'just' a cartoon, so that's OK, right?

Visually, ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is overwhelming in detail, design, and in the illusion of camera movement.  The city scapes are so detailed you'd think they were rendered from photos of real urban environments.  Textures of fabric and surfaces are incredible, only a small step from photo realistic.  Only human skin is visibly simplified, consistant with the anim aesthetic.  The opening sequence was set in what appeared to be the cathedral in Koln, Germany, down to the gothic detailing in the buttresses and the stained-glass windows, except you'd never be able to film that kind of action there.  The sci-fi gadgets were equally well done, mostly with a very plausible and appropriate feel.  Pulling in Prada to design costumes for the animation was innovative, and added another layer of depth to the cartoon.

Yeah, the action was over the top.  Noted.  It was no more extreme than 'Matrix', despite having less limits than a photography type movie.  Still, it was appropriate to the medium and plot.

The complexity of the story, the relationships, the character flaws, and depth of the characters pushes out of the Saturday morning league, and past the level of many conventional films.  There is a mixture of flaws, tensions, caring, and bravado entirely fitting the story, but well done.  In the story, there are several layers from a chaste romance between colleagues, questions of trust and loyalty at many levels, to international power games.

I don't normally hold anim in high esteem, but ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" exceeded all expectations.

3045085,2,B0010358CG,"I've never been a huge fan of John Woo. I think Hard Boiled (1992) is one of the greatest action films ever made, and I liked The Killer (1989), A Better Tomorrow (1986), and Bullet In the Head (1990), but we need to be honest with ourselves and recognize that this guy sold his soul to Hollywood in the mid-1990s and hasn't made a great film since 1992.

He has, however, completely destroyed a sequel to one of the best American movies of recent memory (Mission Impossible) by over-Hollywoodizing a uniquely non-Hollywood film made by Hollywood. That's quite an ironic feat that he should be particularly ashamed of. Now we have Appleseed: Ex Machina (2007) to add to the list of Woo-ish debacles over the past 16 years.

This sequel to the exceptional anime drops the ball in a number of respects, yet still proves to be a marginally entertaining movie. The most obvious fault is that numerous events are near copies of science fiction movies from the West, thus making this endeavor much too conventional for a Japanese anime. In addition, the storyline wasn't as well-conceived as the original. Luckily, this movie has just enough positives to earn a watch. The protagonists are very likable characters, the plot is engaging, and the visuals are very good. The action scenes don't reach the levels of exoticism or quality of the original, but they are still moderately entertaining. In the end this is a very flawed picture that will only satisfy anime action junkies that can look around some mediocre elements.

Now, there were some very specific Woo-ish aspects that really annoyed me. First and foremost are the doves. Yes, there are heaping amounts of flying doves in this Japanese anime film! Why the hell is John Woo so obsessed with doves? Yeah, they provide some ironic symbolism during action scenes, but using them to the degree that he does I have no doubts that he touches himself to pictures of doves when he's alone at night. And the fact that he uses these little birdies in almost every one of his movies proves to be almost as annoying as Rob Zombie's habitual use of white trash folk in his movies. Yes, it's that annoying.

But wait. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions regarding just how much influence Woo had in this watchable (yet severely disappointing) sequel. So I fired up the Special Features option on the DVD menu and watched the 16-minute ""Making Of"" featurette that focuses specifically on John Woo's influence as a producer. It provided some much needed information regarding just how far this has-been shell of a director has fallen. Let me run down some of the statements made by the Japanese director and producers of this film:

""This is the first time a big time Hollywood director has tried to tackle Japanese Anime.""

So Woo isn't even recognized as a director of Chinese cinema anymore. How quaint. No one in this ""Making Of"" feature even mentioned his Chinese filmography.

""Japanese producers wanted to expand into the Western market and saw that working with John Woo would be a good match.""

Nice. If your name is dropped by someone as the foremost expert in Hollywoodization, would you really take that as a compliment? Man, this guy has really hit rock bottom.

""John brought his years of experience in Hollywood to it.""

Well, he certainly brought all of the negatives of Hollywood cinema to this production. That was obvious from watching the movie. How many times do you see a Japanese Anime film copy scenes from I Robot and The Matrix Revolutions? Yes, it's really, really pathetic.

The most enlightening statement was with regards to the preliminary Japanese storyboards.

""John took a look at it and came up with some really great notes.""

What was particularly hilarious about this statement is that on-screen you see John Woo's head shaking in a disapproving, almost disgusted manner while watching the initial storyboards. It's almost like he's saying to himself, ""This is way too Japanese for an American audience. We need more slow-mo shots and conventional elements to reach a wider audience and make more money."" Nice job Johnny boy.

Director Shinji Aramaki apparently conceived Ex Machina to be nothing more than a tribute to Woo's work. He says:

""We devised the Cathedral scene before John showed up to pay homage to his work.""

It's really too bad that Aramaki was so accommodating to implementing all of Woo's ideas into the film. It effectively crippled a movie that should have been as good as the original.

I hate to say it, but John Woo is a no-talent has-been who has only harmed the international film industry since making Hard Boiled in 1992. I have no problems with him making tripe in America. Heck, that's what American cinema is for. But don't you DARE to take your new-found money-grubbing mediocrity to Japanese anime - one of the most unconventional genres of cinema in the world today.

Someone needs to stop this guy before he attempts to wreck another Asian movie.",1219190400,4,4954,4.8288075560802834

John Woo and Shinji Aramaki's futuristic tale of cyborgs, bioroids, and humans spotlights the E.S.W.A.T. force of Olympus, a post-apocalyptic city.

Governments from around the world are about to join in a massive satellite-sharing operation. Terrorists attack from unexpected directions, causing turmoil in the city. The core of the E.S.W.A.T. team faces not only their biggest mission, but their most intimate challenge ever. Deunan, a hard-charging human, Briareos, her cyborg partner and love interest, and Tereus, the bioroid fashioned from Briareos's DNA must overcome excruciating obstacles to ensure the peace and safety of not only Olympus, but the world.

The motion-capture technology used for this film is much improved from earlier incarnations. Characters' body movements were the most natural I've seen so far. Unfortunately, the animation style felt far more appropriate to a gaming environment than a movie. My fingers got twitchy in expectation of game play that, of course, never happened. This blended animation style continually pulled me from the story so I could check out where they splurged or skimped on detail (ie: fine facial movements verses chunky locks of hair).

As to the story, I found the love triangle an interesting byplay to the larger situation. A conflicted Deunan deals with two versions of the same man. Set within the bigger frame of a terrifying social meltdown, this emotional situation adds tension to an already difficult day.

For the most part, the story was believable. Certain elements were predictable, but they were presented in a manner that will leave anime fans satisfied.

Hardcore fans might find this film a bit off the pace at times, but, overall, it'll be a fun title to add to your collection.

nothing like the ""ghost in the shell"" series.

the height of this silliness was when our hero pouted, jumped up and down and left the party almost hysterically like a distressed school girl when she found out she had to stick to her new partner even though her old ""broken"" one (not so delicately suggested as her lover) was up and running again. a depiction of extreme unprofessionalism, assuming that she has the right to be outraged for such a personal reason, while sadly implying at the same time that larger matters related to her professional role and mission are secondary in her list of priorities, suggesting a rather unpleasant little girl as the centre of our story. a lot of other scenes could have been made more elegantly, but this one is by far the worst. the lover / combat partner dynamic was clumsily done and the whole thing came across awkward and embarrassing.

one wonders how psychological research had progressed in the era of the story, when being emotionally entangled with the person you partner up with in an extremely high stress profession like our heroes here, was never considered as problematic. adding to that is the fact that our hero is said to be a highly trained ESWAT soldier by the time she was 12 years old, further indicating that specialization in combat that came at the expense of emotional maturity was tolerated by design in this futuristic world where information is king and abstraction of realities is something you have to grasp without blinking a eye. yeah right. i suppose of one is blown to pieces, one can always replace one's mortal body with a robot, so lack of emotional control in a combatant is OK.

the logic of the story continues to deteriorate when our girl hero was given a biological copy of her lover/partner to replace his broken machine version, which in turn was created to replace his dead body.

along with some behavioral sciences, some of the old political system seem to have broken down too. is olympus a democracy? how come national decisions were made by the two women rulers alone?

This obviously isn't the first story to tackle the subject, but it does so very ably.

The story, while not what I would call ""amazing"", is good, and is a little less ""Japanese"" in that there is a more clearly defined ""good"" and ""evil"" - so it's more palatable for those not familiar with hard-core Anime (i.e. most American viewers).

A minor point.  This version is more CGI looking than Anime looking, but everything moves great.

3045121,4,B0010358CG,"Appleseed Ex Machina is the third movie in the series.  As the movies have been substantially spread apart in their realease dates, there are substantial differences in animation between them.  The second movie was a huge step up from the first, melding cinematic graphics with excellent animations.  Ex Machina takes it yet a step further:  cinematic graphics are used exclusively, with no animation.  At first I didn't think I'd care for it as much, but the characters have been infused with an even further level of development through the plot and scripting.  I was also pleased to find that the annoyance level was turned down (i.e. main character didn't yell out 'Briarios' name 300 times through the movie).  All in all, I felt this movie was a worthy installment in the Appleseed series.  Here's a brief breakdown of the movie for ease of reading....

-Graphics/Animation:  Top notch, character realism nearly rivals that of FF Advent Children.
-Music:  Heavy hitting techno tunes for the action sequences; quite pleasing
-Scripting/Voices:  Admirable job on voices and scripting, no complaints
-Plot/Character Development:  Great focus on main characters, although almost to the point of making the plot a bit hazy.  If you liked GITS storyline concepts, you'll definitely like this one; very in depth.",1210464000,2,1311,5.2105263157894735

The previous film though, was much better written and a lot less predictable.  Ex Machina has distinct story holes and an overly-contrived setup that makes the whole thing seem forced.  Story that should have been more developed wasn't and plot that should have been trimmed was needlessly stretched.

I enjoyed the art, as I usually do with Shirow's work, and the voice acting wasn't bad either, but don't expect a brilliant screenplay.  With the right expectations it's enjoyable for most any Otaku.",1209945600,,628,5.048543689320389
3045124,5,B0010358CG,"It seems that people either love or hate this revived anime franchise.  I for one, find myself drawn into its post-apocalyptic world of technological marvels and complex political struggles.  The emotional side of this film is much more developed than in the previous installment.  The characters' personalities and flaws are explored on a deeper and more satisfying level.  But not to worry fellow action buffs, there are still plenty of genre-defining fight sequences that take full advantage of the innovative computer assisted graphics.  The influence of the inclusion of legendary director John Woo on the project makes itself apparent in scenes of gun-slinging glory.  Anime fans, show this one to your non-believer friends for a sure convert.  The attention to detail and sophisticated graphic rendering should help displace that ""cartoons-are-for-kids"" mentality.

3045125,2,B0010358CG,"This would've made an *excellent* shooter/RPG. The CGI is almost identical to what you see in good video games these days, and the music is on about that level.  The settings would've made for great game battles.  As a movie... well, let me give you the good and the bad:

The Good:
*Getting to see Deunan and Briareos fight as a team.  On their own, they're incredible.  Working together, they're devastating.  These two could take out half an army on their own.

* The fight scenes in general are slick and polished, at times reminiscent of ""Equilibrium"" and ""The Matrix"".

*The settings:  We're shown a bit more of Olympus, and it's high-tech, without being overwhelming.  Battle sites are appropriately menacing and--what I especially liked--flying debris/shrapnel posed an actual threat to the characters fighting, a degree of realism most anime, CGI, or even live action movies gloss over except when the plot calls for it.

*THe comraderie between the ESWAT members.  You really got the feeling they were a team *and* a dedicated branch of law enforcement.

*Glimpses of the world outside of Olympus.  Where the first movie gave us just a glimpse of the Badlands, here we had references to and characters from Poseidon.

*Bioroids acting like...well, Bioroids, as opposed to escapees from 'The Stepford Wives'.

The Bad

*The changes in voice actors.  I'm with pretty much everyone else on this.  This movie would've been better if they'd kept as much of the old English-speaking cast.  There are many familiar (to anime fans) voices in this movie, but they don't mesh well with memories of previous movies.  I especially missed Jamieson Price as Briareos.

*Changes in character design:  Athena and Nike are recognizeable only by their hair color and name.  Even Deunan's eye color looked different.  Many of the characters looked more like rubbery 'posable dolls', or wax figures.  (Especially that close-up of Deunan at the party.  She reminded me of a Barbie doll.)

*The music.  I can't say much about it, as none of it made any kind of impact on me.  It was background noise, nothing more.  It didn't even help set the mood (aside from one awful attempt at choral music at a critical moment that failed badly).

*Failure to develop current plots, much less include anything from before.
The introduction of Tereus looked promising, but they did almost nothing with him.  He looked like and often acted like Briareos, but there was no development beyond a single uncomfortable moment between himself and Deunan in a resturant.  Briareos's later outburst seemed to come out of nowhere, as there'd been no interaction between Deunan and Tereus to warrant it.  (That he'd witnessed, anyway.)  Tereus is supposed to have 'taken a shine' to Deunan, but it wasn't portrayed very well at all.  I saw very little that couldn't be called concerned professionalism.

Tereus himself was lackluster, his sole contribution to the story was that he looked like the original Briareos.  They could have used this opportunity to explore the ethics of the proposed addition to Bioroids to ESWAT, and what problems their emotional inhibitions might bring.  There could have been an opportunity for debate over the ethics of using genetic material from still-living people to create Bioroids.  (And what happened to 'all Bioroids have some of Karl's DNA in them'?)

Even more disappointing, the key element from the second movie, the result of the Appleseed data, is non-existant.  They're still growing Bioroids in vats.  While the changes in the appearance of Olympus could have easily been explained away by the fighting in the previous movie, it then makes no sense to ignore that key plot point.

Instead, we got a weak political plot, an enemy whose motivations made little sense, and a see-through conspiracy.

Overall, I can't call this a bad movie, but it's a better rental than a permanent addition to your collection, unless you are a die-hard Appleseed fan.",1209772800,7,3961,5.006134969325154

The whole ""being posessed"" idea has been done too many times before and seemed like an easy way out when it came to creating the plot for this movie.  The main character says Riorios so many times they should have put a count at the bottom of the screen.

  Long moments without any action",1208736000,,505,4.544444444444444
3045132,4,B0010358CG,"The Good:
The story was really interesting, the idea of a PDA that directly interfaces with the brain being used by a malevolent AI to control people was pretty clever, and though a little predictable, the ""twist"" at the end was nicely done. What was also pretty intriguing was the concept of what makes us who we are: Deunan experienced some truly odd feelings when she discovered that her partner, a cyborg named Briareos, had been cloned while laid out in the hospital, and the resulting Bioroid would be her new partner while Briareos was recovering. This new clone looked like and acted like her original partner before he became a cyborg, and he retained some of his knowledge of their relationship. It made for some wonderful moments of WTF. The body animation was motion captured well, and for the most part worked. What was truly amazing was the environment- The art direction and modeling on this show was spectacular, from the city sprawl and it's enormous layout, all the way down to the Landmates and their intricate detailing- utterly mind blowing.

The Bad:
The movie went along pretty smoothly until the end. Unfortunately, the third act played more like a video game than a film, complete with a floating anti-gravity fortress built with the idea of easy access, squad members who are pretty disposable and the neverending stream of bad guys who come out of an undisclosed location. If the staging weren't as good as it was, this stereotypical gamer battle might sink the film. Once again, facial animation was terrible. Also, the cleanup on the hands was pretty weak, making them feel like dead things on the end of their arms. And some of the motion captured animation made the characters jitter in the non-action segments of the piece, most noticeably during Deunans tour of the Bioroid facility and during the party. The general look of the characters was also out of place, a weird hybrid of standard cartoon anime with detailed texture maps. It gave off a vibe that the directors couldn't decide whether they wanted hyper-real or straight up cartoon, and I wish they had made a decision one way or another.

The Summary:
The movie was great. The positives outweigh the negatives enough to make it throughly awesome to watch, and because of the art direction and character development, the movie felt like it was part of a real world. Though I wish they had made some different decisions with regards to animation and the unrealistic boss battle at the end of the film, the story was strong enough to stand on its own.",1208736000,,2540,4.783599088838269

The studio did the best they could to sustain its original quality with carefully perform-

and I understand that some of the viewers commented how much they were dis-
appointed to find out the change.  Still, I was really impressed with those American/
Canadian engineers and voice actors' greate efforts and cares that had been poured
on to produce the English version, watching the surplimental materials.)

One thing that I could ask for was a documentary or commentary that showed or intro-
duced the behind-the-scene producton notes or materials, following/retracing the movie

3045136,5,B0010358CG,"Wow, I have got to come down hard on the side that believes this is better than the (2004?) remake.

My history with this series goes back to the late 80's when the Manga came over to the USA, and then the original OVA joined from Japan. These two remakes/reimagings are quite different from the original but carry the spirit and philosophical ponderings of Masamune Shirow with them as well.

My thoughts: Appleseed (remake), the predecessor to Ex Machina had some stunning visuals however the combination of 2D and 3D art did not mesh for me. I had to get used to the downplay of philosophical/racial/political questioning which took a back seat to the action. The overall ""scope"" of the story seemed to have been collapsed.

Ex Machina (The DVD here) brought back the original's heady themes, uses a cohesive art style, and has the best characterizations of the three main characters (one of which is new). We don't quite get enough of a view into their lives, but their relationships with each other are nicely developed. This will hopefully lead to a nice continuation in the third movie.

For those who like to have something to think about, the politics are amped up in this installment and feel quite contemporary with current security states and the modern shifting boundaries between freedom in society and security.

For those who like action, there is plenty as well, including (fashionably?) zombie-likes, John Woo influenced choreography and Matrix-inspired scenes.

I highly recommend this DVD, and that means something coming from this jaded Anime and Manga fan. I can't wait for the next installment.

A side note: there is lots of shooting, but virtually no blood or gore and the language steers clear from offensiveness and foul words in the English dub. Even the dub is one of the better-quality dubs I've come across though I always recommend rewatching with the original Japanese language track and English subtitles.

5 stars from me, and hopefully not exaggerated due to my disappointment of the previous remake. I feel this is a worthy successor to the original story from the late 80's.",1208217600,2,2112,4.929577464788732

3045140,4,B0010358CG,"The first Appleseed film (from 2004) was quite a treat.  The cell-shaded CG graphics looked very good for the time.  Complementing this obvious standout aspect was an intriguing story and an excellent soundtrack.  It's worth noting that the story, in particular, felt like a genuinely original re-animation of sci-fi concepts.

Fast forward to today and we have the sequel, Ex Machina.  It's pretty simple to separate what works and doesn't in Machina:

GRAPHICS:
The level of detail in the graphics has improved dramatically, and characters look less like geometric objects with textures painted on and more like genuine people.  The cityscapes are even more impressive.  Furthermore, the action is more frequent and looks even slicker.

My two gripes with the visuals are these: First, in what is all too common in action movies like this, the best scene is the first one.  Hands down.  I don't understand why so many directors feel the need to frontload their movies.  I will say that the movie is less guilty of this than its predecessor.  Second, movement outside of action scenes still looks a bit jerky.  Some might fault mo-cap technology, but for my money, Final Fantasy: Advent Children boasted some mighty believable movement.

STORY/WRITING:
Here's where Ex Machina falls apart.  The story here isn't anything you haven't seen executed better in anime/other entertainment.  Compared to the plot of the first movie- which created a unique sci-fi framework, this one felt like a filler episode.  The villain was cliche, the story far less complex/meaningful than the first, and any intrigue or mystery the story might yet have held was ruined by the horrible writing.  The film tasks itself with letting the viewer in on a number of concepts necessary to the plot, but rather than integrate them seamlessly into the dialog, it bashes the viewer over the head with them.

MUSIC:
The soundtrack wasn't bad- I just didn't notice it most of the time.  This constitutes a slight letdown considering how often I return to the soundtrack from the first movie.

OVERALL: Ex Machina is a sight to behold and warrants a blu-ray purchase.  Just don't expect it to expand much on the ideas introduced in the first Appleseed.",1207612800,31,2222,5.0109289617486334

3045142,1,B0010358CG,"I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with this. The character interactions are like something a first time writer made. Their so abysmal and disinteresting. The reactions to situations in the movie are like a bunch of teenagers. The entire character development (or lack there of) was even more disappointing then the first. The first had at least a little bit of redeeming qualities even though the dialogue was fairly weak. This movie just made me wanna change the channel if it was on tv. If you're oohed and aahed by anything flashy and shiny, you might get something from this movie. Even then I doubt it as the action sequences aren't close to the 2004 Appleseed. The fact that the voices changed was even more disappointing. Every single character was done by a different voice actor. I mean come on. To some people the voices are just voices, but to me and many others the characters' established voices were kind of like their identity. Sometimes I got lost in who was actually talking if the voice was from off screen.

Basically take Applessed 2004 and smash it to death with a baseball bat and you get Ex Machina. A bastardized version of the 2004 make. I don't know if they just got too far in the film to turn and go, ""It sucks lets start over."" But I really wish they would have just done that. Overall a movie that leaves a gross taste in my mouth. I'll be honest and say that I couldn't watch it all the way through. I couldn't really see the ridiculous characters doing, saying, being anything redeemable. If you wanna see it, find a friend who has it and laugh at him for buying it after you watch it.",1207440000,3,1638,4.496644295302014
3045143,5,B0010358CG,"The sequel to 2004's Appleseed is worthy of its predecessor and absolutely stunning.

3045146,5,B0010358CG,"My only beef with this was the ""hand of god"" scene in the end that reminded me too much of Matrix Revolutions.

That being said this is still a FANTASTIC adventure!

The story telling is done superbly.

The relationship between Briareos and Deunan is fleshed out very nicely.

The inner conflict that Briareos has between his humanity and cyborg chassis is played out very well as an external conflict with his genetic equal.

There is a lot of good to say about this film.
1) High action (you would expect from a John Woo film).
2) Close attention to details that make the world believable.
3) Story telling that compels you to watch.
4) High production quality.
5) And, a solid love story that displays integrity and loyalty for one partner. (Who could blame Deunan if she fell for Briareos's bioroid? But in the end she stayed true to what is left of the man she loves... that is a fine display of how relationships should be.)

The animation and overall production quality is even higher than the first of these done in 2004. I have to admit, I didn't realize the production quality could get better until I saw this one.

The characters have lost a bit of their ""traditional anime"" look but it really is an improvement.

I can't wait for the next installment of the ""Appleseed Saga"".",1206662400,,1288,4.569565217391304
3045147,4,B0010358CG,"Animation - Prior to Ex Machina, the previous Appleseed anime (2004) was the best Appleseed anime yet.  Unfortunately it suffered from awkward animation.  The motion capture CG looked nice until the characters began moving around.  Ex Machina fixes that for the most part.  The movements are almost as smooth as those in FFVII Advent Children.  There are still some awkward movements in this film, but only on a couple of minor parts.  John Woo's influence can be seen in the fight sequences, as well as some Matrix-type moments, but they aren't overdone.  If you are an old school John Woo fan, you'll like the small touches (doves!)...brings back memories of ""The Killer.""

Character design - The characters are very well designed and still retain an anime feel to them, not being made too realistic.  Deunan's design has changed a bit from the ""orthodox"" look, which 2004 had kept.  She has a younger and softer appearance, but it's not bad.  I like how they gave a lot of focus on Briareos, especially on his cyborg body.  His body seems more human-like like in the manga.  This is especially emphasized in his combat with other characters and his clothing.  I noticed his eyes were a different color from the 2004 anime, but that's fine...he's a cyborg; it shouldn't difficult to change the color of his ""eyes.""  Other characters, such as Hitomi, are also done very well.  The outfits, overall, were very nice.

Story elements - The story is very good.  The two main elements are: 1) relational, between Deunan and Briareos, and 2) conflict, against an antagonist who threatens the genetically-altered peace (Bioroid led world).  The relational theme is the most well done, and runs throughout the movie, bringing in a new character to help it along.  More history was given about the relationship b/n Deunan and Briareos, and explained their love for one another, which was kind of ambiguous in the past.  Briareos's character is deeper in Ex Machina, which I really appreciated.  They also did a good job of tying it in with the world crisis theme, which actually seemed to be there just to support the relational theme.  The world crisis theme was not as deep or developed, and seems to end somewhat abruptly, which is why I feel like it was just a support for the relational theme.

Overall, this is a great anime.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in Appleseed.",1206662400,2,2382,4.807881773399015

3045149,3,B0010358CG,"We get a decent story, but what the heck happened to the characters? First off, the voice actors have been changed for a number of characters. This is more an issue with the dub, but the sub also has some key characters with changed voices. To add to this we have characters with complete personality changes and even major appearance changes. While we never got a real good look at Briareos before he became a cyborg in the last movie, we got enough of a look to know that how he is represented in this movie looks completely different.

This movie is also too dependent on cheesy and flashy action sequences. Heck, the movie opens with an action sequence and once that ends and we move on to the next scene we're pretty much thrown in to yet another completely separate action sequence. We understand that these guys know what they're good at, but developing the story would be kinda nice.

Once the story gets going it isn't that bad, although weaker than the previous movie in my opinion. It seems to exist simply as a means of find excuse after excuse to show action scenes rather than existing to tell a good story.

The animation itself, and the appearance of the characters especially, is far better in this version than the previous one. The action scenes, while over the top and a bit tiring, are still great to watch and are really what makes the movie worth watching. This movie is like ""Advent Children"" in that it seems to exist simply to show a lot of action and flash. The main difference is that the action in this one is worth sitting through the faults for.

The voice acting, despite being different, isn't that bad. I feel they should have kept the actors the same for the sequel, but you get used to them for the most part. The music is pretty standard and not quite up to the level of the last one, but still decent enough, especially considering it wasn't that notable in the first film.

All in all it's great for action, but when it comes to the story and how it performs as a sequel, it was honestly a disappointment. If you like Appleseed it's worth viewing, but I wouldn't set your expectations to high if you're expecting anything other than a lot of flash and little substance.",1206316800,3,2208,4.4689826302729525
3045150,4,B0010358CG,"Appleseed Ex Machina is a sequel to 2004's Appleseed; produced by John Woo and directed by Shinji Aramaki, the duo comes with an entertaining futuristic thriller adapted from the manga by Shirow Masamune (Ghost in the Shell). The revolutionary CGI animation is astonishing, combined with awesome action sequences reminiscent of John Woo movies, Appleseed Ex Machina looks very promising. Thankfully, you do not need to see the 2004 film to appreciate and comprehend this new film's premise. The plot itself lacks depth, it is so predictable that everything is laid out for the viewer; this animated feature is more about CGI and action than anything else. It definitely feels to be geared to international audiences than to Shirow's native land.

The year is 2133, civilization is recovering from the global war that almost devastated the world. Utopian cities are on the rise, technological advancements are dominating the world and humans have a fresh new attitude to match their new surroundings. Cyborgs are very common, machine parts are used to replace severed limbs and body parts. Bioroids are being cloned from humans to use as soldiers that lack human emotion and violent tendencies that often get humanity in trouble. Quoted as "" incapable of hate and anger, will only fight and kill when absolutely necessary..."" or are they? The passive bioroids are intended to keep order so that the world can maintain the peace without the hostile influences of hatred and rage.
Special forces specialist Deunan and Briareos are partners from the days that Briareos was human. Briareos is a special case, since he is the only human being who managed to survive being 100% cyborg without going insane. When Briareos was injured (or damaged), he becomes replaced by Tereus, a bioroid cloned from his human DNA.
When an unknown enemy plans a stealth attack by reducing common folk into technological zombies who turn the city into a war zone, the trio must settle their differences to quell this threat.

Appleseed isn't as bad as I first thought it would be. Renowned action scribe John Woo definitely showed his hand with most (not all) of the action sequences. The action is visually stylish and definitely looks cool. Woo's usual gimmicks are omnipresent in the proceedings; bike stunts, stylish bullet ballet and helter skelter action sequences are what's in store for the viewer. ""Ex machina"" also has the same mecha action in its previous installment. The film definitely feels like it is geared towards an specific audience and therefore lost some of the atmosphere and depth that contemporary sci-fi anime has been known for. ""Ex Machina"" is about the action, it is a straightforward film with one-dimensional antagonists with motivations completely predictable and something that has been  done through the years.

The emotional aspect of Deunan and Briareos' relationship is quite interesting and serves as the film's main premise. Despite the fact that Deunan has kept her humanity and Briareos has lost 85% of his body, their commitment and love for each other remains strong. However, their relationship is thrown into a loop when Tereus gets into the mix, since he is a clone from Briareos human DNA. Yes, there is a bit of a sappy love triangle here that has the same elements that we've all seen before.

The animation is quite good. The film sidesteps the usual anime style and effectively combines modern and contemporary anime. The backdrops are astounding and definitely catches the architecture of the future. The characters look almost photorealistic without the usual ""over expressive, super fair complexioned characters. Deunan is rendered to look like a lethal but sexy woman, with the designer, Prada taking a hand in one of her outfits. The graphics are definitely an improvement over the 2004 film, but still falls short to the quality of ""Final Fantasy Advent Children"" and ""Biohazard:Degeneration"".

Appleseed Ex Machina is overall a success I suppose. Fans of the 2004 film will definitely appreciate this sequel and newer fans will be impressed. I'm not saying that this film should be your first experience with anime, there are definitely more worthy titles than this film. This film is more about entertainment and not the usual philosophical and existential fare that contemporary Japanese Anime has been famous for. It fell into the usual plot holes and predictability that is so reminiscent of animated films geared for a younger audience. It is a popcorn movie more than anything else. APPLESEED Ex MACHINA is good but NOT essential.

3045152,4,B0010358CG,"Lets start from the top..
The case this movie comes in is insanely nice- high definition printing-gloss metallic shine on aluminum and it's a book styled case-in fact its exactly the same type of case that the Gits SCC special edition movie came in...disk one contains the movie and some extras, disk two contains a ""definitive history of Appleseed""..and some art doc about anime..i tend to find that while the ""history"" is very cool the rest of it is rather useless..I would have preferred some sort of enhanced soundtrack disk..also whats cool about this package is that you get a mini Appleseed Dark Horse comic. Very cool!

Story mechanics:
Story wise I would like to think that Exmachina is like the episode 2 of the first movie that was left out...sorta... cause it just kind of starts...not like the massive entrance sequence from the first...Now overall once it gets moving its actually rather quite solid...once thing leads to another..and the story makes actual sense...unlike in the previous movie where it was one chop after another.. Although while its solid there are elements of it that are direct copies from other movies and it's a blatant. The giant floating announcement ship with digital signs: Blade Runner, The ""swarm"" of flying drones and there behavior- Matrix Revolutions, ""we are all one""-Star Trek Voyager.. And the list goes on and on and on...I mean were talking over 40% of story is ripped from other media...BUT even with all of this the mix seems very unique and futuristic ..its just not that original ..but flipside wise it  also matches the Appleseed universe pretty well. This Story is also more mature than the previous story line..much in the way that Second Gig was a major mature shift for the Gits Franchise- death, cussing, terrorists, murder, riots, and plenty of  violence..Although all in all its entertaining and yes the story has depth to it...finally!

Graphics:  MASSIVE upgrade from the first movie...very well thought out...Tons of awesome camera work...for anime its right up there with Ergo Proxy and Advent when it comes to shear graphics capability..the animation is also far more detailed...its right on par with the times..and OH YEA TONS OF ACTION!!! gotta hand it to Woo and Aramaki...pretty good!!

Voice: American voice cast is top notch!!!!..they all sound very intense and the lines are pretty good..granted some are cheesy

The one thing I loved the most about Ex Machina was the voice acting (eventhough the timing was a bit off at times). It has been done perfectly, right on top with the likes of FullMetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell. Luci Christian (although I am not too fond of her) does a wonderful job as Deunan, BTW you may remember her a Kaname Chidori from Full Metal Panic.

A new character, Tereus bring a fresh look to the cast. You can view him as the human part of Briareos. I, sometimes, felt that director Shinji Aramaki could have dwelled more into Deunan's and Briareos's romance (same thing with the first movie). Battle scenes are awesome, as expected from John Woo. Character models look like plastic barbies sometimes, but other times, they will blow your brains out.

Although, people will view this sequel as just a fan service to the original movie, I believe it is definitely worthy of being added to your anime collection. I cannot say anything about its DVD counterpart, but Appleseed: EX Machina (Blu-ray) on a 46"" Bravia played on a PS3 with 5.1 surround sound at 1080p will make you wonder if there is anything else better in life.",1206057600,4,1414,4.537254901960784

The first movie was an acceptable (see: pretty and light) but standard anime, relying heavily on its look to distinguish itself. The cg in Ex Machina is far superior, the animation has improved quite a bit, and the storytelling is much more streamlined. Exposition is definitely there, just like the first, but the pacing is way superior. Sure, its got a lot of nonsense science, but any fan of anime in general will find something here. It's got stuff to appeal to girls and boys and in blu-ray it looks freakin' amazing. A great purchase, and a visual contender with heavyweights Beowulf and Final Fantasy TSW in the cg category.

Pros +
+ More Briarios
+ Improved English Voice Acting Dramatically
+ Better Pacing
+ Amazing Visual Quality and Sound

Dialogue - The worst aspect of this movie is the unbelievably horrible dialogue; so bad it will make you cringe.
Story - As others have noted, you get the feeling there were multiple writers for the story and they kept getting fired and only using half of the previous writers work; a few almost interesting points are brought up in the movie and then abandoned before they can be explored.  It should also be noted that the movie steals (without adding or improving) quite a lot from other movies, the matrix, the borg cube, etc.
Animation - While it's admittedly a nice clean HD transfer, the actual CG animation used looks like it's from one of the straight-to-video Barbie movies; half the time the characters move in a very unnatural, stilted way.

The CGI effects are excellent except when it comes to the animation of body movement and character interaction in non-action scenes.  I'm not sure if it's the affects of the CGI cell-shading or if it's by design (cuz it seems rather glaring to me), but the characters seem to move like plastic dolls.  There are scenes in which human flesh is depicted to come in contact with metallic cyborgs (such as the scenes between Deunan and Briareros), but because of the clunky animation of the bodies and the seemingly unresponsive physical contact between characters, I miss out on the emotional conflict of what it must be like to be in love with a machine. The action gun-fight sequences are outrageous, but that is to be expected with John Woo at the helm of production.  Personally, I don't mind the over-the-top flipping, looping, twisting, whirling gun fights.  Those scenes are fun to watch, for me.  Buildings, scenery, character models, and vehicle CGI are top-notch.  Overall, most people would be the animation style of Appleseed E.M.

Now what I don't like,(perhaps this is due to the nature of Animes in general) is how little things just don't make any sense.  For instance, in the first action scene, Deunan (the main female protagonist) launches a flash bomb into small group of terrorist before the order to attack was given.  I understand a part of that scene was to illustrate she's an independent and strong woman not privy to the command of others at times...but the flash bomb really didn't provide any additional advantage to the ESWAT attack. Did I miss something?  Why did she throw that flash grenade and jeopardize the entire mission?  Then, after the scene in which Briareros grabs Deunan and jumps out of the chapel window, one of the ESWAT member holds her back from running to his body. Why couldn't she run to his body? Perhaps I'm too nit-picky, but for anyone who is like me, this ruins a movie.  I would have given the movie at least a 4 were it not for those bits of the storyline which left a bad taste for me.",1205366400,,2137,4.712365591397849
3045172,5,B0010358CG,"What a cool flick, much better than Appleseed 2004. Great actions sequences it has John Woo written all over it. It even has some scenes from the Matrix trilogy. See it in HD my friends, beautiful vivid picture.",1205366400,5,211,4.578947368421052
3045173,5,B0010358CG,"Ok, first of all, if you're not an anime-fan, you'd feel a bit lost on what's the big deal with this.
If you don't know Shirow Masamune, then you'd definitely feel lost.

If you know John Woo and had followed his work...then this will catch your attention. thumbsup.gif
Imagine, Mission Impossible 2, Face Off, Hard Boiled, A Better Tomorrow 1,2,3, The Killer, Once a Thief and Hard Target in animation.

If you like The Matrix cyberpunk story, this is for you, except its not dark to hide its flaws. This movie actually celebrates details. And details are abound in here. Even if its a close up in the eyes, the mouth, the lips, the jawlines.

If your a gamer that starves into details; who spends $500 on a videocard so you can see the textures of those leaves in Crysis, then this movie is definitely for you. This movie does not cut any corners in textures and details. If a character is wearing a leather jacket, you'll see leather. The CGs in this movie is tremendous. I've seen it twice in a 24hr-span I'm still seeing things I've never noticed in the beginning. The motion capture technology is simply amazing.

Ok, but does it have a story?

Does Jason and the Argonauts have an interesting story?
Is it really ground breaking? When Gene Roddenberry introduce the communicator, he brought in the cellphone.
Shirow Masamune introduced a theory in sci-fi, brings a story into this, but continues by illustrates it also.
It tackles a love story, technology available now and the future, politics, ethics, ideology, and the dilemma that each brings into the story. If you look closely at the armor protections, paddings and vest, you'll see them in current Blackhawk vest, and those riot gears worn by cops worldwide. Even the the FN PN-90 resembles one of the Seburo PDW

With all talks about eye-candy, then maybe perhaps this is a guy movie. The hero in this movie is a woman.
The people in power are women. The women here are powerful in the sense of strength, character, and conviction.
This Matrix with Trinity as the center of the movie.

Is this a date movie? Was Open Water a date movie? I thought so, since it deals with emotions on both the joy that a relationship brings and the love of separation, of acceptance. Bioroids/synthetic body parts/cyborgs may seem cold, but the emotions in each character are delivered. Despite one of the major character, Briareos Hecatonchires faceless facade, his body language are enough to say or deliver his lines.
There are topics that discusses the nature of being a human vs a clone. Would you continue to have feeling towards someone who is a clone? Would you let someone go to save your own?
I bet the ladies will notice the style and textures differently from guys.
The guys in these forum will love the shooting gallery scene

Shirow Masamune's mind something to be admired and ponder. Here he writes a story about the future, yet he discuss are slavery towards technology like the Bluetooth earpiece. I know ppl who seems to sleep, shower, and have sex with a Bluetooth earpiece. Politically, he shares the idea a utopia where everything flows like clockwork and smoothly, yet vulnerable to terrorism, as we are now. He brings the technology in medicine that allows us to continue life and existence, yet prone to the devices that makes the delicate-geniuses-in lab coats criminally insane.

If there is a movie that deserves to be in HI-DEF, this is that movie.",1205280000,4,3423,4.739495798319328
3279437,2,B0010358CG,"This looks very good. The visuals are amazing on an HDTV. I am about 30 mins into the movie and I have to say that the story, acting and animation is horrible.

First the actors from the first do not lend their voices to this one.
Some of the characters seem to be different than from the first movie. The acting is pretty stiff and cliche (the tough cyborg guy is annoying).
Some of the fights are just stupid for stupids sake. I mean does Duenan and Briarious need to spin and do cartwheels while shooting? It doesn't even look cool, just stupid.

Why did they go with CGI models 100% this time? Did the old animated cells not work anymore? It sure looked a LOT better.

The events from the first movie don't even seem to play a part at all which is a shame.

I loved the first movie but I wouldn't consider this deserving of the same name. I will be selling this shortly as I regret buying it.

2 stars just because if you mute it, it looks very sharp.",1205193600,4,955,4.168478260869565
3279438,4,B0010358CG,"Back in 2004, Appleseed came stateside, after being in Japan for years. For it's time, it had great special effects alongside some of the best CGI seen. Now its 2008, and Appleseed Ex Machina is here. I must say, CGI just keeps getting better, and this is a shining example of that. Animations, facial expressions and the lip-movement when the characters are talking help bring this anime life. Since John Woo helped produce the sequel, expect to see some of his trademarks, like the doves and slow motion sequences. But they all fit into the movie perfectly. For being a sequel, I am surprised how this turned out. However, if I have to pick out one gripe, that would be the dialog. Some of the lines can get on the cheesy side. Other than that, be sure to give this a look if you've seen the original. Otherwise, if you are the least bit interested in  GCI/Anime, still give this one a chance.",1205193600,4,895,4.49079754601227
3279439,4,B0010358CG,"One of the more underdeveloped storylines from ""Appleseed"" was the relationship between Deunan Knute and her cyborg love, Briareos.

Well, ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" more than makes up for that. In fact, this CGI action flick boasts upgrades in every area -- a tighter plot, more complex conspiracies, and more lifelike animation. It's a stunning experience with loads of fiery, spinning action scenes, albeit with a slightly improbable villain.

Olympus has a new threat -- brainwashed cyborgs that are kidnapping officials, and disrupting planetary peace. During a rescue mission, Briareos is injured and hospitalized for awhile -- and Deunan introduced to her new partner Tereus -- a warrior bioroid cloned from Briareos' DNA.  She's furious, Briareos is depressed, and all three are confused by Tereus' similarities to Briareos.

But when President Athena calls an international conference, E-SWAT only narrowly stops an attack force -- of cyborgs and ordinary humans who have somehow been possessed by a mechanical goo. Their message: ""I am Halcon... all will be one."" And worst of all, Briareos is somehow being affected by the baddies, so he decides to do some investigating on his own. Now Deunan, Briareos and Tereus must join forces despite their tension, and stop a malevolent conspiracy that threatens the entire world....

While the first ""Appleseed"" movie had a rather simple plot, ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" tends toward complexity. Everything is bigger -- the conspiracies, the mad scientist stuff, the potential warfare, and even the love story. And despite its fuller plot, the sequel actually manages to cram in some quiet moments between robot battles and personal scuffles.

Director Shinji Aramaki does a pretty good job with a pretty good plot -- he unrolls it gradually, filling it with tension and horror at all the right moments. It kicks off strongly with an explosive, fire-and-darkness battle in an abandoned cathedral, and doesn't slow much down. Lots of explosive battles and zombiesque attacks, but not so many that it overwhelms the storyline.

Along the way, Aramaki drops in some very ""human"" scenes, such as a funeral and Hitomi's glammy birthday party. In fact, there are even some funny, cute moments such as Briareos and Deunan tussling over some monitoring wires in the hospital. These moments keep them acting like people.

What's the problem? Well, while Aramaki succeeds in surprising us with the main villain, it's revealed rather late in the movie, and there's never much of a motive.

But the CG animation is stunning. There's everything from mid-air shootouts to serpentine silver tentacles. Even the settlings are striking, with their Greco-futuristic marble, columns and sci-fi gadgets. And there's a breathtaking level of detail -- reflections, light, raindrops on Briareos' metal face, and tiny facial chances. Some character still have ""doll face,"" but not as much.

But this movie gets its heart from the love triangle, which is thankfully handled in a mature manner. Deunan and Briareos' loving, intense relationship gets plenty of cute moments, despite the confusion that Tereus causes them. And Tereus is a well-drawn rival, with a lot of Briareos' rough kindness, but also the insecurities of being a ""copy.""

And Aramaki particularly concentrates on Briareos' fears that Deunan will prefer a flesh-and-blood lover, and that he is gradually losing his sanity. There's an undercurrent of raw pain when he screams at Tereus, ""why do you have everything I've lost?""

""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is a worthy sequel that actually tops the preceding film -- a stunning CGI shell around a solid sci-fi/love story. Definitely worth checking out.",1205193600,14,3681,5.284246575342466
3279440,3,B0010358CG,"alright...so ive been lookin around the web and find a lot of people who have a large number of complaints about the original appleseed from 2004.  IMO, the first was AMAZING.  The voiceovers, in english and japanese were if you ask me very well done.  the animation was unique and cell shading felt like the perfect type for the movie.  The new appleseed...Ex Machina, just didn't have the same feel.  The voiceovers are by new people for both Deunan and Briarious, and honestly, if you liked the originals, i don't see why you would like these.  i began watching parts of the movie and just didn't feel satisfied with it so i skipped ahead to just see the end and understood everything that had been going on through the rest.  No filler felt needed and everything just seemed so...rushed?  My other big complaint, in the first appleseed there is a short clip (dream from Deunan's perspective) which shows a bit of Briarious and if you ask me, in this movie, his 'clone' looked far from the same.

This is all just my opinion.  I loved the first one and would reccomend either a rent or download this.  Not worth the 20 dollars and space it takes to keep.",1205107200,3,1157,4.514423076923077
3279441,4,B0010358CG,"The visuals are nothing short of stunning, especially in HD. It's worth the download just to check out how beautifully the cg animation is rendered. The action scenes are tight, with Matrix-esque slow motion shots, crazy camera angles and an emphasis on heavy gun play, indicative of producer John Woo's style. One drawback on the cg animation though is that when characters interact with each other physically it seems awkward. They don't feel like they are touching. I imagine that when you make something with animation like that you'd run into clipping issues when the characters intereact heavily. In fact, it reminded me of cut scenes from Eternal Sonata, a video game using similar animation techniques but on a bigger scale obviously.

The story is an upgrade from the first movie, although the main antagonist borrows heavily from classic Star Trek villain, the Borg. There's even a Borg like cube of sorts that serves as it's foundation. The subplot consists of a triangle between Deunan, Briareos (the main protagonists from the first movie) and Tereus, a biroid created mostly from Briareos's DNA who becomes Deunan's new partner after her lover falls in battle.

If I were to make a criticism I'd say that the main antagonist was revealed a tad too late, making the final resolution a little anti-climactic. At a runtime of about an hour and 40 minutes I felt like another 20 minutes would have been justified. When it was over, I couldn't quite believe it at first. Also, and this may be a good thing, events from the first movie go almost completely without mention. This means that you won't have to have seen the first one to appreciate this, but at the same time there is a lack of continuity for those that did.

All in all though, it's a good film and worth a watch.",1204588800,45,1786,4.754838709677419

I had high hopes for the quality given that it's a newer movie created with modern CGI techniques and not only did this not disappoint, it completely obliterated all of my expectations. The opening scene of the Church assault is so visually impressive I've put the movie in just to watch that scene and taken it out again. It's that well done. The colors are sharp and bright when necessary and beautifully subdued in the night scenes. The neon glows are very striking and really catch the eye.

The sound quality is fantastic. I have a decent surround sound system, not top of the line by any means, and I can hear everything with crystal clear quality. Again going back to the chruch assault opening the sound of the shell casing striking the ground is so well done you can hear every time *ping* when they strike even with the concussion sounds of the bullets being fired. This is how bluray anime should be.

If your an Appleseed fan and have this on DVD (or are contemplating buying it if) you should give it a go as this is one great transfer.",1401494400,,1238,4.517857142857143

3279518,3,B0010358CG,"Since I watched the first movie (Appleseed), I figured I might as well watch the sequel.  Unfortunately, it impressed me even less than its predecessor.  The main character Deunan is even crabbier than in the first film.  The angst between her and her old boyfriend, bunny boy Briareos, is ratcheted up a notch with the intrusion of a Bioroid who just happens to look exactly like her old boyfriend used to before he donned the bunny looking suit.  No surprise considering it was Briareos' DNA that helped make the new and improved prototype of Bioroid soldiers, aptly named Tereus.  Of course, there's a diabolical plot a foot.  People are turned into zombies with the aid of earpieces giving them false directives.  Cyborgs are especially at risk considering they're mostly hardware and wires, doodads, and bits of bunny fluff.  It's a bit on the wacky side, with a cool floating city that looks like an upside down ziggurat.  The villain of the piece is easy to spot.  The idea of making everyone of one mind is not new or particularly fresh.  The artwork is great when it comes to backgrounds, not so much with the plastic-looking characters (Deunan literally looks like a Barbie doll).

Indeed, I've not seen the first Appleseed film, so take that into account. In that absolute sense, I'd have to regard this film as both a joy and a bore to watch. The computer animation is very good most of the time. In some places, actually, it's marvelous while in others the motion is less convincing. The urban views and shots of  flying machines are truly stupendous. On the other hand, the plot was quite predictable, and the story too often seemed to be several combat scenes strung one after the other with some dialogue in between. And though those combat scenes were often reasonably effective, I found the climactic one extremely unconvincing. The character interactions struck me as a bit stiff, even for anime, and rather monotonous. So overall my reaction is mixed -- this film is nice for the eye but less so for the brain. It depends on which organ you're more in the mood to exercise.",1358208000,,1102,4.5376884422110555

The original one seemed pretty ahead of it's time technologically and had all the stuff you would expect in a really good anime but enhanced with state of the art CGI. This new one I think is way worse that the original even though the CGI was technically better , but maybe that's because the CGI software has improved, not neccessarily because they did something better this time around. I think that because this is supposed to be anime (japanese based) and they mixed John Woo in there (chinese), the japanese chinese mix just doesn't go well together. I am not joking about that, I am asain myself but something obviously wasn't right about this movie. The whole thing seemed disjointed emotionally and visually in this movie. They should have just kept the original people who worked on the first movie to make this second one. Even the voice actors in this really troubled me, there wasn't any real emotional conntection between Briarios and Daunan this time around, I mean japanese anime is kinda wierd already but this was just weird wierd. very disappointed, but still overall a decent movie.",1356912000,,1173,4.840796019900497

3279547,4,B0010358CG,"(if you have questions...feel free and ask)
Part of the Appleseed saga of movies, games, manga, and Tv show; ""Ex Machina"" served as a worthy and spectacular addition to ""the family"". But of course, first the content stuff...

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED FOLKS...
This movie is actually a pretty clean movie. There's no nudity or situations warranting that (I'm sure that should be a clear enough statement). In fact, the clothing is much more conservative in comparison to what some of the characters from the previous CGI Appleseed wore. There are some language issues to take note of. D-word is pretty common in the early 3rd of the movie. B-word is pretty much used about 5 times from an enraged criminal trying to fight his way from arrest. F-word is used once. Violence-wise, it's not as vicious (crushed heads...literally) as the first Appleseed movie...but it's still as action packed and visually artistic as ever. Besides that, there's not much else to worry or be concerned about. Thematically, it's not as deep as the first one, but still some things worth musing and contemplating over. Teenagers and older can enjoy this.

MOVING ON...
""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is a beautifully rendered film dealing with the issues about the essence of humanity, security, love, and unity. You do not need to be familiar with every ""Appleseed"" film/manga to enjoy...not even the prequel movie. Though of course, if you are familiar, then you can glean more from it. But, they do make sure to give you good and unobtrusive flashbacks to help you understand details that newcomers to the franchise would miss. In fact, this was my first ""Appleseed"". The CG is majorly improved from the first one.  In fact, there it is vastly improved on the visual emotions factor...much more believable...if u like animation in general, that alone is captivating. If anime characters could ever exist in the real world, it would be something like this. But the animators, producers, and director do not rely on the vastly improved animation quality to carry it. Instead of focusing the audience towards the amazing wow factor of the CG, they use the graphics to subtly create a very vibrant and living world. They immerse the audience through a futuristic fantasy world that you can't help but fall in love with. From the birthday parties to walking down the street...even minor details in the scenery and social ambience was carefully and lovingly crafted. Also, the English dubs are actually very brilliant and matching to the characters...one of my favorite dubbing jobs. Also, there are tons of action sequences and they aren't just ""spun together"". They are very well crafted...and a narrative in of itself in some ways. On top of that, it's not only artistic, but strangely believable (even though some things are blatantly not reality).

Story:
As far as the story is concerned. It's not as deep as the previous movie. But that does not mean it's no less good. The tale is very cohesive and well thought out. The pacing is good...no moments where you feel like, ""get on with it!"". Every moment serves a complimentary purpose to the film. Some minor plot twists as well. Also, just like the previous film, it deals with themes. However, I will say that it's execution of them are good, but nothing that will ""raise the bar"". Still, I loved the overall narrative and the way it was executed...and still good lessons to learn from it. Also, the allusions to Greek mythology really adds so much to it...though subtly.

There are some fun special features as well. They include a documentary about the teaming up of John Woo (a Hong Kong action movie legend) and Shinji Aramaki (an anime power house) for this project, another documentary about the advances in animation & dubbing process that helped bring more life to the film...that was my favorite special (very eye-opening and you garner much more respect for the people who worked on it), and the usual filmmaker's commentary. Good and fun stuff.

ALL IN ALL
""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is a beautifully rendered film taking place in a very engaging and immersive world. It's not particularly profound, but it's not completely without meat. An excellent lighter experience mixed with good storytelling and vibrant visuals. Definitely worth a shot.",1332460800,,4282,4.948539638386648

3279549,5,B0010358CG,"Now for most of the people who know me, I'm a shooter gamer buff. I like my guns, mecha, and just blowing stuff up and taking names. That said sometimes there WILL be a non-gaming media hit that catches my eye, probably because it's pretty much shooter gamer buff stuff in anime form. This recent sometime would be Appleseed: Ex Machina, where there are guns mecha, just blowing stuff up, and taking names, in anime form.

The movie starts off with ""who are these people?"" for the first ten minutes, that and the art style takes about that much time getting used to. The cel-shaded, oozing anime-style is obvious as some people mentioned before, the graphics seem like an up-scaled japanese game. After the opening scene ends and you're eyes adapt to the style, there is nothing but action really here on out. The characters don't take long to get used to and like, and if you're an Action/Romance buff like me who is a sucker for stuff like Robotech, there is plenty of low-key mushy stuff to mellow you out between the action-packed sequences.

The character design is a masterpiece, and like most anime buffs like me, you'll get your healthy dose of buff dudes, hot chicks, and cheesy but also relatable dialogue. That said, I was somewhat amazed that they were able to sneak in an F-bomb in this PG-13 title, but the scene with it is quite short. Also with that said the story is almost edging on Star Trek themes, to which I'm not going to spoil that point for you. Obviously they gave the movie universal Sci-fi appeal for the cautious westerners who may be put off with the anime design.

With that said, I found the movie a blast with my perfect mix of Action/Romance, Anime, and Cool/Attractive characters that I think was money beyond well spent. I see me definitely watching this movie multiple times and add to my personal Robotech collection.

After the original ""Appleseed"" gained popularity from maybe a cult level, the sequel was long-awaited. The film makers must have known the original was incredibly designed on every level. What was already made was put to the most cutting edge computer animation resources for this second film.

As a sequel I will assume many will know about the story elements. I will simply say that that this is a well connected continuation. At the time of it's release a third was planned, apparently dropped but not absolutely sure. You can be sure this is good in every way.

3279562,4,B0010358CG,"Appleseed Ex Machina is the sequel to the 2004 Appleseed film that was directed by Shinji Aramaki.  It continues the story of Deunan and Briareos, and also introduces a couple of new characters (Tereus and Aeacus).

The languages menu for the Appleseed Ex Machina DVD is a little on the frustrating side.  It is done in such a way that the language option for each country is written in that respective country's language.  Unfortunately, this means that the Japanese and Chinese options are written with the Japanese and Chinese characters.  If you want to choose either of those as a language option, you have to have some familiarity with the written characters.  Also, after you choose the language, you are automatically returned to the main menu.  In order to indicate that you want subtitles, you have to return to the languages menu and choose the subtitles.

The regular release of Appleseed Ex Machina also has two short documentaries on it.  The first is ""Team Up: John Woo and Shinji Aramaki.""  This runs for about sixteen and a half minutes, and through interviews with Shinji Aramaki, crew members, and anime journalists, you find out what each of these individuals brought to Appleseed Ex Machina.  The other documentary is ""Revolution: Animating Ex Machina.""  This runs for about eighteen and a half minutes, and it talks about how the animation was done for the film, and it also delves a little bit into the English dubbing for the project.  The trailers feature only includes two anime-related trailers (both of which are for the live-action version of Speed Racer).  There is also an audio commentary.

There was also a two-disc special edition version released for Appleseed Ex Machina.  The second disc includes two documentaries.  The first is ""The Appleseed Chronicles.""  It runs for about twenty minutes, and goes into the history of the Appleseed manga.  Personally, I was a little disappointed that this feature never touched on the 1988 OVA version of Appleseed or the 2004 Appleseed film directed by Shinji Aramaki.  The other documentary is ""East Meets West,"" and it runs for about eighteen and a half minutes.  This feature talks about how anime crossed over into the west, and how various terms and ideas involved with anime have been cross-pollinated between the Japanese and American cultures.

In my opinion, Appleseed Ex Machina was a strong follow-up to the Appleseed film.  The computer animation used in this film is even better than in the first film, and there are some shots and sequences where you truly feel like you're watching a live-action film.

Appleseed Ex Machina is a PG-13 rated film.  It's a violent film, so I really wouldn't recommend it for young children.  However, if you're a fan of the first Appleseed movie, you won't be disappointed by Appleseed Ex Machina.

No, I've not read the manga. No, I've not seen the original Appleseed OAV, but yes I have seen the first Appleseed movie made in '04, and yes it's been a while and I don't remember much. Regarding Ex Machina, however, I got what I expected after hearing John Woo was attached -- an action movie. The plot reminded me of so many other stories that tried to illustrate humanity's over-reliance on technology and how it almost led to their own downfall. But where something like an I, Robot or WALL*E succeeded, Ex Machina faltered by diverting too much attention to art, animation, and action sequences instead of a consistent plot or even a little more characterization, which resulted in a somewhat underwhelming feature. Granted, I, Robot was more of an action/thriller than drama, but even with a few more minutes in run time, it managed to tell a similar story much more effectively. In Ex Machina, I felt there were a lot of little things crammed in such as the interactions between Deunan and Briarios, Briarios' conflict with seeing himself in Tereus, or even Deunan seeing Briarios in Tereus. I felt it tried so hard to establish the characters in such a short amount of time that it ended up losing presence to concentrate on the message or at least tell it in a more poignant narrative. Regardless, though, the actions sequences definitely have that John Woo-ness to them. So if anything, this could probably equate to a decent summer blockbuster if ever produced and cast well enough by Hollywood.

Video - 4.5

As perfect as CG should be on a BD, I'm actually not sure if this was a perfect transfer. Colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness are all pretty sleek on the very intricate character designs and backgrounds, but I could've sworn I noticed maybe 2 or 3 instances of macroblocking within the very thin lines of some characters. It may have just been some kind of light transition from a dialogue part to an action sequence (one particular scene kinda' lit everything up), or it could be that disregarding a large majority of the fluid animation, the crew may have actually slipped up. Other than those minor flaws, though, Ex Machina would probably make for a reasonable demo choice if you wanted to show off something animated not by Pixar. As stated before, the gunfight/action sequences are pretty cool to watch.

Audio - 3.5

As typical of Warner, they decided this was a less than worthy title to give any lossless audio to. And while the regular Dolby Digital 5.1 Japanese track (I hate ADV, so no I don't care about the dub) did enough, I can't help but wonder how much better it COULD'VE sounded had it been bumped up a notch to a Dolby TrueHD encode. Directionality and dialogue are pretty good for what it's worth in the front sound stage, but I felt the surround channels were vastly underutilized, especially given the bombastic action and gunfire scenes that definitely would've given this entire feature that extra oomph. But for whatever reason, Warner, even with a 50GB disc, didn't feel the need to do it. Idiots.

Extras - 4.5

I actually watched the special features before even watching the movie because I was eating dinner and am not very adept when it comes to grabbing food while reading subtitles. But I have to say that thanks to that, I actually enjoyed the film a little more than I might have initially. All extras are presented in HD and cover various topics ranging from the atypical production notes to the history and study of Masamune Shirow and the Appleseed franchise to even some cultural factoids and observations about Japan, anime fandom, and its carryover/reception into the U.S. Being an anime fan since I was around 10, but being out of the loop for a little over half a year, I found it to be refreshingly informative to see these people discuss the cultural phenomenon that most Americans are probably alien to. It was a good watch for the new, old, and uninformed, giving great perspective on the whole thing.

Overall - 4.0

Appleseed: Ex Machina had the right concept going, but as most anime movie features go, there just wasn't enough time for everything. I can respect movies that are supposed to be a straight dose of whatever their intended genre like actioners (Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, or Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture), mind trips (anything by Satoshi Kon), or dramas (anything by Makoto Shinkai). However, you get the feeling some times that a movie can be so much more. Unfortunately for Ex Machina, while full of some great action sequences, it was short on a good screenplay, concentrating a little too much on subtle character interactions and less on the themes and story at hand. If you can get past that, though, the rest of the disc is good enough for a recommendation",1233273600,,4785,4.73469387755102

However, the writing and acting was very disappointing as it reminded me of some of the things I used to read from my friends in Junior High School.  It's really at that level in my opinion.

3279579,4,B0010358CG,"Only the action is over the top.  But it's 'just' a cartoon, so that's OK, right?

Visually, ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" is overwhelming in detail, design, and in the illusion of camera movement.  The city scapes are so detailed you'd think they were rendered from photos of real urban environments.  Textures of fabric and surfaces are incredible, only a small step from photo realistic.  Only human skin is visibly simplified, consistant with the anim aesthetic.  The opening sequence was set in what appeared to be the cathedral in Koln, Germany, down to the gothic detailing in the buttresses and the stained-glass windows, except you'd never be able to film that kind of action there.  The sci-fi gadgets were equally well done, mostly with a very plausible and appropriate feel.  Pulling in Prada to design costumes for the animation was innovative, and added another layer of depth to the cartoon.

Yeah, the action was over the top.  Noted.  It was no more extreme than 'Matrix', despite having less limits than a photography type movie.  Still, it was appropriate to the medium and plot.

The complexity of the story, the relationships, the character flaws, and depth of the characters pushes out of the Saturday morning league, and past the level of many conventional films.  There is a mixture of flaws, tensions, caring, and bravado entirely fitting the story, but well done.  In the story, there are several layers from a chaste romance between colleagues, questions of trust and loyalty at many levels, to international power games.

I don't normally hold anim in high esteem, but ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" exceeded all expectations.

3279582,2,B0010358CG,"I've never been a huge fan of John Woo. I think Hard Boiled (1992) is one of the greatest action films ever made, and I liked The Killer (1989), A Better Tomorrow (1986), and Bullet In the Head (1990), but we need to be honest with ourselves and recognize that this guy sold his soul to Hollywood in the mid-1990s and hasn't made a great film since 1992.

He has, however, completely destroyed a sequel to one of the best American movies of recent memory (Mission Impossible) by over-Hollywoodizing a uniquely non-Hollywood film made by Hollywood. That's quite an ironic feat that he should be particularly ashamed of. Now we have Appleseed: Ex Machina (2007) to add to the list of Woo-ish debacles over the past 16 years.

This sequel to the exceptional anime drops the ball in a number of respects, yet still proves to be a marginally entertaining movie. The most obvious fault is that numerous events are near copies of science fiction movies from the West, thus making this endeavor much too conventional for a Japanese anime. In addition, the storyline wasn't as well-conceived as the original. Luckily, this movie has just enough positives to earn a watch. The protagonists are very likable characters, the plot is engaging, and the visuals are very good. The action scenes don't reach the levels of exoticism or quality of the original, but they are still moderately entertaining. In the end this is a very flawed picture that will only satisfy anime action junkies that can look around some mediocre elements.

Now, there were some very specific Woo-ish aspects that really annoyed me. First and foremost are the doves. Yes, there are heaping amounts of flying doves in this Japanese anime film! Why the hell is John Woo so obsessed with doves? Yeah, they provide some ironic symbolism during action scenes, but using them to the degree that he does I have no doubts that he touches himself to pictures of doves when he's alone at night. And the fact that he uses these little birdies in almost every one of his movies proves to be almost as annoying as Rob Zombie's habitual use of white trash folk in his movies. Yes, it's that annoying.

But wait. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions regarding just how much influence Woo had in this watchable (yet severely disappointing) sequel. So I fired up the Special Features option on the DVD menu and watched the 16-minute ""Making Of"" featurette that focuses specifically on John Woo's influence as a producer. It provided some much needed information regarding just how far this has-been shell of a director has fallen. Let me run down some of the statements made by the Japanese director and producers of this film:

""This is the first time a big time Hollywood director has tried to tackle Japanese Anime.""

So Woo isn't even recognized as a director of Chinese cinema anymore. How quaint. No one in this ""Making Of"" feature even mentioned his Chinese filmography.

""Japanese producers wanted to expand into the Western market and saw that working with John Woo would be a good match.""

Nice. If your name is dropped by someone as the foremost expert in Hollywoodization, would you really take that as a compliment? Man, this guy has really hit rock bottom.

""John brought his years of experience in Hollywood to it.""

Well, he certainly brought all of the negatives of Hollywood cinema to this production. That was obvious from watching the movie. How many times do you see a Japanese Anime film copy scenes from I Robot and The Matrix Revolutions? Yes, it's really, really pathetic.

The most enlightening statement was with regards to the preliminary Japanese storyboards.

""John took a look at it and came up with some really great notes.""

What was particularly hilarious about this statement is that on-screen you see John Woo's head shaking in a disapproving, almost disgusted manner while watching the initial storyboards. It's almost like he's saying to himself, ""This is way too Japanese for an American audience. We need more slow-mo shots and conventional elements to reach a wider audience and make more money."" Nice job Johnny boy.

Director Shinji Aramaki apparently conceived Ex Machina to be nothing more than a tribute to Woo's work. He says:

""We devised the Cathedral scene before John showed up to pay homage to his work.""

It's really too bad that Aramaki was so accommodating to implementing all of Woo's ideas into the film. It effectively crippled a movie that should have been as good as the original.

I hate to say it, but John Woo is a no-talent has-been who has only harmed the international film industry since making Hard Boiled in 1992. I have no problems with him making tripe in America. Heck, that's what American cinema is for. But don't you DARE to take your new-found money-grubbing mediocrity to Japanese anime - one of the most unconventional genres of cinema in the world today.

Someone needs to stop this guy before he attempts to wreck another Asian movie.",1219190400,4,4954,4.8288075560802834

John Woo and Shinji Aramaki's futuristic tale of cyborgs, bioroids, and humans spotlights the E.S.W.A.T. force of Olympus, a post-apocalyptic city.

Governments from around the world are about to join in a massive satellite-sharing operation. Terrorists attack from unexpected directions, causing turmoil in the city. The core of the E.S.W.A.T. team faces not only their biggest mission, but their most intimate challenge ever. Deunan, a hard-charging human, Briareos, her cyborg partner and love interest, and Tereus, the bioroid fashioned from Briareos's DNA must overcome excruciating obstacles to ensure the peace and safety of not only Olympus, but the world.

The motion-capture technology used for this film is much improved from earlier incarnations. Characters' body movements were the most natural I've seen so far. Unfortunately, the animation style felt far more appropriate to a gaming environment than a movie. My fingers got twitchy in expectation of game play that, of course, never happened. This blended animation style continually pulled me from the story so I could check out where they splurged or skimped on detail (ie: fine facial movements verses chunky locks of hair).

As to the story, I found the love triangle an interesting byplay to the larger situation. A conflicted Deunan deals with two versions of the same man. Set within the bigger frame of a terrifying social meltdown, this emotional situation adds tension to an already difficult day.

For the most part, the story was believable. Certain elements were predictable, but they were presented in a manner that will leave anime fans satisfied.

Hardcore fans might find this film a bit off the pace at times, but, overall, it'll be a fun title to add to your collection.

nothing like the ""ghost in the shell"" series.

the height of this silliness was when our hero pouted, jumped up and down and left the party almost hysterically like a distressed school girl when she found out she had to stick to her new partner even though her old ""broken"" one (not so delicately suggested as her lover) was up and running again. a depiction of extreme unprofessionalism, assuming that she has the right to be outraged for such a personal reason, while sadly implying at the same time that larger matters related to her professional role and mission are secondary in her list of priorities, suggesting a rather unpleasant little girl as the centre of our story. a lot of other scenes could have been made more elegantly, but this one is by far the worst. the lover / combat partner dynamic was clumsily done and the whole thing came across awkward and embarrassing.

one wonders how psychological research had progressed in the era of the story, when being emotionally entangled with the person you partner up with in an extremely high stress profession like our heroes here, was never considered as problematic. adding to that is the fact that our hero is said to be a highly trained ESWAT soldier by the time she was 12 years old, further indicating that specialization in combat that came at the expense of emotional maturity was tolerated by design in this futuristic world where information is king and abstraction of realities is something you have to grasp without blinking a eye. yeah right. i suppose of one is blown to pieces, one can always replace one's mortal body with a robot, so lack of emotional control in a combatant is OK.

the logic of the story continues to deteriorate when our girl hero was given a biological copy of her lover/partner to replace his broken machine version, which in turn was created to replace his dead body.

along with some behavioral sciences, some of the old political system seem to have broken down too. is olympus a democracy? how come national decisions were made by the two women rulers alone?

While some reviewers have mentioned that the main villain is revealed late in the film, I disagree (though, yes, it is in many ways a borg ripoff).  The villain of Halcon is present throughout the movie, both literally and symbolically.  The man vs machine, individual vs collective, is what the movie is about from start to finish.  This obviously isn't the first story to tackle the subject, but it does so very ably.  It is about identity, and the struggle to retain our necessary humanity while accepting the benefits of a technological lifestyle.  It is a love story at least as much as an action flick, and that love was the hero in the identity-centered story is entirely appropriate.

A minor point.  This version is more CGI looking than Anime looking, but everything moves great.

3279618,4,B0010358CG,"Appleseed Ex Machina is the third movie in the series.  As the movies have been substantially spread apart in their realease dates, there are substantial differences in animation between them.  The second movie was a huge step up from the first, melding cinematic graphics with excellent animations.  Ex Machina takes it yet a step further:  cinematic graphics are used exclusively, with no animation.  At first I didn't think I'd care for it as much, but the characters have been infused with an even further level of development through the plot and scripting.  I was also pleased to find that the annoyance level was turned down (i.e. main character didn't yell out 'Briarios' name 300 times through the movie).  All in all, I felt this movie was a worthy installment in the Appleseed series.  Here's a brief breakdown of the movie for ease of reading....

-Graphics/Animation:  Top notch, character realism nearly rivals that of FF Advent Children.
-Music:  Heavy hitting techno tunes for the action sequences; quite pleasing
-Scripting/Voices:  Admirable job on voices and scripting, no complaints
-Plot/Character Development:  Great focus on main characters, although almost to the point of making the plot a bit hazy.  If you liked GITS storyline concepts, you'll definitely like this one; very in depth.",1210464000,2,1311,5.2105263157894735

3279620,3,B0010358CG,"The CG animation is better then ever (not cell-shaded like the last) and looks fantastic.  Shirow's art never looked so good.  The previous film though, was much better written and a lot less predictable.  Ex Machina has distinct story holes and an overly-contrived setup that makes the whole thing seem forced.  Story that should have been more developed wasn't and plot that should have been trimmed was needlessly stretched.

I enjoyed the art, as I usually do with Shirow's work, and the voice acting wasn't bad either, but don't expect a brilliant screenplay.  With the right expectations it's enjoyable for most any Otaku.",1209945600,,628,5.048543689320389
3279621,5,B0010358CG,"It seems that people either love or hate this revived anime franchise.  I for one, find myself drawn into its post-apocalyptic world of technological marvels and complex political struggles.  The emotional side of this film is much more developed than in the previous installment.  The characters' personalities and flaws are explored on a deeper and more satisfying level.  But not to worry fellow action buffs, there are still plenty of genre-defining fight sequences that take full advantage of the innovative computer assisted graphics.  The influence of the inclusion of legendary director John Woo on the project makes itself apparent in scenes of gun-slinging glory.  Anime fans, show this one to your non-believer friends for a sure convert.  The attention to detail and sophisticated graphic rendering should help displace that ""cartoons-are-for-kids"" mentality.  All-in-all, Ex Machina is a welcome amendment to the series.",1209945600,,933,5.567375886524823
3279622,2,B0010358CG,"This would've made an *excellent* shooter/RPG. The CGI is almost identical to what you see in good video games these days, and the music is on about that level.  The settings would've made for great game battles.  As a movie... well, let me give you the good and the bad:

The Good:
*Getting to see Deunan and Briareos fight as a team.  On their own, they're incredible.  Working together, they're devastating.  These two could take out half an army on their own.

* The fight scenes in general are slick and polished, at times reminiscent of ""Equilibrium"" and ""The Matrix"".

*The settings:  We're shown a bit more of Olympus, and it's high-tech, without being overwhelming.  Battle sites are appropriately menacing and--what I especially liked--flying debris/shrapnel posed an actual threat to the characters fighting, a degree of realism most anime, CGI, or even live action movies gloss over except when the plot calls for it.

*THe comraderie between the ESWAT members.  You really got the feeling they were a team *and* a dedicated branch of law enforcement.

*Glimpses of the world outside of Olympus.  Where the first movie gave us just a glimpse of the Badlands, here we had references to and characters from Poseidon.

*Bioroids acting like...well, Bioroids, as opposed to escapees from 'The Stepford Wives'.

The Bad

*The changes in voice actors.  I'm with pretty much everyone else on this.  This movie would've been better if they'd kept as much of the old English-speaking cast.  There are many familiar (to anime fans) voices in this movie, but they don't mesh well with memories of previous movies.  I especially missed Jamieson Price as Briareos.

*Changes in character design:  Athena and Nike are recognizeable only by their hair color and name.  Even Deunan's eye color looked different.  Many of the characters looked more like rubbery 'posable dolls', or wax figures.  (Especially that close-up of Deunan at the party.  She reminded me of a Barbie doll.)

*The music.  I can't say much about it, as none of it made any kind of impact on me.  It was background noise, nothing more.  It didn't even help set the mood (aside from one awful attempt at choral music at a critical moment that failed badly).

*Failure to develop current plots, much less include anything from before.
The introduction of Tereus looked promising, but they did almost nothing with him.  He looked like and often acted like Briareos, but there was no development beyond a single uncomfortable moment between himself and Deunan in a resturant.  Briareos's later outburst seemed to come out of nowhere, as there'd been no interaction between Deunan and Tereus to warrant it.  (That he'd witnessed, anyway.)  Tereus is supposed to have 'taken a shine' to Deunan, but it wasn't portrayed very well at all.  I saw very little that couldn't be called concerned professionalism.

Tereus himself was lackluster, his sole contribution to the story was that he looked like the original Briareos.  They could have used this opportunity to explore the ethics of the proposed addition to Bioroids to ESWAT, and what problems their emotional inhibitions might bring.  There could have been an opportunity for debate over the ethics of using genetic material from still-living people to create Bioroids.  (And what happened to 'all Bioroids have some of Karl's DNA in them'?)

Even more disappointing, the key element from the second movie, the result of the Appleseed data, is non-existant.  They're still growing Bioroids in vats.  While the changes in the appearance of Olympus could have easily been explained away by the fighting in the previous movie, it then makes no sense to ignore that key plot point.

Instead, we got a weak political plot, an enemy whose motivations made little sense, and a see-through conspiracy.

Overall, I can't call this a bad movie, but it's a better rental than a permanent addition to your collection, unless you are a die-hard Appleseed fan.",1209772800,7,3961,5.006134969325154

3279628,2,B0010358CG,"I felt the animation was very well done.  What brought the movie down for me were the long moments of NO ACTION filled instead with long moments of boring dialouge.  The whole ""being posessed"" idea has been done too many times before and seemed like an easy way out when it came to creating the plot for this movie.  The main character says Riorios so many times they should have put a count at the bottom of the screen.

  Long moments without any action",1208736000,,505,4.544444444444444
3279629,4,B0010358CG,"The Good:
The story was really interesting, the idea of a PDA that directly interfaces with the brain being used by a malevolent AI to control people was pretty clever, and though a little predictable, the ""twist"" at the end was nicely done. What was also pretty intriguing was the concept of what makes us who we are: Deunan experienced some truly odd feelings when she discovered that her partner, a cyborg named Briareos, had been cloned while laid out in the hospital, and the resulting Bioroid would be her new partner while Briareos was recovering. This new clone looked like and acted like her original partner before he became a cyborg, and he retained some of his knowledge of their relationship. It made for some wonderful moments of WTF. The body animation was motion captured well, and for the most part worked. What was truly amazing was the environment- The art direction and modeling on this show was spectacular, from the city sprawl and it's enormous layout, all the way down to the Landmates and their intricate detailing- utterly mind blowing.

The Bad:
The movie went along pretty smoothly until the end. Unfortunately, the third act played more like a video game than a film, complete with a floating anti-gravity fortress built with the idea of easy access, squad members who are pretty disposable and the neverending stream of bad guys who come out of an undisclosed location. If the staging weren't as good as it was, this stereotypical gamer battle might sink the film. Once again, facial animation was terrible. Also, the cleanup on the hands was pretty weak, making them feel like dead things on the end of their arms. And some of the motion captured animation made the characters jitter in the non-action segments of the piece, most noticeably during Deunans tour of the Bioroid facility and during the party. The general look of the characters was also out of place, a weird hybrid of standard cartoon anime with detailed texture maps. It gave off a vibe that the directors couldn't decide whether they wanted hyper-real or straight up cartoon, and I wish they had made a decision one way or another.

The Summary:
The movie was great. The positives outweigh the negatives enough to make it throughly awesome to watch, and because of the art direction and character development, the movie felt like it was part of a real world. Though I wish they had made some different decisions with regards to animation and the unrealistic boss battle at the end of the film, the story was strong enough to stand on its own.",1208736000,,2540,4.783599088838269

movie theater with the hi-def image and sound at their highest levels, all neatly packed
in an easy-to-store slim heafty metal case.  I thougt it looked really appealing felt nice
when you hold it in your hands.

The studio did the best they could to sustain its original quality with carefully perform-
ed the English dubs.  (Yes, I missed the original voice casts whom I liked very much
and I understand that some of the viewers commented how much they were dis-
appointed to find out the change.  Still, I was really impressed with those American/
Canadian engineers and voice actors' greate efforts and cares that had been poured
on to produce the English version, watching the surplimental materials.)

One thing that I could ask for was a documentary or commentary that showed or intro-
duced the behind-the-scene producton notes or materials, following/retracing the movie
with some interviews from the director, production staff members.

Otherwise, this is a great DVD set to purchase.",1208390400,,1649,4.89568345323741

The CG really shines in Blu-Ray, and provides some of the most life-like and vivid scenes ever encountered in an animated movie.",1208217600,,431,4.571428571428571
3279633,5,B0010358CG,"Wow, I have got to come down hard on the side that believes this is better than the (2004?) remake.

My history with this series goes back to the late 80's when the Manga came over to the USA, and then the original OVA joined from Japan. These two remakes/reimagings are quite different from the original but carry the spirit and philosophical ponderings of Masamune Shirow with them as well.

My thoughts: Appleseed (remake), the predecessor to Ex Machina had some stunning visuals however the combination of 2D and 3D art did not mesh for me. I had to get used to the downplay of philosophical/racial/political questioning which took a back seat to the action. The overall ""scope"" of the story seemed to have been collapsed.

Ex Machina (The DVD here) brought back the original's heady themes, uses a cohesive art style, and has the best characterizations of the three main characters (one of which is new). We don't quite get enough of a view into their lives, but their relationships with each other are nicely developed. This will hopefully lead to a nice continuation in the third movie.

For those who like to have something to think about, the politics are amped up in this installment and feel quite contemporary with current security states and the modern shifting boundaries between freedom in society and security.

For those who like action, there is plenty as well, including (fashionably?) zombie-likes, John Woo influenced choreography and Matrix-inspired scenes.

I highly recommend this DVD, and that means something coming from this jaded Anime and Manga fan. I can't wait for the next installment.

A side note: there is lots of shooting, but virtually no blood or gore and the language steers clear from offensiveness and foul words in the English dub. Even the dub is one of the better-quality dubs I've come across though I always recommend rewatching with the original Japanese language track and English subtitles.

3279637,4,B0010358CG,"The first Appleseed film (from 2004) was quite a treat.  The cell-shaded CG graphics looked very good for the time.  Complementing this obvious standout aspect was an intriguing story and an excellent soundtrack.  It's worth noting that the story, in particular, felt like a genuinely original re-animation of sci-fi concepts.

Fast forward to today and we have the sequel, Ex Machina.  It's pretty simple to separate what works and doesn't in Machina:

GRAPHICS:
The level of detail in the graphics has improved dramatically, and characters look less like geometric objects with textures painted on and more like genuine people.  The cityscapes are even more impressive.  Furthermore, the action is more frequent and looks even slicker.

My two gripes with the visuals are these: First, in what is all too common in action movies like this, the best scene is the first one.  Hands down.  I don't understand why so many directors feel the need to frontload their movies.  I will say that the movie is less guilty of this than its predecessor.  Second, movement outside of action scenes still looks a bit jerky.  Some might fault mo-cap technology, but for my money, Final Fantasy: Advent Children boasted some mighty believable movement.

STORY/WRITING:
Here's where Ex Machina falls apart.  The story here isn't anything you haven't seen executed better in anime/other entertainment.  Compared to the plot of the first movie- which created a unique sci-fi framework, this one felt like a filler episode.  The villain was cliche, the story far less complex/meaningful than the first, and any intrigue or mystery the story might yet have held was ruined by the horrible writing.  The film tasks itself with letting the viewer in on a number of concepts necessary to the plot, but rather than integrate them seamlessly into the dialog, it bashes the viewer over the head with them.

MUSIC:
The soundtrack wasn't bad- I just didn't notice it most of the time.  This constitutes a slight letdown considering how often I return to the soundtrack from the first movie.

OVERALL: Ex Machina is a sight to behold and warrants a blu-ray purchase.  Just don't expect it to expand much on the ideas introduced in the first Appleseed.",1207612800,31,2222,5.0109289617486334
3279638,4,B0010358CG,"Well, this movie is great but still the same animation and not a complex history. The features were GREAT and also the audio and subs options were extemely complete... this is a must.",1207612800,,183,4.575757575757576
3279639,1,B0010358CG,"I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with this. The character interactions are like something a first time writer made. Their so abysmal and disinteresting. The reactions to situations in the movie are like a bunch of teenagers. The entire character development (or lack there of) was even more disappointing then the first. The first had at least a little bit of redeeming qualities even though the dialogue was fairly weak. This movie just made me wanna change the channel if it was on tv. If you're oohed and aahed by anything flashy and shiny, you might get something from this movie. Even then I doubt it as the action sequences aren't close to the 2004 Appleseed. The fact that the voices changed was even more disappointing. Every single character was done by a different voice actor. I mean come on. To some people the voices are just voices, but to me and many others the characters' established voices were kind of like their identity. Sometimes I got lost in who was actually talking if the voice was from off screen.

Basically take Applessed 2004 and smash it to death with a baseball bat and you get Ex Machina. A bastardized version of the 2004 make. I don't know if they just got too far in the film to turn and go, ""It sucks lets start over."" But I really wish they would have just done that. Overall a movie that leaves a gross taste in my mouth. I'll be honest and say that I couldn't watch it all the way through. I couldn't really see the ridiculous characters doing, saying, being anything redeemable. If you wanna see it, find a friend who has it and laugh at him for buying it after you watch it.",1207440000,3,1638,4.496644295302014

3279643,5,B0010358CG,"My only beef with this was the ""hand of god"" scene in the end that reminded me too much of Matrix Revolutions.

That being said this is still a FANTASTIC adventure!

The story telling is done superbly.

The relationship between Briareos and Deunan is fleshed out very nicely.

The inner conflict that Briareos has between his humanity and cyborg chassis is played out very well as an external conflict with his genetic equal.

There is a lot of good to say about this film.
1) High action (you would expect from a John Woo film).
2) Close attention to details that make the world believable.
3) Story telling that compels you to watch.
4) High production quality.
5) And, a solid love story that displays integrity and loyalty for one partner. (Who could blame Deunan if she fell for Briareos's bioroid? But in the end she stayed true to what is left of the man she loves... that is a fine display of how relationships should be.)

The animation and overall production quality is even higher than the first of these done in 2004. I have to admit, I didn't realize the production quality could get better until I saw this one.

The characters have lost a bit of their ""traditional anime"" look but it really is an improvement.

I can't wait for the next installment of the ""Appleseed Saga"".",1206662400,,1288,4.569565217391304
3279644,4,B0010358CG,"Animation - Prior to Ex Machina, the previous Appleseed anime (2004) was the best Appleseed anime yet.  Unfortunately it suffered from awkward animation.  The motion capture CG looked nice until the characters began moving around.  Ex Machina fixes that for the most part.  The movements are almost as smooth as those in FFVII Advent Children.  There are still some awkward movements in this film, but only on a couple of minor parts.  John Woo's influence can be seen in the fight sequences, as well as some Matrix-type moments, but they aren't overdone.  If you are an old school John Woo fan, you'll like the small touches (doves!)...brings back memories of ""The Killer.""

Character design - The characters are very well designed and still retain an anime feel to them, not being made too realistic.  Deunan's design has changed a bit from the ""orthodox"" look, which 2004 had kept.  She has a younger and softer appearance, but it's not bad.  I like how they gave a lot of focus on Briareos, especially on his cyborg body.  His body seems more human-like like in the manga.  This is especially emphasized in his combat with other characters and his clothing.  I noticed his eyes were a different color from the 2004 anime, but that's fine...he's a cyborg; it shouldn't difficult to change the color of his ""eyes.""  Other characters, such as Hitomi, are also done very well.  The outfits, overall, were very nice.

Story elements - The story is very good.  The two main elements are: 1) relational, between Deunan and Briareos, and 2) conflict, against an antagonist who threatens the genetically-altered peace (Bioroid led world).  The relational theme is the most well done, and runs throughout the movie, bringing in a new character to help it along.  More history was given about the relationship b/n Deunan and Briareos, and explained their love for one another, which was kind of ambiguous in the past.  Briareos's character is deeper in Ex Machina, which I really appreciated.  They also did a good job of tying it in with the world crisis theme, which actually seemed to be there just to support the relational theme.  The world crisis theme was not as deep or developed, and seems to end somewhat abruptly, which is why I feel like it was just a support for the relational theme.

Overall, this is a great anime.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in Appleseed.",1206662400,2,2382,4.807881773399015
3279645,5,B0010358CG,"definitely worth having in the collection. i'm not even an anime or big comic movie fan, but this was unique. i rewound so many scenes because they looked so cool. i rented this from netflix on SD format, but can't wait to get the HD-DVD format!",1206403200,,245,4.3478260869565215
3279646,3,B0010358CG,"We get a decent story, but what the heck happened to the characters? First off, the voice actors have been changed for a number of characters. This is more an issue with the dub, but the sub also has some key characters with changed voices. To add to this we have characters with complete personality changes and even major appearance changes. While we never got a real good look at Briareos before he became a cyborg in the last movie, we got enough of a look to know that how he is represented in this movie looks completely different.

This movie is also too dependent on cheesy and flashy action sequences. Heck, the movie opens with an action sequence and once that ends and we move on to the next scene we're pretty much thrown in to yet another completely separate action sequence. We understand that these guys know what they're good at, but developing the story would be kinda nice.

Once the story gets going it isn't that bad, although weaker than the previous movie in my opinion. It seems to exist simply as a means of find excuse after excuse to show action scenes rather than existing to tell a good story.

The animation itself, and the appearance of the characters especially, is far better in this version than the previous one. The action scenes, while over the top and a bit tiring, are still great to watch and are really what makes the movie worth watching. This movie is like ""Advent Children"" in that it seems to exist simply to show a lot of action and flash. The main difference is that the action in this one is worth sitting through the faults for.

The voice acting, despite being different, isn't that bad. I feel they should have kept the actors the same for the sequel, but you get used to them for the most part. The music is pretty standard and not quite up to the level of the last one, but still decent enough, especially considering it wasn't that notable in the first film.

All in all it's great for action, but when it comes to the story and how it performs as a sequel, it was honestly a disappointment. If you like Appleseed it's worth viewing, but I wouldn't set your expectations to high if you're expecting anything other than a lot of flash and little substance.",1206316800,3,2208,4.4689826302729525
3279647,4,B0010358CG,"Appleseed Ex Machina is a sequel to 2004's Appleseed; produced by John Woo and directed by Shinji Aramaki, the duo comes with an entertaining futuristic thriller adapted from the manga by Shirow Masamune (Ghost in the Shell). The revolutionary CGI animation is astonishing, combined with awesome action sequences reminiscent of John Woo movies, Appleseed Ex Machina looks very promising. Thankfully, you do not need to see the 2004 film to appreciate and comprehend this new film's premise. The plot itself lacks depth, it is so predictable that everything is laid out for the viewer; this animated feature is more about CGI and action than anything else. It definitely feels to be geared to international audiences than to Shirow's native land.

The year is 2133, civilization is recovering from the global war that almost devastated the world. Utopian cities are on the rise, technological advancements are dominating the world and humans have a fresh new attitude to match their new surroundings. Cyborgs are very common, machine parts are used to replace severed limbs and body parts. Bioroids are being cloned from humans to use as soldiers that lack human emotion and violent tendencies that often get humanity in trouble. Quoted as "" incapable of hate and anger, will only fight and kill when absolutely necessary..."" or are they? The passive bioroids are intended to keep order so that the world can maintain the peace without the hostile influences of hatred and rage.
Special forces specialist Deunan and Briareos are partners from the days that Briareos was human. Briareos is a special case, since he is the only human being who managed to survive being 100% cyborg without going insane. When Briareos was injured (or damaged), he becomes replaced by Tereus, a bioroid cloned from his human DNA.
When an unknown enemy plans a stealth attack by reducing common folk into technological zombies who turn the city into a war zone, the trio must settle their differences to quell this threat.

Appleseed isn't as bad as I first thought it would be. Renowned action scribe John Woo definitely showed his hand with most (not all) of the action sequences. The action is visually stylish and definitely looks cool. Woo's usual gimmicks are omnipresent in the proceedings; bike stunts, stylish bullet ballet and helter skelter action sequences are what's in store for the viewer. ""Ex machina"" also has the same mecha action in its previous installment. The film definitely feels like it is geared towards an specific audience and therefore lost some of the atmosphere and depth that contemporary sci-fi anime has been known for. ""Ex Machina"" is about the action, it is a straightforward film with one-dimensional antagonists with motivations completely predictable and something that has been  done through the years.

The emotional aspect of Deunan and Briareos' relationship is quite interesting and serves as the film's main premise. Despite the fact that Deunan has kept her humanity and Briareos has lost 85% of his body, their commitment and love for each other remains strong. However, their relationship is thrown into a loop when Tereus gets into the mix, since he is a clone from Briareos human DNA. Yes, there is a bit of a sappy love triangle here that has the same elements that we've all seen before.

The animation is quite good. The film sidesteps the usual anime style and effectively combines modern and contemporary anime. The backdrops are astounding and definitely catches the architecture of the future. The characters look almost photorealistic without the usual ""over expressive, super fair complexioned characters. Deunan is rendered to look like a lethal but sexy woman, with the designer, Prada taking a hand in one of her outfits. The graphics are definitely an improvement over the 2004 film, but still falls short to the quality of ""Final Fantasy Advent Children"" and ""Biohazard:Degeneration"".

Appleseed Ex Machina is overall a success I suppose. Fans of the 2004 film will definitely appreciate this sequel and newer fans will be impressed. I'm not saying that this film should be your first experience with anime, there are definitely more worthy titles than this film. This film is more about entertainment and not the usual philosophical and existential fare that contemporary Japanese Anime has been famous for. It fell into the usual plot holes and predictability that is so reminiscent of animated films geared for a younger audience. It is a popcorn movie more than anything else. APPLESEED Ex MACHINA is good but NOT essential.

3279649,4,B0010358CG,"Lets start from the top..
The case this movie comes in is insanely nice- high definition printing-gloss metallic shine on aluminum and it's a book styled case-in fact its exactly the same type of case that the Gits SCC special edition movie came in...disk one contains the movie and some extras, disk two contains a ""definitive history of Appleseed""..and some art doc about anime..i tend to find that while the ""history"" is very cool the rest of it is rather useless..I would have preferred some sort of enhanced soundtrack disk..also whats cool about this package is that you get a mini Appleseed Dark Horse comic. Very cool!

Story mechanics:
Story wise I would like to think that Exmachina is like the episode 2 of the first movie that was left out...sorta... cause it just kind of starts...not like the massive entrance sequence from the first...Now overall once it gets moving its actually rather quite solid...once thing leads to another..and the story makes actual sense...unlike in the previous movie where it was one chop after another.. Although while its solid there are elements of it that are direct copies from other movies and it's a blatant. The giant floating announcement ship with digital signs: Blade Runner, The ""swarm"" of flying drones and there behavior- Matrix Revolutions, ""we are all one""-Star Trek Voyager.. And the list goes on and on and on...I mean were talking over 40% of story is ripped from other media...BUT even with all of this the mix seems very unique and futuristic ..its just not that original ..but flipside wise it  also matches the Appleseed universe pretty well. This Story is also more mature than the previous story line..much in the way that Second Gig was a major mature shift for the Gits Franchise- death, cussing, terrorists, murder, riots, and plenty of  violence..Although all in all its entertaining and yes the story has depth to it...finally!

Graphics:  MASSIVE upgrade from the first movie...very well thought out...Tons of awesome camera work...for anime its right up there with Ergo Proxy and Advent when it comes to shear graphics capability..the animation is also far more detailed...its right on par with the times..and OH YEA TONS OF ACTION!!! gotta hand it to Woo and Aramaki...pretty good!!

Voice: American voice cast is top notch!!!!..they all sound very intense and the lines are pretty good..granted some are cheesy

The one thing I loved the most about Ex Machina was the voice acting (eventhough the timing was a bit off at times). It has been done perfectly, right on top with the likes of FullMetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell. Luci Christian (although I am not too fond of her) does a wonderful job as Deunan, BTW you may remember her a Kaname Chidori from Full Metal Panic.

A new character, Tereus bring a fresh look to the cast. You can view him as the human part of Briareos. I, sometimes, felt that director Shinji Aramaki could have dwelled more into Deunan's and Briareos's romance (same thing with the first movie). Battle scenes are awesome, as expected from John Woo. Character models look like plastic barbies sometimes, but other times, they will blow your brains out.

Although, people will view this sequel as just a fan service to the original movie, I believe it is definitely worthy of being added to your anime collection. I cannot say anything about its DVD counterpart, but Appleseed: EX Machina (Blu-ray) on a 46"" Bravia played on a PS3 with 5.1 surround sound at 1080p will make you wonder if there is anything else better in life.",1206057600,4,1414,4.537254901960784

The first movie was an acceptable (see: pretty and light) but standard anime, relying heavily on its look to distinguish itself. The cg in Ex Machina is far superior, the animation has improved quite a bit, and the storytelling is much more streamlined. Exposition is definitely there, just like the first, but the pacing is way superior. Sure, its got a lot of nonsense science, but any fan of anime in general will find something here. It's got stuff to appeal to girls and boys and in blu-ray it looks freakin' amazing. A great purchase, and a visual contender with heavyweights Beowulf and Final Fantasy TSW in the cg category.

Pros +
+ More Briarios
+ Improved English Voice Acting Dramatically
+ Better Pacing
+ Amazing Visual Quality and Sound

- English dialogue sync has an iffy moment or two

3279663,3,B0010358CG,"The producers of EX MACHINA have robbed Appleseed of its uniqueness and given us something that resembles a video game cut-scene.  The shiny cell shading that made the previous film so visually appealing is completely gone.  Everything looks like it's made of rubbery plastic and the people look and move like dolls.  Deunan's cute anime look has been removed.  Her eyes are much smaller and her lips are too thin.  The corners of her mouth are turned down much of the time, giving her an odd pouty look.  Briareos now has green ""eyes"" instead of red.  The streets are no longer paved with reflective material and the vehicles, for the most part, move on tires rather than hovering.  The city of Olympus has only one mirrored dome rather than two.  Furthermore, the music is nothing special.  There are no Boom Boom Satellites or Paul Oakenfold tunes to accentuate the action.  The English voices are all different and the dialogue is peppered with profanity.  Yet, much of the commentary track is devoted to telling viewers how ""rushed"" the 2004 version was and how much better this version is.  And the features on the bonus disc are devoted to telling us how great anime is, despite the fact that this sequel has been stripped of all its anime-ness.  Sorry guys, EX MACHINA is okay, but the first movie was not broke and therefore should not have been fixed.  Simply put, if you loved Appleseed 2004, you will most likely be disappointed with this effort.",1205539200,18,1458,4.73015873015873
3279664,3,B0010358CG,"When i first heard about this release i was very happy to find out that it was going to be released in blu-ray, and given the first Appleseed Movie(conventional animation) i expected this one to have the same intense gripping action scenes and storyline. How dissapointed i was when i watch the whole movie, it literally bored me to death with the weak plot and lackluster action sequences, if it weren`t for the beautiful visuals and stunning CGI effects of this movie(first by anime standards on blu-ray) i would have given this movie a 1 star. There was not enough action and drama to keep you excited, the story was shallow and simple and the voice acting was mediocre, even the climax of the movie was pretty lame. Overall this movie is a must have for hardcore fans only, if not you be better off renting it from Blockbuster or Netflix(if they have it) or just buying the dvd version which is alot cheaper than the blu-ray edition. I wish they should just have released FFVII: Advent Children on blu-ray instead of this, i would have been alot happier.",1205452800,,1058,4.603174603174603
3279665,2,B0010358CG,"Truly disappointing in so many ways it's hard to know where to start.
Dialogue - The worst aspect of this movie is the unbelievably horrible dialogue; so bad it will make you cringe.
Story - As others have noted, you get the feeling there were multiple writers for the story and they kept getting fired and only using half of the previous writers work; a few almost interesting points are brought up in the movie and then abandoned before they can be explored.  It should also be noted that the movie steals (without adding or improving) quite a lot from other movies, the matrix, the borg cube, etc.
Animation - While it's admittedly a nice clean HD transfer, the actual CG animation used looks like it's from one of the straight-to-video Barbie movies; half the time the characters move in a very unnatural, stilted way.

My recommendation:  instead of purchasing this, just watch the previous Appleseed movie again, it wasn't that great either, but much better than this.",1205452800,5,974,4.785714285714286
3279666,1,B0010358CG,"I hate this DVD.  Ok why do I hate it?

The story is all over the place, it seems like several people worked on the story and threw a final version together.  Also the story does not follow any of Mr. Shirow's original books, which is a shame since his original story is such an Excellent original mix of CyberPunk and Greek mythology. I wonder if the movie writers read the original stories at all!

 The Animation quality is not up to the standard of the first movie.  The characters are not rendered is the same beautiful style of the first DVD. It is close, but it is different.

One Star. There are alot of cool Mech models in this the 2nd Appleseed DVD movie.  And the city models and sets are also quite awesome.

If you are expecting a SHIROW Appleseed movie, forget it, it's not here.

Very disappointed!",1205366400,3,813,4.36
3279667,5,B0010358CG,"I like the film because the graphics were a better improvement than the first not that the first was bad in the first place. The story was a little more creative that the original because the first part was a little more slower paced in the begining (Not including the intro)and picked up more in the middle. While this one picked up more quicker in the begining keeps you in the suspense till the end. The voice acting i felt was a better improvement than the original as well.

Is this movie worth buying? Yes

Will it be better than the original? Yes

Go get it and watch it you won't regret it. And for those who hated the first and writes that the sequel sucked. My reply is why did you see it in the first place if you hated the first? Leave the reviews to the ones who like the first.",1205366400,,791,4.1568627450980395
3279668,2,B0010358CG,"Appleseed E.M. -
This movie's cell-shaded style provides tons of eye candy for Appleseed fans.  The CGI effects are excellent except when it comes to the animation of body movement and character interaction in non-action scenes.  I'm not sure if it's the affects of the CGI cell-shading or if it's by design (cuz it seems rather glaring to me), but the characters seem to move like plastic dolls.  There are scenes in which human flesh is depicted to come in contact with metallic cyborgs (such as the scenes between Deunan and Briareros), but because of the clunky animation of the bodies and the seemingly unresponsive physical contact between characters, I miss out on the emotional conflict of what it must be like to be in love with a machine. The action gun-fight sequences are outrageous, but that is to be expected with John Woo at the helm of production.  Personally, I don't mind the over-the-top flipping, looping, twisting, whirling gun fights.  Those scenes are fun to watch, for me.  Buildings, scenery, character models, and vehicle CGI are top-notch.  Overall, most people would be the animation style of Appleseed E.M.

Now what I don't like,(perhaps this is due to the nature of Animes in general) is how little things just don't make any sense.  For instance, in the first action scene, Deunan (the main female protagonist) launches a flash bomb into small group of terrorist before the order to attack was given.  I understand a part of that scene was to illustrate she's an independent and strong woman not privy to the command of others at times...but the flash bomb really didn't provide any additional advantage to the ESWAT attack. Did I miss something?  Why did she throw that flash grenade and jeopardize the entire mission?  Then, after the scene in which Briareros grabs Deunan and jumps out of the chapel window, one of the ESWAT member holds her back from running to his body. Why couldn't she run to his body? Perhaps I'm too nit-picky, but for anyone who is like me, this ruins a movie.  I would have given the movie at least a 4 were it not for those bits of the storyline which left a bad taste for me.",1205366400,,2137,4.712365591397849
3279669,5,B0010358CG,"What a cool flick, much better than Appleseed 2004. Great actions sequences it has John Woo written all over it. It even has some scenes from the Matrix trilogy. See it in HD my friends, beautiful vivid picture.",1205366400,5,211,4.578947368421052
3279670,5,B0010358CG,"Ok, first of all, if you're not an anime-fan, you'd feel a bit lost on what's the big deal with this.
If you don't know Shirow Masamune, then you'd definitely feel lost.

If you know John Woo and had followed his work...then this will catch your attention. thumbsup.gif
Imagine, Mission Impossible 2, Face Off, Hard Boiled, A Better Tomorrow 1,2,3, The Killer, Once a Thief and Hard Target in animation.

If you like The Matrix cyberpunk story, this is for you, except its not dark to hide its flaws. This movie actually celebrates details. And details are abound in here. Even if its a close up in the eyes, the mouth, the lips, the jawlines.

If your a gamer that starves into details; who spends $500 on a videocard so you can see the textures of those leaves in Crysis, then this movie is definitely for you. This movie does not cut any corners in textures and details. If a character is wearing a leather jacket, you'll see leather. The CGs in this movie is tremendous. I've seen it twice in a 24hr-span I'm still seeing things I've never noticed in the beginning. The motion capture technology is simply amazing.

Ok, but does it have a story?

Does Jason and the Argonauts have an interesting story?
Is it really ground breaking? When Gene Roddenberry introduce the communicator, he brought in the cellphone.
Shirow Masamune introduced a theory in sci-fi, brings a story into this, but continues by illustrates it also.
It tackles a love story, technology available now and the future, politics, ethics, ideology, and the dilemma that each brings into the story. If you look closely at the armor protections, paddings and vest, you'll see them in current Blackhawk vest, and those riot gears worn by cops worldwide. Even the the FN PN-90 resembles one of the Seburo PDW

With all talks about eye-candy, then maybe perhaps this is a guy movie. The hero in this movie is a woman.
The people in power are women. The women here are powerful in the sense of strength, character, and conviction.
This Matrix with Trinity as the center of the movie.

Is this a date movie? Was Open Water a date movie? I thought so, since it deals with emotions on both the joy that a relationship brings and the love of separation, of acceptance. Bioroids/synthetic body parts/cyborgs may seem cold, but the emotions in each character are delivered. Despite one of the major character, Briareos Hecatonchires faceless facade, his body language are enough to say or deliver his lines.
There are topics that discusses the nature of being a human vs a clone. Would you continue to have feeling towards someone who is a clone? Would you let someone go to save your own?
I bet the ladies will notice the style and textures differently from guys.
The guys in these forum will love the shooting gallery scene

Shirow Masamune's mind something to be admired and ponder. Here he writes a story about the future, yet he discuss are slavery towards technology like the Bluetooth earpiece. I know ppl who seems to sleep, shower, and have sex with a Bluetooth earpiece. Politically, he shares the idea a utopia where everything flows like clockwork and smoothly, yet vulnerable to terrorism, as we are now. He brings the technology in medicine that allows us to continue life and existence, yet prone to the devices that makes the delicate-geniuses-in lab coats criminally insane.
