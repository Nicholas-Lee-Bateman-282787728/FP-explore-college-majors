6791724,4,B00PBDRO7S,"This movie was pretty good.  It did leave me asking a few questions of the parents of these kids when I watched it.  All in all I did enjoy it.  Jason Gedrick was great as always, just not in the movie enough.  I would recommend it for a family night film.",1422403200,2,256,3.9607843137254903

8687275,2,B00PBDRO7S,"Skating to New York is kind of a strange film.  It starts and ends with some decent hockey action because the main characters are hockey players.  Things at home aren't working out to great for them, so they decide to skate across the lake from Canada to New York.  It is very apparent early that none of them are even remotely prepared for the journey, but still they do it.  They have struggles both internal and external, amongst themselves and with nature and eventually, well, it's sort of inevitable what will happen.

The strangest thing isn't how woefully under prepared any of the kids are, but the few moments late on in their journey.  One incident involving some smugglers completely kills any believability in the events and the one kid who ends up partly in the lake apparently suffers no ill effects, an event I find highly unlikely (along with none of them potentially going snow blind, but that's another issue) even though they get him into dry clothes swiftly.  The journey is more about having something to call their own and finding their own inner strength.  It's a fairly cliche arc for this type of coming-of-age film.  I never once had a sense that anyone was ever truly in danger, though, and that would have made for a more compelling film than what was presented.  At least it's got a quick hour and a half run time.",1432598400,,1344,4.609243697478991

8687278,3,B00PBDRO7S,"This movie was just okay, nothing spectacular. I think the idea was good, but too much boring stuff in it. I watched it only because Jason Gedrick was in it as the father of the kid.........",1427760000,,190,4.305555555555555
8687279,1,B00PBDRO7S,Bad script. BAd acting. Bad music. Ugh.,1424736000,,39,4.714285714285714
