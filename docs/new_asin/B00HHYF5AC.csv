6165650,5,B00HHYF5AC,"Although we have enjoyed books and games from Leap Frog, The Letter Machine Rescue Team DVD was our first experience watching the show and I was so thoroughly impressed!

First of all, my daughter said she had no interest in watching this. So I put it on to watch myself and the instant it started, her head spun around and she dropped to the floor and was mesmerized for the entire DVD. The colors are so bright and bold I even noticed my infant son staring at the screen.

I heard the word adjective in the first couple minutes and was actually a little bit shocked. I have watched literally hundreds of DVDs and shows promising to be educational but normally that just consists of the alphabet and colors and shapes or something. This had those things too but much more complex things as well. Never have I seen a show explaining adjectives and consonant blends which is exactly what my Kindergartener is learning in school. Only this makes it more fun!

I think they both thought based on the cover that this was a show for really little toddlers and I actually did too. But it was actually perfect for both my four and six year olds and spoke to them on their level AND educated them in ways they could understand and relate to.

Leap Frog: The Letter Machine Rescue Team DVD was educational enough to thrill me and fun and entertaining enough to hook my kids and have them begging for more as soon as it ended! I will definitely be making Leap Frog DVDs a part of our library!",1395187200,5,1482,4.417582417582418
6165651,3,B00HHYF5AC,"Well, we are big leapfrog fans. My children have gone through the leap reader, leap pad, leapster, leapster explorer and have all the leapfrog movies, and even some of the workbooks cd's etc. we love them.  I wouldn't say its awful, but perhaps not what I expected. The letter machine rescue team feels more like an introduction to some concepts, not so much as can be used as part of curriculum or to teach but feels like more of just an introduction.  For example my oldest learned the alphabet and sounds from the letter factory. When we purchased the lets go to school dvd which came with a cd for the car, the kids learned The days of the week and months of the year. We later played the cd to introduce and reinforce skip counting by 2,5,10. Learned to count from another etc. I was very excited to purchase this video. My child was going over blends in school and  I guess when I saw ""teaches blends"" I assumed it was going to go over the common blends and teach the basic blends with  creativity and or a song or something. However this was not the case. It was a sing along song,, blends are friends.. and it maybe shows a few during the video but not actually teaching them, as most of the song just sings"" blends, blends are friends"".. not what I expected.
Of course I don't just teach my children from videos, but from previous videos they are so creative and with the songs children learn much faster and in a more fun way than from just lessons or worksheets..  Seems like touches certain concepts and introduces them but that's about it,, its just an introduction.",1394496000,30,1579,4.431034482758621

6165654,2,B00HHYF5AC,Not what I expect from Leapfrog.  If you have the Talking words Factory and the Letter Factory you will be disappointed with this one.  It is nowhere near the quality of those two videos.  I am definitely disappointed.,1394150400,14,218,4.684210526315789

Definitely a little advance but she loves it anyways. I like that this one is animated and not cartoony like all the other leap frog DVD's we have. Love the songs too.",1398211200,,292,4.232142857142857
6165797,5,B00HHYF5AC,"My kids loved this movie as much as the original Letter Factory and was a great follow up to the first DVD.  If you are expecting an exact remake of the original Letter Factory, this is not it.  Rather, it introduces parts of speech and other phonics concepts.  As with all of our Leap Frog videos, my kids ask for this one over and over again.",1396396800,,344,4.181818181818182
6165798,5,B00HHYF5AC,"It's about time that LeapFrog updated their DVDs from graphical animation to computer animation.  The picture is so much 3D like, and it looks much clearer.

6165800,3,B00HHYF5AC,"I was looking forward to this DVD since my children love everything Leapfrog especially The Letter Factory DVD. I cannot praise Letter Factory enough. I cannot say the same for this video. It seems it covers many concepts in a short time but does not explain them. As an adult, I appreciate the CGI. Its easier to watch and the songs are catchy but my children did not like it. They watched it once and haven't shown interest in it again. I rented it first to try it out but this is one DVD I won't be buying right now.",1395705600,7,519,4.2

8632903,5,B00HHYF5AC,"After my son watched the video twice and we sang with him during he knew his sounds.

He was in pre-k and he knew his letters but was having trouble with sounds and just didn't have the confidence but this helped..

We bought one for a friend and said her daughter caught on so fast and she is a year younger",1514937600,,308,4.032786885245901

8632906,5,B00HHYF5AC,"My son LOVES this show. Leap Frog usually knocks the ball out of the park with their educational shows. My boy has enjoyed watching this since he was 4 in PreK, to this day at age 6 graduating Kindergarten. It just doesn't get old with him! High recommend for learning letters and early learners.",1496534400,,296,4.5
8632907,5,B00HHYF5AC,"As always with Leap Frog, love the learning that it provides for the kids. They are highly engaged as they watch and learn as they go!",1494720000,,134,4.1923076923076925
8632908,5,B00HHYF5AC,Leap frog products are excellent.  I especially love Letter Factory.,1493251200,,68,5.8
8632909,2,B00HHYF5AC,"The talking words and talking letters factory are old school animated. The picture isn't so clear on new TVs. Big deal. They are great learning videos and the 4yo loves them and quotes them all the time. He actually yelled at this one and got frustrated. The machine ""breaks"" and they are all trying to fix it, and end up singing a song that really has no purpose. He wanted to know why they were singing and wasting time instead of fixing the machine.

So that's a kid's take on it.  This one has more of that Disney channel vibe, with computer animated characters and everyone sounds like they did lines of coke before recording it, and it all is super extreme to the max mountain dew commercial awesomeness. The plot even involves skateboards. As if they had a list of things to use to make it ""cool.""

If you and your kid watch the regular kids TV I'm sure this is fine. If you subscribe to the slower, gentler, Mr rogers and pbs kids shows, stick to the old leap frog DVDs.",1478131200,,978,4.333333333333333
