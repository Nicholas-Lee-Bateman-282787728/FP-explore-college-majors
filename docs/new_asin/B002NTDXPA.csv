8375360,5,B002NTDXPA,"excellent audio and video, focus on all players, capturing I'm guessing the entire concert.
great playing as usual by Bill and everyone, a real treat.
Too bad this isn't the stuff shown on PBS, Austin City Limits, ect.",1381449600,,218,4.7631578947368425
8375361,5,B002NTDXPA,"The music on this concert recording is very laid back and groovy. The playing is highly collective - and the different instruments blend perfectly - yet with distinct and impressing solos, especially from Bill Frisell and Ron Miles. I first heard clips from the concert on You Tube and later on a TV-recording from some japanese station. This DVD is much better both with regard to audio and video quality and without mixing music and interviews. Please note that the DVD is identical to ""Live in Montreal"". Highly recommended!",1293494400,,527,4.932584269662922
8375362,5,B002NTDXPA,"I'm a big Ginger Baker fan and found Frisell and Charlie Hayden through him.
I can't say enough about Mr. Frisell's sound. So very tasty and the people
he plays with are huge talants. I purchased two of these and turned a friend
on to him. My friend is a very big Zappa fan and guitar player. Bill is now
his new hero. Two Thumbs, 5 Stars, ""Buy It""",1270252800,,348,4.057971014492754
8375363,5,B002NTDXPA,"Frisell at his best. The band is on fire. I love Ron Miles participation here. This is typical Frisell where he shows to other guitar players out there that the sound of the whole is more important than ""impressive"" solos. Now showing off here just EXCELLENT music.",1269388800,4,265,4.659574468085107
8375364,5,B002NTDXPA,"What would I have wanted to know before purchasing this DVD?  I would want to know that the DVD is enjoyable from an audio-visual perspective, and that it is entertaining, and that the music is good.  The video is good quality and it shows the different musicians when they solo or as they are performing.  The performers include:  Bill Frisell (guitar and loops), Matt Chamerlain (drums), Billy Drewes (alto saxophone), Curtis Fowlkes (trombone), Greg Leisz (steel guitars and mandolin), Ron Miles (trumpet), and David Plitch (bass)  The director is Pierre Seguin.  I cannot tell who the cameramen are but I'd say they did a great job.  The songs are a variety of Frisell's work over the years - but with this line-up the fans will know to expect more of the jazzy angle than the Americana angle, although with Greg Leisz there is certainly some of that.  In any case, I've been a fan since I heard the soundtrack to The Far Side that aired on Fox in 1994 or 1995, and ever since I've bought pretty much everything I can find with Bill Frisell on it.  And this DVD is definitely awesome, because some of the songs are from the Quartet album that had some of the Far Side songs on it.  But it has some newer songs too.  For some reason the box doesn't say where this was recorded.  Looks like an intimate jazz festival type venue...in any case, I am very happy with my purchase.  Great sound and fun to watch!",1263859200,13,1409,4.5
