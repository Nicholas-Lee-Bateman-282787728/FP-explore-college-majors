5886437,5,B00E1S1MMM,"Vega did a great job portraying Latin American social classes. It reminded me of many different characters I have met before. He adds a special Cantinflas style scene, which brings back good memories.",1377648000,3,200,5.090909090909091

5886439,4,B00E1S1MMM,"I really enjoyed this film and laughed out loud a number of times. The dialogue is very clever, as is the satire of life among the Mexican wealthy. The version I saw was in Spanish with English subtitles. The subtitles were very accurate and easy to read. It does have quite a bit of profanity and for that reason I would not recommend it for children.",1375228800,15,352,4.348484848484849

5886445,3,B00E1S1MMM,Don't have much to say really. Bought this for my wife and it simply doesn't play in any of our blu ray players... Samsung/ps4/xbox1/sharp/PC.  Tried them all no luck.  No region locks or setting that would prohibit it playing. They simply have static/freeze. Wife simply wanted to watch the movie ASAP so I finally found a digital version for sale at another site with code to redeem and that works.,1433894400,,400,4.7

5886448,3,B00E1S1MMM,"The product description specifically said that this disc offered subtitles in Spanish.  IT DOES NOT OFFER SUBTITLES IN SPANISH.  It's a predictable and formulaic story, but it is very well done and very enjoyable.  I am learning Spanish and I hoped to watch with Spanish subtitles to facilitate my learning.
If you're looking for a fun movie, this is a fun movie.  If, like me, you're looking for a Spanish language learning tool within a good movie you may end up disappointed like I am.",1430524800,2,488,4.705882352941177

5886465,5,B00E1S1MMM,"Since I speak Spanish I really have a good time, u enjoy a movie better in its original language. Gonzalo Vega is an excellent actor and in this movie performs just great. It's worth watching it spend a few bucks and enjoy the show . Bought it from ""Epoca de oro"" if I'm not wrong great price and fast shipping.",1396051200,,311,4.2

5886467,5,B00E1S1MMM,"This is a great comedy, especially if you grew up in Mexico or in Latin America/Spain. The humor is fantastic all the way to the extras in the DVDs. The movie is very well executed and is always entertaining. We had a great time watching it. Highly recommended",1395273600,,260,4.4375
5886468,5,B00E1S1MMM,"Mexican cinema unfortunately has a reputation for producing terrible low-budget movies. However, every once in a while a nice little diamond in the rough is found, as is the case with Nostros Los Nobles. This movie was fantastic. I'll try and not spoil the movie but will provide some insight.

The movie is in spanish but has english sub-titles. The translation to english seems to be spot on, a few phrases would have been reworded differently but they work alright. The titles sometimes shows money figures, for example $80. That figure shown represent the US Dollar $ amount while in spanish the film mentions Mexican Pesos.

Keep in mind the rivalry the between Puebla and Mexico City, they are very close together. Kind of like Boston and New York, they are rivals. Also, the rivalry or unique relationship between spain and mexico. Spaniards and mexicans.

In mexico there is very little middle class as we know it in the usa. The rich can be very elite. The poor tend to be, well poor, consider them hard working and willing to do what ever it takes to survive and try to advance in life. Mexico doesn't offer the poor the same opportunities as the USA offers it's poor. Think welfare, food stamps, medical care, etc. Regardless of economic class the mexican people will always try to have a good time and enjoy love to the fullest regardless of their situation.

Well, I hope this info helps you enjoy this movie.",1393200000,2,1422,4.698795180722891

5886472,3,B00E1S1MMM,"The quality of the cover is pretty bad.  It makes the item look like a ""knock off"". However, the DVD (the quality of the image) is quite good. I think that for how it was prices, the quality of the cover itself should be much better. Had it been, the rating would have been higher.  This is my only complaint... the quality -or lack there of- of the cover.

The film is very good, however. I am happy with my purchase.",1385337600,2,418,4.135802469135802

I watched the version in Spanish with Spanish subtitles so my hubby could follow the dialogue because he says he cannot understand ""Chilango"". It was funny to see that the actual dialogue did not match the subtitles but it didn't bother my, i just found it amusing.",1383782400,3,409,4.324675324675325
