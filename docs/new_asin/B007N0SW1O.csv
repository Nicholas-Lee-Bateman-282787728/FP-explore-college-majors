8519582,5,B007N0SW1O,"The two featured compositions; the Emperor Concerto and Scheherazade receive super duper performances.  I can easily say that this is my new favorite Emperor.  Yefim Bronfman gives a real muscular rendition of the piano parts and shows togetherness with Nelsons; a new and vital addition to the role of baton masters.  The  members of the Concertgebow give a stellar account of Rimskys popular musical tale.  All in all, buy and enjoy a stunning new dvd.",1426982400,,454,5.0
8519583,5,B007N0SW1O,"Having watched this disc a few times now, I have asked myself why I keep coming back to it.

My reasons:

1) Nelsons' conducting. His joy in the music is vividly on display. Occasionally he tucks away his baton and lets his hands do the work; sometimes he uses his entire body. His face registers determination when the music is stern and lights up with a smile when it is effusive. His bond with the orchestra is fully evident, and they clearly appreciate him as well. During the final ovations he insists that everyone on stage have their moment to bask in the applause.

2) The playing of the Concertgebouw, in ensemble and as soloists. What a sound, both in tutti and when the first-chair players have their moments in the spotlight. In this performance I could see how Scheherazade is a lot like a ""concerto for orchestra"". Beautiful colors. It must be a lot of fun to play.

3) The video direction. The camerawork in this production is phenomenal. We get to see each soloist as they are featured in the score, with effortless shifts of perspective. I can't remember the last time I saw a filmed concert where the orchestra members were showcased as much, or more, than the conductor, who all too often in these productions is the uncontested ""star"" no matter what piece is featured (*cough* *cough* Dudamel). The camerawork here serves the music first and foremost, highlighting how beautifully it is scored and taking us on a visual journey to accompany the sound. One thing for sure, it made me give far more credit to Rimsky-Korsakov as a composer than I'd allowed before.

4) The video quality. State-of-the-art HD. What more do I need to say.

5) Sound quality. Also top-notch.

6) The interpretations. Last but certainly not least, this disc features outstanding interpretations of both the Concerto and Scheherazade. I suppose that given the pedigree of the Concertgebouw and the artistry of Nelsons I should have expected nothing less, but having been disappointed by ""name brands"" in the past I have learned to wait and see.

I know I haven't had much to say about Bronfman or the Beethoven. Bronfman does a great job here -- I don't want to discount it. He makes the titanic Beethoven Concerto No. 5 seem effortless. It is an appealing and exhilarating appetizer before a sumptuous main course.

I would like to lend my copy of this disc to friends, but I've wanted to watch it so many times now that I'm afraid to let it out of my sight. It's a truly uplifting concert experience that seems to be exactly what a ""festival"" performance should be, and how a filmed musical event should be enjoyed in one's own home.

If you're a fan of these pieces, especially the R-K, I can't recommend this disc highly enough.",1404086400,3,2727,4.674321503131524
8519584,5,B007N0SW1O,"Andris Nelsons is superb!  I can't wait to see and hear more from him.  Bronfman does a very fine job, as does the orchestra.",1402876800,,125,4.166666666666667
8519585,4,B007N0SW1O,"The conductor, soloist and orchestra are superb. I look forward to his conducting the Boston Symphony next year. Very exciting to watch too.",1370649600,,140,5.130434782608695
8519586,4,B007N0SW1O,"This concert was the second of two featuring the Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Andris Nelsons and was held at the Lucerne Festival in September 2011.

The program features three major works which together make for a very satisfying program. The concert opens with a performance of Beethoven's Ruins of Athens Overture and which clearly displays Nelson's conducting style as being physically very involved with the music making of the players. It is easy to see why his obvious enthusiasm would encourage considerable levels of commitment from the players and why he has attained such prominence at such a young age.

The opening of the concert brings a steady performance of the overture which is markedly slower than either Beecham or Zinman taking two examples on CD from different performing generations for comparison. This preference for slower tempi is also apparent in Scheherazade. This a consequence of Nelson's tendency to linger lovingly over expressive phrases and a desire to bring out a considerable amount of orchestral detail. Admirable though this may well be, and certainly interestingly revealing, the result is to change the character of what is normally a show-piece full of excitement with high levels of adrenaline. As a result, those purchasers essentially looking for emotional fire such as can be found in Reiner's famous CD performance for example, where the final movement was reputably recorded in one scorching take, will not find it here! What they will find though is beautiful playing and a loving performance which may well suit the character of Scheherazade and her intended as opposed to the content of her story material.

On the other hand, Bronfman delivers one of the finest performances of the Beethoven 5th concerto on DVD/Blu-ray and is easily the equal of either Barenboim or Buchbinder on their discs of the complete Beethoven piano concertos and is very similar to his own CD interpretation with Zinman. By contrast with either the overture or Scheherazade, the pace is crisply maintained and as usual, Bronfman displays a complete mastery of touch and phrasing leading to much incidental variety without sacrificing drama or forward movement. It may be significant that his exciting and satisfying performance of this concerto and the Chopin etude encore both get by far the most enthusiastic applause of the recorded occasion.

The concert finishes with a sparkling performance of a Dvorak Slavonic dance encore which Nelsons conducts well up to tempo and which receives appropriate enthusiastic applause.

The recording is of a high visual and sonic standard. The imaging is crisp and detailed and is based on obvious familiarity with the recorded works. The sound is equally fine and is presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1 and stereo.

I enjoyed this concert especially for Bronfmann's playing, for the fine orchestral response to all the pieces and the quality of the recorded sound. I will still be returning to several CD performances of the Scheherazade for more exciting renditions though. For my own taste, I can only wholeheartedly recommend this Scheherazade interpretation as an addition to more mainstream performances with offer more obvious drive and overt excitement.

I would therefore suggest that this undoubtedly finely played and recorded disc needs to be approached with some caution if your taste is for a red hot Scheherazade with plenty of Russian fire and dramatic drive.",1341619200,,3442,5.235934664246824
8519587,5,B007N0SW1O,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the audio quality of this disc. I wanted to get up and cheer after Scheherazade and the Dvorak; the Beethoven 5th, not so much.  I play this disc late at night (after the wife is asleep) so I can crank up the volume making my sizeable investment in playback equipment very worthwhile.

I believe this may be a 7.1 DTS-HD MA recording.  At least the 7.1 indicator logo lit up on both of my Blu ray players.",1339891200,,440,4.27710843373494
8519588,5,B007N0SW1O,"Recorded live one day after C Minor's disk of Andris Nelsons conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony (see my review) on 5 September 2011 at the Lucerne Festival, this production is another winner. Audio and video are flawless, the camera work is quite excellent, as we have come to expect from this label.

Andris Nelsons is a highly impressive young conductor, and the Concertgebouw musicians respond brilliantly and with enthusiasm to his (mostly smiling) directions. The generous program consists of the rarely heard Ruins of Athens overture, an intriguing late Beethoven piece, the ""Emperor"" piano concerto with Yefim Bronfman as a powerful and energetic soloist who also provides an encore, Chopin's Etude in F Major, Rimsky-Korsakov's tone poem Scheherazade and, finally, Dvorak's Slavonic Dance in A Major as an encore. Everything is superbly played. Bronfman's conception of the Fifth Piano Concerto is robust but not without subtlety: a joy to hear. Especially exciting is the interplay between piano and orchestra (note the period timpani played with hard sticks). If I were to nitpick, the only criticism I would offer is that Bronfman's reading of the concerto does not reveal anything ""new"" or so far unheard to me. For some listeners, this may be for the better, as he does not seem to be given to mannerisms, deep introspection or informed by any recent research of the score (for this listen to Buchbinder's new collection of the Beethoven concertos). The Chopin is wonderfully played: glittering and full of lan. Scheherazade is not too high on my list of favorites, but Nelsons and his Dutch orchestra play it with so much conviction, elegance and color that I find it irresistible and fresh, despite some rather slow passages. Solo work is stunning in the orchestra, everything shines, and this may be among the most inspired and inspiring interpretations of an old concert warhorse. Needless to say, the Dvorak encore is on the same level of perfection. Bravo, C Major and all participants!",1337040000,11,2043,5.172205438066465
8519589,5,B007N0SW1O,"We're almost half way through 2012, and this is my pick so far for ""Disc of the Year"". We have Andris Nelsons and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (RCO) at the top of their considerable form, an exquisite Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, a crackerjack Beethoven Emperor from Yefim Bronfman, and three good fillers, all recorded and directed in fabulous sound and video.

Scheherazade demands an orchestra of soloists, and the RCO is just the ticket. Listen to how the woodwind principals caress and cajole the themes out of their instruments in the second movement! Absolute magic! This is not to dismiss the efforts of the principal string and brass players, all of whom had me shaking my head and smiling.

This Scheherazade is taken a bit slower than average, but this allows Nelsons to coax the whole spectra of phrasing and sonority out of this great orchestra - surely one of the top three in the world. His enthusiasm is contagious, and the RCO obviously has tremendous rapport with him. I think he's all set to take over the mantle of ""magician"", previously ascribed to Stokowski. He's that good.

I last saw and heard Bronfman on video doing the Rachmaninov 3 with Rattle and the BPO at an outdoor concert - wonderful playing, iffy recording, replete with an infant crying lustily! He almost attacks the piano, and in this Emperor, he really romps through the first and third movements, but is tender and immensely poetic in the Adagio. This is a performance to leave you cheering, you get so caught up in it! It may be lacking some of the subtleties of the Buchbinder version, but this in an altogether more muscular and triumphant journey.

The concert is filled out by a Chopin etude, a Beethoven overture and a Dvorak Slavonic dance, all of which are very well done.

One thing I was pleased to note was the large percentage of women in this orchestra - Vienna Philharmonic please emulate this and enter the 21st. century!

All in all, a great disc, and one I shall return to any time I need cheering up!",1336953600,8,2017,4.732193732193732
