5338600,5,B009HSDC2Y,"I absolutely love these! There is a wide variety for whatever your needs are. Some days I do not have time for a 55 minute workout so I grab the 20 minute express. If I want an extra push, I grab the Zumba max. Want something different? Try the Global Burst. It has something for whatever my mood it. All of the discs play fine. I really like that I can turn the verbal cues on and off. I am just at the beginning of my weight loss journey so I LOVE that he has two different girls showing the beginners pace and the need to amp it up pace. Highly recommended!",1521936000,,560,4.008928571428571

5338609,5,B009HSDC2Y,"I am 62, over weight and out of shape. This dvd set has been great for me because I can actually do the dances. They are definitely designed for someone like me. I feel much better and more energized when I use the Zumba Fitness Gold dvd several days a week. Plus, if I don't have 45 minutes to do the entire dvd, I can just do a couple of the dances which still makes me feel good. When I first started, I couldn't do the entire dvd. I had to start with a couple of dances and work my way up to doing the entire workout. The strength training dvd is also very good. I recommend this dvd set to any who wants to get a workout but can't do the strenuous exercises or dances from other programs.",1514332800,13,693,3.9928057553956835

5338623,2,B009HSDC2Y,I'm glad to see that these videos have been helpful to some but they really are not for me. I'm a babyboomer and  attend 2 gold classes a week plus one regular zumba class (limiting myself to low impact). I agree that the video instructors are too talky and I would like to see more dancing and movement I enjoy Youtube zumba videos a lot more (but picture quality is not great). The shaker weights are kind of fun so maybe I'll use them if I ever go to toning classes.,1502236800,,469,4.153846153846154

5338732,4,B009HSDC2Y,"Pretty good. Not the best musically but I'm giving it 4 stars because it got me moving and inspired! The first time I felt like an ungraceful hippo but after a week I'm actually keeping up very well and it's fun. Moves that gave me trouble are a breeze. I'm sweating, feeling a wee bit sore (in that good way) and imagining doing the more challenging programs eventually.
I find the salsa, cumbia, merengue, etc, great. The ""swing"" is insipid and the tango worse. Beto is fun and Joy is encouraging but isn't the best dancer. She also likes to talk. This is fine in a live class but after repeated viewings you just want her to be quiet and not tell you how well you're doing. She also is very pedantic. Well meaning, but pedantic.
When the music is good, this works.
If you used to dance, are feeling older and needing to get up off that couch, this is a great way to start.

Update: I think this is a great introduction to Zumba. If you are not fit, the other DVDs might be intimidating. Whatever your age, if you just want to dip your toes into the pool, this is a great way to start.
The 1st DVD with steps is a waste. The workouts go so slow and are very easy and you can just jump in.
The 2nd DVD is mostly great, as described above.
The 3rd is Joy's show and for me, she drives me nuts. I don't want someone who has no idea how i'm doing telling me constantly I'm doing great. She also has no feel for the music so it's best to watch one of the other dancers. She seems nice but also she seems afraid of silence, which is a shame.

I'm working on other Zumba sets now and I wish I could describe the great feeling when you finally get it and you're actually dancing instead of huffing and puffing trying to follow. It doesn't take long and it's not that hard but what a great feeling! I haven't felt this good in years. Still waiting for the weight to start to shed but I am confident it's going to happen. And if it doesn't, I'm having fun.

5338735,5,B009HSDC2Y,"This is a complete set, to start zumba.  It is zumba gold, so it is a slower version of the high impact original version, but I recommend it because at this speed you are able to learn all the moves, do the entire workout without overdoing your heart and body, and build yourself up to the other version.  This comes with the sticks that you will use in both versions, and the instructions are very basic for all levels to learn, basic and beyond.  I also was able to start this being out of shape, and complete the whole session, so that was a bonus!  This is a great set and I still use it often.",1457308800,2,598,4.129310344827586
5338736,5,B009HSDC2Y,"I am 67. Five months ago my idea of being physically active was to--grudgingly--get up off the couch to find the remote. During these months I have tried various forms of at-home fitness DVDs including ""walking"" and cardio. Lately I have become bored with all of them and needed to try something new. I searched online for Zumba DVDs but all seemed to be too strenuous for my 67-year-old body. And then I found this one! I read the reviews and decided to try it. Happily, in my opinion, the positive reviews are about 98% accurate. The steps are really easy to follow and the resulting workout is definitely physical.

DVD 1, ""Step-by-Step"" thoroughly demonstrates how to do all of the moves and I had no trouble dancing along. DVD 2, ""Cardio"" starts off with a warm-up and then incorporates all of the steps taught in DVD 1. At first I had difficulty remembering the steps demonstrated on the first DVD, but the instructor did a really good job of showing how to do them again. DVD 3, ""Gold-Toning"" is when you get to use the 1-lb weights that are included.

Now my physical activities include ""walking at home,"" treadmill work, and Zumba! Yeah!",1457222400,14,1146,4.612745098039215

There is not enough cardio for a true fitness benefit nor enough in toning to protect bone-density.  So I tried Jazzercise Live dvd which is more my speed.

I was skeptical about purchasing this zumba fitness gold because I was concerned about it not being enough for me, but I eventually made the purchase.  I received it very fast and it comes in a very nice package.  I think my level of fitness is middle of the road when it comes to zumba.  The regular zumba is too fast and the zumba gold is too slow.  This is a very nice exercise video for the right level of fitness.  I love the creator of zumba.  I think he has to work hard to force himself to work at this senior pace.  He's a very enthusiastic instructor.",1440633600,2,845,4.0

5338881,4,B009HSDC2Y,"I inherited cruddy knees. I enjoyed taking Zumba classes, but was finding I really needed to take it down several notches in class. As a 40-something, that continues to be frustrating. I stopped taking classes for a while, trying to figure out how I could save my knees and enjoy Zumba. Enter Zumba Gold. I really enjoy it. First, some ""housekeeping"" for those of you interested in doing this: talk with your doctor and discuss any limitations you may have. Then, get yourself some sneakers that do not have a heavy tread on them (in other words, they shouldn't look like a tire). Twisting your knee is no fun. Next, give yourself about 6 feet from the TV  so you have the room to move.  There are three CDs: one gives you an overview of the moves, the second is about 30 minutes of cardio (though I didn't actually time it) and the final CD is toning. The box includes two 1-pound toning sticks. The steps are easy to follow. Beto's instructions are clear, if not occasionally off (for example, he has you put your hands on your hips then tells you to move your arms, then says ""Arms!"" which means put your hands on your hips again). Joy is the lead female and leads the cool-down as well as another segment. She is energetic. My biggest problem is with Josie, who is there to show you how to modify the steps. While she looks happy, I don't see how what she is doing is any different from what anyone else is doing. So ignore her. If you find that a move is complicated, who says you have to do it? Do another step. March in place. Do your favorite dance. Nobody is watching, so who cares? The point of Zumba is to exercise without it feeling like exercise!  While this is marketed to first-time Zumba participants and those over a certain age, I really think this is good for all ages/levels. Can't get to your regular class? Pop this in and do the cardio followed by the toning -- with your own weights. Afraid this is going to fast for you? Do what you can.  I just wish there was a Zumba Gold 2 because eventually I will be looking for more routines.  Recommended.",1427155200,11,2070,4.3662337662337665

5338904,1,B009HSDC2Y,"How can I describe my disappointment with these videos?  I don't feel that the developers of these videos really have any expertise in designing exercises for old adults, especially those with excess weight and/or knee issues.  I am 59 years old, overweight at 200 lbs, and I have bad knees (hard time going up/down steps).

The Cardio disc is comprised of nothing but 'fast' steps that don't engage your muscles well but they DO make you do a bunch of twisting and instanteous switching up in the moves.  Also, they don't stay in any one move long enough to get comfortable with it.  Way too much twisting, switching up, and even with that, the videos are actually boring.  I feel like Joy is just trying to show off without really being concerned about how a *real* older adult might actually pull off all of the fast movements (especially fast arm movements, like now your arms are down and suddenly they're above your head, just like that, without engaging muscles) and switching up.  Also, she takes way too much time at the beginning of the video talking to you like you're a 5 year old and have never exercised before.

The Gold Toning disc is a weird combination of both slow and boring non-Latin-dance movements and toe/foot movements and switch ups that don't really qualify as dance moves.  Very awkward exercise routine. Joy, the instructor, keeps mentioning balance, but the moves are just plain awkward, so it's no wonder you have to try to keep a balance--plus I thought this was supposed to be a workout(?).  It's like they want to do a video for older adults but just don't know how to pull it off.  The moves alternate between those suited for a 20 year old and those suited for a 90 year old.  I agree with another reviewer who said that the Zumba Exhilarate Step-By-Step is better, in that it's routines are much better, engaging, and give you a decent workout (however, the Step-By-Step is instructional so it doesn't feel like a workout, just instruction, so it's not ideal either).  Sorry for the negative review, but I was hoping for Latin dance moves that engage my whole body, especially gluteal, leg, and arm muscles, not just test how well you can twist and switch up your steps and 'balance'.",1425427200,18,2221,4.664102564102564

They even include a separate dvd to teach you the steps you will use in their routines. I watched the demonstration dvd once, then had no problem following the routines. I've done the 3rd DVD which includes light weights, but my favorite is the Zumba dance routine DVD, which I rotate with walking dvd's I like to do.  I consider myself an intermediate to advanced beginner in exercise and was worried that the Zumba Gold might be too strenuous. It's definitely a cardio workout for me, and at the end of the 40 minutes I feel like I have burned some calories. No bending or squats 'tho, nothing to kill the knees.

5338932,5,B009HSDC2Y,"I love this set! I am not a senior (46) and I walk 3 1/2 miles a day in the winter. I have osteoarthritis in my knees and rheumatoid arthritis. I'm 20 lbs away from my ideal weight based off the charts for my height. I can easily do Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs, albeit drenched in sweat. I found this to be a great workout. While I am not dripping in sweat, my muscles are telling me that this is working my core and everything else - even after doing the Step-by-Step DVD. On a side note, I have osteoarthritis in my left knee and rheumatoid arthritis in my hands.

I am not so great at choreography, even with Zumba Gold. I know it will get better though. I've tried the regular Zumba, but it was just a disaster. My thoughts are that when I master all of the moves and need something more, I may try the newer Zumba set. (Exhilarate? Although by the time I will be moving on, there will probably be a different Zumba workout available.)  I like that the Zumba Gold dance moves are slower and that this is low impact. It's not as beginner as say a Leslie Sansone 1-Mile or 2-Mile walks, but I do understand how some people feel this is ""not enough"". But I also can understand how this could be too much for others. Honestly, I cannot imagine either of my grandmas keeping up with this. (I don't mean any offense to anyone in the golden age range, I just mean MY grandmas.)

So... alternating these DVDs plus getting in my minimum 3-1/2 miles walking, plus following Marla Heller's DASH Diet for Weight Loss, I should be set. :)",1423440000,8,1523,4.244827586206896

5338935,5,B009HSDC2Y,Love this version.  I am 60 and while I used Zumba in the past I had stopped exercising over a year ago.  I was having trouble getting back into the very fast pace of the regular DVD.  This allows you to learn the steps at a slower pace (I even learned steps I thought I knew better) and I am gradually amping back up to the faster exercise.  Plus some of the execises are new and fun.  They also have a couple of dances working on balance and posture which can be very important as you get older.  Recommend it for anyone but particularly for those of us who are still active but older or just ramping back up into exercise.  Loads of fun.,1423440000,3,640,4.112903225806452

5338940,3,B009HSDC2Y,"To whom it may concern:
I read up on a lot of reviews before I ordered my set and must say, I was disappointed. I'm a young 72 yr. old and expected it to be more challenging. My Zumba class at the Y was much more effective. I was also amazed that it was in the form of various dance styles. Not much of a fan of that either. The video clip was also deceiving. It made it look more challenging (faster) then it really is.
I would like to get a DVD set with just Zumba dancing. Don't like having to buy all the health ""stuff"" that I know and now have already. Maybe you can design something for the serious Zumba fan with just the exercise routines.
I also agree with some of the reviewers about Beto and Joy not being easy to understand (music is interfering). That should be done better (and I have no hearing loss, yet!).  :-}

The Zumba instructor who teaches the Zumba class on campus for students does a better job then these 2 did in this video. I come to realize by reading other comments that this program was meant for older people and I am simply 25 year old guy here but I don't know it wasn't challenging enough for me. I come from a Spanish family so a lot of the moves he was teaching in the step by step I already knew but even in then the pace in the other videos was too slow and I felt like I didn't burn that much calories. I give it 3 stars because I am a Zumba fan and the class at my campus is well put together just not this specific program itself for Zumba Gold. Maybe it worked for other people but not for me.,1397779200,,950,3.953125

I liked that ""Beto"" was in the video explaining the ""do and don't"" moves. Comments from the Women at the RV Park Resort were:  1) they liked that it was low key. 2) they could dance and exercise at the same time. 2) they were able to follow it w/o feeling they over did it and unable to do it again. 3) some women felt it was too much for them, they felt it on their knees or low back. They stated they had a hard time following the person in back doing lowest key moves for people that could and/or should not do moves that Beto and Joy were doing, especially the toning video. Their eyes kept looking at Beto and Joy because they were in front.
The only thing I would recommend in changing is:  place the person doing the very low, low key movements in front with Beto and Joy to make it easier for people to follow them.",1393113600,5,865,4.052631578947368

These DVDs provide a good medium intensity cardio workout. My only suggestion is that a second cardio DVD could be included in the DVD set.

If you have never taken Zumba this is great, if you are older and tad slower this is the right package for you. The 40 minute cardio DVD is a good workout.

5339190,4,B009HSDC2Y,"I am 33 years old and 275lbs.  Although I am outside the target audience for Zumba Gold, the reduced speed and intensity of this workout is allowing me to get some much needed exercise while having a lot more fun than getting on a treadmill.  I have zero dance experience and up until this workout, the only cardio videos that I have successfully completed are a variety of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away The Pounds (WATP).

Compared to any of the WATP workouts, Zumba Gold has infinitely better music.  Zumba Gold is more challenging to follow than WATP because the instructor gives much less instruction during the workout than Leslie and the moves are less repetitious.

The Zumba Gold Step by Step DVD does not cover all of the movements performed in the Cardio workout, such as the swing step and the hip hop moves.  The Tango section seems misplaced - it is located in the middle of the workout but it is so slow that my heart rate drops.  It would be better near the warmup or cooldown.  I wish that the cardio DVD had a menu option to skip Joy's introduction, which contains health warnings that I don't want to watch every time I workout.

I'm still having trouble adding ""flavor"" and getting my hips to move anything like the Zumba Gold dancers on the DVD, but I think this will come with time and I'm already feeling less robotic.  I haven't lost any weight because I haven't adjusted my eating habits, but I'm noticing a big difference in my range of motion and energy level during everyday activities.

I'm not a hardcore exerciser, but this DVD was bland at best.  I was barely breathing harder and definitely did not break a sweat.  On the positive side, the instructional DVD was really good at breaking down the steps even for someone like me with two left feet.  I would only recommend this to someone who isn't really use to exercising and needs really low impact.  If you've taken a Zumba class or exercise even semi-regularly, you'll probably be bored and finish feeling like you still need a workout.

5339260,5,B009HSDC2Y,"I loved the original Zumba dance program but always had to modify moves and speed to accommodate pesky health issues. As I had been a dance exercise instructor for many years, I knew how to work with the moves but noticed many in class struggled. All too often they dropped out of class because of frustration or injury. The instructor was very professional in attempting to find alternative steps for those clients but the program itself is not about instruction but the element of ""fun"".

The Zumba Gold can provide the same fun moves and music at a slower pace with more repetitions .One of the background dancers demonstrates modifications that will be helpful to those just beginning dance exercise or those who need to monitor heart rate and breathing more closely. Even simple marching in place to the music would be a great start.

For those who love using music for walking  exercise this is a great program. For those just getting off the couch it is inspiring. For those struggling with joint issues or exercise induced asthma,this might be just what you're looking for.

If you are used to  high impact,hard pounding,punishing work outs,you'll most likely be disappointed. While the moves can be exaggerated,or light hand weights held for more effort,this work out is just as advertised...a program for healthy seniors or those beginning a fitness program.",1369440000,51,1368,4.956331877729258

5339264,3,B009HSDC2Y,Wanted to loose a few pounds and had seen examples of Zumba dance routines etc and thought they might be a little energetic for me--so I saw this product and I thought it would be a nice in between. Personally I found it a little slow for me--I really thought there would be more than one dance routine and it might go a bit faster then it did--or have another routine or music piece at a faster speed.  I tend to get bored doing one routine over and over so a variety would be nice. Different levels might have been even nicer!  Some days I have lots of energy and others I need to do something but don't have a lot.  I have used the instruction portion and they do take you through each step and it is easy to learn them. They break it down nicely. The dancing as I said is on the slower side but if you put something in to it you probably could work up a minor sweat. I have not used the toning portion so I cannot comment on that. It was okay and I will probably use it off and on but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.,1369094400,,1028,3.9805825242718447

I had read some reviews that the workout was not intense enough. I felt it was a good intense cardio workout that is targeted for 50 and over.  I plan to use this workout until I can handle a faster Zumba and then I'll switch to the Exhilerate workout which I also have. I didn't give 5 stars because I felt Beto should have had better cueing If you're used to very good cueing when doing a workout, you won't see it here. You basically have to just watch and follow when the workout starts. The dance teaching CD is good..but when you start working out on the cardio, it's fast and I got a little behind trying to keep up with them. I'll probably get it after a few more sessions. All in all a great workout for those who are new to Zumba and those who can't keep up with regular Zumba (like me).",1368921600,30,963,4.068421052631579

I hated losing the main Gina workout, but I couldn't justify keeping the whole set at $90... so I sent it back. NOW I have Zumba Gold. Beto is in this workout, and it's a good workout. It comes with a dvd to learn the steps, one workout dvd and one toning dvd for $50. I think that Zumba Gold is a bit overpriced for what you get. It would be more worthwhile if there were two different workouts, just to mix it up. Frankly, at 51 years old, I could stand a series with an intensity that is in between regular Zumba and Zumba Gold. Zumba Gold would be great for my mom, who is 71. I'll keep this set. I mix it up with Joel Harper Firming after 50 and Jane Fonda's different dvd's from the past few years. FYI, I live 15 miles from the closest place to actually take Zumba classes, so it's best for me to work out at home. I hear Zumba live classes are the best.",1367539200,,1026,4.109452736318408

I appreciate the instruction disc. The pace of the second disc suits my needs at my level.
Personally, I wasn't the least bit irritated by the presenters or their banter. Some reviewers must be a lot more irritable than me.
If Joy Prouty is stiff and ungraceful, she's no moreso than I! She inspires hope that life needn't be weak and sedentary in the 70s. I'd like to see how well some of those critics of 'that old, blonde gal'  dance when they're 70.
The third disc adds some fun strength and toning activity, to round out the program .

A friend mentioned Zumba but when I watched a video on Youtube I knew I wasn't in shape enough for it. Then I heard about Zumba Gold. I bought this hoping for the best but not really expecting much. Boy was I surprised. I like the moves, the music is catchy and it's really easy to learn the steps. I sweat, have fun and amazingly I have noticed I have more energy and my clothes are looser. This was money well spent. My goal is to move from Gold to the regular Zumba.

HINT: Buy a good pair of dance exercise shoes because you need to be able to pivot quickly. Running shoes and cross trainers grip the floor and make moving quickly awkward. I bought a pair of Ryka's and I'm very happy with them.",1365724800,13,841,4.005952380952381

5339316,3,B009HSDC2Y,"This set comes with 3 DVDs.
The how to DVD comes with step by  step instructions on how to do each of the dance steps. This portion of the DVD is done beautifuly. It truely helped me as I am and always have been clumbsy. It also includes some boring propaganda ""health"" inteviews. They are perfect for falling asleep to, or maybe skipping over. I imagine they are the sponsers of the DVD sets. The other DVDs have music in the back ground with instructors and a class. It is fairly well filmed and easy to follow. The nice thing is there are no flashing lights, like some of the other DVDs have. (For the migraine and seizure sufferers, this is a must.)
An unfortunate choice is, they spend moments showing the instructors smiling at us and one tells us ""it's easy"". Apparently they don't know the audience. I for one, am a clumbsy, deconditioned, suffering participant. It isn't easy. I want to be able to turn off his voice and just hear the music. That is not an option.
The Zumba Cardio DVD is zumba music with easy paced dance moves. Half way through that DVD they have the class work on balance by walking through a tango. That is poorly placed. It Would have been more properly placed at the beginning as it is barely a warm up and best for the older people who may not make it through the first 20 minutes to this dance.  The Tone up DVD is worked with ""exercise sticks"" with a maracca sound to them. It is worth buying the whole set just for these fun sticks. They are light weights. The class is an easy to follow, nice paced class with dance moves with the weights.
I work full time, am 51, have fibromyalgia, herniated discs, arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and oh you don't want to know all my woes. Exercise is hard and it hurts, it makes me itch, and I hate it.

I had a hard time getting past the instructor Beto having a right hand helper that seemed like she was in her 70s.  It goes through the basic steps and then a practice cd after that.

However I would recomend it to anyone, just be careful cause its NOT super easy on the knees, as you are up dancing all the time, you can do it at your own pace anytime you need to. Stay with the step by step DVD( #1) for more than 5 days, the Cardio is a super work out, I have been doing it since jan 27 or 29th of this year (2013) & I'm still getting a work out I've bumped my workout to 2 times a day. The toning is also another one where they change directions & not tell you which way to go  Over all I would give this DVD set a 5 STARS.

This is fun and easy to do, but don't let that statement fool you, you will walk away sweaty and in dire need of a shower. This is an exercise program that works well for those of us who have arthritis issues in our knees. It is a little lower impact than other Zumba programs. It includes one whole routine to get you going and help you learn all the different dances that you will use through out, and it doesn't just demonstrate it once and then take off at breakneck speed. It eases you into it and you can spend the first week only using that routine while you become comfortable with the steps AND STILL get a decent workout.

5339381,3,B009HSDC2Y,"I picked this up precisely because it was geared toward my generation (which I'm admittedly at the tail end of). I was looking for something to break my largely sedentary lifestyle and get me moving again without too much stress. I suffer from gout, so the sort of low-impact work offered here was ideal.

I've been through all three discs one time, and I have to say the Gold Toning disc was the most frustrating: they have a disc dedicated to the steps you're going to see in the workouts, but the Cardio workout barely used any of what was taught, and the Gold Toning workout used a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't taught. I was very frustrated to find that I came to the Gold Toning workout feeling like I was prepared (after all, the steps for Cardio were in the Step by Step video) and frequently found myself completely lost and feeling uncoordinated.

Now, I expect that to happen at the beginning of a workout program, because I'm not the most graceful guy to begin with: even when I get moves down from workout videos, I rarely execute them with any style.

But this system included a ""how to"" disc that is virtually useless where the workouts are concerned: you don't really need to watch the disc to pick up the stuff in Cardio, and watching the disc doesn't help in Gold Toning when it uses a bunch of steps that weren't covered.

I've worked up a decent sweat doing each disc, and I'm sure I'll get better going forward (without style), but I was really disappointed at the lack of instruction in a program that was packaged with an instructional disc.",1361491200,,1567,4.487719298245614

5339386,4,B009HSDC2Y,"My 91-year old mother and I [age 67) love this as a program we can actually do. Each of the three DVDs is fun, and Beto makes me laugh as he corrects the non-Latin dance technique of the 70-ish co-instructor, Joy, on disc #1 -- the instruction disc. Both female instructors on disc #3, the toning program using ""maraca"" sticks, are good in their own right.

There are ""young"" female and male exercisers in the background on discs #2 (the 45-minute exercise routine) and disc #3, but they are unobtrusive and make the screen visually more interesting. Mom asks for the DVD to be played even when the sun is shining and she wants an excuse to move vigorously indoors. I liked the DVDs so much that I told Mom's friends about them, and ordered an extra set to donate to the local public library.

To justify the high price, I considered the set to be the equivalent of two months of senior exercise classes -- with the added benefit of two toning sticks (that can be used either by me or by my grandchildren).",1361404800,33,1006,4.4324324324324325

I just stayed a couch potato.  I needed to make a change so I picked this as the one to start with.  My balance, coordination, and general fitness need a lot of help.  I could stand to lose a few pounds but the other items are higher priority.  In the time I have been doing this workout I have noticed an improvement in my balance and coordination.  I so look forward to doing the Cardio Party.  Beto is a fun and charming instructor.  Joy has been in the fitness business for a long time and is easy to respect.  Together I enjoyed them as co-instructors so I hope they do more of these, especially with Beto being present as an instructor.  I love the music so much so that I would buy a CD of the songs from the Cardio Party workout just to listen to.  As a result of my fondness for this workout, I bought the other Zumba that was released called Exhilarate and I did watch one of the DVD's.  I like this one better.  On the DVD I did watch, Beto wasn't present at all.  The music wasn't as pleasing to my ears.  The production values don't seem quite as high and, holy smokes I am not in good enough shape to even attempt.  Maybe I will change my mind in time regarding the other one.
