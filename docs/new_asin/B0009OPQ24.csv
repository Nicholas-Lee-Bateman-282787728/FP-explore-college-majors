The DVD was also to cover Bending your own flats and screw builds and other subjects that were not at all in this versions even though the DVD cover say it is... I was dissapointed to spend 65 bucks and not reciever the information I wanted.... I would not mind to pay that amount of money if it was as it was advertised but sadly it was not.....",1303689600,3,473,4.096774193548387
8064326,3,B0009OPQ24,"...Like good detail with the video.

But you might find that you get what you need.
Like step by step how to assemble from a parts kit.
922(r) issues.
And a pretty good rundown of bending a flat.

If you can't find a better video, this one will do just fine.",1243296000,2,258,4.03921568627451
8064327,1,B0009OPQ24,What a disappointment. Has a very skilled machinist but the tape doesn't really explain much at all. Worst $ 60.00 I've spent in a long time.,1139875200,,141,4.461538461538462
