8480311,5,B005NCK96A,"REMOVE OBSTACLES: 5 Pastor-Driven Obstacles to Growth is a touchy, yet necessary teaching in Dick Hardy's series.  Sometimes when a church is failing or not growing as quickly as it should/could, the blame falls on the pastor, not his congregation and staff.  This set will allow each pastor to take an introspective look and critique themselves to see if they are making one or all of these mistakes.  Dick makes 2 points that really stand out to me in this teaching set: 1) a church can only grow as far as the lead pastor and 2) recognizing the problem of ""short-term fatherhood"" in the church.  These are 2 very real and very fixable problems in the church today and acquiring 5 Pastor-Driven Obstacles to Growth is the first step in the direction of repairing the breech.",1322524800,,776,4.6838235294117645

In this 10-minute teaching, Dick Hardy opens our eyes to potentially five pastor-driven obstacles to growth.  As church leaders, if we are desiring to see a new culture within our congregations and growth within our churches, we have to tackle the question: ""Are we growing?""
