Jeff teaches you very quickly and easily how to wade through all of the gibberish and so-called ""nutrition facts"" on packaged food labels in order to make better choices.  The presentation is lively and sometimes funny, but makes a number of very important points teaching you how to evaluate the ingredients and percentages of fat, sugar and salt to determine is the product is something that you want to put in your shopping cart and bring home.  I highly recommend this video.  This was filmed in front of a live audience at a multi-day workshop.",1297900800,11,636,5.0285714285714285
