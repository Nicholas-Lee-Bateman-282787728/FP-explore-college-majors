7813913,5,6301697103,"The Malibu Bikini Shop was typical 1980's B-Movie goodness
It was made for males 12-50 and was a bit simple but, still enjoyable
The director I'm sure was doing huge amounts of coke! It was the 80's
Two brothers inherit a bikini shop from there Aunt
You see the aunt at the start of the film but, it's never really explained how she even died
the two brothers are complete opposite
Now that i think about it a lot of backstory of the brothers was later used in the NBC sitcom Wings
(It might sound crazy but, there are plenty of similarities!)
The brothers take over the shop with gorgeous looking female employees
install a one way mirror  you have plenty of 80's style t&a

I haven't seen it since '92 or so but, i always enjoyed it
It was the perfect 1980's alpha male flick plenty of hot woman and sleazy 1980's nudity

I'd love to have this on a digital format hell I'd take a Laderdisc copy of it but, paying two bills for a VHS Cassette tape is a bit high
Nothing against VHS but, I have plenty buried in a storage unit
It's a real guilty pleasure that I'm sure anyone growing up in the 80's and early 90's seen a few times  8.5/10",1449014400,3,1138,4.206422018348624

7813918,5,6301697103,"This is the kind of movie you need when you're hanging around with the guys and already had some drinks. I swear it's getting really funny when we start watching this flick. Pure 80s in fashion, haircuts, music and everything else. Actually the acting and the humor of this movie are so bad, that it is already good again. It shouldn't be too difficult to find it. Try it at your next party; you won't regret it!",1045872000,7,412,4.363636363636363
