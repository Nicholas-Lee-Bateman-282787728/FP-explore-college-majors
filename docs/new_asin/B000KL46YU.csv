8157939,4,B000KL46YU,"Without sounding off the spoiler alert, this movie  has a unique and interesting storyline for a vampire movie. It delivers on the biting with just enough blood and gore for a vampire film.  The only downside to this movie is that they have ""special effected"" the bite scenes. Meaning they look really cool and they are finished in a second or two. Don't expect Emmy award like acting, or a large budget film, but it's worth a look for the vampire /horror movie enthusiast.",1417219200,,473,4.619047619047619

8157944,3,B000KL46YU,"This film, shot on video is not all that bad, until near the end.

In this film vampires are divided into various clans with a queen  the head of each one. Lourdes Colon plays (Santa Maria) one such queen (oddly though she's only credited as Lourdes). She's head of the 'snake' clan.

She's condemned by another queen to a type of living hell by being buried 'alive' (? she's undead)

Go to the present where Lendon LeMelle (as Jeremy Williams) lives a bit of a loner/loser life. He's at High School and avoids being beaten up by jocks.

He uncovers Santa Maria and nurses her back to 'life'. It got cool as she gets naked and makes love to the loser (hence the 2 of the 3 stars)... but soon goes weird.

All the jocks and their chicks are invited to Santa Maria's house for a party where she proceeds to kill them all. Each time she attacks the prostetics around her mouth get sillier and siller till her mouth is almost a snout. Remarkably, each time having ripped out someone's throat and being covered with blood she returns to the party pristine clean.

She bites one guy and then tells him that her poison has now entered his body and he's paralysed (foaming at the mouth), then she rips his throat out. Why? She's already over-powered plenty of others and ripped their thorats out. Why'd she have to inject poison into this one first?

What happened to her rival vampire queen from the begninning of the film?",1247356800,5,1416,4.461240310077519
8157945,3,B000KL46YU,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would be of professional quality.  I was quite disappointed with the quality of the DVDR I received.  With the obvious extensive research that was put into finding these locations and the time taken to drive to them (all over NYC), I was surprised that they wouldn't have put together a better product.  Rather than to try several takes and then edit the best takes together later, it appears the guys that made this video did it in a one take style.  The footage reminds me of a shaky, noisy home movie, or teenagers turned loose with a video camera.  Three guys take turns telling about different KISS related locations.  The collection of KISS memorabillia they show is what appears to be in one of the guys bedroom as he pulls his vintage KISS treasues out of boxes.  Some ok stuff, but nothing spectacular.  The delivery could have been much better all around.  The only high points I found- It was interesting to see the locations that I have heard and read about for many years & probably will never see in person.  Also, the directions to each site is a nice bonus.  If these guys spent some time & did it right, this could be a killer DVD.",1174608000,,1181,4.47196261682243
