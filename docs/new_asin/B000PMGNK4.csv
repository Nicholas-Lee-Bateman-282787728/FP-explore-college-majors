2827313,5,B000PMGNK4,"Solid State Society is hopefully a sign of what is to come in the world of Ghost in the Shell. After Stand Alone Complex's 2nd GIG, I was definitely left with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The pacing of the 2nd GIG felt uneven and the story felt more convoluted than tastefully complex, creating an adequate but not perfect addition to the GitS series. However, Solid State Society takes the best from the Stand Alone Complex series and in little under two hours presents a story as rich in detail and as lovingly complex as the series preceding it.

A huge plus of the movie is that instead of feeling like an overstretched episode, it feels more like a long arc of quality episodes stringed together while still feeling cinematic in its presentation. Solid State Society gives us everything we expect in a GitS story: a sci-fi universe that draws you in but never overwhelms, continuity in character development, rich and intelligent dialogue and plot that almost seems plausible down the road, and of course, some light philosophy and shades of grey. Even if you aren't an anime or a strict sci-fi fan, you might just enjoy this one.",1180224000,60,1136,4.737373737373737

I do wonder if only a handful of us got a effective DVD or if some people simply chose not to mention the annoyance of a movie that seems to skip/stutter every so often.",1500768000,,469,4.517647058823529

2827353,5,B000PMGNK4,"My only complaint is that there isn't more.

Thoughtful and considered anime is a rare thing, with the majority being so focused on the animation and less so on the story, or high on concept while being low on practice. Ghost in the Shell: SAC Solid State Society is the end of the Stand Alone Complex series, and while it's a good ending, it only serves to highlight how well made the series was, and how it could have continued for beyond the ~50 episodes produced.

While Arise is good, and serves as a well produced reboot, or prequel, to this long running series, Stand Alone Complex continues to be my favorite iteration.

My only true gripe is that the subtitles still have minor yet glaring mistakes that simply should not exist. For instance, near the end Batou refers to a Tachikoma and the sub reads ""touch coma"". Really? One of the most recognizable characters/words from the series and they mistake it for gibberish? An extremely minor gripe, to be fair.

Overall this is a fitting ending to the acclaimed series, but I'm selfish, and will always want more.",1445040000,2,1070,4.645502645502646

2827358,3,B000PMGNK4,"I watched Solid State Society in between Stand Alone Complex and the original GITS. I want to rate SSS up because it is GITS but I have to say it is definitely a cut below the rest of the franchise, mainly in terms of plotline. The one exception is the chilling twist at the end of SSS. If you are a fan of GITS then of course this is a must watch but keep your expectations moderate. While I find SSS to be so-so as far as GITS goes, it is still better than most of what is out there. 3.5 stars.",1443657600,,496,3.872549019607843

2827362,5,B000PMGNK4,"Stand alone (ha!) OVA that takes place after the events of Ghost in The Shell 2nd Gig (Season 2), this movie is the final chapter of the Ghost in The Shell original television series timeline.  It is like an extended episode, and has callbacks to the first and second season.  It is visually impressive on Blu-Ray and proceeds along at a rapid pace that definitely holds the viewer's attention.  If you watch the series without having seen both seasons of the original TV series, you'll miss a lot of the significance of what you are watching, especially the Tachikomas.  Seeing them again brought a tear to my eye, as they're the unsung heroes of the entire series run.  If you've seen the dramatic climax of Season 2, you will appreciate what I'm talking about.  The original television series tells a slightly different version of the story than the original movie, and the new OVAs, GITS: Arise are ostensibly PREQUELS to the original series, at least insofar as they occur chronologically prior, with all of the characters being younger versions of themselves, telling the story of how Section 9 came to be.  Solid State Society occurs furthest in the future of all the timelines and is a worthy finale to the original television show.",1436486400,5,1240,4.793427230046948

One reason is that i found both tv series hugely disappointing from a story POV[although from a technical & anime POV, it was amazing]vs shirow's mangas.reason is shirow backs up future technology & gun/bullet theory into the manga & the tv series writers just recycled 70s western movies & stupid sci=fi speculation...

Now i really enjoyed this anime movie bec it seems to be based on shirow GITS 1.5 human error series and the first comic book of shirow GITS. that's makes this movie interesting bec it closely matches the actual source DNA.

only odd thing is that positive GITS fans reviewers don't seem to have read shirow's mangas to point out what i stated above. so much for fandom geeks...?",1430179200,,890,4.848684210526316

2827398,5,B000PMGNK4,"Without dissecting the plot, Motoko has left Section 9, and her interaction here reminded me of Innocence; you idealize over her short appearances, and end up reeled closer to her than ever by the end. There's also less action, with more character bonding and a more mysterious plot to engage the brain.

There was a pretty big time lapse between me watching the series and this ""sequal"", but Solid State Society starts as fast, if not faster paced and awesome than where it left off. The intro, even the title menu will get you pumped and grinning like a school boy/girl.

Huge contributor to that was the OST; a lot has been recycled from the series, but this is by no means a bad thing. I believe GitS' OSTs to be the most provoking, adaptive and beautiful i've heard (NGE is up there too).

As I clicked play, I was metaphorically slapped in the face; I was passively watching the show while doing a few other house activities. You can't simply let GitS roll in the background and expect to comprehend it without dedicating your full attention.

And as always, the english cast is phenominal.

Bottom Line:
-Phenominal dub
-Beautiful OST
-Story line twists that will leave your head spinning even after the credits start rolling
-That faint romantic tension (it's not just me right?) between Motoko and (maybe Batou, or maybe some urge she just hasn't fulfilled yet in life. I haven't pinpointed it.)
-Must buy for a fan of any degree",1373500800,,1438,4.66798418972332
2827399,5,B000PMGNK4,"This takes place in Japan 2034, a few years after S.A.C. ends and Motoko leaves Section 9. Togusa is now the leader of Section 9, and I'm happy about that because he has always been one of my favorite characters. You can really feel his struggle to balance work and family with his new position. Not going to spoil anything but there is a scene where I was actually tensed up and holding my breath, and it deals with Togusa and Batou. As usual all the voice actors do a great job and the animation is solid. Not sure if the frame rate is choppy or it was just my xbox 360 but there was flickering every now and then.

The story itself is good but takes a good chunk of the movie to get rolling. I'm not saying it needs action all the time, because we're talking about Ghost in the Shell here and if you know anything about the series is that it is VERY dialogue heavy and requires your attention to understand what's going on. It was good seeing the Tachikomas again, although it felt forced like they just threw them in there for the sake of it.

2827412,5,B000PMGNK4,"There already are plenty of reviews for the DVD of this title, but I shall just mention a few reactions to the film, then talk about the blu ray release.

Solid State Society is a Ghost in the Shell motion picture.  Do not be fooled by the ""Stand Alone Complex"" subheading and think it is a few TV episodes or something.  This means top quality animation, a great music soundtrack, a complete story from start to finish and not much in the way of needing to see previous content to enjoy.  I should know, I've only seen the SAC first series and not 2nd GIG yet.  It also has a bit darker feel than the TV series, as to be expected from the films.  What is so impressive about the animation is (keep in mind I'm comparing this to previous GITS movies) the use of camera shaking, lens flares, and best of all tasteful use of 3D/CGI-type treatments.  Personally I think GITS 2.0 completely ruined the original first film, as the added 3D elements painfully stood out in comparison to the 2D shots, but that's another story.

As for the blu ray, you get some extras but as I always watch with Japanese audio & English subs, I don't bother watching the English 'behind-the-scenes' extras.  I will say, however, that the Japanese TRAILER that is included is incredible.  So much better than the Bandai English trailer... I only wish there was a subtitle option for the Japanese trailer, but oh well.  There are no inserts of any kind, just the disc in the case.  The picture quality is brilliant; super-sharp, beautiful colors and of course looks great when colors are muted with the lovely washed-out tone that GITS commonly has.  Sorry I can't say much about the audio quality as I just use headphones and play it on a computer, but it sure sounded great to me.  Currently this movie is at a very affordable price, especially for anime on blu-ray so don't hesitate - Ghost in the Shell SAC - Solid State Society is worth it!",1326067200,16,1920,4.495677233429395

SAC 2's ending was ""bittersweet"" as one reviewer put it, but it had the finality of closing a superb novel.  Solid State reopened the book.
To the writers' credit Solid State makes good social/philosophical points as GITS always has.  However, old lines & moves seem tossed out like cliches.  Also, I'm not a big fan of resurrecting characters with a quick explanation to include them in a movie or series.  I'm a GITS junky and enjoyed this latest injection, and I'm enjoying the soundtrack right now.  However, it was just good and not stupendous like the others.  There's plenty of room to create a 3rd series (and I hope they do), which may help out Solid State's place.

2827417,5,B000PMGNK4,"Kkaku kidtai: Stand Alone Complex- Solid State Society. It has been two years since the end of 2nd Gig, when ""Major"" Motoko Kusanagi left Section 9, a Special Forces unit assigned to cyber crime and answerable only to the Prime Minister of Japan in 2034. Family man Togusa is now leading a much larger force. Chief Aramaki has visibly aged in the job, walking painfully with a cane and attended by Proto. Batou has become a brooding, depressed commander of the training school. All wonder if the Major will ever return. This time around our heroes must deal with the seemingly unconnected rash of suicides, mass child abductions, conspiracy involving elderly healthcare, a ""Wizard Class"" hacker called the Puppeteer, and as always, corporate malfeasance and political wrangling. All tidied up with a terrific subtle ""what if?"" ending. At $3.2 million SSS is one of the most expensive TV movie anime's yet, and all the money is up on the screen. Illuminating the convoluted storyline are: Increased detail in both background and foreground (missing in 2nd Gig). ""Busy"" scenes found only in big budget movies. Naturally smooth movement by people and machines. Small touches like the Nissan concept cars, wrinkled clothing, reflections and small lighting effects, raindrops, ""Handheld"" camera angles, etc. There are plenty of ""remember this?"" scenes and other touchstones from the series, including great music by Yoko Kanno, with Origa singing the opening and closing songs. Motoko's face is even cuter than ever and the rest of her- you just don't mess with perfection. GITS: SAC is not for anime fans looking for scantily dressed little girls, giant robots or magical swordplay. Its story lines, dialogue and multiple overlapping themes are more suited to readers of William Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" or P. K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""

2827421,3,B000PMGNK4,"As the Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex TV series achieved a level of popularity not seen in the franchise since the original GITS anime, a movie followup to the series was a no-brainer. Like some films that act as conclusions to an anime TV series like Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost Sweeper Mikami, and Nadesico, this brings the entire original cast back together for one last ride.

About two years after the second season of the series(2nd Gig), Matoko has left Section 9 to go work on her own. Since then, Togusa has stopped bleaching his hair and become field commander, while Batou is off being picky about which cases he takes. A foreign colonel kills himself on Togusa's watch for fear of a master hacker called the Puppeteer. The colonel's father is an exiled aging dictator under Japanese asylum, who is soon found to be dead by a micromachine virus. Batou goes to arrest someone connected to the virus, but runs into Matoko. He keeps this a secret from the other Section 9 members because he thinks she might actually be the Puppeteer. The investivagation leads into something called the Solid State Society, which is a secret government orginization running under a project titled Noble Rot. where abandonned or orphened children are left to take care of eldery citizens with no one left to leave their inheritence to. The Solid State was actually brainwashing these children and grooming them to be a docile next generation, with the wealth and power coming from their foster parents. They're also responsible for kidnapping thousands of children from abused families. The true Puppeteer turns out to be an individual A.I. that emerged from the collected consciousness of all the puppet personas that Matoka herself used through prosthetic bodies she controlled over the last few years. The children are then sent back to their families, and Matoko rejoins Section 9.

Solid State Society was a fine continuation of Stand Alone Complex, it however was a little lacking in the kind of production seen in a theatrical release. The quality was too similar to the that of the TV show, and when you're taking an animated series and turning it into a movie, it has to be a better than the original format. Considering how realistic some of the shots in GITS: Innocence and the recent GITS 2.0 reproduction, SSS should've been more polished than it was. The story fits well together, but anyone who hasn't seen the original SAC series will be pretty lost on some of the nuiances of the plot(like what the hell happened to the Tachikomas!). Unless there's going to be anything more from the GITS anime world in the next few years, this was a fitting finale to Shirow's cyberpunk saga.",1265673600,2,2693,4.839479392624729

2827433,5,B000PMGNK4,"This GITS movie accomplished everything I hoped it would. The continuity between the television series and the movie is all there, complete with a beefed up budget for improved animation and action.

I have always wondered how prophetic the GITS universe is given our changing times, and this movie evokes those same kinds of questions. In an increasingly wireless society, what are the perils of human beings becoming consciousness-floating entities of the Net? With greater freedom and power comes the freedom to die or become maimed in unimaginable ways by new evils.

Seeing this film for the first time there's no way you will understand or catch everything; that's a strength, though, not a weakness. This isn't a simple throw-away-after-one-view movie. It has a philosophical angle lurking in the background, making you think. By ""lurking in the background"", I mean that this aspect isn't in your face or preachy (as some anime has a tendency to be).

Ghost in the Shell is unique in the anime universe as far as I know. Too much anime suffers from a lack of seamless pacing, realistic animation, or well-developed characters in a richly complex world. I have enjoyed other anime series to be sure (Gasaraki, Samurai Champloo, RahXephon, X, etc.), however none of these has the same philosophical possibilities or intriguing futuristic vision. Whereas some anime can seem like entertainment escapism, GITS occasionally causes me to hit upon formerly undiscovered nuances about human nature or the nature of technology itself - the challenges technology presents to a society and the opportunities it creates for alienation, exploitation, and human consciousness. I highly recommend anything in the Ghost in the Shell universe. It will hack into your psyche...and I mean that in a good way.",1201392000,,1796,5.186206896551724

  Just what makes GITS so appealing anyway?  Is it good as a military series? Is it he Action? The characters? The themes and philosophical points behind it?
If that's what you're looking for, you should check out Full Metal Panic, especially The Second Raid; It will SMOKE Ghost in the Shell in all the aspects mentioned above, but most notably in the ""characters"" department -the characters from Full Metal Panic actually have charisma.
  People keep talking about the depth and philosophical meaning behind Ghost in the Shell, but what does Solid State Society have to offer in these aspects?  Mainly, it brings up the role that the elderly play in society, as well as the problem of child abuse...Okay.

2827440,4,B000PMGNK4,"Ghost in The Shell - Solid State Society, is the latest production based on the ""Ghost in the Shell"" franchise, created by Masamune Shirow originally published as a manga by Kodansha (in Japan) and Dark Horse Comics in the U.S. It is available in two editions, the standard one and the ""Limited Edition"", targeted at collectiors and fans of the series.

For those of you that are not familiar with the franchise, it is set on a not-so-far future where mankind has embraced technologies to enhance the human beings in body and mind. Taking some characteristics from the ""cyberpunk"" genre of sci-fi, the series deal with the social repercursions of an ""information era"", the status-quo of prosthetics and other physical enhancements and, in esence, with the concepts and philosophies of existence, self-awareness, and the true meaning of the ""human being"" concept in a context where the so called cyborgs, normally cybernitically enhanced human brains in artificial bodies exist too. These are one of the many reasons of why the Ghost in the Shell series are considered one of the most influential works for the sci-fi genre and the anime/manga context.

However, each incarnation of the Ghost in the Shell franchise, has it's own story arch and approach. For example, the manga works are interesting but messy. The characters sometimes are deep, or sometimes are really light-hearted. Understanding them requires having some background of the cyberpunk theme (William Gibson, Bruce Sterling), some knowledge of the manga-as-a-comic-book concept (so you don't get lost within the strips), reading the many footnotes the author includes on them, and backreading. Solid State Society for instance, continues the plot and concepts showed in the anime series (more about it in a moment).

The anime feature movies (Ghost in the shell, Ghost in the shell II: Innocence) are based on the manga, however, they treat the themes on the manga in a totally cinematic and deep way, developing the characters far beyond the manga in some aspects and presenting the viewer with a full overview of the concept and main philosophy.

For instance, the anime series, Ghost in The Shell Stand Alone Complex, take some aspects from the manga, but it's main focus is to deal with how the characters interact with their world, and the existential and social problems this future has for humanity. In this case, Solid State Society, continues the concept and plot established by this series, having little to do with the movies or manga. Consider it as an ""long-play special episode"" that fits after the end of the second season of Stand Alone Complex.

So, for those new to the series, I recommend you to get a glimpse of the other options to enter the world of Ghost in The Shell and its many differences, before buying it. Or get the Stand Alone Complex Season 1 and Season 2 for the matter. Otherwise, come on in!

Solid State Society, is a solid, complex, movie that doesn't waste its 120 minutes of running length. The plot is well constructed and the twists that compose it, far beyond of making it boring or difficult to understand, guide the viewer easily from start to finish. It flwalessly continues the events in Stand Alone Complex season 2, and also opens a new saga in the series. Character visual design and overall graphic presentation are quite polished, mixing CG 2D and 3D images flwalessly and in a natural way for the viewer. Full 16:9 aspect ratio makes Solid State Society a nice visual experience on SD televisions and displays and also on HD with the use of a DVD Player or A/V Receiver with an integrated upscaler. The use witihin the movie of ""virtual"" lens, and depth-of-view also make for a nice real-life approach to express something in animation instead of live-action. Voice dubbing in japanese and english is quite well done, in fact, I really suggest having a first view in english (if you're somewhat new to the series) then watching it in japanese with subtitles. 5.1 surround (Dolby) sound is supported on both languages and overall sound mixing is of high quality, considering the problems that lip-syncing usually has. The musical score, made by Yoko Kano, a famous japanese musician and composer, deepens the dark enviroment of the movie itself and enhances the plot and characters. Synthethisers, beats and woman-sung chorus, mixed with powerful sound effects also provide a great sound experience. Overall it's a great production worth of watching not just once, but many times.

The Limited Edition contains the movie disc, an extras disc with interviews, designs, and other bonus content, and a original soundtrack CD by Yoko Kano, all in a metal-like jewel box. However, I've rated it 4 stars since the soundtrack does not contains a printed playlist nor any additional info. Also it doesn't come with other value-adding bonus (like postcards, some kind of book, plastic figures...) aside from the noted above. For the hardcore fans and collectors I suggest you to wait for a re-edition or similar of it.

Overall, the movie itself is a must for the fans of the series. It is also a must for sci-fi lovers or anime lovers, but make sure you get Stand Alone Complex (S1 and S2) at least first (also I suggest that to those who have just watched the two first movies or read the manga only).",1185753600,3,5311,4.913043478260869

2827442,4,B000PMGNK4,"Yet another entry in the acclaimed franchise.  This one is surprisingly well crafted.  Well paced, with good music, animations and political implications tied to Japanese domestic issues--just as expected from Ghost in the Shell.  Considering the time limit, all characters get a fair share of diologue (again smooth and sophisticated) and development.  There are some changes that some characters go through but I won't spoil specifics.  The story is engaging and kept me in suspense.  Action is sparse but Ghost in the Shell isn't about explosive Hollywood acion; rather, it draws it from imminent political danger, intensive diologue and suspensful story.  I should mention that I only watch Japanese original versions of anime, not English dubbed, so I don't know how appealing those are.",1185667200,,792,5.338709677419355

Also, the story seemed a little off to me, I don't know if it was intentional given the plot line (don't want to spoil it for you).

Pretty good overall though.",1185494400,,463,3.978494623655914
2827445,4,B000PMGNK4,"Those who have been following the ""Ghost in the Shell"" film and TV adaptations know that ""Ghost in the Shell - Solid State Society"" follows the ""Stand Alone Complex"" narrative arc.  Unlike the two previous films (which belonged to an arc of their own), ""Solid State Society"", like the aforementioned television series, is extremely fast-paced, heavy in dialogue, and complex in plot.

For the average viewer, ""Solid State Society"" might pose far too much of a puzzle to be enjoyable: who is this character?  why does he matter?  what in the world is going on here?  who is this Puppeteer everyone keeps talking about?

But for the GiTS fan, especially a ""Stand Alone Complex"" fan, this film is extraordinary.  Picture, if you will, taking 4 full episodes of GiTS:SAC, giving them one solid plot with a beginning, middle, and end, and increasing the production value tenfold.  That's what this film is, essentially: like the ""Star Trek"" movies, it's not really much different than the series, but it looks, feels, and sounds far better than any individual episode.

LIMITED EDITION NOTES:

The Limited edition comes with a DTS audio track as well as the usual 5.1 track.  Definitely excellent sound if you have the audio equipment.  The second DVD includes a ridiculous number of extras, most of which I haven't bothered to watch.  But the great thing about the Limited Edition is the included Soundtrack CD.  It's very J-Pop/Techno/Fusion/Whatever, but it has certainly grown on me (and has a reserved spot in my car's CD set).

FINAL WORD:

If you like the ""Stand Alone Complex"" series, and have watched a majority of it, you ought to see this film.  And if you're a fan of the show's music, this particular edition of the movie is by far worth the extra cost.",1185408000,7,1761,4.816666666666666

A series of suicides leads Togusa and crew to the Puppeteer, an untracable entity with no motive at the time. The story gets quite more dramatic as problems seem to arise and stagger Section 9 to the point of having no leads for the Puppeteer problem. The story goes on forth like this and the last 40 minutes in probably the most intuitive and thought out since the first Ghost in the Shell movie came out. Although the first 2 movies and this have two varying storylines. This movie has felt like a true to life movie of Ghost in the Shell.

2827454,4,B000PMGNK4,"So, the first thing I have to say is yes, I am glad I bought it.  However, don't make the same mistake I made... I, for no good reason, assumed that the team who created GITS: Innocence created GITS: SSS.  Wrong!!!  Do not expect the same dramatic, philosophical, and artistic depth and sophistication found in GITS: Innocence.

The team that created this film is the same team that generates the series.  As a matter of fact, this film has a ""made-for-TV"" feel about it.  It seems as if two individual stories were grafted together as one which may account for some of the disharmony.  It also felt somewhat episodic, as if filmed so that it  could be easily serialized.  (As an aside...The involvement of Nissan makes me a little nervous for the future, hopefully the studio doesn't lose their artistic vision and swing too far to the commercial side.  The concept cars were cool but they weren't anything the art team couldn't have created on their own.  With the exception of one scene, the cars simply were not integral to the film.)

Now, with all of that said, I love the series.  This film is on par with caliber of the 2nd season.  The art, audio, general plot, English dubbing, etc. is top notch.  (Writing?  Well...the continuity people responsible for ensuring that the story flows smoothly could have tightened things up a bit.)

If you love the series, you'll love this movie.

2827455,2,B000PMGNK4,"Ghost in the Shell's success has always been a bit of a fluke, as it was to be Appleseed that was Shirow's magnum opus.  I really wanted to like Solid State Society, I really did, but just found it to be very lacking.

The first season of Stand Alone was amazing, as it managed to capture some of the feel of the comic: counter terrorist ops fighting terrorists and drinkin a cold one afterwards.  Second season was passable, grasping at straws to develop characters meant to be nothing more than a talking head or plot device, plus the inclusion of a Mary Sue villain.

Still, I'd hoped that all the money that the GitS property has made studio IG over the years could've produced something better than what was essentially an almost two hour episode of Stand Alone with at most three minutes of amazing action animation.

Had they simply retold the classic Puppet Master story from the comic using the Stand Alone characters, it could've been a much better movie.  The further GitS breaks from the original source material (specifically the original comic run), generally the weaker it becomes.  I can't help but think that by borrowing more heavily from Man Machine Interface (particularly the whole rogue Motoko and Motoko's split consciousness bit), Solid State Society lost the potential to be an action packed thriller to wrap up the series in a hail of gun-fire and car chases.  It all felt rather unsatisfying.

After the unyieldingly convoluted, pandering, and nearly unreadable debacle that was Man Machine Interface, I hope, as a Shirow fan, that the Ghost in the Shell franchise can be laid to rest with some of its dignity in tact; a solemn procession that should not end with a 21 gun salute, but rather a crudely drawn Batou going colon ""d"" while firing a miniature shoulder mounted rocket into the air.",1183334400,7,1819,4.767515923566879

Some hard hitting criminal is up to something with people dying or disappearing or simply just being erased from the sea of information.  The Major is missing AND their is a new criminal about, who could it be?

Well, this film take political science fiction to its height, and also does very nicely with the technology and action aspects.  And the ending is friggin phenomenal.  Sure the GIS has always been wonderful with its ability to paint the world in shades of gray, or at least to say that sometimes the black is the better choice over the white, but in this story, the viewer will find it impossible to make a judement call on which side was fighting for the greater good.

Unfortunately GITS has moved beyond the standalone complex cannon into Arise, which is just terrible in comparison. This movie is like the final taste of the standalone complex universe that I love, but it's bittersweet because you know how much better it would have been as a full season.
