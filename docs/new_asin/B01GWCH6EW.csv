Gregory House MD is a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the Dr. Watson to record the events. The location is the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Everybody lies is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, fictional reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? There is a recurring plot. A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem and the cure.

Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctors mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year in 1994 from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was about half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count. This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses.
