When we get to the plot of the film, I found that, unfortunately, I simply didn't care about the characters or the drama surrounding them.",1199145600,6,267,4.448979591836735
7896247,4,630584545X,"First, I rate this 4 stars because the plot is similar to other movies in this genre. It is a very enjoyable movie! The women are beautiful & leave little if anything to the imagination. The movie is likely to be classed as unrated. It's a movie for adults. The atmosphere is good and the lighting too. I've so far watched the DVD 1 time. I'm sure to view it many more times. If you have friends to entertain and want a DVD with sexy ladies and a story that requires minimal concentration to understand buy this movie!",1097193600,29,518,4.295918367346939
7896248,1,630584545X,"This movie was recommended as one that would appeal to both men and women.  Erotic, but not ""in-your-face"" like more hardcore movies.  Unfortunately, this movie tried to be too many things to too many people and instead ended up failing at everything.  At its heart is the marriage of a professional couple that lacks passion.  The wife ends up in a lesbian affair with a pretty photographer.  But things turn quite weird when the husband becomes involved.  A bizarre love triangle is formed, and the movie goes from romantic to dramatic to just plain weird.  I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but the plot twists can be seen a mile away.  And to make matters worse, the ending is downright depressing (though by this time, any semblance of caring for the main characters has all but vanished).
Don't waste your time with this one.",988329600,66,846,4.630872483221476
