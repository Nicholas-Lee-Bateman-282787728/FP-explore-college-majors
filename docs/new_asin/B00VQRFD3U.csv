Once you get past the editing issues (often too kinetic, loud, and stuck on the last person still speaking, as if buffering in-days-of-old), you hear from some 'real' moms, a couple on-the-fence-about-kids folks, and authors who talk about how and why women are not having kids, then lament about how grand, and hard, motherhood is; a couple bitter moms themselves that wouldn't trade the experience for the world (way to pivot on honing in on a subject!). And, big surprise alert: men who get involved in child rearing (hands-on-diapers involved, schlepping to/from doctor etc.) make for happier moms, and staying partnerships; um, duh.

Plus, for all the banter, this is a pro-baby film. No standing by those who decide child bearing is not for them. Instead, a small undertone of Do It For Society if nothing else bleeds through. Eh.

Motherhood is a choice. It is explored here a tad off-kilter; great interviews, great cartoons, bad editing, and too, ultimately, scolding, of those who 100% choose not too. All that being said, if you are kinda, maybe, thinking of, doing the whole unit gig, see this absolutely. Snack recommendation: Ortho Novum",1433808000,,1204,5.015
