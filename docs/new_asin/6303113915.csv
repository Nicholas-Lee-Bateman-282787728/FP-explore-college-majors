7837825,5,6303113915,"Leonard Maltin provides a brief commentary before this film.

""Birthday Blues"" from 1932, begins this tape, a funny, fast, and popular short from the series. It stars Dickie and Spanky, children whose father has forgotten their mother's birthday. They decide to find a way to buy her a present. Stymie gives them the bright idea to bake a cake filled with prizes for the guests. What is concocted is a strange square cake which contracts making a ""weep-wow"" sound. The guests get their prizes, the boys buy their mother an early 20s style dress, and their mother has a happy birthday. This is a wonderful short filled with great lines and great sight comedy.

""For Pete's Sake"" from 1934 is the second short. It stars Wally Albright as the gang leader, out to get little Marianne a new dolly when bully Leonard breaks her old one. However, Leonard's father owns the toy shop, and Leonard wants Pete the Pup for payment. The gang tries to get a job doing odd jobs in a lazy man's backyard, but they only destroy the scenery. In the end, all is well. This is a fast paced comedy which shines due to the presence of smart alecs Scotty and Spanky.

The third short on this tape is ""The Lucky Corner"" from 1936, and excellent ""putting on a show"" short. The gang is competing with Leonard and his cranky father with their lemonaide stand. When they are moved to a desolate corner, the gang decides to draw attention to themselves by performing a variety show complete with parade, tap dances, and singing. The cast is excellent; Buckwheat is great in his scenes despite very few lines, Alfalfa is an ever comedic singer, and Scotty is cute as ever.

""Arbor Day"" from the same year is the final short on the tape. It also features a show in honor of Arbor Day. However, the gang aren't the only cast members. This short features two midgets who appeared in several shorts. In this one, they want to escape the monotony of a sideshow act and disguise themselves as children. Unfortunately for them, the truant officer believes their disguise all too well and carts them off to school. The Arbor Day show bores them to tears although it is filled with some very cute scenes. This film is not a riot but more of a sitcom type of comedy.",1129680000,5,2226,4.543640897755611
