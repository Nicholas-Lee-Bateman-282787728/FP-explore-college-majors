I only wish that the DVD had subtitles so I could learn the words to some of the songs, especially the song ""I'll Be Your Hero""",1407801600,,157,3.90625

7923255,4,B00004TYYG,"First off the images are confusing, this David Copperfield is the one with the cartoon cats. Furries and a cheese factory have little to do with Dickens and outside of using some names and plot points neither does the story. On one hand it doesn't matter, Y7 would be a good rating as some of the scenes about the Moldies and a Cheese Monster might worry some kids so watch it with them the first time.

The animation is good coming from Canada instead of Japan or Korea for a change but at times the sync is just slightly off as it may have been first made for the French audio track that was included on my region 1 DVD.

The english audio has Howie Mandel, Michael York, and Andrea Martin among what sound to be other stalwarts of animation, the surprise inclusion of Julian Lennon (John's son) is welcome. He sounds like he missed a calling as he brings true emotion to his character, and in a way did as no one else offered him voice work until he narrated Whaledreamers which he produced. For the two songs Julian sings, one is done twice, he manages but gets squashed a bit in the duet with Sheena Easton due to poor mixing.

This may be pushing it with obscure Beatles collectables but it can find its place next to Yellow Submarine on toon movie night.",1243900800,2,1261,4.357446808510638
