7912187,5,B00000JGKH,"James Coburn provides a startling real portrayal of an abusive father who destroys the lives of his wife and two sons. Played by Nick Nolte and Willem DeFoe.  The abusive Coburn character  takes a part of their dignity and their lives.
It was so real to watch this.  It shows how abuse can tear the soul and dreams from those who are in the path of ""Whitehouse"" the character played by Coburn. Nick Nolte's performace was very on the mark. It showed a man without confidence and no place in his life besides being the only police officer in the town. He wasn't even respected by anyone of his co workers.
There was a very chilling scene in the movie when Coburn's character pretended not to notice his wife's passing in his own home.  It's not the most uplifting film to watch but is a testament as to how vile and abusive fathers destroy every family member. The only one who came out of this was DeFoe's character. He moved very far away from his father as soon as he could.  There is a lot of un Hollywood reality in this one.",1014595200,3,1029,4.338541666666667
7912188,5,B00000JGKH,"What a powerful movie ""Affliction"" is. Paul Shrader, the director and writer of the screenplay from Russell Bank's bestseller, has given us a film of painful, overwhelming power. Every scene rings true. One wants to turn away, because these characters radiate such force and power. Nick Nolte is tremendous, giving having a toothache a bad name. This story puts to rest the eroneous thought that is is nicer to live in smaller towns. Wade Woodhouse, Nolte's character, can't escape his upbringing nor this town, and at every turn he tries and fails to connect with its people. James Coburn, as Nolte's father, has given a brilliant performance, and won a well-deserved Academy Award. Every time Coburn is on screen, we want to run or cover our ears; he is so brutal and real that he practically leaps off the screen, with his meaness, pettiness, and raw brutality. Sissy Spacek is also marvelous as Wade's girlfriend, who finally has to get away from him to survive and maintain her own sanity. Many of the supporting actors are unkonown but uniformly excellent, many having French accents, appropriate to the region of the story (New England but starkly shot in Canada) and not one performance rings false. Set in winter, the story marches painfully to its conclusion and no matter what he tries, Wade is haunted by his father's violence and inability to make the correct decision. ""Affliction"" is a powerful, painful vision, one of the most searing put on screen in years. It has Paul Shrader's moral sensitivity and intelligence and don't be put off my its themes and actions. We all can learn something from this film and not repeat mistakes of others that raise us or come before us, and not be trapped by the past. Highly recommended.",973123200,,1740,4.842281879194631
7912189,2,B00000JGKH,"Bleak account of how a violent childhood determines the life of small town cop Nick Nolte. Short on sentiment and a little slow, the film is, nevertheless, watchable and a reasonably effective indictment of child  abuse. Nolte delivers a surpisingly intense performance and James Coburn  oozes malice as his despicable father.",962496000,,326,5.372549019607843
