Sent this to my son who lives out in the middle of no where in Colorado for Christmas. What a disappointment.!! Why would you sell a DVD that won't play on USA equipment??",1451606400,2,305,4.1

6385420,5,B00JPFTRB4,"Fargo was an excellent series and more than lived up to the movie that it is based on. Everything about the series was awesome and the acting quality was on par with such shows like Game of Thrones, Turn, and The Walking Dead, just to name a few. Since the details of the blu-ray have not been released yet, this is a review of the series only, but when I receive my copy I will update my review. If you haven't seen it yet and you liked the classic film of the same name, then you will love the series.
Update:
