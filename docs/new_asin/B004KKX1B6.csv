8433011,1,B004KKX1B6,"When I bought a DVD from Amazon, my last thought was to check what region code it was made for and whether or not it would play on my dvd player. I guess you learn something new everyday. If you are in the USA, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! It will not play on your machine and the company will not take it back if it has been opened. Of course it is opened, this is how I knew it would not play on my machine. Lesson learned for me, I will check the region a DVD is made in before buying it.",1458518400,4,483,3.6990291262135924

8433016,5,B004KKX1B6,"The Peppa Pig cartoons are consistently outstanding.  The characters are endearing, the plots are simple but engaging, and the humor is appealing (albeit in different ways) to both children and adults.  One of the best features of Peppa Pig is although it includes gentle cues to children (and parents!) on appropriate and positive behavior, these are never presented in a forced or heavy-handed way.  The little secret we have is that my wife and I watch these wonderful cartoons ourselves... not a child in sight when we're there viewing and enjoying them.  This disk is among the more recent releases, and we can honestly say that the quality continues at the same high level as ever.  NOTE: Please make sure you have a DVD player that will accept Region 2 disks before buying this.  You will not be able to view it on standard NTSC (American) players.",1391212800,2,855,4.782312925170068
