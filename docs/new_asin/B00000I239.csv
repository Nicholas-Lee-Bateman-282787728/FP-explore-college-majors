7909385,3,B00000I239,"Moderately entertaining misfire from director Don Siegel sees him working with one of the best and most underrated leading men of the era, Michael Caine for the first and only time.  Caine plays a security services officer whose son is kidnapped--the kidnappers want the exact sum in diamonds that his department head Cedric Harper (a wonderfully oily Donald Pleasence) acquired for another operation, meaning the kidnapper has an inside man--and the evidence eventually suggests that it's Michael Caine's Major Tarrant.

The first half of The Black Windmill chugs along at a persistent clip but it's all plotting that really isn't very interesting.  During the second half things pick up as Don Siegel finally gets to stage some action scenes but the whole thing is way too complicated for its own good.  The film grinds down to a surprisingly abrupt ending that suggests there may have been some post production tinkering--or maybe the material simply wasn't a great fit for Don Siegel's talents and he made exactly the best movie that he could.

Michael Caine is in prime Get Carter form as a government agent who will do whatever it takes to get back his son but the kidnapping yields very little in the way of suspense, partly because it's never clear that the boy is actually in all that much danger (his school friend who was snatched at the same time was released traumatized but otherwise unharmed) and partly because the kidnapping mostly takes a back seat to the intrigue regarding who the traitor is that is maneuvering to get the diamonds--and once the identity of the mastermind is revealed it's extremely anticlimactic at best.

John Vernon, a Don Siegel vet from Dirty Harry and Charley Varrick is fine as the heavy who actually carries out the kidnapping but he simply isn't given enough to do to be a great villain.  Delphine Seyrig is also underutilized as his primary accomplice.  Nobody in the supporting cast besides Donald Pleasence really makes much of an impression--they're pretty much just faces on hand to keep the plot moving.

The Black Windmill isn't exactly bad--Michael Caine is entertaining to watch and Don Siegel gets to stage some reasonably exciting action sequences but the whole thing can't help but feel like a missed opportunity considering the talent involved.  The Black Windmill is a perfectly capable time-waster as long as you aren't expecting much more.",1422144000,,2401,4.994987468671679

7909387,4,B00000I239,"The story line was rather weak. The best part was when Michael Caine was escaping and he stopped, looked back at the one that was chasing him and gave him a smile.
I remember this movie from a long, long time ago. I wasn't as good as I thought it was. The action seen at the end of the movie went rather quickly. Still I liked the 2 hours setting down and watching it.
Now this want play on just any old DVD or Blu-ray player. It has to be a region DVD/Blu-ray player, however A region player is worth Investing. Make sure it is a 3com-3d Blu-ray player. It's worth the extra bucks to have it'

7909388,5,B00000I239,"If you're a fan of Michael Caine and/or director Don Siegel (DIRTY HARRY), this movie is a rare gem in the spy/suspense genre. In a plot reminiscent of early Hitchock films, Caine plays a spy whose son is kidnapped. His agency refuses to help so he is forced to track down his son and the perpetrators himself. European locations, Michael Caine's strong performance, and Siegel's taut direction make this movie a must-see for fans of the genre. THE BLACK WINDMILL is unavailable on DVD in the U.S. If you have a Region 2 or region-free player, this UK release from Universal is a great way to see this rare movie in its original widescreen glory.",1330646400,2,646,4.626086956521739
7909389,5,B00000I239,"I've watched many Michael Caine movies and this certainly is one of his better films, my second favorite (with ""Hannah and her Sisters"" being my favorite Michael Caine film).
The plot is very captivating, the actors very well cast and the locations are marvellous, especially the scenes filmed inside the windmill.
I would rate ""Hannah and her Sisters"" with 6 stars, this one definitely 5 stars, but ""Alfie"" only 2 stars although it's very popular, but just not my cup of tea.",1305417600,,476,4.817073170731708
7909390,3,B00000I239,"The Black Windmill has a workable premise, an unspectacularly decent cast (Delphine Seyrig, Donald Pleasance, Janet Suzman, Clive Revill, Dennis Quilley, Edward Hardwicke and Joss Ackland among them) and a good director in Don Siegel, but it never catches fire. Michael Caine, playing a very different spy to Harry Palmer - more of a middle class career army officer who never needed to be blackmailed into the job - finds himself being set up by the vicious kidnappers of his young son to steal some diamonds intended for some dubious operation, eventually finding himself having to avoid his employers, the French and British police and take out the very bad guys (hey, it is John Vernon). All of which sounds at least more energetic than the film actually is. It moves along with competence, dotting the 'i's and crossing the 't's, but even though a surprising amount happens in the last half hour, it never seems to develop any tension or urgency. Along the way there's a nice Sean Connery joke and a neat scene that manages to reference both The sound of Music and Caine's own Battle of Britain, but the good Scope composition and the typical 70s Roy Budd score make more of an impression than anything else in the film.

Uiniversal's Region 2 PAL DVD has no extras, but it does boast a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer that at least ensures the film looks its best and has none of the panning-and-scanning problems of the TV prints.",1171584000,2,1437,4.748
7909391,5,B00000I239,"For this work, scenes of ""action"", a Don Siegel specialty, are less significant than those that generate characterization and plot, functioning to release tension rather than keep it at bay, although the director's customary taut pacing and stoniness are here, within a twisty story largely faithful to its source, a Clive Egleton novel: ""Seven Days to a Killing"", strongly scripted by Leigh Vance to further define the character-focussed film.  A cleverly fresh storyline involves a kidnapping, the victim being son of MI-5 operative John Tarrant (Michael Caine), with a ransom demand for greater than one half million pounds worth of uncut diamonds that are resting within a Defence Ministry safe, as an unknown traitorous official has informed the abductors, with subsequent dual scenario devices of Tarrant's struggle to retrieve his son held by illicit arms syndicate villains, along with Ministry efforts to culpably link Tarrant with the conspiracy.  The film benefits from attention to continuity, no loose ends rupturing one's concentration, with heed to detail perhaps its primary strength, yet telling contributions come from many, including players Caine, who adds a needed element of engagement to his Harry Palmer persona, Delphine Seyrig giving a splendidly nuanced performance as companion of the principal evildoer (played with effectual guile by John Vernon), and Donald Pleasence earning the acting laurels here as a dispassionate MI-5 security chief, along with Clive Revill, Joss Ackland, and ever intense Janet Suzman.  Siegel's hand is apparent in the spare deployment of music, with scoring and silence each appropriately employed; palette and filter for well-composed cinematography and montage (shooting is in London, Paris and the Sussex countryside); a symbolic use of clothing colours; and accomplished post-production efforts, all increasing the worth of a piece undervalued by some reviewers, indeed by Caine himself, unfortunate in the event as the film is one of Siegel's finest, his skill with improvisation mating well with capable workmanship.",1100044800,11,2079,5.593650793650793
