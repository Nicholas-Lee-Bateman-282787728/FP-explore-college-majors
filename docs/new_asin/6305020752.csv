However, non of what was emotionally developed at the beginning of the movie ever made it to the end because in the middle of the movie, it just became about a major fire at an industrial warehouse and how these fire fighters fought their way out, the end.  It was as if I watched two movies, one in which there were character development and a second movie with special effects about fire fighters trying to survive a fire over a 30 minute period.  As an audience you are seeing the relationships the fire fighters have with their families and friends at the beginning and then suddenly all those people disappeared from the movie in the middle.  When you get to the end, you're like ""what?, that's it?""  It's too bad because this could have been a great movie if they shortened the fire scene in the industrial warehouse and relate the fire to how it affected everyone's relationships.",1508371200,,1051,4.623655913978495

7880588,3,6305020752,"Lau Ching-Wan stars in director Johnnie To's look at fire fighters in Hong Kong.  And this is much better than Ron Howard's ""Backdraft.""  The final warehouse fire is incredible. However, to get there, one has to  sit through some melodramas involving several members of Lau's team (which  is said to be jinxed) and some minor emergencies (a car accident, an  elevator collapse). Fortunately, these incidents and the characters are  worth watching. Nonetheless, it's the warehouse fire that pays off.  The DVD  also includes an un-subtitled documentary about the filming.",957398400,8,570,5.325842696629214
