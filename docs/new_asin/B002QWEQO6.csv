The night Black Flag played, many many, non regulars showed up from Orange Park, Mandarin, etc.  and when we started the pit, they didn't know what to do or what was going on.  75% of them left...it was great.  I would have made a few different choices from those years but when I watch this DVD it makes me a bit sad and  I long for those days.",1524355200,,476,4.119565217391305
8378029,5,B002QWEQO6,"I was part of the Jax punk/ Blighted Area scene and played many gigs with Ray and The Switchblades in the early eighties.  SS was one of the heaviest, craziest bands i have ever seen.  Every show was a riot of raw energy and Raw was the ultimate punk rock showman.
This documentary highlights some moments and gives some insight on a talented man and band that while they had the goods to make it, unfortunately did not have any business sense and really didn't give a s*** which made them that more appealing.  Sadly, their is very little media documenting that era so this DVD will give you a rare glimpse into this by gone scene.  RAY RIP.",1391644800,,642,4.369747899159663
8378030,5,B002QWEQO6,"This is such an interesting documentary.  For me, I left Jacksonville in 1984, but there were many fun times at  Manapaders/Blighted Area and others, that I fondly remember.  When I visited San Francisco around 90ish, I was surprised to see Stevie Stilleto's name all over the place (and yes, I thought Steve Galagher was him, not Ray).  Unfortunately, they weren't playing when I was there, but it is now all documented me for to see what I missed, and what a story.  They really did make the big time.  I'm so happy for Ray, but I hope he is still with us?  I'd love to see him again, in person.  But this is 2nd best.  Hey - where's Jackie, the  #1 fan from back in the day?!!!!!

I X you OUT!!!!! Xoxoxo",1317254400,2,707,4.28030303030303
