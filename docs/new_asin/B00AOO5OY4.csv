5463373,3,B00AOO5OY4,"""Strangers in the Night"" skillfully fits the film noir genre. Admittedly, the ending is rushed--huddled--but this is OK: the film isn't a who-done-it. Pro acting all around, sharply observed atmospheric photography. A good place to begin is you're interested in the historic evolution of film noir.",1374105600,3,298,5.5

LOOKING FOR ANOTHER OLDIE. TV MOVIE GOLDEN GATE MJRDERS.  CANNOT FIND.  LB",1369699200,,166,5.3076923076923075
5463375,4,B00AOO5OY4,This is a good movie.  The description calls it a Film Noir but it is more of a regular drama.  A Marine goes to met the woman he became pen pals with and meets everyone but her.  I was impressed with the quality of the movie.  It doesn't say if it was restored but it looks unbelievable for a 1944 movie!,1369094400,14,305,3.9508196721311477
5463376,1,B00AOO5OY4,I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE.  IT WAS RIDICULOUS AND TOTALLY UNBELIEVEABLE.  A WASTE OF SCREEN TIME AND MY MONEY TOO.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I STILL LOVE AMAZON THOUGH!!!,1367798400,,188,4.4411764705882355
5463377,4,B00AOO5OY4,"This movie has a great plot and it is one of those you would never figure out until the end. The acting is very good as is the sound and picture. This one you will want to watch over and over as time goes by. It won't get old. This is a movie with some real mystery in a large mansion. This gothic, haunting mystery falls within the gothic and haunting mystery of the tradition of Hitchcock's Rebecca.",1367798400,4,401,4.153846153846154
5463378,3,B00AOO5OY4,"I love film noir and old mystery horror and the review of this looked good.
I wanted to like this movie and it's not that bad it's just not very good.
The story is okay but the writing and acting is just well....boring...there
really is no mystery or scary moments in this and you keep waiting for it to
get going and it's over....and the ending is nothing surprising...i will watch
again maybe change my mind but ....i would suggest Gun for Hire, Quicksand,
Dark Corner, Scarlett Street, Black widow, Dark Angel,Dead Ringer all film noir classics.",1366502400,2,548,4.65979381443299
5463379,4,B00AOO5OY4,Older movie with a pretty good storyline. It's basically a mystery with a simple twist. Not hard to figure it out but still enjoyable to watch,1366156800,2,142,4.5

5463381,5,B00AOO5OY4,"The setting, the characters, the story,,,the house on the edge of the cliff!!  When you see that house on the edge of the cliff you know it's going to be a great movie!!!!!",1362700800,13,172,4.212121212121212
5463382,4,B00AOO5OY4,"This clever little noir is Anthony Mann's first feature film, and it is very entertaining.....the last two minutes strain credulity; however, fans of Mann's masterpieces know that Swiss clock plotting was never his real interest...............of all mid 20th century genre directors he brought Shakespearean character arcs and conflict to the western and crime melodrama and by doing so elevated them to a level of art that has not since been replicated.  Why this guy is not a household name like
Wilder, Ford, and Hitchcock is beyond my comprehension.

Don't expect T Men or Naked Spur.......this film is not at that level..........If you are a fan of Mann's movies, this is a must have as you can see several tropes that are used in later better known films............if you have no idea who Anthony Mann is get Naked Spur and watch it first..................if you like it like I think you will, you will want to see every movie he ever made:)

Olive films has put out a VERY nice looking transfer of this movie........I wish TMen and some of his other early noirs looked this good on DVD.. .",1362009600,36,1097,4.824468085106383

8555447,3,B00AOO5OY4,"A good film--it had so much more potential than came to pass, but an enjoyable watch.",1463356800,,85,4.375
8555448,4,B00AOO5OY4,"Yes, as previous reviewers have noted, this is a B-movie, with a low budget & lesser-known actors -- but it's also a wonderful example of what a gifted director could do with limited resources. Anthony Mann drenches the film with shadows & atmosphere, provides a couple of jolts that physically startled me, and makes the increasingly far-fetched nature of the storyline actually work in its favor as the film slides from mystery into pure Gothic. The rushed final scene is worthy of Poe. And the acting is quite impressive, with Helene Thimig offering one of the most gleefully insane embodiments of obsessed malevolence that I've seen in a long time; while Virginia Grey is both stunningly beautiful & a strong, intelligent woman as the town's new female doctor. William Terry is an average, affable, nice guy whose blandness is a virtue -- he's a goodhearted, basically ordinary young man out of his depth among such formidable females -- someone made for sunny days plunged into a very dark situation indeed. Add to that the wonderful matte painting of the mysterious mansion of the seaside cliff, and you've got a fever dream (or nightmare) that doesn't make much waking, logical sense, but is emotionally intense & very real in its depiction of the tortured, demented (un)reality that's been woven by a broken mind. Highly recommended!",1453766400,2,1341,4.991071428571429
8555449,4,B00AOO5OY4,"Not an edge of your seat thriller,  but  quite enjoyable.  Only about an hour long, with excellent  quality.  Highly  recommended.",1438732800,,130,5.25
8555450,1,B00AOO5OY4,"I see the word Noir and an comparison to a Hitchcock setting in the description and I immediately believe the film must be great.  NOT!  Well, at least not in this case.

The plot was silly and predictable and the acting was awful.  The only good thing about this film is that it is in Black & White and it only lasts 56mins.",1424390400,,325,4.111111111111111
8555451,5,B00AOO5OY4,Great old movie at a reasonable price.,1410566400,2,38,4.571428571428571
8555452,5,B00AOO5OY4,The DVD is in great shape with fantastic quality.  The movie was good but a little slow.  I would have put this in my collection anyway.,1397606400,,136,4.1923076923076925
8555453,5,B00AOO5OY4,"Arrived today and have not as yet watched, but anticipate that it will be very good.  The song that was written is perhaps a part of the movie.

8555454,4,B00AOO5OY4,"A haunting little gothic mystery, 'Strangers in the Night' (1944) isn't so much noir as it is psychological suspense/drama in the vein of Hitchcock's 'Suspicion' and 'Rebecca' and obscure one-offs like 1944's 'Guest in the House,' 1946's 'The Strange Woman' and 1945's 'The Woman Who Came Back,' with some excellent cinematographic compositions that recall those of its true-noir contemporaries.  Classifying it as noir for marketing purposes actually does a disservice to the legacy of its prolific director, Anthony Mann ('Raw Deal,' 'The Black Book,' 'The Man from Laramie,' 'El Cid'), who contributed top material across numerous genres over the course of his long, eclectic career.  That said, 'Strangers' is an intriguing, satisfying-- though, at only 56 minutes, slight-- Republic Pictures production whose primary weakness comes by way of moments of B-picture-quality acting and writing.  3-plus stars.  As Olive Films doesn't seem to do much in terms of restoration, I have to assume the source print they found was in fantastic shape because the image is clean and sharp, showing few signs of age, with clear audio.  No extras.  Content and pedigree plus presentation rounds up to 4 stars.",1379808000,18,1199,5.351063829787234
