3875711,2,B002935GI2,"This probably deserves 3 stars but I had to give it 2 because I expected more. I could only get through about 30 minutes or so before I turned it off. If you have an abundance of time to kill or are extremely high then check it out. The main point of the movie was established in the first 15 minutes, after that it was just boring. This would have been a very thought provoking short film.",1254182400,6,390,4.077922077922078
3875712,4,B002935GI2,"I enjoyed this, but to classify this as a comedy seems wrong to me.  There were funny moments, but I would compare it less to Idiocracy and more to Synecdoche New York, where the drama made more of an impact than the humor.  It was just odd enough to keep my attention at first, and it ended up being a very sweet, thoughtful experience.  Zach really did a great job as the lead actor here.  Judy and Mia knocked their parts out of the park, and the supporting cast was also good.  I admit it was slow here and there, but still very good.

Another review mentioned the poor production value, and to an extent they are right.  For an independent film I thought the visual quality was actually quite good, but the sound (at least on my copy) is not the best.  I had to turn my TV almost all the way up to hear the dialogue in many scenes, followed by a leap for the remote when the music started, which was very loud.  It is a shame that they couldn't get more support for this.  Still, I didn't mind when the movie ended up being pretty good.",1250640000,3,1041,4.16
3875713,5,B002935GI2,"Ever wonder what a nuclearized, undereducated, unsatisfying cubicle culture looks like?

Then go to work.

Or, you can watch Visioneers, a funhouse reflection of an unfunny reality. There's a new writer/director family duo on the block, the Drake Brothers, and Visioneers is a promising beginning for them, possibly joining the Coens, the Wachowskis, Wes Anderson and Richard Kelly as cinematic prophets of doom.

Visioneers comes stickered with a reference to ""the Hangover"", a clever way to sucker buyers and renters into thinking this might be a better than average lowbrow romp. Consequently, there's going to be more than a few negative reviews of this from dunderheads who won't be getting what they want, in that case. Score one for cynical marketing that will make a few bucks for the cast and creators-finance the smart on the backs of the dumb, a toxic process in many cases, but not here. It's healthy to get off on Visioneers.",1250467200,,938,5.0
3875714,1,B002935GI2,"This movie was not for me.  I loved Idocracy, and to try to compare that to this is reprehensible.  No production value at all.  I guess the movie was beyond me, it was so far and away good, that it came around and landed on the garbage side to me.  The trigger pulling was not funny, it was dumb.

I guess I had such high expectations that when they failed to deliver on anything, it just seemed that much more disappointing.  Woo hoo lets flip everyone off cuz thats the logo...  ya.

3875715,5,B002935GI2,"I've been among the dedicated fans Zach Galifianakis' ingenious comedy for a few years now, and it seems like the rest of the world is now catching up. Zach was the standout element in this summer's The Hangover (a film which on the whole I wasn't too impressed by). In Visioneers, though, Zach is the leading man and proves he can carry a subtle, darkly comic role as George Washington Winsterhammerman, a corporate drone working for the Jeffers Corporation, the largest and friendliest and most profitable corporation in the history of all mankind.

This film is fresh, unexpected and sincere. With throwbacks to Brazil, Schizopolis and (underrated) Idiocracy, Visioneers builds a universe that has just enough similarity to our own to feel genuine, but is far enough out there to descend into total chaos.",1248220800,8,808,5.029850746268656

3875717,4,B002935GI2,"Great movie. I stumbled upon this actually looking for a goofy, mindless, comedy to watch on my phone before bed...Now I'm still up thinking about it, writing this review, and giggling out loud over the chaos. A very deep movie with some laugh-out-loud moments. I feel this movie on some level almost daily, so it really held my attention. Not from my job, per se, but from all of the mundane aspects of every day life. The compromises. The guilt. We have become a society of selfish zombies, but even our selfishness has become openly tedious and unenjoyable. It's like the world/humanity has died. Some of us will explode, but maybe those who remain will be reborn into a new era where we appreciate and value each other and the abundance of life. Where we stop killing the planet and each other out of greed and fear. Where we all realize that we would all be happier if everyone had what they needed... I subtracted one star for the surprisingly weak, rushed, tacked on, love story ending. But for that, this movie was perfect.

Every variation of work I have experience with fits this film in all sorts of ways. It's nice to see work as it is put in more of a black and white  rather than a grey. VISIONEERS just gets right down to the nut cutting and puts it as it is LOUD and clear right in your face! Good to see this unique film come to be, one of a kind.

What it is, is abstract. It doesn't really fit into any category I can think of. It's very strange. But it is beautiful. I think you will really appreciate the value of this film if you work a mundane, pointless job. Too many films nowadays tell their stories so blatantly, that everyone watching it pulls the same thing from them.

3875732,5,B002935GI2,"I am confused by many of the negative reviews - the plot line was tight, unified and engaging.  The sound quality, underscoring and music is exceptional.  The story far from loses its way, but hits its stride as life truly falls apart around the main characters.  An invisible son and hippie brother?  De rigueur now days.  Corporate mind control?  Check.  Late capitalism has its perils, and the reviews here seem to show that only some of us are ready.  Of course, the fact that I am reviewing this on Amazon means you should most likely ignore it anyway.  Anyone who reads contemporary philosophy will draw (most likely intentional) parallels between Zizek's warnings on Utopian Dreaming, to his quoting of Christ's ""they know now what they do"" or sexual plague in ""A Plague of Fantasies"" in late capitalism.  Baudrillard's vision is presented here without nostalgia - perhaps unrecognized by the Matrix lovers (Baudrillard's visions are more appealing when taking red or blue pills, I suppose).  This is wonderful filmmaking, pure and simple.  I commend the cast (many of whom I love for their dark and equally insane projects from Archer to Arrested Development).

It could make for a more peaceful world, but a happy one? The film leads to the concept of eradicating individual thought (but doesnt delve into that sci-fi direction) as a solution. This story runs slowly and can lose your attention or depress you at times, but stick with it. The ending is a wonderful surprise that really put a smile on my face.

3875760,4,B002935GI2,"The 2010 low budget indie film `Visioneer' starring Zach Galifianakis presents the audience with a vision of a possible dark, authoritarian future. Be prepared for a powerful, clear and disturbingly accurate vision of a world without self awareness and purpose.

Synopsis: This is dark comedy at its depressing best, or at least that's how it begins and maintains through most of the movie. Yes this is truly a future world without any reason to exist. In the future scheme of things only productivity is valued, individual pursuit of excellence, friendship, love and anything else worthwhile you may think of no longer holds any meaning. We have become rats in a maze and nothing more. The loss of meaning, the understated confusion and the thinly guised desperation simple exudes from the screen. Laid out before us is a society in utter pain and that pain is exquisitely displayed on the face of the film's star, Zach Galifianakis. He is a man about to explode, literally, which is what people do when they can no longer stand living in a world with no meaning. Our hero has reached the point of critical mass and realizes that he must either break free and discover personal happiness or explode. It isn't easy in a society that has all but lost the ability to look outside the box and act independently but he must try or die.

Critique: `Visioneer' is quite a unique movie and definitely not something for anyone in search of a light hearted, unchallenging viewing experience. This film has an uncanny ability to push a lot of emotional buttons most viewers would not want to be pushed. The heavy emotional angst dealt with in the film will slowly but surely begin to be felt by the audience and trigger a personal reaction to the storyline. Not only will you begin to question whether or not you're really happy, you'll begin to examine to what extent your own personal limitations prevent you from changing things for the better. Maybe I'm giving the film way too much credit, but it certainly elicited some strong responses from me.

Despite what I've already said about the almost tangible angst emoted by the film and my strong emotional reaction to it I must also admit that 'Visioneer' has some discernible flaws; it pace is much too slow for most peoples taste and is a bit uneven at times. I was also somewhat disappointed by the ending. It much too upbeat, one of those happily ever after scenarios that just didn't fit with the overall message of the rest of the film.

It's definitely not for everyone but well worth a watch if you're so inclined.",1295568000,6,2565,4.71875

3875765,1,B002935GI2,"Visioneers is another boring propoganda film.  The easiest way to control somebody is just tell them they are capable of independent thought.  It works too well in this idiot culture and if I have to watch one more movie champion this ignorance I will puke.  Especially one that over achieves at boring me to death.  The only way to avoid manipulation is to understand manipulation.  Anyone that thinks they think for themselves because they were reinforced for thinking differently then others is a sheep.  Every human brain evolved to behave according to the contingencies of reinforcement.  This independent thought illusion plays right in the hands of this culture and causes every problem this film embodies.  We have to learn to replace aversive controls with positive controls and learn everyone is a completely unique individual and we have to adapt for each person to have them feel good.  Not everyone likes chocolate, some have eaten too much chocolate, some get tired of chocolate and some people never want to feel like they are controlled.  I certainly don't want to feel controlled and I therefore despise propoganda movies like this one and recommend we observe what works and then do what works and adapt when necessary. I recommend you avoid movies like this or laugh AT them.  You certainly can't laugh with them.  BTW Zach Galafainakis is a damn funny comic.",1265760000,2,1378,4.96943231441048
3875766,2,B002935GI2,"It's rare that a film turns me off within its first few seconds.  In fact, I don't ever remember it happening before.  In 'Visioneers', the protagonist, George Washington Winsterhammerman, a descendent of the first president, is a level three visioneer in the mammoth Jeffers Corporation.  In the opening shot, he is entering his workspace - he pauses in front of the Jeffers company logo, greets the sign, and flips it the bird.

This single action - no matter what its context - seems so sophomoric and puerile that it put the entire film into a hole out of which it was never able to climb.  That the hand gesture, in this minutes-into-the-future world, has lost its old meaning and is now a sign of camaraderie in the Jeffers workplace only makes it worse - by showcasing this ironic contrivance in the opening seconds of the film, the fraternal writer/director team of Jared and Brandon Drake reveal more about themselves than the setting of the film.  I know they are trying to be ironic - if, from my summary, it sounds witty, or clever, or edgy, then this may be a film for you.

In the soulless world of 'Visioneers', the problem is unsatisfactory life amidst luxurious plenty.  The vast conglomerate of the Jeffers Corporation is working to eradicate all unhappiness, but without an unhappy yin to hang a happy yang on, people are little more than productive automatons.  The stress builds, and they respond by exploding - literally.  George Washington Winsterhammerman is beginning to show symptoms of exploding himself, which propels him on quest to recover his humanity.

'Visioneers' is a satire of the modern corporate world, along with our consumer culture and society's tendency to avoid pain at all costs.  These are bona fide targets - but it seems to me that a successful satire should be a wake up call, an expos of bloviating pretensions and hidden mechanics at work in a society.  I thought the idea of people exploding under stress was a good premise to wrap such a satire around, but the Drakes don't dig deep enough.  The result is a parade of routine observations - that the cubicle culture can be a stifling, creativity-killing environment; that corporations don't really have our best interests at heart; that personality cults are rather shallow and unfulfilling - the list goes on, but there are no insights or eye-opening revelations here that aren't already apparent to anyone paying attention.  Even so, it could still work as straight parody, except I found little to laugh at.

Midway through the film, George's older brother, Julieen - a man who had at one time been even higher in the Jeffers Corporation's hierarchy than George had - throws away all his advantages and moves into George's pool house.  And takes up pole vaulting.  The sub-text is that the only way to keep from exploding in this world is to follow your dream.  Julieen becomes a cultish figure, and attracts a following that over time turns into a perpetual carnival - but he points out to George that even his followers don't get it.  They're doing the same as the cubicle crowd, except instead of sacrificing their dreams on the alter of commercial goods and slavish devotion to corporate America, they've laid theirs at the feet of hedonism.

Fair enough, and by far the most astute perception in the film.  Except pursuing a dream implies hard work toward personal fulfillment - three quarters through the film, it becomes increasingly clear that George's dream is to abandon his family and track down a fantasy woman he constructed out of a voice on the phone.  The idea that true love conquers all has its place, I suppose, but George's course of action is nothing more than a selfish pursuit of another thing or person to make him feel better about himself, thereby skipping painful self-examination - which is exactly what the director has spent most of the film setting up for ridicule.

Bed hopping must be one of the worst ways to avoid growth pains, and I can only assume lack of real world experience on the part of the filmmakers would make them think otherwise.  Unfortunately, in the artificial world of film, the drawbacks to this behavior are concealed behind swelling heart music and a fade-to-black before anyone has to suffer the consequences of their actions.  Of course, storytelling like this is common - it's comforting - but it seems as though the writer missed the point of his own story.  Chasing after our dreams may very well keep us from exploding, but dreaming of passion is a poor substitute for being passionate about a dream.",1261094400,6,4566,4.813060179257362

However, it got to the point where I just had to see what was going to happen.  It turned out to be a pretty good movie.  I thought the ending was fine.  Other reviewers are saying it was lame.  I didn't think so.  I thought the ending was saying true love conquers all.  Side note, love that poll vaulting neighbor.",1525219200,,444,4.214285714285714

8357362,3,B002935GI2,But the effort doesnt translate into an outstanding movie. it explores a lot of concepts but really suffers from a bit too much wandering and a lack of a solid closure. Its definitely not a Brazil and comparisons to that movie really don't do any justice to either one. Its a drama not science fiction or comedy. Its set in some alternate reality and how that effects the people that live in it and especially how one man copes with it and how it impacts his life and the relationship with his wife. If you think you're going to see something like Brazil youll be very disappointed.,1521849600,,582,4.4485981308411215

8357368,5,B002935GI2,"Someone once said that movies are no longer made to last.  That they're made for the theatrical weekend window and tossed away for the next one in their release schedule.  This movie was made to last.

The movie centers around the dull and predictable life of a character named Washington who is a descendant of George Washington, General of the American Revolution.  I won't go into the details of how the reality displayed is dare I say unusual from the way a normal life on this planet operates but I will say that it's better not knowing much going into the film.  The surprise and oddity of these points add to the comedy, especially if you don't see them coming.  The character must discover who he is, why, and where he's heading as the security of his reality is becoming more and more uncertain.

On its surface the film 'Visioneers' seems not only strange but its premise absurd yet I see that this is only present as to not become an overly serious film. It adds comedy so as to catch the viewer off guard from the true message you won't see coming.  This message is about life, living, government, privacy, marriage, fulfillment, mid-life crises', family, society, love, adultery, sex, friendship, career, history, personal identity, and individual thought.  Considering the heaviness of this message, some comedy is not only demanded but necessary.

This is a film that needs repeat viewings as to fully absorb what you're seeing in its entirety and unlike most films that proceed to preach about the evils of this or that, this movie does make you reflect not only on a serious note but a lasting one (I speak for myself of course).  This previous point made not only justifies a viewing of this film but in my opinion, a purchase and since I picked this Blu-Ray up a few years ago, I don't regret it one bit.",1482883200,,1823,4.630434782608695
8357369,4,B002935GI2,"This is a dark comedy, along the lines of a more subtle, less violent version of Brazil.

Some say this is a possible future world, where people are taught to value conformity over humanity.  For a lot of people, finding themselves listening to a room full of ""visionary business leaders"" or the equivalent on the government side, that future is now.

So a couple of ways to deal with that.  One is to make fun of it...this movie helps with that.

Casting is perfect.  Some parts do seem to drag a little bit, but I believe that adds to the effect.",1477180800,,548,4.376237623762377
