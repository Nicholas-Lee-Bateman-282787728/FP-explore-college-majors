8166279,4,B000A2T0TA,"I'm not sure why this 50-minute video is so hard to get, but there's no doubt that plenty of good work is in it.  Playwright Richard Greenberg adapted his short play of the same title as a screenplay for the PBS series AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE; since that time, Greenberg has written many notable scripts including THE VIOLET HOUR and OUR MOTHER'S BRIEF AFFAIR (running on Broadway during the writing of this review at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre: 1/20/2016 - 3/06/2016).  In 2003 he won a TONY and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his play about a gay professional baseball player, TAKE ME OUT.  http://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/8306

Much of the fun in watching this 1989 production is seeing how young (and beautiful) Keanu Reeves, Sarah Jessica Parker, and (the relatively unknown) Haviland Morris are.  Yet while the performances from both the younger and middle-aged cast are quite good, there's so much more than pretty nostalgia going on here.  The play brings up questions about family commitments, mental illness, appropriate babysitting, and friendship; yet even though the material is generally non-explicit, the larger implications (particularly regarding the character of Hank) are quite disturbing. When I was first exposed to this script, I had no idea of what the title could really mean.  I understood the stuff about late-teen rebellion from a group of aimless rich kids on summer break from college, but I hadn't really thought about many of the financial issues tying this loose package up.  Now, considering the real estate bubble of late, the idea of people living lifestyles they cannot afford and their lives and fancy houses being ""under water"" seems absolutely prophetic.

The story is set in a Hamptons beach community reminiscent of THE GREAT GATSBY; furthermore, Kip (Keanu Reeves) quotes GATSBY to Amy-Beth when he first tires to win her affections.  The sense of elitism is palpable even for the kids trying to rebel from their parents' materialism.  The younger generation seems doomed to repeat the older generation's mistakes of the heart and the wallet.  Unlike Jay Gatsby's desire to outdo the locals, Kip was born to the Hamptons and tries to act as if he weren't.  Nevertheless, wealth and the social pressures associated with it are common to both Greenberg's ""Life Under Water"" and F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel about West and East Egg.  In particular, Sarah Jessica Parker's portrayal of the alternatively strong and fragile Amy-Beth really highlights these themes about Vassar girls quietly losing their minds as they deal with would-be lovers and friends.  Also, Joanna Gleason strikes many resonate chords as a divorced mother beginning an affair for the first time in years while trying to assert a positive influence on her son, Kip.

Again, the beautiful Haviland Morris should be noted for playing the more worldly Amy-Joy, as compared to the more intellectual Amy-Beth, with such believable directness--as opposed to Amy-Beth's bundle of stressed-out contradictions.  Which of the two best friends, Amy-Beth or Amy-Joy, does Kip end up with?  Which one does he love?  For a short screenplay, ""Life Under Water"" does what AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE did so well for many years: it brings the complexity of well-written theater to an audience outside of New York and other select centers of live stage performance.  There's nothing ""perfect"" about it (except the perfectly 80s synthesizer sounds made in the soundtrack); so unless someone has a burning desire to see this piece, I wouldn't recommend purchasing the VHS for any large amount.  Nevertheless, it is a piece I'm glad to own and, occasionally, show to my theatre class as a quality piece of one-act writing and acting.

There's a rewarding script that anchors very good acting in this video production.  Maybe there is nothing to change the world in this short piece, but I wish it and the other AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE titles were more readily available to the public, at large.
