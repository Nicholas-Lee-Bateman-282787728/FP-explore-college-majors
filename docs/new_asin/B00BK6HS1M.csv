Dealing with the technical aspects of this production firstly: The camera work is involving and shows complete empathy with the young musicians involved in the project. This is clearly an HD product so far as the filming is concerned and the decision to produce the soundtrack in PCM stereo rather than attempt any form of surround sound is most likely the only practical solution to the mobile nature of the coverage. Nevertheless, it seems a shame that the final concert was not recorded with a surround sound option. Having said that, the stereo sound is very good and one scarcely notices the lack of surround sound in the final product.

The orchestra is made up of young players, mostly in their 20's and 30's, and who are otherwise professionally engaged in various European orchestras. The Spira meets about 5 times a year for a short time to study and perform a chosen focussed work. On this occasion the focus is Schumann's first symphony, the Spring symphony.

The intention of the orchestra was to share interpretive ideas with each other and thereby achieve a consensus result which would have been fully involving, and representative of, the whole group.  Initially members of the orchestra took turns to be in the limelight and to direct discussion and playing options. This was an important corrective to the players' normal musical life of being interpretively passive technicians playing according to the wishes of various conductors. Even a conductor such as Abbado, who prided himself on a co-operative approach to making music, was seen as not so involving in practice. As one player here remarked, 'Who is likely to challenge or question an interpretive point put forward by Abbado?'

However, several years further on from the initial formation of the orchestra, it is clear that the orchestra has evolved into those who naturally take more dominant roles and those who don't. There are those who are already on the way to being directors and those who are being more directed. This is admitted by one of the original members, the leader of the second violins. The leader of the orchestra is in a naturally dominant position that is unlikely to apply to the triangle player for example!

A further documentary would be worth watching in another 5-6 years to see how things develop further.

The orchestral members live together, unpaid, in a shared accommodation with male and female dormitories and very limited washing facilities shared by all. They make forays out into public places, such as shopping areas and bars, to play, by memory and standing in random fashion, classical music. This seems to be much appreciated and is certainly an effectively enjoyable way of meeting the public in a manner that would be hard to imagine established orchestras doing.

Their rehearsal methods are thorough and detailed and include singing the music before playing it at times.  Use is made of a metronome in rehearsal to establish a steady pulse and some of the resultant decisions are thrillingly challenging and frequently illuminating. There is often quite a high proportion of discussion relative to actual playing.

The final performance of the symphony delivers a reading that is noticeably fresh and vibrant. The lack of a conductor is not a problem and there is enormous enjoyment derived from this by the players which transmits well to the camera. The final coda is memorably exciting and uplifting.

This is an engrossing documentary and the subsequent concert is justification of the processes involved. The likelihood is that further development in the future will compromise the egalitarian concept of the original intentions but enough of the pioneering spirit may survive to make this an orchestral group with interesting things to do and to say.

This disc is likely to be of interest to many who are interested in how orchestras work and how they might be adapted to a changing market place. The bonus performance of the Schumann Spring symphony is worth keeping for repeat viewing on its own merits along with other performances currently available.",1393286400,2,4293,5.056577086280057
8569867,5,B00BK6HS1M,"If you're into classical music you'll hear thousand times musicians speaking about ""listening to each other"", ""making chamber music on larger scale"" and stuff like that, and I'm sure that most of the time they believe in what they say. Well... this experience raises the bar to new, unexpected heights.
The reason is that the goal here is not to present ""a product"" but just to dig deep into a score, sharing this path in all of its stages with the people who are interested in. It's music seen through the eyes of musicians. And human beings.
