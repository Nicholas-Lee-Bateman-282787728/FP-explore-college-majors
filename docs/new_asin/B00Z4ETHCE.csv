8719493,5,B00Z4ETHCE,"Look, in order for this documentary to be appreciated, one must be a student of Biblical prophecy. The events that are taking place world wide even now speak of the nearness of prophetic fulfillment. The painstaking four year study that went into the subjects presented in this documentary is a testimony to the validity of these subjects. But the greater discovery here is the overwhelming evidence of another race of beings that are intensely  interested in our human DNA. This is the true topic of discussion. What do they want with our DNA and what have they been doing with it in this present time and in ancient times as well. More importantly, who are they? My hat off, to Dr. Marzulli and his team for their dedication and professional approach in this highly controversial, but desperately needed documentary. Every Megalithic and Antediluvian culture that ever was, were established by these beings, and they are going to return. Thankfully, we know how it ends, but in the mean time, how will you prepare yourselves?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remember-the-Prisoners-He-Came-to-Set-the-Captives-Free/dp/1512743445/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remember the Prisoners: He Came to Set the Captives Free</a>",1467763200,,1260,5.774193548387097
8719494,2,B00Z4ETHCE,"Not very well produced. This is just a hodge podge collection of weird stuff on a wide variety of topics. Nothing is explained very well and no attempt is made to convince the viewer that any of it is even true. I bought this under the assumption that it featured eye witness accounts of UFO encounters, but after suffering through the first 2 DVDs in the set, I have not seen anything of the sort. I will watch the rest of it, since I paid for it, but my spouse found it so boring that he refuses to watch any more.",1456012800,2,516,4.118811881188119

8719498,5,B00Z4ETHCE,"I've watched these videos at least 2 times and can watch them again, and still learn something new. They give insight into todays strange occurances and sightings as well as looks from the past both pre and post Noah and the flood.
Very attention getting. T.L.P.",1446422400,4,262,4.717391304347826
8719499,3,B00Z4ETHCE,"I expected this would have a lot of stuff on the Nephilim, but so far it does not.  It has some good points.  But it relies a lot on religious text interpretations by religious people and not by a broader range of religious and ancient texts interpreted by scholars without the religious bent,  Since religious texts are so misinterpreted based upon which way the powers that be want to brainwash/mind control the little people at a particular time, this is just nonsense.  For one thing, the common religious texts of most of the Abrahamic religions were based on Hebrew and Aramaic languages.  Both of which contain no vowels, and because there are no vowels, they can and have been used to interpret texts ten different ways to Sunday for the purposes of those in power and mostly to sell fear porn.  In this respect Marzulli is insulting our intelligence.",1445385600,2,859,4.731543624161074
