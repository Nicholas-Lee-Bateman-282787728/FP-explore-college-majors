8251501,5,B0013JBZ1A,"This 1949 film tells the story of a relentless investigator (Ford) who works around the clock to find evidence against the mob. In relation with later mob investigation movies, The Undercover Man is fairly one-sided. The story follows Glenn Ford's character through an impossible investigation, and the closer he gets to the truth the more witnesses start dying. The mob side of the story is mostly represented by their genius lawyer, indeed we don't see the Big Fella at all. The film is in a similar vein with one of Ford's best roles - ""The Big Heat"" (1953), but The Undercover Man is much less violent and morally ambiguous. It also shares some qualities with ""The Captive City"" (1952), but the mob is less omnipresent and threatening in this film. It's view of justice and honesty are very black and white. Today's moviegoers tend to bore with this view. They want grey!

The Undercover Man will mostly appeal to viewers who enjoy Glenn Ford movies and/or movies from that period of time (40's - 50's). Also, the mob is portrayed as a faceless entity via the evidence found by Ford and his team. In some ways it's the opposite of Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"":  (a film portraying the life and times of a few mobsters). Instead of living the high life, Ford is sacrificing a ""real life"" for the sake of justice. He's separated from his wife, barely leaves the office, and can't seem to give up on the hopeless case he's tasked with solving. The real question is: Why ""Undercover Man""? He's not undercover; the mob knows who he is and exactly what he's up to. He's no ""Donnie Brasco"" here, he's not even part of the FBI. But he's a non-stop investigator known as the UNDERCOVER MAN!!!!!
