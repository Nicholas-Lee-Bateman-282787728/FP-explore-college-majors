844630,4,6304328583,"The big thing about ""The Island"" is...there is no island. It's just a ploy to lure unsuspecting clones to their deaths. The year is 2014 and a corporation has developed a method to produce human clones. The clones have been led to believe that the Earth has been contaminated, which is why they're all being quarantined indoors. Every so often the facility has a lottery drawing, and one lucky winner is offered the chance to go to ""the island,"" which is supposedly the one place on the planet that hasn't been destroyed.

One of the clones, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) finally discovers the truth when his friend Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is chosen as a lucky lottery winner...in order to protect her from being killed, he convinces her to break out of the facility and find out the truth behind their existence. A man who Lincoln befriended at the facility (Steve Buschemi) informs the clones that they are only several years old and have been implanted with the memories of their ""owners""...filthy rich people who paid a fee of $5 million apiece to have clones provided as ""insurance policies.""

Unfamiliar with their new surroundings, Lincoln and Jordan set off to find their owners and enlist their help in bringing down the cloning facility. They manage to avoid being captured killed by the facility cronies, the FBI, and the LAPD, and Lincoln finally comes face to face with his owner, Tom Lincoln (also played by Ewan McGregor). Unfortunately for Lincoln, his owner isn't thrilled about the fact that his insurance policy just wandered into his living room, and Lincoln and Jordan have to take it upon themselves to try and stop the mastermind of the cloning facility (Sean Bean) from killing more innocent ""copies.""

""The Island"" is both a great action/sci-fi movie and a very emotional story about two people who are forced to examine the purpose and validity of their own existence. McGregor and Johannson deliver superb performances and have great onscreen chemistry. I also enjoyed the chemistry that McGregor has with...himself! The scenes between Lincoln and Tom were very enjoyable. (It would have been nice to see Jordan's character encounter her owner in person, but the movie is over 2.5 hours long, so there really wasn't any room for extra footage.) The cinematography is also very impressive: in typical Michael Bay style, many of the scenes flash by in extremely fast sequences, which is unique and really sets the film apart from other action movies.

In an age where cloning is a very hot topic, ""The Island"" definitely raises some interesting questions. There are a few cheesy moments in the film (such as when Sean Bean borrows a line from Cliff Huxtable in ""The Cosby Show""...that was so lame!), and the first 40 minutes of the movie drag a bit. Things pick up quickly when Lincoln and Jordan finally manage to escape the cloning facility: from then on it's nothing but non-stop action and adventure.

Overall, ""The Island"" is a very interesting sci-fi thriller, and those are pretty hard to come by these days. Fans of McGregor and Johansson will be treated to great performances by two very fine actors, and the plot will give you plenty to talk about when you go out for drinks after the film. :)",1121990400,16,3245,4.882032667876588
844631,5,6304328583,"""The Island"" is great! Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are excellent together. Michael Bay's directing is excellent. The production team is first-rate and excellent. The screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Caspian Tredwell-Owen (who also wrote the story) is excellent. The music by Steve Jablonsky (who did the score to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and most, recently, to ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005) is excellent. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore is excellent. The film editing by Roger Barton, Paul Rubell, and Christian Wagner is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian & Lisa Fields is excellent. The production design by Nigel Phelps (who also did the production design to ""Troy"" (2004) is excellent and well worthy of an Oscar nomination. The art direction by Jon Billington, Sean Haworth, and Martin Whist is excellent and well worthy of an Oscar nomination. The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg is excellent and well worthy of an Oscar nomination. The costume design by Deborah L. Scott (who won an Oscar for her costume design for ""Titanic"" (1997) is excellent. This is one of Michael Bay's best action films since ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", and ""Pearl Harbor"".",1121990400,,1201,5.293193717277487
844632,3,6304328583,This film had better be good! becouse it looks from the prevews tobe a remake of the 1973/1975 classic LOGAN'S RUN  Only they have renamed it. everything else is the same. Youed better be good! Cuse the original is a classic!!!!!!thanks.,1121990400,,237,4.780487804878049
844633,5,6304328583,"Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson in this sci-fi action movie are clones living in a utopian society that regulates what they eat, wear, and who they should be in contact with. In the beginning of the film, McGregor's character, Lincoln Six-Echo is having dreams of being lured from his boat into the depths of the water by two men who resemble embryos. The dreams recur telling him that something isn't right. Boarding the elevator of a technodome, a woman appears on the screen announcing the lottery winner to go on an ""island"" and the winner is excited that he was chosen. Everyone on the elevator looks forward to going there because it represents freedom from their monotonous surroundings.

Lincoln sneaks over to visit a colleauge who works in the control room of the dome and sees a butterfly. The butterfly will also lead him to a lab that uses its recipients as experiments to save immortal lives.

Jordan Two-Delta played by Johannsen, is feisty and alluring to Lincoln. She is excited that she has been selected to go on the island. Discovering that the island is an illusion, he immediately warns her leading her out of the dome and into the outside world they know nothing about. They are taking an endless action adventure that will help them discover theirselves and to warn the others of this hatched plan.

Personally, I didn't think that I would enjoy this movie. But I did. It had its hilarious moments when the customers at the bar thought of them as freaks. It had its touching moments because the little boy on the screen thought Jordan resembled his sick mother. And it also touches on eugenics. Who has the right to determine when it is your time to live or die? Politicians use science to embark on these costly studies that don't have much validity ""in the name of saving lives"".",1121990400,,1810,4.703470031545741
844634,4,6304328583,"After watching most of Bay's films with a feeling that I had lost many brain cells after they were over, The Island is a step in the right direction. This film is more of a Sci-Fi/Drama than it is an all out action assault that Michael Bay is known for. The acting is good from Ewan McGregor and Steve Buscemi, while Scarlett Johansson just looks beyond lovely as she always does. The chase scene towards the middle of the film is the highlight by far. I am just glad that Bay made a film that actually provides some food for the brain rather than just a feast for the eyes.

4 out of 5 stars",1121990400,,592,4.147826086956521
844635,4,6304328583,"Placing Ewan McGregor in a sci-fi movie about clones doesn't seem like the best idea following the recent STAR WARS prequels.  However, Mr. McGregor has struck gold for the second time this Summer.  Although lengthy, this combination of LOGAN'S RUN, THE MATRIX, and MINORITY REPORT makes for an incredible blend of action, suspense, drama, and even a bit of comedy. Had those movies not preceded THE ISLAND, this film would have been flat-out fantastic. When the only negative comment I heard from an audience member is ""it felt long,"" that is a very good sign. There's something for everyone in THE ISLAND, just prepare yourself for a little graphic violence, the occassional moment that gets under your skin, and one of the best chase sequences ever put on film.  If you are looking for a movie that serves up a plot with your action, the WAR is over!",1121990400,2,853,4.75

844954,5,6304328583,"I think I may have heard about this film from someone who owned it on home video.
Can't remember but it has big stars and a big time director and for some reason,
I totally missed it.
Not to mention a 126 million dollar budget!
That was very big for 2005 film production.
I liked it!
Talk about being under-rated.
I see all the love it gets with these Amazon reviews but I had to check it out for myself.
I'm just sorry it took 12 years.
Before I go on, let me first say that this movie is a blatant rip-off of small budget film from
the 70's called Parts: The Clonus Horror.  And the similarities are so uncanny, that I'm surprised
that Dreamworks actually thought that they can get away with it.
Apparently, the people behind Clonus sued Dreamworks and was rewarded a settlement that
was undisclosed.
Now with that said, that does not change my opinion about the film.
It's still entertaining and thought provoking.
This was a Sci-Fi Action where Clonus was a Sci-Fi Horror.
I like the actors and the action. It wasn't over-bearing and I felt like the
character development had a nice balance for the pace of the film.
Good beginning, good middle, and good ending.
Just good all around.",1513555200,,1188,4.474654377880184

844962,4,6304328583,"Michael Bay has treated us with those dreadfests known as the Transformer films. He's not known to make thought provoking films but there is still something that is really charming about The Island. Ewan McGreggor named Lincoln in this flick wakes up in a sort of huge laboratory with confusing memories of a long lost life and told over and over again that he is very special and awaiting a chance to win a ticket to a mysterious place called the Island. Brainwashed to believe the world was destroyed by a nuclear war and they live underground to avoid the contamination, he never gives any thought about things that don't make any sense such as why would the aforementioned island be devoid of contamination and how come those security guards that watch his every movement are never allowed to go to that place.

He starts to grow suspicious when he locates a moth and shows it to some of his friends that ignore him. After sneaking out of his comfortable prison and seeing that the true winners of the island getaway are brutally murdered to have their organs harvested, he escapes with a female friend played by Scarlett Johansson named Jordan. They discover their compound was beneath a desolate desert and they reach Los Angeles and locate Lincoln's ""sponsor"". He discovers they are all clones of wealthy people who are sacrificed for their organs. Jordan's sponsor is a famous actress that suffered massive brain damage from a car crash and the Island committee want to harvest her organs immediately. It becomes a race against time for these two characters to find their place in this alien world before they are killed.

The movie loses some points with pointless action scenes that only slow the plot, but the character interaction is definitely there. I truely enjoyed the distinct personalities of each character and Steve Buschemi shines in his role of slimy sleazeball that helps the duo locate their respective sponsors.

While the film indeed has some flaws, it's still vastly enjoyable with a mostly positive vibe to it despite the grim premise.",1506124800,,2063,4.871794871794871

It has through out a look at various aspects of Ainu culture and tradition I have not seen any where else on television. the look at the natural aspects of Hokkaido all tie into Ainu culture and history, It really is a documentary about the Ainu, their  culture , history and traditional beliefs as well as how they and their island are adapting to the majority Japanese culture and modern times.

You open the door at the same time with all other people that looks like you and dress like you. And then you go to an orderly functioning of this huge base.
What should you call this world? Maybe heaven?
The people in this movie call it like that. It is said that the outside world has been destroyed by the nuclear war and they are the only survivor. Everybody has the same thought we are chosen. There is Xanadu place calls the island. You can see blue sky, white clouds, ocean and mountains there. The Island has become everybodys hope. They wait for one day they will be chosen to go to the island.
The opportunity is not equality. Holographic is broadcasting a guy has been chosen to go there after he has been in this base for six months. But some people who has been here for two years, three years or even longer still are not chosen yet. Some people starting to complain about it, some trying to find out if there is a regular pattern in this lottery. For Lincoln-6E, he doesnt really care about the lottery. All he want is to meet Jorden-4D during meals time.
The heaven life is simple and easy, even the food. Everything is the best combination of provisions.

I really wanted to like this.  I bought the Blu-Ray because this movie is just never on cable and I had not seen it in quite a while.  It seemed kind of like a modernized version of Logan's Run (the movie not the novel).  The domed city is really much more interesting than the typical Michael Bay explosive filled second half.

If the entire movie could have stayed inside the facility, perhaps working to escape it may have been much better.  But alas they do escape, fairly easily all things considered and then we have your typical movie with the facility and all it means just in the background.  I would actually say the worst part of the movie is, unfortunately, Ewan McGregor.  He appeared to be playing to and winking at the camera the whole time.  I am not sure if he felt that the movie was beneath his skills as an actor, but his acting and often (fault the writing) his throw away lines I guess to give comic relief, just take you out of movie.  I recognize this was never going to be a deep clone movie (think Never Let Me Go)  but it did have the potential for a lot more than how it ultimately ended.",1435190400,3,1158,4.242009132420091

 I still believe the story stands strong on it's own and promotes thought and great class discussion.  I would give this film five stars if it weren't for the gratuitous and overindulged action segments.  Overall, I love this film.

846539,5,6304328583,"Didn't see this when it was released in theaters, so I bought it recently knowing full well that this IS a Michael Bay film. And Michael Bay, as we all know, loves to give us the ride of our lives when it comes to action/adventure movies. There was a palpable dark element to the story that makes you wonder if this kind of future could actually be possible! Ewen and Scarlet compliment each other so effortlessly and Sean Bean gives another solid performance. Djimon Hounsou's character storyline ends up surprising me in the end. Nice touch! Bay knows how to give us the right mix of ingredients that make up a Summer blockbuster. To those of you who tend to be critical in your reviews of movies of this genre I have a simple suggestion, relax and enjoy yourself, really! Big Summer films are supposed to be fun. Millions of ticket buyers can't be wrong...right?",1429056000,,865,4.587096774193548

846673,4,6304328583,"Released in 2005, Michael Bays The Island is a sci-fi/action flick starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as survivors in a post-apocalyptic society in 2019. Survivors of some sort of great contamination regularly pour into the huge facility where the people are strictly monitored by the staff and winners of a lottery are promised to go to a paradisal island. McGregors character starts to suspect that all is not as it appears and tries to escape with his girlfriend (Johansson).

Bay has a bad reputation for making snazzy blockbuster dreck, like the Transformers series. While Im not a fan of those moviessimply because they don't interest me -- I AM a fan of 2001s Pearl Harbor, which is ridiculously and undeservedly panned, and  less so  1998s Armageddon. So what about The Island? It showcases state-of-the-art filmmaking with similarities to the great Terminator 2: Judgment Day, albeit not as good. The first act is very intriguing as the viewer tries to figure out the nature of the enclosed society and the second act kicks into overdrive with some outstanding action sequences. Unfortunately, the third act isn't able to keep up the dynamic momentum despite a string of intense action sequences. Still, this is definitely a worthwhile sci-fi/action movie.

The film runs 136 minutes and was shot in Nevada, California and Detroit.

846731,5,6304328583,Michael Bay at his best in my opinion. I don't think he's a bad director like everyone makes him out to be. He knows how to make a fun  popcorn action movie. The Island felt like Both Spielberg's Minority Report and A.I. Movies.  This movie had that kind of SCI-FI vibe to it which I like. Both films were great. Artificial Intelligence was better in my opinion than MR. I love the way Steven Spielberg does Sci-Fi films. And Michael Bay did great at following his tropes. I coulda say mainly the first half of the movie had a Spielberg vibe to it then it went to michael babyish in the end of the second act. Which was good the highway chase scene was awesome.,1425686400,,661,4.28

847273,2,6304328583,"Michael Bay has a talent for producing lots of explosions and stripping films of intelligence, realism and emotion - ruining a good tale with terrible dialogue. It's watchable but there are so many awkward moments that the film just becomes a tiresome bore and exercise in frustration to watch. Do not believe the ratings. They grossly overestimate the intelligence of this film.

McGregor lives in a facility along with all the others who are told that there is contamination above and that eventually they are being trained to go to ""The Island"" to enjoy life on the outside. Eventually he and others become a little curious why obvious questions aren't answered - and so will you as a viewer, finding the entire artificial existence implausible and unfortunately not so well thought through. Security is remarkably lax for such an important facility. While there he meets Johansson, another member of the white clad population. Eventually a situation arises and things change.

Bean is excellent in his role as the doctor, a seasoned actor. Hounsou is wasted and sounds like he's reading his lines off a prompter. Embarrassing. I won't say his role because it will ruin the film. Buscemi is an out of place supervisor whose role is to help fuel the curiosity of McGregor even though his entire existence and what he has to arouse curiosity is so bizarrely out of place and is illogical.

Throughout the movie you'll be groaning at being engrossed to then hearing some really dumb or awkward words come out of a character's mouth, including conspicuous product placement. Hello Heineken (among others.) I'd give this film a 2.5 solely for the visuals and having an incredible but wasted cast of actors who are the only reason this drivel is even watchable.

Disappointing because in the hands of the right director, this would have been an intelligent film. Instead it's a very long chase with a bunch of explosions, car chases, etc. and is completely forgettable. High production value, very low scale of intellect. Any comparisons to Bladerunner, Dark City, Gattaca or even the Matrix (with it's ridiculous illogical ending about ""guns"") is absurd. This is a watchable, cable rerun on a lazy Saturday afternoon too keep yourself momentarily entertained.",1408752000,,2257,5.026737967914438

847331,5,6304328583,"The good things about this film are that there is no nudity, and very little vulgar language that I can remember (but the comment ""Jesus must love you"" when talking about Jordan, was a bit annoying), and that the film depicts possible future aspects about society that would be bad. SPOILERS: Although I do not believe that Clones can live due to not being able to be given a spirit, This movie is very interesting and it kept me hoping that Jordan and Lincoln made it free.
Technology in the movie such as facial recognition, Eye scanning, fingerprint scanning, and cameras in public places are things that either are already being developed or are in the plans for future development for society. If clones were indeed possible, this movie depicts a possible horror that could result.
The ability for the mercenary agency to switch insignias at will via Velcro uniform logos, and their access to special gear, made them a force that would be difficult to escape from. This corporation even wanted this mercenary group to kill police and other people just to protect their profits. This movie depicts how far corrupt corporations might go to secure their profits.
The boat that the original Lincoln designed, is called the Renovatio, which in the movie he says it means ""rebirth"". It reminds me of the word Renovation. As it is well know that many Latin words word bored by the English language during the more than thousand years of the Latin language domination of Europe, this is not surprising. This world in this movie will certainly be at least a bit ""renovated"" now when it comes out what this corporation did with these clones.",1406419200,2,1636,4.784452296819788

847411,4,6304328583,"Outside of THE ROCK, this is probably the best film that Michael Bay has done to date. Is it a great movie? Not especially, but it's about the best you can ask for when all of the typical Michael Bay elements are mixed together with a concept and story that, while borrowing heavily from previous sci-fi films, is still somewhat intelligent and thought-provoking. The story is about a man (Ewan McGregor) who lives inside a utopian facility when, one day, he figures out that he and the other inhabitants are just being used to harvest organs. He also escapes with a woman (Scarlett Johansson) who is about to be sent to ""The Island."" The whole movie is basically set up to be a series of chase sequences, but it works because the concept is interesting enough and you care enough to want to find out what is going on, and why. For the most part, Michael Bay was on his best behavior here when it came to his sense of ""humor."" There were some stereotype characters here and there, but nothing as pervasive as what would follow in his Transformers series. By now, his visual style was well-established, but it still wasn't so chaotic that you couldn't tell what was going on in any given frame. The performances were decent, and nobody stuck out as being really bad. I thought Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson did good work as the two leads, and Sean Bean made for a nice villain. Djimon Hounsou also did a good job as a bounty hunter on the trail of the two lead characters, and who also has a nice character arc. Returning back to the visuals, there was more CGI than in past Michael Bay films, but nothing too over-the-top or excessive. There was also a fair amount of practical effects work and plenty of well-done explosions (for those are into that sort of thing). Granted, these type of movies often push the bounds of suspension of disbelief when it comes to the relationship with physical reality, but it was still entertaining on a visceral level. The score by Steve Jablonsky and Hans Zimmer was also pretty good, and accentuated the visuals and action quite nicely. However, one thing that became much more clear to me while watching this is that Michael Bay is basically an assembly-line director. There are certain elements which always be in movies that he makes. Some of them, like his chaotic camerawork and penchant for explosions are fine in moderation while others, like his voyeuristic obsession with the female form and juvenile sense of humor, would be better if left out entirely. Thankfully, there's not too much here in terms of the latter two. Also, like a lot of summer blockbusters, there's an obligatory romantic subplot. Yes, I lament that nearly all action movies have to shoehorn this element in, but I thought it was handled tastefully here, and not just there for the sake of being there. Overall, this is most fun I've had watching a Michael Bay movie, outside of THE ROCK. In fact, I'd say that those two are tied for my favorite. The story is engaging, even if derivative, and the action keeps things moving along at a good clip such that I didn't feel the 135 minute run time as much. There's something here, even for people who don't quite take to Michael Bay's style, and it's  a pretty good sci-fi/action movie to boot.",1403913600,12,3264,4.627586206896551

847597,4,6304328583,". . . and Arthur C. Clarke's ""Against the Fall of Night/City and the Stars""(they're both the same book).

I grew up with Logan's Run. I suppose for the most part, I never really minded the cheap special affects.  In fact, in high def, some of Logan's Run still looks good. Still, you just knew that someone would do a remake.  This movie isn't called ""Logan's Run"", but almost everything up to when Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta escape the enclosed city is the same. There's of course the human cloning clues, but for the most part, the movie is the same and better done.

Some other thoughts. I was hoping McCord(Steve Buscemi is great in this movie!) would be the one who put the memories in Lincoln.  I'm still not sure who.

An interesting thought, and actually they bring this up to some extent, is if everyone in the enclosed city are clones, then why are there no clones of say the police and the lead scientist Dr. Merrick(Sean Bean; I know him from a James Bond film)?  They do have the American President's clone in there though.

This is a Michael Bay film.  I'm not sure when I learned of it; but, I'm not a big fan of his transformers for sure. Michael Bay makes a great film here imo.  He does resort to Michael Bayish scenes with the highway chase and the succeeding violent scenes. Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta fall from way up top of a building and live to tell about it.

Embryonic Stem Cells, largely a desparate measure, have been considered an even lower yield than adult stem cells but there is a political motivation to continue.

The acting in the movie is okay.  I feel like the plot left few-if any - surprises.

Love DJimon Honsou, so he was an enjoyable aspect to the film.  The evil guys were sufficiently mean, the good guys were sufficiently good, and Steve Buscemi shows why he is one of the most undervalued and most reliable character actors of our time.

  Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two of my top 10 favorite actors. What a match up of beautiful people that can act.
  The premise of the story isn't far fetched as the movie is about cloning and ethics. Who has a right to decide what is human and who gets to decide who lives or dies? It may seem far fetched now but when you look at the scientific advances made thus far, I believe it could happen in the future. There are always immoral crooks ready to make profit  from the misery of other people even if it means killing them. Look at the world we live in now; people traffic girls as sex slaves, babies get sold for money, there is a black market for organs, etc.
  I know that if the technology was available today to develop full grown clones, people would have taken advantage of it.
To think this movie was made 8.5 years ago. Michael Bay is way ahead of his time.
  I came across this movie 11 days ago on cable- HBO- to be exact and I have watched it 6 times already. I will never get tired of this movie. Two thumbs up!!",1389312000,,1103,4.116822429906542

It is kind of scary how real it could be at the same time.  Basically, if you have the money and want to live as long as possible, this seems like the logical solution.  The solution of having of course a clone.  You may however change your mind if you soon discover that they aren't in the vegetative state you were initially told  Then what would you do if you found out that you were a clone? This is the basis of the movie.  Once again, great movie and there is plenty of action and the story keeps you continually entertained.

Ironically it is arguably his best work (although many will deem that faint praise).  To discuss the plot would hurt any new viewers' experience so please avoid the trailer/preview before watching this as it gives away virtually EVERYTHING.  The world has become a seemingly safe, but sterile place, however one citizen (Ewan McGregor) starts asking questions.  Intriguing, thought provoking and entertaining, precisely what a sci-fi movie should be, and the expected OTT action sequences (with the now obvious, and unnecessary, CGI 'enhancements') are limited to the final reel.  A fine effort and worthy of a much larger audience/appreciation.  I guess the disappointing domestic gross will mean Bay's next film will be Pearl Harbour 2!",1388448000,,848,5.291044776119403

848038,4,6304328583,"The Island takes 30 minutes of cheesy, less than stellar storytelling to actually get going, but once it does you'll be rewarded (or maybe disappointed depending on your view).  It's about a the characters of Ewan McGregor and the *incredibly* beautiful Scarlett Johansson being clones without realizing it initially, escaping the place they're being held, and experiencing a taste of the real world.  Steve Buscemi comes along for the ride briefly as well.  I really wish Steve Buscemi hadn't been killed off so soon.  He's one of my favorite actors.  Always has been.  He's the type of guy I feel sorry for in every movie I watch!  You want *him* to persevere danger and come out victorious sometimes!

Anyway for a while Ewan doesn't realize he's a clone, though suspicious questions come up early on that indicates something is off about Ewan (such as when he asks why he can't have bacon for breakfast- though hilarious and he comes across as childish, this scene is relevant and makes sense later on).  I'm not kidding though- the entire storyline is about Ewan and Scarlett escaping, and running and hiding together up and down city streets to avoid being brought back to the cloning facility by the generic security people (and of course the car wreck sequence is the most action-packed segment of all).  The storyline picks up when these two encounter the people they were cloned after, but Scarlett's clone was never really given any attention compared to Ewan's which is slightly disappointing.

The action scenes are made up of typical Hollywood exaggeration in terms of special effects and explosions, which is another minor flaw.  The storyline is pretty solid though, and the characters and writing are both remarkably strong.  It comes down to how much you can stomach a storyline based around cloning.  I can tolerate it occasionally and since I haven't seen such a plot in a really long time, I'll give the Island a high rating but otherwise, if this was the third or fourth cloning movie I've seen this year for example, I wouldn't be so generous with my feelings towards cloning-type stories.

Also, isn't it strange that a movie would call itself the Island when in fact the actual Island isn't even real?  Though this makes for a few really dramatic segments later on- people think going to an island is an accomplishment they've been working towards when, well... you'll see.",1384992000,,2398,4.883950617283951

848256,4,6304328583,"The Island(released July/05)stars among others, Ewan McGregor as Lincoln Six Echo/Tom Lincoln,Scarlett Johansson as Jordan Two Delta / Sarah Jordan,Djimon Hounsou as Albert Laurent,Sean Bean as
Dr. Bernard Merrick,Steve Buscemi as James McCord,Michael Clarke Duncan as Starkweather Two Delta /Jamal Starkweather,Ethan Phillips as Jones Three Echo and Brian Stepanek as Gandu Three Echo. This is a film that has a mixture of themes in it from Logan's Run and Coma to a vid game such as Fallout. The special effects are good and the action moves pretty well throughout.
The story finds McGregor working and living in small cramped quarters,with thousands of others like himself. It is a very sterile environment for all,with each having their specific work assignments,closely monitored at all times by ""big brother"".They all work toward the day when they may be taken to""the island"",which unlike the immediate outside environment(so they are told),is completely clean and livable.
McGregor has slowly been starting to question the why and wherefores of his environment and it has gotten the attention of his superiors. One day he makes an excuse to go into a maintenance area where he talks with a friend of his. While there he finds a moth which he takes back to his room. Meanwhile we are given insight into the operations of this facility. People come to the facility to invest in the companies product,which is growing non self realizing human like entities from which the buyers can harvest organs that they may need at some future date. At least this is the story they tell their clients. In reality the facility has gone the extra mile and are using the donors DNA to fully clone,bring to life and teach the clones how to function. They have created a self sustaining environment,using the clones as slave labour. The older clones help maintain and grow the up and coming ones,unbeknownst to the former.
One day McGregor re enters the maintenance facility and follows a ladder upwards. He discovers an entirely ""new"" floor he never knew existed. There he learns the truth of what has been going on. Unfortunately his presence there has alerted the authorities downstairs and he is now a fugitive. Before they can get him he gets his girl friend(Johansson)and both return to the upper floor and find an escape route to the outside world. They are smack dab in the middle of a desert area and they run as fast as they can away. They find a small bar and McGregors friend from the maintenance room. He tells them they are clones and the news doesn't sit well. They then decide to find their DNA donors,and he agrees to help. They get to L.A.,but the corporation running the cloning facility is right on their tails. They have hired a private security firm to find them and to return them before news of their existence leaks out.
McGregor manages to find his donor. After an awkward meeting the donor agrees to help him. However McGregors girl friend thinks the donor is lying and tells him to be careful. Sure enough,the donor has notified the company and a chase ensues. It all ends in a crash and the donor pointing a gun at McGregor. The security people don't know who is who,so McGregor slips his identity bracelet on his donor and they kill him. Meanwhile McGregor's girl friend has been captured and returned to the facility. McGregor takes on his owner's identity and after the company contacts him wanting another DNA sample to regenerate another clone,he too finds himself back there. However the company,realizing the danger McGregor and the extant clones possess,are planning a mass extermination of them all.
McGregor manages to sabotage a holographic terminal which keeps the facilities windows darkened to the outside surroundings. When it is gone the extant clones all rush to the surface and see the uncontaminated world outside for the first time. Fade to black.
The film has many a good high adrenaline chase scene. The part where the two are fleeing the security forces in L.A.has particularly alot of nail biting moments. The film's over 130 minute length doesn't seem like it,and that is a good thing. I am glad they kept Johansson's part down to a minimum,as her ""acting' may have spoiled an otherwise pleasant film. The film,as I said,is a mixture of different other ideas,so it doesn't earn marks for originality.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary and a featurette.
All in all a decent,fast paced film,with many chase scenes and good S/FX.Recommended.",1375488000,,4553,4.9296875

848260,4,6304328583,"Ok, this and Pearl Harbor, but that one was kind of its own thing.  While there are explosions in this movie to be sure, there is also good, quality acting, a story with some substance to it and comedic elements that were not stupid or cheesy.  The premise is that rich people can pay 5 million dollars to have themselves cloned as an insurance policy.  Think instant organ donation.  The clones are marketed as being held in stasis until needed, where in reality they are kept alive in an almost cult like community until needed.  That is as much of the story as I will give away, but the movie centers around the ethical dilemma that surrounds the program.

The acting in the movie is good all around. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor play the parts of the escaped clones very well.  McGregor also has to play the ""real"" person who interacts with his clone which he also does a great job with.  Sean Bean plays the main bad guy role as the one who runs the cloning center.  He did very well portraying the fact that his character basically had no morals and only cared about money.  I personally think the best supporting performance was from Djimon Hounsou who basically plays a bounty hunter tasked to track down the escaped clones.  He has to strike a balance between a guy doing the job he was hired for, but not truly believing in the ultimate purpose.

It does have some of the hallmarks of a Michael Bay summer blockbuster, but even if you are only lukewarm to his other movies, this one is worth giving it a chance.  It is definitely more than just things blowing up.  While it is certainly not an academy award winner or something that will keep you thinking about it for days after you watch it, there is enough substance to the story to make it worth seeing.",1372896000,,1775,4.455108359133127
848261,4,6304328583,"Michael Bay is a well-known director, but not for good reasons (mainly). He ended up ruining the Transformers name with his action-heavy trilogy, and made the laughably-bad action movies Bad Boys and Bad Boys II (sorry, Will). But, among his movies, he also has Armageddon and The Rock, which is an action classic. With The Island, starring Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean, the movie is an inspired sci-fi action movie that draws its story & action from Blade Runner, and Total Recall, but with its own original elements. The two leads (McGregor & Johansson) are clones, created for harvesting organs for the donor they're ""modeled"" after. When they realize this, they escape, and an ex-black ops soldier (Hounsou) is hired by the creator (Bean) to hunt them down and bring them back for harvesting.

The Island is a very entertaining film, being a fresh look at the action blockbuster. But, sadly, it just doesn't hit full steam, being a re-hash of two classic SF stories, and even one action scene is lifted from Blade Runner! While this is a flaw, the script is not poor but good, Bay's directing is good as well, the visuals are outstanding, Steve Jablonsky's score is compelling, and the acting is good, especially Hounsou who easily steals the show. Oh, and Michael Clarke Duncan (before the legend passed away) is great here as well.

848506,5,6304328583,"There was a movie called, ""Parts: The Clonus Horror""...later renamed, ""Clonus"". It's basically the same story...only they promise the young human ""clones"" of their future departure to a wonderful place called, ""America"". This movie is obviously not as low budget as the other film...bigger stars, more action and special effects...but pretty much the same movie...only the clones await a fabulous trip to ""The Island"" (instead of ""America"")! This one is quite well made and the acting is better.

From Wikipedia:

""The Clonus Horror, also known as Clonus, is a 1979 science fiction horror film about an isolated community in a remote desert area, where clones are bred to serve as a source of replacement organs for the wealthy and powerful. It was a Myrl Schreibman Production, executive produced by Walter Fiveson and Produced by Myrl Schreibman and Robert Fiveson, directed by Robert Fiveson, and stars Dick Sargent as the laboratory director and Peter Graves as a corrupt politician. The production cost of the movie was $257,000.

The big-budget 2005 DreamWorks production The Island, also about a colony that breeds clones to harvest organs for the elite, mirrors Clonus in a number of ways. The makers of Clonus filed suit, claiming copyright infringement. On August 25, 2006, the court presiding over this case ruled that it could proceed to trial.

According to a 2007 interview with Clonus screenwriter Bob Sullivan, DreamWorks and Clonus Associates reached a settlement, the specific terms of which are sealed.""

848507,5,6304328583,"This is one of my personal favorite films, it is so entertaining, all the people I show it to love it.  It has a lot of action in it but the plot and purpose of this movie never get lost in it, a perfect example would be and escape scene near the end of the first act.  As for the plot itself, I can't really talk about it without spoiling key things but I will say that it is a dystopic thriller with an original twist.  The acting is great, Ewan McGregor wonderfully plays a curious and cynical commoner and Scarlett Johansson does well portraying a bright but naive girl whose world gets turned upside down.  Trust me, this movie is amazing and fun to watch and there is never a dull moment to be had here.",1357776000,,709,4.153284671532846
848508,5,6304328583,that is one of the best movie so much action I like Micheal Bay movies this movie have a lot lot of action my never saw this one,1357344000,,128,3.607142857142857
848509,4,6304328583,"A remake of the film Clonus, it is also reminiscent of Logan's Run.  Clones are raised in ignorance about the real world, told that they are survivors of a holocaust.  However, they are only spare parts for the originals on the outside.  Many of the reviewers have spoken about the film as entertainment, but a project like this is also valuable for real ethical discussions.  Given the advancement of medical technologies, such nightmare scenarios may soon face us.

The cloned people are labeled as ""products.""  This is precisely the depersonalization of human beings about which popes and ethicists have warned us.  Economic systems sometimes treat people as mere material assets.  Governments may devalue the rights of persons for the needs of the state.  The child in the womb is labeled a fetus or embryo but not a baby.  Rights are limited to the time of birthing and even then only if the child is not seriously flawed.  After testing, 90% of unborn children with Downs Syndrome are terminated.

Scientists are already looking into cloning human parts in pigs and sheep.  Others suggest that primates would make good vehicles for such cloning, given current reservations about growing complete human bodies.  While it is in the area of science fiction, some are suggesting that a time may come when human memory might be transferred or copied complete into new human bodies.  Beyond the question of a soul, are we not dealing with distinct human persons?  Does money or power or convenience outweigh another's right to life and self-determination?

Earlier when Lincoln Six Echo asks about God he is told that he is the one who ignores your prayers.  But maybe this is not the case?  After a fall that should have killed the two main characters, a construction worker tells them, ""Jesus must love you!  I know Jesus must love you!""

A film like this might jump-start ethical discussions in the college classroom.  The movie has a corporation that lies both to the clones and to the outside world.  It seems to satisfy people, thinking that the clones are kept unconscious.  As Mac tells the two main characters in the story, ""Just because people want to eat the burger doesn't mean they want to meet the cow.""

It should be said that the second half of the film becomes the typical action-chase genre with car chases and plenty of explosions and shooting. I guess this suffices if deep thinking is not your cup of tea.  The one interesting spin is that a clone starts to have memory flashes from the original, as if the consciousness is somehow linked.  Not really explored, this notion could have made an entire story by itself.

The ""f"" word is used toward the end of the film.

Best dialogue in the movie...

Mr. Laurent:  ""You know my father was part of the Burkinabe Rebellion?  And when he was killed, me and my brothers were branded, so others would know we were less than human.  I've seen and done things I'm not proud of, but at some point you realize war is a business.  So when did killing become a business for you.""

Dr. Merrick:  ""Oh, it's so much more than that.  I have discovered the Holy Grail of science, Mr. Laurent.  I give life, the agnates, they're simply tools, instruments, they have no souls.  The possibilities are endless here.  In two years' time I will be able to cure children's leukemia.  How many people on earth can say that Mr. Laurent?""

Mr. Laurent:  ""I guess just you and God. That's the answer you're looking for, isn't it?""",1357344000,,3472,4.716666666666667

The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par.

848560,4,6304328583,"Fortunately I saw the movie before I read any of the reviews. Why do I feel fortunate to have done that you may ask; the reason is simple some of the key points that are progressively revealed in the movie, with great effect I might add, are revealed in the reviews thus spoiling the buildup and the surprise revelation of important truths in the story.

Since these revelations are so important to the progression of the story, I refuse to restate them here even though they have been revealed in other reviews. What I can and will say is that this is a fascinating movie that gets off to a rather slow start but then rapidly gathers speed and leaves the viewer trying to catch their collective breaths by the ending.

I was reminded of some other science fiction classics when I saw this movie, such things as Logan's Run, The Matrix, and even Blade Runner came to mind as I watched the story unfold. As I mentioned, the movie gets off to a rather slow start but this is planned to help the viewer understand the life experienced by the people in the story. Gradually additional information is provided which helps to better understand what is going on. A tension is built up which balances confusion and information until finally in the movie the reality of the situation is finally revealed.

Hints are dropped which can help the viewer anticipate what is coming and these are skillfully handled in order to maximize the impact of the final revelation. As the revelations increase in both number and clarity the action begins to pick up and the movie ends with intense action and drama. This is a movie that will linger in the viewer's memory; a movie with a powerful message.

848656,3,6304328583,"I know Michael Bay is best known for directing movies with ""the highest ratio of things blown up per 60 minutes"".  So this sci-fi thriller, set in a future where human cloning lets wealthy people regenerate themselves at the expense of sheltered, but exploited, characters with names like Lincoln 6 Echo and Jordan 2 Delta, had some real possibilities to let Mr. Bay branch out a bit.

What I liked:  The first half of the story, set in the commune-type setting where the movie's two main characters struggle against the powers-that-be to learn the true nature of their existence, and discover what the world is really like.  Ewan MacGreggor is good in the lead role, and Scarlett Johanssen is more than just a pretty face (IMHO).  Sean Bean is also excellent (in a rare, non sword-fighting role).  I liked that the movie attempted to deal with serious hypothetical issues related to limits of medical research and what wealth can/should be able to buy.  This was an excellent movie, until the clones break out of jail . . . .

What I didn't like:  Once the two main characters break out of their cloistered prison to search for answers, the movie devolves into just another bad-guys-chase-the-good-guys movie formula.  Action-packed, yes, but also utterly predictable, and a lot less interesting.

The first hour raised some expectations that this movie could be more than just standard, summer blockbuster fare.  Too bad the second hour descended so quickly into exactly that, which unfortunately we've all sat through a million times.",1336262400,3,1537,4.9609375

848659,2,6304328583,"Another sad example of an outright fantastic initial concept that's spoiled by attempts to shoehorn it into a stiff, static action movie formula. Like Paycheck and I am Legend, this works very, very well for as long as it sticks near the premise, but then bursts into a flaming wreck somewhere in the second act and cartwheels absurdly to the finish line. While the getting's good, it's the most I've enjoyed a Michael Bay movie since The Rock - its high production values make for a convincing, well-structured vision of an elegant futuristic lifestyle. Never one for nuance, Bay actually manages to imply something (an unshakable sense that something's just not right) without spelling it out in bright, bold letters for the audience. It's tough not to embrace a vision so seamless, complete and beautiful. But then the other shoe drops, and it lands with a startling thud. Suddenly we've left behind the intellectually challenging modern Logan's Run atmosphere and we're mindlessly running from a faceless gun-toting enemy, a path of fireballs and demolished automobiles in our wake. Bay takes that as a cue to fall back into his old form and trots out an endless supply of jump cuts, violent action sequences, clunky character moments and bold, excessive product placements. The picture straight-up jumps the tracks, bowls over a herd of buffalo, sails off a cliff and erupts before it can hit the ground.

848662,4,6304328583,"First off, like alot of the movies I've reviewed on here, I picked this movie up in a bargain bin for cheap. What made me purchase it was the fact that this was a Michael Bay film(you know, the guy who directed the Transformers movies, for chirssakes). Reading the back of the DVD case, I figured this movie would be kinda boring so I put it down. Then, thank Heaven, I saw Scarlett Johannson's name on the cover. It was then that I decided the movie couldn't be all THAT bad(now could it?) with her in it so I bought it.

The Island is about a private society where humans are cultivated for spare parts, surrogate parenthood, and full-body replacements for the wealthy. Yet, when two of the clones (Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johanssen) begin to question their existence and the motives of their keepers, they escape into the real world to find answers.  Sadly, though, their keepers are determined to see that they don't get away alive and that's when the real fun begins.

I was completely blown away with the movie. For a mix of Sci-fi and Action, The Island more than delivers it in spades. It goes to show why Michael Bay is one of Hollywood's most talented directors(this side of Steven Spielberg). With every movie the man makes, the films continue to get better and better and better. That's what is important, a director needs to learn and continue to grow as a director. It's easy to see that this is one of Bay's best films, besides The Transformers and Armageddon. Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johansson(who looks breathtaking in this film, I might add) deliver great performances as Lincoln 6 Echo and  Jordan 2 Delta.  The Island also stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean(a stellar cast, for sure).

Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) leads a sterile life and hope to win the lottery and go to the only pathogen free island. Unfortunately he has a propensity for snooping as all Six Echo's do. This will lead him to find an insidious secret and must escape his environment with his girlfriend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) if he wants her to live. In fast pursuit is the institution manager who has an interest in some of Jordan Two Delta's parts.

This is a great adventure as we learn about the outer world and cringes at the chase scenes.  Go ahead and kibitz, I did.  It is just possible they will not escape their fate.

""The Island"" is one of the better science fiction movies I've seen. It has obvious similarities with ""The Matrix"", ""The Village"" and ""The 6th Day"".

The year is 2019. Humanity has been forced underground, due to an environmental disaster that contaminated most of the Earth. The underground society is crowded and authoritarian, with overseers regulating every detail of the citizens' lives. A mysterious place known as The Island is the only place on the surface that hasn't been contaminated. The only way to leave the underground compounds is to win a free ticket to The Island in a special lottery.

However, the main character of the movie, Lincoln Six Echo, starts to suspect that something is terribly wrong with this futuristic society. He discovers that the outside world isn't contaminated. He also sees how two of the lottery winners, rather than being taken to The Island, are gruesomely murdered by the overseers! Bizarre cloning experiments take place in a secret part of the underground facility.

Lincoln and another inmate, Jordan Two Delta, manage to escape from the underground base. Chased by black helicopters, they pass several ghost towns, but finally make their way to Los Angeles, which turns out to be a thriving, hyper-modern city with no contamination problems whatsoever. More bizarre revelations follow, until Lincoln and Jordan decide to return to the underground facility (really a prison) to free their friends from the clutches of the overseers...

""The Island"" got pretty mixed reviews when released in the United States. I agree that the movie lacks the magic that makes ""The Matrix"", ""Blade Runner"" or even ""Star Wars"" so special. Instead, we get a combination of two or three over-worked Hollywood themes: futuristic prison break-out, chase with special effects and cool wheels, and (surprise) a bunch of clones. Still, I'd say ""The Island"" is above average. Somehow, the stereotypes seem to work, and the plot is pretty interesting.

For that reason, I give it five stars. And guys, watch out for the clones! :-)",1311465600,2,2086,5.15680473372781
848742,3,6304328583,"The Island (2005) is a big budget science fiction/action extravaganza directed by Michael Bay, that has the prodigious special effects, and breathtaking action sequences, that have become a trademark for many of Bay's recent films.  With lots of flash and glitter, and attractive leads in Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, there's plenty to dazzle the eye, but despite its positive attributes, the film seems to lack originality, realism, and a genuine heart.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.

Like most science fiction, The Island puts you in a particular reality.  The year is 2019, and the situation feels a lot like Logan's Run (1976), as a group of people dressed in uniforms, live in a controlled underground environment.  They believe that the outside world is uninhabitable, due to some kind of catastrophic disaster.  All they have to look forward to is winning a trip to `the island', supposedly a paradise.  Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) live in this reality, operated by Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), where nearly everything in their lives is governed by his rules.  Merrick Biotech is actually in the business of raising clones for wealthy clients, to provide them with `spare parts' to prolong their lives.  Clones are programmed to believe a fantasy, and have the intelligence of the average teenager, except that they are unaware of sex.

Lincoln 6 (L6) discovers that instead of going to the island, his comrades are being killed and their bodies harvested for whatever parts are required.  Some females are used as child breeders.  Jordan Two (J2) is on her way to the Island, when L6 convinces her to run away, just as Merrick's security team closes in.  The pair escapes from the underground facility, and emerge in a desert area somewhere in Arizona.

Clueless about the real world, the pair turns to McCord (Steve Buschemi) a worker at the Merrick facility who helps them to get on their way to Los Angeles, where J2's sponsor lives.  The plan is to have clone and client meet, and find a way to stop Merrick's operation.  To deal with the crisis, Merrick brings in mercenary Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) and his team to hunt down and recapture the runaways.

There are plenty of fireworks and over the top action, as the clones evade Laurent's men in Los Angeles.  Among them is a crazy freeway chase reminiscent of Bad Boys II, a fake looking jet bike ride through the crowded skies of LA, and a ridiculous escapade on the side of an office building.  It's a thrill ride, but one without any real sense of danger.  Things do get more interesting when L6 and the real Lincoln come face to face, but once again the plot takes an overdramatic ridiculous turn.  The film's conclusion features a couple of twists, but is still pretty silly and pretentious, as L6 reenters the facility.  Merrick's world comes crashing down, and the once doomed clones run free in the desert, again reminiscent of the finish to Logan's Run.

While The Island scores points for its technical achievements, the overload of special effects doesn't compensate for a story that fails to generate actual tension, and make a real emotional connection.  Part of the reason for this is because the clones don't think like real humans.  Johansson and McGregor aren't robots, but they aren't quite real either, and the story fails to connect on a basic human level.  We are supposed to feel joy that clones are set free, but why isn't entirely clear.  It doesn't help that most of the human characters are cartoonish and one dimensional.  Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou are certainly capable of much more.  Steve Buschemi as McCord, is the only major character with any real personality.

Michael Bay's commentaries are typically very articulate and informative, and that is again the case here, although he's a bit more conservative with his words.  You won't get much critical examination of the plot, but he defends product placement, and covers some interesting technical points.  High gloss science fiction with some outrageous thrills and special effects, The Island is a lightweight fantasy that is visual treat, without much of a heart.",1310860800,2,4174,4.935530085959885
848743,5,6304328583,"Wow! I wasn't expecting such a good action movie when the stars are Scarlett Johanssen and Ewan McGregor. I was dead wrong.

- Special effects are top notch. wonderful environments, rooms, lighting, etc.

848744,5,6304328583,"The story in ""The Island"" is quite intriguing. It depicts a future in which human beings, very wealthy human beings, order clones of themselves with a corporation that grows them in a vast underground city. The clones are clueless, grown into adults and then memories implanted, and they are told that a certain kind of ""contamination"" has killed everything on the planet and that aside from the underground sanctuary, there is the one last place that is still safe: the island. For reasons unknown, not everyone can go to the island and so every day there is a lottery in which someone's number is pulled to ""go to the island."" The clones don't know they are clones and they really believe this to be the reality.

The movie is about slowly deconstructing that fantasy, that almost utopian future and revealing some of the ugly truth inherent in the human condition. The humans depicted in this future are so obsessed with youth and living forever, that they have deliberately turned a blind eye to what is happening to other human beings in their society. There is a powerful scene in the movie where a pregnant woman is supposed ot go to the island, but of course that is not going to happen. She gives birth and immediately after is given an injection and killed. The business woman has her baby in arm and watches the woman die, before delivering the baby to the parents that ordered it. The new mother that holds the baby is the genetic original of the clone that was just killed. The business woman then closes the deal by offering to bring them the ""termination papers"" of their ""insurance policy"".

The storyline about how the two protagonists uncover the truth is fascinating and just the whole premise of this movie is very smart and thought provoking - because in a way it is not a very too far future from ours.

However, while this movie started strongly, it ended on a rather slow note. Of course not literally  - which is precisely what the problem with this movie is. I feel as if there is almost a clear division in this movie and that it can be divided into two parts. The first part entices us quite intelligently into this fascinating future and there is a lot of potential that is set up here. But the second part, which goes into overdrive, ends up being a lot of bang bang, super action, one long car chase scene with crashes and explosions. There is a pause and then the quality of the film emerges again. But as soon as the car chase scenes a la Michael Bay begin, everything goes downhill. I really wish they had continued on that strong beginning instead of allowing it to fizzle into mediocrity. The ending was pretty good though and connected the beginning with it.

Despite the one short coming I think this movie is quite underrated in the message it attempts to convey and the quality with respect to *how* it was done. The actors truly inhabit the roles they are portraying, and so they are believable. The chemistry between McGreggor and Johansson is great and I thought the cinematography and soundtrack were amazing, truly conveying the mood of the movie about a future not too far from ours.",1305158400,4,3129,4.600358422939068
848745,5,6304328583,"I LOVE this movie! The semi-futuristic story about producing human clones for organ harvesting is crazy! This movie melds future technology with modern day settings well, so that it doesn't come across too ""I, Robot"", or something. It is fairly believable. Scarlett Johansson looks AMAZING in this movie, and she and  Ewan McGregor have pretty good chemistry. This action movie is probably more of a chick flick, although you could probably watch it together with your boyfriend without too many groans. This movie has a very almost chill out lounge-y effect to it at some points. Although it may be missing some elements in character development and dialogue, I don't think it is as bad as some people say. I can watch this movie over and over!

This realization comes about incrementally.  While inside the clone world, the viewer has to take its odd, incongruent limitations on face value.  The accidental infiltration of a moth or butterfly from the supposedly contaminated outside world, leads McGregor to start questioning his boundaries.  The clandestine and illegal machinations of a huge corporation is certainly nothing new, but the efforts to retrieve their escapees in an otherwise slightly futuristic but normal world are enormous.  I estimate that that McGregor and Johansson are on the run for at least half the film, if not more.  The film is basically an action romp with the requisite moral undertones for a typical sci fi adventure.  I think the movie accomplishes its limited purpose, and, as such, sc fi fans or action/adventure fans will find this film at least worth a rental.  As if provided as a bonus, several scenes with McGregor and Johansson in the outside world, with no idea how it operates, gives the viewer some very welcome chuckles.",1298851200,2,1163,5.181818181818182
848803,5,6304328583,Great Movie excellent quality beautiful cinematography.  Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen make an excellent cast.  Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean were also great.,1292630400,,163,6.043478260869565

Lewis once said, ""I agree technology per se is neutral, but a race devoted to the increase of its own power by technology with a complete indifference to ethics does seem to me a cancer in the universe."" This movie takes a scary look at technology and science without the guidance of ethics.

In this futuristic world, the wealthy can create clones of themselves so they always have a ready supply of replacement body organs if needed. Sound good? Well, the clones are kept in a decontamination facility where they are told they must live because the rest of the world is contaminated. The only other safe place left on earth is an idyllic island. Periodically, the keepers of the clones hold a lottery in which the winners are told they get to go live on the island; in actuality, they go to have their body parts harvested.

As in The Matrix, the true nature of the plot is not revealed until about halfway through the movie and, when viewers finally figure out what's going on, it's mind blowing.

In an age in which embryonic stem cell research and cloning undermine the value of human life, this movie's message could not be timelier.",1291075200,2,1144,4.598039215686274

If it wasn't a remake, it at least has some strong similarities.  Now that I think of it, I see that there are significant differences, but if you've seen COMA and THE ISLAND you'll see what I mean.

Well, I finally had a chance to take a look at this film, and I was, frankly, quite impressed.  Scarlett Johansson, Ewan MacGregor, and Sean Bean headline the cast.  Let's see...who will we make the protagonist and who will we make the antagonist in the main plot?  I wonder, I wonder...

Anyway, McGregor and Johansson live in a highly controlled, closed environment habitat to protect them and many others from a dreadful plague that has affected the world sometime in the future.  Yep, this is a futuristic Sci-Fi flick...and I tend to like these.  So, their lives are safe, but bland, and there is a strong component of ""Big Brother is watching"" to their existence.  People wait, work, and watch to see who will win the ocassional lottery to go to ""The Island"", a paradisiacal place where people live in complete luxury.

MacGregor starts to wonder about their existence and starts asking questions.  Then, one day he finds a large moth that somehow made its way in from the outside, and this starts him wondering whether there really is a plague out there.

If you like unexpected plot twists, plenty of action, a sci-fi slant, and. you know, car chase scenes, gunfire, and guys dressed in black chasing the heroes, you'll like this film.

It's good, but probably won't be a classic, though I'd be happy to watch it again sometime.

That was, until I bought this, completely on a whim, while browsing at the local MTC. This movie has single-handedly restored my faith in Michael Bay and his story-telling ability.

It is also rare for me to hear such a film score that would draw me, irrespective of the film itself. The soundtrack is amazing right off from the DVD menu and is easily 50% of the experience.

The residents lead a simple regimented life like overgrown school children; their health, diets, and activities are closely monitored, and they are discouraged from asking questions.

Lincoln Six-Echo develops an unhealthy curiosity in the outside.  On a fateful excursion through a service tunnel, he discovers the residents are ""product"", living tissue banks paid for by wealthy clients of a bio-tech corporation.

848903,1,6304328583,"Where to start? The storyline is unoriginal, the dialogue is feeble, the direction is pathetic, the consistency of plot and dramatic detail absent, the acting neglible.

The film centers on clones 'manufactured' in order to provide body parts to compensate for malfunctioning real humans. It is a silly sensationalist plot. It is something comparable to '1984' or 'Brave New World' but without the originality or intelligence. The finding of bodies in vats inspires no emotion - we have seen this all before, e.g. in the Matrix, big deal!

The unfolding of the plot mainly involves implausible explosions and random killings. One character, who helps the two leads, is shot in broad daylight by supposedly covert clone assassins who are instructed not to draw attention to what is actually going on regarding the company and its illegal cloning techniques. So, I don't understand - a guy that could give them information about the clones and is not resisting they just randomly shoot so as to draw as much attention as possible to what they are doing?

More explosions ensue...more killings of innocent people...more random dialogue...eventually the assassin shoots the 'sponsor' (cloned person) rather than the clone when really he doesn't have to kill anyone - why not shoot him in the leg if you are going to shoot - why go for the heart?

Towards the end we have an Agent Smith vs Neo scene in which McGregor's character responds to being called by his clone name by the evil head honcho by saying ""My name is Tom Lincoln"". It puzzles me why he should do this since Lincoln (the sponsor) tried to have him killed only moments earlier, why would this be so emotionally relevant?

The acting is appalling - McGregor and Johansson are characteristically bad but Bay makes it impossible for them to be fair. One might understand Megan Fox's recent disgust at Bay's directing based on this film although there is no way I would waste more of my life watching his rubbish. Really this film is unbelieveably poor, I mean it truly defies belief how shabby a film it is.",1255305600,7,2065,4.838526912181303
848904,1,6304328583,"Oh dear, yet another awful Michael Bay movie. Like all of his films 'The Island' is both very Big and very, very Dumb.

The Big: Well this film is massive in terms of its superficial flashy design. It looks a billion dollars and pretty much every moment is superbly well realised. Only the Americans can do this kind of total, balls out blindingly impressive stuff. And it's a long film too. You get a colossal amount of bangs for your bucks as vehicles explode in sheets of flame and tearing metal, buildings collapse and shatter into constellations of twisted sparkling shards of glass and heroes weave crazily in and out of the heaving maelstrom. Get the picture? It's just so overdone. Camera moves slide and out and veer as in a lunatic's dream. Even the quiet moments are beautifully designed but the whole monstrosity bears the brutally stamped imprint of US megalomania.

Which is fine if you're drunk and just want a seemingly endless burst of strobing violence interspersed with utterly weak and forgettable interludes.

Which brings us on to The Dumb: And how truly dumb this film really is. The script is so bad it seems written by a toddler. The plot (if you can call it that) revolves around the farming of cloned humans for their organs. And that's it. Nothing else. There are no revelatory leaps of vision. Not even a second act. Just chuck your stars into the mess and make them run, run, run. This might be a laugh if it was ironic or self-aware but this film has absolutely no brains. They even steal a moment from an old Star Trek movie and use it as a set piece. The direction is also similarly tragic. It stumbles about and falls on its backside so often that this film looks like a bunch of TV commercials badly stuck together.

And what of the actors? Well I'm happy they got the work and were paid very well but I was a little disappointed to see the marvellous Sean Bean (cast as The Nasty English Villain) die horribly yet again. Scarlett Johannson gets to look gorgeous (but is mostly made to scream a lot) and Ewan McGregor gets to show off his total inability to master foreign accents.

This is a heinous waste of time and money and I shudder to think how many millions of tons of carbon dioxide it's production pointlessly shoved into the atmosphere. I imagine Michael Bay as some kind of hideous blob on a yacht somewhere with his ignorant friends getting off on how rich and talented they are.

Love him or hate him, you generally know what you're getting into with a Michael Bay movie: lots of action, quite a few cliched one-liners, and at least one or two plot holes so big you could drop a cow through them. And I don't mean that in a bad way - fun, mindless action is a valid and amusing way to spend a weekend evening. ""The Island"" is a step above many Michael Bay movies, though, in possessing a very thought-provoking philosophy underneath all the explosions and whizzing bullets.

Not that the plot holes don't impinge heavily, of course. The clones being grown for extra parts are kept placid and calm with hypnotic suggestions that they want to go to the island, that they live to go to the island, that they don't need to think or question their surroundings. While the issue of ""Why don't you just grow them in a vat?"" is touched upon and discarded (the organs need stimulus in order to thrive), one wonders perhaps why they don't just give up this whole island scheme and just hypnotize the clones to want to serve as useful and happy organ donors. I can hear the objection of human survival instincts, but there have been plenty of death cults in the history of humanity and it seems like it wouldn't be too tricky to engineer one in this situation. Then you would have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Restaurant-at-the-End-of-the-Universe/dp/0345418921/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a>&nbsp;situation where you can cut right through the issue of ""is it moral to eat meat?"" by having a cow that actually *wants* to be eaten, and is capable of saying so to the expensive clients.

But I digress, and really ""The Island"" is better as a metaphor for the current debate as to whether poor people should be allowed to sell their own organs in order to support their families. In this metaphor, ""going to the island"" would mean giving up your life to provide a better one for your family, and in this case the whole ""but they are human, too!"" rejoinder cuts just as harshly (if not more so) as with vat-grown clones.

Realistically, though, any philosophy in ""The Island"" takes a firm back seat to the action. Male characters like fast things that go ""vroom!"" loudly, simply because they are male, and female characters are sweet and pretty and emotionally sensitive because that kind of stuff is handed out with the second X chromosome. But in true Michael Bay form, the excessive action is lavishly expensive action, and the special effects are spaced out with extremely good acting on the part of all the major actors. In light of all this, it's hard to get too nitpicky about the plot holes like the fact that memories are encoded into DNA and ancillary bad guys don't usually have major changes of heart at the last moment. View ""The Island"" for what it is - a pretty, if somewhat vacuous, destination that is worth a nice visit, even if you wouldn't want to live there.

I ordered a copy from the Amazon U.K. site based on the positive comments of another reviewer--and YES--this is truly a ""region free"" Blu-ray Disc.  It WILL play on your standard Blu-ray player sold in the United States (which was primarly designed to play 'Region A' discs). I put the disc in my Sony player--and, there was no problem whatsoever--the video and audio are excellent--well worth the price.  I paid about twenty dollars, including shipping--a much better price than listed in the U.S. site.

Perhaps ""The Island"" will eventually be released in the U.S. on Blu-ray (why it hasn't yet been released in the U.S. makes no sense--who makes these decisions?), but for now, ordering directly from Amazon.uk.com is an excellent alternative.

By the way, the excellent 1966 (true story/adventure/historical drama) movie ""Zulu"" is another ""region free"" Blu ray Disc that looks absolutely stunning in Blu ray--it is one of the best in my collection--as good as the new movies.

848981,4,6304328583,"Scientists creating ""clones"" are the villains in this movie. The clones' purpose is to provide their human counterparts replacements for defective body parts. (Boy, I could use a few!)

The only problem is that one of the clones (Ewan McGregor) starts to become human with feelings and emotions all his own. He is then joined by a female clone (Scarlett Johansson) and the two them try to escape their surroundings - a prison-like laboratory in the middle of the desert.

The last half of the film is them on the run, trying to tell someone the truth.

This turned out to be an Arnold Schwarzenegger-type action movie, which isn't all bad because Arnold's films were at least entertaining. It features the same stuff: outrageous scenes in which incredible things happen to the heroes....like assassins shooting at them from 30 feet away and never hitting them or falling from tall buildings....and never getting hurt! These two leads have nothing on Superman!  They are indestructible, apparently. It's lunacy....but it certainly has it's fun moments with some tremendous stunt work.

To me, the best aspect of this film was the stylish camera-work. There are some really, really nice visuals in this presentation, and good sound.

848985,4,6304328583,"It may seem a stretch to give four stars to ""The Island,"" a science fiction action adventure piece long on action and carrying a conventional sci fi theme--human cloning.  The story line is admittedly not surprising:  human clones are raised like livestock in an isolated, tightly controlled secret community to either prolong the lives of their original human counterparts through the harvesting of their organs or by producing babies for infertile women.  The clones have been told by their ""normal"" human managers that they are the only survivors of a catastrophic contamination of the rest of the earth and that they are gradually being settled back out as space permits on a beautiful tropical island.  In reality, those who are selected for the trip to the Island are scheduled for organ harvest or baby delivery, after which they will be killed.

But despite the relative lack of originality and the obvious play to chases, crashes, fast vehicles and breathless escapes, this film made a great impression on me due to the relevance of its premise and the thought-provoking environment it created.  While Hollywood is usually morally tone deaf if not downright morally insane, science fiction films and television are often surprisingly profound and insightful, even prophetic.  ""The Island"" is no exception.  Its depiction of a future American society in which the lust for extending life results in the debasing of life is very pertinent to contemporary debates about science and ethics.  Traditional reverence for all forms of human life is on the defensive and a shallow pragmatism that increasingly allows for any measures to be taken, so long as the end cause is worthy, seems to be winning the day.  Using human embryos for scientific experimentation and ultimately products is a big step in the direction towards the horror depicted in ""The Island.""

I was particularly fascinated by how the film depicted the interaction between humans and the human clones.  The underground human cloning factory/facility/prison is staffed by large numbers of humans, working as technicians, doctors. nurses, security personnel, computer programmers, switchboard operators, administrators, food service workers, etc.  The jobs run from low skills to the elite of science and engineering, and include men and women of various races and ages.  Despite the large number of these employees, they all are fully aware of the fate of the clones that they care for and control.  This is not a premise based on a small cadre of devilish conspirators who are in the know, while the rest of the community are deceived.  As different and as numerous as they all are, they have all bought into the lie that these clones are subhuman and morally worthy of no more consideration than livestock.  The facility is in fact similar to a livestock operation in the manner in which the humans view the clones.  Yet at the same time, the many different features of the place--the work duties, the entertainment, the security measures to prevent romance,  the elaborate deception practiced on the clones to insure their tranquil behavior--all scream out that the clones are fellow human beings, not cattle or chickens.  While the film's setting is fantastic, it is a chilling reminder of how easy it is for people to view another type of person as subhuman.  Once one classifies someone else as subhuman, one can rationalize any horrendous treatment of that person.

The only absolute protection against the debasing of humanity is a foundational belief in the sanctity of human life.  If humanity was created by God with his special stamp of approval there can be no argument for using people as objects.  That this must also include the earliest forms of human life and the means of procreation is demonstrated by the film ""The Island.""  If we do not hold every aspect of human biology that is fully human or in the process of becoming human sacred, we will end up using these forms for food, medications, body parts, and God only knows what else.  If a society denies the sanctity of human life, lust for life, fear of death, greed, ambition, and apocalyptic political and scientific theories will motivate mankind to turn upon itself.  Because ""The Island"" brings this subject into focus, I highly recommend it.  Four stars instead of five only because the action/adventure element was a bit overdone for me.",1238803200,2,4388,5.04016620498615

848987,3,6304328583,"The Island is not a terrible movie as some claim. Nor is it a great one. It is an average quality action bonanza masquerading as a science fiction film. I say masquerading because while the plot line fits neatly into science fiction cliches, the movie is at its best when glorying in exploding Mack trucks, hover bikes, gun fights, and car chases. The science fiction story is merely a mechanism to deliver heavy doses of wanton destruction. There is nothing wrong with action for action's sake, as long as you can set aside your disbelief. This is a 'turn off brain, watch stuff blow up' kind of movie. Watched with those expectations, it is seriously entertaining and well worth renting.

That said, the movie has many flaws:

The plot line is so full of holes that I'll not bother pointing them all out, but a few are remarkably glaring such as continuity errors in droves. One is when we learn that all ""Echo"" products are 3 years old, despite the fact that earlier in the film one Echo model indicates he has been waiting to go to The Island for 7 years! Which is it? Other elements strain credulity like the necessity of shutting off a holographic device whose purpose is never explained, and even when shut off, contributes nothing to the film's storyline.

The science fiction elements are rehash from other movies, and the few poignant questions the film raises, such as the morality of producing clones to harvest their organs or the viability of trusting private corporations to behave ethically without any mechanisms in place to assure that they do, fall far short of their promise. The Island is more interested in entertaining with explosions and unbelievable stunts than offering serious answers.

By far the most IRRITATING thing about the entire movie was the far too frequent product placements, many of which seriously date the movie. I mean come on, and information terminal with MSN logo 50 years in the future? Cars that are remarkably similar to present day, including a 09 Cadillac? A dorky looking Chevy truck driven by Buscemi's character? Budweiser beer bottles blatantly set center screen for nearly a second... The list goes on and on. All of these adds are more easily spotted for the silliness that they are years after the film's original release. They smack of greed, and undermine the film in a huge way.

The technology presented is so all-over-the-place, sometimes exactly the same as present day (the automobiles) and others seemingly very advanced such as nano-bot neuro scanners that enter one's eyes (and a blatant rip off of Minority Report). The depiction of a future LA is about as mundane as it could be. Why film makers think the future should be depicted by hovering mono rails or air born traffic is beyond me. There is nothing futuristic about the film; it relies only on cliches from older and superior films.

The acting is wooden and the characterization is nonexistent. It is very hard to sympathize with anyone in the film, as the main characters are cutouts made even more two dimensional by the fact they have no real histories, and have by the film's own admission ""the education of 15 year olds."" There is very little fertile soil here to grow anything interesting. The characters are beautiful (especially Scarlett) but that's about it.

Overall this is a movie that succeeds as an action blowout but not as a thinking man's movie. Bay is an action film maker, and this is another in his long succession of spectacles big on CGI and small on story and character. A movie like Blade Runner made you CARE about the characters, even the Replicants that Deckard was out to destroy. Bay struggles to make the audience care about anything more than the outcome of one more protracted chase scene. The Island can dazzle with effects and explosions, but it cannot move the viewer's heart.

849030,4,6304328583,"Cloning is the heart of this thriller, which derives its label from--as all thrillers do--exaggerated tensions between opposing forces on screen. In this case it's two of the clones realizing their real natures and going up against the powers that be to ultimately defeat them.

The reason this works so well is because of the solid plotting that pits the two self-aware clones (Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen) vs. the bad guys who created the clones in the first place and have them there to insure body replacement parts, among other things, are always available. One thing leads to another and before you can say ""abracadabra"" or some such, we've got ourselves a fused movie of human elements and techno-demolition that is more characteristic of current thrillers.

But that's OK. Innocents always get chased by bad guys in a thriller and there's always weapons and like that. Eventually the title turns out to be an actual haven, which for at least half--if not more--of the movie was not the case.

This is worth watching for a number of reasons, not least of which is Steve Buscemi as an old-time maverick techno-geek who proffers sage advice to the clones on the run. It's definitely interesting to see the juxtaposition of the old techno and the new.

Nuff said. Good movie.",1233014400,,1288,4.867579908675799
849031,4,6304328583,"THE ISLAND

I don't know but I kinda like Michael Bay, at least the man knows how to deliver on the action even though he is not known for great story telling. But I think he is a pretty good director and he hires Steve Buscemi [probably my favorite actor] a lot so at least he can recognize talented actors. But regardless of the over all assumption that he can't really tell a story I would say to those people to check out this flick right here, it may not be your favorite movie but it may turn out to be your favorite Bay film. There is a quote on the back of the case that states ""great story, great action, great film"" and I could not agree more.

Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson star as two people who live their day to day lives as told by the government, eating when told, working when told, sleeping and waking when told basically everything when told. Still they are fine and awaiting their turn to be chosen to go to the last place on Earth not affected by a plague that wiped out humanity almost, The Island. But Ewan's character is suspicious about what is really going on and his suspicions are only heightened by Steve Buscemi who some how has all these things that he should not have. It turns out that they along with every one else down there are clones inside an underground bunker, they are clones of rich people who want fresh matching organs when they need them. So they make an escape that sends the owner and employees into a panic because this thing is far from legal. So as they make their way through a world they do not know on the surface and come to terms with what they are and that there is no island they are being hunted by the best money can buy. They are out to find the people they are cloned from and try to convince them they are just as alive as them.

Producer/director Michael Bay really did a great job with this film and deserves to be recognized for doing so, I think for a director who was only known for action really did a good job with a story as well. The fact is that the first half of this movie and that includes the escape from the underground prison is very un Bay like, he gives the characters time to develop and lets them interact on a level he had yet to do. Still credit needs to go to the writers as well; Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci wrote a great story that while not the greatest thing ever is still very entertaining. Mauro Fiore did a great job shooting this movie and made it look like an epic.

Ewan McGregor was great in the lead role and played it with a kind childish charm in the way that everything was new and exciting to him, he really felt he was learning. Of course he was going crazy and scarred as well and that shows just as much. Scarlett Johansson was excellent as his partner in crime so to speak but of course that is expected, she is always one of the show stealers no matter what film it is. Djimon Hounsou is great as the lead hunter going after these two who has a change of heart, and Sean Bean is brilliant as well. But it is of course Steve Buscemi who steals the show in my opinion as the only friend that these two have on the outside since it is him that got Ewan thinking. He is the reason I went to see this and also the reason I wanted to buy it when it came out but luckily the entire movie going experience was great.

Of course this film does have a flaw but it is not a big one at all, in fact it still was enjoyable. The last half of the film seems to lean a little too much on the action and kinda forgets the story a little bit, so I guess Bay falls a little on what he knows but that is not a bad thing. So with that said this is actually a really good movie that most people should enjoy, I know I did.

Lincoln becomes particularly alarmed when his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johanssen)wins the lottery and escapes with her into modern day Los Angeles.

Adding to the intrigue of this movie is the fact that the clones have been programmed not to feel love or sexual emotions beyond friendship, so throughout the movie, there's this cloud of profound chemistry over our two main characters who are being chased by the police and a higly trained and motovated team dedicated to destoying Lincoln and Jordan. Can they escape...only time will tell.",1206057600,3,1581,4.8088235294117645
849114,5,6304328583,"Visually beautiful with attractive and believable stars who work well together, this sci-fi action movie blends intelligent concepts with a briskly moving plot to offer viewers a breathtaking view into the not so far off future, now.  Ewan McGregor was excellent as the childlike and curious Lincoln, and also is a convincing supercilious jerk as his owner, in a dual role.  Scarlett Johansson is perfect as the nymph-woman, a role which would take quite a bit of depth to carry off as well as she does, a subtle and understated performance, with her innocence being crucial to the mercenary, played by Djimon Hounsou, in realizing his essential truth.  The mind blowing special effects scenes with the train wheels and the falling sign are seamlessly integrated into real life action, like, how did they do that without someone getting creamed?  Steve Buscemi adds both a lightheartedness and a dark comedy of horrors feel that the movie needed in order to make the transition from the ultra-hygienic, synthetic world to the real, gritty one, believable.  With elements from Coma, The Sixth Day, The Matrix, and even Dave, but not derivative or copying.",1202601600,,1154,5.052631578947368
849115,5,6304328583,"For some reason Michael Bay gets panned by everyone yet his movies are always blockbusters. Personally I think he makes excellent movies and his visuals are spectacular. Its not the explosions or the excessive actions its all about the colors, angles, moods and emotions he manages to capture on film. His films are art, he is an artist, they are visually beautiful. I know a bunch of avant garde loving film geeks will despise me for saying this but honestly I would MUCH rather watch Michael Bay films over hyper inflated, avant garde schlock like Tarkovsky.

Good movies and good art need to be accesible to ALL. Michael Bay manages to achieve films that appeal to all audiences.

This is a fun movie and one that is a great contemporary telling of Plato's cave allegory. Interesting, well executed and visually stunning.

Hate me if you will but I think Michael Bay is an excellent film director.",1201305600,,900,4.756410256410256

Although the movie is a 'bit' disturbing at times, overall it has a strong story line, excellent visual effects and lots of technology thrown in. There's a very cool flying bike contraption and a levitating Amtrak train.

A point to note is that all throughout this movie you can see very recognizable logos of well known companies. Perhaps this movie is also an experiment in 'in-movie' advertising. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson make a good team here and overall add to the likability of an already quite capable movie.

I think this movie would have done a lot better on DVD than in theaters. A scifi fan cannot go wrong with this one.",1198713600,,783,4.75
849117,4,6304328583,"This is a good film by Michael Bay that obviously has some story to it dealing with some important ethical and morailty issues on cloaning.  This is not the first time a movie has been made on such issues, though its an improvement over such films such as The 6th Day.  With a great cast, excellent use of cgi action in a futuristic setting, and a fine plot - one would think it is an overall success.  It is enjoybale in the end, but the three main elements seem to clash along the lines too often to keep it from perfection.

The movie begins with the enclosed lifestyles of the clones, though we don't know that they are clones quite yet.  It brings up many questions as to what exactly is going on, and though a bit slow at times, it doesn't really matter cause it makes you want to keep watching to figure all this out.  Once we discover the meaning of what is exactly going on, the thrills of the chase and action begins, and that's where it gets exciting yet the story gets a bit crumbled down.  Then comes the question of if this is exactly right, what people are doing to these clones, and it comes to the point that even bad guys will do good when the line is pushed too far in their field of work (you'll know what I mean when you see the Djimon Hounsou character).

If the moral/ethical point of view is tiresome or doesn't interest you, there is still plenty of sci-fi thrill to entertain, as well as plenty of humor thrown into the mix.  Again, the cast list is impressive, and even the smaller roles seem to play an interesting part in this film.

Overall, this is a fine movie that is good but not great.  Things don't flow too smoothly altogether, but this is still a movie sure to entertain and make a great comment about ethics and morality about longlivety.

849204,5,6304328583,"Michael Bay's action packed sci-fi vehicle is sure worth every penny. Even though there are some similarities between this and the 6th day and many other science fiction movies of the past it still manages to bring in something new to the genre. The movie begins in a facility where supposedly the last humans are living, of course this is a lie, and they are in fact clones of rich industrialist who want either to live longer or need a new organ to live on. The interesting thing is that the clones don't know they are clones, and the real copies don't know there are clones of them living in a military bunker. without giving any more details this movie is worth buying, the action is very reminiscent to other Michael Bay's movies (Bad Boys II, Transformers) in my opinion this is probably bay's 2nd best movie (the first being transformers) if you liked the 6th day or enjoy high adrenaline action sequences with an interesting and intelligent plot then this movie is for you

849206,4,6304328583,"Lincoln Six-Echo leads a very organized life.  His sleep is monitored.  His urine is checked so his diet can be adjusted.  Even his clothing is put up in his cabinet in an orderly utilitarian fashion.

So, why does Six-Echo want to win the lottery and go to the island?  He's been told all his life that this is the place where the human race will continue and survive.

And that's not quite a lie.  Lincoln Six-Echo and the others like him are living to continue the human race.  They're 'property' (aka clones), bought and paid for by the richest and wealthiest as an insurance policy against damage to their own persons.

Initially, clients buying into the insurance were told that their clones would be kept in a persistent vegetative state; however, by the E generation, the scientists realized they needed to give the donors memory and awareness.

And that's where the problem comes in.  Lincoln Six-Echo is dreaming of boats, learning Latin phrases when his lessons are deliberately kept at only a barely functional level.  He's gaining awareness--and memory that's not his.

When Lincoln Six-Echo stumbles across the truth, he stops his best friend Jordan Two-Delta from going to the island and they both escape into the real world.  Their challenge is to find their sponsors and convince them to help them.

But, the corporation that developed them will do anything to keep their business and keep the secret of the clones quiet.  That includes hiring a crack team of Ex-Special Forces agents to hunt down and kill the escapees.

Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) leads the squad. He puts the two ill-prepared clones through their paces.

""The Island"" is fast-paced and very well done.  Imagery is beautifully filmed.  I honestly wish I had not missed this film on the big screen.  One of the best futuristic chase scenes, including cars, trucks, and helos is here.

I was especially impressed with Ewan McGregor's performance as both Lincoln Six-Echo and Tom Lincoln. Very subtle moves convey the differences between the original and the copy.

Overall, ""The Island"" is well worth the time to watch.  My half-star deduction is for a somewhat slow start.",1193356800,,2161,4.922437673130194
849207,3,6304328583,"The old saying goes, ""Nowadays even the future ain't what it used to be.""  Indeed, as imagined by director Michael Bay in The Island, it's downright ghoulish.  Fans of sci-fi thrillers will notice many influences - The Matrix and Bladerunner are just two.  It has their visual style, brilliant art direction, and dazzling special effects.  Where it differs is the level of commitment to concept.  In Matrix and Bladerunner you have interesting philosophical puzzles examined with precision, in the Island an interesting moral puzzle is introduced and then dropped the way a child with ADD might drop a video game to spend a little while grinding marbles in the garbage disposal.

If you've ever wondered about the ethical consequences of using stem cells, and speculated about the inevitable impact of this practice on society, this movie was supposed to be for you, but isn't.  For that matter, if you've ever thought about the difference between ""important people"" and ""disposable people"" - i.e., rich Americans vs. third world teenage kids working in slave labor conditions, meticulously crafting day-glow costumes for ""Hip-Hop Barbie"" - this movie could have been for you had it been written and directed by someone else.  As it stands, if you like snazzy visuals, bodacious chase scenes, and plot holes large enough for an armored car flipping end over end to pass through, sloppily wrapped in a pseudo-futuristic snack pack, this movie IS for you.

All films are written in 3 acts; usually viewers don't notice the transitions.  Here it looks like the three acts were shot on different sets in different countries, written by different people, and directed by different people.  Act 1 is classic high sci-fi, visually convincing and intriguing.  Something is rotten in Denmark, we don't know what it is but it's cool, and we want to find out.  Act 2 is a chase scene on steroids.  Oddly, in the future some things are very different while some things haven't changed at all.  (Sadly, the Cadillac logo is the same, puzzling, since it looked old fashioned 50 years ago.)  In Act 3 many things blow up, the film even attempts a brief reconciliation with its basic premise.  Bay's chutzpah is such that he briefly reminds us of WWII death camps.  Had the film addressed its theme seriously, this might have been forgivable.

If The Island has any enduring message at all it is this - whether we live underground in a controlled environment out of time, or above ground in a semi-futuristic kluge - one thing will always be constant - Steve Buscemi.  His brief appearance, (one assumes he was making a cameo in another mediocre movie nearby when this was being shot), is like everything else you've ever seen him do.  Even the bar he haunts and the bikers he drinks with are present day.  But, can we be sure it's him?  Is it even possible for Buscemi to be in so many movies at once?  Perhaps he was a prototype in the Echo series.  Now that is scary.",1192406400,2,2954,4.801980198019802
849208,4,6304328583,"Life underground is controlled. Everyone wears the same uniform and everyone has a specific job although they don't know the purpose of their jobs. There is a lottery to go to an island get away and all members look forward to this. What do they don't know is that the lottery winners coincide with policy holders needing a body part and that they are the prize.

We both liked this futuristic action about a society of clones who live under ground without knowing who they are. Two of them learn that they are being grown for their body parts for the original host (who thinks they are vegetables) and escape into the outside world to let the real world know what's going on underground.

Beautifully choreographed actions scenes, a good script and a great team of actors help pull off this movie that is somewhat reminiscent to the 70s cult classic Logan's Run. The Island raises the obvious question about how far we should go in cloning research and whether a line must be drawn, where, and just who gets to pick up the pen.

849209,5,6304328583,"The concept behind `The Island' is one that, despite claims of forgery, is quite impressive.  In fact, with the initial concept the script could really have gone one of three ways.  It could have been worked into a thinking man's film, ala `Children of Men' and really been at the head of the Oscar race.  It could have become a strategically executed action film in the vein of, well just about every other Michael Bay film or it could have fallen flat of expectations and really dissolved all potential.  `The Island' decided to take the middle road, and while I would have loved to see this concept taken a little more seriously I can't complain about the outcome.  `The Island' may very well be Michael Bay's best film, although `Armageddon' is still stupendous in my opinion.  Aside from a brilliant synopsis, `The Island' also sports some mind-blowing special effects and some sincere and unexpected performances, especially when you take the genre into account.  Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two brilliant actors and so casting them in this brand of action film was a smart idea.  This film is more than just your typical `blow stuff up' action film for it has heart and moral and emotions and getting two actors who are capable of pulling that off was essential.  I really don't care what others may say, Scarlett Johansson is above and beyond our finest young actress working today.  Anyone who disagrees is just jealous in my opinion.

So I'm ranting and raving about this concept and still I've really said nothing about it.  Well here it goes.  The Island itself is the last livable surface upon the Earth, a beautiful and serene garden where only a select few have the chance of dwelling.  In fact, all of Earth's remaining survivors of the `contamination' are dwelling within a facility completely sealed off from the outside world.  Here they await their selection (via lottery) to leave the facility for life on the island.  The truth behind this though is that these so-called survivors are not even human.  No, the place in which they dwell is not holding grounds for human survivors but a breeding ground for human clones, clones contained and harvested for spare parts.  The lottery selecting the `survivor' heading to `the island' is really sending the selected clone to his or her deathbed as they're essentially murdered and dissected so their human sponsors can live on.

The clones are oblivious to the real goings on of the facility, but they have their speculations and questions that continue to go unanswered.  There is one clone in particular though that has more than a few questions and theories.  Lincoln Six Echo is suffering from strange dreams of a past he can't quite remember.  When he oversees an act of violence that raises a few flags and explains a few concerns he quickly puts the pieces together to realize that this island is not the promised paradise but a reward not worth attaining.  When the lovely Jordan Two Delta is selected to leave he has to work fast to save her life, putting his own in danger.  With the help of an employee to the facility, McCord, both Lincoln and Jordan escape and enter the real world, a world which they know nothing of.  They are soon pursued by bounty hunters while they struggle to find their sponsors in an effort to attain their freedom.  They journey is harrowing, exciting and intense.

The action sequences are astonishing and beautiful to watch and the chemistry between McGregor and Johansson is phenomenal.  The rest of the cast is also well rounded.  Steve Buscemi is fine as McCord.  He has this way about him that makes him almost an essential actor, like any other actor wouldn't do.  My wife hates him but I think he's greatly unappreciated.  Sean Bean is fantastic as the villain Merrick.  He plays a good brand of evil.  Djimon Hounsou is one of my favorite new actors (well, not really `new' but `newer') and here he does a fine job.  In fact his performance as bounty hunter Albert Laurent effortlessly portrays the emotions needed for the pivotal role.  I really want to see this actor shine in years to come.  He's displayed the ability to (in films like `Gladiator' and `In America') but he's also been embraced for less impressive performances (ala `Blood Diamond') so hopefully he'll settle down on perfection and move forward from there.

One performance I wanted to mention was Michael Clarke Duncan's only because it's so short yet so brilliant.  The act of violence Lincoln Six Echo sees involves the murder of Duncan's character Starkweather, and his performance therein is phenomenal.

So, there is a lot of good to look forward to when watching `The Island'.  It's a brilliantly orchestrated science fiction action film that lives up to Michael Bay's name, but it also features some warm and textured performances that help aid in the emotional relevancy of the material.  Sure, it could have gone another route and maybe have been technically a `better' film, but it surely excels in the route is takes and for that we can all be thankful.",1190246400,,5062,4.797921478060046
849210,5,6304328583,"The Island is an incredible sci-fi movie about the struggle to survive and the fight for freedom. It stars Ewan McGregor as Lincoln 6-Echo, who is part of a community of people in 2019, living an existence where every aspect of their lives is monitored and controlled. They have been told that the Earth has suffered a catastrophe, making the outside world poisonous and that they are the only survivors. They lead a boring life where their only hope is that they'll win the lottery and be taken to live on the 'Island', the last uncontaminated place on Earth. Lincoln has a very big problem. He's just discovered that everything he's been told is a lie. Everyone who wins the lottery dies so their organs can be removed. He needs to save his best friend, the dazzlingly beautiful Jordan 2-Delta (Scarlett Johansson), escape the complex, discover the truth about his existence and figure out a way to save everyone else from certain death.

As many people have pointed out there's plenty of action in the movie, especially car chases. But this does not detract from the movie at all. On the contrary it adds to the suspense and really makes the viewer sympathise with Lincoln and Jordan. All they want is to live a normal life but everyone is trying to kill them and the lives of all their friends rests on their survival.

The world of 2019 hasn't changed much from ours. Computers are better, cars look a bit sleeker and there's the occasional jetbike or hovertrain. But the best thing is that you can extend your lifespan by having cloned organ transplants as long as you're rich enough.

But the movie isn't all bleak. The clones are very child-like when it comes to their thoughts and language. Their goofy smiles and confused, naive reactions to various situations provides much comic relief. Steve Buscemi also contributes to the fun. All of the cast give a good performance and there are plenty of interesting characters aside from the main ones. Jones 3-Echo is charmingly naive and Dr. Merrick is a force of pure evil. The Island is definitely a must-have.",1186617600,,2066,4.733333333333333
849211,4,6304328583,"One of the great untold tragedies of the 20th century was the prevalence of medical testing on unwitting subjects.  Some Americans have probably heard of the Tuskegee airmen, black American servicemen who became unwitting test subjects for medical experiments.  But how many people are aware of the medical testing performed on ignorant prisoners, on poor people on various Caribbean islands, or the large-scale testing of vaccines on African villagers throughout the latter half of the 20th century.  The latter tragedy was the background for the movie ""The Constant Gardener"" but it was kept in the background.  This movie takes medical experimentation and puts it front and center in the middle of America.

The plot is simple; two clones discover that they were created to have their organs harvested.  They then fight to escape, and then to help others like them escape.  The story takes on the issues of cloning, genetic engineering, mind control, and even the power of corporations operating in the medical sphere.  Yes the story has the requisite action scenes and love scene needed for any Hollywood flick, but it also has enough scenes to explore the medical and moral issues involved.  We have Lincoln's real counterpart, a rich, spoiled yuppie who needs replacement organs because his are suffering from STD's he has picked up from various women.  Then there is the scene when Scarlett Johansson's character sees the son of her real counterpart.  And then there is the scene where Djimon Hounsou's character parallels the medical cloning with the atrocities he witnessed in his homeland in Africa.

In the finale, the destruction of the underground complex & subsequent exodus scenes are almost identical to ""Logan's Run"". Frankly, I do not recall so many car crashes in a Sci-fi thriller.

849259,4,6304328583,"First, while I very much liked the movie -- it surprised me how good it was - something really irks me about Michael Bay. In his audio commentary, for example, he arrogantly laments the fact that the movie only made $35 million when in opened in the US. He blames it on the marketing campaign. It didn't inform people properly that this was an action movie, he claims. Furthermore, the choice of title detracted from sales because it was ""too complex,"" i.e. not action-sounding enough (although he never mentions a better title; what does he want: Escape of the Clones?).

Michael, Michael, Michael...

The thing that made this movie superior to your other movies was that it was not just another action-packed thriller! It spoke to deeper levels!

Bay is a wonderful technician. He even understands the value of, and often succeeds to some degree, of incorporating a human element in his movies (e.g. father-daughter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>; innocent clones learning about the birds and the bees in this movie). However, the reason he is not in the class of immortal or truly-serious directors is because to him the action is the main thing while the deeper and/or even human elements are secondary -- or worse, merely tools to raise his sales figures (which he never loses an opportunity to remind you of).

Michael, the thing that makes this movie more than just another action flick is that it has depth built into it. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THX-1138/dp/B0002IBJQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THX 1138</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truman-Show/dp/6305252521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Truman Show</a>&nbsp;you have a character (or characters in this case) living more or less unconscious in the womb of a seeming utopia only to discover (i.e. be born into the reality) that there is a real, not-so-utopic existence beyond the literal four walls of their existence. It's both intriguing and stimulating to watch the characters struggle with the feeling that something is just not right with their worlds and then eventually come to the epiphany that they have been had. Like THX and Truman, in The Island the viewer's consciousness of the situation progresses along with the character's level of consciousness, starting with the feeling that something is not right, discovering more things that confirm it, being confused, asking what is going on -- and eventually having it hitting you like a brick that the world is not at all as it seems.

This is one of the things I loved about The Island.

It differs from THX and Truman in that the characters discover the hoax of their lives and emerge into the outside world not just at the end, but in the middle of the movie. This works very well here, in my opinion, because it allows them -- and us -- to explore in greater depth the wonder and horror of the real world they have never been privy to.

In any event, one could argue that such levels of meaning do nothing for, and maybe even detract from, a movie's sales. However, this is the very stuff that makes a movie more than a box office hit padding the director's pocket, but a work that can transcend his life and ours. Unfortunately, it seems this was lost on Bay.

The last point I wanted to make was about the social commentary inherent in this movie. Others have spoken about it. One of the reasons it resonates was because the science bordered on that imaginary line between fiction and reality. The technology is beyond our present level but not so far beyond that it is inconceivable.

Also, these are not the clones of Star Wars, who all look the same, speak the same and are equally devoid of emotion. These are human clones, with the emphasis on human. They may not have developed capacities more than young teenagers, but they are human - in fact, their human capacities are bursting of the seams. (Indeed, their humanity spinning out of their maker's control is one of the things that drives the movie.)

Furthermore, the social commentary aspect of The Island doesn't hit you over the head. You don't get the feeling that this movie was the pet project of some producer/director trying to make a social comment (although the shadow of Spielberg, who recommended Bay for the project, may be present in this regard). It's genuinely an exciting, satisfying sci-fi action movie, which also happens to have a very poignant social comment woven seamlessly into the concept.

However, beyond that, arguably the greatest value of the social commentary in The Island is that it delivers something no congressional hearing or brilliant paper/lecture can do. It makes you FEEL, EXPERIENCE and IDENTIFY with what it would be like to be a clone in a non-clone's world.

The clones are living human beings with the feelings and dreams that have no idea about their destination which is to become the source for matching body parts, blood, and organ of the ones who paid for them. The movie raises very interesting, serious, and important ethical questions but does not have time to stop and to contemplate on them - it is too busy with the non-stoppable fast and furious action sequences.

849332,5,6304328583,"If you've read Jeff Shannon's Editorial Review above, you'll have noted several points open to question.  Mr. Shannon suggests that director Michael Bay's previous work was somewhat lacking in intelligence.  I disagree.  However, let's address this one.

In the beginning, we find ourselves in a sort of post-apocalypse situation.  Something called THE CONTAMINATION has devastated the earth, leaving the machine-like civilization under ground, and, oh, yes, there's an ISLAND somewhere that escaped devastation.  The undergrounders run a lottery that gives random citizens a ticket to the fresh-air paradise of The Island.

The undergrounders are conditioned not to question, but one of them, Lincoln Six Echo (Mr. McGregor) begins to do just that, and quite accidentally discovers that things are going on that the population isn't told about.

Mr. Shannon denotes as antecedents ""Clonus"" as well as several other items.  I find myself thinking that ""The Island"" is a most clever and fast moving mixture of ""Brave New World"", ""THX 1138"", ""The 6th Day,"" and ""The Matrix"", with dashes of ""Transporter"" and even ""Judge Dredd"".

The only aspect I would have asked for more of, would be the sly humor that James Cameron tends to tuck in his work.  And ""The Island"" is a bit predictable in spots, but that isn't always bad.  You can sit there and think about how smart you are, while you enjoy the film.  I did.

Besides Mr. McGregor and an atypically slightly-less-than-sexy Ms. Johansson, one welcomes the neat performances of Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean.

It's also the most ""cerebral"" film I've ever seen Bay do.  The ensemble cast is fantastic, featuring Steve Buscemi, Sean Bean, Ewan McGregor and the stunningly gorgeous Scarlett Johannson.  Djimon Hounsou proves that he is much more than an impressive physique (although I've always thought him a good actor in movies like AMISTAD and GLADIATOR, anyway).

In addition to the cast and direction, the story itself is captivating and it's very, very relevant to our times.  It examines the consequences of taking the extreme end of one side of medical ethics.  What this movie reminded me was of a cross between LOGAN'S RUN and BRAVE NEW WORLD, with a science fiction twist in the plot.

As such, there is a wider & deeper theme of social engineering / manipulation that has nothing to do with medical ethics & everything to do with how much we can trust our government.  How much of what our politicians say is true actually IS true?  How worthy are the people in Washington of our trust?  This is a trenchant question in this day & age of world chaos and corrupt politicians.

Of course, there is also a subtle satire on the concept of religion buried in the tapestry of the story.  In this respect it is much like LOGAN'S RUN.

So, if you're looking for a good action movie that is also a science fiction movie that has a great cast & is well done, this one is for you.  Just remember:  Arbeit macht frie!",1170547200,,1529,4.4855072463768115
849336,4,6304328583,"Michael Bay exemplifies what Hollywood movie should look and feel. The movie's main theme is action packed science fiction and some love story in the middle. However, I find some of the scenes a little bit grainy and hard to really catch the essential elements related to the story. True, Bay showcased a lot of the scenes in such a way that provide the scenes in visual grandeur. This can be attributed to his other movies together with Jerry Bruckheimer like Armageddon, The Rock, Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys sequels. And the very first time that Bay attempted to do this by his own.

The main element of the story is about clones. But, the inner meaning lies on the understanding when we asked the question of who we are, why are we here and what is my purpose in life?

Ewan Mcgregor in a movie about clones, doesn't he have enough with Star Wars already? Mcgregor's character Tom Lincoln is the main protagonist of the story and goes on to find the answer he has been looking for and provide the fulcrum in relating it to the audience as we discover tiny bits of information from one segment to another.

Scarlett Johansson star as Sarah Jordan who was really beautiful in Lost in Translation, but this time around she was able to provide her other acting side which is action. Other notables in the film include Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, Sean Bean and Steve Buscemi, but the focus was still on the two main characters.

Overall, there is nothing new about the story and sort of like reminds you of Logan's Run. I guess other blockbusters that come out this summer would definitely overshadow the movie.

849337,3,6304328583,"Michael Bay has a lot of good movies under his umbrella. However, whether producing or directing, greatness has eluded him. The aversion to greatness held true under his direction of The Island.

The Island is a good movie. Tons of action. Funny moments. Good suspense. And good acting by A-list actors. It's has a very cool story concept....

It's too bad that cool story concepts with clever twists are often ruined for viewers that have not yet seen a film by reviewers that think it's a good idea to tell the story of what happened in a movie instead of giving thoughts on whether it is worthy of viewing. The neat little plot twist in The Island is so ""out"" that most viewing this movie already know the strange intricacies of the world that the two stars live in.

Kudos to Michael Bay for not divulging the twist in the trailers to the movie.

Hopefully you're reading this, and only this, as your basis to view, because I won't spoil it for you. I will say that Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor are excellent in their rolls as two escapees from an isolated colony designed to keep out the contaminations of a world gone bad.

McGregor and Johansson flee through a futuristic city into extremely over the top situations where they survive what no else could possibly survive through. And this sensational, death defying ability of the two to stay alive really takes away from what could have been a much more realistic look at a possibility of something that could happen in the not too distant future.

At least if the plot has already been ruined for you, the movie's entertainment value is not completely lost. It's a fun movie to watch that you can catch on cable as of this writing; no need to buy or rent unless you don't get any of the pay channels.

So if you've got no new movies to look at in your queue and you see that there's a showing of The Island in your On Demand service...go for it. It's time well spent watching some Survivors getting cast off to Exile Island.",1169683200,,1991,4.498614958448753

The world has been largely wiped out by some contamination, and the only survivors live in a utopian compound where a lottery chooses some to go to the only uncontaminated place left on Earth: The Island. The inanity of the utopian life is poignant, made more so in Lincoln 6 Echo's concern over the loss of one of his white shoes, (another colour would be nice, he comments).

Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are both surprising in the ways in which they adapt to the roles. McGregor, who usually comes across as a bit spineless in some roles, makes a good show of it later in this film. His change of character typing was excellently done. Johansson, perceived as somewhat more suited to the quiet, light comedy roles of ""Lost in Translation"", makes the jump to sci-fi actioner easily, becoming a definite action queen. Both of them did exceptionally well in this role.

The special effects are awesome, making the film all the more realistic and impacting. The use of the natural light to bring across a warm and hazy glow of summer also added something to the overall feel of the movie. Among the sci-fi movies of recent times, I would rank ""The Island"" as among the best for technical quality.

While the plot starts off with some surprises, keeping the viewers in suspense, the later parts descend into somewhat cliched and corny lines. The ending itself was somewhat overdone and superficial, which did not enhance the movie itself. However, the previous couple of hours were so good that I found myself not minding the film's plummet into predictable sentimentality so much.

The Island started pretty well. Production design was great. The story was intriguing. Very nice job of introducing questionable elements into the 'perfect society'. I thought Michael Bay was going to surprise me. The product placement was irritating and cheesy, but I could live with it. While the writing was pretty corny, it was still nice to see Michael Bay trying something a little different for him. Something smarter. But once our heroes escape, the movie nosedives. It felt like two completely different movies were tacked together.

As I said, I was enjoying the beginning. The survivors of an unspecified ""contamination"" dwell within a sterile, self-contained city. Their happiness and well being is paramount to those in charge. They are watched over and coddled. They have no real concerns. They live a life of leisure while holding out hope that they will be the next lottery winner, which promises them a one-way trip to The Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth.

There is currently a lawsuit against Bay brought by the makers of ""Parts"", which should be an open-and-shut case.

This film is set in a futuristic clone colonie, where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts. The clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility's employees, not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise (the Island). Of course, the clones allegedly going to the Island are actually being euthanized for their organs, their patrons having gotten sick. The movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise. Ewan McGregor is satisfactory in this role, his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge. His female counterpart, Scarlet Johansen, is pure eye candy, a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead (or even a major part) in a college play (the best performance is turned in by Sean Bean, the Evil Scientist.)There is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on, making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie, but it is not only nothing special, it is nothing original.

Their memories have been programmed and they are under the impression that they are being groomed for a trip to ""The Island,"" a distant paradise that is free from this alleged contamination. Needless to say, there is a much more sinister reason for their captivity, and when McGregor's character discovers clues to their real purpose, the plot begins to unfold.

Scarlett Johansson is absolutely lovely and certainly added to this film's appeal for me. McGregor gives a great performance and certainly carries the film as the lead actor.

McGregor and Johansen are good choices for their parts and play them well.  The supporting cast also does its job well with Steve Buschemi adding a littlecomic relief here and there.

Sure, the action was over the top at times but Ive come to expect this with action movies so I can forgive the slight un-plausability of a few of the escape and action scenes. They didn't detract from the movie at all and this is whats important.  The film raises some very interesting questions about humanity and whats really ""fair"". Are clones real people?

I even like Ewan McGregor in this movie, and he is not one of my favorite actors- i.e., if you have seen the new Star Wars movies, you'll know what I mean. The plot is fluent and understandable, and even the comic relief was well placed and effective.

849436,5,6304328583,"The Island is a slick, fast-moving sci-fi story about the horrors of the cloned-world.  It tells of a time when a society refuses to see the truth, but instead puts a smokescreen around the truth.  What are the smokescreens that create the horror?  They are many: 1) The privileged people kill other people for their own privilege and health.  Note very carefully in this film: There are no obligations discussed by the privileged, only their rights.  When the ""human"" Lincoln meets his clone, the ""human"" one treats the clone like......well......a mindless, soulless clone.  It is fascinating that the major figure who helps the clone, who sees his humanity, is an African-American, whose ancestors, and perhaps even he himself, have been seen as mindless, soulless less-than-humans; 2) Those privileged people do not allow themselves to look into the dark, protected world of the clones.  That which you can't see is that about which you can't feel guilty; 3) The most chilling aspect of the film is the use of euphemisms, words that cloud real meanings.  You know what I mean: In Vietnam, the enemies were ""gooks,"" for example.  Well, in this futuristic tale, we hear the ""humans"" refer to the clones as ""insurance policies"" and ""products.""  I urge the viewer to listen carefully to the other euphemisms sprinkled throughout the movie.  This movie is more about words than action scenes. The euphemisms are the truly chilling parts of it all.  Can anyone say ""embryonic stem cells""?  Does anyone still wish to do so after watching this film? If so, then why don't we all stay above ground, not venture into the underground womb of the clones, and pass the soma around.  We all need a good high to keep us creative so that we can keep the euphemisms coming.",1156291200,4,1759,4.859060402684563

To a degree the movie is inspired by the far-superior (and non-religious) sci-fi film Gattaca.  I will give The Island credit for one thing though, it has an absolutely great chase scene in the movie (the one with the flying motorcycles).",1156032000,,453,4.947368421052632
849502,5,6304328583,"Since I deeply appreciated the above 'products', I really enjoyed THE ISLAND.  Because this film was panned by the critics and because it sort of just came and went in the movie theaters, I only watched because there was nothing else on cable.  I decided to give it thirty minutes and then turn the television off and return to one of the delicious books on my nightstand.  I was absolutely shocked at how good THE ISLAND was; subsequently, I watched the entire movie!

In the year 2050, wealthy individuals purchase a 'product' (for the cost of five million dollars) that is supposedly a mass of protoplasm.  Then, when they desire a baby, or if an organ becomes sick or worn out, they receive a replacement.  Instead of masses of protoplasm, exact clones are being born, raised, and harvested in what used to be an abandoned and hidden underground military installation.  Dr. Merrick (played as usual by a convincing Sean Beam) is the director of this high tech compound who performs his experiments and murders with the consent of the U. S. Government.  Disappearances of these clones are explained by the announcement on large screens that they have won a lottery to the island.  This is what keeps the residents of this installation happy, the thought of leaving their boring lives or performing menial tasks.

Ewan McGregor as ""Lincoln 6 Echo"" seems to have developed a superior intellect and eventually figures out what is happening.  During a long escape sequence he brings along Scarlet Johansson's ""Jordan 2 Delta"" who is his best friend.  There is not romance here; in fact, males and females are not allowed to even communicate whilst imprisoned.  Mercenaries are hired to track and kill the fugitive clones.  Eventually our lead characters not only prevail, but they finally bond!

I really enjoyed sitting on the edge of my seat during this movie.  Yes, there was a lot of shoot-em-up violence, a lot of wrecked vehicles and a lot of people being blown apart but it really added to this thrilling production.  I like futuristic dramas with a good story and identifiable heroes so THE ISLAND ended up being a pleasant surprise.  It was really, really good!",1155859200,3,2169,4.8478260869565215
849503,4,6304328583,"The Island has an intriguing premise for the first half of the film, and I was reminded of some of the better parts of George Lucas' ""THX 1138"", The Matrix series, Orwell's ""1984"", Crichton's ""Coma"" and ""Logan's Run"". A group of adults live in a tightly controlled sci-fi high-rise wearing identical white jumpsuits.  Everything from their diet to their education is guided by other adults who seem to be at this commune to ""care"" for the inhabitants.  We are shown scenes where these inhabitants are told repeatedly that the ultimate experience is to win ""The Lottery"" where they are taken from the institute to ""The Island"".  The Island, they are told, is the last pathogen-free environment left in the world after an event that has contaminated the entire world.

At this point you don't know exactly what the purpose of the place is, or what ""The Island"" actually means, but by the mid-point of the film Ewan McGregor's ""Lincoln 6 Echo"" has figured it out and brought along Scarlet Johansson's ""Jordan 2 Delta"". Sean Bean plays the Doctor who is the head of the entire operation and Djimon Hounsou plays a mercenary who is brought in with a team of tough-guys to corral Lincoln and Jordan and protect the secret of The Island.  Steve Buscemi steals his few scenes as an institute employee who is torn between his compassion for Lincoln and Jordan and the knowledge that doing anything actively against the institute is just asking for big trouble.  All other characters have dialogue that moves the story along while Buscemi's McCord has several lines that provide the only comic relief to the picture.  McCord befriends Lincoln early in the film and at the midway point is the character who gets to give Lincoln and Jordan a crash course in ""being human"".  Explaining about ""God"" he says: ""Well, you know, when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it? God's the guy that ignores you.""

Now - I haven't said hardly anything about the actual plot, because finding out the secrets with Lincoln and Jordan is most of the fun of the film.  If the film had stayed smart I'd likely have given 5 stars and might consider it one of the greatest of science fiction films.  Instead, Michael Bay uses the last half of the film to stage a series of absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic chase scenes.  Lincoln and Jordan, although only human, live through a few events that would leave other humans not only dead, but with mutilated, mangled corpses.  After one such event a building worker pulls them to safety saying ""I KNOW Jesus is with you!""

I felt like saying ""Hey... what is this? I was using my brain back there...""  For the final half of the film - go ahead and turn your brain off.",1154995200,2,2718,4.668763102725367
849504,3,6304328583,"Mimicking ideas and plotlines exposed better in 1970s movies such as ""Soylent Green"", ""Logan's Run"" and ""Planet of the Apes"", ""The Island"" is an action sci-fi flick about an underclass of people (clones, really) that don't know their role until a hero follows a bug up a pipeline and finds out the truth.

Then, in a series of scenes very much like those we saw in another 1970s flick, ""Coma"", our hero runs away with the beautiful lead female and eventually makes everyone aware of what's happening.

This oversimplistic description nevertheless captures just about all the originality of this movie, which seems pretty good for about 40 minutes until all the flicks you saw earlier in your life that deal with these issues start to spring to memory. Perhaps ""Logan's Run"", where the underground underclass discovers the real world and runs away to it, is the principal motivation for this film, which is clearly a sequel to a number of earlier flicks.

Ewan McGregor is pretty good here in a dual role, in one of which he actually sounds like himself. But he is a shell of the actor that played the lead in ""Trainspotting"", a truly original movie where McGregor was directed in a way that fulfilled nearly all his capacity.

The female lead, played by Scarlet Johanson, is even less realistic or artful. She is mainly given over to smiling in the film's first hour and making outlandish surprise looks after she and the hero find out what's going on.

The final verdict on this movie: I watched it Saturday night, thought about all the movies it copied, and didn't remember anything about it Sunday morning. A half-hour conversation with my wife and 18-year-old granddaughter helped me remember enough to write this review.

Chalk this up as another episode in the 'oughts (or 2000s or new century) efforts as sequel-prequel making in the movies.",1154908800,,1848,4.832278481012659
849505,2,6304328583,"The Island, starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, is a weakly written and even more inadequately made dramatic sci-fi action thriller. It tells the story of Lincoln and Jordan, two clones that fight back after they find out that they are walking talking ""spare part"" insurance policies, set mostly in LA in the year 2019.

Billed as the Summer Action event of 2005, here the movie does not disappoint. This film has as many action stunts as it does holes in the plot (I wonder if that is a coincidence). 136 minutes of wrecks, chases, and explosions. All one thing after another, it was almost as if they did not want to give you any time to think about how many people died in the wake of all that destruction. In fact I think the absurd action points are the only thing that outnumbers the product shots. This was most certainly the longest commercial I have ever seen.

Michael Bay does a masterful job of limiting the scope of the film while still maintaining the perfect amount of disconnect between the characters and their audience. His too close close-ups succeed greatly in showing me Ewan's pores but they fail miserably in preserving a smooth aesthetic continuity. Aiding in this task is the awkward high contrast color and blinding artificial camera flares.

In summary, The Island is an ambitious film that tries hard to become one of the unforgettable Sci-Fi classics by emulating movies like Logan's Run, the Matrix, Equilibrium, and Total Recall. It fails. It sucks. On a sci-fi/action scale of 1-10 (1 being House of the Dead and 10 being Raiders of the Lost Ark) I would give it a 4.

849507,5,6304328583,"First off, lots of people seem to be angered by the product placement in this movie. Chill out! If the makers want to save a few hundred thousand dollars, that's their right. Go make your own ad-free movie if you hate it so much. Advertisements have made millions of movies and television shows possible. Yeah, I suppose they can be irritating, but there are more important things in life to worry about than the ""evils"" of advertising. Get over it, people, and enjoy the movie. You see advertising everywhere else in the world, anyway. Shouldn't you be used to it? I am. It hardly bothers me anymore - really.

Some people also think that this movie has too much action in it. Well, is action such a bad thing? It works well for certain types of movies. In Gattaca, for example, there wasn't much action, and that was fine. In The Island, I don't think the action took away from its worth. And, after all, this movie is in the Action genre (as well as the Science-fiction, Drama, and Thriller genres).

Scarlett J is annoying as she is in most movies, but Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean were excellent.  I thought it was cruel of Dr Merrick (Bean) to say that the clones didn't have souls. What would they lack souls? They are still people. And that's really the point of the movie, I think.

Plot synopsis: things explode, a handheld camera jerks about, McGregor or Johansson shout ""Go!"", ""Run!"", or ""No!"", and then the token black dude turns out not to be evil at all.

Some of the action was over the top but I found it to be a mere sideshow to the story which was engaging throughout. There were some plot holes but which movie doesn't have them.

You will pause to reflect the seamy side of cloning and future utility by the wealthy.

849567,3,6304328583,"Set in the year 2019, ""The Island"" provides yet another dystopian view of the future, one in which mankind must grapple with ethical questions specifically related to how he will use the technology he's created.  In this case, it  has to do with human cloning and how far we are willing to go to prolong our own hitherto limited life spans - and at whose expense.

Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two young people living in a hermetically sealed world after some sort of global ""contamination"" has ostensibly rendered the majority of the outside world uninhabitable (all except an island paradise that the people living here can travel to if they are lucky enough to win it as a prize in a lottery).  Recently, however, McGregor has come to question many of the ""truths"" he sees in the world around him, wondering if there isn't some other, more sinister and diabolical explanation than the one he has been given by the powers-that-be, who monitor and run virtually every aspect of not only his life but the lives of those living and working alongside him.

Watching ""The Island"" is a bit like riding on a train that runs along smoothly for the most part, yet keeps jumping off the tracks at frequent and inconvenient intervals.  You eventually arrive at where you're going, but there's an awful lot of frustration and delay in getting there.  When the screenplay concentrates on the moral and ethical implications raised by its brave-new-world premise, the film is often incisive, thoughtful and compelling.  Yet, as this is a Michael Bay film, the audience can't be allowed to become TOO thoughtful, so the filmmaker loads on one lame action scene after another to the point where the issues become buried under all the pyrotechnics.  Every so often those issues manage to rise again to the surface only to be pushed back down by seemingly endless high speed car chases, earsplitting explosions and shattering glass that cascades in slow motion streams onto hero, villain and innocent bystander alike.

McGregor and Johansson aren't given much to do in the way of acting in the film, but Steve Buscemi manages to create something of a genuine character in the few scenes he is given.  The art direction and set design are highly impressive and the over-the-top action scenes are admittedly well mounted and executed, even though they wind up weakening the movie.  Yet, just when you're about to give up on it, ""The Island"" manages to climb back onto the rails and get you interested in it again.

849570,4,6304328583,"After watching ""The Island"" I could not for the life of me figure out why more people were not talking about it, I don't think it was the critics reveiws because they (for the most part) praised the film. It definatly was not the lack of big name stars (it had Ewan Mcgregor & Scarlett Johanson...) or the asumed work of an unknown director (it was directed by widley known Director, Micheal Bay) and there was no way the people didn't go see it because of a lack of suspence or action! (it had a budget of around 120 million, most of which was spent on special effects and/or action...). Overall though if you really take a look, it was not that the film didn't do well, because it did (grossing 160 million) but I really cant figure out why the United States only contributed to 35 million of that? I think that it is just that the box office is completely up in the air and can even be somewhat random..., there have been some major Box-office bombers, the most recent being Poseidon which lost tons, there have also been some films that have a budget of near nothing that gross over 100 million (some recent ones being Saw 2, March Of the Penguins and Napolean Dynamite).

""The Island"", though somewhat confusing and slow at the get go, really starts to speed in what makes for an excellent big-budget action adventure. The leading roles starring McCgregor & Johanson are very well played and the supporting cast does a decent job as well. Though it can appear to be somewhat jumbled as well as puzzling at the beginning it really comes together well. I thought that there was some very clever ideas and some comic relief throughout.

849572,4,6304328583,"I have to confess to being a Michael Bay fan. I make a big show about preferring movies for the thinking man, but that doesn't mean I don't like a good action movie every now and then, and Bay is one of the best directors of the genre. The Rock is one of the best action movies of all time, and Pearl Harbor was one of the better historical epics of the last few years. Bay gets knocked as being a director whose only talent is shooting cars flipping end over end down the interstate, but I don't think that's fair at all. He's actually very good at portraying strong characters and interesting dramatic plotlines as well.

But with The Island Bay takes a shot at a science fiction movie for the thinking man, combined with (of course) the obligatory cars somersaulting down the interstate and slo-motion shots of sunglass-wearing beefcakes getting out of high-priced sports cars. The result is one of the most underrated big-budget films of last year. The Island is a classic science fiction tale. By that I mean that it serves what I call the ""prophetic function"" of sci-fi by issuing a strong warning about the dangers of divorcing advanced technology from traditional moral foundations. In the simplest terms, the film portrays consumerism and the modern obsession with maintaining youth and beauty as paving the way for human genocide. The main characters are actually clones harvested by a genetic engineering company. Rich people pay up to $5 million to grow a clone as a repository for spare body parts or even to bear the burden of carrying a child. Once the clone has served his purpose, he is exterminated. They are not seen as people but as ""products.""

The film uses various methods to display this extermination that are meant as clear parallels to the history of genocide in the real world. When a batch of ""defective products"" is herded into a gas chamber to be ""recalled,"" the allusion to Nazi Germany is clear, if not downright heavy-handed. Likewise, when other defective products are cut from the artificial growth sacks in which they are being harvested, I couldn't help but see a parallel with abortion, even though I highly doubt the writers meant it that way. In a world where clones are a possibility, where human DNA is mixed with animal DNA (for research purposes only, of course) and where the desire for designer babies has reduced the birth-rate of Down's Syndrome infants to near zero, the message of The Island is one that modern humanity needs a good solid dose of: all human life is sacred. Period. That kind of prophetic warning is a mark of good science fiction, and The Island is a good science fiction film.

849636,4,6304328583,"After the bad press & disappointing box office when the film was release I did have mixed feelings about the film.

So, now that I have purchased the DVD & seen the film I am happy.

Not the best film ever made, but I did enjoy it.

2005 press made it sound like it was a film full of things blowing up.  These scenes did NOT even start until over an hour after the film began.

True, some scenes & situations you could see coming a mile a way.  I knew Djmon's character would turn at the end.

I was, however, TRULY DISAPPOINTED about how little Michael was used in the film.  2 scenes & his character on a bill board.  THAT WAS IT!!  Why did the credits NOT read ""Special Appearance BY Michael Clarke Duncan""?

Liked Ewan in the film.

Over all an enjoyable action film.

DVD package-I HATE, HATE, HATE, these packages with the little flip down openings.  THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!",1148774400,,877,4.300613496932515
849637,3,6304328583,"'The Island' could have been great, but it turned out to be simply good; not even very good.

The film starts off very, very well, in what appears to be a '1984'-type totalitarian state, but once Lincoln Six Echo discovers the truth, or even from the moment he starts to suspect that something is afoot, the film just goes from bad to worse. The action is far too OTT, and completely unrealistic. If you're after good car chase sequences then watch either of the 'Bourne' films, or better still, 'Ronin.' The island provided plenty of thrills, but only the type that satisfy the most shallow of action film junkies. I personally love action films, (such as 'Die Hard' or 'Aliens.' They're both action classics and i adore them) but they have to have some substance as well as eye-popping visuals in order to be a good film overall.

There are other parts of the film that appealed; when Lincoln and Jordan are in the 'real' Tom Lincoln's house, and the bit in the biker bar, just after they've broken out. Suddenly the character based dialogue is back, and Ewan, (both of them!) and Scarlett show that they can act. It's a shame the film doesn't contain more scenes like this, as the two leads are very good. As it turns out, Michael Bay suffocates nearly all of their talent, reducing the film to a ridiculous special FX bonanza, which is mildly boring and unrealistic.

This film isn't all bad. It's really gutting to have a movie that started off so well, and then had nearly all the potential sucked out of it by a complete moron of a director. As well as the more intimate scenes between Scarlett and Ewan, the music is really good, and Sean Bean puts in his usual top-draw performance; if Sean was in it more he might have made this a 4* star film. Alas, his talent is a bit wasted.

If you want a modern sci-fi action/chase film, then watch 'Minority Report' which is brilliant. If you have to watch a Michael Bay film, then watch 'Armageddon' which has just as much action, etc. as 'The Island' and it's a decent film to boot.",1148342400,2,2034,4.489189189189189

* Highly monitored, like The Truman Show (and THX-1138): check

849642,4,6304328583,"While watching the first hour of this movie i was shocked and disturbed, to see people treated like that. Then i asked myself why i was so shocked, the answer that came to me is that i realised i knew already that something similiar is already happening in our world, in China. We also do this to animals all the time and what can be done to an animal can easily be transferred to humans, thus the first hour of the movie convinced me i was watching a horror movie.

The seriousness of the films' plot is betrayed in the middle of the film by some unnecessary humour devices (the constant references to the physical endowments of the female lead are not funny in a film in which people are treated as sides of beef in other ways). Also the cliche of the redneck/biker bar and the gay misunderstanding in the toilet add nothing to the realism or tension which the film should be trying to maintain at this point in the movie.

The villains of the film are truly vile, the facility staff have convinced themselves of the non-human status of the inmates and smirk as a man wakes up during organ removal, only to be dragged back to the lab for his nightmare to continue. Organs are products and the product is best harvested from a body with a beating heart and an intact brain, such is the economics of the organ industry. The staff are led by a cold hard faced scientist who is utterly irredeemable as a human being, he is given a chilling portrayal by Sean Bean. What makes the scientists doubly evil is that they know what they are doing is murder but have taught themselves to view it differently.

Ewan McGregor gives a satisfactory performance as one of the inmates, who accidentally pierces the web of lies and illusions designed to keep the inmates docile and ignorant. He escapes with Scarlett Johannsen and together they seek out their real-life counterparts, to discover their purpose and to expose the illegal activities taking place at the facility.

There are plenty of car chases, fight scenes, helicopter and hoverbike scenes there to keep action fans very happy as the facility uses deadly killers to track them down and exterminate them to keep their secret safe. The ending was slightly predictable and a little unsatisfying, those who escaped can never be homefree until their faces are on every news channel in the world, this should have been explored. Also there was not enough anger in McGregor's confrontation with the evil scientist, this was a by-the-numbers kind of fight which strangely involves the transformation of our erstwhile brittle lab-geek into a proficient brawler, considering all the special forces people our hero had sent down at this point it seemed inappropriate. All in all it is an enjoyable film which is entertaining and informative but which still gives a regretfully light treatment of what is today a topical and very serious subject.

849643,5,6304328583,"Lincoln 6 (Ewan MacGregor) and Jordan 2 (Scarlett Johansson) are among tens of thousands brought up in a closed environment where they are led to believe that the outside world is too polluted to survive in.  In actuality, they are all clones of wealthy humans who have paid handsomely for the clones' body parts.

The clones are told of an unpolluted Nirvana, ""the Island,"" in the outside world, and believe that the luckiest among them are chosen by lottery to be sent to enjoy the rest of their lives on this earthly paradise.  The reality is that the ""lottery winners"" are those deemed ready to be killed so that their body parts can be transplanted to their wealthy ""sponsors."" Instead of an Island paradise, they are sent to die on an operating table.

Lincoln 6 and Jordan 2 learn the truth and escape to the outside world. They are pursued by the agents of the cloning enterprise.

It all works very well. ""The Island"" is an excellent film that is both highly entertaining and thought provoking.

The only negative thing I can say about it is that it is not the most original film you will see.  It owes a lot to Logan's Run.

Logan's Run wasn't about cloning. Instead it was about a closed environment where people are killed, after being led to believe they are being ""reborn,"" when they reach the age of thirty.  Logan and a female companion escape to the outside world where they are pursued by an agent of the closed society.

849644,5,6304328583,"I cannot believe people stayed away from this movie when it came out in theatres. Look folks, Bay has given us some of the greatest rollercoaster rides of the last twenty years: Bad Boys II, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, Bad Boys I, a Lionel Richie video, so anyone who calls his work ""slow-motion drivel"" or ""creatively bankrupt,"" is just not grasping what Bay is trying to do. And for the reviewer who says Bay uses ""explosions to mask his talent""? Well, that's just mean-spirited. And yes, Bay yells a lot on the set, he does so because he's a perfectionist and yelling makes everything perfect. And everyone who's saying that Bay is just an example of nepotism because he imagines his dad to be John Frankenheimer can stick it in their ear. And by the way, I have an official leather bomber coat from the Pearl Harbor movie that you cannot borrow. I don;t think it's real leather, but a new fabric that Michael created called ""Bayther."" Bayther is superior to leather because it explodes and yells a lot at people. I also have a ""Jaime Foxx Show"" jacket that I will lend you cause it's kind of out of style. And Bay maniacally yells at the crew for a reason, he wants them to be everythign they can be. Another bonus is it feeds his ego and makes him feel important.

849704,4,6304328583,"The Island, the latest Michael Bay film, released in the summer of 2005 had a lot going against it.  First, it was a Michael Bay film.  Second, it had an original plot and was not a sequel or a remake.  Third, the title ""The Island"" seemed ambiguous.  I think this is definitely a movie you should check out.

The first act is captivating, the world where these people live.  They work, eat, and live in an isolated area on the earth to protect them from the contaminated earth atomosphere.  At random times, a lottery is held to determine a winner.  This winner gets to go to the island, the last safe place on earth.

Ewan McGregor as Lincoln and Scarlett Johanssen as Jordan are friends.  Jordan's name is drawn.  Before she departs for the island, Lincoln discovers something is drastically wrong.  She isn't going to the island, she is going to die.  Lincoln and Jordan escape and must be tracked down before the secret about the Island can be revealed.  The movie then procedes to be a standard action thriller with a few touching moments.  McGregor and Johanssen are great and this movie is worth watching for their performance and for the first act of the movie.  If the emotional ramifications of the Island, specifically Jordan's phone conversation with a little boy, had been explored more, this would have been even a better movie.",1144800000,,1343,4.6752136752136755
849705,1,6304328583,"The very fact that this film has received so many positive ratings indicates how starved American movie audiences are for anything that even attempts to make them think.  Despite a fascinating premise and an extraordinary cast (including not only Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson but Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi, and the always superb Djimon Hounsou), The Island falls terribly flat. Once again, Michael Bay seems convinced that a movie's quality is directly proportionate to the number of explosions, flipping cars, and, of course, crashing helicopters. The Island is, without question, his best film, which makes it almost worthy of the discount rack.

Sadly, many directors believe they can dress up another mind-numbing action movie in pretentious, but trite, metaphysical ponderings (see The Matrix I, II, & III).  I can only shudder to think what this extraordinary cast thought when they saw the final cut. I guess every actor needs an Ishtar on his or her resume.",1144713600,3,972,5.217948717948718
849706,1,6304328583,"Can't anyone write an original sci-fi script today? The Island borrows heavily from Logans Run in that everyone lives in a big mall, wears coordinated running suits, have wacky names that contain a greek numeral or two and are lied about the outside world. Gee I always thought living in a mall was not reality or a good place to spend your life.  Instead of your 30th birthday it is your client or gene donor's need for a new organ or two that ends your time listening to muzak on malls multi-levels.  Okay this is the most cutting edge mall ever put on the big screen, the sets are gorgeous in an ultra minimalist cutting edge look. When the predictable happens and our lead characters or should I say lead clones break loose all hell breaks loose as well.  They make it to Los Angeles of the future which has nothing but glass towers and a few abandoned movie palaces which make for the perfect place to crash a helicopter, car or motorcycle. The chase scenes are spectacular in a CGI way yet boring after the third or fourth truck flip. The stunts and crashes  add no suspense to the film but instead stop the film in its tracks. I don't want to be a spoiler here but if you are over 25 you will have no trouble guessing what comes next. The final ending after what appears to be the ending plays like a Stallone classic.  It's not over till the corporate bad guys gets his after a hand to hand battle of good versus evil. From here the film heads back to Logan's Run with the release of the mall residents and a ""I'd like to teach the world to sing"" final shot. If you actually care to take the time to think about this one your brains will hurt from its swiss cheese plot.

I felt like I didn't want to write a review, since so many people before me have explained it so well, yet I felt like I wanted to show my love and support for the enjoyment it brought me and everyone else who saw it with me.

I loved how the characters did things that you wanted them to do; they reasoned, they fought and the sure ran a lot, but they were doing things that finally made sense! I was tired of watching movies where the characters did stupid stuff, they got trapped and in trouble. This movie was different, it had brawn and brains, some nail biting moments and probably the best car chase  I have ever seen! I clapped at one part, because this turned out to be a juicy, adrenaline pumped hard core action thriller, full of entertainment with some fantastic science-fiction.

The whole story of Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor), Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson) and all their quirky and charming friends really grew on it me as I was dying to see the outcome of the story. I absolutely loved the ending, as it was meaty, satisfying and high-five; a type of movie that makes you feel satisfied through the entertainment versus a movie that makes you feel like you just lost two hours of your life.

If you want to see the scary future possibility of  full on censorship, sterile homes and out of this world structures then sit back and watch this, it's a great movie.

849710,3,6304328583,"This film gets off to an interesting and edgy start. The time is the not-so-distant future. The location is a strangely antiseptic and sterile world,  where humanity supposedly lives in a  protected, artificial environment. Men and woman are segregated in separate housing. They  work at assigned tasks, wear the clothes they are given to wear, eat what they are told to eat, and every move they make is controlled and choreographed by an unseen force. Presiding over their supposed well-being is Merrick (Sean Bean).

This multitude of beings believe that they are where they are due to a contamination of the Earth's environment. There is, however, a place on Earth to which they all aspire to go: the island, a utopian paradise, free from the contamination that purportedly covers most of Earth. The only way to get to the island is via a lottery. The ostensibly lucky winner is told to pack his or her bags and is then whisked away, never again to be seen.

This is the world of Lincoln Six Echo  (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). They, too, wait for the day when they will win the lottery. There is, however,  something about Lincoln Six Echo that does not quite conform to what passes for the norm in this controlled environment. Consequently, he comes under the scrutiny of Merrick, who is really sort of a futuristic Dr. Mengele. Lincoln Six Echo's problem is his curiosity, which leads him on a voyage of discovery. What he discovers is shocking. So, when his best friend, Jordan Two Delta, wins the lottery and is scheduled to be transported to the island, he goes into action mode.

It is no secret that this film is about clones and the harvesting of their body parts for well-heeled clients who keep the clones as a back-up in case something goes wrong with their own bodies. The movie starts off quite promisingly, with its cutting edge plot, which provides much food for thought, and the faintly creepy, highly stylized, futuristic world that they inhabit. The film, however,  begins its downward spiral the minute it goes into action mode. In fact, in one of the featurettes, the director, Michael Bay, basically says that at some point he told his special effects people just to load up the film with action scenes and he would work around it.  Consequently, the plot takes a turn for the totally ridiculous. The film also has a final twist that is just simply not believable. It is unfortunate that this director has not yet realized that less is sometimes more.

Wonderful performances are given by the entire cast, with special kudos to Ewan McGregor who effectively plays a dual role (Lincoln Six Echo and Tom Lincoln). Scarlett Johansson brings a fresh faced naivete to her role as
Jordan Two Delta. Steve Buscemi plays McCord, a creepy little guy that Buscemi makes strangely disarming and likable. Sean Bean is coolly sinister as Merrick, the futuristic Dr. Mengele prototype. Dimon Hounsou is well-cast as Albert Laurent, the security expert hired to take care of the developing situation by any means necessary. Michael Clark Duncan gives an  especially poignant performance as Starkweather, one of the lottery winners, as does Ethan Phillips in the role of Jones Three Echo.

Despite the film's intriguing premise, it ultimately fails in its execution. The director succumbs to a need for excess, leaving the intelligent storyline in the wake of a deep rooted need for excessive and unbelievable action scenes and a twist that no one with an ounce of brains would believe. It is too bad, as the director had all the ingredients for a gourmet feast, but, instead, chose to serve the viewer the equivalent of a fast food burger. Still, sci-fi junkies will find a modicum of enjoyment in this well-acted film, as will those who enjoy aggressive action sequences in their films.",1143331200,7,3826,4.858678955453149

849712,5,6304328583,"The Island was released as a summer `blockbuster' movie but surprisingly, did not do well at the box office in spite of good reviews from the critics. Ewan Mcgregor stars alongside Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean, certainly big enough names to whet the appetite and to indicate a film worth seeing.

McGregor plays Lincoln Six Echo, a man living in the sterile, self-contained city that lies beneath the Earth that was supposedly ravaged by contaminants and rendered uninhabitable. Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) is his friend although any close relationships are strongly discouraged. Life in this world is strictly controlled and anyone deviating from the `norm' faces a visit to sinister Dr Merrick (Bean). The only ray of hope in the citizen's lives is to win the lottery. Winners are sent to The Island, the last uncontaminated place on earth where people can live free and breath fresh air. Lincoln Six Echo starts to question his existence, becoming increasingly unsettled; this concern is rapidly increased when Jordan wins the lottery. He snoops around before she has to leave and what he discovers about `the island' sends him and Jordan fleeing from the safety of their world to the outside. A crack team of mercenaries, hired by Merrick, are sent to capture and return the fugitives.

The Island is a fast paced, action filled, special effects packed movie and certainly a high quality production that deserved better recognition than it got, Any fan of action films (not just sci-fi) should enjoy this. The downside of the DVD is the lack of extras but this seems to increasingly be the norm, as distributors seem to delight in bringing out `special' editions several months later to encourage buyers to part with more money. The only extras are subtitles, theatrical trailer and a `making of' featurette. The quality of picture and sound are, however, of excellent quality so unless you are desperate for extra features I would go ahead and get the film now, it's worth parting with your pennies for.",1143072000,,2028,4.997041420118343
849713,3,6304328583,"The Island was a movie that was hyped quite a bit prior to its release in 2005 but it did horribly at the box office.  The critics did not pan it, in fact I remember it getting decent reviews.  I thought this was a good movie that too many people missed even if it did have some flaws.

The movie starts off with our introduction to a colony of humans who are told they are the surviors of a some catastrophy that were saved and taken to the shelter by the people that chaparon them now.  The people live in the enclosed enviroment but are told the outside is contaminated so they can only go one at a time to ""the island"" which is the last uncontaminated spot.  Here we are introduced to Lincoln 6 Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan 2 Delta (Scarlett Johansson) who are best friends living in this futuristic utopia.  Everything on the surface seems nice, but little things show themselves like Lincoln's diet is very strict and men and women are not able get too close to one another.  Lincoln is especially curious and befriends one of the chaparons (Steve Buscemi).  Lincoln and Jordan soon discover that they are clones and escape the shelter to see what is on the outside and this is where the story takes off.

There were several things I liked about this movie.  First and foremost the movie was well cast.  Ewan McGregor is great, but I think Scarlett Johansson really stands out here and proves she could be a great star in action films if she chooses.  Steve Buscemi is also great as their friend, who is a at heart a little sleazy but is sympathetic and tries to help his friends.  The bad guys also deserve mention, Sean Bean was great as the villian with the God complex, and Djimon Hounsou as the hardened mercenary is also great.

The film is visually very impressive and invocative. The special effects are top notch which explains why the budget of this movie was about $120 million.  I especially liked the rocket cycle chase and the tricked out Cadillac.

I also like that the film is somewhat topical as it deals with a issue we hear a lot about these days: cloning.  The movie is talking about cloning taken to a (probably) illogical extreme, but at least it is trying to say something rather than just blowing things up for two hours. I found that very refreshing in a summer movie.

The film did have a few things that bugged me though.  First of all were the very frequent and intrusive product placements.  I know movie studios have to make money, but I want to watch a movie not a string of advertisements for 2 hours.

Second, the film borrows a little to heavily from previous films, especially ""The Matrix"" and ""Logan's Run.""  They had a great concept with this movie, why not try something new rather then retread stuff that we have all already seen?

Finally, there was one plot point that drove me nuts.  About three quarters of the way through a main character suddenly switches allegiance for the flimsiest of reasons.  This was a great villian and one of my favorite characters. There seemed absolutely no purpose to this plot twist and to be honest my first impression was this was pure political correctness.

In the end I still recommend this film for the great performances by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, the great action and special effects and because the movie tries to say something.",1142985600,2,3334,4.542713567839196

I don't know why, but it just didn't appeal to me on some level.  Well...I finally sat down and watched it and was very pleasantly surprised by what it had to offer.

In the beginning we get a view of life in the undeground as we follow Lincoln Six-Echo(Ewan McGregor) around the facility and see what strange Utopian life is all about.  He's been having bad dreams about going to The Island, a chance of a lifetime won through the daily lottery.  He's not just another happy little worker bee, content to take things as they are given with no questions asked.  Why white clothes?  Why no color?  Where do the tubes go?  So many questions and very few answers until, by mistake, he stumbles upon a moth in one of the inaccessable areas of the compound.  A moth?  But everything supposedly died in the Contamination of the surface world.  What's going on?  He confides his findings to Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johanssen)around the same time that she wins the lottery and is being swept away to the luxurious Island.  Right?  Wrong.  There is no Island.  Lincoln discovers the truth when he climbs up a ventilation shaft and reaches the surface.

You can find out the rest of the twist and turns when you watch the movie, because I don't like to spoil things.  Trust me, you want to watch The Island.  It's visually stunning and thrilling and filled with action and enlightenment.  One of the better movies to come along in a while.  Not the usual Hollywood brain-dead movie mishmash.

849766,5,6304328583,"_The Island_ is a movie about a totalitarian system enslaving a group of clones.  This movie touches on many issues which face us in this very day and age.  To say nothing of the gross immorality of human cloning and the unethical disposal of human genetic material (very much endowed with the very breath of life from the Creator), this movie also has much to say about totalitarian forms of government.  In the movie, the clones live in a closed-in society ruled by their masters who have created a situation that pretty much robs life of all meaning.  However, like the crass materialistic culture we live in today which refuses to recognize the sanctity of unborn life, the society in _The Island_ does not recognize the sanctity of the life of the clones.  These clones are herded like cattle, eventually to serve as the unwitting organ donors for their ultra-rich owners.  When the time comes for one of the clones to ""win the lottery"", they are taken to up to the surface world and there are surgically operated upon against their will, often killed in the process.  The movie features two clones who manage to somehow miraculously discover that they are clones and to escape from this totalitarian dystopia.  They seek to liberate their fellow clones, but first they must find a means to notify their respective insurance policy holders of the true nature of their insurance policy.  However, along the way they encounter several snags which lead to an eventual confrontation with the owners of the cloning operation all under the auspices of the federal government.  This movie has much to say not only about the very unethical nature of human cloning but also about totalitarian systems in general.  It serves to signify precisely what the late Pope John Paul II meant when he referred to modern culture as a ""culture of death"".  May we heed this warning as we approach a truly brave new world which holds promise but also holds the potential for a total robbery of the sacredness of life!",1142208000,10,1999,4.77906976744186

Didn't have to be; in 2 hours, 20 minutes there could have been some fabulous interactions between the uneducated clones and the outside world.  Instead, its running, chasing, digital compositing and showing how much they let Michael Bay spend.

Speaking of Mr. Bay, his commentary shows he has no need to work on his self-confidence and its not very interesting.  Talking about one of the better scenes--the abandoned train station--he says ""I'm not gonna tell you where it is"".  Took exactly one click in Google to find out.

One thing Bay's right about is that it was difficult to market ""The Island"".  It forced them to tell you in the trailer, that there was no island so what else do you need to know?",1142208000,,845,4.519736842105263

For human beings to dwell

Polluted, dead and out of bounds

It's no more than a shell

Inside, a whole new world is formed

All sterile, white and clean

Utopia it seems to be,

Each day the same routine

But every week there is a draw

Around a central theme

The lucky winner's Island-bound

It's every person's dream

Then one day Lincoln Six wakes up

And finds he's lost a shoe

He's having dreams about a boat,

and even drowning too

The sensors say his diet's wrong

And cut back on his bacon

He meets the $exy Jordan Two

and something starts to waken

He starts to find out for himself

The truth behind the lies

No one sees he's out of bounds

Because he's in disguise

By accident he learns the truth

That shocks him to the core

He and Jordan fly the coop

And learn there's so much more

It seems the rich have found a way

To cheat Death while he's reaping

They buy insurance policies

And store them for safekeeping

This movie's full of gaping holes

Its plot's a slice of Swiss

and if you think a little bit

you'll find something's amiss

A mish mash of a dozen films

It's Product Placement Day!

849769,4,6304328583,"A Michael Bay film is never a quiet cerebral experience. One is not talking intellectual cinema, but Hollywood movie, big budget, corporate slick, and mass audience marketing. Thus, The Island can only be viewed from the position of what pleases the status quo. Although an intriguing premise opens the film -- an ocean setting, a suntanned beautiful couple (Scarlet Johanson and Ewan McGregor), and a big, faster than fast yacht in a turquoise pristine sea -- it is not a dream, it is a nightmare that haunts Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor), a troubled young man with a vivid memory his co-workers seem not to possess. What is his world, purpose, and reality in an over regulated existence is the setting of the facility where adults are worker bees in an institutional setting, and white, high key lighting bathes everyone in a literal aura. The daily routine is only broken by the chance of the lottery and dream to win a trip to ""the island -- nature's last pathogen-free zone.""

Lincoln has a friendly competitive interest in Jordan Two Delta (Johanson) but they can not touch nor would they seem likely to go further than a mere graze of the arm as all adults have a child like reasoning deficiency, including Lincoln. Proximity avoided, Lincoln question his situation, dreams, lack of food and clothing choices, and what exists beyond the confines of the institutional prison where he is monitored, tested, and continually observed.  The story of his growing curiosity and skills at deductive reasoning seem to be developing more in Lincoln and it will lead to his violating the parameters of the agnate world that culminates in a break for freedom by taking Jordan Two Delta with him.

The Island digresses to a car chase bang-bang, bad guy versus good guy extended romp through Los Angeles freeways, high-rise buildings, and the desert. The intriguing premise is quickly rushed to the too obvious ending, and a superior cast of McGregor, Johanson, Sean Bean, D'Jarmon Hinsou, and Steve Buccemi are wasted by the SFX, CGI, and over the top explosions. Blame director Michael Bays who makes a film for profit and profit only. Too bad it bombed in the theaters.  What a disappointment.  Audiences who are intent on purchasing the DVD will find only minimal added features and an all but monosyllabic narrative by the director. He has only himself to blame for the forgettable film of body replacement and military engineering for the priviledged few.  Rental fare only.",1141862400,,2471,4.927884615384615

849772,3,6304328583,"This is a pretty entertaining movie.  I think it will make some who are all for cloning and its attendant technologies a bit squeamish, but that is part of its purpose, just as the 1978 movie ""Coma"" raised similar questions for transplants.  The movie has basically two very different parts.  One is a kind of scifi mood piece and the other is an extremely hyper (even preposterous) action flick.  Does it work?  Well, as I say, I found it enjoyable, but not enlightening.

If you think of the movie as opening with a kind of 1984 - Brave New World that then transitions with Coma and then finishes with an adrenaline fueled Logan's Run, well, that is about it.  It is well done for what it is and has a couple of touching moments.  However, they are hard to feel because they are small cupfuls within barrels of crashbangboom.

So, if you just enjoy it for what it is and, sad to say, don't think too much, you can have fun with this movie.",1141516800,2,941,4.362068965517241
849862,3,6304328583,"That's how I end up feeling about this film. What I liked about it was firstly the idea. It begins with a strong sci-fi premise, the sort of warping of a future society that might not actually be that unrealistic considering our developing technologies. Also, I'm fans of both Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. They're both talented actors with the capacity to pull off complex characters.

But that's not really what they're asked to do here. I agree with the earlier reviewer that said that once the main character witnesses what happens to a clone and escapes from the compound there's no mystery anymore. Usually, a good sci-fi film will keep you guessing throughout. That doesn't happen here. Part way through it shifts gears, sort of leaving behind the true premise and setting out on a series of incredible chase scenes. I'm sure many people won't mind, but anyone looking for serious sci-fi will be somewhat unhappy with this one.

All that action, by the way, does require some serious sillyness. For example, Steve Buscemi's character is suppose to work in this major hightech, multi-billion dollar illegal and sketchy enterprise. He's privy to information that could bring down the entire company, and yet he lives off sight with a fast-talking babe, hangs out in biker bars and is generally the kind of lovable sort of low life that Buscemi is so good at. Does that make sense, though? If this is such a big company that has so much invested in an illegal operation that the outside world absolutely can never find out about... Well, I'm inclined to believe they'd keep the employees on sight, at the very least. This movie doesn't deal with that, however, because the Buscemi character serves a host of convenient purposes.

There are many moments that made my eyes roll. But I know, I know... It's entertainment. No harm done. I just wish the director had spent more time on the moral complexity of the issues and had a few less explosions and car wrecks.",1141516800,2,1973,4.797058823529412

Overall: VERY GOOD!",1141430400,,273,4.48
849864,3,6304328583,"Let me start by saying that this movie has a very interesting premise.  The science of cloning and all the ethical questions surrounding it have been in much debate as of late, and this movie poses some interesting hypotheses for us to consider.

The theme is nothing new: Those who meddle in cloning humans, and subjugating their lives as lesser beings to a supposed higher purpose are treading in the dangerous waters of ""playing God"".  The movie is an expose of the business of cloning --- what if it was possible to pay money to have an exact copy, all working parts included, manufactured and be ready to provide us with whatever replacement parts that we need?  The movie takes us to the future, and shows us, with some high hyberboles, just how that might work.  In doing so it makes some huge suppositions, namely that in order to clone parts of a human being, it must be cloned as a whole, and that a life must be destroyed in order to serve its purpose, even though there's plenty of real life evidence in the scientific world that all these things need not be necessarily true.  To that end, all the spins on this business ideas are essentially negative in this film.  As our main character clone discovers the true purpose of his existence, the rest of the movie focuses on how he brings down the whole enterprise of human cloning.

Unfortunately for a serious sci-fi fan like me, I find the film loses much of its excitement after the revelation of the secrets of ""The Island"".  After Ewan McGregor's character witnesses the destruction of one his co-clones for the first time, which makes the whole storyline clear to the viewer, there's no more mystery left in the rest of the film.  Mid-way through the film I started getting bored, because I realized that the movie had been reduced to mere stylishly-shot fight scenes and car chases.  While I think the action sequences were nicely put together as a collage of real-life shots and CGI, the magic of a captivating storyline was gone.  Everything just became very linear, and very predictable.

We have the pleasure of getting a capable cast in this movie, including Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johanssen and Sean Bean.  However, the action oriented script does not call for much character development, so they were not given much to work with.  It's quite superficial on that level.  Another thing that truly annoyed me was the product placements.  I understand that filmmaking is a business, but it's blatant to have shots of corporate products from the likes of Apple, Puma, Nokia and GM (General Motors practically own this movie) thrown into every shot, even after people have each paid $10 to see this in a theatre.  Add to that the polished color treatment, costumes, sets of the movie, it almost has that consistency of a TV commercial.",1140998400,3,2806,4.7268993839835725

Once our heros find out the truth they become expendable and must be put out of the way. Even the president has a clone {It's called an insurance policy} that's no surprise to me. Well anyway the the story gets off to a slow start but picks up about 45 mins into the film. And continues fast and furious all the way to the end. With our heros being chase and pursued not only by the people of Merrick but the police as well and a mercenarie by the name of Albert Laurent {played by Ojlmon Hounson} This film gives us 2 hours and 16 mins of action and suspense.

 Don't get me wrong, ""The Island"" is not a terrible movie - it just isn't great. In fact, I knew that I had to write the review immediately or I would forget about it- it is that forgettable.

I am also a little confused on why the movie was not ""Great"". Certainly the theme and the plot were very interesting - and it is worth watching for these alone.

849939,5,6304328583,"Loved it.

Ewan McGregor (Star Wars) and Scarlott Johansson (Girl w/ a Pearl Earring) were wonderful. Steve Buscemi (Armageddon) is always a welcome sight, love him. A small apearance of Michael Clark Duncan (The Green Mile) as a poor bloke that won the Island trip, was super.

In the future, the world destroyed by contaminates, everyone lives in this bio-dome enclosed world. There are rules, everyone is controlled to the max, all wearing white, no dating, body functions all monitored, food distributed and everything monitored. Everyone must be calm, happy, and don't ask questions. The only goal is to be chosen, by lottery, to go to the Island. When you win, and get to go, that is the ultimate - oh boy!!

But, our boy, Lincoln, (McGregor) starts to question. Where do the tubes go? Who folds my laundry? And what of the dreams? He ventures into forbidden areas and finds things he wasn't meant to find. I'm not going to give away anymore, you have to see it!

Personally, I don't even read the back of a DVD before watching, as I don't want to know anything ahead of time, when I watch a movie. I like to be surprised. So should you.

This film is fun, full of adventure, and tension, suspense, thrills, and rooting for the pair of them to make it out alive.

Good for kids over 14, I'd say. Not for little kids. Scary, a little, but, I wouldn't want small kids to see.  And I sure wouldn't want to have to explain anything to anyone I was watching it with.

849940,2,6304328583,"Imagine that Universal Pictures only included the non-action scenes from this movie on the DVD.  Wouldn't that be fraud?  After all, customers buying the DVD expect (and deserve) to get the same visual and sound material that was shown in the theaters, don't they?

Well, it's hard to believe that a company, which continuously lectures us on what a ""criminal act"" copying movies is, would have the gall to flog this movie in Canada on DVD with Dolby Digital 2.0 english only and not include DD5.1 english or DTS at all! They must figure that Canadian customers don't deserve to be treated honestly.  Or maybe they're hoping to release it later with the ""real sound encoding"" included and call it the ""gold edition"" or some other cute and meaningless name.

Universal initially labelled the packages as having ""DD5.1 english"" but the DVD itself doesn't, so they sent ""Dolby 2.0"" stickers out to Best Buy and other retailers and had them cover up the crime.  But, when the package is opened the case still reads DD5.1.

Now even all the rental places in Canada only have the version with Dolby2.0 english and anyone desperate to hear the ""Authentic Sound Encoding"" has to buy off Amazon in the U.S.A., or try to catch it on PPV satellite.

It's probable that some unbelieveably pathetic VP at Universal didn't have the guts to do the right thing. Which would be to recall those DVD's and reissue them with both the DD5.1 english version and the DTS version.

I gave it a ""3"" because the beginning promises to be interesting because the viewer does not know what is going on yet.

The 2nd half of the movie is filled with endless chase scenes, cars, people and helicopters all over the place disintegrating and bursting into flames.

849945,3,6304328583,"As my title states the film brought me back to an older sci-fi style as it reminded me of Logans Run a little.  Escaping from a confined world can always be interesting, especially with the new theme of cloning. Being that were on the actual cusp of moral and ethical issues involving cloning, this touched it good. Plus, clonings great sci-fi.
  The trailer looked good, then I heard and read nothing but bad things about it and unfortunately bought into it. Months later I read a review in Sound and Vision that really ignited my interest. It turned out to be a worthwhile watch. There are some stupid scenes, but in total, the whole idea conceived and placed neatly in a film did work. The acting was not nearly as bad as was claimed. Granted its not acadamy award acting, but it rolled with the storyline.
  A cloning world where people are birthed as adults to benefit the vain rich had all the weird complexities necessary to keep a sci-fi buffs eyes fixed on the screen. The movie also worked by giving the viewer a feeling of emptiness about the clones lives. Djimon Hounsou was on the money as the man hired to catch the clones while his mind questioned the big picture of things.
  One great line was when Hounsou says,  ""I've done alot of things I'm not proud of....when did you get into the business of killing people.""
  If you like futuristic scenery and a good sci-fi chase this is your ticket. It's not a monumental film but it does well with what this genre of moviemaking is intended to do.

At one point, a man even marvels that his clone has the same fingerprints.  (Just for the record, a full-blown clone would be the genetic equivalent of an identical twin:  same DNA, but not same fingerprints.  Even identical twins have distinct features.)

That said, it was definitely an exciting story, even if it presented a highly implausible dystopia.  I had trouble believing that people would want to create a clone of themselves for the sake of organ harvest, and impossible to believe that anyone would want to create a clone so they could use it as a gestational receptacle (we mothers are odd that way...we actually enjoy feeling life growing within our wombs).

And now, onto the topic of life.  I don't know if it was intentional or accidental, but this movie unabashedly embraces life, and condemns the destruction of one life for the benefit or convenience of another life.  Much as the antagonists try to rationalize clones as ""product"" that can be harvested or used or destroyed as their ""owners"" wish, the clones fight for their lives and seek to rescue all the other clones, knowing that decency and humanity compell them to do so.  A violent, action-packed, sci-fi flick is an awfully strange place to find such a life-affirming message, but it was nonetheless most welcome.",1138665600,3,1428,4.839506172839506

The entire film blends into one long car chase scene with crashes, explosions, and little else. The dialog is silly and the plot becomes more contrived as we go along.

The basic premise is that an ""evil corporation"" grows clones for these evil rich people to provide organs for evil rich people as they need them. We see a large room with hundreds of clones being grown on tables. But, for some reason, the clones are ""awakened"" and then kept in a fictional society, entirely apart from the real world? Why the clones are not simply kept in an incubative state, we are not told. Eventually one of the clones, our hero,  finds out the truth and, after much car chasing, many explosions, and too much booming base music, kills his evil double and brings down the evil corporation single-handedly.

849998,1,6304328583,"At one time, Brad Pitt was attached with this film. Boy was he lucky he bailed on it.

The Island is a really really badly done sci fi flick that would have you believe it is unique and new. It isn't. It is a very thinly (and poorly) veiled remake of Logan's Run (from the 1970's).

The Island borrows heavily from films such as The Matrix (didn't you think the clones were houses similarly to the people under control by the Matrix?), Minority Report (that piss poor film starring The Scientologist), and then completely steals huge chunks from Logan's Run.

The years is 2014 and Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen are perky little citizens of a utopian society in which the citizens have no independent thought. Suddenly McGregor gets it in his head that he's going to go out on his own. Why? He has bad dreams (but aren't these the same dreams everyone else is having? Yes. Later,we're even shown that the others have these same ""memories"" implants).

He sneaks away and discovers that his civilization's life is all a big lie and that they are nothing more than the parts department for the rich and wealthy who can afford to have clones created for use as spares for when they are injured or dying.

The rest is a chase film wherein the bad guys try to keep the clones from blowing the whistle.

If you've ever seen Logan's Run, you'll remember all of this as well. However, Logan's Run did it far better - and surprisingly with better special effects.

The mere premise of this film is silly and feeds into the mentality of the mindless millions of television viewers whose salacious appetite for Jerry Springer-like reality has given television networks latitude to further dumb down the television audience. Ooooooo, what if it really happened? Ooooooo what if I ran into my clone?

The Island tells us that the rich are evil and should be stopped. Jerry Springer's core audience will eat that idea up.

At least in Logan's Run, the blame was given to all society for being such sheep and believing whatever was being told to them.

Are the rich evil for being wealthy and should they thus be punished or are those who want others to tell them what to think and do to blame for their lot in life? I think that's the difference between The Island and Logan's Run.

I'll take the message from Logan's Run any day of the week over that of The Island. At least it means that I'm not so stupid that I'll do whatever someone else tells me to do.

Don't bother.",1138579200,13,2465,4.527027027027027
849999,5,6304328583,"The Island, together with King Kong (my #1) and Serenity (struggling with The Island for #2 place), are my favorite movies of 2005. Each has left a profound impression on me. The only thing unimpressive about The Island was the title-and even that objection evaporated once the introduction sequences started rolling; for suddenly the apparently vapid title acquired context and meaning. But it wasn't the snazziest title they could have come up with to draw people into the theaters.

I'm not going to summarize the plot, since it's been discussed at length before. Instead, here are some points that need to me mentioned in order to do the film justice.

The Island, if one feels bound to refer to other movies, is basically Logan's Run meeting Bladerunner. It asks some of the same questions; most significantly one of profound philosophical import: how do you define a 'human being'?

[Sidebar: The often-mentioned Gattaca, on the other hand-and I'm pointing this out this for the benefit of those reviewers still struggling with comprehension of the fundamental difference between the movies-asked if the value of human beings depends on their genetic makeup; just like one might ask if a handicapped person is of equal value as one who isn't.]

Should a cloned ('replicated', 'copied') but conscious human being be accorded the same rights as one created and brought into this world in a more conventional manner? What is consciousness anyway? How do you detect it?

How far will human beings go to preserve their lives? (There's a truly disturbing part in Michael Bay's commentary on the DVD regarding this. Truth apparently is even more sickening than the occasionally quite troubling fiction of The Island.)

The Island deals with these issues in all seriousness; but not in a pretentious or 'arty' manner, or with the ponderous gravitas that might have eventuated in the hands of a 'serious' director. It also answers them; at least as much as it is possible-for, after all, who _can_ say what 'consciousness' actually 'is'? We all _know_ what it is, but try to _define_ it and you're instantly stepping on philosophical quicksand.

All this is accomplished in the context for an 'action' movie, and one by Michael Bay at that. That instantly gets a lot of folks' hackles up; for Michael Bay can't possibly make a movie with depth, right? Well, think again, for this one is. An object lesson, if we need one, to teach us that not every action film has to be a one-dimensional Tom Cruise or Will Smith vehicle. The Island strikes an exquisite balance between the relief provided by humor and the physical-ness of some very well done action, moments of reflection, and a multi-layered plot with lots of hidden meanings and question marks, as well as a satisfying denouement.

Above all-and unlike Gattaca, which was a very 'self centered' movie; with the protagonist really only interested in himself and his own plans and tribulations-The Island ultimately went beyond that and toward displaying a sense of social responsibility. One of the most touching moments of the movie occurs when Lincoln and Jordan spin dreams of what they would like to do, and how they could just go far away and live like 'real people'; and then he says ""...but after..."", meaning after having tried to help ""all those people we left behind"", who are about to be destroyed (well, 'killed' or 'murdered' would be more appropriate) as their makers try to 'start over' a new generation of clones with less troublesome predilections.

The decision to risk their future for the sake of their fellow clones, is the ultimate proof of Lincoln's and Jordan's humanity; and in the process they help to redeem the one who has hunted them relentlessly, and who rediscovers his own humanity as a result of his interaction with them.

One issue has raised justifiable questions: how did the clones 'know' all these things they knew? Or, how did not just they, but apparently another whole lot, become infected with apparently spontaneously-generated memories of their 'sponsors', that is the people they were cloned from?

One possible answer is that memories are encoded in the DNA of a person-but that doesn't make much sense. There is nothing to suggest in current scientific research that this is either possible or that it happens. Another theory-and this is where 'speculation' enters the fray-is that (slightly extending theories such as those developed by the likes of Rupert Sheldrake or Roger Penrose) people with identical genetic makeup have a 'connection' that goes beyond mere genetics; that they are 'linked' (telepathically?) in some way. Maybe that's how their 'memories' seemed to have 'grown' spontaneously over the lifetimes of the clones. Maybe that's also why, in some ways, the clones-and especially Lincoln-seemed to have acquired certain characteristics of their 'sponsors'.

I don't know and neither did the God-potentate Merrick, who was highly and unpleasantly surprised by this turn of events; though for a few moments he appeared to be genuinely stimulated by the notion, until he realized that it was interfering with his carefully laid-out plans and DOD funding. He never found the explanation, before he died at the hands of one of his creations.

So, is there a suggestion here that there's more to life and humanity and the mind and every-damn-thing than is currently accepted by science? I know some people aren't comfortable with that notion, and, being an atheist myself, I'm not bringing God into this either-but is the notion that we haven't figured out the fundamentals of 'human nature' really so preposterous? Is it unreasonable for a movie, and especially one so unashamedly 'entertainment', to suggest that maybe we don't know everything, and that our ignorance, combined with the delusions of omniscience in some, is likely to come and bite us in the butt?

I think not. This theme, by the way, is also picked up in that other cinematographic gem, Serenity, though from a slightly different angle.

The Island's score by Steve Jablonsky is impressive and moving; showing (like Klaus Badelt's did for Pirates of the Caribbean) a close connection to Hans Zimmer, who may be the greatest and most influential film-score composer working today.

Bottom line and in two words: great flick. Highly recommended for those who like to be entertained and think at the same time. The rest of you, depending on your inclinations, either go watch some DAMN (Deep-And-Meaningful-Nothing) movie instead, or spend quality time with and waste money on vapid Mission Impossible flicks (or anything by and with Tom Cruise, except possibly The Last Samurai) or maybe the silly, though mildly entertaining, I, Robot.

The Island DVD is not exactly loaded with 'extras' (no space on a single DVD with a 2 hr movie for much extra stuff anyway); but I don't feel that, unless there's another cut of this movie, or unless they put in significant background material on cloning and associated issues, there's actually much more to add to what is a very complete film. Besides, personally I'm not really all that interested in the details of shooting 'action', and what there is seems more than enough. Maybe something about Steve Jablonsky might be nice, too. But basically I'm cool with the DVD as it is.

850002,5,6304328583,"I watched this film twice just to take in all the really cool visuals Michael Bay created.

The film first reminded me of ""Gattaca"" from 1997 which I really liked and have seen nothing that approaced that film since.

The concept of this film, ""The Island"", is a bit tough to grasp even half way through though it all comes together soon enough. Both actors were not fantastic but they are what drew me to the film. I cannot stop looking at Scarlet Johansson no matter what and after ""Trainspotting"" Ewan McGregor is top notch for me in almost anything he has done.

The director does a good job at keeping the real secret of The Island from the audience for just the right amount of time. All of a sudden it dawns on you. I'll say no more cause that secret is the core of the film.

On second viewing it struck me how much action there really is in this film. I mean it made me think of the last ""Terminator"" film in it's almost constant action sequences.

You may wonder what the heck it's all about from the openeing credit roll through the first 10 minutes but hang in there cause it is done very well.

Incidently, the boat you see in the opening is a huge mind blower of a craft. You don't get to see much of it but I saw enough to know it's the same boat that I have a PowerPoint presentation of from stem to stern and it's the coolest boat you will ever see!

850003,4,6304328583,"It isn't often that you find a movie that is purely science fiction.  But here is one of them.  This is basically Logan's Run with 21st century special effects.

I was warned by a lot of people to avoid this movie.  But I figured I'd give it a shot on a rental.  And I'm really glad I did as I found this to be a great science fiction find.  If you like technology driven science fiction then this movie is most definitely for you.

The acting is great, particularly from Ewan McGregor who gets to play two roles in this movie.  The story has some holes and questions left open but I actually found it to cover the bases better than most other sci-fi movies.  If you are into explosions, then this movie will most definitely supply what you are looking for.

The best thing about this movie is the story and plot.  It does a wonderful job of creating a futuristic ""world"" that is both new and yet still familiar.  The story deals with a topic that is under much debate, which is cloning.  While this will in no way convince anybody one way or another (except the extremely gullible), it is still interesting to look at cloning as presented by this movie.

My only disappointment in this movie was a completely unnecessary love scene between Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson.  Unnecessary because it didn't add to the story, but even worst, it was contradictory to what we knew about the characters.  It served as nothing more than a distraction from the movie.",1138233600,,1464,4.488636363636363

As a fan of both Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johansen, I decided to pick it up at the local Blockbuster when there was nothing else to rent.  This movie is fantastic.  While there is the occasional explosion and the idea is based on a future where people can clone themselves, etc., this isn't some far flung, crazily imagined futuristic movie.  Quite simply, the movie features a solid story with good acting and a well developed plot.  This is definately worth renting.  Beware the lack of special features though, they'll probably just release a two disc edition in six months that has all of the special features one would expect.",1137974400,3,741,4.661538461538462
850044,4,6304328583,"After watching The Island, I had the feeling that somewhere director Michael Bay and the writers had a cookbook.  Following the instructions, they took the ingredients - a bunch of old movies - half-baked them and came up with a confection that should be awful but actually is decent, although not very nutritious.

The Island takes place in a near-future world where a biotech company clones wealthy people so the customers can have new organs available when needed.  The clones are developed as adults and still require intellectual stimulation to maintain viability.  As a result, the clones live a regimented life in a secret city, laboring under the belief that the rest of the world is contaminated.  Occasionally, a clone wins the lottery that allows them to go to the Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth; in reality, the excursion is merely to an operating room where they are cut up and their organs gathered.

Ewan MacGregor plays Lincoln, a clone who has begun to question what is going on around him.  Along with Scarlett Johannsen's Jordan, they escape to the real world, with all sorts of paramilitary folk chasing them.  Thus we go from sci-fi to standard action flick:  lots of chases, gunfire and explosions.  In other words, while the first part of this movie may be thought-provoking, the second half is turn-off-your-brain time.  Not that that's bad.

The most obvious influence on this movie is Logan's Run (especially the end), but there are other clear influences including THX 1138, Blade Runner, Minority Report and even Return of the Jedi (with a motorcycle chase scene).  So, this may not be the most original of movies, but somehow it works.  MacGregor and Johannsen are skillful enough to make us care about their characters, and when that happens, most of the rest falls into place.",1137888000,,1823,4.934426229508197

850046,3,6304328583,"This movie takes place in 2019.  It is similar to those ""near future"" science fiction movies of the 1970's, like Logan's Run, THX 1138 and Soylent Green.  The characters even wear those white jumpsuits and live in a closed society.

For some reason, this movie is not advertised as a science fiction movie and the DVD case makes it appear as though the movie takes place in recent times.  Maybe they thought the white jumpsuits would turn people off.

The beginning and end of this movie is just like Logan's Run.  There is the mysterious society.  There is the character trying to escape.  There is the end scene where everyone walks comes out from the underground city and walks out into the open.

The middle of the movie is just like Minority report where the heroes are involved in a long chase scene while they try to discover what is really happening.

The movie really misses out in the middle with the continuous action scenes.  It could have been much better if they explored the ""fish out of water"" aspects of the story.  It is really a major part of the story as the two heroes discover a new world.  But, those issues are barely covered.

The action scenes are fairly good, but not great.  You get the typcial, over the top, high wire acts.  Like most action movies, there is the scene where the heroes almost fall off a huge structure, and one character is hanging in mid air, with only hand of the other character preventing a nasty fall.  How many times have we already seen that?

The action scenes don't quite match up with some of the best, like in the Star Wars movies.  They are kind of blurred, and the editing is bad, so the scene quickly jumps from one angle to the next.  You can never quite understand what is exactly happening.  Compare the space motorcycle scenes in this movie to those in Return of the Jedi.

This movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes.  You would think with that amount of time, they could explore more about the heroes reaction to their new world and still have plenty of time for action.

The only extra on the DVD is a documentary on how the action scenes were done.  To me, if you have seen one ""making of"" documentary, you have seen them all.  We all know about green screens, f/x and stunt men.",1137801600,2,2241,4.418092909535452
850047,3,6304328583,"It's interesting to look at what ""The Island"", the latest in reviled hitmaker Michael Bay's big budget action extravaganzas, could've been. This could've been a masterpiece, as it has great potential and a top notch cast. Unfortunately, in many ways it falls under the trap many of Bay's films often fall under, and that is the film's plot gets lost in a sea of explosions, car chases and whatnot. However, this film manages to stay afloat much sturdier than Bay's previous efforts, and while not his best work (""The Rock"" will forever hold that position), it's definitely one of his better efforts.

Lincoln (Ewan MacGregor) is one of many people living in an isolated compound somewhere in the United States. He questions his surroundings (namely the actions of his mysterious boss, played by Sean Bean), but is overall satisfied with his environment. He befriends the beautiful Jordan (Scarlett Johansson, my current celebrity crush), who wins a trip to the so called ""island"", where people living in the compound are supposedly sent to live their lives in a beautiful utopia. In reality, they are just sent to another part of the facility to be hacked up and have parts of them inserted into other people. Why, you ask? Because they're clones, insurance policies if you will. When ever their owner gets sick, they go to their clone for a liver, a heart, or whatever. Lincoln learns this, but not without help from our old friend Steve Buscemi. He rescues Jordan from her terrible fate, and the two escape from the compound and try to save their friends. Of course, the owners of the place want them dead, so naturally a bunch of henchman are sent on their trail. Lincoln runs into his owner, a Scottish vehicular expert, and from here on in, the film gets lost in the Bay formula.

Despite a number of flaws, ""The Island"" manages to emerge as an overall decent effort. It does indeed borrow ideas from films such as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Logan's Run"", but unless you're really true fans of those movies you can't really tell where exactly the films are ripped off.

The film's biggest plus are its two stars, namely Scarlett, who joins Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley and Rachel McAdams as one of the only actresses working today who can pull off a worthwhile performance in just about anything. Ewan MacGregor also puts on a satisfactory performance, and Sean Bean as always makes for a great villian. Steve Buscemi more or less plays Steve Buscemi, not that I mind, because I love Steve Buscemi in just about everything. My one big complaint is that Michael Clarke Duncan is essentially wasted in an extremely bit part that could've gone to any random actor. Djimon Hounsou doesn't fare much better as one of the compound's guards looking for Lincoln and Jordan.

Overall, despite its flaws, ""The Island"" is a watchable movie that is a good film to kill time. It's definitely one of Bay's better films, which is saying something.",1137715200,,2934,4.803960396039604
850048,4,6304328583,"First of all, the island reminds me of The Giver by Lois Lowry and Aeon Flux.

It is the year 2019...

When the movie starts they show you a beautiful tropical island and there's a soothing voice in the background letting you know this is the place to be. ""You've been chosen... you're special."" You eventually find out that when you go to the island it really means you'll be ""Sleeping with the Fishes."" The island is when you are ready to die because everyone in this sterile looking institution is a clone. This is where I found a similarity with the Lowry book. In the book I think they call it ""desensitizing"" or ""released"" I can't remember. In the movie when you're ready to die they call it ""The Island."" People in the outside world or the ""real world"" pay big buck to this company where they have given you life in order to use you for body parts so that the people in the ""real world"" can keep on living. When they market ""The Island"" as a tropical retreat and make it sound unbelieveably good, everyone is willing to go. Thus, ""The Island"" gives these people a sense of hope. How you get to the island is based on a lottery, when your number is up that's when you're ready to go.

This movie shows you what happens when clones don't know they're clones and they don't have a desire to die. It really deals with the moral and ethical dilemnas with cloning for our own personal use. Yes, of course, we'll live longer but, at what price? Our clone is a ""human"" and therefore, are they ready to die without their own consent?

Lincoln (Ewan Mcgregor)is different from all the other clones, because he actually questions his existence. He questions his life. What is everyone's purpose in this institution? He's also having memories from his ""sponsor"" or the original copy of himself. This is strange indeed, because everyone in the institution has memories imprinted in their brains with the help of software. Global contamination gives them fear and keeps them inside, much like the Lowry book where the community had fear from traveling astray and never left. I've heard a lot of people compare Aeon Flux to this movie, but remember that story of Aeon Flux came before this movie in the 90's. So, ""The Island"" was probably developed from the Aeon Flux story, not the other way around.

Steve Buscemi, McCord, the janitor in the movie works in this institution but is from the ""outside/real world."" When Lincoln and Jordan(Scarlett Johansson)escape, they meet up with the janitor so that he can help them. The funniest thing Buscemi says is this ""Excuse me, Ms. I'm So Smart... I can't wait to go to the island."" Hahahaha... When they're in the city it looks extremely futuristic ala ""5th-Element."" In 2019 I don't think we'll advance to the point where we'll see flying/hoovering trains, buses, or cars. But alas, this is a movie.

Keep in mind that these are clones, so they don't know much about the real world. They don't have street smarts where they should know any better and in fact, they don't even have common sense for that matter. They see a rattlesnake, you and I would've flinched at the sight of it, they don't flinch, they try to touch the darn thing. Also, you and I would've trashed our ID bracelets a long time ago, what do they do? They keep them on, yes this means they are being tracked by the very people they are running away from.

Lastly, there's an African-American man who works for the main creator of the clone company. He says something that's very interesting. He says something like this: ""We belonged to the Okanawa tribe, where we were branded to let us know that we're less than human."" Our clones are branded along with the bracelet. He questions the creator of this knowledge and the creator in turn says, ""I have found the Holy Grail of Science. They aren't human, they have no souls.""

In short, if you're willing to look at Scarlett Johansson clothed in material from neck to toe then you'll want to watch it. If you're also willing to sit through a movie whose plot has been duplicated before, then go ahead. Let me tell you, it was entertaining enough where I laughed when Buscemi came out with the jokes. Also, it was entertaining to watch cars crash and blow up. It was a good movie, not something I'd watch again, but if you're into this sort of thing then by all means watch it!",1137715200,,4332,4.55198973042362

Ewan and Scarlett are Lincoln and Jordan in a futuristic time, the place they live in has no children and they all believe that from the contained area they live in that the world outside has been contaminated and they are the last of the human species alive. They wake up fully adult believing to be saved from the horrors of the world and live and work for this 'place'. Then if they're lucky they win the daily lottery and get a trip to the beautiful island where life is wonderful all the time. However, 'the people in black' control when they get up, what they eat, what work they do, and there is no physical contact between opposite sexes. Hmmmmmm....

Lincoln, Ewan's character begins to question these things and finds a way to see more than this perfect place and challenges their 'boss's' propaganda. From then it's a fast actiony chase that had me rooting for him and Jordan until the end. And I have to say it was a fantastic ride. This is one I put in my very limited collection of movies.

Ewan as always was phemoninal. Scarlett who I didn't really know, I fell in love with as an actress, was spectacular, the supporting cast was amazing and even though you know what's going on after a while you are truly cheering for the two of them.

850117,4,6304328583,"The Island is a curious hybrid of intriguing sci-fi premise and over-the-top action sequences. Nevertheless, it manages to provide adrenaline-charged entertainment for two hours.

The film, set in the not-too-distant future, makes yet another pessimistic forecast: Humans have become obsessed with living forever -- in perfect, youthful bodies. And human cloning has made this possible for those who can afford the $5 million price tag to order a custom set of spare parts.

These clones are raised in a special facility and brainwashed to believe they are survivors of an apocalypse that made the outside world uninhabitable. It is a sterile environment of concrete, glass and steel, where pesky human traits such as curiosity and sexuality are kept strictly in check. Their one hope is to win a lottery to go the ""the Island,"" the Earth's ""only pathogen-free zone.""

Discovering the gruesome truth about the lottery is a clone named Lincoln Six-Echo, played appealingly by Ewan McGregor. When his best friend, gorgeous Jordan Two-Delta (the wonderful Scarlett Johansson) is chosen to go to the Island, they break out of the facility.

That doesn't sit well with the director, Merrick, who has told his clients that the clones are kept in a vegetative state and never feel human emotions (like, say, pain and fear). Sean Bean (National Treasure) is play's well once again, as the odiously heartless director of the obscenely profitable human-parts factory. He dispatches a squad of mercenaries to get rid of the problem.

And that's where the action sequences kick into overdrive. Director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Armageddon) employs his trademark hyperbolic style, with ear-shattering sound, choppy jump-cuts, and vehicles flying, flipping and crashing everywhere, including through glass buildings.

The plot also is riddled with action-film cliches, including weapons placed conveniently within reach, elevators that open and close just in time, characters who provide critical aid but are quickly dispatched, and so on. And the premise itself doesn't hold up very well under scrutiny. For instance, you have to buy the fact that hundreds of facility employees have no moral qualms about the fate of their charges.

Yet somehow, it still works -- due in large part to the stars. McGregor and Johansson completely sell their roles as the innocents who are thrust into the real world. A world where no one can be trusted, and hardened men are trying to kill them with high-tech weapons. They have no idea about things like cars, or credit cards, or sex -- but they're fast learners.

Complementing their performances is Djimon Hounsou (In America, Gladiator) as the lead mercenary who is just doing a job. But in the end, he, like the audience, comes to regard the clones more highly than the supposedly superior humans around them.",1136764800,,2833,5.183807439824945
850118,3,6304328583,"In ""1984,"" Orson Welles warned us of a future where a new world government controls the minds and actions of society. In ""The Island,"" society is limited to the confinements of a massive futuristic seclusion. The inhabitants are convinced that their society is the last pathogen free zone in the world, and that they are totally shielded from outside pollution. They are also convinced that they will each eventually be selected to go to a utopian vacation spot, known as The Island.

The inhabitants are selected through a lottery. Twice a day, everyone gathers around large television screens to find out who the lucky winner is. That person is taken away and never heard from again, but the other inhabitants never mention it. They are deceived into thinking that their lives are their own, when in fact they are someone else's property. A memory processing chip is inserted into each of their brains, and all of the memories that these chips evoke are practically identical in each person. All of them wear the exact same uniforms and go through the same daily routines. They have no knowledge of the outside world, and no knowledge of the future that each of them has in store, probably because their intelligence is limited to that of a fifteen-year-old.

""The Island"" is one of those movies where characters look forward to a wonderful vacation and end up stranded at the airport. The Island itself bestows unspeakable horrors, because anyone chosen for the lottery undergoes their life purpose. That I will leave you to discover, but I will ask who manages to fund these kinds of projects. Surely a mammoth operation such as the skyscraper city can not go unchecked by the government, and since all of the people raised inside of it are used as ""insurance policies,"" who carries these jobs out? Nationwide? Blue Cross Blue Shield?

Just like in ""1984,"" there is a character who senses something wrong with the world he lives in, and in this case its Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor). He is able to question the nature of his clothing, his food, and his personal hygiene, and he is even able to consider his restricted feelings for Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet Johansson). The characters know that they are being overseen by Merrick (Sean Bean, in standard-issue villain form), the supervisor of their repetitive world. Merrick doesn't seem comfortable with Lincoln Six Echo's dreams, in which he is sailing on a boat in an effort to escape what he has been presented with his entire life. Lincoln Six Echo's relationship with Jordan Two Delta is also something that Merrick finds disturbing, because with their combined curiosities they can uncover the truth about The Island.

The two of them eventually do, and that is when the movie transcends into an enthralling hardcore action ride. For its entire second half, ""The Island"" is nothing more than a clumsy, unflinching mass of special effects and weak storytelling. When Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta manage to escape into the real world, Merrick sends out an army of associates to capture them, lead by the aggressive Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou). That is basically everything the movie is about. It is a chase with an unpolished dramatic undertone that is all too eager to cut back to the action, and its not as well done as it should be.

The two heroes are probably more heroic than we take them to be, and the villains are more daring than they should be. When a number of evil henchman are either killed or seriously wounded, wouldn't the authorities become a tad curious about where they came from? When police officers are killed, wouldn't the search to find the killers become a problem for Merrick's containment of his two subjects?

I suppose this is a movie best left to those who enjoy seeing high-tech action sequences. Director Michael Bay brings to ""The Island"" the same kind of loud obnoxiousness that he brought to ""Bad Boys II."" A superbly done car chase with giant boulders tumbling from the back of a truck and smashing into pursuers reminded me of a similar scene from the 2003 film. At least in this movie we are given the benefits of editing organization. ""The Island"" is well-mannered in its material and is so intent on thrills that its action sequences appear to be scheduled. This isn't really bad thing. Its just that explosions, crashes, and shoot-outs should have more cause than effect.

Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johansson are two capable actors who manage to snuggle into the material with great ease. Steve Buscemi succeeds in a small role as an inside man who works as a benefactor to Lincoln and Jordan after they escape the wrath of evil Merrick. After playing a backstabbing scumbag in ""National Treasure,"" Sean Bean has become the perfect typecast for villains, and in ""The Island,"" while hiding behind a thin pair of sinister-looking spectacles, he does what he does best.

This is certainly not a cinematic achievement for the ages, but considering the balance of the film's flaws and triumphs, ""The Island"" is sufficiently made. What the film's purpose is I have no idea, because at times it doesn't seem to have a brain in its skull. Whatever Bay wanted to accomplish he probably does (a summer blockbuster with special effects) and some will even point out that his ending is all-too drawn out and routine. But in a movie where technicalities are superior to the material, would you expect the ending to be a surprise when nothing else really is?

Rated PG-13; 136 minutes; Directed by Michael Bay",1136678400,,5512,4.836691410392365
850119,2,6304328583,"Yeah, when this movie first premiered this summer, I was excited.  For starters, it had Scarlett Johannson playing a lead action role, which I never have seen before.  And since I loved her in Lost in Translation, I wanted to see her again.

And two, that it was also being hailed by some critics as finally a ""good"" Michael Bay movie. And while I admit that there was some crazy car chases, helicopters and flashy motercycles, and that Scarlett did look good in a skin tight suit , all that flash sadly made me fall once again for a Michael Bay movie. (The first was Armegeddon. Boy, am I glad that I stayed away from Pearl Harbor - even though half of that movie was actually good).

You know, it must be something about his movie trailors, because his movie trailors often make Bay's utter garbage look like pure gold.

Now if you looking for a late night action flick with nothing better to do and no DVD's in your DVD case, this popcorn flick may hold you. The same high adrenaline pumping music, the same quick cuts, mangled car chases, spectacular lighting and sophisticated CG in every Bay movie will probably lead to that hold. However, what I don't understand is why Michael Bay can't right a good storyline or good dialogue.

I mean, George Lucas writes better dialogue than this.

With a futurisic plot setting along the lines of THX, Logan's Run, Gataca, and other sci-fi movies dealing with clones, what could have been an interesting premise certainly falters at the starting gate with a futuristic setting of Los Angles (fully equiped with hover machines and holograms) starting in the year 2016.

*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*

Then what bothered me is that Bay tries to bring humanity into this boring sci-fi, with visual scenes eerily remeniscent of the gas chambers from Nazi Germany, and a African character (played by Hounsou) who sympathetically sides with Johanson's character out of his own knowledge for what it feels like to be ""branded"".  Man, I'm telling you, Michael Bay is just grabbing for straws.

There is even a sexist comment from Buscemi who explains to the newly espaced clones first day in ""civilization"", that there is one common suggestion, ""...that women shouldn't hold the credit card.""

*MINOR SPOILER ALERT END*

On top of things, the dialogue is weak. Ewan McGregor does most of the speaking in this movie. Most of the movie portrays scenes of the two main characters running , all the while (somehow) knowing how to drive fast cars and shoot guns even though they have never experienced the outside world before.

Ugh, and any sexy close up shots of Scarlett are missing. At least that would have made this 2 hour and 11 min. movie more bearable to watch (sorry ladies). But like a rollercoaster ride which you didn't want to get on, but was tricked in to getting on anyway, you will have to wait until this ride is over to get off. That's beacuse the plot was so flawed, that I resisted my better judgement of going to sleep and keept watching just to see how this movie would turn out (it does get slightly better in the end).

Let's just say this: It's viewable, and is why I gave it 2 stars. But, rent this movie. Better yet, watch it in on cable. However, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.

All the actions scenes are your basic Michael Bay, and if you have never seen a Michael Bay movie, this might be a plus. However, after having seen four of them, there is nothing new here. I mean this could have worked as a stunt video absent of dialogue for christ sake, and it would have probably faired better.

Watching this movie made me think about how hard is it really to become a blockbuster director? And why do great talents take such sloppy roles?

Save you hard earned cash by not buying this video, and if you still like Michael Bay, go buy The Rock.",1136678400,,3788,4.561946902654867
850120,3,6304328583,"I wasn't sure what I was going to think about this movie.  I thought the concept was an interesting premise, of rich people cloning themselves as life insurance to promote the longevity of their own lives.  Nice, right? Well not exactly.  Although, I found Ewan McGregor nice to look at, the movie definitely lacks logic. But it has intensity for action and adventure.

The ride felt more choppy than smooth.  For example, I don't remember Ewan's character ever really wondering why others were not in risk of contamination...only the clones were and the people who were chosen to maintain security...why were they chosen.  Also, how did this ""Island"" happen to remain free of contamination, if it was global situation...and why must people be picked to go to the island...if it's free of containation, everyone should already be on the island, relaxing and procreating.  Okay, maybe that was getting into deep of the backstory, but it seems to be an important wonder, since he was always wondering the reasons and whys of things. But it's just odd that he has these instincts, but doesn't even realize that he's best friends with a beautiful woman...or perhaps he does realize it and can't truly act.  Who knows?  It just seemed strange to me, it's not logical.

850121,4,6304328583,"No one will ever accuse director Michael Bay of making cutting-edge films, but he certainly knows how to put on a show, and when you add a cast of first-rate actors, the end result can be great fun. ""The Island"", a 'concept' film that borrows liberally from ""THX 1138"", ""Westworld"", ""The 6th Day"", ""Coma"", ""Capricorn One"", and especially ""Logan's Run"", is basically lightweight fluff, the kind of entertainment where you bring out the popcorn and leave logic at the door. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; his 1998 SF epic, ""Armageddon"", is one of the most entertaining 'dumb' movies of the past decade. With this film, however, Bay has set the bar to a whole new level!

The concept, nearly a reworking of ""Logan's Run"", is intriguing, if shaky. A vast underground laboratory of clones created to supply replacement parts for rich clients is run by smoothly evil Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean, who seems to have a corner on villainous roles, these days). Juiced up with steroid mixtures to bring them to adulthood quickly (a system that is, besides being impossible, downright risky for anybody planning to USE the parts!), false memories are implanted, and the clones, at the mental level of teens, live happy, if limited lives, believing themselves survivors of an ecological disaster, and dreaming of winning the lottery (in ""Logan's Run"", it was 'Carousel') that will whisk them off to the only untouched haven on earth, 'The Island'. In truth, winning the lottery means you are about to be harvested for parts, but this is, of course, kept from them.

But Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has nagging questions, fueled by sympathetic staffer McCord (the always entertaining Steve Buscemi), and when his best friend, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson, looking far too beautiful for a program where sexual desire is 'eliminated') 'wins' the lottery, he discovers what her fate is REALLY to be...and the pair escape into the 'real' world, pursued by an army of hit men commanded by Djimon Hounsou.

The chase is when the story really takes off, and it is as spectacular a series of stunts as has ever been staged for an action film. You may ask yourself how Lincoln is so proficient in driving skills (he can know these, instinctively, yet he DOESN'T comprehend SEX???), but if you don't allow logic to interfere with entertainment, you'll be in for a helluva ride!

While the finale is another 'lift' (of the final scene of ""Logan's Run""), the characters are so likable, and the resolution is so satisfying that only the most cynical of viewers will be disappointed.

Michael Bay has done it, again!",1136505600,,2602,4.904545454545454
850122,3,6304328583,"2016 is only ten years from now and The Island is packed with visuals of technology that probably won't be available for at least a hundred years.  A small point I know, but the expense of rail lines that float on air and gigantic towers, skyscrapers that are really underground in an old missile silo, well, I didn't believe it.

The Island did poorly in the theatres.  The huge cost of the special effects were not recouped and Michael Bay of the low-brow visual extravaganzas like Pearl Harbor lays an egg with an overly long tale of cloning for human harvest. Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johansson are nice to look at though they have little to work with.  The reason a gal like Scarlet gets film work, her appearance can keep an overwrought production interesting for a scene here and there.  I wonder if she has undergone some Hollywood plastic surgery since Lost in Translation because her face and body are beginning to resemble Angelina Jolie.

I think the theme of human greed versus humanity is an unusually Conservative idea for Bay, a Hollywood guy.  The screenwriter takes a poke at the American President which sounded eerily like the Bush haters of today; yet, this theme is Pro-Life.  That's right?  Cloning is wrong.  Body part harvesting for pay is wrong.  I salute the director on this score.  Otherwise, there are too many same, same, video game-like, hair-raising chase scenes, too many mindless escapes, and too few sensible lines uttered by pretty faces.",1136505600,2,1476,4.813492063492063

850194,4,6304328583,"I had heard a lot of the negative press about The Island, but bought it on a whim, and I'm not disappointed.  Most science fiction is permeated by paranoid leftist/luddite nonsense (ala the Alien series, with the megacorporation ""Company"" to blame for everything, or ""The Day After Tomorrow"", with its pop-science global warming nonsense, or ""The Core"" in which nasty pentagon types have destabilized the earth's center, etc., etc. etc).  Even Logan's Run, a film contrasted with The Island, illustrates a world more informed by the thoroughly discredited ""The Population Bomb"" than any legitimate threat to human existance.

The Island takes on the moral questions raised by the neoeugenic movement and explores their ramifications. This represents bravery, and explains the negative press.  Tear down any sacred cow you like - just don't mess around with Christopher Reeve's stem cells!  The vitriol with which the modern eugenicists defend their flimsy science is astounding, but certainly Hollywood is working as the propaganda machine (as California vote results have shown).  But ultimately the question raised by the film is very uncharacteristic of leftist Hollywood: does man have a soul?  Despite some unexplored issues of mind/body dualism, and the questionable ""shared memory"" bit that makes up a major hinge of the plot, the thematic elements of The Island were a welcome bit of meat in an industry that is pure sugarwater.

Ewan McGregor is, as always, brilliant, while the remainder of the cast is solid but forgettable, the sole exception being the evil doctor guy (whose name I forget).

While much of the action was overdone and silly,  the special effects and scenery were excellent.  Certainly there were some pretty gaping holes in the plot, but most were associated with a lack of imagination into how culture and technology may have changed in the future. This is particularly evident in the ""Roadhouse bar"" segment.

All in all, an intriguing and well done action film, which, while being by no means a masterpiece of cinema, is far more intelligent and relevant than 98% of the drivel spewed out by Hollywood.",1136332800,,2134,5.153623188405797

Some stuff was like ""I know they did not really put that in the script.  I think that most people give it the extra hype because it is a Michael Mann film.  The story was great, the concept of the entire movie was excellent.  It had you guessing what the deal was and trying to figure everything out through almost the entire movie.  Only issues I realy had were:  The year was 2019.  Why were mostly all of the vehicles in the movie 2005 cars.  Chrysler Cadillac and Dodge (prettymuch the same company).  Every once in a while, they threw a few futuristic looking cars in there. But 90% of the people were driving a 2005 model car in 2019. Yeah right.  Also The shoes that they wore were pumas from last year.  They may kind of look futuristic but, they aren't. just kinda stood out to me because they kept showing these shoes like they were getting paid to by puma . (same thing with the nokia signs all over the place).  If they were getting all of this sponsorship from Chrysler/dodge/Cadillac, nokia, and puma, they should of put more money into the backgound scenery.  The last issue was the ending. I won't spoil it, but it ended with many questions left up in the air.  I hate movies that end without being complete.  Unless they plan on making a sequel.

850201,5,6304328583,"Michael Bay films usually consist of three things: 1) some sort of love story, 2) that sunny, glossy look of his films, and 3) action galore, with always one car chase.  ""The Island"" follows these rules like all of his other films, but you have to hand it to Bay - this is definitely his best work so far and not just in the action territory.  Yes, he can tell a story.

Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) questions his existence and others in a complex after the world has been contaminated.  He and others are survivors of the world's collapse and are now safe from any of the dangers.  Each day, there is a lottery and whoever wins the random drawing gets to go to the Island, the last pathogen-free zone on the Earth.  Many people are ticked off at the lottery, because they have been around for years, when people who have been there for a short time get a trip to the Island.

Lincoln questions the leader of the community underground named Merrick (Sean Bean) and tells him that he doesn't see a purpose in what they are doing.  You see, the people underground, have to work out rigorously, eat healthy, and follow structure.

Lincoln also has his eyes set on Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) who has just won the lottery and is going to the Island.

Finally, Lincoln finds that the Island is not what they seem and SPOILERS finds out that everyone underground is a clone of a real person on Earth.  Whenever the person gets sick or ill, they take organs from their clones who to the clients are in a vegetative state, not walking, moving organisms. END SPOILERS

The rest of the film consists of Lincoln and Jordan being chased by many people, trying to find their clients, and saving all the people back underground.

The plot I just explained may have jumped around a bit, but when you watch the film, it really makes sense and is pretty creepy.  Bay's films usually contain a bare plot, bad characters, and awesome action.  This one is different.

Ewan McGregor is perfect as the always questioning Lincoln and did pretty well hiding his accent.  Scarlett Johansson is outstanding, beautiful, and the chemistry between her and Ewan is so on.  Sean Bean plays another great bad guy.  He wasn't over the top or anything.  Steve Buscemi also shows up to give information to the characters.  He did a good job.  His part could have easily been a one-dimensional character, but he takes it further.

If you're going into a Bay film, as I've said before, you expect action.  I respect this film the most out of all his other ones, because the action feels subdued.  Yes, we got the car chases (the one with the metal dumbells goes down in the books), the shootouts, the fist-fights, and much more, but it all seems to serve a purpose instead of trying to impress us.  You'll probably have to suspend your belief at times, but don't get me wrong, the action sequences are very cool.

Bay is always a great director when it comes to action movies and it's no different here.  His action sequences are filmed perfectly.  Yet, even the quieter moments of the film are done nicely and the pacing of the film never lags.  Well done, Mr. Bay.

Overall, this is Bay's best film.  The acting from McGregor and Johansson to the look of the film to the action are all great.  I have no idea why this bombed in theaters.  It's definitely one to check out.

850243,3,6304328583,"Thank you, Michael Bay, for reminding me exactly why I don't like action films.

Bay's latest movie, The Island, is basically a 136-minute hodgepodge of sci-fi plot and brainless action sequences. The story depicts a futuristic world where human clones are created for the super-wealthy (to be used for organ transplants to help their ""sponsors"" live longer, healthier lives). The clones are kept in a military bunker, unaware of their purpose in life. Thanks to altered memories, they believe that they are the only survivors of a widespread contamination of the planet (this keeps them from wanting to venture outdoors), and they're kept optimistic by the promise of The Island-the one non-contaminated spot on Earth. Of course, there is no ""Island."" The clones believe that ""winners"" are randomly picked from a lottery, while, in reality it's the clones that are selected for harvesting that are chosen.

Everything goes wrong when a naturally curious clone, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) discovers the secret of The Island and escapes with a friend, Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson). Aided by a facility worker played by Steve Buscemi, and pursued by government officials, Lincoln and Jordan race to find their sponsors in hopes of saving themselves as well as their friends back at the bunker.

The biggest problem with this film, I think, is that it had the potential to be a really good story, with chilling commentary on the dangers of human cloning. Even though the storyline was similar in many ways to Logan's Run and Minority Report, it displayed enough originality to stand on its own. Unfortunately, too often Michael Bay exploited the plot as an excuse for lots of special effects, fast car chases, and huge explosions.

The Island isn't a complete waste of time, however. The non-action sequences that focus more on the story are interesting, and the actors' performances are quite good when they're not just screaming and running for their lives. Scarlett Johansson is more than just a pretty face as the lead female, and Sean Bean gives a chilling performance as the amoral owner of the cloning facility. Steve Buscemi gives a quirky depth to a character that's mostly there for exposition, and Ewan McGregor-as always-shows off his fine acting chops (most notably in several scenes containing both Lincoln Six-Echo and his sponsor, Tom Lincoln, both played by McGregor).

While The Island does have its problems, it's still pretty entertaining in a guilty-pleasure sort of way.  It just didn't live up to its potential.",1135728000,,2546,5.12289156626506

850245,4,6304328583,"Ewan McGregor plays a man who lives in a futuristic society that he believes is the world today. Everyone is lead to believe that the air outside is poison. Yet one lucky person at a time wins a so called trip to a place called the Island. McGregor uncovers that it's more like a trip to the surgery room where you're sacrificed to give someone the liver they need or any other body part. When his friend  played by Scarlett Johansson wins a trip there, he realizes he needs to get the both of them the hell out of there.

  That's when the film turns into an action packed ride. The beginning is more of a brilliant sci-fi thriller and both parts work although they're basically like watching 2 different movies. In the outside world they realize what they've been missing. They see that the air isn't poison and that they're actually the clones of people in the real world. People who are waiting for their organs in-order to survive. Since they're clones they have feelings too and while on the run they also plan to expose the cloning facility to the entire world. Since not everyone knows about the place.

  Michael May had some clunky and pointless car chases in Bad Boys 2 and here he gives us the best highway car chase since the Matrix Reloaded. Yet this film made farless money than Bad Boys 2 or any of Bay's other bad films when it's by far better. It's even by far the best clone movie. It's way better than The 6th Day or Godsend. If there's cloning going on so people can get a liver transplant while clones are getting false hope. The movie makes you against cloning and we know there's attempts in cloning going on since we hear it on the news from time to time. The movie gives you a strong message while being entertaining and fun the entire time. Newsday just dis-missed the film with one star but no way is this a one star movie.

850247,3,6304328583,"When this film arrived in August it was like a huge ship which was launched out into the water, but which, as it rolled down the gangway, proceeded at full speed right to the oceean floor.  I'm sure Michael Bay and his crew were aghast as their $120M+ investment vanished in one weekend without making a cent.. Kabooom!!

The question is: Why did the Island fail, even as I-Robot made big money in 2004 and both of the main stars were eminently bankable?

The answer:

1)The formula was too obvious!  The first big twist was given away in the Trailers! There was no mystery to unravel, and this kind of film needs new territory and discovery.

2) It's talking to the audience at a very low level. Successful films skip certain kinds of detail because the audience can fill in the gaps with their imagination.  For example, in Star Wars, Luke Skywalker comes back to his home on Tatooine and sees the burned out skeletons... That says it all.. Less is more, and then you can build a longer story because you're talking to the audience faster and in shorthand. But not on The Island.

3)The characters were too thin.  Every word followed the plot, which is understandable given the constraints of film, that is 2.3 hours - max..  But they had no motivations or quirks and these were necessary if one were to care about these people. They felt flat and colorless. Even as they were escaping the complex I didn't feel invested in whether they survived or not.

4) And then perhaps the Zeitgeist had moved away from the questions that The Island seeked to answer, which is some philosophical/ethical blather about the value of the individual/life in a future where technology opens new pitfalls and opportunities for abuse.

The problem with cloning they were exploring is that the technology assigns value and previously un-quantifiable attributes to one's genes and tissues instead of our thoughts and choices, thus eliminating the place of 'free will' in society and setting up the foundation for humanity to be bought and sold and bred like cattle. It's a bad scene, and some version of it will probably emerge within the next 100+ years.

It makes for a good college level bio-ethics class, but the movie-going public has only a limited tolerance for Future-Philosophical-Dystopia movies. For example, Eon Flux, which made a similar statement and also underperformed at the box office. This kind of idea-movie has to be done very carefully and with human feeling or it feels like a cold thought-experiment.  And that's what this feels like, with some terrific car chases thrown in.

Still, three stars for the lovely Ms. Johannson.  She's a Greek goddess and I cannot look away.  [...]",1135555200,4,2685,4.802173913043478
850248,4,6304328583,"I wasn't very sure if I wanted to see ""The Island"" when it first came out.  Sure, it looked like a really cool action yarn, but something about it was holding me back.  Well, I finally got up the courage to check this film out and I have to admit that it was a rather good movie.  Directed by Michael Bay, who's directed such action fare as ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock,"" the viewer is insured that there will be plenty of explosions and gunplay.

The story is rather compelling.  In the near future, a doctor (played sinisterly to perfection by Sean Bean) develops a way to create clones that match the age and makeup of an actual person.  These clones supply spare parts for their respective ""clients.""  Think of it as a sort of biological auto shop.  One of the clones, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor), starts to question the alternate reality that he and his fellow clones are residing in.  As the days go by, clones win the ""Lottery"" and are sent to the Island.  In other words, lottery winners are sent to a medical unit where they are basically gutted for livers, hearts, kidneys, etc.  Some of the female clones are used for breeding so that their client won't have to go through child labor, nursing, or any of the other pains of motherhood.  McGregor's character is also drawn to Scarlett Johansson's character, Jordan Two-Delta.  When she wins the lottery, McGregor escapes with her to learn the ugly truth of what is actually going on.  Of course, in true Michael Bay style, explosions and countless chases ensue.

With a cast packed full of stars such as Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Steve Buscemi, you expect solid acting.  You get that in this film.  McGregor and Johansson are a likeable pair, and McGregor takes on two roles as the film unfolds.  As stated before, Sean Bean is stellar as the doctor who is unrelenting in his attempt to capture the escaped clones and protect his investment. There are also some recognizable faces from televison with rather brief but valuable contributing roles.

This film is really plot driven, which is a departure somewhat for Bay.  However, he really shines with the action sequences.  From heart-pounding car/jetbike(WASP) chases to good ol' shoot'em ups.  Bay covers all territories nicely.  Most of the action is flawless, though a few of the CGI sequences can be picked apart.

Overall, this is a really good film worthy of multiple viewings.  If you enjoy films such as ""Equilibrium"" (also starred Sean Bean), ""Minority Report,"" or ""The Rock,"" you're sure to love this film.  If you like action films in general, this one will take your breath away.  Definitely a purchase for the sci-fi and action fan.  Highly recommended.",1135555200,2,2698,4.7813852813852815
850249,4,6304328583,"I would have given this DVD five stars if it weren't for the lack of bonus materials. One of the reasons why DVD movies are so appealing is the inclusion of bonus materials which generally enlighten the viewer as to how the movie was made, special effects, and interviews with actors, directors, etc. This DVD contained none of the above. BUT, the movie itself was outstanding! We've all heard the comparison to Clonus, and I have been amazed at how many negative reviews I have read about this sci-fi thriller. It is obviously a moral tale, more pertinent today than ever due to the advancements in cloning and its current usage. But beyond that it is an exciting and fast-paced thriller with an all-star cast and excellent supportive acting. It kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Unfortunately reviews can discolor and even taint one's expectations of a movie, and I was hesitant about seeing it. I waited for the DVD, and was very pleaseantly surprised by the overall quality. The special effects were superb, the soundtrack beautfully haunting and supportive of the film. At times the story is very touching and sad, at others horrifying, and I couldn't help wondering if perhaps somewhere someone is indeed actually cloning humans for just the purpose shown. It is a frightening thought, but not an unrealistic one. A very thought provoking film.

______________________________________________________________________________

Michael Bay (director of Armageddon and The Rock) pulls from several previously successful films and presents a modestly interesting premise: how far will humanity go in the science of cloning? Can you murder a creation of mankind? Or will it simply be seen as harvesting organs? What if humanity doesn't know how far some scientists have gone?

Ewan McGregor pulls in an ""okay"" performance as a clone with a questioning conscious. He alone discovers the truth behind their existence: being ""throw-away"" people designed to replace the organs of those individuals from whom they were cloned.

Borrowing heavily from one of my favorite cult classic SF films (Logan's Run), I was hoping that Michael Bay might update that film and put a new face on it. But no.

The deep messages of this film are never resolved or explored. In their place are unbelievable chase scenes and convenient plot twists that will make many viewers groan with disbelief (How can Ewan McGregor ride a futuristic sky-bike if he's never even seen one? How can he and Scarlett Johansson supposedly survive a multi-story fall from a building?  etc.).

There are, however, lots of interesting questions and concepts that are put forth from within the film's script. It's just too bad that the producers/screenwriters/directors didn't explore them and give us a great psychological impact rather than fancy motorbike rides through impossible situations.",1135296000,,2394,5.3121693121693125

And not action that is cheesy and unbelievable (with the occasional slip up, such as them falling from a high rise and landing in a net none the worse), but rather action that is well made and choreographed, with the special effects looking real.

Now, the acting is a little cheesy, but that is because of the script.  ""Dood.""  ""He's in the can?""  ""Who is God?""  Kind of on par for the film and where the subjects are supposed to be, but still a little hard to believe, even when you suspend reality.  Additionally, it is just too much to pawn off everything to, ""They are acquiring the real memories of their real duplicate selves"" and then have them fly a motorcycle a-la Star Wars, or suddenly, from looking at a monitor of people kissing, to knowing what sex is and being able to do it.

Despite the few slip ups and small glitches in the screenplay, this movie turned out to be pretty good.  A huge surprise.  If you are looking for a pure action play, then this is your movie.  I would recommend.",1135296000,2,1159,4.26605504587156
850334,5,6304328583,"***SPOILER WARNING***

In 1846, a slave named Dred Scott sued for his freedom.  The court ruled that Scott was ""property"" and had to remain a slave.

In 2019, two clones named Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta, discovering that they've been living under a death sentence, escape from their underground facility.  The facility's director, Dr. Merrick, sends a whole SWAT-team of mercenaries after them with orders to shoot to kill.  Murder never crosses anyone's mind because the two are just ""agnates,"" or (even less flattering) ""product.""

Merrick's insistence on seeing the clones as non-human prevents him from giving them credit for human ingenuity--thus setting himself up for the events that blow the lid off his business.  Because the guards apparently see themselves as babysitting cows too dumb to know they're in a slaughterhouse, they're caught by surprise when Lincoln and Jordan bolt and fight back. It's almost as if nature is saying, You can't devalue humanity this way; no matter how you twist perceptions, the reality stands unchanged.  And it will come back to haunt you.

As Merrick notes to prospective clients, the laws of 2019 allow for growing clones for spare parts as long as they remain ""vegetative.""  Apparently society is trying to have it both ways, and someone like Merrick will inevitably abuse those laws, especially when vegetation doesn't seem to work.

By now we know what to expect from a Michael Bay movie, and he delivers it in spades.  But he doesn't sacrifice characterization for spectacle. The clones have a whole array of personalities: hyperactive Jones Three Echo, who's convinced The Lottery is rigged and tries to figure it out on paper; grumpy malcontent Gandu Three Echo, who can't resist messing with the new arrivals; and (most noteworthy) Michael Clarke Duncan as Starkweather Two Delta, a child in a football player's body, delighted to win the Lottery and anguished when he discovers the truth.

Meanwhile, the supposedly human guards are grim-faced enforcers who keep ordering Lincoln and Jordan to separate and, in one scene, watch a film of a screaming, dying inmate as if it was Comedy Central, howling with laughter (at least till their boss Merrick shows up).  It's an interesting contrast.  As with the upcoming film ""Hostel,"" this is art imitating a disturbing side of life.  But hey, they're just product, right?

There's also an excellent scene in which Mack (Steve Buscemi) has to break the news to Lincoln and Jordan that everything they've been led to believe is a lie (""Why do I gotta be the guy who tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?"").  He's a loser who everyone ignores, yet when all hell breaks loose he rises to the occasion, putting himself in harm's way to save his friends.  Lincoln and Jordan follow his example later on, returning to the facility to liberate the others in spectacular Michael Bay fashion.

Action films with explosions, car chases, guns and demolition thrills are a dime a dozen, especially in this CGI age.  But in The Island, the thrills are more of a Hollywood medium to convey a reminder: Human beings are human beings, whatever label anyone may slap on them, be it Product, Agnate, B**ch or the N-word.  This is driven home when Laurent (Djimon Hounsou), the leader of the mercenaries, sees the number on Jordan's wrist--like the number branded on his own hand years before.  ""It's so people would see that (my brothers and I) were less than human,"" he explains to Merrick.  He has a change of heart and eventually helps Lincoln and Jordan save the clones.

People might malign this film as just another Michael Bay smash-fest, but I think he strikes a fair balance between message and action, neither getting too heavy-handed with the message, nor letting the action run away with the story.  The Island, first and foremost, entertains--but through the entertainment it asserts that human beings are, and always will be, just that.  Even if they were cloned in vats for rich sponsors and given coded names.",1135209600,3,4015,4.953731343283582

But as soon as the movie captures our attention it fizzles and what is left is two and a half hours of noisy endless destructive chase sequences that put this reviewer to sleep.

Using fine actors like Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson and Sean Bean one would think more attention would have been paid to a good script.  They have us in the beginning as we slowly come to realize that this space-age environment is not the 'rescue place' from the end of the world by contamination, but rather a very expensive human cloning lab where wealthy people up on top of the subterranean lab life have paid huge sums of money to have duplicate donors on whom to rely for organs and integument  as age begins to erode their own.  Every 'person' in the lab (thinking that they are waiting transfer to the Garden of Eden Island of the title) is actually a manufactured copy of the owners topside.

Well, not all secrets can remain hidden and McGregor follows a butterfly to discover the truth about the venture and the rest of the tale is McGregor's and Johansson's escape into the world above in search of their 'real' counterparts.  Once on the surface of the earth the movie goes downhill fast in a mixture of special effects and destruction derby that it just loses all interest.  This is a movie that only avid fans of McGregor and Johansson will want to see - because there is little else to recommend it!  Grady Harp, December 05",1135209600,2,1638,4.601374570446735

But after seeing it, and even with my expectations in check, I have to admit I was disappointed. The main problem is the script, whose sole interest seems to be to move from one action sequence to the next, disregarding how unrealistic or implausible certain story elements may be.

Firstly, in such a controlled, sanitized environment, you'd think two rogue, very naive clones would have at least some trouble revolting. Yet McGregor and Johansson (unarmed) seem to have little difficulty beating up all the guards, outsmarting them, and running around creating havoc throughout the entire place, enough to finally beat this multi-million dollar complex and break free.

Now... to then hear Sean Bean (the Institute's boss) nervously disclose how $120 billion of funding is at stake if word of the breach gets out, is sadly laughable...

First, even for 2019 that is an inordinate amount of money. 2nd, assuming it had been invested in the cloning project, you'd think there'd be at least one or two guards in every corner of that place! but no... our heroes innocence seems to outsmart 120 billion clams worth of guards, weaponry and overall security. Amazing...! and this incredible feat continues throughout the streets of Los Angeles for the rest of the film.

To summarize, the crashes, explosions and chases are pretty spectacular for the most part, but the movie moves in such a fast underdeveloped way that there is little emotion invested by the viewer to ultimately care that much who will win. The too quick wrap-up at the end more than supports this fact - that the movie was crafted on action scenes - not storyline.

It's not a bad rental, and the cast is great, but it's a movie with clear problems throughout.",1135123200,,1963,4.87987987987988
850339,3,6304328583,"Michael Bay, one of the more despised directors in Hollywood tends to make what I call ""fluff pieces"". They're not meant to be anything more than big explosive entertainment while numbing our mind in the process. The Island is Michael's first attempt at being a bit intelligent(loose use on that word) and be a little question-posing but then it becomes a typical sterilized world where everything's shiny and cool-looking but no emotional connection.

Imagine waking up at a precise time, your clothes already picked and if there's an imbalance in your body, they ban it from your food and go on a diet. It's a world of extreme control which echoes 1984. Only as usual, someone questions his existence. In this case it's Lincoln Six Echo and together with Jordan Three Delta they escape the facility and learn the truth of their place(I won't spoil it despite the fact reviews and the trailer probably already did it for me).

The film's success, or should I say the lack of it, most likely caused Dreamworks Pictures to be bought by Paramount. The film essentially didn't know how to promote it. They showed the sterile sheen of the facility and the outside world and even spoiled what the place is used for. So it's an existential intrigue drama with typical Michael Bay boomness. So they promoted it as such, making it too bipolar for an audience I assume.

And you can tell the film's in 2 halves: in the facility and off. When they're in, everything's with glass, bright lights, tons of white clothing and post-modern architecture. They leave it's gritty and tons of explosions and there's the problem. It's trying to be 2 things at once but without the finesse of it. Blame it on Michael Bay probably since he loves his smashyness of things although it's toned down since Jerry Bruckheimer didn't produce.

Performances are nice although not very dynamic. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanssen play a nice couple while normal menacing Sean Bean isn't really that much of a threat. Even him on the phone in Don't Say a Word had more villainness than here. And of course Steve Buscemi is back although better than in Armageddon and Michael Clarke Duncan's back too, on screen for about 10 minutes and doesn't leave much of a mark(personally, it's like he tries to hard to show he can ""act"".)

I'm going to predict this and say there's a 2 disc Criterion edition coming out since there's not much extras. So in 2 ways I'm recommending that you rent: one to save money and also it's not really much of a good purchase.",1135123200,,2520,4.705215419501134

850395,4,6304328583,"""The Island"" was supposed to be a big Summer 2005 action movie, but it flopped at U.S. box offices. That's too bad, because this is a better film than director Michael Bay's 1998 action blockbuster ""Armageddon"", and it's a lot easier on the ear drums too. ""The Island"" did well in overseas box office. It's failure in the U.S. is blamed on poor marketing. The ads emphasized the film's nebulous themes instead of trying to sell it as an action movie. Mistake. The film's premise is interesting, although not actually plausible, but this is an action-packed game of chase. Themes aside, ""The Island"" is about an innocent young couple being pursued by evil-doers with big guns. A moderately interesting story and a talented cast make it that much better.

In the year 2019, brilliant geneticist Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) provides needy people with organs and tissues cloned from their own DNA. Those who can afford to pay can replace organs lost to illness or injury with perfect clones. Unbeknownst to the clients, Dr. Merrick has been unable to produce suitable organs in vegetative clones. He clones the entire person and then destroys the clone when the organs are harvested. Merrick's Institute keeps an entire population of clones in an underground city under the pretense that they are survivors of a massive contamination of the planet, so they can't go outside. The Island is a single remaining ""pathogen-free zone"", and people get the opportunity to move there by lottery. Unfortunately for Merrick, some of the clones have developed greater intellect than he supposed. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) has begun to question his surroundings and developed a friendship with a young woman named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johanssen).

Since ""The Island"" is set in 2019, it has more advanced technology that we do -some of the ideas came from Microsoft's think tank- but it's close enough to us to have immediacy. The audience just has to take the clones' plight at face value. It defies logic but is provocative enough to add interest. The Institute's underground city is visually captivating, and director Michael Bay put together an impressive cast: Ewan McGregor plays duel, and opposite, roles. Scarlett Johanssen makes her dumb-but-determined character sympathetic. Quirky Steve Buschemi has a pivotal supporting role. And Sean Bean gives Dr. Merrick, who is confident in the righteousness of his agenda, sufficient stature. The action sequences run a familiar gamut, including helicopters with skyscrapers and an extended car chase, but they have some creative twists. ""The Island"" is really a solid action film that will appeal to anyone looking for adrenaline-pumping entertainment.

The DVD (Dreamworks 2005): There is one featurette and an audio commentary by director Michael Bay. ""The Future In Action"" (15 minutes) is a documentary about shooting the film's action sequences, in particular the car chase and the giant ""R"" falling from the building. It includes interviews with director Michael Bay, the stunt coordinator, visual effects supervisor, and special effects supervisor, among others. In the audio commentary, Michael Bay provides scene-by-scene commentary for most scenes, focusing mostly on technical aspects of the film, such as production design, sets, the film's technologies, and challenges. There is also some commentary on cast, characters, and the film's box office problems. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.",1134864000,5,3482,5.281588447653429
850396,3,6304328583,"""The Island"" is a movie that tries hard to engage your head in the first half and then throws all deep thoughts aside as the last half takes off and director Michael Bay plays to his strengths.  This futuristic movie is tethered to the present by our expectation that cloning human beings will one day be a reality and our belief that the rich and beautiful people of the world will do anything to keep both their looks and their money.  We are introduced to a sterile world that exists at the end of the 21st century such as we have seen in such films as ""THX 1138.""  The world has been contaminated because of such great calamity and those who have survived are living in an organized society where everybody has to know their place and proximity to others is a big concern.

Each day everybody stops working long enough to pay attention to the announcement as to who has won the lottery and a chance to take a trip to the Island, the last pathogen-free zone on the planet.  Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) has heard about the Island all of his life and has a lot of questions, the first one being why is it he cannot have bacon with his breakfast?  Suffice it to say that halfway through the film our hero finds out enough about what is going on to know the time has come to get out of Dodge with his best friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson).  This is when this 2005 film because a chase movie, as Merrick (Sean Bean), the bad guy running the place sends Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou), a hired mercenary, to bring back the runaways.

""The Island"" should really be a horror story, more like ""Soylent Green"" than ""Logan's Run,"" but that is not the way things are going to play out in a Michael Bay film.  The chases and the explosions are all quite exciting and we should all be rooting for Lincoln and Jordan to stay alive and reveal the truth (not necessarily in that order).  At this point there should be a problem in that a pair of clones raised in a protected environment and educated to the level of a high school freshman around the time of the Great Depression, the pair lack should lack the capacity to think and requisite knowledge to survive in the ""real"" world.  There are a couple of nice gags when they encounter euphemisms for the first time, but that should only prove they are doomed.  However, it turns out that as a third generation clone (hence the Echo designation), Lincoln has a few convenient changes in his brain that allow us to pretend this all makes sense.

Left in the wake of the giant action sequences are the bio-ethical and moral issues raised by having the rich own their own replacement parts to be harvested as the need arises.  Apparently meeting the legal definition of a product negates the obvious evidence of our eyes as to what is a human being (maybe the Civil War really was just about state's rights).  As I said, this really should have been a horror film rather than descending into another chase film.  I was almost going to round up because during the chase part we do find out more and more about this futuristic world and there are things of interest worth discussing.  But the characters end up moving so fast that we do not really get a good look at that brave new world.  Sometimes less is more and sometimes the same case can be made for slower.",1134777600,2,3314,4.422697368421052

850398,2,6304328583,"NOTE TO HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: PLEASE STOP GIVING THESE GREAT MOVIES TO PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL BAY AND ROLAND EMMERICH!!!!

Once again... what could have been a GREAT, memorable movie, is destroyed by a, I'm sorry, but a brainless director who thinks all the audience wants is destruction and chaos. I'm sorry, but it's true. We all love ACTION. We love it when a movie gets our adrenaline going and WE LOVE CHAOS... but THERE HAS TO BE SOME LOGIC TO IT. When you insult the audiences intelligence... you INSTANTLY LOSE THEM.

THE ISLAND has it all. In fact, I watched this movie for quite awhile, wondering WHY I WAS ACTUALLY ENJOYING A MICHAEL BAY MOVIE. It had twists and mystery and INTELLIGENCE. It had a great premise and I won't give it away, because that's just not nice.

But then, about halfway through the movie, all of the twists and mysteries were uncovered and revealed, and I thought... eewww, that's only the beginning... I wonder what other twists there will be. Well, I should have known better, because that must have been where the original script ended and Michael Bay took over.

That was about the time that the main nemesis hired the WORST HITMEN in the world. And I say that jokingly because their actually supposed to be the best.  These hitmen have choppers and outnumber the two UNARMED and SOCIALLY RETARDED targets 12 to 2, and choose to go about their business destroying everything in sight, LOUDLY and CRAZILY. Not to mention, they're driving through a busy and crowded Los Angeles firing like maniacs and yelling things like ""GET THEM!"" and ""THERE THEY ARE FIRE!""

I think, later on, they were even told to do things quietly.

Then there was the big giant letter hanging from the side of the building. Our two main stars are clinging for their lives to this huge letter that is teetering from falling for minutes while our 'HITMEN' fire into it wildly... it slowly begins to break away from the building... and just as it's about to fall.... creaking... falling... creaking... here it goes... the helicopter pilot decides to fly right underneath it so that it can get caught up in the carnage too and tumble to the ground in a firey ball of destructive wonder.

Oh, and of course, our main stars get caught up in some harmless netting and fall to the ground with a slight scratch on one of their heads.

Our two main stars climb aboard a semi-truck loaded with GIANT BARBELS and they eventually decide to dislodge them in order to stop their attackers. As these monsterous barbels destroy car after car and fall one after the other on the L.A. freeway, I kept wondering... WHY ISN'T THIS TRUCKER PULLING OVER? He just lost his entire frickin' load!!!

I'm not gonna go on forever discussing all this junk. I love action movies, but YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT WITHIN THE REALM OF ACCEPTABILITY, STORYLINE and RIDICULOUSNESS. The action sequences in THE ISLAND seem like just what they are, THROWN IN to please the audience.

Well, they didn't please me. Were they cool? You betcha! Were they ridiculous? You betcha. Were they necessary? Not at all.

Bay actually had a good thing going. A great premise, a great idea... ruined by a Director who has this screwed up idea that audiences are stupid and just want destruction.

We like destruction, but it better be logical and necessary. A perfect example: the action sequences in DIE HARD. They were over the top... but you know what, they kept them in the realm of acceptability... and they FIT WITH THE STORY!

I reitterate, please!! Hollywood! Stop! Somehow... I'm not sure, but Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich have been given this Willie Wonka golden ticket to make what ever movie they want in hollywood with whatever budget and they disappoint time after time... and yet... ???

Whatever happened to the sensible directors that realized that audiences actually have brains, and don't like being insulted? I hate to tell them, but not everybody in the audience is a 13-20 year old video game playing boy. Some of us are 35-year-old video game playing boys.",1134777600,4,4029,4.727532097004279

850400,4,6304328583,"The convolution of the future often rests within imagination, as people tend to imagine the most dreadful possible while often inserting a heavy dose of science to the notion.  The reason for the negative futuristic outlook might rest in the intention of self-preservation.  On occasion, the cynical expectations rest in the support from previous experiences and historical events.  With history repeating itself, the audience will uncover an intriguing science fiction tale of great injustice and moral wrong in Michael Bay's action filled The Island.

The opening dream sequence with tidbits of beautiful seaside scenery, an amazing speedboat, and a beautiful woman induces a sense of serenity.  However, the brief pleasure suddenly submerges into a nightmarish hell where the main character Lincoln Six Echo, performed by Ewan McGregor, finds himself drowning in the dream.  Urgently, Lincoln tries to save himself, but there are others pulling him down, as the nightmare continues.  Flashes of a various symbols such as an island, biohazard, speedy motorcycles, stop signs, and many others explode before his cerebral visual cortex leaving the audience with a powerful and vaguely familiar warning.  While the last words, ""The Island awaits you"", echo in the mind of Lincoln.

Imagine waking up every day with skin sensors providing information about every single biochemical imbalance generated within the body to maintain homeostasis.  This includes detailed measurements of REM sleep affected by nightmarish episodes, efficient urine tests that plan the daily meals to sustain perfect health, and wearing white Puma sports outfits as uniforms.  Most would consider this an unhealthy obsession with health and fitness, as life's many irregularities and pleasures are erased on the expense of homeostasis.  However, having this notion tossed with the idea of living in a tightly secured mega complex that contains a deadly contamination outside, might have many reconsider the notion of obsessive approach towards a healthy lifestyle.  The only hope of something better only exists in the residents' draw of the luck to win a permanent trip to the Island.  The mythical rumors about the Island are constantly boosted by news briefings on the jumbotrons, as it encourages the only lasting hope among the people.

The dream sequence, the constant advice of the Island's greatness, and obsession with health begin to stir thoughts in the direction of something threatening.  In addition, the white Puma uniforms bring the atmosphere from THX 1138 (1971) by George Lucas, as do the dark uniforms of the law enforcement in the story.  Lincoln is one of the first to question the information provided to him by the leaders within the complex.  He is also begins to question the meaning of his existence.  Lincoln share some of these thoughts with his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) who breaks some of the minute rules within the complex such as giving away some of her bacon to Lincoln.  They also entertain each through a future version of the Xbox console.

The discovery of a bug and Jordan's emerging departure, as she won her trip to the island, augments Lincoln's curiosity to his existential purpose and the purpose of artificial home.  The inquisitiveness has also been feed by the hardware wiz McCord (Steve Buscemi) who Lincoln has developed a friendship with over his three years at the complex.  His investigation leads him to a part of the enormous building he did not know existed, and to his dismay uncovers a truth far more macabre than he could ever comprehend.  The discovery of the truth speeds up the film's second portion, as it develops into a festival in fireworks and extraordinary vehicles clashing in rapid succession.  The increase in the story's tempo has to do with Lincoln and Jordan's desire to stay alive, as their knowledge has deadly consequences for them.

The Island has the potential to be a very extraordinary film, as it deals with several contemporary and intriguing issues such as ethics of medicine, memory capability of genetics, stem cell research, and cloning.  Science fiction stories often offer cerebral assessments of the potential dangers of current times in the near and distant future.  Unfortunately, the Island does not allow much room for pondering these concepts, as it enters hyper-drive mode through spectacular action sequences where bullets scrape the consciousness.  The action forces the mind to focus on survival, which puts the different themes in a rather one-sided light while it leaves the audience scholarly traits in the dust.

Another troubling issue with the Island emerges through the strong resemblance the film has with other sci-fi films such as Fahrenheit 451 (1966), THX 1138 (1971), and Fortress (1993).  However, the use of the ideas from other stories does not make it awkward, but it removes much of the films uniqueness.  There are also a couple of scenes where some awkwardness emerges such as the culmination, which seems very Darth Vaderesque.  Nonetheless, the overall cinematic experience will present a rather crude journey with some truly amazing action scenes that in the end leaves a reality escaping audience satisfied and happy.",1134691200,2,5234,5.244897959183674
850401,4,6304328583,"A box office disappointment in its theatrical release, one has to wonder why THE ISLAND didn't catch on.  Certainly director Michael Bay's best film, it has a sleek look, some amazing action sequences and special effects and likeable performances from Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.  Is it a case of bad word of mouth from critics that halted its ascent?  One doesn't know, but THE ISLAND is entertaining and involving.  Along with its leads, it has some nice support from villainous Sean Bean and although his role is small and underdeveloped, Steve Buscemi is enjoyable as the clones' doomed ally.  It poses the question of just how far a person will go to avoid dying, and how clones could be thought of merely as Products to sell.  At any rate, I enjoyed THE ISLAND and recommend it to those who like their action fast and furious.",1134691200,2,842,4.732876712328767
850402,5,6304328583,"Mixed reviews are always interesting to read and the reasons why over a film like this...Make no mistake, while the topic of cloning is a seriously thought provoking subject matter (moral,ethical,medical issues,etc.)the viewer must not forget The Island is sheer entertainment ! Obvious visual and partial story line ingredients echo sci-fi films of the past such as Logan's Run,Blade Runner,THX-1138,Fifth Element----the list can go on forever. Think of what director Michael Bay has done is an homage to those films and not an easy rip off! Also, The Island manages to really hit close to home in that cloning technology in the 21st century isn't sci fi fodder any more, but fact. Could something like this really happen with clones? Is it happening already? Who knows...

Ewan McGregor portrays Lincoln who begins to question his existence and why things are the way they are in his clean-room environment society; This in great part is fueled by repetitive and haunting cryptic dreams that he cannot shake. Are they just dreams, memories, premonitions or all of the above? Are they his or someone else's? Are memory implants transferrable and possible? One can begin to see the underlying theme here about human existence and mortality that permeated and resonated strongly in 1982's sci-fi cult classic Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). Lincoln also suspects something is amiss and wants answers about The Island; A beautiful piece of remaining inhabitable paradise left untouched as an untainted remnant of the ""contamination"" war. Those fortunate enough to win the lottery get to leave their hermetically sealed world and live the remainder of their lives on Fantasy Island...or do they ?...Lincoln soon unravels the mystery of the Island. Under dire circumstances he escapes his underground hi-tech world with the lovely and intelligent Jordan played by Scarlett Johansson. Just watching the underground city escape sequences through the labyrinth of obstacles, tunnels and secret corridors brings back my own memories of watching Logan's Run in 1976 for the first time when Logan is also escaping the city with another runner named Jessica...Through Lincoln's own investigating he discovers the true horrors that await all residents of The Island...

McGregor never disappoints as an actor and over the years has established himself pretty well. He may not have the box office draw or pull of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, or even Tom Hanks, but his performances always come through with great believability and ease. He's not good at his craft;he's great at it ! Roles he has chosen are always likeable and easy for most audiences to connect with. Majority of roles he chooses compare to those  trustworthy friends we have and can easily hang out with with no pretentious airs. There's an honesty to his portrayal of characters (the guy you would want to back you up in a bar brawl). McGregor connects with the average Joe. Thus, his character wants answers that most of us want about our ""existence"" and place in the universe;All the why's and how's.

Steve Buscemi,ever since I saw him years ago in Reservoir Dogs, always garners a film with his unique acting talent. Regardless if he is cast in an Oscar contender of a film or the bomb of the year,  Buscemi always adds that ""lift"" or comical nuance that is unmistakebly his style and angle!

Scarlett Johansson as Jordan is a hot beauty that delivers as well. The chemistry between McGregor and Johansson works smoothly. Scarlett is destined to become even a bigger star as more roles come in and time goes by. She definitely has that ""it"" factor and a magnetic presence that indicates she's an actress and not just a cover girl hottie ! Her dialogue and character's emotional range may have seemed limited, but what was evident was absolutely tangible.

Give The Island a visit for the acting, story, and I almost forgot to mention, it's super sci-fi high octane special effects. Don't just judge it by saying ,""Oh, another sci-fi geek film"".Plenty of product plug ins as well that should make both Chrysler and Cadillac proud in showing off their hot current production autos and concept vehicles used as vintage and police cars in this film;20 years ago the movie RoboCop did the same for Ford by using the then somewhat ""futuristic"" and  stylish Taurus car(by 1980's standards that is)... Gotta love all the cars, toys and gadgets in this film !It's a pretty thrilling and captivating flick with amazingly slick and polished chase sequences and pyrotechnics !",1134691200,3,4539,5.03462050599201

Instead - what a fascinating concept and cleverly executed.  Much has been made of ""clones"" in the press lately - most people do not realize that technology now does not just make a duplicate ""Dolly"" - no, Dolly has to grow up - from fetal development onward.  Just what does that mean for the human clone? - Just what do you do with what is left - when the liver, eyes, kidneys, heart etc are removed? -- This film attempts to answer those questions - and believe me - given the naked greed our pharmaceutical and medical industry exhibits - I do not believe this film was far off on what may really happen if technology ever permits.

850456,3,6304328583,"As the king of big-budget Hollywood bombast, director Michael Bay has a reputation so commercially oriented that it's hard to view his films without some amount of visceral disdain. His latest venture is not an artistic breakthrough for him, by any means, but it is a diverting though overlong entertainment that seems to be an amalgam of John Frankenheimer's 1966 sleeper ""Seconds"", Ridley Scott's classically visionary 1982 ""Blade Runner"", Michael Anderson's comparatively cheesy 1976 ""Logan's Run"" and Philip Kaufman's 1979 savvy update of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with plenty of references to Bay's previous blockbusters thrown in as well. Clocking in at 136 minutes, the result is a confusing shuffle, but he has certainly assembled a grade-A cast to inhabit the rather cartoonish roles headed up by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as two residents of a sterile, futuristic society. Their characters' names - Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta - should give you fair warning of the world in which they inhabit with trepidation, and the first hour seems like it could lead to a more thoughtful analysis of the transience of identity at a time when it is not valued.

The clich-ridden screenplay (co-written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Caspian Tredwell-Owen) provides the derivative concept of a brilliant but greedy scientist who has figured out how to clone the rich and famous in order to allow them to take organs or even entire bodies when age and disease set in. The clones - unable to mature beyond the age of fifteen (how convenient) - are programmed to think they are humans living underground to avoid contamination unbeknownst to their ultimate fate. Alas, once Lincoln and Delta figure out what's going on, we enter Los Angeles in the year 2019 as envisioned by Bay as a series of skyward collisions and exploding buildings. This is when the movie either escalates into high gear for Bay aficionados or disintegrates into a morass of action set pieces, though granted, Bay's use of giant metal spools as terrorizing traffic devices is genuine good fun. Unfortunately though, I am still of the latter camp, and shame on me for having any higher expectation for this sort of popcorn filler. The overstylized cinematography of Mauro Fiore, which smacks of new millennium commercials on upscale product placement, is another dead giveaway.

Out of his Obi-Wan Kenobi guise, McGregor can get rather unctuous as a leading man, especially when the clone confronts his Scottish-accented antecedent, an obviously direct cousin to his smarmy Catcher Block in Peyton Reed's ""Down With Love"". Johansson is certainly luscious enough for her part, though she is not called upon to use her penetrating intelligence by any means. It's also disheartening to see a scene where she reacts emotionally to her duplicate within the actress's famous Calvin Klein ad. Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou play the parts of the scientist and his chief mercenary with predictable malice, though the latter has some unexplained epiphany toward the end. There is an extended cameo by Steve Buscemi, which is welcome at that point of the story though it's rather anachronistic and overly convenient. The ending is a bit of a bore given all that has come before, but it doesn't really matter, as Bay has concocted a movie that should please most of his fans and may even recruit a few new ones.",1133740800,3,3394,5.058928571428571

From beginning to end, the movie is fun to watch.  The soundtrack and acting are extremely well done, and if you can suspend your disbelief as you would with any other sci-fi/action movie, there's really no problem to be found with the plot, settings, or most anything else.

The CG is extremely well-done, and the overall look and design of the environments is immediately attractive and immersing.  Not once did I think that the CG was too over-the-top or overused.

Look, you're not going to be walking around, impressed for months on end.  You're not going to need a day to recover from the emotional impact.  It's a great action movie, and a lot of fun to watch on a date.  The romantic plotline is very well written and played out, and all predominantly romantic scenes are, well, hot.

There are so many sci-fi adaptations that trample on the foundations of science... but this was quite thought provoking in the manner of Gattaca, coupled with 'The Fugitive' style suspense and packed with an abundance of eye opening sequences similar to The Matrix.

At it's core, the plot is a summer thriller, refraining from imposing too many notions, but viewers with an appetite may spot the philosophical and moral dilemmas that coat this not too distant future.

I can see from other reviews that this was well received by the dvd community, and I agree... however there was one thing that really annoyed me with this film. The year is 2090?

That is almost 100 years from now, America would be unrecognisable. Instead, the clothes, hair, fashion, architecture, even cars were quite similar. The cars looked like concept cars we see in car shows right now, and the weapons???? Fair enough fashion has a way of revolving... CAll it retro... but weapons, if its one thing about our society, we spend billions of dollars on weapons technology.

Unusually intelligent questions for a Michael Bay(Bad Boys, Pearl Harbor) film, but ones that get asked and explored in the sci-fi thriller The Island. The film delivers a large dosage of the intense action that Bay fans will clamor for, while not going gruesome or over the top, ala Bad Boys 2.

The film revolves around Lincoln-Six-Echo(Ewan McGregor), who lives in a tightly controlled indoor society of people who can't remember where they came from. Everyone is told that the world outside is contaminated with a deadly virus, and once in a while a lottery is held and the winnery is taken to ""The Island"", the last safe place on Earth.

When Lincoln discovers the reality, which is that everyone in the society is a clone who will eventually be killed so that their natural born counterpart can have their organs, he takes his beautiful friend Jordan-Two-Delta(Scarlett Johansson) and goes on the run, entering the real world for the first time.

The Island begins briskly, exploring the clone colony just long enough that interest is not lost. The film takes off in the real world, as our heroes are relentlessly hunted by the evil head of the colony(Sean Bean) and meet one of their counterparts. A defect in the cloning process allows the heroes to adapt to the real world faster than anticipated, culminating with a daring return to the colony to expose the truth.

The Island is not a masterpiece. There are too many product placements in odd places (Xbox in the clone colony?) and at 136 minutes, the trip is a bit too long. People looking for a fun, thoughtful popcorn flick will be impressed. Indeed, by the end of the film both serious sci-fi fans and action fanatics should be throughougly satisfied, though not totally blown away.",1132963200,4,1982,4.733333333333333

It asks the question of whom do men think is god when they deny the Existence of the true God who created us and told us not to kill each other because we are made in His image.

If you are squamish about religious overtones, this and one other instance are the only references to God or Jesus, the other was where the head administrator is asked about playing God. This is none-the-less an action movie, and emotionally moving regarding freeing people from a life locked up with a future of being harvested and killed.

As for the product placement, there were two that I really noticed, one was for a certain water company and the other a certain ""X"" product. I think the ""X"" product was sort of funny, but then what are they doing advertizing to those locked up in a facility with no means of income. The water one makes some sense, if the product is brought in from the outside, I think it does bring some realism to the movie, otherwise the movie is just a non-descript fruture place and future time. It just goes to show that even in the future, comercialism still lingers. : P",1131580800,3,1730,4.403125

850504,4,6304328583,"The Island starring Ewan McGreggor and Scarlett Johanson is a very well thought out movie, and really exeeds expectations, at least in my book.  It didn't do to well in the box office, but that's because, like a lot of movies now a days, marketed the movie for something it's not.  Anyway, this is like anything you'd expect from Michael Bay, but unlike The Rock, Armaggeddon, Bad Boys and all his movies, it does have a very good plot in my opinion.  Here's the story:

In a very odd isolated world, lives a bunch of people who live in very uncolorfull world.  They are told that they are survivors from an apocalypse.  But, what they all wait for is their chance to go to the Island, the only land left on earth, and they have a poll every week to choose someone to go.  What they don't know is that they're actually clones of wealthy people, and when they are called to the island, the real person who owns the clone is injured, and they use the clones body parts or insides that the person has lost.  When Licoln Six Echo sees a butterfly inside the prison-type-holdment, he gets curious, as all living things are supposed to be dead.  He one day, ventures out into the real world, only to find danger and the truth.

The first half of the movie is waaaaaaay different then the second half.  It's like someone else directed the first half, then Michael Bay took over for all the action sequences.  But, ti's still a very good movie.  The humor is very straight foward and doesn't use any slick jokes, just very clear jokes.  The action can at times be over the top, but what do you expect.  All these people who say that it was too over the top or stupid, have you ever seen any of Michael Bay's other work, because every movie he's done has been over the top.  Anyway, I strongly recommend it for action fans.",1131494400,,1814,4.370149253731343
850505,4,6304328583,"Everyone I know who actually saw The Island pretty much loved it--myself included. The action was strong, and the plot was plausable and intriguing. The cast was also enjoyable. But, in a summer full of action movie blockbusters, the island was lost. Movie trailers portrayed this flick as just another mindless film with nothing setting it apart. With a budget of $120 million, obviously about $5 was spent on the marketing.",1130803200,,425,5.0
850506,4,6304328583,"Disclaimer -- I know nothing of Michael Bay.  Apparently he has a reputation for this sort of thing?

I'm really surprised at how this thing tanked. I split the difference for my rating: I'd say it was about a 3-star movie, up to 4 and a half if action is your thing (it's not mine) -- which makes it a lot better than much of the shlock that was out there this summer.  Where it failed, it wasn't for lack of trying, and I admire it for that.

I was not expecting a good movie. I was expecting to be either really bored or really unhappy (I scare easy) -- putting up with it uncomfortably for a few hours for the pleasure of hanging out with friends. I was not expecting to be entertained -- I was certainly not expecting to be engrossed.

The beauty of low expectations is that you are seldom disappointed and often pleasantly surprised.

The Island brought up all the moral questions about cloning you'd expect it to -- especially if cloning/harvesting involved complete, adult, sentient beings walking around and interacting in an underground complex, which one hopes it will not. (I much prefer the Star Trek future where you can clone a single part, say, a spinal cord.) It would have been nice if they hadn't used the cloning aspect in all the promotional materials -- the way the film goes, it would have been a surprise. Ah well.

Set in America, in some indeterminate time after 2050 (2015? couldn't hear), the film is, or can be easily interpreted, as very anti stuff like, say, stem cell research. I'm not too comfortable with this aspect of the film. Reading between the not-so-fine lines, some people will jump on this one with a vengeance. The bad people are, for example, the ones who went out sleeping around and caught a sexual disease, for which, to cure themselves, they wish to exploit (that is, vivisect) the poor clones.

And I'll be honest -- the picture is pretty freakin manipulative. The soundtrack alone. The Holocaust allusions. The ""birth"" scene. (Aw! I'm still going ""Aw!"" There is thumbsucking! It's heartbreaking! Not to mention the literal, no-quotes birth scene, which I still don't get -- morality aside, the system going on in this world seems incredibly wasteful.) Much use of ""God"" and ""playing God"" references. The aforementioned this-sort-of-thing-is-for-sex-fiends, or ""only the richest, sexiest people would do such a thing."" Funny how Hollywood always seems to make being rich a moral defect, when the people involved in filmmaking, the people at the creative-decision level... well, you see where I'm going with this.

Another English-accented villain. Why do Britons agree to keep playing these roles? I still have a theory that in many (most) cases, this is not meant as an insult from Americans to Brits, but an attempt to make villains seem more intelligent, and therefore more sympathetic -- it gives them a certain amount of ""levels.""  But the more I see it, the more I'm finding it... just lazy. Like a code, instead of character development.  C'mon, Sean Bean, I know you can do ""decent guy""!

It's an action film, and as that's not my thing at all, I could have done with a lot less of it. (I'm being led to understand that this is Michael Bay's trademark.  He should stop. Holy overkill.) It's also a longer film than I expected (I think it might have gone up to two hours if not a little more). And because so much of that length is action -- I mean, car chases and fire and crashing and building bits falling down, jeeze -- it is extremely exhausting. And makes me think of terrorism, not escapism.

And of course, if you can't suspend your disbelief you should be watching something else, probably on the History Channel. Definitely of couple of ""why the heck would they do that??"" and ""oh please, that would never work"" and ""go back inside the door!!"" moments. The humor is good though -- sprinkled throughout, just enough to be comic ""relief"" and not corny or overkill, and not enough to overpower the overall dark tone of the film. Restraint was exercised, in this aspect at least.

Oh -- and does Steve Buscemi survive any of his films? Ever? I'm just saying.

Visually this thing is fantastic. It's not ""Hero"" -- but it's not trying to do the same thing. ""Hero"" was artistic and pretty, and can be appreciated on the small screen (although 1. the big screen is of course better and 2. the small screen more and more means huge flat-screen home-theater affairs in the basement, so it's moot). There is little point in watching ""The Island"" on a small screen, I don't think. Even on a big-screen TV, I doubt I'd have enjoyed it as much. (Enjoyed is an odd word, as the film is pretty much totally disturbing.)

A lot of nice attention to detail too. Love the futuristic transports, and also how everything is not futuristic -- there is a blend of past (our present) and present (our future), much like the blend of past and present we have nowadays in our architecture and so on that we take for granted.

And... Neelix!!!

What we have here is kind of a more-straightforward, modernized update of ""Logan's Run,"" crossed a bit with ""Soylent Green"" -- but not too derivative of either. There was room for improvement, but considering I was expecting unadulterated crap, I was extremely, pleasantly surprised.

Is it redundant to say ""modernized update""?",1130544000,,5313,4.69247311827957

At first it might seem like an improbable scenario, but Hollywood has been noted to foresee events before (e.g. Wag the Dog-instead of Albania it was Yugoslavia, The Day after Tomorrow-instead of ice it's hurricanes, Deep Impact-instead of a tidal wave hitting the USA it hits Indonesia and Sri Lanka, Outbreak-instead of the Ebola-like virus it's SARS and/or the bird flu, etc).

Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The first half of the movie is really good, but the second half is a bit of a disappointment with its unnecessary and extremely long car chases and explosions.

In addition the whole escape sequence from the facility was rather unrealistic even for a sci-fi movie.

Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.

850508,2,6304328583,"Michael Bay's ""The Island"" was the whipping boy for the disastrous summer movie season that was 2005. Filled with lots of action and talented actors in the form of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen  the filmed promised to be a huge event film but winded up being a box office bomb. The reason easily is the story.

Others have elaborated on the story here so I need not give another summary. What I did feel while watching this film was that whoever wrote the script borrowed heavily from ""logan's Run"" and 80's thriller ""Coma"" with just a dash of Lucas'""THX"" to create a convoluted, heavy-handed, cheesy hollywood mess about the dangers of cloning and the individual.

The actors gave it their best to save this film and Michael Bay blew up everything to get the male audience in the seats. In the end though ""The Island"" deserved to be the summer's movie whipping boy because it exemplifies why people didn't go that much this summer- we've seen the story (done better) before.",1130457600,,982,4.6976744186046515
850509,3,6304328583,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.  First and foremost, the concept is sound. The idea that any potential cloned beings have human rights-life, liberty, property, self-determination, etc.-is a dark horse hot topic. We need to settle this issue right now before Brigitte Boisselier and the Raelians hold another press conference.

The main problem with this film is the execution.  It looks too much like ""THX-1138"" with hair, and feels too much like ""Logan's Run"" on bullet bikes.  It seemed like I was watching a rerun, even to the point of seeing the commercials.

This brings me to my second point: product placement. This film wins this year's ""MAC and Me"" award for the most obvious, annoying, distracting, and ham-handed product placement.

Product placement is distracting because it is so obvious.  It does not fit in the flow and theme of the movies, and it destroys the Hollywood Magic and Illusion.  It is a crass commercial sell out, and it insults the viewers.  We are seeing a film about human rights, and they want to make a buck off of Puma Tennis Shoes.

The worst offence is the scene with Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream.  It has no logical connection with the first hour and a half of the previous movie.  Lincoln and Jordan are on the run form the compound and the government assassin, hunkering down in Tom's house, and then we jump to Jordan giving out free Ben and Jerry's Subversive Ice Cream to Children. I felt like I was watching a Mormon ""Family Night"" Advertisement in the middle of a high-tension film.  Blech!

Yes, it alerts the government assassin to their location, so it furthers the plot. But couldn't it have been done another way, and without the obvious advertising.

Another distraction was the gag with the costumes in McCord's closet.  Yeah, we get the humor about what people do behind closed doors, and in the privacy of their own home. However, it was not humor, which involves moral irony, but a mindless gag. Once again people, we are watching a movie about human rights, not Beavis and I-don't-know-what-Head.

The ""ahem"" scene was another area that could be improved.  As it was presented, it was just another form of product placement.

This movie is salvageable, however.  It is a sound concept, but with a flawed execution.  I suggest the writers and director have a six hour ""Twilight Zone"" marathon, with four episodes of ""Night Gallery"" thrown in for variety.  If they rethink their execution, they could re-release this film in another form, and recoup their losses.",1130112000,4,2522,4.82983682983683
850510,5,6304328583,"This movie would have been a masterpiece if ""Logans Run"" and of course, ""Clonus"" was never made. This movie was stolen right from those films ideas! It was just a lot better thanks to new computers.

The writer had a brilliant idea for the plot and it made me think if someday something like this could possibly happen! Humans are cloned and grown, much faster than a normal human of course. The reason is so if anything would happen to the people who paid for the clones, they could take any part from them!

For what the clones know, the world ended and they were lucky enough to be saved. They even find more ""survivors"" every day too. They live in a huge building, their shelter from the poisonous air outside of their sanctuary.

The clones have a ""lottery"" that ""randomly"" selects lucky people to go to ""the island""..sorry for the quotations. When they do they get to go to the last paradise on earth. In reality their being sliced up for one of the clones owner...say they needed a new heart. They even brutally do it without even numbing them sometimes!

So the escape begins with two induviduals! Also, they will find out that they like to touch eachother, which they were required to keep their perimeter before!

850532,4,6304328583,"I agree this movie didn't receive the promotion and good reviews it deserved and I think I know why.  Hollywood loves an action film and Michael Bay certainly delivered the action.  Almost mind-numbingly so.  But between the scenes of mayhem, the movie quietly addressed some profound issues about human life.  Slavery, abortion, eugenics, stem cell and other human genetic research, the Holocaust, almost any subject that deals with the questions of when is something (or someone) alive? when is it considered human? when does it deserve to continue? and, most importantly, who gets to decide?  The ending was decidedly, for lack of a better term, PRO-life.  By that I mean it came out on the side of ""when in doubt, err on the side of life.""  (And I enjoyed the ""Lincoln freeing the slaves"" metaphor of the ending.)

Hollywood may love action and mayhem but its postmodernist worldview is definitely NOT pro-life.  To sacrifice the weak and helpless so that the strong can live longer or better or without complications is something that has become accepted without thought and Hollywood bears some responsibility for this.  Movies and television are the primary medium for storytelling for our time.  It is able to shape and pass on worldviews the way storytelling has for millenia.  Perhaps even more powerfully because of the technology, music and popularity of the stars.  Because of this, I think movies that ask questions and at least attempt give both sides of an argument, which The Island did reasonably well, can help us to think long and hard about what we are doing, what we believe and why we believe it.

Hollywood usually only gives one side or so stacks the deck in favor of one side as to make it inevitable that we will accept the worldview they want to promote.  I happened to see The Island the same week I rented Million Dollar Baby. MDB stacks the deck so powerfully in favor of the one side that it manipulates the viewer emotionally into accepting one character killing another character as a good thing. Even though I recognized what the filmmakers were doing, my emotions were still effected.  Seeing the two movies within days of each other was quite a contrast.

Hollywood will still make movies from the postmodernist worldview, and I'll even enjoy many of them.  But it's refreshing to have movies that present the other side of the issues in an entertaining and respectful manner.  I hope that we will see more movies with the worldview of The Island and that those of us who share that worldview will make a point to go out and see them.",1129680000,8,2571,4.776018099547511

Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but it is fun and exciting, and makes you think about some very relevant social issues.  The movie is definitely science fiction and action, and will probably appeal most to fans of these kinds of movies.

""The Island"" is set a mere 15 years in the future, and it addresses a currently hot social (or is it politcal?) issue. (Spoiler alert). The main characters in the movie, (played with exquisite sexiness by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson) are clones, created for one purpose: to provide replacement body parts for their originals. (End spoiler).

The male, known as Lincoln Six Echo, is the focus of the movie. It is his mind that opens the movie, and forces the rest of the plot. Lincoln is dissatisfied with his life in a sterile underground institution. He and his fellows are told that they are lucky to be alive; that they are the sole survivors of a cataclysmic event that has poisoned the outside world, forcing them all to live in this underground facility. The goal in life of all good inhabitants of the facility is to win ""the Lottery."" Winning the Lottery means that the person gets to travel to ""The island,"" the last remaining toxin-free paradise on upper earth.

About the time that his good friend Jordan Two Delta (Johannson) wins the Lottery, Lincoln discovers that the real world and their place in it is disasterously different than they have been led to believe. Science fiction meets action when Lincoln begins to take control of his own life, and to help Jordan do likewise.

Lincoln and Jordan are fascinating and unique characters because they are incredibly nave. Avoiding more spoilers, take my word for it that they have good reason to be nave. This is interesting because it allows the characters to face simpler issues without dumbing down the movie. For instance, Lincoln is not allowed to have bacon for breakfast, and can't understand why. The audience knows why and can identify with his very real confusion, but they don't have to get all serious and deal with complex emotional issues.

It's easy to find things to criticize about ""The Island."" There are numerous plot holes, rampant product placement, and so much more the movie could have done. Yet it is still a good movie.  It's fun to discuss the plot holes and could-have-beens with your friends, especially for those of us who are interested in how movies are produced.  Whether or not you mind the product placement is, I guess, a matter of taste.  Personally, I've never been bothered by product placement; I usually don't even notice it.

For the intellectual among us, ""The Island"" offers lots of fodder for discussion.  For fans of science fiction and action, it is a worthy contribution to these genres.",1129248000,5,2824,4.788065843621399
850536,4,6304328583,"While this is certainly no masterpiece, THE ISLAND did provide two hours of entertaining, preposterous noise...it was fun.  If someone was hoping for or expecting more from it, I guess you've never seen the previews or any other movies by Michael Bay...cuz his movies are either fast moving, overblown, ridiculous and boring (PEARL HARBOR) or fast moving, overblown, ridiculous and kinda amusing (BAD BOYS).  None are art...none will be remembered for long.

But on its own terms, there are many things to recommend this film.  The premise is the best part:  clones are raised as replacement parts for the rich people who can afford to have them manufactured.  For reasons the movie only barely explains, the clones have to live full, sentient lives or they are no good as doners...so the fabulously wealthy and very villainous company that owns the clones invents a complex ""futuristic"" society where everyone dresses the same, does mundane work and is pretty much forbidden to ask questions.  Their only reason for living is to win the lottery and a free trip to live on ""The Island,"" the only uncontaminated outside environment left in the world.  Naturally, the winner of a trip to the island is actually winning a one way ticket to euthanasia, so their organs can be harvested.  This is not a new idea, exactly, but the life in this society is actually portrayed in a fun, original and enjoyable manner.  We know...because we've seen similar stories before...that there is no Island.  But we enjoy seeing these nave humans running around with no real purpose.  It's a ""Brave New World"" kinda place.

The movie also has an appealing cast going for it.  Ewan MacGregor plays Lincoln, the clone who discovers the secret.  He's just really a likeable, personable actor and he's good a being squeaky-clean and nave.  He's good at playing an ""innocent"" and his outrage when the innocence is lost is fun too.  If a more ""hard-boiled"" performer had been cast...more of a typical action star...we would not have enjoyed his discoveries nearly as much.

I admit I was worried about the idea of Scarlett Johanssen in this film.  Sometimes she is just SO still and quiet and introverted that she can be a bit dull.  But she puts on a little bit of ""perky"" personality, and her placid face works well for the type of character she's supposed to be...something of a blank.  When she gets to ""escape"" and toughen up a bit, she makes it credible enough that I never thought ""she was the wrong choice.""

Sean Bean is the main villain, and he could do this character in his sleep...but that doesn't mean he isn't good at it.  Djomon Honsou (from AMISTAD and IN AMERICA) plays a bounty-hunter type character.  It's a nothing role...I mean really nothing...but he has a great screen presence.  Michael Clark Duncan (THE GREEN MILE) has a small but very effective part.

There are bad things too.  There is one spectacular highway car chase where Lincoln starts throwing heavy old train tires off a truck onto the highway, where they bounce and spin and crash spectacularly into the chasing cars.  But the scene is VERY much like Bay's scene in BAD BOYS II when boats are thrown off the back of a truck into the chasing cars behind.  For so much time and expense, you'd think he could have done something more original.

The movie has no real surprises either.  It's fun for awhile to know more than the clones do...but towards the end we realize that we have no surprises in store...it's just a lot of noise and explosions.  There is no real emotional payoff in the movie...and no Michael Bay film ever has any.  They are so fraught with explosions, over-edited and so poorly written that we never CARE about anyone.  Thank goodness MacGregor is likeable enough on his own to carry his part without the help of a good script.

But overall, I still recommend the movie if you go into it with appropriate expectations.  It is escapist fun.  Nothing else.  As such, you should enjoy it.",1128470400,,3968,4.747076023391813

Not so good, not so bad.

There is a thoughtful set-up for the movie.  A lot of big and little details are handled well, and in detail.  There was an attempt here to make more than just an action movie.

The two main actors do well with the material they're handed.

The plot is a little predictable: figure out the setup, grab the girl and escape, and then run-run-run while trying to get a better handle on the situation.

However, it's a Michael Bay movie.  There's his typical directing style, which he brings as baggage to every movie he directs.  Which means...he's got a terrific eye for cinematography and colour, and you could stop any scene at any time, and remark to yourself that it looks great, even artistic.  Let the film, run, though, and it's choppy action, running from scene to scene without a pause for thought.

Unlike the ""worst romance of all time"" in Star Wars Episode 2 & 3, I really felt for the lead characters played by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson because of their child-like innocence. The simple love between them is unlike anything you will see in a typical Hollywood film. The plot is complex and intelligent and addresses many moral issues of our day without being heavy-handed.

I truly admire Ewan McGregor's abilities as an actor. He is one of the smoothest and suavest actors of our time. I also like Ewan McGregor because we are both 34 years old and he is Scottish. My Great-Great Grandfather, David Lindsay, emmigrated from Scotland in the late 1800s.

If you liked Logan's Run you will absolutely love this movie. The Island is what Logan's Run should have been and is filled with many echoes from the former film. It also has shades of The Matrix and Blade Runner.

The supporting cast is excellent which includes Sean Bean from Lord of The Rings and Ethan Phillips from Star Trek Voyager. I've not seen a film with such a large supporting cast in quite some time and they all make significant contributions to the story.

This is an intelligent movie for intelligent movie-goers. It has many transcendent and emotionally powerful moments, both joyful and sad. If you just want to go on a roller coaster ride go see War of The Worlds. If you want to see a movie that will make you think about where our society may be headed, and still includes a great roller coaster ride, go see The Island.",1126310400,2,1589,4.624113475177305

 I found it to my surprise that me and my friends really ejoyed this film which is a big budget film, with great directing, suspence, action and a satisfying story. Its not perfect but the creator respects his own movie and if not for the theaters it is definetely for the dvd.

850598,1,6304328583,"Michael Bay's so called ""talent"" is being able to make cheesy, conventinal, pump-action, predictable ""films"" for 12 year old bored suburban boys. No matter what trouble his characters get into, they're always pretty and unbruised, and for goodness sake man, you can predict his endings to such a degree that it gets redundant at some point to even watch the previews, they give away the whole plot, whatever that's worth in a Bay film.

Example:

I'm Michael and I'm lookin' for the next summer box-office flick. So I find a studio and make them give me a script, the script I receive is the compelling story of a terrorist organization that captured governor's Island and are threatening to blow it up unless...whatever. The bad guy also happens to be the good guy's best friend. So the good guy gets to governor's Island, kills everyone, there's a huge fight, explosions, and a love story with a beatiful young, large breasted woman, the conclusion of this 2 hour epic? He kissed the young blonde, saved the world, which was obvious from beginning.

The Island only made 12 million dollars it's opening week in the USA. Michael Bay throws together a bunch of car chases and edits them as if they are all part of a TV commercial. He can't stay on a subject for more than 7 seconds without cutting. His movies are so monopaced because of that and so boring. The majority of people don't like his films but because of teenagers who have more disposable income (no rent for most of them), he keeps making money. Michael Bay is pretty bad. I never understood how people use the blanket term ""entertaining"" to cover films that lack of logical storylines, coherent plots, well developed characters that you can care about, emotional content, etc. Just throw in the formulaic one liners, big explosions, cheesy dialogue and lots of people getting killed and that makes ""entertainment""? That just doesn't cut it for me. The only Michael Bay movie I really liked was The Rock - everything else was horrible. By the middle of Armaggeddon, I wanted to put an axe through the TV. Might as well skip the movies and watch WWE Monday nights - it's just as entertaining and you save the $10 on the ticket.

Anyway, enough about Michael Bay. ""The Island"" is becoming a huge disaster at the box office. It's opening day take was $4.2 Million. That is pretty damn bad for a big budget summer movie.

How can someone enjoy this film? You'll have to leave your brain at the door, which, for some (such as myself), is the only way to enjoy a Bay movie. Bay movies, to be honest, don't require you to think. Sure, for most of the brain-dead clowny kids of today, that's terrific, which is how Bay's films rank in the big bucks. If Bay continues to make films like he usually does, he's sure to have money in his pocket always, supplied mostly by males in the 18-25 age demographic. This is the age bracket that frequents theaters nationwide, and these are usually the films that they pay to see. Yes, teens are a very powerful market in regards to Hollywood. The movie industry puts their power into a genre depending on the subject's popularity. They aren't going to put a lot of focus into a romance piece if shoot-em-up, hip-hopping action is the trend at the time. It's pretty sad.

I give The Island 1 out of 5 stars. Definitely not recommended.",1125619200,2,3328,4.622673434856176

That being said, this is one of the worst movies of the year.  ""Damn, the story is falling apart.....I've got it!  Guns!  Motorcycles!  Motorcycles that fly!  Yeah!""  A lot of this movie is completely stupid and obviously just there because Michael Bay is one of the worst directors on the planet.  The worst part is that the story is kind of interesting, and a real director could have made a good movie instead of this boring waste of hours.  The plot changes constantly.  There are pointless inconsistencies throughout the movie.  For example, at one point they say all people with the name ""Echo"" have been there 3 years (or something like that), but earlier one of the Echos had said he'd been there for 7.  At one point, Ewan gets through a door with no problem.  Later, the door is locked and he can't break in even with a gun.  The SAME DOOR. WHY?  Because the movie is stupid.  Another horrible thing is that they give away the twist....IN THE PREVIEW.  That's right, they use the main twist in the film in the preview to get you interested, and then show the movie as if you didn't know.  It builds up to tell you what you already know!

Don't waste two hours of your life if you're even remotely intelligent and can see the tons of stupid things wrong with this movie.  If you're a mindless action fan, go see it.  Everything about this movie just sucks.  A net saves them from falling 70 stories.  Yeah, because that's what would happen in real life.  Oh wait.  Also, they show you Michael Clarke Duncan to make you think it'll be good, and use him in a role any other extra in the world could have done just as well for the one or two scenes he's in.

850603,4,6304328583,"Don't get me wrong. The Island is as stark a reminder as any of Hollywood's target demographic, teenagers, but it takes an intriguing premise based on the ethics of stem cell research and sets up a clever ruse of a human assembly line in the not very distant future.

We open with squeaky-clean hordes in their white jogging suits (and matching Puma shoes; the marketing machine behind this movie could do with a lesson in subtlety) as they carry lipstick traces of a whole array of movies from years past -- Gattaca, Logan's Run, 1984, The Matrix series, a healthy mix of Star Wars episodes -- and bustle around in icy, postmodern vistas.

Except for this one inevitable outlier who begins to, oh no, wonder, ask pesky questions of his surroundings. The techno bunkum is semi-believable but then my popcorn was impeccably salted.

And then, boom! We kick into full throttle as the snazzy posters had screamed. The CGI team earns its keep, some of the action is superbly executed, even if the camerawork is needlessly jerky. Certain road chase sequences for instance are reminiscent of Matrix Reloaded from very recent memory, but Matrix had handled it with a poise that didn't leave my pupils somersaulting. The bikes are cooler on the Island though.

As airheaded as the plot twists are (an aberrant scientist who befriends one of the clones in the dungeons and ultimately....no, watch it yourself) they add a dash of humor to the proceedings. Much of this comic respite comes from Steve Buscemi and his goofball nonchalance, pitting human follies against the impish innocence of these machin..er..CC humans. Scarlet Johannsen looks Nivea soft when appropriate but oh can those legs run and clamber! Ewan McGregor hardly conjures up images of an action superstar but his pimple-forehead charm is infectious.

Sadly, with all this going for it, the last quarter falls prey to some dopey chase sequences and a hail of product placements (MSN, Nokia, Puma, Chrysler...long winding list). Then there are sudden exalted messages of slavery that build into an unsatisfying segue - one of our clone buddies was a US president's lookalike, what happened to these freed folks?

Well, as they say, suspend your disbelief, leave your Oscar hat at home, lean back with a big cup of Coke, no ice.

If you didn't know ""The Island"" wasn't real, this movie would have such a more powerful impact. Now the other problem isn't really bad, the movie works well, but it feels like two different pictures. I enjoyed the first half of this fim, very very much. It's mysterious, enthrawling and the dialogue is satisfying. Then, in the second half of the film, it turns a completley around and turns into a firy action film. The action is very good, but going from a complex scifi morality issue to minor car chases and exploding buildings leaves a person scratching their heads.

First of all, the movie is chock full of products. I would hope V8 Chrysler Hemis will not be on the streets 5 decades from today. I could watch the movie another time, just to count the number of products; could easily be a hundred.

Second of all, it is Michael Bay movie, director of such testosterone-intoxicated wonders as Bad Boy I and II, so expect to see buff, emotionless villains, loud explosions and huge metal things such as trucks and train wheels doing pirouettes on the highway.

Having said that, there is much to recommend, since I like big intelligent SCI-FI thrillers. Good sci-fi is usually a meditation on contemporary ethical issues, in this case, it is a warning about the seamier side of cloning. This movie is the story of a farm in which the clones of rich people are grown and maintained. Harvesting the organs of intelligent, fully sentient clones of oneself in order to prolong one's life is merely an extension of the history of human beings using other human beings as things for gratification and economic exploitation.

When watching this at the cinema, audience members kept walking in and out all of the time, as if restless. I felt a little restless too. The pace was a little too slow, and overall the movie did not live up to its potential based on the premise.

There are some nice moments like when the American clone played by Scottish actor Ewan McGregor does a bad attempt at a Scottish accent. Another interesting moment is when the clone played by Scarlett Johansson sees herself in a commercial- that same commercial is what I've been seeing in previews for the past few months featuring Scarlett Johansson. Confused? When you see it you'll know what I mean. And for Star Trek fans, watch out for Ethan Phillips (Neelix in Star Trek Voyager) in a major  supporting role.

The Island definitely has director Michael Bay's signature on it. As well as the typical explosions, I saw some camera shots that looked very similar to Armageddon in composition. Our lead actors do a fine job but I sense that they weren't given much to work with when it came to the writing and directing. The ending seems like it was aimed to be very powerful, but because of the rough journey getting there, it does not achieve its aim.

It've done me good that I've a momentary lapse of memory about this when I went to see the film last night.

Peculiarly it opens much too similarly with the set up and all the conceptual contexts of George Lucas' first flick and short project film THX1138 (which coincidentally I've just recentl;y purchased along with Michael Todd's AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS (and on another note having bought also quite only recently Pearl Jam's Mike McReady's side project with other band members from other bands called THE ROCKFORDS (which featured HEART (now LOVEMONGERS)'s Nancy Wilson (said to be one of the most dangerous wimmen along with Imelda Marcos accd to MotorCity Madman Ted Nuge(nt)(see all the thematical synchronicities?)))) have in their album's last track a song called 'Island' which lingered over and over in my head for days now); Part Gatacca and BLADE RUNNER- the movie also incorporated some parts on its set up of the year 2031(?) much similar with the likes of METROPOLIS ( a flick i found out's again missed by me as shown just last week hacked with a lokal band as such) or FUTURAMA for that matter. Plotwise our hero, the guy who played young Kenobi went into a similar process of gradually finding/witnessing out about the truth behind their so-called decontamination confinement, much like when Heston underwent to find out what SOYLENT GREEN (the movie title)- a bisquit essential to contain enough of the required nutrients for the starving masses of the future- are made out of.

Just watched the flick last night on my way to a nightshift's work. And although I nearly fell asleep by the half of it- yep that escape scene with Ewan's character's found out love interest played by Scarlett Johansson - which commmences after the first half of the entire film's duration quite on the way throughout the rest of the film - I still comprehended it somehow..
I think its just a hard thing to pin down about the movie, other than how it is that the Futuristic LAPD are depicted to've find it hard and even unattainable to capture two naivette clonies despite all of their heavy artillery and high technological armaments, (that I guess which only depicted how stupid these LA Cops and SWAT teams are in the film); which all along , the truck where Ewan and his girlfriend character hopped on a truck full of metal carriage that they found as their means for escape from these ants of chasing military people seems so hard to be convincing that with all of the racket going on about - how come the truck driver never found the idea to stop?? Perhaps the driver is so saturated on headphones with the music of the Steve Miller band while driving on his shades with a dark glassed front for a truck!

The other great Clone fiction that there is IS the Spiderman Clone saga that began in the seventies and welled its way by '96 - which according to what i heard have folded disasterously like the franchise of DC's BATMAN movie series commenced by director Tim Burton.

There is way too much in this movie to go into detail.  You've just got to see it and enjoy being transported to the future of our world via Amerithiotech, which at first seems to be a super modernistic approach to longevity and healthcare.  But producing clones who can live as real people is beyond the stretch of my imagination.  ""Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be --- the last of life, for which the first was made, our times are in His hand."" Robert Browning.

They were grown in symbiolic wombs (water bags) and evolve into adult size doubles of the original for organ replacement or even skin grafts, allowing the sponsors to live sixty to seventy years longer -- at the cost of the clone.  One poor mother-to-be is used to produce an adopted baby serving as surrogate mother andis thusly euthenized.  She never gets to hold 'her' baby, but the real parents take 'their' baby home.  ""Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.""

The Sarah Jordon clone gets to see her 'son' on the picture phone out in L. A.  That place is truly fantastic with antennea on all the buildings like the batman building in Nashville. The L. A. Metro undergraound garage looks exactly like the stage portal in the Tennessee Theatre here.

There was a real Tom Lincoln and the Scotland billionnaire takes the place of Lincoln 6 Echo in his V12 08 Caddy like an MG, only bigger.  There is no island, it is an underground bunker out in the desert of California along Route 39W.  This is the original body farm, to the higgest bidder.  Even the President of the United States has a clone just waiting.  The good actor who was so perfect in ""The Green Mile"" played Starkweather whose liver was taken -- after a fight for his life.

In a way, this was a lot like the movie, ""NO Escape,"" with the beautiful Rock of Gilbratar as an entranceway along the water in the dreams of Echo.  They encounter a rattlesnake, a truly scary scene in the long, long movie.  This was considered to be the HOly Grail of Science, but was more like the concentration camps in Germany with the attempted mass extinction of the defective clones.  The chicanery, wits, bravery and ability to think made these two special when they came out of Silo 3 to see the beautiful Earth for the first time.

The chase across the bridge was 'something to see.'  And surviving the fall of the Big ""R"" sign from seventy stories high was a trip as they were caught in the net.  The main theme is that people will do anything to survive and to live longer.

Sure, it is entirely possible that in the year 2016 we will be cloning people. What isn't possible is much of the high tech equipment that is used throughout the movie. From the bio-sensors that can tell you if there's something wrong with your urine to the extravagant desk-like computer screens operated by a crystal pyramid, the technology is much too advanced for only 14 years in the future. And even with all this effort put into it, the technologiccal endeavors are only to be ruined by the later scenes in the movie where cars are seen on the streets. The cars are not futuristic - they are present-day models of cars already available to the public (with the acception of Tom Lincoln's Cadillac).

In my honest opinion, this movie has a great idea which has been massacred by the flashiness of advertising and trying to sell the idea to various audiences. Sure, not many teenagers would be keen to seeing a movie with very little action, but let's try to be realistic, eh?

850711,4,6304328583,"""The Island"" is the only box-office disaster of director Michael Bay's career.  It's also his best film.

It includes all the Bay cinematic standards - dramatic slow-motions, incoherent close-ups of screaming faces, camera swishes and pans, a Eurotrash villain, a carnage-ridden car chase. And yet it works this time - the script isn't completely stupid or amoral, like the ""Bad Boys"" series, and Bay has found a movie where he doesn't have the need to endlessly objectify women.

Unlike Steven Spielberg's ""Artificial Intelligence"" or ""Minority Report,"" ""The Island"" isn't precisely a thinkpiece. It's more thoughtful than a superhero movie, though. ""Batman Begins,"" for its many strengths, is ultimately forgettable. ""The Island"" will have a little more staying power with me.

The movie opens in the near future, at a giant complex housing the last living humans to survive the nuclear contamination outside, although, strangely, they keep finding survivors. The people work on assembly lines injecting vitamins into tubes leading through the walls. Then - who knows where they go?

All of the workers await their invitation to the island, the last remaining contamination free zone in the world.

One of the survivors, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has questions. Why must he always wear white? Why can't he have bacon at breakfast instead of oatmeal? Why isn't he allowed to have ""too much proximity"" to women, specifically Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson). What are these dreams he has of a boat? And dreams he has of being strangled?

There are answers, and they involve the real nature of the ""people"" living in the complex: They're clones waiting to be used by their owners out in the real world, should they ever need them. The owners have been told by the doctor (Sean Bean) who runs the complex the clones live in amniotic fluid, and never reach consciousness. But when their organs were harvested, they failed. Thus the clones must eat, breathe, run around, live. Thus the illusion. An invite to the island is really the clone's death, revealed in a graphic scene involving a recent winner (Michael Clarke Duncan) whose liver is needed for his football-star owner in the real world.

Lincoln Six Echo finds out, hatches an escape with Jordan Two Delta, and the second act of ""The Island"" shifts into a action movie, about 45 minutes of top-shelf mayhem.  The car chase involves a bounty hunter (Djimon Hounsou) and his crew,  a semi truck, an armored truck, about  ten futuristic Pontiacs and two hovercraft motorcycles out of ""Return of the Jedi."" It's the best of its kind since ""The Matrix Reloaded."" Act three involves finding the owner of Lincoln Six Echo, also played by McGregor, and returning to the underground complex.

The logic of ""The Island"" is a bit creaky - given what we know about the clones at the end of the film, it seems unlikely that just one would have his doubts about the whole system. Mixing the genders seems pointless, too - since it's unimportant for to mix for medical purposes. But you can deconstruct most science fiction flicks. ""The Island"" passes the essential action test: Does it work in the moment? Is it cool? Is it loud and burly? Does it have a little bit of humor?

McGregor and Johansson - who has never and probably never will again look this good - aren't A-list stars, and that may have dimmed the box office returns, but they make the transition from mildly content clones to fear-for-their-life to passionate rebels about as well as could be expected. Bean is appropriately smarmy and English and Hounsou, tabbed to be cooler than everyone in the movie, is.

Bay shows what, for Bay, is restraint. After the absolute nightmare that was ""Bad Boys II"" - that nihilistic, racist junk made $200 million - and the equally brutal, Bay-produced ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" this is a surprise. And, given the returns, a disappointment. That ""The Island"" fell flat with critics proves some of them are getting a little tough to please; that it fell flat with audiences proves there is something the 2005 moviegoing water.",1123113600,4,4086,4.937317784256559

850713,4,6304328583,"This is a spoiler-free review of 'The Island'.

'The Island' is a fun, fast-paced riff around the mid-1970s science fiction film 'Logan's Run'. The premises are almost identical - a group of people who believe they live in a seclused artificial 'paradise' for their own safety are actually being controlled by an Orwellian bureaucracy. This isn't a straightahead remake of the earlier film; instead director Michael Bay revisits aspects of the original movie and then introduces more contemporary ideas. I prefer movies that are 'inspired' by classic films to straightforward remakes,and 'The Island' is no exception.

On the positive side is the chemistry between both Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johannson. They're attractive leads who make a believable couple, and they nicely capture the naive essence of characters raised in seclusion all their lives. It's a pleasure to see a film where the romantic leads actually seem interested in one another, rather than being tossed together as the result of 'high concept' casting. There are also a few scattered scenes with Steve Buscemi, and fans of Buscemi's bug-eyed weasel persona are going to enjoy his too-brief appearance. The plot moves along nicely, and while much if it will be formulaic to almost any frequent movie-goer, it certainly works well most of the time.

On the negative side - this is a Michael Bay movie. If you didn't like his over-the-top style, you won't like this. This includes some far-fetched stuntwork. And if you're hoping for a cerebral examination of the morality of cloning and related research, you'd better leave the theater and open an introductory biology textbook because this film sure isn't going to provide it.

I go to the movies at least twice a month every summer, and 'The Island' is one of the best times I've had all year at the movies. It's a good, though not great, movie that you probably were discouraged from seeing from its awful advertising campaign. Give it a try, or rent it when it's on video. You just might be surprised at this one.",1122940800,,2038,4.967741935483871
850714,5,6304328583,"This film succeeds on several levels.  First, it is a fun film to watch.  The plot is interesting and action-filled.  Without looking for a deeper meaning, the viewer can enjoy this high quality production at its face value.

The actors were well cast and performed their roles well.  Ewan McGreggor, who's performances have been up and down in the past, gives an outstanding performance in the lead role.  Scarlett Johansson comes across well, but her character doesn't have the same level of depth as his.  Still, she displays a lot of charisma and really fits the role.  Steve Buscemi plays the same character he always does, and it works.  Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou also give excellent performances.

The action scenes, although good, are about par for the course in today's world.

Where the film really scores is in the underlying theme of the movie, which questions wisdom of creating, de-humanizing, then destoying human life just to serve other human life.  Obviously cloning comes to mind, but stem cell research and abortion also fit into this picture.

We see Sean Bean, who is so concerned about his own life and wealth, that he convinces himself that it is OK to murder other humans.  How does he convince himself?  By doing what other humans have done since the beginning of time: he first dehumanizes them in his mind.  This has been accomplished in the past by calling a particular religious group ""vermin"" over and over until someone actually belives it.  Or, you can call a baby a fetus, so you can convince yourself that it is merely being removed, not murdered.  De-humanization doesn't always lead to murder; otherwise fine Americans once owned slaves because they convinced themselves that black humans aren't real humans.  ""The Island"" does a good job of showing that once you dehumanize someone, it's OK to kill them, even if you're doing so just to keep your receptionist job (like the two ladies talking with the helicopter pilots).

Another hidden theme in the film is that even if society realizes what is being done, society doesn't always care.  In the film the lead characters think that they'll be OK if they can just make thier plight public.  Yet they find that their sponsor doesn't care, he just wants to make sure he survives.  Also, think about all those employees like Steve Buscemi who really know whats going on.  You know that word had leaked to the outside world, yet no one was doing anything about it.  That's a disturbing thought, yet one that rings true (Ever heard of Darfur? Do you care?).

During one scene, I saw Michael Duncan Clarke's character running down a hospital corridor screaming ""I want to live!"".  It brought to mind that the unborn don't even get to express their desire to live, although they certainly have that innate desire we all have as humans.

I don't subsribe to the idea that all movies are ""art"".  Many are just films created to make a buck.  This movie definitely was art because it expresses something about our culture and decisions we are forced to make.  I heartily recommend that you view this film with others, so you can discuss the issues presented by the film.",1122854400,2,3149,4.775925925925926
850715,5,6304328583,This was a great film. The acting was decent and the plot was pretty neat. The action scenes are amazing! Michael Bay actually made a decent movie next to PEARL HARBOR. He has an eye for action and see now if you give him a plot he can actually make a movie.,1122854400,,258,3.980769230769231
850716,5,6304328583,"I was very impressed with this movie, mostly because I can't understand why so many critics bashed it, so I walked into it not really expecting much and about half-way through I thought to myself ""the critics were VERY wrong"".  I have to say, I've never been too impressed with Ewan McGregor's acting abilities, I mean, he's been decent in a few films, but this movie is the movie he was born to do...His charactor is so alive, so interesting and very well played, unlike is Obi-Wan who is just plain boring.  The plot of the film is this.  There is a facility hosting the last remaining humans after the world has been contaminated and everything has died.  SO these humans are awaiting their trip to 'THE ISLAND' whch is the last uncontaminated natural habitat and they can only win their trip to the Island via a lotery that is run each week.  Lincoln (McGregor), like everyone else is just waiting his turn, until his besst friend Jordan (Johansson) is chosen to leave for the Island.  After doing a little snooping around Lincold see's something that disturbs him enough to where he realizes that this Island is not real.  So thus he grabs Jordan before she meets her doom and they escape.  Upon hearing the truth (they are clones) from a friend McCord (Buscemi) they set on a course to find their sponsers.  They do find Lincolns sponser, Tom Lincoln and they try to attain his help to show the world what is happening in this facility, that they are creating living humans and then killing them for spare parts.  The movie is a great thrill ride, with excellent performances by McGregor and Djimon Hounsou who is really proving himself to be a great actor (see, Gladiator and the 4 Feathers).  I was a little unimpressed with Johanssons charactor but that was just a lack in writing there....she is a very talented actress and gave this her all.  I just have to say that this movie is far more than just an action film.  This movie has heart and has a great moral.  It shows that humans really will do anythin to survive, and it stresses the point that you can't trust anyone, but in the end, you realize that the people you deem least likely will be there for you 100%.  In the wise words on Miss Johansson, ""The Island is real, it's us!""",1122854400,,2246,4.511111111111111
850717,3,6304328583,"As mindless entertainment goes, ""The Island"" is pretty good.  And yes, like good science fiction, it does manage to raise some ethical questions.  However, like all of Michael Bay's movies, its ""yeah right"" factor is off the charts.  How about that scene where the scaffolding falls 100 stories and crushes everything around it, but our heroes hardly suffer a scratch?  Lucky that net just happened to be there, huh?  And it sure seemed easy for our heroes to escape the facility, given the fact that if their secret ever got out, the entire company would go under.  Why didn't the company just build a 50 foot tall electrified fence around the entire perimeter?  Better yet, why didn't they just implant all the clones with a GPS, so that they could be easily tracked down in the event that they ever escaped?

Since the company employeed regular humans to interact with the clones, how did it protect itself from whistle blowers?  Its hard to believe that at least one person wouldn't have been absolutely appalled after the first day on the job, and would have went straight to the authorities.",1122854400,2,1097,4.761904761904762
850718,5,6304328583,"Some of the reviews were so bad I felt awkward on line, like my friends would come by, see me trying to get into THE ISLAND, and jeer at me.  However, this is America and we're allowed to see any old pap we want to, so I paid my money and took a chance on this film.  I'm glad I did because this was truly a spellbinding thriller that had me on the edge of my seat a good two hours.

And yet I can see why some disliked it.  I'm of two minds about the  constant product placement.  To me it seemed to give some backing to the theory that Michael Bay, improbable as it may seem, was building a case against unbridled capitalism, by the mere thickness of the web of logos that the viewer must struggled through, like his clones have to struggle through phalanx after phalanx of black-garbed security men to find freedom.  I never really thought about it much beyond that, however, look at a book like Bret Easton Ellis' GLAMORAMA, in which much of the horror is in fact contingent on the relentless dropping of brand names, drop by drop like the so-called Chinese water torture.

Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson do just fine playing their parts.  I thought Scarlett more appealing in this film then in any other. I loved the part where Ewan approaches her, despite the limits on ""proximity"" and whispers something into her ear in a visual reminiscence of the final scene in LOST IN TRANSLATION, where Bill Murray tells her something the audience never hears, the import of which we try to guess by studying her reaction.

People are wondering why this movie didn't do better upon opening.  I think it's because it's hard to understand!  Well, if you keep at it you get it, and there are some exposition scenes later on that manage to avoid tedium, but for the first half hours I was just one big ""Huh?"" scratching my head like Elmer Fudd.  There was plenty to look at, but I can see how it would be confusing for many, and word of mouth might have suffered.  Caspian Tredwell-Owen's screenplay was miles better than his last fil;m, BEYOND BORDERS with Angelina Jolie, and I look forward to seeing what comes out of his head next.

We couldn't figure out how the women in the sector, many of whom are about to give birth, actually got pregnant!  I felt like a child again before I knew anything about sex.  How did the women understand what pregnancy was about?  I guess they were just told they had been inseminated for the good of the race.

In fact, as we walked away from the tremendous ball of excitement that is THE ISLAND, loose ends began piling around our feet ike seaweed.  Picking our way around them, we went home happy as idiots.  Haven't had as fun a time in the movies all summer.",1122681600,2,2697,4.419028340080971
850749,5,6304328583,"For anyone wanting to know where actors go after extraordinary experiences in outer space, (I thought Star Wars and Apollo 13), with eyes imploring to the stars to whisk them away to a euphoric location, or in fiery chasms to destroy all-powerful rings, they go to `The Island'.

Even though you don't arrive here by plane like co-creator J.J. Abrams TV show `Lost' suggests, I really believe J.J. Abrams is onto something fascinating when you come across this `Island'. You won't find his name in the credits or anywhere on this film. Nor will you find `Pirates Of The Caribbean'. No, you've uncovered something far more evil, that's sure to leave you reeling in terror, and your bones stone cold.

`The Island' is the perfect retreat for any movie lover, especially for die-hard fans of Ewan McGregor. This is the ULTIMATE Ewan McGregor experience! It is the movie all fans can be proud of. Every girl's dream will now consist of this film and its star. Every boy will be dreaming about the girl. You'll never have nightmares again. `The Island' has a secret and it's not what you think it is if you've seen the previews. There is an even better and bigger surprise in store for those awaiting their life-altering chance to visit `The Island'. For those unable to visit thanks to lucky numbers and random selection, I say ""Your Time Will Come"".

`The Island' is the culmination of everything Ewan has worked so hard for in his early and recent films. Recall `A Life Less Ordinary' and all the gun play and bullets flying everywhere. Ewan certainly has `A Life Less Ordinary' in this film. This movie would make Obi-Wan proud! For years since `Star Wars: Episode II he has been searching for an ""Attack Of The Clones"" and now he finally has some answers.

Since I heard Ewan wasn't particularly impressed by his film effort with Jerry Bruckheimer and his `Black Hawk Down' experience, regular director of Bruckheimer blockbusters Michael Bay, has created a pristine environment in which Ewan can relax, and really have some fun. Too bad the audience can't have as much fun thanks to a pounding soundtrack that really keeps the heart beating at a frantic death-defying pace. Any quicker and one's heart is sure to flat line.

I remember the time I saw `The X-File Movie: Fight the Future'. It was so thrilling; I would have really liked a respirator! The intensity reaches frightening levels in both films.

In such a lovely setting reminiscent to me of `Lost in Translation', in the early slow mood of the film, I'd almost expect Scarlett Johansson to go around in her underwear for most of the film. A state of undress many of us have experienced at some stage during our day to day life, but rarely if ever, admit to in public.

I had read that Scarlett really wanted to do a love scene with Ewan without a bra, and, being Ewan McGregor is part of the film, who would blame her. I think it would have been more natural without one especially in bed, but the ratings board must have really got its knickers in a knot and kept the brassiere. Still it is of little concern in the ultimate scheme of `The Island'. Scarlett Johansson, rising starlet that she is, is certain to have other more substantial opportunities to shred her clothing in the hot spotlight sun she will bake gloriously in due to this film. If that is really what she desires.

As `The Island' opens Dreamworks is one of the first images we see. Mr. Steven Spielberg is the creator of Dreamworks, but before this, Amblin Entertainment and Universal Studios roaring success `Jurassic Park', and `Jurrassic Park: The Lost World' when dinosaurs run amok. Then later the bleak futuristic thriller `Minority Report' of which `The Island' might have to tip its sunglasses to in terms of design images on tabletops or elsewhere around the room. `Minority Report' also features echoes but in a much more fascinating, totally different storyline. So even as `The Island' invites us into its warm inviting abode, we must be wary. Something out of the ordinary is afoot.

There is a well picked group of collaborators here at work, to bring `The Island' to life.

When I think of `The Island' I think of `The Beach'. Only we are on another resort here where the elements are a little more harsh, and the need to harness life and mould it like Adam and Eve of the biblical Garden of Eden is always at its most extreme stage. Imagine if you can you were denied companionship and close proximity with the opposite sex. To set your creation's mind like a clock that never goes beyond fifteen years of age. What would life hold for someone with this stunted childhood?

Think back to Ewan's `Long Way Round' experiences and watch him go for the ride of his life! He'd be more then happy to have you ride with him as long as you let him drive. It's the least an awe-struck fan could do for Ewan. He'd do the same for you if he was in the same situation.

I ask that you also remember Steve Buscemi from his time with Ewan in the lovely `Big Fish', and his overly-inviting smile in another fanciful, pristine, story-book setting. If I were you I would indeed `Plan Your Escape' to a cinema near you right now! The future is here. Keep your eyes wide. What you see is not a mirage in a desert. I only invite you to get `Lost' in the wonder and splendour of `The Island'. May 'The Island' hold everything you desire, and riches beyond your wildest dreams.

(Minor spoilers ahead)

The story centers around two clones: Lincoln 6 Echo (McGregor) and Jordan 2 Delta (Johansson) - aren't those the coolest names ever?!! - who dwell in a futuristic utopian society.  It's much like Orwell's ""1984,"" in which everything is controlled, programmed and run by an unseen force.  In this case it's a sinister doctor - masterfully played by Sean Bean - who is the ""God"" over the clones.  Now, the clones go about their daily life, oblivious to the fact that they live underground and that their entire existent is a lie.  You see, in the future, clones are grown and harvested and kept in this underground habitat.  The clones only purpose is to provide vital organs to the real people that they were cloned from.  For example, if you needed a liver transplant, they would grow a clone (which takes 12 months) and then take the healthy liver from the clone. Of course, the clone would have to be disposed of, which brings up an interesting moral dilemma of a side plot - would you take an organ from a clone of yourself to help you live?  Don't be so quick to say no!  Unfortunately, these clones have no idea that they are not real, as they have been brought up to believe that they are the survivors of a post-apocalyptic Earth.  Their only chance to leave is if they win the lottery, and they are selected to travel to 'the island' - a mythical realm which happens to be the only non-contaminated place left on Earth.

The obvious question is asked, well why didn't anyone ever figure out that their life is a lie?  The film answers this by stating that the clones are only schooled to a 9th grade education - no higher level thinking skills are ever developed. It's a rather interesting solution to the problem.

Much to the chagrin of the cloning industry, L6E discovers that the lottery isn't real, and neither is the island paradise.  This is simply just a way of taking the clone that is needed to provide their vital organs to their host.  L6E and J2D decide to escape from their environment to venture into the unknown, and thus our movie is off and running.  Sounds pretty complex for a Michael Bay film doesn't it?

Well, after the two clones are on the run the movie basically turns into one extended action scene after the next - keep an eye out for the fantastic sequence in which train wheels are dumped off a back of a truck by the clones to thwart a persuit by the agents persuing them. Eventually the clones decide to seek out their hosts, in the hopes of alerting the public to the injustice of the cloning industry.

(End minor spoilers)

I love the fact that this film makes an almost seemless transition from sci-fi film to action film back and forth.  The film slowed down when it needed to and got loud and noisy in the appropriate places.  All in all, I felt that the film was the most exciting and entertaining sci-fi film since the original ""Matrix."" I would highly recommend this to fans of sci-fi films and action pics.  In a summer of completely disappointing films - aside from the glorious return of Batman - this film is truly a refreshing surprise.  Big explosions, car chases, attractive leading stars and some distant semblance of a plot help to make this film more than the average Michael Bay film.",1122595200,143,3517,4.516587677725118
850752,3,6304328583,"It's good to know that ""Star Wars"" doesn't always kill careers.  Harrison Ford proved it years ago, and Ewan ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" McGregor is proving it now, having starred in three non-""Star Wars"" films since 1999's ""The Phantom Menace"".  However, his latest, ""The Island"", while an intriguing and almost original idea falls apart in the execution.

 Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) believes he is a survivor of an ecological disaster, living in a self-contained, white-walled world with other survivors, isolated from the contamination outside.  Everyone wears neat white track suits and has strictly regulated dietary and exercise needs.  The driving hope of everyone's life is to be randomly selected to go to The Island, the only habitable place left in the outside world.

 Lincoln is good friends (just friends; no one even thinks about sex here) with the stunning Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson), and is saddened when she is chosen to go to the Island, leaving him behind.

 But, Lincoln's curiosity and puzzlement at the strange world he lives in leads him to a horrific discovery: he and everyone he knows are merely clones, created so their organs can be harvested and given to their originals if they suffer a traumatic accident.  There is no island, only a surgical bay.

 The irony does not escape me that here Ewan McGregor is a heroic clone when the last time we saw him he was almost killed by a bunch of clones.

 The whole idea of this movie is brilliant and chilling.  However, being a Michael Bay film (director of ""Armageddon"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""The Rock"") it becomes distracted with lots of explosions and over-the-top action scenes.

 Once Lincoln escapes the underground institute with Jordan, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean, at his evil best) hires some tough mercenaries to return the escaped ""products.""  From then on, most of the movie is explosions, gun fights, car chases, and more explosions, with only a few all-to-brief moments of discovery for our two wayward clones as they find out what the real world is like.

 Surprisingly, though this film is set in the future, the real world looks a lot like ours.  Most filmmakers who make stuff set in ""the future"" overestimate how advanced we'll be.  But here, there are no flying cars and guns are still just regular guns.  There's even still product placement, and apparently MSN replaces SBC (it could happen).

 ""The Island"" takes a bit of ""Brave New World"", some of ""THX-1138"", and a dash of ""The Matrix"" to create a compelling human story about innocent clones that just want to live.  Unfortunately, this compelling human story is lost somewhere in the violent firestorm of action.  I would be the last one to say that a movie shouldn't have action scenes, but almost every summer movie has car chases and explosions; and this film had an overabundance of those at the expense of its truly interesting story.",1122595200,,2887,4.945945945945946
850753,3,6304328583,"Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) are workers in a recovering society.  They mindlessly go about their tasks for the greater good.  All this is necessary because they have been told that they are all that remains from an event that contaminated the Earth.  They are two of a few thousand that live in the compound.  All have a dream of winning a daily lottery that would give them a trip to The Island, ""nature's last remaining pathogen-free zone.""

Lincoln begins to think that The Island is not what it seems, and when his best friend Delta wins the lottery, he wisks her away to find out the secret.  Aided by a technician named McCord (Buscemi), they soon find themselves on the run from a mercenary named Laurent (Hounsou) who was hired by Merrick (Bean),the doctor that runs the compound.

""The Island"" takes an interesting idea, and executes it poorly.  Directed by Jerry Bruckheimer's long-time lackey, Michael Bay, this feels like a Bruckheimer production despite him having nothing to do with the film.  Bay has Bruckheimer's style down pat, and the less movies made in this fashion, the better.  An interesting idea is lost amongst the action and special effects.  Sure the effects are good, especially a later scene in the movie where McGregor gets to act against himself, but effects alone do not make a movie.  Bay brings the mindless moviemaking that he is known for, and that is what makes the movie less than it could be.

Bay has gone on record saying that perhaps the fault of the movie's dismal opening is due to the lack of star power in McGregor and Johansson, but they are solid actors doing the best they can with what they were given.  Buscemi is his usual quirky self as McCord, providing some chuckles.  Bean and Hounsou fill the roles of bad guys adequately.

Another large problem with the movie is that what should be a main plot twist is given away in most of the previews.  I'm sure that this is meant to make the movie seem more interesting, but when seeing the movie, this revelation lacks any punch.  The previews for ""The Island"" are prime examples of what not to do when promoting a movie.

In the end, fans of Bruckheimer-style movies will probably be satisfied.  Those looking for a little more than an interesting idea that is dumbed down for the sake of action and effects will be disappointed.",1122595200,,2362,4.673123486682809

""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" make me want to throw-up with the wishy-washy sentiments wrapped up in the flag where you just know, someone is gonna be saluting in the last scene of the film.

Well aside from that biased comment, I really do like Ewan McGregor.  Truthfully I see him doing good stuff in the ""FUTURE.""  As for his role in the movie.  He was entertaining to watch and TERRIBLY OKAY scripted.  Yes you heard right from me.  I didn't enjoy the scripting in the movie.  The dialog was good to a point.  But in all honest truth I felt this movie could have done without most of the cheesy dialog.  But I won't bore you with the negative part, because the action in the movie was very good.  It was definately candy for the eye.  So I did actually enjoy it.  The plot was very interesting too.  So interesting in fact that I'm actually thinking of going to get the book, because I feel there was probably a lot left out.  So if you really want to see a fun entertaining movie with an actual decent plot.  I say go see The Island.  It is a really enjoyable flick.

One more negative I must add that subtracted from me granting it a higher rating, because it sounds like I loved it.  Which I actually did.  But to tell you the truth.  If this movie is a sign for how companies will be doing their advertising in the future in the actual movies, then I along with quite a few others I know will no longer being spending the big bucks at the movies any more.

850756,4,6304328583,"Movie: I joke a lot about Michael Bay mostly because he's only capable of making an action film and nothing else. Don't get me wrong though, I like Michael Bay.  He made the one film that inspired me to become a filmmkaer . . . okay that sounds pathetic, let me clear that up. He directed The Rock, which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who likes to work with Media Ventures, which was started by Hans Zimmer, who composed the score to The Rock, which inspired me to become a filmmaker. There, was I able to distance myself away from Michael Bay enough? Anyways, back to The Island.  I bet a lot of people make fun of Michael Bay but the truth is that he is one of Hollywood's most successful directors.  All of his movies up to The Island have debuted in the #1 spot at the box office, and all have grossed an insane amount of money. Unfortunetly all those movies were with Jerry Bruckheimer, and The Island was his first film without the invulnerable prodocer. And guess what, it tanked horribly. The Island had an eye opening budget of $124 Million, marketing included. The movie only grossed a very saddening $12.4 Million on its opening weekend, a measley 10% of the budget.  Which to me was a surprise because The Island seemed to me like his most thought provoking movie, which isn't saying alot but it's something. The film takes place in 2019 and centers around a company that will clone you for a small price of $5 Million, that way if you ever need an organ transplant or something of that nature they will harvest it from your clone. What the company doesn't tell the public is that they have the clones living in a quarantined society, because if they were to keep them in a vegatative state then the organs would fail (oooh, Michael Bay is getting scientific). They have this ""lottery"" that the members of the society can win, which takes them to the island, the planet's last piece of ""uncontaminated"" land. Unfortunetly, in this company ""the island"" translates into ""the operating room"", where they harvest the clones for spare organs and such. The movie deals with a pretty decent point about clones and it definately relates to our science today. So all you ""pro life"" people can rejoice because Michael Bay is on your side. So, after we have the compelling Minority Report style sci-fi of the movie it takes a sharp left into Michael Bay's territory. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson escape from the building and now begins the all too familar cat and mouse game. Then we have non-stop camera cuts, slow moving low angle shots, quick jolts and jarring, a car chase that is almost identical to Bad Boys II, a slow motion stand off that ends in a slow montion shoot and fall identical to the end of Bad Boys II, a hoverbike chase that is all to similar to Minority Report's jetpack scene, lots of things blowing up into tiny pieces, and just for the hell of it we get some virgin clone love making. The movie was entertaining if not at all logical or comprehensible.  I certainly enjoyed Steve Jablonky's first action score, while it did seem reminiscent of Hans Zimmer, it also had its own distinctive style. The movie deserves more credit than what it's being given, I honestly didn't expect this movie to tank and frankly I don't think it deserves to tank. Fantastic 4 made more money than this over the opening weekend of The Island and I find that rediculous.

ACTING: Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson make a great on screen pair even though Scarlett Johansson's character adds nothing to the movie. It's all Ewan McGregor who discovers the conspiracy, escapes, and does all the work that needs to be done. Scarlett Johansson is just there so Michael Bay can be happy, and so that Steven Spielberg won't get angry at Bay for stealing his premise piece for piece.  Sean Bean plays the head of the company and does a good job in my opinion. Djimon Hounsou is a nice addition as the cliched ""tough as nails"" character who then opens up at the end. Steve Buscemi is just there because he's Steve Buscemi and I guess Michael Bay wanted him back from the Coen brothers.  Overall there is nothing to complain about in the acting department, everybody works in this movie.

BOTTOM LINE:  I think the reason why critics hate Michael Bay so much is because he tries too hard to make his action movies into something more.  That is why his movies are all around 2 1/2 hours long, and also they may hate him for all his product placement. Bad Boys II was filled up to the whazoo with product placement and so was this. I saw Microsoft (MSN, XBOX), General Motors (Cadillac, Chevy, GMC), Puma (look for the shoes), hell even a nice close up of a futuristic Aquafina bottle. Back to Bay, Pearl Harbor was the worst experiment of his because he did an even splice of half romance and half mind numbing action.  Bad Boys II and Armageddon tried too much to focus on the characters as well, while Bad Boys didn't as much.  But hey, I still enjoy popping Bad Boys II or Pearl Harbor's DTS track in just to give my surround sound system a workout.",1122422400,2,5061,4.542261251372119
850757,5,6304328583,"There has been a catastrophe; the entire planet has been contaminated and is virtually unlivable.  Survivors of the disaster must remain inside an enormous compound if they hope to live.  The situation could be worse, though.  The compound is very beautiful (if monochomatic), and every luxury is available to them.  Swimming pools, exercise rooms, computers, even fresh food.  What's more, the surviors have hope.  There exists an island which is the only place on Earth that hasn't been contaminated, and the people live in the hopes that soon, they will win the lottery and will be moved to the paradise.  For a post-apoctalyptic society, things aren't so bad.  Or are they...

Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) begins to question things when he starts having ""dreams"" that suggest everything isn't exactly as it seems.  Along with his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), they escape from the compound only to learn that not only is the world still in perfect condition, but they are clones of rich people on the outside.  People like Tom Lincoln (McGregor) and Sarah Jordan (Johansson) paid to have themselves copied so that if they ever need an organ transplant, they will automatically have a perfect donor.  The clones are viewed as products, and instead of names, they have serial numbers.  Their names include the surname of their sponsors (Lincoln), their location code (6 means that Tom Lincoln lives in LA), and their generation (Echo refers to the year in which the clone was grown).

Since this is a Michael Bay movie, one can expect there to be many explosions (and there are) as well as awesome special effects.  However, the story is just as compelling as the effects are cool.  Furthermore, the characters are fleshed out and multi-dimensional.  The movie's villain, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), who is the creator of the clone research facility, isn't an evil mastermind bent on torturing people.  He truly believes in what he is doing; he sees his job as helping people.  Granted, he refers to the clones, who are real people, as just soulles products.

Another good thing about this movie is its charm.  The clones (or agnates as the Merrick company calls them) may have adult bodies, but they are mentally at the age of 15.  So when L6E and J2D encounter real people for the first time, the results are pretty funny (I love Johansson's bubbly delivery when some lowlife in a bar asks for her number, and she responds by saying ""2 Delta"").

It is good to know that a summer blockbuster (especially one from Bay) can have heart behind it.  Hopefully, this film will set a precedent for future summer flicks.",1122422400,2,2632,4.8629213483146065
850758,2,6304328583,"Michael Bay's ""The Island"" is really two movies cobbled somewhat inexpertly together, either of which could have stood on their own as a serviceable and even entertaining picture but do not marry well at all. Whether or not you like ""The Island"" will likely depend on how much you can ignore one and focus on the other. On the one hand, the beginning of the film is a promising set-slightly-in-the-future sci-filosophy flick in the style of ""Equilibrium"" or ""A.I."" It is not very deep, but it is slick and mod and cool and has a few ideas that could be, with development, thought-provoking and relevant to our own times.

This, understandably, is not the movie Bay spends most of his time on. The other two-thirds of the film consist almost entirely (and unrelentingly) of the typical teenage testosterone-driven car chases and endless mind-numbing explosions that we have come to expect from films like ""Armageddon"" and ""Bad Boys."" I have a soft spot for stuff blowing up onscreen, particularly when it is handled well (and Bay's usually is), but after an hour and a half of constant bombardment with it, even the best, most designer mayhem becomes....merely mayhem. So many cars, trucks, planes, buildings, silos - you get the idea - explode, detonate, collapse, or otherwise are destroyed in this film that I found myself replaying the previous action sequences in my head, just to make sure I really hadn't seen that before.

In other words, over 90 minutes of a movie with a running time of 127 minutes (no action film, with the exception perhaps of ""Lord of the Rings"" or something equally huge, should ever run over two hours) is devoted to what eventually feels like one prolonged car-chase, with frequent explosions tossed in to divert us from...well, whatever remains in our salvo-shocked brains of the plot.

Which is a shame, really, as this part is actually interesting, and even thought-provoking, at least by popcorn-movie standards. In the not-too-distant future, the rich and powerful can purchase ""insurance policies"" in the form of clones. These clones, since they are produced from their ""owners'"" DNA, are exact genetic replicas of the ""real"" persons, and handy therefore should one need skin grafts, organ transplants, etc. They are kept insulated from knowledge of the outside world, which they believe has been destroyed by a ""contamination"" of almost mythic proportions: everything, that is, except one remarkable ""Island,"" which is spoken of in reverent, dulcet tones as ""the world's last remaining paradise."" The clones live a blissfully idyllic if discomfitingly sterile life in a ""facility"" dressed in shades of antiseptic white, black, and peculiar aqua that match their designer track-suits, going about routine jobs and drinking lots and lots of Aquafina. When they're not drinking Miller beer. Or Diet Coke. But I digress. Their only goal is to reach ""the Island"" someday; they are reassured in what is in retrospective a chillingly truthful manner that they all eventually will, by a ubiquitous talking poster of a cool brunette who is very reminiscent of Big Brother.

Of course, we are assured by the shady project manager Dr. Merrick (played by that remarkable standard for smoothly villainous Brits, Sean Bean) that clones, or ""agnates,""are completely safe and entirely non-""human"": they are not curious, they do not feel natural human emotions, nor are they aware of sex or much at all beyond a fifth-grade education. His protestations are of course refuted by the presence of Lincoln Six-Echo, a clone who is quite curious and borders frequently on insurgency. He is helped along in his rule-breaking by the Bay-movie staple Steve Buscemi as McCord, that omnipresent sort of seedy chief engineer who knows the ways of the world and keeps dirty pictures of girls on his walls. (There is a moment of humor when Lincoln asks McCord why his ""pretty friends"" have no clothes, and McCord hints at his underlying - albeit well-concealed - decency by being unable to answer.)

Lincoln's favorite word is why: why can he not have bacon for breakfast? Why does everyone have to wear white? Who made Tuesday tofu night? And what is tofu anyway? Innocent enough questions, perhaps, but they inevitably lead to trouble, particularly after he witnesses some truly shocking incidents in the facility's medical wing. This segment of the film comes closest to actual artistry of anything that Bay has done, particularly in one scene where a mother is taken from the facility to birth her child, and we discover in jarring horror along with Lincoln that things are not as they seem. It also asks (or seems to ask) some deep questions, particularly for summer fare: What exactly makes us human? To what extent is the preservation of the self justified? Is it possible to make ""copies"" of ourselves without giving away parts of what makes us...ourselves?

And then Bay switches gears to the Escape Picture, where Lincoln Six-Echo and his beautiful ""friend"" Jordan Two-Delta must run for their lives from the Evildoers who wish to stop them before they can tell the world the company's dirty secrets. And run they do. It is with reluctance that we leave - though it's more like being yanked away from - the antiseptic-shaded, idea-driven plot-world and are thrown headlong into a heady series of chases involving no fewer than eight separate modes of transportation, all shot in smoky reds and hazy glaring oranges and never stopping for breath. These are exhilarating at first, but in no time at all they become repetitive, and otherwise remarkable actors like Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, and Djimon Hounsou are reduced to shouting lines like ""Run!"" and ""Jump!"" and ""Get them!"" every 6.5 seconds. Johansson fares perhaps the worst: at least McGregor gets to indulge in a little high-concept CGI-enhanced play later in the film, while poor Scarlett runs around looking every inch the generic blonde action damsel, right down to her stiletto black leather boots.

Also disturbingly distracting is what appears to be a growing trend in big-budget movies: relentless product placement. As in life, Microsoft is inescapably everywhere (oh, look, the white pages in the future are - MSNsearch!), along with Nokia, Diet Coke, Xbox, Puma, Aquafina (plugged EVERYWHERE), Budweiser, Reebok, Cadillac, and innumerable others, including a very, very familiar ad campaign for Calvin Klein featuring - who else? - Scarlett Johansson. Bay actually plays the whole TV spot for us, via a little screen in a shop window, and has Johansson reacting to it in a scene that would be ironically funny if it weren't so clearly oblivious to its own commercialness. I don't object to having real-world products in films; it can add a useful air of verisimilitude when it's not pummeling you over the head with its presence, and when it makes sense to be there. In 2019, it...doesn't. It makes one ask ""why"" questions of one's own, like: Why is absolutely everyone 14 years in the future still driving 2005 Caddys that amazingly look brand-new? Why do they have hovercraft and high-tech floating trains, yet still drive cars with *tires*? Why have brand labels remained unchanged for over a decade? And why if they can clone Ewan McGregor can they not develop a better game console than Xbox?

Ultimately Bay comes off looking like he wanted to make a thoughtful sci-fi thriller along the lines of ""A.I."" or ""Minority Report"" or even the first ""Matrix,"" films that consider, however cursorily, the implications of what it means to be human (or not) and struggling for survival. Unfortunately Bay hasn't got the style or artistic chutzpah of Spielberg or the Wachowskis; his filming sensibilities are more in keeping with those of a pretentious but attention-deficit fifteen-year-old. He loses patience with his restrained sci-filosophy flick before it has a chance to really get going, instead deciding on his usual method of blowing stuff up, letting the debris settle, and then smashing that too.",1122422400,3,7998,5.058377558756634
850819,4,6304328583,"When you go see a film that has the name Michael Bay attached to it in some way, you can expect a few things:

1) A ton of explosions
2) At LEAST one car chase, but better make it two just in case
3) Impractical feats of survival
4) Gun fights
5) Steve Buscemi

So, number 5 is a joke because he hasn't been in many of Michael Bay's films but when he is he definitely adds a plus in my book.  What you don't necessarily expect from a Michael Bay film is a superb story.  Which is why The Island is his best work.

That said, there are some things that were pretty stupid and make you think.  Here were some questions/comments I had while watching:

1) Boy there's a lot of product placement (Microsoft's Xbox and MSN)
2) In 2090 they have trains that move on hovering pods, trolly type vehicles that move between sky scrapers, and flying ""wasp"" bikes that are super cool.  So why are we still driving cars with tires?
3) Cars tend to flip really easily.
4) Boy there's a lot of product placement (Aquafina)
5) Large metal rods don't just smash into cars, they cause them to flip up in the sky and explode
6) Boy there's a lot of product placement (NBC)
7) Mack trucks stop on a dime in 2090
8) Boy there's a lot of product placement (Miller beer)
9) Boy there's a lot of product placement (Chevy)
10) Did I mention the product placement?

Seriously, there were a ton of product placements that were so intrusive you just laugh after seeing the fifth one.  I'm not talking about billboards in the background or someone sipping on a Coke or something.  I mean, the product placement has become IMPORTANT to the story.  Much like Taco Bell in Demolition Man but less funny and more intrusive.  Between Ewan and Scarlett using a MSN search engine kiosk in order to find someone, to the Xbox being used to dispel the aggression in the clones, to drinking Miller beer (the Miller being displayed in the fore front and the camera pausing on it just so we know that yes, cool clones drink Miller!) to Aquafina that was not only served but was ON TAP like in a bar, we just had to laugh at every new product placement that, for some, became instrumental for the plot.

And honestly, don't you think if we have mastered the art of the levitating train and trollys between buildings (at like the 70th floor) that we wouldn't have rubber tires?  And that our cars wouldn't run on explosive substances?  Why do the cars mostly look like cars of today? oh wait, product placement.

But I digress.

Professional reviewers have mentioned that the Island is like a double feature.  The first movie is a brooding, futuristic society that appears to be utopian but has a seedy underside.  The second is a summer blockbuster with more bullets, explosions and car chases than you can shake a stick at.  While this is true in a way, I found that the beginning 45 minutes really lead into the rest of the movie and, to me, felt connected.  I never once felt like I was watching two different movies; the tension and lead up of the first act exploded both metaphorically and literally into the running, driving and exploding.

Michael Clarke Duncan (Green Mile) provides the movie's most memorable and haunting scene.  He isn't in the movie very much; in fact he only has one true scene.  But that scene was very harsh and eye-opening both for the viewers and for Ewan McGregor's Lincoln Six Echo.  Kudos to him for, in one scene, stealing the movie.

Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johansson do a great job in their roles as clones who don't know what it means to be human.  Ewan McGregor, specifically, does an excellent job; especially when he meets himself.  You can tell he had a great time playing two polar opposites.

Honestly, this isn't the ""best movie of the summer"" or anything (for me, that distinction goes to Batman Begins).  But, what it does is gives us the thing that Michael Bay does so well (blowing stuff up) and gives it a very good, interesting story.  I do think its sad that of all of Michael Bay's movies, this one isn't selling as well.  When you have movies like Pearl Harbor, Armageddon and the Rock making a ton of money, it's pretty sad that a Michael Bay movie that has an excellent story doesn't do too well.  Hopefully word of mouth will carry this film forward.  It's still a summer blockbuster and in the end it's not as interested in discussing the sociological and ethical concerns of cloning as much as its interested in entertaining.  But is that a bad thing?  That's what summer movies are for and if you can be entertained by the visual cacophony of destruction while at the same time being mentally entertained with a tightly written and good sci-fi story, then what more could you want?  I would write more, but I'm suddenly feeling thirsty...bring on the Aquafina!",1122422400,2,4780,4.495944380069525
850820,4,6304328583,"Yep.  You read it right.  I just used Michael Bay's name and the phrase 'good movie' in the same sentance.  Until now, it had never crossed my mind to do so.  His best film previous to this was ""The Rock"" which was bearable because of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage, not Bay's directing.  As much fun as it is to bash on Bay's past shortcomings, this is a review for ""The Island"", not his nine other crappy movies (although I plan to bash on them all on this site as much as I possibly can in the future)

That being said, lets move on.  ""The Island"" opens and immediately lays down a premise for the society that is inhabited so many people.  The control mechanisms are established and the motivators for the people put into place.  They all believe that they are a part of the last surviving community of humans on the planet, after everyone else died tragically in a plague known as the Global Contamination.  The only way out of the facility is through what appears to be a lottery system, choosing people to repopulate the last known natural pathogen free zone on the planet... The Island.  Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is the first to really question his surroundings.  He goes on a routine errand for a supervisor and discovers a moth, which he believed to be extinct due to the Contamination.  This sets the wheels turning for the rest of the story, which centers around Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) and Lincoln progressing toward the ugly truth of the matter.  What ensues is not just a good movie, but an outstanding one that comments strongly on society as a whole, mainly how people will do anything to live, and ignore the consequences.  It illustrates human greed and lack of respect for life well, and it portrays society as a whole in a very negative and egotistical light.

Certain parts are very reminiscent of parts of Gattaca, The Matrix and especially Minority Report.  Other parts remind me of The Giver, a novel I read freshman year of High School.  Overall, the movie is quite original, though.  It doesn't borrow too heavily from its possible influences.

Another thing I applaud Michael Bay for is not getting too caught up in the whole love story element of the movie.  He tends to do that sometimes. (*Cough...Pearl Harbor...Cough*)  This time, the romantic elements acutally convey meaning and a point instead of just serving as mindless drivel like it did in, say, Pearl Harbor or Armageddon.  This time around it is as much about self discovory and learning as it is about anything else.

You know that since this is a big budget, Michael Bay film, there are going to be a lot of things that look cool, go fast and blow the hell up.  Action is superb and special effects are cool.  You notice quickly that everyone drives cars made under the Chrysler umbrella (Chrysler, Dodge, Chevy, Cadillac, GMC)  and even the cops are putting rims and custom hoods on thier cruisers in the future.  I can forgive them for the cheese factor though, because the action is that good.  The acting is also very strong on all fronts.  Ewan McGregor stands out, especially in a few scenes where he acts opposite himself.  Bay doesn't get absorbed in the kind of mindless crap that he usually gets caught up in, and the result is a fast paced movie that is also intelligent.  He does the unthinkable, combining all the good parts of a summer blockbuster with all the good parts of the material he had to work with.  He really does score here with The Island.  I don't really have any major beefs with it.  Cherish the moment, because you really don't know when he'll make another good movie.

The Final Word:  The best movie of its kind since Minority Report.  Highly recommended.  I still can't get over the fact that I'm recommending a Michael Bay movie, but it's awesome...seriously.",1122336000,2,3810,4.629850746268657
850821,4,6304328583,"This movie starts off a little slow as it establishes the premise. But later it has lots of action with excellent CGI effects which complement the futuristic environment. From the concept the film has a touch of ""Coma"" and ""Blade Runner"" with a superb execution making it its own. The acting is okay, and the movie is mostly carried by the concept, premise and execution of great photography and direction. It's also a smart motion picture with an actual storyline, etc. Also, many new vehicles in modified form like the Dodge Magnum and Chrysler 300 C, the Cadillac SRX, the Honda Element, etc. including some concept cars can be found in this flick. After the film ended, most of the movie goers I observed and met seemed to like this movie a lot and felt that they got an incredible entertainment experience which was well worth their money. The bottom line is that it is well worth watching this film because of the excellent concept, vision and execution, and most likely it will make it into my DVD collection.",1122336000,3,1016,4.681564245810056
850822,4,6304328583,"First, I will say that I am one of those people who like Micheal Bay's movies. They are mostly action-packed and entertaining. This movie is no different. The best way to seeing this movie is not knowing the plot. So I will not give it here. I will say that this is a mix of Minority Report and Logan's Run. The beginning does have a Spielberg feel to it, (the script was giving to Micheal Bay from Steven Spielberg.) The middle part becomes pure Micheal Bay trademark. He has the chases on the ground, the chase on the highway, and the chase on a building. The plot is very involving, but that's what made it a thought-provoking action sci-fi movie.

I really enjoyed this movie with great performances from Scarlett Johannson, Ewan McGregor, Sean Bean, and Steve Buchemi. The action is top-notch and the effects are incredible. This is Micheal Bay's first movie without Jerry Bruckheimer, but that doesn't mean anything since his trademark is through the film with Spielberg in it.",1122249600,,983,4.715116279069767

You get the thinking man's summer blockbuster- The Island. Other than Batman Begins, this is by far the best action movie I've seen in awhile. I have a feeling its not going to get the recognition it deserves- much like Scarlett Johansson actually, although this isn't her most difficult role, she still pulls it off. Steve Buscemi is fascinating as always, one of my favorite actors. And Ewan McGregor is delicious to watch- he has this tough innocent quality to him that makes him so watchable as an actor.

I don't know if I've ever experienced the dead silence after a movie that I did in the theatre after viewing The Island. Everyone just sat there for a moment... and then quietly got up, and filed out. And it wasn't disgust, or dislike, it was the quiet of thought. Of people mulling over what they just saw- thinking about issues such as the value of life, the pros and cons of cloning, and both the cruelty and strength of human beings. There are major questions posed under the surface of The Island that you may either ignore and enjoy an action movie, or ponder and digest long after the flickering of the projector has faded.",1122249600,3,1249,4.647058823529412

The movie The Island proves to be a pretty decent popcorn movie. There is nothing here that any movie fan haven't seen before. The cast were great and they were the reason why I enjoyed the movie to a certain level. Sean Bean, Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson and rest were quite good and they made the movie worthwhile. However, the script and the story proves to be quite a letdown. I don't think Michael Bay did a good job directing here and the action sequences seem to be bit too predictable and some what boring.

This movie proves to be a direct take-off from the 1979 movie called the ""Parts: Clonus Horror"", an awful B level film that few ever saw. The story of that movie have people cloning themselves for spare parts. Gee, that sound just like The Island!

This movie should provides some entertainment for the undemanding audience out there. The first part of the movie was actually quite good, reminded me of the Brave New World type of concept. But once the chase sequences began, its all alot of bullets flying around, hitting everyone but the two stars. It turned into a your typical shoot'em up type of film, losing it all for just cheap thrills. Personally speaking, I think this would make a decent DVD rental but its not worth real money to see.",1122249600,5,1383,4.528
850825,3,6304328583,"One of the best things about watching a good science fiction film is the opportunity to see interesting interpretations of what the future might look like. If ""The Island"", the new film by Michael Bay, is to be believed, the year 2019 is dominated by Aquafina Water, Michelob Light, Cadillac, Adidas and Microsoft. Everyone uses these brands, and only these brands. And when they use them, we get a long, loving look at the logos. When exactly did the extent of creating a futuristic universe become product placement? ""I, Robot"" also fell victim to this (over)using Audi and Adidas. In one scene, Will Smith's character gushes over his new Adidas. Filmmakers! Use your imagination. The future is more than product placement lines.

Michael Bay's ""The Island"", starring Ewan McGregor (""Star Wars: Episode III"") as Lincoln Six Echo and Scarlett Johansson (""Lost In Translation"") as Jordan Two Delta, is about a select group of people who have escaped the widespread contamination of the planet. They currently live in a safe holding facility, segregated by sex, working, exercising, waiting for their chance to win a trip to live on the Island, the last uncontaminated bit of land on the planet. But Lincoln Six Echo begins to ask questions of Merrick (Sean Bean), the leader of the facility. And he finds some answers, alarming answers.

""The Island"" is all `too'; too long, two separate films, and filled with too many product placements.

The first part of the film tells the story of Lincoln and Jordan, establishing their life in the facility, after the widespread contamination, giving us an alarming look at the future. Surprisingly, a fair bit of humor is interspersed, enlivening the story. All of the inhabitants have their every step monitored and if something is noticed, everything is changed accordingly. One morning, after Lincoln awakens, he has a pee and his urine is instantly monitored and an abnormal sodium level is detected. At breakfast, the server knows this and refuses him his customary bacon. Just as Jordan is called to leave for the Island, Lincoln learns some secrets and tries to convince her not to leave.

This part of the film works fairly well. Bay has abandoned the frenzied editing style he used to excess in films like ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" in favor of actually telling a story, developing characters, building a time and place. From the moment we are introduced to Lincoln and Jordan, we get a sense that something is wrong with them, with their society. Everyone rescued from the contaminated areas is very nave and childlike. What happened to them before they were rescued? Bay handles this well and uses his budget to create glossy, well-rendered settings which are, unfortunately, marred by excessive product placements.

At one point, Lincoln complains that all they have to wear is white. ""It's impossible to keep clean."" I almost expected a hand to reach in from off screen and hand him some Tide or All. Because Product Placements have become so standard in film and television, the next step is to make them prominent. We are so used to seeing a Coke can pop up in a film, we might overlook it. Filmmakers now have to make sure the product gets noticed. Science Fiction seems to be the vehicle of choice for this type of advertising. In films like ""I, Robot"" and ""The Island"", the filmmakers have taken already recognizable brands or concepts for future products and use them as ""The Future"" in their films. Because Cadillac allowed the use of their concept cars, the camera seems obligated to linger on the logo on each cars grill, lovingly, for long periods of time. A `futuristic' bottle of Michelob Light sits in front of Steve Buscemi's character. They need to leave the bar immediately, but he still has time to pick up the bottle, logo front and center, take a drink, and put the bottle back on the bar, the camera holding on the bottle after Buscemi has left. Enough with the product placements already.

This bit of the story fills the first 45 minutes or so. Then Bay seems to get bored. The second part of the film becomes a more traditional action film. Lincoln and Jordan are chased through one situation after another. As this is a Michael Bay film, the chase scenes are big, loud and impressive, but they just don't fit with the first half of the film. First of all, the two characters are so nave and childlike, how are they able to escape a band of hired mercenaries lead by Djimon Hounsou for so long? Lincoln and Jordan know nothing beyond the containment facility, yet they are able to allude this team of men in helicopters, motorcycles and souped up Cadillacs for almost an hour of screen time. How exactly do they know that the information booths emblazoned with the MSN logos will be able to help them? Or that they should avoid the many MTA trains gliding through the sky? How much did the MTA pay for that piece of fiction? As impressive as the action scenes are, they just don't work with the rest of the film.

At about two hours and fifteen minutes, the film is way too long. The first part is good, but at 45 minutes, it seems like a major portion of the film. When the chase begins and it then lasts for over an hour, you start squirming in your seats. Alarmingly, Bay even stops the chase at one point for Johansson to watch her own Calvin Klein Perfume commercial in a shop window. Huh?

Both of the lead actors are acceptable, but I expect so much more from both. McGregor has been in a series of very good independent and foreign films. He is a very good actor and in ""The Island"", he manages to convey Lincoln's naivet and curiosity well. What he doesn't manage to do is convince us that he can suddenly outwit a band of mercenaries chasing him. As Jordan, Scarlett Johansson takes a real step back. This is the type of role Jessica Biel would be good at. Standing around, looking good, like eye candy. In the film, someone exposes the two to Maxim magazine. Didn't Johansson do a spread for Maxim at one point? Basically, she acts like a living spread for Maxim throughout the entire film. She looks good standing next to McGregor's character and acts dumb throughout.

The first part of the film shows that Bay can make a film about characters, with a story, and create a definite sense of time and place. Now, he simply has to stop second-guessing himself and allow this creative side to take over. Mr. Bay, you don't need to resort to elaborate freeway chases to tell a story. Throwing large wheels off the back of a truck at pursuing Cadillacs might make for a fun chase, but they aren't necessary in every film. You can do better, Mr. Bay. Remember ""The Rock""? Excessive yes, but in a fun way.",1122249600,2,6692,4.688510638297872

The clones have no idea they are clones.  They consider themselves ordinary human beings...which, in many respects they are.  They are held in a compound under the pretext that the outside world is contaminated to the point of being deadly.  Now and then a lottery is held for the inhabitants and the winner is allowed passage to the ""Island"" which is the lone uncontaminated natural place on the planet.  One of the clones, Lincoln, discovers that winners are not being sent to the island but are being killed (to provide body parts, organs for the rich individuals who can afford this service).  His lady friend Jordan has just won the lottery and so he decides to escape with her in order to save her life.

Despite the many wonders it can work, technology often tends to exacerbate already existing human problems.  Though it is only touched upon tangentially in this film, one of those problems is class stratification.  Only rich people can afford this cloning service: it costs around 5 million dollars. On the one hand we can make analogies with the current problem of health care in the US, where more and more the wealthy can afford quality health care, while many get poor service or none at all.  On top of this, there are many cognitive enhancers on the horizon.  Just as the rich can afford to send their children to Harvard and Stanford, one can imagine that technology might eventually allow the wealthy access to drugs, methodologies to improve memory, thinking etc and have an undue advantage over others.

Of course the above is not the main ethical problem dealt with in the movie.  The real problem is that actual humans, though they be clones, are being murdered.  The director of the corporation is unable or unwilling, perhaps due to greed and power-hunger, to see this fact.  He can only see that he is helping his clients.

The primaries are unaware that the above murders are taking place.  They only know about the organs, etc, they recieve.  When Lincoln finds his primary and confronts him with the facts, he hopes the primary will be sympathetic and denounce the act publicly.  But the primary, who is suffering from hepatitis, realizes that to do so would mean that the transplant he needs to survive would not take place.  He attempts to return the clone to the corporation.

Is this so far removed from our current situation?  Most of us, due to greed or self-interest, would prefer to keep our heads buried in the sand about certain world events. We don't see the Amazon forest being decimated and news of this registers but does not move us to action.  Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, we are told by our President (and others who have an interest) that global warming is a liberal conspiracy.  We either pay no attention, prefer to believe the Rush Limbaughs of the world, or, perhaps worse, don't care.

This film is set in 2015 but the ethical concerns are already with us.  Technology, per se, is not to blame, but as evidenced in this film, the confluence of greed, self-delusion and overwhelming technology makes a pernicious cocktail",1122249600,3,3686,4.7788309636650865
850827,5,6304328583,"I have seen Star Wars III, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds, and The Fantastic Four.  While all those movies were excellent, The Island outshines them all.  Scarlett Johansen and Euwene MacGregor are excellent as clones who have lived in an enclosed city with the promise of an ultimate trip to ""The Island.""  This is supposed to be the ultimate reward for their service and those that get chosen to go, do so via a lottery.

MacGregor starts to get haunted by a dream where he is on a boat and being drowned.  He tells this dream to the city doctor who appears to be more than intrigued by it, in fact he has a mechanical table violently take hold of MacGregor and inject robot mini probes into the sides of his eyes.

MacGregor's curiousity makes him start to question everything and it is sparked more by a maintenance man (Steve Busemi) who lives outside the enclosed city.  (The people are told that the outside was contaminated from a great castrophe).  This curiousity continues to increase when he finds a rather large insect.  MacGregor starts to learn the real truth behind the ""lottery"" and save his lady friend (Johansen) who has won the lottery and is scheduled to go to the supposed island.

The rest of the movie plays out like a super high tech version of Logan's Run.  The special effects are amazing especially the futurastic Los Angeles.  Even though you can kind of figure what will happen, the movie is compelling mostly due to the excellent acting of the two stars.",1122249600,2,1487,4.612167300380228
850828,2,6304328583,"There's a bunch of clones that are closed off from the real world in a tightly secured building. The clones think that they're real people, and have memory imprints built into them, and they think that the reason that they were sent to this mysterious building was because they were contaminated with something harmful. So, there is a lottery, and whenever an inmate wins the lottery, they get sent to the island, which is just a hologram. They're made to believe that the island is the ideal, peaceful place to be, when they're actually being sent to a much more unpleasant place, where parts of their body are harvested. Whenever the clones are created, their minds are made to be accepting of where they are, without questioning why they are where they are.

So, along comes a guy named Lincoln who questions everything, despite being a clone, and he collaborates with a girl named Jordan and meet up with Steve Buscemi's character, and he reveals to them that they are just clones that were made just to be used for specific parts and organs. Whenever the girl tries to disprove that theory, Steve Buscemi repeats to her the childhood memory that the girl claimed to have, reassuring her that it's just one of about 10 different fake memories that the clones have. So, the cover is blown for the people that are exploiting the clones for their parts, and Lincoln and Jordan are in trouble because the people know that they found out what they have been doing, so Lincoln and Jordan are on the run, and they eventually get them and tell the other clones what has been going on.

It's easily the most complicated movie that I ever saw. Before I saw it, I read a synopsis of it and had a vague understanding of it, and the scene where Steve Buscemi explains everything out in simple terms helped the movie because I would suspect that I wasn't the only person that was pretty much lost with what was going on up until then. It was a really good premise for a movie, but I didn't like the movie at all. It seemed to jump around a lot, and too many things were implied. The movie was set in 2019, and at one point, they referred to a law of 2050. And, I don't get why Lincoln's clone had the ability to question everything and none of the others could. The organs of the clones had to be kept active for them to be later harvested, and that's why the people worked and lived normal lives. My friend thought it was bogus that the organs of the clones had to be kept active, and told me that the organs of the clones should have been just as useful regardless of whether they were being used or stored in a meat locker. That was his only problem with it. The first half of the movie seemed like reality TV to me, and the second half was just a whole bunch of stunts and action and stuff blowing up and chases. Michael Bay has taken heat for making movies with too much action and not enough plot, like Armageddon and Bad Boys, and with this movie I think he might have made too much of a plot. It confused me a lot, and I'm a college graduate.",1122163200,,3040,4.35978835978836
850908,5,6304328583,"This is the biggest action-packed movie of the year so far! Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are likeable in their roles, and Scarlett Johansson looks totally hot! It starts out as a sci-fi movie.  As McGregor and Johansson's characters discover that they are clones whose purpose is to supply their hosts with body parts, the movie turns into an action-packed chase thriller as they try to escape from being harvested!",1122076800,4,423,5.042857142857143
850909,5,6304328583,"This movie, because it's a ""Summer, Sci-Fi/Action"" flick, will probably do extremely well at the box office, if for no other reason than the fact that Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are in the cast.  Regrettably, however, even after it's been out for awhile it will probably never reach as wide and diverse an audience as it deserves until it's release on DVD, when-- hopefully-- positive word of mouth recommendations will lead those who usually avoid this particular genre to it.  Because ""The Island,"" directed by Michael Bay, is a cautionary, thought-provoking tale set in the not-so-distant future that holds a mirror up to our current society and poses some serious questions about moral judgement and how unmitigated secrecy on the part of institutions and those we ""should"" be able to trust affects us all on a daily basis that is especially relevant in today's world.

The story concerns the survivors of a ""contamination"" who must dwell within a seemingly sterile, self-contained city where their happiness is paramount to those in charge, while at the same time their only hope for the future is to be the next lottery winner, which would afford them a one-way ticket to the last uncontaminated place on earth, The Island.  And to tell it, director Bay, no stranger to action films with such offerings as ""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon"" and ""Bad Boys I&II"" under his belt, has drawn upon myriad other classics of the genre and used the collective threads to successfully weave his own story and imprint it with the kind of metaphor that elevates it beyond the next action sequence or explosion.  A comparison to ""Logan's Run"" goes without question, along with an obvious nod to ""Blade Runner,"" a smattering of ""The Matrix"" and even a pinch of ""Star Wars.""  Which is not to say this is a ""copy"" of any of those; it definitely is not.  Bay has merely-- and wisely-- drawn upon some of the more successful elements of those films, and in most instances expanded upon them, to deliver a memorable film that far surpasses the genre's usual board of fare.

Arguably, this is Michael Bay's best overall film to date.  Though he has demonstrated in the past that he knows how to do action, he has outdone even himself with this one.  There is one heart-stopping scene, for example, involving a number of vehicles and helicopters that eclipses even the highly touted freeway sequence of the second ""Matrix"" film.  The F/X are top notch, and once the action begins in earnest, he sets a pace that builds the excitement without allowing it to lay or lapse even for a second, right up to the very end.  Add to that the fact that this film really has something to say, and it will make you appreciate what Bay and his company of actors and technicians have accomplished here even more.

Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as Lincoln Six Echo, using his boyish charm, good looks and manner to lend the necessary credibility of innocence to his character.  The charismatic Scarlett Johansson finds just the right note, as well, to bring her character, Jordan Two Delta, to life.  Bay gives each of his actors, in turn, a moment in which to define their respective characters and underscore the plausibility of the film, and when that time comes they each succeed in a way that sustains the interest in the story beyond the action and the F/X.  Excellent performances by both McGregor and Johansson.

In a supporting role, Steve Buscemi adds color to the proceedings as McCord, the man with the answers to a number of questions Lincoln Six has been asking about their environment and way of life; questions to which others in positions of authority respond with guarded circumspection, among them Merrick, one of the apparent caretakers of the city.  Played by Sean Bean, Merrick is one of the pivotal characters of the film, and while Bean's performance is decent, it lacks the nuance that could have taken it to a much higher level.  As it is, while effective to an extent, it is a fairly lackluster and generic portrayal.

The excellent supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Starkweather); Ethan Phillips (Jones Three Echo); Brian Stepanek (Gandu Three Echo); Noa Tishby (Community Announcer); and Siobhan Flynn (Lima One Alpha).  For most, ""The Island"" will be an exciting summertime diversion; but for those who pay attention to the underlying social and political significance of the story, the rewards will most likely exceed any and all expectations.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1122076800,187,4496,4.8727034120734904
850910,3,6304328583,"This movie is quite an entertaining, non-stop action ride for the summer. It has so much crazy, over the top action, to bring your summer action fun right in your face.

Nobody can direct an action movie like Michael Bay. With a track record like: The Rock, Armageddon, Bad Boys, and Pearl Harbor, you just know he can deliver the goods.

One thing that is quite unique that not all action movies have is a deep storyline. This futuristic/sci-fi thriller about clones and deception really is amusing to watch. As the story builds in the first 30 minutes, you reall as though you're not going on and you have to rely on Ewan McGregor's character to guide you in finding out how what happened in the world and why these people are sealed in this facility.

The story is quite intriguing and when the plot turns into a huge, action-packed, effects-filled thrill ride, you'll be smiling in your seat with total enjoyment.",1122076800,2,917,4.648148148148148
850911,4,6304328583,"Lots of good pieces come together, to make a movie that's a cut above the usual summer junk. I'd say that this is quite exceptional summer junk.

The premise is a bit far-fetched, but only a bit. There's a farm where the livestock have happy, contented lives, right up to the day they trot cheerily off to the slaughter. The consumers never get a look behind the closed doors, and never deal with the true cost of the 'product' they buy. The livestock are human, though. One wakes up to what's behind the life they lead, and escapes with another.

That plot covers about the first 20% and the last 10% of the movie. Everything in the middle is a wild chase, trying to recover (or at least cover up) the escape. That part is an effects-fest. It has great running around, lots of stuff blowing up, and helicopter gunships tearing around downtown LA. This was supposed to be a quiet operation, right? That's why the scriptwriters picked the one city where a shootup like a small war could be considered normal.

The running gunbattles are good: cars, trucks, helicopters, and something that looks like a jet-ski with extra jet and no ski. A few things arent' so good, though. At one point, the evil board of directors decides to cull the herd, sending four generations (i.e. four year's worth of human clones) to the abbatoir, a $200M writeoff. We learn, however, that each clone has a $5M retail price. Ignoring retail markup, that's a loss of 40 'products', which I take to mean ten per year. It looked like a whole lot more people than that down in the farm. But hey, they're scriptwriters, not accountants.

If you ignore all the implausible stuff and the adrenaline-rich chase scenes, there is a real point here. No sane human cloning proponent intends for thinking, feeling people to be slaughtered. No rational cloning opponent would object to discarding a smear of skin cells in a petri dish. Society as a whole has to work this one out, to draw lines between what's ethical and what's not, and to make room for different people to draw different lines. One purpose of art is to interpret science, and exaggeration is a valid tool for achieving that purpose.

Mostly, though, it's summer SF adventure flick. Enjoy.

850912,3,6304328583,"This movie fits into the ""genetic manipulation"" subgenre of sci-fi, in the tradition of films like Gattaca, Equilibrium, and Code 46, although with more of an action-flick slant, like one of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi pics.  It does have its moments - a few interesting scenes and ideas.  Overall, though, it was too long, with a storyline that doesn't always make sense.  I actually found it fairly boring at times.

850913,2,6304328583,"Lincoln Six Echo has never seen the outside world.  He lives a peaceful if restricted life in a tightly closed underground system, performing menial tasks the purpose of which is unknown to him.  Periodically a citizen is selected via a lottery to be transferred to ""The Island,"" the last refuge on Earth free of contamination.  But Lincoln is smarter than the average worker.  He possesses an imagination, and he wonders about things.  One day his curiosity leads him out of his prescribed zone and he learns the horrific truth about the island and his reason for existence.

THE ISLAND could have been a thought-provoking, disturbing exploration of an all-too-plausible future, but this being a Michael Bay film, it turns into a big, dumb action movie halfway through.  Padded out with car chases and random carnage, it runs far too long and wastes the considerable talents of its lead actors with a minimal, uninspired script.

The film stars Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, Sean Bean (THE LORD OF THE RINGS), Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan (DAREDEVIL), Ethan Phillips (STAR TREK: VOYAGER), and Djimon Hounsou (CONSTANTINE).  It's a fair but uneven film that could have been much better had it been helmed by someone more insightful.",1122076800,3,1245,5.093596059113301
850914,4,6304328583,"Originality is not Michael Bay's strength, but having said that, I find his latest film 'The Island' fairly entertaining Sci-fi action.  You can call it a copycat of another films in the past -- 'Logan's Run''Blade Runner''The Sixth Day' etc. -- the list would be a very long one, but that doesn't mean that this film is not worth watching.  And surely Michale Bay knows how to make good actions.

The film can be divided into two parts.  In the first, you see Ewan McGregor as ""Lincoln Six-Echo"" in tight white costume wake up from a bad dream.  Living in some big institute managed by wards in uniform, everyday Lincoln is medically checked, is told to do certain things like putting colored substances into tubes, and is curiously attracted to ""Jordan Two-Delta,"" a beautiful blonde female played by Scarlett Johansson though it is strictly prohibited by the authority to touch each other.  But why these rules?

The secrets are not really secrets to many of you, and you may find the first 30 minutes pretty dull -- I did -- but anyway, the inmates in this building believe that the world outside is 'contaminated,' and only a few selected ones can go to 'The Island' the ultimate paradise left on the earth.

Of course, we know better, and Jordan and Lincoln, once outside the sanctuary after seeing the truths behind the place, have to survive the fight against the bounty hunters.  And in Bay's film, the survival means lots of actions -- chases involving cars, bikes, and choppers; shoot-outs, and hanging from the high building.

The actors are all good, though typecast.  They include Michael Clarke Duncan (only in a few scenes), Sean Bean (in his typical villain mode), Djimon Hounsou, and Steve Buscemi who gives some good laughs when opening his closet in his home.

The film's time is set in near future, about 15 years from now, but the production designs, collecton of pieces from another sfi-fi films, are not convincing enough to convey the touch of the futuristic world.  But you should know that it's a Michael Bay film, and in his films, like in 'Pearl Harbor,' accuracy means nothing.  It's actions that really count, and they are reasonably done.

So is it good?  It depends.  'The Island' has good actions, thrills, and a few disturbing moments (thanks to the role of Michael Clarke Duncan), but it does not mean Michael Bay did something new.  But he knows what he is doing, and he did it better than before.",1122076800,3,2434,4.7274881516587675
850915,5,6304328583,"The Island is a real science fiction movie of the ""Logan's Run"" variety, and outside of Star Wars III the best hard sf movie at least since Minority Report.  The first half of the movie takes place in a futuristic city, sort of an anti-utopia where every choice is made for  you, every aspect of your life is planned to optimize your health, because, we are lead to believe, a global contamination, or epidemic, has left few survivors, which are all brought to the city when found.  Life is pretty mundane, though healthy and stable.  Citizens have little to look forward to except a slim chance of winning a trip to the one remaining uncontaminated spot on Earth:  The Island.

Lincoln (Ewan McGregor) is one of these survivors who learns the real purpose of the city, it's occupants, and most ominously and secretly, trips to the Island.  Lincoln and  his girlfriend Jordan (Scarlett Johansson) embark on their own ""Logan's Run"" to escape the city and reveal the deadly secret.  The rest of the film is an action-packed chase involving explosions and crashes of just about every type of vehicle, with more effective special effects than most action movies -  in broad daylight in realistic settings.

Sean Bean is good as the bad guy, Steve Buscemi better as one of his employees, Ethan Philips best as one of their typical victims.

Personally I'd rather see a better script, some relationships I care about, and a plot that makes just a little sense.
