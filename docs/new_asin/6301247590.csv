Recently I found it here on Amazon, and couldn't click to buy it fast enough.  While being slightly different than what I remembered it when I saw it before, it is still a very good movie.",1031270400,,334,4.107692307692307

I grew up in the USA, and I am 19 now and living in Germany, and was so extactic to find that long lost part of my childhood again here in Amazon.  I was looking for this movie for a long time.

323938,4,6301247590,"I loved watching this as a kid. My mom bought the vhs for my sister and I and we would watch it over and over again. Unfortunately, we moved and somehow the movie was lost but after searching and searching I finally found it here for a reasonable price.
The disc arrived in an accurate time frame and the picture is very clear. However, the volume is not at all what I expected as throughout the entire film the volume goes up & down on its own and in certain scenes the characters have echos when speaking. Im not sure if the seller was unaware or simply didn't mention it out of fear it wouldnt get purchased if buyers were aware. I have to use my tv remote to change the volume up & down trying to hear it instead of enjoying the movie with my baby. Because of this I rate 4 stars.",1457913600,,784,4.097402597402597

323971,5,6301247590,"I recently found a copy of this and watched with my daughters, who are twelve and fourteen years old, and they both loved it just as much as I did when I was their age.

This work comes from the Golden Age of children's animation, and may actually mark the end of that period.  The artwork is distinctly non-Disney, the storylines and themes are relevant even today, and the main character, Heidi, is irrepressible in a way we can all relate to - at least in some fashion.

The music is pervasive - more so than even in Disney films - but oddly it never seems to interrupt the movie's flow.  The Governess in the last act is suitably villainous, and the writers don't attempt to bludgeon viewers over the head with an agenda.  The themes and issues explored are, appropriately, backseat to the little girl's surprisingly sad story that never does seem to get the better of her.

They don't make them like this any more.  If you haven't watched it and have young children, give it a look.  You won't be disappointed!",1402099200,,1015,4.478260869565218

323977,5,6301247590,"I saw on this on VHS and now this is on DVD it is still one of my favorites to this day. It's very colorful and kids will like the characters and colorful creatures found throughout the film. Adult/parents will like the story and the conflicts that both Heidi and her grandfather have to deal together and apart. It's a very touching film especially towards the end, but I won't reveal what happens...you've got to see the movie to find out!",1362182400,,441,4.45679012345679
323998,5,6301247590,"Took the studio long enough, but here it is. An underrated classic. The best part?

This DVD has been digitally remastered. Yes, retuned and cleaned up.. Except for some minor tracking lines during the instrumental intro, the rest of the film is flawless. It feels like I have watched it for he first time, even though I was too young to remember my first viewing nearly 2 decades ago. Nobody makes animated features like one anymore. Heidi's Song has a special place in my heart.

Also: yes, my copy plays on my Toshiba laptop. No problems here.",1355356800,,546,4.618556701030927
323999,5,6301247590,"I must've watched it more than a 100 times when I was a little girl! The music is wonderful, the animation smooth for its day, the voice acting is great! Heidi's great determination to be cheerful and always make the best of her situation is what makes her character admirable! When I was little, I'd always enjoyed the dream sequence because of all the imaginative creatures and bright colors. I still found myself laughing at the ballroom ghost sequence and I was still smiling by the end of this rich cartoon.

This last year I began searching for it and found the VHS offered on Amazon. But I wanted the DVD. My waiting was rewarded. :) And it was at a lower price! Made it even better.

There is a lot of singing in it (8 songs or so).  But the story of how one little girl changes several lives by her positive outlook and kind nature is more than worth it!

Family appropriate. :)",1355270400,,887,4.357575757575757

I have waited for almost 24 years for it to be released again. I now have two little girls of my own who really love this movie as much as I did. The picture is fantastic just as I remember it being. Best movie of its time. Its truly a heart warming story and perfect for all ages!!!,1352419200,,440,3.8461538461538463
324001,5,6301247590,I enjoyed watching this movie many times as a child and was very excited to find it on DVD.

324002,5,6301247590,"Timing is everything, especially when a feature film is released. When Hanna-Barbera released ""Heidi's Song"" in 1982 through Paramount, family films had become more edgy and sophisticated, while this warmhearted musical was something that might have been more widely embraced in the mid-60s, when ""The Sound of Music"" was a Hollywood smash.

It's very possible that Hanna-Barbera had ""Heidi's Song"" in the production pipeline for many years, assigning artists to it between TV series projects. Apparently it was a difficult film for Hanna-Barbera to complete. I recall a 1982 cover story in Millimeter Magazine in which director Robert Taylor (DuckTales, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, Men in Black: The Series) was attached to the film and some of it had to be redone.

Hanna and Barbera were clearly hoping for a Disney-type classic that would perhaps live on as an example of what they could do with the right amount of money and time. ""Heidi's Song"" really does show a lot more loving care -- and a much higher frame rate resulting in above-average animation fluidity by HB standards -- than most of their TV animation of the 70s and early 80s.

Story must have been a challenge, too, but William Hanna, Joseph Barbera, director Taylor and co-writer Jameson Brewer gave it their best shot. Like so many children's tales, Heidi may not have had enough plot to sustain an animated feature in the Disney tradition. So, like Disney, the filmmakers came up with many clever ways to keep things moving and add to the plot, including subplots with dogs and cats -- which are, of course, Hanna-Barbera specialties.

Among the film's biggest strengths is its score. Anyone who appreciates fine movie or show music will want to play this DVD on a stereo system to fully appreciate the scope of the music of Burton Lane (Finian's Rainbow) with lyrics by Sammy Cahn (Disney's Peter Pan, among many others). This is also the only major HB feature film arranged and conducted by house musical director Hoyt Curtin. It's a joy to hear what he could do with a gigantic orchestra and chorus (including Hollywood's best singers including Gene Merlino and BJ Baker).

There are so many songs, though, that some of them advance the plot (""A Christmas-sy Day,"" for example, covers the time in which Heidi adjusts to mountain life and bonds with her Grandfather), while others suspend the story. These are delightful, but not always crucial to the story. As Disneylike at ""Heidi's Song"" is, the film has roughly twice the amount of songs and musical set pieces than the average Disney fairy tale feature.

By the way, the box claims that there are 16 original songs and there are indeed 16 musical ""segments,"" but some are reprises and instrumentals, as I have noted here:

Overture (Orchestra & Chorus)
Good at Making Friends
Heidi's Nightmare (Orchestra)
A Christmas-sy Day
Heidi
An Armful of Sunshine
Heidi (reprise)
Frankfurt (Orchestra)
She's a Nothing
An Armful of Sunshine (reprise)
Monkey Theme (Orchestra)
Imagine
An Unkind Word
That's What Friends Are For
Ode to a Rat
End Title, including ""Wunderhorn"" (Orchestra & Chorus)

The voice cast is not star studded, but rather filled with the superstars of Hanna-Barbera and cartoons in general -- like Janet Waldo, Michael Bell, Joan Gerber, Pamelyn Ferdin, Fritz Feld, Frank Welker and others. Stage star Margery Gray (the wife of Fliddler on the Roof lyricist Sheldon Harnick) voices Heidi.

On the celebrity side, Lorne Greene bellows nicely as Grandfather and Sammy Davis Jr. brings the film to an even higher level with the excellent ""Ode to a Rat,"" a spectacular example of design, animation and especially the dazzling brass section so associated with Hanna-Barbera TV theme songs.

The rat sequence near the film's end, as well as the nightmare sequence near the beginning, could be scary for the very young children. Therein lies the dilemma with films like Heidi's Song, Annie and others with a primary appeal for girls but not for boys. Knowing this, HB's team added the darker moments as well as the dog, cat, and monkey mayhem. This only makes it harder to decide if Heidi's Song works for everyone.

It sure does for me, because I loved it when Hanna-Barbera reached higher than the usual level of TV animation. Personally, I think ""Charlotte's Web"" was their crowning achievement in theatrical films, but each one is a fascinating experience.

""Heidi's Song"" makes a particularly great listening experience. The 1982 K-Tel soundtrack album, released on vinyl, was a story record that emphasized dialogue and edited the music. A full-fledged musical soundtrack album was not released.

Now that this DVD is available, it's like having a soundtrack album. Okay, the movie can be as sticky as microwaved Jujubees, but c'mon now, that ""Wunderhorn"" tune is pretty magnificent in full stereo! Maybe if this DVD-R does well enough, the picture can be fully restored for Blu-ray.",1350345600,4,4926,5.0
324003,5,6301247590,I absolutely loved this film as a child and even had a cassette recording of the soundtrack. I would listen to the songs over and over and I really think this is a classic that should be preserved.  I hope it eventually gets re-released onto DVD for those of us who remember it! I would love to share this film with my own children someday.,1264723200,5,340,4.230769230769231

324005,5,6301247590,I watched this film as a young child and am still in love with it just as much after watching it 20 years later.  I purchased this film so that my 7-month old son may some day enjoy it as well.,1179705600,,193,3.707317073170732
324006,5,6301247590,"I saw Heidi's Song as a very small child, and it's had a place in my heart since then. First of all, Lorne Greene is the voice for Heidi's grandfather. His performance is beyond perfect. I absolutely love his singing voice, and I've always been touched by the emotion he puts out to bring grandfather to life.

All the music in this film is well crafted and fun to listen to, and the animation is gorgeous. You can't go wrong with this version of Heidi. It's an animated classic, and hopefully will be remembered for a long time.",1100476800,5,529,4.3979591836734695
324007,5,6301247590,"As with apparently every other reviewer here, this film made a huge impression on my childhood, and I lately found myself thinking about it and tracked it down.  After watching it again I was not disillusioned one bit--it is a masterpiece of a children's movie like Disney managed two or three times long ago and nobody bothers to make anymore.  When was the last time your daughter watched an animated tale with an actual overture?  In constrast to the wannabe-pop thing the big corporations have been dealing lately, with their frantically quipping heroes and slapstick animal sidekicks, this movie gives leash to the kind of magic usually left to the Grimms.  There is indeed an undiluted evil-stepmother type figure (who is laughed at in due time.)  There is also a dream sequence in which Heidi is abducted (to her soon delight) by mythical spirits of the wind.  The Swiss mountain ""Wonderhorn"" where Heidi lives with her Grandfather is carefully built up to an Eden-like magnificence that will heal everyone who crosses there.  Interspersed are many moments of humor and spunk, including a charmingly wicked song and dance by rats.  As a bottom line, it feels like a lovingly crafted production--even children know when they are watching fluff.  Show it to them, and they will notice the difference.",1044057600,13,1305,4.976958525345622
7810794,3,6301247590,"This movie has some nice animation, and songs. However, instead of the producers putting more of the Heidi story into the film, they seemed to eat up time with songs, or concepts that really don't add any great significants to the plot. The movie can drag at times, but is overall a fun watch. Nothing to scary for children. The only scenes that might scare younger viewers is the grandfather scene where he is talking/ singing about the monsters in the woods, and a much later scene where Heidi is stuck in a basement with rats who want to hurt her. However, nothing really scary. If you child can handle most Disney villain scenes, they probably can handle this film. I actually bought this film for myself, and not for children. For years I have been trying to find this film (I could not remember the full name of the film). During those years the one song that continued to haunt my mind was the ""that's what friends are for."" That was the only part of the film that I had remembered, so I was curious to remember what the movie was about. LOL
 Fun side note. Years ago I use to have a friend whose aunt worked on this same film as an animator/ cell painter. In my friends house, hung an animation painted cell of Heidi. I couldn't remember the name of the movie, but I remembered the ""that's what friends are for"" song when I saw it. LOL  Even my friend didn't know the name of the film. She only knew that her aunt worked on it....weird.",1522972800,,1444,4.344444444444444
