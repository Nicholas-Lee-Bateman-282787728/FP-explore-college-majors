2441250,5,B000BTITXK,"After the commercial and critical success of ""The Stud"" Joan Collins would star in its sequel titled ""The Bitch"" in 1979. The plot follows ""The Stud"" pretty much the same way in which Fontaine (the Collins character) is a rich socialte living in London who uses men the same way they use women. In this outing Fontaine becomes entangled with the mob who attempt to destroy her life and her business.

 Based on the best-selling novel of Jackie Collins, ""The Bitch"", along with ""The Stud"", would bring Joan to the attention of network executives and Aaron Spelling when they were casting Alexis in ""Dynasty"" in 1981. When asked if Joan ever had any regrets in life she is quick to respond that she wishes the producers had never used the title ""The Bitch"" as she found it offensive and expoitive. However, after much arguing with the film's producers about changing the title Joan realized it was a no win situation.

 ""The Bitch"" was a commercial success, but it was not without its problems during production. The script was barely finished, the wardrobe was incomplete, had a medicore director, and the leading man could hardly be heard when reading his lines so they had to be overdubbed.

 Still, I enjoyed ""The Bitch"" and Joan looks flawless. One also gets a great sense of the disco scene in Britain in the late seventies.

 ""The Bitch"", unfortunately, comes in full screen format and no bonuses are included. I am still waiting for a full-fledged release of this film in widescreen, along with extras, that I hope is not too long down the road. It would be wonderful to hear audio commentary by Joan on the making of this film.",1291766400,9,1634,4.688811188811189
2441251,4,B000BTITXK,"Who could possibly care if Fontaine's ""trendy disco"" goes in the toilet?  Or how she'll make ends meet until the next mark comes along?  Or why everyone seems to be having such a bad time making this movie?  Then there's the bizarre appearance of John Ratzenberger (Cliff from ""Cheers"") to contend with, also.  I've never seen anything that made being rich look so stupid and so silly.  Oh, and if you're wondering how to save an ailing discoteque, just hire some topless jive dancers in space make-up and project fake fire onto the wall--it'll do wonders for business.  I guess if you're a fan, Ms. Collins is doing what she does best here.  But the movie is just horrific, of course.  I stared in awe, alternately rolling my eyes, laughing at how unintentionally funny it is, and marvelling at the sheer camp.

And that's the reason to watch.

Before our eyes, we see the last days of disco and the failure of the sexual revolution.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is a document of a fascinating moment in social history.  The gloss and artificiality of 1979 are painstaking.  From the countless would-be pornographic sex scenes, scored to whacka-chicka music (and don't miss the dreadful group party scene toward the end), to the endlessly chromed and mirrored interiors, to the soft focus photography which connotes slick amorality--like a late-'70s Cadillac or Lincoln, it's an overwhelming clunker of glitz, glamour, and gratuity.

Soon enough, 1980 would come, bringing with it AIDS, Thatcher and Reagan, and smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.  It's a fitting end that Fontaine's cameo is engulfed in the flames of her own disco inferno at the closing credits--the party is over, the punchbowl's been taken away, and the hangover will be to hell to pay.",1191801600,9,1757,4.928571428571429

She discusses the mating rituals of rattlesnakes and the guy gets hot under the collar. The next morning she treats him like dirt and it's back to work for the poor slob.

Joan plays a European jetsetter out for sex and money. The orgy at the swimming spa is worth price of admission. I'm waiting for this to come out on DVD, but until then I have my VHS copy.",1106352000,2,531,4.257425742574258

8092486,2,B000BTITXK,"The Collins sisters, Jackie and Joan, teamed up again in 1979 to make The Bitch, trying to repeat what made its predecessor, The Stud, successful. That means lots of softcore sex and hardcore disco. Unfortunately, Jackie and Joan, aided and abetted by director Gerry OHara, who also adapted the book into a screenplay, appear to be faking it this time out. Its telling when the titular bitch Fontaine Khaled (Joan Collins) turns down an invitation to join a pool orgy, explaining shes now past that sort of thing. Had this moment come earlier in the movie, it would count as foreshadowing.

To its credit, The Bitch does have more of a story than The Stud. Fontaine becomes mixed up with Nico Cantafora (Michael Coby, a.k.a. Antonio Cantafora, the guy you cast when you cant afford Franco Nero), a gambler who uses her to smuggle a stolen diamond ring into London to offset a gambling debt owed to the mob, hiding the jewelry in the pocket of Fontaines fur coat while seated next to her on a plane. Nico and Fontaine are separated, so Nico enlists the help of his fence (a pre-Cheers John Ratzenberger) to track her down. Meanwhile, Fontaine has learned her nightclub, Hobo, is failing. Ever the shrewd businesswoman, she tries to save it by living it up at competing clubs, all of which look nearly identical. Its during Fontaines London club crawl that Nico catches up to her, seduces her and retrieves his stolen ringonly to lose Fontaine when she catches him riffling through her fur coats (What are you, a furrier?). When the plan to fence the ring goes south the mob, headed by a Thrush Feather (no, seriously), played by Ian Hendry with far more gravitas than the movie deserves, violently persuades Nico to fix a horse race. Nico seduces his way back into Fontaines good graces in order to execute his plan. However, when Fontaine learns of the race-fixing scheme she decides to make her own deal with the mob.

This all sounds a lot more hopping than it is. Though I haven't read either of the books on which The Stud and The Bitch are based, I am familiar enough with Jackie Collins other writings to know she was not one, in the words of drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs, to let the plot get in the way of the story. Criminal machinations and business schemes take a back seat to looking fabulous, going to parties and indiscriminate sex. But the parties here aren't as outrageous as they should be, and though Fontaine still has plenty of sex (its just orgies shes done with, or possibly just orgies in bodies of water), none of it is particularly heated or explicit, making one suspect it was the actress, not the character, who was past naked frolics in swimming pools. The movie does get one thing right, though: Joan does indeed look fabulous in her late-70s fashions.

And its Joan Collins who largely makes this movie compelling in spite of its tepid script, lukewarm sex scenes and bargain bin disco (the cheesy theme song and an early Blondie track are the only listenable songs on the soundtrack). Joan may show less skin this time out, but shes still in full vixen mode (How do you imagine me in the sack, Ricky? she teases her chauffeur). Though Dynasty was still a few years away when she made The Stud and The Bitch, one could see easily see the part of Fontaine Khaled as a dry run of Joans career-revitalizing role as Alexis Carrington.

In its Blu-ray incarnation The Bitch looks better than it likely ever has. Extras include trailers for this movie and its predecessor, but Kino Lorber neednt have bothered with the Gerry OHara interview or the commentary track from David Del Valle and Nick Redman, film historians with too much time on their hands. Fans are really only interested in hearing from two people involved with this movie, one of whom is no longer with us. The other one isn't talking.",1506211200,3,3832,4.647492625368732

8092492,5,B000BTITXK,"Joan Collins is Fontaine Khaled, a recently divorced London socialite.  This movie picks up from where ""The Stud"" ended.  This is a direct sequel to ""The Stud"".

The prequel ended with Fontaine Khaled getting caught on tape with a young man in an elevator.  An angry step-daughter finds the tape and leaves it where her father will find it.  The father, billionaire Benjamin Khaled (played by Walter Gotell), finds the tape and watches his wife make out with another man.  Fontaine arrives home to find a lawyer waiting in her living room.  The lawyer then proceeds to deliver the news that Mr. Khaled has filed for divorce.  The terms are that Fontaine keeps the house, the jewels, the car, and the nightclub.  Fontaine is devastated.  Her lover, who works at Hobo (the nightclub) loses his job.

Fast forward to ""The Bitch"" and we find Fontaine struggling to maintain her lavish lifestyle.  Her nightclub, Hobo, is not what it once was.  Revenues are down.  Her bankers and lawyers are understandably concerned.  On a flight from New York, Fontaine meets a charming Italian named Nico Cantafora.  They hit it off immediately.  Fontaine is attracted to Nico.  Unbeknownst to her, Nico is a professional gambler who owe a lot of money to a London crime boss named Feather.  Nico uses Fontaine to sneak a valuable ring past customs.  The two meet up later in London.  At first, Nico simply wanted to retrieve his ring.  Fontaine discovered the ring in her coat and replaced it with a fake.  Realizing that they are both hustlers, ""two of a kind"", kindred spirits, Fontaine falls in love with him.  Romance and sparks start to fly between the two.  Fontaine accepts Nico for what he is, a hustler and a con man.  Meanwhile, Nico receives pressure from his ""creditors"" to pay up.

Nico works out a deal with his creditors.  Feather wants him to work his way into Fontaine's social connections and get himself an invitation to a weekend getaway in the country.  His mission is to meet Vanessa Grant, a very wealthy friend of Fontaine's.  The mob wants him to run a scam on the Grants.  Meanwhile, Fontaine struggles to keep Hobo afloat.  Finally, Sammy, an old friend, comes to the rescue and offers to manage the nightclub.  Sammy turns the club around and it looks to be on its way to a comeback.

As the two main characters work out ways to extricate themselves out of their cash flow shortage, we are treated to some delightful performances from the supporting cast of Kenneth Haigh, John Ratzenberger, Carolyn Seymour, and Sue Lloyd.  This is a better movie than its predecessor.  The main dance song, performed by The Drifters, is called ""Pour Your Little Heart Out"" and it is very catchy.  I am very surprised that it did not make it big in the U.S.  It was a favorite with the dance crowd across the pond.  You won't find it on iTunes, but if you search around, you may be able to find it on an obscure beach music compilation CD here at Amazon.

This is a highly recommended movie.  I think you will enjoy it.",1395619200,3,3014,4.632575757575758
