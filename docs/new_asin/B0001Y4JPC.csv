8517446,5,B0001Y4JPC,"I bought this DVD for my brother for christmas by his request.  I am not a racing fan, but I watched some of it with him, and I must admit, it was pretty interesting and fun to watch.  There are in-car views, interviews with drivers, diagrams of the courses, and entertaining commentary.  A good purchase for racing fans and those who aren't so much.",1230508800,2,350,4.4375
