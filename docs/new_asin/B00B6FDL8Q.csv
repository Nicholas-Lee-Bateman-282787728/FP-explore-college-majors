5559806,5,B00B6FDL8Q,"I ordered both the DVD and book form of ""Psalm 83: The Missing Prophecy Revealed"", and I am very happy to report it is excellent in presentation and information for those wanting to learn about eschatology as it relates to current events!  It both DVD and book formats, Bill carefully walks the viewer/reader through the Psalms 83 and Ezekiel 38 prophecies and all other prophecies that appear to be related.  Very, very interesting and a must have for those interested in Eschatology (End Times Prophecies Studies).  I would recommend it to all believers and followers of Messiah, Yeshua (Jesus).  I would consider this a ""Must Have"", right up there with ""Foot Steps of the Messiah"", by Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum.",1360540800,8,712,4.957983193277311
5559807,4,B00B6FDL8Q,"Brother Salus makes a good scripturally supported case for separating the conflicts outlined in Psalm 83 and Ezekiel 38.  In my opinion, this provides another avenue for understanding eschatological conflict.  This view is at odds with the more dominant understanding that both conflicts describe the same event.  Time will tell which, if either, is correct.  I appreciate Salus's scholarship in putting some context to these prophecies whether or not his hermeneutic is ultimately realized.",1383436800,,491,5.594594594594595
5559808,3,B00B6FDL8Q,"The content of this DVD is very good and well presented, however the quality of the DVD is not so great. The sound fluctuates and requires every skill required to listen.",1378166400,2,170,4.516129032258065
5559809,4,B00B6FDL8Q,This was such a detailed study of Psalm 83.  It show you Israel in prophecy in such a way that you understand how faithful God is to His Word and His promises.  I'll have to listen to this more than once.,1374969600,,204,3.951219512195122
5559810,5,B00B6FDL8Q,As a long time student of bible prophecy I believe this is one of the greatest prophecy books I've read.  It ties together many of the loose ends that have not been explained until now.  If you are just beginning to study prophecy you will be able to understand the current times in which we live.  Can't say enough about what a great book this is.  Just buy it!  You won't be sorry.,1374710400,2,383,4.191780821917808
5559811,5,B00B6FDL8Q,I enjoyed reading what the author had to say in this book about Psalm 83. It puts a new light on things.,1374278400,,104,3.772727272727273
5559812,5,B00B6FDL8Q,"This is a must-read for all who are interested in the events of ""the last days."" It's a comprehensive look at the war in the Middle East which will precede the larger wars of Ezekiel 38 and of Armageddon.",1374192000,,204,4.256410256410256
5559813,4,B00B6FDL8Q,"Bill Salus is quite knowledgeable and an excellent scholar. I would give these DVD's 2 ratings:

Content: 5 Stars - Most informative and will help you look at scripture in a new way, and to be able to interpret today's headlines in light of prophecies written thousands of years ago. Islamic countries - be worried - be very worried about your cursing and opression of Israel. You were warned even in Father Abraham's time but you have not heeded it. Today's Mideast countries are named individually with their ancient names with what is to become of them. Their names have changed but the geography remains the same.

Volume: 2 Stars - Bill Salus has a soft voice anyway and would often trail off into inaudible toward the end of many of his statements. My wife and I probably missed 25% or more of what he had to say because we simply couldn't hear him.

It pains me to be critical of such an excellent product.",1372982400,7,913,4.5212121212121215
5559814,5,B00B6FDL8Q,Thorough and Scriptural.  Good history of Israel and how the End Time players are amassing for the final battle.  Dee,1369699200,3,117,4.8
5559815,5,B00B6FDL8Q,"Did you ever ask yourself why the tiny nation of Israel, (which is listed as the 97th  country in population of the world behind Switzerland) is talked about everyday on the news? Why has the United Nations written more executive orders against Israel than any other nation on earth? Why does the largest nations of China, Russia, United States and Europe (the Quartet) involve themselves with telling Israel what they should and shouldn't do? Why do the Arab nations hate Israel and what is the cause of this hatred? Why did Hitler use all his energy and resources of Germany to kill every Jew in the world? What has the people of  Israel done to deserve this hatred?

I've been studying eschatology for over 30 yrs and was always confused by each authors explanation of the end time events that are coming right before Christ's return to earth. After reading this book by Bill Salus I am not confused any more!!

Bill Salus has researched every ancient named tribe that is listed in the Bible and brought them forward to the 21st century. This book is a page-turner and you will imagine yourself sitting at the table with the secretaries of God as they wrote Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel, Isaiah and Psalm chapters of the Bible and completely understand what God wanted you to know. You will vision yourself watching future events with Russia and the current named Muslim-Arab nations coming to war to eliminate Israel. If you were confused of the end time events listed throughout the Bible just buy and read this book to finally know how events will play out.",1365206400,11,1560,4.724264705882353

8563309,4,B00B6FDL8Q,"This ties in nicely with Rabbi Jonathan Cahns interpretations and the stock market topping actions as forecast by Elliott Wave Theory.  This year is a Shemitah year and we are a few weeks short of midpoint.  Which way will the USA go?  Should we start with our current President?  Or maybe the widening mideast crisis? Perhaps the possibility of Japan versus China?  Chaos is right around the corner.  If Israel is given an ultimatum of surrender or die there is no question of which they will choose.  The mideast will become a radiated desert, but that will not stop terrorists who have their own agenda in targeting America.  911 was only a warning.  I'm not a religious sectarian.  I was trained in Intelligence Analysis in Special Forces and the direction we are heading toward is downward---worldwide.  With regard to Israel becoming a world power, a few decades ago there was a book published titled ""The Mouse That Roared"".",1424304000,,931,4.829113924050633
