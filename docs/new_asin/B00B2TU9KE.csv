I don't want to ruin it but hell does break loose in the second season. If you're into suspense anime, then check out this anime in a whole new level.",1369094400,2,305,4.1
5553260,5,B00B2TU9KE,"Okay, so I just finished both seasons like a week ago with english sub, and enjoyed so much that I thought I would buy it japanese with english sub if need be.  So I get on here and then I realize they are dubbing the series in 2 months....lol *face palm*....I like the characters and even though they could have done with a little more action and less school/cheer up time, the story was interesting enough to keep me watching....even though I had to hang on for the first few episodes....not to mention the 2nd season is a head and shoulders better than the first...it sums up the series pretty good and has a lot more romance...but what can I say, you can't watch the 2nd season without watching the 1st, but the 1st desperately needed the 2nd to clear things up and make things more entertaining.

5553261,2,B00B2TU9KE,"In three episodes. I'm not kidding. Most of this series is utterly pointless and it can be condensed into three episodes. You can literally watch the first couple episodes and then skip to the final episode. You won't really miss much. I came to the end of this series and was totally enraged because it strings you along till then and then you realize how pointless much of this show is. I wanted my 300 minutes back that I wasted on this.

However, lets consider that this is in part, a reverse harem series for girls. The characters themselves are not badly done. But it does follow very predictable story arcs. She is pretty transparent in who she likes from the first episode, which is similar to traditional harem anime on the boys side too. The romance side plays on it's tip toes which is similar to regular harem. Season two is said to make things better but I couldn't stomach to let this series have any more of my time.

Onto to the main story and action, the battles are just way too one sided and this doesn't change. It isn't like others where eventually things get even. It is a common routine of: get butt kicked, feel sad, cheer up time, get macho, charge in, rinse and repeat. Then you have antagonists which are beyond moronic and take their sweet time for no real reason. Which to me is just to make filler till the final episode. Don't get me wrong, stuff happens during the show, but it isn't necessary to draw out the entire series just to make it happen when you have stories this thin. You can argue it is for character building but so many of the characters are so cookie cutter that you really don't need to get to know them. You know the character it is from the moment you meet them!

This is a very underwhelming series. It should have not been given a full season run let alone a season two. But if you haven't seen better then I'm sure this series is anime gold. I'm just warning the rest of you that it'll keep you watching till the end and then you'll realize how poor the show is. If you must, give it a rental to know if it is a show you like. Otherwise stay away from this one. Generic reverse harem mixed with weak supernatural battling and poor storytelling = blech!",1360886400,15,2206,4.336561743341404
5553262,5,B00B2TU9KE,"I'm so glad they've dubbed this! I'm so happy happy happy! lol I originally watched this online with English subtitles and it was sooo good I just loved it. The story line really is great :D Now the romance is there in season one but you can really see it in season two, so that's why I'm hoping this will come out in a second season. I just love this anime! I've already pre ordered I love it so much lol",1359244800,,405,4.012345679012346

I just happened to come across this show one morning and had to keep watching. The story has some romance and comedy mixed in with magic and adventure. There are so many great characters in the story. The scenery is colorful and realistically magical. It takes place during Fall when the leaves are changing colors. The music is amazing and beautiful. I love the theme songs of both seasons. The singer has such a beautiful voice. I'm glad the show continued with another season.",1382140800,8,1240,4.7407407407407405

8561649,2,B00B2TU9KE,"Hi there! I just finished watching this series and I have to say I was very disappointed. The artwork is amazing but the plot is lacking. It got very confusing after episode three and I found myself quickly losing interest in the story. Also, it didn't get very in depth when it came to character backgrounds. I guess since it's similar to Hakuouki, I was expecting more. Again, great artwork but weak plot.",1374278400,2,407,4.589041095890411
