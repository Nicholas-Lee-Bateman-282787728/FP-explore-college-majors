Just about every video outlet should have this picture so check  their racks first. In case you can't rent it then just buy it. The horror  and gore looks campy now but then you're really just watching to be chilled  by the atmosphere which is extremely tight and claustrophobic. It also is a  very good 'period piece'. For the space of that hour and a half you're  aboard that train with the unknowing passengers, cowering from a  pre-neanderthal, alien-activated monster at large. Perhaps the myriad flaws  which plague the film on the surface really just add to its endearing  value. Savalas's performance provides some much-needed comic relief (if you  haven't already split your sides from guffawing at the cheesiness of the  set designs).

I was always leary of the public domain releases of this film, so I was expecting great things from a company like Image Entertainment. I have been a fan of theirs since the laserdisc era, but lately with DVD and now blu-ray...I don't know anymore.
The video of Horror Express is one step above VHS. The image is over matted at 1.85 and pillar boxed (meaning non-anamorphic). At least the image blown up to fill my widescreen tv looks good enough, it could look a whole lot better. Hopefully the blu ray coming out soon will be a better print and transfer.

Was that a train whistle?  Or...something...else?

Peter Cushing unearths a huge, frozen, man-like creature in China.  It's crated and put on a train for Europe where, surprise, it thaws out and breaks loose.

Lucky for us, Cushing is reluctantly paired with rival scientist Christopher Lee (great to see them together even in ""euro-horror trash"") to fight this diabolical creature bent on human destruction.

This sometimes bizarre Spanish production is now a cult fave that has fallen into public domain.

915233,4,6304708432,"One of the underrated gems of classic horror, HORROR EXPRESS is a surprisingly effective chiller that succeeds where many big-budget genre films fail. Headliners Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Telly Savalas guarrantee superlative acting, while the well-handled direction makes the most of the romantic 19th-century trans-Siberian train on which the story unfolds. The plot is simple--anthropologist Lee boxes up a frozen fossil that may be the elusive Missing Link and brings it aboard the eponymous train of the title, where it returns to life and begins preying upon the train's unsuspecting passengers--but blossoms into a many-headed hydra of gothic horror.  The script is refreshingly literate, incorporating the fierce rivalry between religion and science that was perhaps even more bitter in the 1800s than it is today, and there soon proves to be even more to Lee's Missing Link than even he suspects.  The special effects are perfectly adequate and hold up well, but the relative lack of gore compared to today's splatterfests is another check in this little movie's favor.  HORROR EXPRESS is not a Hammer Film, though it should have been, and certainly captures much of Hammer's flavor and style.  And at a compact 88 minutes running time, HORROR EXPRESS isn't spread too thin like many other movies.

Mouth watering creature and camera effects, man this is one creepy entity.

915235,4,6304708432,"I just recently picked up this DVD (mine was from Gemstone Entertainment). I never heard of it before but noticed it starred Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Telly Savalas and was made in 1972. Although this wasn't a Hammer film it obviously had the aura of a Hammer film, and I love Hammer films. So I picked it up (for a buck, no less!).

Ah, what a pleasant surprise!

How can I best describe ""Horror Express""? Okay, imagine if a guy had in his hands the DVDs ""The Thing"" (Carpenter's version), ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" ""Trog,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (huh?) and a few Hammer films with Lee & Cushing. Got that? Okay, now imagine this dude taking a transporter beam back in time to 1972 and re-appearing with only one DVD, a mixture of all the above films. That's pretty much how ""Horror Express"" struck me.

You might be curious as to why I included ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in the list of films; it's because the score in ""Horror Express"" will bring to mind that popular Western composition, except that it's a bit more eerie and fitting for a 1972 horror flick.

Another highlight of the film is that it features two incredibly gorgeous redheads: Helga Line, who was 40 years old at the time, and another cutie that was half Helga's age playing a Countess of some sort.

At 88 minutes the film definitely doesn't overstay its welcome, which can be a good thing.

In its time I bet ""Horror Express"" was cutting-edge horrific entertainment. Today, some of it will strike you as unbelievable (for instance, Lee accepts too quickly the notion that the caveman/fossil is alive and roaming around the train); at other times it will strike you as ridiculous and amusing (it's hard suppressing a giggle here and there, especially when they view dinosaurs through a microscope in the blood of the creature [huh?]). But the film at least takes its subject seriously; it's never campy that's for sure.

If my review piques your interest, don't hesitate to pick up ""Horror Express."" I'm glad I did. (Besides, how can you go wrong at such an ultra-cheap price?)

915237,3,6304708432,"""Horror Express"" is a fairly lame monster movie, made infinitely more viewable by the presence of arch enemies Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Essentially, in 1906 Lee discovers a frozen half man-half ape creature in Siberia whose fossil is immediately pronounced evil by a seemingly rabid priest. He puts the thing on a train across Russia and (surprise) it gets loose and starts killing people methodically.

The plot is fairly hokey, but the old school overacting from the principals is wonderful and there is an occasional bit of suspense wondering where the creature is. There is also a senseless subplot about spies and a formula for steel that helps distract the viewer from the rampaging beast, though why that was desirable as a directorial choice is debatable. There are minimal special effects other than the single glowing red eyeball that can absorb knowledge from a victim through his eyes, and who can store his memories in a liquid inside his own eyeballs. This sounds ridiculous enough (and is) but wait until you see the academics put drops of this eyeball liquid under a microscope and see images (like a brontosaurus) that the creature had seen in the past.

The print is dark and a bit grainy, but overall it's a lot of fun for aficionados of classic gothic horror movies set on a train.",1157500800,6,1311,4.848214285714286
915238,4,6304708432,"Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were ""the best of screen enemies"" (to quote Lee). So it's entertaining to see them in a different kind of movie, such as ""Horror Express,"" a somewhat hokey horror movie that is made up for by some excellent performances and pervasive creepiness. You'll never look at a fossil quite the same way again.

Professor Saxton (Christopher Lee) uncovers a frozen ape-man in northern China, and has it crated and loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express. But after his colleague Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing) bribes the baggage man to peek inside, the baggage man is found dead, with bloody white eyes -- and the fossil is gone. More people fall prey to the creature before it's fatally shot by a Russian police officer.

But it soon becomes apparent that the creature may be dead -- but whatever was inside it has just moved on to its next host. Wells and Saxton try to puzzle out what they are dealing with, while a mad monk (Alberto de Mendoza) tries to help the possessed officer, believing him to be Satan. To top things off, a force of Cossack soldiers have arrived to deal with the threat...

""Horror Express"" is one of those movies that would normally be B-grade all around -- capable, but nothing really memorable. The plot about a bodysnatching, memory-sucking alien is kinda hokey. But it's the presentation that makes it really interesting, with Lee and Cushing as a pair of scientists, and a sense of mystery around what the creature really is.

And it all takes place in the confines of a train, which gives the movie a claustrophobic feeling, as well as making it seem a bit like a horror version of ""Murder on the Orient Express."" The dialogue ranges from silly (""There's a stink of hell on this train!"") to slyly satirical (""But what if one of you is the monster?"" ""Monster? We're BRITISH, you know!"").

Lee and Cushing are the bright spots in here, as the uptight, scientific-minded Saxton and the friendly Wells, who keeps rubbing Saxton the wrong way.  It's interesting to see them as allies (""friends"" would be pushing it), and the the two actors give plenty of little details to their strong performances. Dracula and Van Helsing, they ain't. And Telly Savalas shows up briefly as a swaggering, likable Cossack captain.

It should be noted that the Geneon/Pioneer release of this movie is actually quite good for the price. No real extras, but the print is clean, clear and the colour hasn't faded. The only problem with this edition is that the menu is REALLY annoying, with a train whistle blowing every few seconds, and there's no captioning.

""Horror Express"" is basically a B-movie with the usual weak and solid moments, but some grade-A talent making it worthwhile. Enjoyably spooky.",1153699200,3,2729,4.791489361702127
915239,4,6304708432,"Horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are booked on the Trans-Siberian Express? There's a beautiful Countess onboard, too? And Telly Savalas shows up and absolutely steals the show? You'd better believe I bought my ticket for this wild ride. Despite a really, really hokey premise, a rather dark movie print, and a lack of major special effects, Horror Express somehow comes off quite well as a traditional sort of horror film with a quality all its own. The setting is the winter of 1906; Sir Alexander Saxon (Christopher Lee) has discovered a two-million-year-old ""man"" in the frozen wastes of China that may very well be the crucial ""missing link."" Before his men can even get the precious cargo loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express, a nosy little thief ends up dead, his eyeballs completely white. It just so happens that a Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), a scientist not unknown to Saxon, is also a passenger on the train, and his curiosity about the strange crate leads to the baggage man's death. When the remarkably living creature escapes and begins a real killing spree aboard the train, rivals Saxon and West team up to try and stop the rampage of the monster. After they saw the heads off of several white-eyed victims, they are amazed to find brains that are wholly smooth. You know what this means, of course - the creature is somehow sucking the very thoughts out of his victim's brains through their eyes. This helps explain the bleeding from the eyes that also seems to accompany death. Just for kicks, the two scientists take a look at a sample of eye fluid from a victim - and what should appear on the slide but the spitting image of the last thing the victim saw. Then they look at a sample from the monster's eye (the monster has transferred his consciousness to another human being by this point, having had his initial host body pumped full of several holes); visions of ancient creatures and a vision of earth from space leads to the obvious conclusion that what we are dealing with here is a living intelligence who came to earth eons ago. In the movie's defense, the idea that the last image a person sees before he dies would be imprinted upon his eyeball was actually entertained by some thinkers as late as the early twentieth century.

From here on out, it's basically a struggle for all the panicked train riders to avoid meeting up with a pair of glowing red eyes until such time as our heroes, Saxon and West, can identify and kill the creature in whatever form he now possesses. A gorgeous Countess and her annoying Rasputin-like associate add to the fun, but it is the appearance of Telly Savalas in the role of Captain Kazan that breathes new life into the final half hour of the film. Savalas gives an unforgettable performance, obviously enjoying the role of the campy Cossack to the hilt. He doesn't appear for very long, but he packs loads of entertainment into that short time period, doing everything but bringing out a lollipop and asking someone ""Who loves you, baby?""

In a sense, this is not one of Cushing's or Lee's better performances, in my opinion. Together as allies for once, though, their dual presence carries this film on its shoulders. Other than a filthy creature sporting the worst case of pinkeye you've ever seen, many shots of ""ping-pong ball for eyes"" victims, and a couple of cranial autopsy procedures, there's not much gore to be found here. The story sounds rather weak but holds itself together quite well, helped immensely by the very presence of the great Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.

Isn't it possible that it did this by inhabiting the body of another? - but not before the creature had sucked out the memory from the brain of the last victim.",1097712000,,586,4.336363636363636
915307,4,6304708432,"Horror Express (1974), aka Panic in the Trans-Siberian Train, stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in one of their many collaborations on film (22, in fact) and is certainly an interesting mix of science fiction and horror, providing a lot more than I would have expected, given this particular version comes from Image Entertainment's Euroshock Collection.  I've never been a really big fan of European horror, specifically from the period of the late sixties through the late 80's, as I've found it more often than not a little too visceral, i.e. gory, for my tastes.  I can understand the appeal to those who love that kind of thing, but I've felt extreme violence can work just as well, if not better, if it's implied, rather than shown, given that the director is any good at his/her craft.  My imagination is a whole lot scarier than anything I've ever seen on screen, but I digress...

This Spanish production, directed by Eugeno Martin, takes place in the early 20th century, and begins with Professor Alexander Saxton (Lee), an anthropologist, finding an ancient frozen man-beast somewhere in Manchuria, I think...anyway, he crates it up for transport and future study back in his native England, and proceeds to take it with him on the Trans-Siberian Express, where he meets an acquaintance in Dr, Wells (Cushing), and his assistant whose name I forget but she reminded me a lot of that creepy little troll woman  from Poltergeist (1982).  As they embark on their journey by train across the frozen tundra, murdered victims begin popping up.  The method of their deaths is particularly strange, as they don't seem to have been killed by any conventional methods, and their eyes always appear opaque, with a bit of blood emanating from their various facial orifices, eyes, nose, mouth, etc.  It's soon learned that Professor Saxton's discovery, a seemingly fossilized creature, has come back to life, and is the cause of the deaths.  The exact nature of the creature may surprise you (maybe not, as I think some have already give it away).  What are its' motives?

I actually enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.  I was put off by thoughts of it being a European horror film, my reasons already explained, but I gave it a chance as I really enjoy Lee and Cushing, and having them together is a real bonus.  That's not to say every film they been in separately or together is a winner, but this is certainly better than average (if you want to see some real stinkers, check out The Bloody Judge (1970) or the Fu Manchu films of the late 60's.  They gained a little from his appearance in them, but not much.)  The overall story had a plot, and it did manage to follow it quite well.  If you are a fan of early 50's sci-fi, you will probably see a lot of commonalities in this film compared to some of those, one more famous one in particular, finally released to DVD by Warner Brothers in late 2003.  The European horror elements (blood!) come in the form of blood emanating from the victim's eyes, nose, and mouth during the process of being killed, and isn't as graphic as I would have thought (no entrails being ate up and such, but there is a little brain exploration as various victims suffer the indignity of an autopsy in the baggage car of the train).  The real reason to see this film is for Lee and Cushing, as they can often take trash and spin gold.  That's not to say this movie would have been trash without them, as I think it's pretty solid, but their appearances make selling this Spanish production certainly a lot easier in the international market.  And let's not forget Telly Salavas (Who loves ya, baby?).  He appears as Captain Kazan, a brutal, ruthless Cossack who boards the train with his troops in order to investigate the murders.  His screen time is limited, which is too bad, as he had one of the more interesting roles, but what he lacks in time on the screen he makes up for in a memorable performance.

I did feel a little awkwardness in the plot as some elements seemed to be tied in and together in fairly flimsy fashion, and particularly elements arose a bit too conveniently for my tastes, but these issues were pretty minor in the context of the film.  The special effects were actually pretty good.  The use of miniatures to show the train moving on looked quaint (for better or for worse) and gave a certain charm to the film.  The claustrophobic nature of nearly the entire film being shot on sets meant to be the interior of the train helped keep the tension throughout, as escape into the vast, frozen wasteland was not a possibility.  Also, the elegance of the interiors, specifically the first class cars, played nicely against the horror of the creature originally stuck riding in the baggage car (I thought maybe he was just looking for space in the first class compartments, but his greed was so much more).  The creature itself really wasn't that frightening to me, but then I think years of horror films and such have desensitized my reactions to such stimuli.  It did remind me of a dirtier, unkempt Grinch, with matted and mottled fur.

The wide screen print used for this DVD does show a good number of flaws, mainly scratches and signs of lack of preservation.  It's not too bad, and doesn't hinder one's ability to watch, but every now and again you may be taken out of the film but an obtrusive defect.  Not much in the form of special features, but this version does have the option of watching the film with only the music and sound effects, no dialog...very odd...there's extensive liner notes on the case flap worth reading for historical info on the film.

...like buy it already.
 As for the movie itself, yes it does have two horror icons in possibly there best movie ever, but it also serves as a very kool tribute of sorts to H.P. Lovecraft, the plot is great, I had no problems with the acting, the white eyes were great, and it kept me interested all the way, though be warned action fans, there is no action here, just an evolving tale with character developement, better stick with your Independance Day crap if that ain't your thing, it has aliens and product placement, not to mention a cheesey corprate sound track all of which is void from this awsome movie! :)
 WARNING, PLOT LEAK AHEAD!!!!
 Ok, so Lee finds this frozen monster which he thinks will explain a vital part of man's past. He loads it up on a train, and the monster escapes, and begins to kill, they kill the monster, ect ect. But...
...the murders continue, and every victum is found with his eyes completely white, and his brain void of any wrinkles or memories. Along the way they discover that the monster was an alien older than mankind itself, and is capable of transfering itself into other living beings. On top of that, it can also absorb all the information out of a human's brain, and know what they know, giving it an upper hand in survival and blending in with everyone on the train.
 The aspect I really enjoyed about this is the Kristian Fanatic! The guy strongly resembles the street person who claims the cube at the end of the 1st (and only true) Hell Raiser film. On top of this Lee and Cushing are persistant to prove to him that his beliefs are all a bunch of idiotic superstition.
When they discover that the alien's cut out eye, contains image imprints of the various things it has seen, and that one of them is a view of the planet Earth from space, they instantly call for the Fanatic to have a look in the micro-scope, and as anyone with blind faith would do, he instantly starts rambling about how it is the eye of Satan, and is a vision of him being cast out from Heaven. What makes this even more awsome and darker is the fact that he steals the eye, and is later corned in the same room with the alien, where he watches it kill a lady, then comes out from hiding, and throws himself before it, asking if it were going to kill him too, at which it replys that there is nothing in his head that he would find useful! And just to step it up a tad bit more, the fanatic gives the eye to the alien so no one else will see it, then goes are far to begin worshipping the alien and becomes its servent, and eventually the ""temple for its soul""!
 Can't beat that for $5.00.

915370,4,6304708432,"One more time for the Transsiberian train to become the hero of a film. The core of the story is quite interesting, though it has been used by quite a few authors and directors : some form of energy coming from outspace survives on the earth by getting hosted by some animal form. This energy can move from one being to another and it can also absorb all the knowledge anyone has though this absorption will kill the victim. A cross between extraterrestrial energy and vampiristic killing. Put such a being in a train rushing through Siberia and it becomes very fascinating : the reactions of the people, the people themselves, the shock between these people and a couple of Cossacks, etc. Agatha Christie used that situation very well in her Orient Express. This film also shows how scientists and doctors are more interested in science than in human beings and that they may take risks, for others as well as for themselves, in order to gain some fundamental knowledge. This is still true and the social and ethical responsibility of scientists is always and has always to be questioned. The end is a little bit disappointing : to destroy the monster and all evidence in a train crash is not very creative at all, and it is a little bit fast and skimpy. Too bad. But the film is otherwise entertaining. After all we need to come to an end in a way or another.

915372,4,6304708432,"Horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are booked on the Trans-Siberian Express?  There's a beautiful Countess onboard, too?  And Telly Savalas shows up and absolutely steals the show?  You'd better believe I bought my ticket for this wild ride.  Despite a really, really hokey premise, a rather dark movie print, and a lack of major special effects, Horror Express somehow comes off quite well as a traditional sort of horror film with a quality all its own.  The setting is the winter of 1906; Sir Alexander Saxon (Christopher Lee) has discovered a two-million-year-old ""man"" in the frozen wastes of China that may very well be the crucial ""missing link.""  Before his men can even get the precious cargo loaded on the Trans-Siberian Express, a nosy little thief ends up dead, his eyeballs completely white.  It just so happens that a Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), a scientist not unknown to Saxon, is also a passenger on the train, and his curiosity about the strange crate leads to the baggage man's death.  When the remarkably living creature escapes and begins a real killing spree aboard the train, rivals Saxon and West team up to try and stop the rampage of the monster.  After they saw the heads off of several white-eyed victims, they are amazed to find brains that are wholly smooth.  You know what this means, of course - the creature is somehow sucking the very thoughts out of his victim's brains through their eyes.  This helps explain the bleeding from the eyes that also seems to accompany death.  Just for kicks, the two scientists take a look at a sample of eye fluid from a victim - and what should appear on the slide but the spitting image of the last thing the victim saw.  Then they look at a sample from the monster's eye (the monster has transferred his consciousness to another human being by this point, having had his initial host body pumped full of several holes); visions of ancient creatures and a vision of earth from space leads to the obvious conclusion that what we are dealing with here is a living intelligence who came to earth eons ago.  In the movie's defense, the idea that the last image a person sees before he dies would be imprinted upon his eyeball was actually entertained by some thinkers as late as the early twentieth century.
From here on out, it's basically a struggle for all the panicked train riders to avoid meeting up with a pair of glowing red eyes until such time as our heroes, Saxon and West, can identify and kill the creature in whatever form he now possesses.  A gorgeous Countess and her annoying Rasputin-like associate add to the fun, but it is the appearance of Telly Savalas in the role of Captain Kazan that breathes new life into the final half hour of the film.  Savalas gives an unforgettable performance, obviously enjoying the role of the campy Cossack to the hilt.  He doesn't appear for very long, but he packs loads of entertainment into that short time period, doing everything but bringing out a lollipop and asking someone ""Who loves you, baby?""
In a sense, this is not one of Cushing's or Lee's better performances, in my opinion.  Together as allies for once, though, their dual presence carries this film on its shoulders.  Other than a filthy creature sporting the worst case of pinkeye you've ever seen, many shots of ""ping-pong ball for eyes"" victims, and a couple of cranial autopsy procedures, there's not much gore to be found here.  The story sounds rather weak but holds itself together quite well, thanks largely to the inestimably grand performances by the great Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.

915374,4,6304708432,"Possibly among Hammer's very best productions, HORROR EXPRESS is notable for casting Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing as (reluctant) allies for once, & also for ""co-starring"" Telly Savalas pre-KOJAK; who previously worked with director Eugenio Martin on the film PANCHO VILLA. Scripted by Arnaud D'Usseau & Julian Halevy from a story by Gene Martin, the film is also known as PANIC ON THE TRANS-SIBERIAN EXPRESS.

Alexander Saxton (Lee) is a scientist who leads an expedition into the mountains where he discovers the frozen body of a huge ape-like man (No, it's not Tor Johnson). The valuable fi(e)nd is shipped aboard a train bound for Europe, where Saxton plans to conduct research that could establish the ""missing link"" between humans and primates.  But to Saxton's annoyance his rival Dr. Wells (Cushing) and his assistant are also passengers on the train.
Matters soon get hairy (quite literally) when a potential thief picks the lock on the crate; resulting in the ape-man being let loose aboard the train- but not before hypnotizing the culprit & sucking all information & memories from his brain, leaving him with hemhorraging eyeballs that resemble bloodied boiled eggs and a brain smoother & whiter than Telly Savalas's head.
Another passenger on the train is a wacko hippie priest who believes this is the work of the devil and that the contents of the crate is ""unholy"", as all uninformed nincompoops do when confronted with things they don't understand or that don't conform to their personal belief system. The preacher presents a rock solid argument in his favor when he remarks ""There is the stink of hell on this train. Even the dog knows it"". (NB: There IS in fact a dog on board too, who is obviously smarter than the Hellfire Hippie.)

Also amusing is the following exchange between Cushing & Lee when the creature escapes:
Cushing: ""Are you telling me that an ape that lived two million years ago got out of that crate, killed the baggage man and put him in there; then loaded everything up neat and tidy, and got away?""
Lee: ""YES! I AM!"".
In case you're wondering, I haven't forgotten about Telly Savalas. In spite of his co-star billing he doesn't appear in his role as Captain Kazak until the last third of the movie; unless as I also mentioned, the film makers used his dome for ""brain"" close-ups.
DVD extras include trailers and a bio and filmography for Lee, but none for Cushing, which is odd. This DVD obviously offers nothing special in terms of special features but it's loads of fun and a good bargain for collectors.",1059436800,2,2550,4.844036697247707
915375,4,6304708432,"I am biased, I admit it.  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are fantastic actors, and I will watch anything they perform in.  Much like the late actor Donald Pleasence, they somehow manage to elevate their horror pictures above drivel, into fun and interesting movies to watch.  Of course there are exceptions, but usually I cannot find fault with a Lee/Cushing picture, they are worth the price of admission as pure entertainment.
Now, on to this movie.  It was a blast.  It was a ball.  It was fantastic fun, and creepy camera work.  It was a truly great horror entertainment.  Lee and Cushing thrown together with Telly Savales (terrible, terrible portrayal of a cossack, if I ever saw one, but funny none-the-less.  Imagine Kojak tossing out a Russian familiarity name ""little grandfather"".  It's just too bizarre.) against a trainful of cossack zombies and a yeti/missing link monster with glow in the dark eyes and the ability to erase memories (as well as kill you really good.)

This film was also previously released by Simitar and that version has gone out of print. A release by Caligula may still be availabe, but was of poorer quality.

First the picture was only a modest widescreen production and has been correctly framed in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:66:1. This alone improves a number of shots. The picture, while still not pristine, is much sharper than the previous releases I have seen. There was still some damage to the print, but this film is now over thirty years old. A major restoration aside, alas very unlikely, this is about as good as it is going to get.
The sound was a strong two channel mono available in both English and Spanish. The haunting ""Whistling Theme"" was well presented. There is also a seperate music and effects track. The Image version also includes the full musical prelude and exit music missing off the other editions. DVD extras are limited to the additional audio tracks and a couple pages of filmography for both of the stars who really make this train go.

I saw it again on video because I have recently become a big fan of British horror film actor Christopher Lee.  I highly recommend this movie.
In the mountains of early twentieth-century Manchuria, archaeologist Christopher Lee discovers a frozen ape man.  Unaware that the find is possessed by an alien life form, Lee transports the discovery on a passenger train and havoc ensues when the creature thaws out.
Some parts of ""Horror Express"" are downright ridiculous.  The medical science in the movie is absolutely laughable.  Telly Salavas hams it up and plays a Russian cossack almost as if he were police lieutenant Theo Kojak(Coincidentally, Savalas' character in the movie is named ""Kazak"").
Nevertheless, I must admit that ""Horror Express"" still manages to be a very frightening and entertaining movie.  When I was a child, I had a lot of trouble sleeping on the night that I saw it.  I also had a lot of fun seeing Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing both playing good guys in the same movie.  The film also features an eerie and creepy whistling tune that will never leave your head.
A must-see for all horror fans.",994809600,,1277,4.825688073394495
915496,4,6304708432,"The main attraction in this 1972 Spanish film is the cast, since not only do we get Christopher Lee as Professor Alexander Saxton and Peter Cushing as Dr. Welles, but Telly Savalas as Captain Kazan.  Apparently, before there was life on earth an energy being ended up on Earth and was patiently possessing various life forms wanting for man to develop.  Unfortunately, the primitive man inhabited by the alien being was trapped in a glacier.  Jump ahead to 1906, and Professor Saxon discovers the frozen being and is transporting it back to civilization on the Trans-Siberian Railroad (think ""Murder on the Orient Express"" meets ""The Thing"").  The creature escapes and starts killing, jumping bodies as its host is killed.  That is when things start getting weird.  How weird?  Well, the alien's victims become zombies, which happens after it absorbs their memories through a process that, ah, boils their eyeballs (you cannot make this stuff up).  Meanwhile, the Professor and the Doctor have discovered that the eyeball fluid of the thawed corpse primitive man (remember him?) contains microscopic pictures of its memories, which means pictures of dinosaurs and earth from space.  Then the movie gets back to the slaughter.
This plot by director Eugenio Martin and Arnaud D'Usseau is just so audacious you have to enjoy it.  But actually the main treat is Cushing and Lee, finally freed from the constraints of their Hammer characters and just having a good old time acting their way through this mess.  Of course the supporting cast look like refugees from a spaghetti western, which certainly makes sense.  ""Horror Express"" is certainly a lot better than most of the Hammer films Cushing and Lee made during the last half of the Sixties.  Track down this film and screen it for your next Friday Night Horror Flick party, maybe as a double-bill with ""Terror Train""?  You could do worse.",991267200,,1889,4.993610223642173
915497,4,6304708432,"The four stars I gave this movie is in its context as a 70's Horror period piece.
 It's unusual setting, winter in Eastern Russia, only adds to the creepy sense that the people here are abandoned and on their own devices. Slowly stalked and murdered gruesomely (but not gorily) by some nameless horror the passnegers struggle to cope.
 This is good old fashioned Horror fun. The kind of movie that you could take your girlfriend to see at the Drive-in and have her crawling to you for comfort. A movie in which you willingly suspend your disbelief. Alas those days are gone. With everyone expecting to see world class CGI and 18-wheeled belly-loaders full of gore the audiences have largely become too desensitized to appreciate the good old creepy thrillers that Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee were so good at. Today's so-called Horror films have no dialog or story, just endlessly more gruesome attempts at visually overwhelming shock.
 Much of this movie is silly. This is also irrelevant. The acting is just sufficiently over-the-top to make it convincing. Buy this movie, if you like true Horror at all. For this is Horror, not the slasher dreck that dominates the screen today. Be warned though. When you compare the acting talents of the great horror actors of the past (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Vincent Price, Boris Karlof, etc.) you will forever look upon our current crop of so-called actors that attempt Horror with contempt.",978480000,,1446,4.94238683127572

915501,5,6304708432,"This film has a good plot about an alien (inside a frozen animal) found by British scientist Christopher Lee in China. Lee travels from China to England via Russia on a train with his frozen find, and at a train station,  he meets fellow British scientist Peter Cushing and his assistant Ms Jones  also travelling back to England via the same train. While Lee is arguing  with the train ticket official about not having his seat reserved three  weeks in advance, a Chinese thief breaks into the crate containing Lee's  frozen animal but is later found killed, with his eyes all white. A police  inspector, Mirov, investigates this strange death, and together with a  fanatical priest, Pujardov, both are suspicious of Lee's crate although  they do not know what is inside it. Both men travel on the same train. A  Russian countess, Irina, askes the baggage official to keep a silver bar  safe in the train's storage, and her dog is afraid of Lee's crate. Cushing  is curious and bribes the train baggage official to open it to tell him  what is inside.  Whilst the train is travelling, the official removes some  screws from the crate and sees a hand from within the crate opening the  crate's lock using a bent screw (like a thief would do to open a lock). He  tries to stop this but sees the animal's face (which has a red eye) and  dies with his eyes becoming white.  Mirov askes Lee and Cushing where the  baggage official is. Lee says he does not know, and Cushing tells Mirov  that his disappearance may have to do with the crate, which now seems all  wrapped up, like is was when loaded earlier. Lee is annoyed at Cushing and  throws the crate's lock's key instead of giving it to Mirov. Mirov has  Konyack, the train's ticket inspector, break the lock using an axe and they  discover the baggage official dead. Mirov locks up Lee and demands that no  one speak of this.  While two of Mirov's guards are searching for the  monster, one is killed by it, and Mirov askes Cushing for help. Cushing and  Jones perform an autopsy on the baggage official and, together with Mirov,  discover his brain having few wrinkles left (as it the brain had all its  memory drained).  A female spy, Natasha, breaks into the baggage safe to  steal the silver bar but is disturbed and killed by the monster hiding in  the baggage carriage. While Cushing is searching for her (as she is sharing  his room), he finds her dead and is saved from the monster by Mirov killing  it with his gun, although it transfers its intelligence into him. The  monster is found holding the silver bar (like a spy would do). An autopsy  on Natasha shows the same brain symptoms.  Lee is suspicious of Mirov when  Mirov tells Konyack that he saw the silver bar put into the safe - only  Lee, Cushing, Irina, and the baggage official saw the silver being put into  the safe. Lee helps Cushing and Jones to study the monster's red eye (now  looking like a normal eye) and they discover it to contain prehistoric  images and an image of Earth from space. Irina is curious and sees the  images too, with her employee, Purjadov. While the train travels through a  tunnel, the lights go out and Purjadov steals the eye to give it to Mirov,  whom he knows to be the monster. Mirov destroys the eye and kills Jones  when she discovers his true identity. Lee and Cushing are puzzled to find  Jones dead with white eyes as they saw the monster dead.  Mirov kills an  engineer/scientist who may know how to overcome Earth's gravity (as the  monster's intention is to leave Earth and return to its home planet).  Passengers are now afraid but Mirov vows to shoot anyone leaving the train.  Lee asks Konyack to contact soldiers at a remote train station for help,  and tells this to Mirov. Mirov then kills Konyack. At the train station,  Russian soldiers, lead by Telly Savalas as their captain, board the train  and interrogate the passengers as the train departs. Savalas is suspicious  of Mirov when Purjadov protects him, and Lee reduces the lights, revealing  Mirov as the monster with two red eyes. Both he and Purjadov flee from  everyone and Savalas orders everyone to leave as he and his soldiers will  kill both fugitives. Mirov is dying (after being shot by the soldiers while  fleeing) and transfers the alien intelligence in Purjadov, who willing  accepts it. He returns to kills all soldiers, including Savalas, leaving  them with all white eyes. Purjadov then kills Irina's Count husband to  steal silver's formula (from his brain) but is stopped by Lee from killing  Irina. Both Lee and Irina escape the zombie soldiers, Train officials have  been ordered to send the train over a cliff. Lee and Cushing release the  baggage car, with themselves and all living passengers it, from the rest of  the train, before it goes over the cliff, even though Purjadov, as train  driver (having killed the original train driver) tries to stop the train.  Purjadov dies in the flames.",962064000,3,4943,4.641203703703703
915502,5,6304708432,"There was a reason Peter Cushing (unfortunately probably best known in this country for STAR WARS) and Christopher Lee were such stars in certain circles--they were GREAT actors. I wish I could rehash some of the terrific  dialogue, but I don't think either of them would approve (poor manners).  This movie has so many things going for it. There are ridiculously  beautiful women in it (Silvia Tortosa in particular as the Countess), a  familiarity with and reverence for the history of the genre and the  possiblities of good science fiction (I believe the bespectacled engineer  mentions having studied under 19th century Russian rocketry pioneer  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky), historical accuracy (the squalid, frantic  atmosphere and pace of a Chinese railway station in the grips of European  economic imperialism, complete with British customs officer), and fantastic  scenes. I don't think those are crucial plot elements, so I guess they're  okay. One thing that still bothers me: what was the deal with Peter  Cushing's grim-looking American assistant? I mean, it was interesting, but  what was the rationale?

7876183,4,6304708432,"I accidentally purchased this standard DVD version not realizing that a Blu-Ray version was out there. Therefore I will do a better review after I purchase that edition.

I'll briefly comment on the movie. It might seem from my comments below that this movie is poorly done. But it is not. I'm just pointing out it's flaws. There is a lot of 'good' in this movie.

This movie was very well done. It has horror legends Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee teaming up and in this case they really are teaming up. In most movies they are not on the same side or both protaganists.

You will have to suspend belief to watch this one. The premise is quite fantastical. An ancient alien was left behind on earth eons ago and has survived by taking over the bodies of animals on earth starting with singular cell animals and transferring to different bodies throughout the ages. He then gets left stuck in an a fossilized body in Manchuria where the remains are discovered and put on the Trans-Siberian Express to be brought back to Europe. Once on the train this alien takes control of a body and absorbs the intelligence of anybody it chooses by sucking its thoughts through they eyes. Preposterous? Yes, certainly. But once you get past that, the movie is quite good.

Another problem is the ending. Once again, you will have to suspend belief for this.

I know by my brief comments that his movie seems ridiculous but the plot unfolds in an interesting way that is not typical of every other horror movie.

You also get Telly Savalas! To my eyes it almost seemed like an anachronism seeing 'Kojak' with thick American accent and all dressed up as a Cossack and jumping on board. In a way it is comical, yet the role is a serious one.
