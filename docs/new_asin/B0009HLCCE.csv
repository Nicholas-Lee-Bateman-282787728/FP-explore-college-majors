Certainly not like BTCC or WTCC with alot of action.  We don't get to see alot if any of the Japanese racing in North America so I was looking for an action packed DVD.  It has some short moments and that was it.  I was disappointed.",1250553600,,329,4.015384615384615
8515242,4,B0009HLCCE,"I bought this to get a closer look at these ""Super Cars"" R34 GTR Z33 Mrk IV Supra Lambo's Ferrari Porche WRX STI's ect..., you get video from inside the cockpit and automotive specs, interviews with the japanese drivers, who talk about thier views on japanese vs. U.S. cars. As well as a couple of pretty good races. Nascar may go 200 and above miles an hour, but these are just more fun to watch, and they are still going 150+ mph. You have the GT300 (300hp) class racing at the same time as the GT500 (500hp)class. Which means the 500's have to be that much better. More intense in my opinion, a definate must have.",1156032000,2,617,4.327586206896552
