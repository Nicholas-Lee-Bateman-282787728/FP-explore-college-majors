8107871,5,B000E9ZF1G,One of the best that I have seen on the subject of anger in a Christian's life.  Lisa is open and transparent with her own journey and I believe it can be beneficial to anyone who is interested in this subject.,1417737600,,210,4.121951219512195
8107872,5,B000E9ZF1G,"This series was shown at our church on Wednesday education night through a coordinating class.  When I first started, I went there with the intention of dealing with my hurt because of angry people around me.  I was sulken, withdrawn, shy, and a little reluctant to participate.  However, when our pastoral counselor popped in the first tape, there was Lisa right up in front giving us her testimony.  Throughout the series, it builds on every aspect of anger, Lisa's testimony of healing, the power of confession, knowing when to stop it before it gets out of hand, letting it go and releasing yourself of any guilt, putting it into practice within your relationships, anger and depression, and anger and fear.

We only have one more session to go, ""anger and fear,"" and our whole group has shown enthusiasm on what it will contain.  I feel Lisa Bevere has single-handedly (well with God of course, too!) changed my perspective of who I should be in order to live a good, Christian life.  On almost every tape, she cites an example from her own life and husband and children, and in our class almost everyone can relate.  It is very practical, very sound, and oriented toward Christ with an emphasis on specific scripture passages that will just amaze when you figure out where they fit into your life.

Even though I am almost through viewing these video tapes at my church group, I am planning on buying them now too, for my own personal use and to share with friends and family.",1139443200,7,1482,4.6692307692307695
