6445909,4,B00KTFJ6RE,"This product would have gotten the full five stars if it had unedited episodes. Rescue at Midnight Castle and Escape from Catrina are missing at least one song each. The argument that the original version don't exist can be stated, but someone out there may have unedited versions and SHOUT! Factory and Hasbro could have contacted people and made a search for copies of these unedited episodes to use. But they didn't, so if you're hoping for unedited versions, don't buy this. Buy it simply because it at least is G1 My Little Pony, the start of the whole phenomenon that led up to G4 My Little Pony.

Addendum to the bit about unedited episodes: At one point the unedited versions of these episode did exist on Youtube, but they were pulled because of copyright infringement. This points to the fact that somebody having the versions unedited if they are uploading them online to such sites as Youtube.",1412294400,14,905,4.727848101265823
6445910,2,B00KTFJ6RE,"I ordered this version because the last DVD I bought edited the Mr. Moochik song in Rescue From Midnight Castle. This version is even worse, the entire song is cut out!",1412121600,6,168,4.451612903225806
6445911,4,B00KTFJ6RE,"I will confirm that this is the TELEVISION version of the episodes.  So yup, Good Old Days has been cut again... as it is not the Special version of the episode.  Sadly it may forever be as such; it may have only been released to TV studios and no official copy may remain. :(

The video quality of the show looks excellent on the other hand; crisp for such an old show.  So think fresh release VHS copy of as one would have watched it when it first came out on TV in the 1980's.  I'm not fully disappointed at it, I only paid $10 for my copy at my local WalMart; I'm sad that its just the TV versions of the show but I still love them and happily add this to my collection.",1412035200,10,674,3.962962962962963
6445912,4,B00KTFJ6RE,"I've watched this show since I was two, and even though I'm in my twenties, I still like watching it. The only problem with this show coming out on DVD is thatthe last time it came out on DVD, it skpped a part during the show. Luckily, it's coming from another DVD company. Maybe Shout! Factory will do better with this one, because I hate shows that skip parts.",1402790400,5,362,4.260869565217392

6445916,4,B00KTFJ6RE,"well Got this Dvd . And watched it. The Series is the way I remember it when I watched it on tv. There Are No songs Missing from Each epsoides. Only thing not there is the second half when the show was seen on tv. Like Glo Friends, Potoes Head Kids ,I did check Wiki the shows was menton. But I think Glo Friends Series They probably couldn,t find it. Its not on youtube  Hopefully someone recorded that show on VHS so it can be on the Dvd . Now these cartoons like Glo friends, POtoes Head Kids I can,t think of theother I check on wiki it says these shows was Franchize Hasbro Products Of course it will not be with The My little Pony tv classic collection.i think Potoes Head Kids might have their own dvd series.by itself. Only thing wrong with it. is The FIrst Series This Epsoide Escape From Catrina . The Catrina Is misspelled its suppose to be spell like this Katrina I have the same epsoide on a vhs tape which was recorded from tv.now the first part of the series the title were reeditied when they wrote Escape From Catrina They forgot to add Part 1 on the title. It was suppose to be written likethis Escape from Katrina Part 1. another issue the  endcredits and Cast Of the players seemed to show after each epsoide end. this is how it is Part 1 then End Of the song Credits than part 2 End of the song Credits.doing the airing on tv each show of my little pony are 20 to 23 minutes long. usally the cast suppose to show after the 23 minutes epsoides.other than that its a great dvd. each epsoides on the dvd have the whole entire story. so basically you get probably if you put the series togather you might have 6 my little pony series epsoides most of the series have 2 parts so I think the dvd is longer than 110 min.",1445212800,,1734,4.173134328358209
6445917,3,B00KTFJ6RE,"It is good, but sadly, it looks like there are scenes missing and the quality isn't super great.
I honestly could live with iffy quality (it is from the 80's and all) but cutting out an Mr. Moochick's entire musical number from Escape from Midnight Castle was when I just couldn't watch it anymore.",1439078400,2,298,4.537037037037037
6445918,4,B00KTFJ6RE,Daughter loved this movie! It wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I saw it. It seems like some of the movie I remember as a child got cut out to make it shorter...which is a major bummer but at least my daughter still enjoys it.,1434240000,,233,4.086956521739131

6445922,4,B00KTFJ6RE,"I bought the complete series and realized it was missing songs. I bought this hoping it would have the missing songs included in the episodes but it did not. It's exactly the same as what the complete series has. So, while this product is good, I would suggest just getting the whole series. Very disappointed that neither had the missing songs.",1426896000,3,345,4.672131147540983

8661313,2,B00KTFJ6RE,"Really bummed out by one of the movies, which they incorrectly cut in to two episodes, deleting the middle portion of the movie.  It was the only reason I ordered it for my kids.",1515110400,,178,4.235294117647059

8661315,3,B00KTFJ6RE,This contains episodes from the TV series but is a waste of money considering if you want to purchase the TV series on DVD anyway as these short videos are already included in those. Just buy the TV series instead of buying this DVD that way you'll get to view a lot more.,1495411200,,272,4.150943396226415

8661317,5,B00KTFJ6RE,"This is one of my daughter's favorite movies. It was also one of mine when I was a kid. The movie is exactly as I remember it. The sound, quality and everything is perfect. The first movie I received was broken when I opened it. They were very quick to get me a refund so I could reorder it.",1483574400,,291,3.9491525423728815
8661318,3,B00KTFJ6RE,"This was my absolute favorite when I was little! I had it on VHS and watched it endlessly, it drove my parents mad. I even still have the VHS but it doesn't really play anymore but I couldn't bare to throw it away. I was so excited when I found it on DVD and could force my children to watch it with me. I still know all the songs by heart and so when I realized one of my favorites was cut from the episode I was so sad! It's a DVD how is there no room for the entire episode?!?! So that was a bummer but still happy to have it but would have been thrilled if they had left the entire episode as it was.",1476662400,2,604,3.763779527559055
8661319,2,B00KTFJ6RE,"This DVD probably confirms my worst fears, and the master copies of the 1984 and 1985 My Little Pony specials are the edited versions which cut two songs (one song from each special). I'm one of those people who just can not get used to ""Rescue at Midnight Castle"" in it's syndicated format (when I originally saw it, it was just called ""My Little Pony""). Since I saw ""Escape from Catrina"" for the first time, it was in syndication, so the edited version doesn't bug me as much as it does ""Midnight Castle,"" but still, is it too much to ask for someone to find a way to get the unedtited versions of these on DVD?",1465257600,,613,4.293103448275862
