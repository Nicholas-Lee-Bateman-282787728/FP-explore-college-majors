by smearing it.  I could not clean it.  Anna",1420070400,,176,4.088235294117647

8441210,5,B004U6I3OK,"I just got back from a vacation to Kauai in February---The sunrise and sunset shots in the video were a perfect way to remember this vacation.  I like videos with little or no talking, and this one fit the bill.  I liked the music--very soothing.  The shots taken of places I recognize from my vacation were fantastic.  Anyone who has been to Kauai or plans to visit someday will enjoy watching this.",1305072000,4,400,4.513888888888889
8441211,5,B004U6I3OK,"My doctor's clinic plays nature videos in the waiting room to help people relax.  I recommended some of the Serenity Moments videos since I own some of them and they always help me to relax.  They now have a couple of the Serenity Moments videos in the collection which they play often.

I like this video because of the beautiful ocean scenes, the swaying palms, the flowers and the sunset at the end.  The color of the Waimea canyon is also spectacular.  The music is also very enjoyable.",1301788800,5,490,4.5227272727272725
