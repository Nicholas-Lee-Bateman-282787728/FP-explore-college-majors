Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it. The black-and-white cinematography has not aged as color would. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of "" It Came from Uranus! "" is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is that these men are protecting us.

Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that its a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both story and saga.

To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, and gotten away with them.

A true Masterpiece.

This movie has everything for the science fiction fan.  Rockets, Ray guns, Scantily clad Beautiful Women,  Robots, Dinosaurs, and lots of nonstop action. No, it's not Star Trek, but a masterpiece nevertheless.",1425340800,,1248,4.826291079812207
