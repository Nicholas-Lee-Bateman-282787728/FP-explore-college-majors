8311416,3,B001IV8A0C,I bought these for my 4 year old thinking they would be on the lines of Diego where the child can learn some science as they are entertained. These DVDs are very entertaining and they do offer some education on their topics. They are more for entertainment though than learning. I only gave them 3 stars because I expected a little more from Discovery.,1227484800,3,352,4.515625
