2894929,5,B000T63TQC,I am in in my 20s now but when i started this it was a video and i was only 12... the results are amazing! i would say this is more of an intermediate level...it would be a bit difficult to do if you haven't mastered the regular 20 min. its a very well-rounded version of pilates that targets every body part for an hour. im always getting complimented on good posture since i always stand with my shoulders drawn back and my powerhouse stabilized...i can owe all of that to winsor pilates;foremost being this dvd. To be honest i havnt lost much weight but the fact that i stand upright and with confidence makes me look leaner and longer...initially some of the moves in this dvd might seem difficult but don't give up cuz with time youll get it down... i still haven't mastered  a couple of them  ;),1286409600,22,801,4.333333333333333
2894930,5,B000T63TQC,"Mari Winsor's Accelerated Body Sculpting is truly amazing. I had the VHS version for many years, then stopped using it when I upgraded to DVD. I missed it so much that I had to it again.  It does take some time getting used to.  You may feel you are not improving, but keep at it.  It can take several months, but believe me, it is absolutely worth it.  You feel leaner, stronger, more flexible and connected with your body. It gives you a great total body workout.

I never thought I can do the dolphin, but I did.  I alternate pilates with running and bootcamp classes.",1275436800,7,571,4.339622641509434
2894931,5,B000T63TQC,I was so glad to find this DVD as I had lost my original.  I have tried other Mari Winsor workouts which are good but this is still the best.  It works out all the areas and gives the best results.,1238025600,22,197,3.7804878048780486

2894957,2,B000T63TQC,"The actual workout could be done in half the time, she talks way too much so you're just waiting around. I have three small children and not enough time to be waiting around!",1416268800,,174,4.303030303030303
2894958,4,B000T63TQC,"This workout, led by well-known Pilates instructor Mari Winsor, is included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Basic-Workout-Set/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Basic Workout Set</a>.  Winsor instructs a live class of five background exercisers, walking around teaching rather than performing the moves herself.  One of the background exercisers shows modifications.  However, this routine is most appropriate for intermediate level Pilates practitioners or at least fairly experienced beginners.

The workout begins with several warm-up moves such as the Pilates Hundred, the Roll-Up, the Roll-Over, Leg Circles, and Rolling like a Ball.  Winsor then moves the group through the classic Series of 5 (Single Leg Stretch, Double Leg Stretch, Single Stretch Leg Stretch, Leg Lowers, and Criss Cross).  Next comes a brief stretch followed by back work performed on the stomach.  This is followed by the side leg kick series, including Front-Back, Up-Down, Bicycle, and Scissors.  The class then returns to lying on their backs for both full and half Teaser, Can Can, and Hip Circles.  They come to seated for the Spine Twist and then rise onto their knees for Kneeling Side Kicks.  The workout concludes with Mermaid, Twist prep, and Seal.

Overall, this routine is nicely executed, and it provides a decent 52-minute workout.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is simply because it is somewhat bland and boring--it's definitely not my favorite Pilates DVD.  Still, I would recommend it.",1412380800,,1572,5.872246696035242
2894959,5,B000T63TQC,My favorite workout. So much fun it never gets old. Sculpts and shapes like no other.,1409875200,,85,4.375

2894962,1,B000T63TQC,found it to be a bit boring. not enough work out to much talking in it and not enough challenge to it.,1397088000,,102,3.6818181818181817
2894963,5,B000T63TQC,"Strong workout routine with clear directions and demonstrations on how to do each exercise. This is not a video for beginners, but it is easy to jump in and do what you can, and then progress through the cd as you advance in pilates.",1396742400,,233,4.318181818181818
2894964,5,B000T63TQC,"Great workout that challenges you.
Highly recommend.
Great detail on explaining poses. Doesn't require a lot of space to do workout.",1389052800,,132,5.333333333333333
2894965,3,B000T63TQC,I thought the work out would be more strenuous.  I do quite a bit of yoga and am fairly flexible and strong but I thought that Pilates was supposed to be harder.  This is close to an hour workout and I did not break a sweat.  I was not able to do all the exercises due to my experience level but I am not sure doing them all totally correct would change the level of the workout.  I plan to keep using the DVD and hone my skills but I'd have liked to have it be a bit more challenging.,1378771200,,485,3.82
2894966,5,B000T63TQC,"This is a great product that increases flexibility and just makes you feel better about yourself. It isn't so challenging that it is not doable, but it offers a solid core workout.",1378684800,,180,4.65625
2894967,5,B000T63TQC,"I am 52 years old and have been working out to home 'videos' and the gym for years, including Tracy Anderson, NYC ballet, bootcamp, kickboxing(not my fav),The Firm, cardio, everything. This is my current FAVORITE. Has some of the usual 100 series and typical moves but includes fun and challenging moves which I could barely do at first, like the jacknife, but after 3 or 4 sessions I can do it right and 'with control' AND with less strain on lower back. At first I had such little control of the 'rollover' that I smacked my toes on the wall (lol) but am now able to control it. You feel the strengthening and tightening effects almost immediately.  I can't wait to do it again today even though it's a little longer that i would usually 'look forward' to, but it feels so good to do. The program moves along steadily and has nice back stretch exercises between more intense moves. Still am nowhere near able to do the last 'challenge' on video.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this workout and its my fav Mari Windsor. I find that the challenge each time is to try and have more control and to do it as correctly and beneficially as possible. It just feels good especially when you start to master the moves....and is a good stress reliever after a hard day of work.",1378684800,4,1257,4.437229437229437
2894968,5,B000T63TQC,"The workout follows a traditional Pilates routine as I  remembered it from my Fitness class. It's good for intermediate to accelerated enthusiasts. It's fine for a motivated beginner who is willing to move through the progressions. The routine has all my favorites such as the 100s, leg spirals, the saw, the twist and the seal. You work for the entire 45 minute cd!",1372723200,6,366,4.809523809523809

I LOVE this DVD.  My body feels so tight!  I feel like I get a workout and I lengthen my body out and clear out my mind.  No matter my mood or mental state by the end of the 55 mins I am happy and relaxed and worked out!",1332720000,11,395,3.4942528735632186
2894985,5,B000T63TQC,Mari Windsor has great pilates videos. I like this one because you don't need a band or the sculpting circle required for some of her other videos. You can do it anywhere.,1315958400,4,171,4.375

(17-23) Everytime I go back to it I see instant results. I dropped Pilates for a little while and centered by workout at the Gym, didn't really see much going on until I decided to run and do Pilates.
