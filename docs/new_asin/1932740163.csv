I really couldn't make it past the first few minutes because the quality is so poor, grainy, and the sound is terrible. It is hard to understand what they are saying at times. I have started the book and it's already helpful, I'm regretting spending any money on this DVD. Don't buy it, just read the book.",1377302400,,413,4.594594594594595
7801562,3,1932740163,"We read the Babywise book before watching the video.  The video basically is a ""dumb down"" version of the book.  It didn't provide any earth shattering advice.  The video would be good for people who only have an hour (can't read the book) and need the basics.  The couple who produced it are very genuine.  The participants are from Austrailia so it was hard at times to understand them! We bought the 5 S's video before this one and it was much better in providing practical advice for a newborn.",1339632000,,498,4.488888888888889
