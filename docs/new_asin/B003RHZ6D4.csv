8403674,2,B003RHZ6D4,"A boy named Zindy, a chimpanzee and an old guy live in a bayou-like area outside of a large swamp.  There particularly troubling scenarios occur between a 60 year old ""grandfather"" and a 12 year old boy.  What I'm saying is- Just from watching bits and pieces of the movie, lets just say I have a few theories as to why certain scenes were included.  Besides my accusations of the Directors or producers possible ""young boy fetish"" its pretty standard fare for a kids movie.  Its a Mexican film dubbed in English so I get the feeling their is a lot wrong with the dialogue translation and the story.  Then again their is a comic relief chimpanzee throughout the film.  If you're really curious- their is a wonderful ""Riff Trax"" of this film- and its ultimately the best way to watch it.",1406073600,,786,4.5

The other movies were of questionable value. Those were not G rated
but advertised as family movies.",1296777600,,173,4.4375
