6124242,3,B00GYU3YPI,"I thought I was purchasing a Christmas ""episode"" from the fourth season as was the case in an earlier season. This purchase was a Christmas PROMOTION for the Season 2 episodes UK version, which was included in the 3-year box set that I had already purchased!",1397779200,17,258,4.630434782608695
6124243,1,B00GYU3YPI,This would not play on my blue ray disk player. Very disappointed. Wasn't opened for several weeks after receiving it due to being out of town for family medical leave so thought it too late to request a refund.,1394928000,2,211,4.435897435897436
6124244,5,B00GYU3YPI,"The first thing to mention is that this episode is included in the North American Season 4 DVD and also the Seasons 1-4 set.

A large part of the British nation sat down on Christmas night in a state of concerned anticipation. The previous two Downton Christmas Specials have been, well, a bit mixed. The first was probably the best ever episode of Downton, featuring Bates' problems. However, last year the Special spent most of the time without anything very much happening but then managed to cast a pall over the festivities for many with its tragic ending.

This year, however, in my opinion Downton did not disappoint. As the title suggests, it is largely based in London and centres around the `coming out' of Lady Rose in 1923. For those of you who have not come across the expression, this involves the rather quaint upper class custom of introducing eligible young ladies to society, including being introduced to royalty. There is a good measure of romance, jealousy and intrigue - in other words exactly what we would expect from Downton! The pace of the plot is reasonable although arguably there was a little too much in the way of social gathering dominating the action, particularly earlier on. However, for me the highlight was the anticipated rematch between the incomparable Maggie Smith and Shirley MacLaine, fully charged with caustic wit and the clash of two strong personalities. Well worth seeing just for that little gem!

Certainly it was not as good as the first ever Downton Christmas Special, but that is hardly a fair comparison as that was such a good episode, with a strong central story. This was more a continuation of various existing plot lines, but was a good, solid Downton offering which most viewers will have enjoyed.",1394928000,7,1758,4.8533333333333335
6124245,5,B00GYU3YPI,Excelent perfomances and story.  The characters are fully developed. It's a soap opera but done on a grand scale. Watch and get hooked.,1393027200,,135,4.869565217391305
6124246,5,B00GYU3YPI,"The first thing to be said about this series is that it is British from the very first scene to the very last by the vast range of actors and actresses as for age and the extreme quality of these actors, most of them having parallel careers in theaters, television and the cinema. They are thus able to act with a vast variety of stances and tones and at the same time with a great expressivity on their faces or with their body language. Within that great versatility and mental or dramatic agility there is not one single age that is privileged and the older generation is just as good and as present as the youngest one and the age range, apart from the few children, goes from the late teens and early twenties to the seventies. This is exceptional and no American series will ever be able to do that. A TV actor might turn up in the cinema but then he will never go back to TV, and both will hardly be able to work on a stage. The case of ""Harry Potter,"" or Daniel Radcliffe if you prefer, is typically British who can play on the stage or act in a film. That mobility is not American, and American television sure misses something there, just as much as it misses the use of older actors and actresses, as well as very young ones, leveling the cast within a twenty to thirty years age bracket.

The second element that makes this series beautifully and exceptionally British is the fact it is situated before, during and after the First World War in England and everything is there to tell you, you are in England. The Mansion in which the action takes place, the official Downton Abbey, which is of course not the real name, the village next to it, the array of vehicles and cars, the steam engine and the train, even the London of that time, all is reconstructed the way it was or used to be. Only England can have that Tudor architecture. It is in no way similar to anything anywhere else in the world and if there is something looking like it in the USA, it is nothing but a copy, hence a fake, or maybe, like the old London Bridge, a rejected ruin that was bought over here and brought and rebuilt over there, in a piece of desert even.

The third element is the society it depicts. There is the upstairs of the aristocrats, lords, ladies, duchesses, earls and so on that is so English in its vanity, social exclusiveness, social segregation, social racism even. And there is the downstairs of the servants, the copy cat hierarchy of the service from the butler at the top to the housekeeper at the top too, then to the valets and the footmen on one side, and to the maids and kitchen hands on the other side, and with some hierarchy within each echelon of this social descending ladder. To be in the service was a great honor and privilege and one could spend one's whole life in it and climbing the rungs of that ladder one at a time over the decades. But this series is exceptional because it goes far beyond that simple capture of social stratification.

The main lady, the wife of the Earl has an American mother, and brother (not very much present in the series), and this American line is always the source of some humor more than anything else, though of course it is also the source of a lot of money and opportunities.

The chauffeur of the estate is Irish, a republican socialist what's more, and he falls in love with one of the three daughters and she would have eloped if her father had not accepted to change his mind. This daughter will die in childbirth and the Irish socialist ex-chauffeur who is thus the father of a little girl who is a blood relative of the family is accepted in this circle but as the one who is going to take over the management of the estate, hence a full time job, and yet he does not feel at home really. But he finds a real position because of what he is doing: saving the English aristocracy from being bankrupt and run over by the capitalists, by becoming capitalists themselves, with the help of a new generation of non-aristocrats who break all kinds of rules just because they can since they are not aristocrats.

The heir of the estate is a non aristocrat (he inherits the estate but not the title) but his fate is tragic though he provides the family with a very much desired male heir. His wife, the oldest daughter, is a very strange character though she might be able to change and evolve with the world, especially after the war because England has to change fast if they want to avoid some social upheaval.

The general picture here is fascinating.

In the same way what is happening downstairs is fascinating with love and hatred, with spying and plotting, of all sorts, even a rape here and there to pepper and salt the scene, a few violent crimes too, well disguised if possible. Not to speak of a possible divorce that is not brought to its fulfillment because the woman dies in the mean time. Bleak and dark, and yet some women in that set of servants are outstandingly honest and humane. This world is a world of its own and that too is interesting.

All together this series is a lot more fascinating than I have said because of these numerous and varied levels of social norms and taboos that are broken or challenged by a set of extremely good actors and actresses that make the show a real gem of television production. Note the way the Prince of Wales who was to become a king who married a divorcee and was obliged to abdicate because of it is ridiculed, is absolutely funny, though that more or less covers his bad political reputation since he was on Hitler's side, more or less, and to show him as having the most careless and freewheeling morality you can imagine for a future king justifies the fact that he was nicely pushed aside. It could not be done with more humor, though very cruel humor for that prince who has to acknowledge what could have been a scandal and his obligation to owe one to a set of aristocrats who used the skills of their servants to salvage a situation that was desperate. The London season is really funny then.

6124247,1,B00GYU3YPI,"Why did Mr. Fellowes bother us with this? And by ""this"" I mean season 4! What a jumbled silly bunch of tripe!!!!! I am surprised that someone of the caliber actor that is Maggie Smith would allow her name and reputation to be associated with such boring garbage!!
Pleaw tell me why Amazon is attaching so many ""5 star"" ratings on this comment area? How dare they minimize the majority of the comments to be shoved so far down the list as to create the appearance of favorable reviews???
Shame on you Amazon!!!

6124249,2,B00GYU3YPI,"Since I just received Season 4 on Blu-ray, I noticed to my chagrin that this disc is also included in Season 4. So here's my take on this, and I may be wrong. The copy of The London Season has a ""B"" region code, meaning for Europe. I suspect this show hadn't been done yet when Season 4 concluded in Europe. PBS was able to catch it in time later on when doing the series 4 for the US and included it then. My take is that buyer beware when buying this disc, as it is already included in season 4. It is a great disc, just not one that's needed if you're getting the season 4.",1390608000,74,576,3.9316239316239314
6124250,2,B00GYU3YPI,"The prime question for me has to be ""Why am I, ...and Fellowes, still doing this?""
Apart from the time I have invested in watching this show drag on, (and the admittedly somewhat vicarious but dwindling interest in writing these reviews), it must be said that D.A. ran out of originality and things to say LONG ago.

From the now familiar close-up of the white labrador's bum that opens the show, to that ""ding-ding-ding-ding"" nonsensical theme that insinuates itself into your brain, it has now lapsed completely into actors fully dosed up on Valium, laced into expensive costumes, moving languidly in front of beautiful sets and given nothing more exciting to do than mouth some of the most trite and unconvincing dialogue you are ever likely to hear.
Do wait for Lady Edith's delivery of the classic ""Sometimes I think we should make more of a fuss....!""
Fellowes has REAL trouble writing convincing dialogue, and so often in this special in particular, the ""clunkiness"" just grates on your ears.

It is as if Fellowes is absolutely determined this time to avoid any upset of the devoted viewer. Can he have been motivated by all those extravagant outpourings of indignant outrage issuing largely from America over his having had the temerity to kill off Matthew in Season Three? (It's still raging here on Amazon!)

This is strictly T.V. by numbers, folks.
The sum however is SO much less than the total of all its parts.
It SHOULD have been so good. It's given everything to work with.
Well of course mention must be made of the most appallingly incompetent use of ""green-screen"" fake backgrounding to the scenes where the family supposedly have a picnic at the Albert Memorial!
However, on the whole there are some reasonably capable actors, luxurious costuming, great locations and sets, and superb period detailing, but when it comes to script and dialogue, ...it really fails to ignite.

Now to the story.
Bates does not appear until well into the piece, and his given screen times are brief, but he does get to perform the single action that ""saves-the-day"" for Downton, thereby erasing any lingering suspicions held by Lady Rigor-Mortis about whether he did or did not push the rapist of his wife under the bus.
(Evidence appears to show he WAS in London at the time, despite his denial.)

Just why three men are competing for the aforementioned Lady's affections at all continues to baffle me. What affections? She's about as cold and devoid of emotion as Eskimo Nell's...toes?

Countess Cora continues to just drift aimlessly around the set, still tilting her head and playing what has to be THE most unaware Mother of all time.
Not only does she act as if completely doped to the gills, but she fails to even realise her second daughter has given birth to a grandchild!
Now THAT'S one astute mother!

The young piece of Scottish fluff otherwise identified as Lady Rose MacClare continues to be the most irritating young ""flapper"". She totally over-plays every scene with enough gung-ho enthusiasm as to demand the immediate application of a straight-jacket.
Is she the only character that avoided the Valium in the catering tent, and went for the amphetamines instead?
She's so ""gosh-golly gee whiz boop-boop-a-doo"" that you just want to throttle her, .....or send her back to the amateur cast of ""Anything Goes"".

I was at least hoping Thomas would be given more to do to justify his still being in the cast, but despite a few intimations of malicious scheming, absolutely nothing eventuates at all.
Fellowes is leaving his run VERY late if anything is to ever emerge from Thomas as far as any nefarious machinations go.

Then there is a most idiotic episode concerning Tom Branson, ...who after treating the local school teacher to dinner at the pub, concedes to her request to ""see the House"".
The tour goes well until she asks to see ""upstairs"", and as soon as they have ascended, they are ""sprung"" by a lurking Thomas.
Branson immediately goes into an inexplicable fumble of excuses to his employee.
Of course they have done nothing, .....but what business is it of a servant anyway?

What is incomprehensible is that viewers will remember that Branson was quite ready to indulge in clandestine full-on sexual relations with a lowly ladies maid that snuck into his bedroom with her social-climbing designs, ....but he's suddenly all a'fluster when a socially inferior servant sees him with a women from an almost respectable profession merely at the first landing of the stairs?
Servants were expected to be both blind and deaf, ...and were summarily dismissed for any breaches of this policy, ....and WITHOUT a reference!
(This was the ultimate punishment, as no one would employ anyone to service without a prior reference.)

Shirley MacLaine's character is reprised, but this time in a somewhat more sympathetic version, but again it's just ""walk-on"" acting for Ms. MacLaine.
She does manage to score a few points with her last particularly observant thrust at Maggie Smith though.

What must surely be some shocking miscasting is evident in the later throes of this episode.
A Prince of Wales that can't dance? The actor's bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the actual historical person is forgivable but they could have at least got someone who could dance!
The PoW was known for his social graces! Watch this klutz try to waltz!

However in what has to be the most ridiculous piece of melodrama yet, there is a totally ludicrous episode about the retrieval of an incriminating note written by the PoW. (Just the one?)
It's now in the hands of that disreputable card-shark exposed in Series Four! (Don't even ask why any of the D.A. personages are still even associating with him, let alone entertaining him.)

The entire cast is asked to take part in a clandestine plot involving incredibly convoluted plans, forged letters, searching of rooms, and manipulations of people. The whole thing would be far more suitable to some amateur theatrical ""Who-dunnit"" than a show with the pretensions of D.A.
Needless to say it all comes to nothing, and the aforementioned Bates is left to demonstrate a few ....er, ...specific ""skills"" in order to save the day. One can only imagine he must have picked up these talents while away languishing at Her Majesty's Pleasure?

All of the above aside, D.A. has now become SO formulaic as to hold no mystery whatsoever if you are hoping for further plot developments.
No surprises,...no ""cliff-hangers"", not even any more surprise deaths.
And many of the cast must by now be seeking an ""out"".

Lady Edith's intended husband and father of her child is apparently held by the Nazi Brown Shirts (S.A.), and the possibility of his return is thus left open, but that's about it really.
Even this ""development"" is thrown in virtually as an after-thought at the end of this ""special"".

Yes, everybody who has made it thus far will watch this, ...and the glowing adulations will no doubt pour in from our less discriminating brethren across the Atlantic, but this is really the last dying gasp of what started out as a great Series.

Down to Two Stars from me now. Seems I have finally learned to separate exquisite form from banal substance.

Surely there won't be a Series Five?",1390262400,6,7231,4.897792313982012
6124251,4,B00GYU3YPI,"By this point, ""Downton Abbey"" knows what its audience wants and delivers: high production values, pretty costumes, minor intrigues and rich aristocrats making the lives of their servants difficult. Set in 1923, the 2013 Christmas Special has the Crawley family head for London in order to attend Rose's first season. Wending through various balls, picnics and presentations are at least half-a-dozen subplots, though most of the attention remains on the Crawleys' attempt to prevent a minor scandal involving the Prince of Wales and his mistress Freda Dudley Ward. Rose blames herself when a love-letter from the prince to Freda goes missing, and realizing who the culprit is, Lord Grantham organises his niece and daughters in an elaborate attempt to steal it back.

Notable guest stars include Shirley MacClaine as Lady Grantham's mother Martha Levensin and Paul Giamatti as her son (Cora's brother) Harold Levensin, both arriving in London to enjoy the season after the latter's disastrous business investment. In Martha's words: ""We came three and a half thousand miles so we could change the subject."" Almost immediately, Rose's friend Madeline is pushed into the wealthy bachelor's path by her father Lord Aysgarth (James Fox), who has his own designs on Martha's fortune.

Having killed off two major characters in seasons three and four (due to the actors deciding to move on to other projects), writer/creator Julian Fellowes seems determined to play things safe from here on out. Everything is light and fluffy, in which the stakes are no greater than what suitor Mary should pick (though honestly I don't know how she tells them apart), whether Daisy should pursue a job in America, and what Rose should wear to her debutant ball. Even the attack upon Anna - the controversial talking point of season four - has been more or less swept under the rug.

That leaves a myriad of little plots, though by this point the extensive cast (plus the guest stars) mean that some characters are stretched rather thin. In one of weightier plots, Edith is struggling over giving up her baby (having given birth to an illegitimate child in the time-skip between this special and the finale of season four) and trying to find a way to keep the baby girl in her life. Elsewhere, Thomas (described in at least one comedy sketch as ""the evil footman"") is trying to accumulate information on the family that could prove useful in his schemes, whilst Branson gets himself into an awkward situation with the village school teacher.

As always, Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess is on hand to make disparaging comments at everyone else's expense, but her newfound friendship with Isabel remains one of the more heart-warming aspects of the show. Carson continues to act appalled at the merest whiff of modernity, Mrs Hughes tries to organise a trip for the servants to the sea-side, and scullery-maid Daisy gets the chance at an American flirtation. Cora beams at everyone and remains oblivious to practically everything around her (including the fact that her middle child has just given birth to her second grand-daughter), whilst Lord Grantham blusters and makes loud speeches to his increasingly diffident family.

I can't help but feel as though maybe Fellowes is getting a little tired of his original characters, choosing to focus more on the guest stars, so your enjoyment of this particular Christmas Special may depend on whether you appreciate the likes of Harold, Madeline, Freda, Rose and Martha, or whether you would have preferred the focus to remain more strongly on the Crawley family.

But as ever, it all looks beautiful, whether it be the costumes, the sets, or the locations. I know for a lot of people the show has lost its lustre in recent years, but as a casual viewer, I tune in for the high production values and the glimpse into a different time-period that the show affords me. By this point the stakes are ridiculously low (find an incriminating letter! Choose between two bland love interests! Bow to the king and queen without tripping!), but it's a pleasant enough diversion that seems intent on being as cheery and light as possible after the tragic deaths of past seasons.",1388880000,27,4198,4.99
