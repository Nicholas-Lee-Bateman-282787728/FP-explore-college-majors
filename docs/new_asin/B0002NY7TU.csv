8029772,5,B0002NY7TU,"There's a lot of good stuff in this - but of course the main thing is to say farewell to the ""old"" Fuji layout before its redesign/modernization (read: Tilke updates for F1 which sort of retain the character but made the circuit much wider and added more runoff, and some slightly bizarre corner angles that result from drafting a circuit on a computer perhaps?).  I really miss the old Fuji actually, even though the new one is still nice.  There is the usual battle with a grid of supercars/JDM sports cars, plus the Hakosuka GT-R also appears with a great drive from Gan-San.  We also hear from drivers who raced at Fuji in Formula Nippon or Group C (Nissan R89C and R92CP) and lapped some of the fastest times ever in its current layout.

The other segments are also fun to watch, I loved the JGTC (SuperGT) so that is always a pleasure to see, and the Touge stuff is also cool if you're into drifting plus grip driving on crazy mountain roads.

I really liked the inclusion of the bonus footage with Nakaya at Tokyo Auto Show 2003 - didn't find it boring but some might not dig his relaxed (almost soothing) style, he's not trying to hype anything or only show cars with a lot of bling.  I particularly liked when he got into a Porsche Carrera GT.  But basically it was nice to see the spontaneous footage as he checked out the various manufacturers and I liked the camera work.  I find myself wishing there were more episodes of Nakaya reporting for BMI at more recent Tokyo Auto Shows.",1346198400,2,1492,4.459558823529412
8029773,5,B0002NY7TU,"The remembrance of the Fuji Speedway was absolutely fantastic. I found the commentating to be rather boring at the Tokyo Auto Saloon. But it's great to see video of older car shows and realize how far we have come since then. The JGTC part of the video is really cool, it's unfortunate that Keiichi Tsuchiya never placed very high. Overall, one of the best BMI's.

The PERFECT GIFT for that special motorsports fan in your life!

Best Motoring International (BMI) is a great series and, as an automotive enthusiast, I've never seen an episode I didn't love (and I've seen almost all of them)! But Fuji Fast stands out as one of the best episodes so far.

In this episode, the BMI drivers say farewell to Fuji Speedway as it closes down for 2 years for renovation and remodeling. They share their fond memories and thoughts on one of Japan's most famous race tracks, including reminiscing from some of the track's record holders. Fuji Speedway's rich history is explored fully with several vintage clips of it's greatest moments over the last few decades. Racing nuts will truly love it! And, of course, the BMI gang says a final ""farewell"" to Fuji in their own special way: with an INTENSE 4 lap battle! The drivers learn first hand why Fuji is called ""Japan's fastest track!"" You can't go wrong with a race between a group of sports cars totalling nearly $500,000.00 in the hand's of drivers who don't care about wrecking them!

Then, it's off to the touge (pronounced toe-gay) for some racing and drifting INITIAL-D STYLE in the mountains of Japan with some very fast, tuned Nissan Silvias (240SX), a high-boost, tuned FD Mazda RX-7 and a powerful, highly tuned, exotic NSX!

Finally, another installment of the truly inspirational saga of ""Drift King"" Tsuchiya's battle in the JGTC racing series (Japan's NASCAR). Team ARTA suffers a difficult loss and must pick up the pieces and try again at the next race as they struggle with car problems (as is often the case in racing).

Ferrari 360 Modena, Ferrari F355, Porsche 911 GT3, Mitsu EVO 8 RS, Honda NSX Type R, Subaru WRX STi Spec C, Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R
