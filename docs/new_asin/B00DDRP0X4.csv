5792911,1,B00DDRP0X4,"I really wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this box set! This is by far one of my favorite shows, however the discs will NOT play in my blu-Ray player, my ps4, or my xbox360.  And, because I didn't begin watching it until today, my one month return window has closed so I am stuck with these discs that I cannot even watch.

I am extremely disappointed with Amazon and the seller with this transaction.",1442102400,,421,4.384615384615385

5792918,4,B00DDRP0X4,"One of the most genuinely funny comedy series I've ever seen, really nice to have a comedic series on TV that doesn't rely exclusively on a constant stream of stale one-liners.  Definitely will be getting the later seasons as well.

The packaging is a little on the weak side in all honesty, its a very cheap thin plastic box and the disc are all in a 'holder' that sits inside it and can be removed; the holder is made of the same plastic.  I like that I can take them out all at once but I really do not like how cheap the plastic of the case is.  Little bits chip off pretty easily.",1435276800,,585,4.105263157894737

5792927,5,B00DDRP0X4,"This is the best show ever. Unlike other TV shows, you have to keep up with them to understand. Not this one. Each episode could be watched and be great. Also, they do not get old. I watch the first season several time with my husband and we still laughed ourselves to tears each time (and woke up the kids laughing a few times too).

5792930,2,B00DDRP0X4,"I love this show so much. But I bought the blu-ray, not aware this show isn't widely available in blu-ray. The blu-ray is a different format than I'm used to, which is perfectly fine- just a heads up. The Blu-ray Discs worked for the first few episodes, but my discs started glitching a lot with very pixilated pictures. Save your money and buy the regular DVDs. Very disappointed with my purchase.",1420156800,,398,4.619718309859155
5792931,2,B00DDRP0X4,"BUYER BEWARE!!!  Nothing listed on the product page said that this Blu-Ray set could be in a format OTHER THAN MY REGION.  When I received it, I noticed that the labeling on the discs indicated it was made for IRELAND; not USA!!?!?  In the fine print on the seller's info page, ""All Regions"" assures that the main feature will play on all machines, BUT NOT THE SPECIAL FEATURES.  Why on earth would anyone purchase BluRay discs if they don't care to watch the special features??  That's the ONLY reason I purchased this set on BluRay.  Had I known that there was a good chance the special features would not play or would 'skip' or something, I would have just purchased each season on Amazon Instant Video.  I'm returning the set unopened and won't purchase another set until I can find a bonafide Region A/1 set.  I'm probably just going to go ahead and buy each season on Amazon Instant Video instead of purchasing discs because of this experience.  I'm very disappointed.  Thankfully, however, I can return this set for free without a ton of hassle via Amazon's excellent return policy.  And thankfully, the seller didn't make me jump through any hoops to return it, as has happened to me before with third-party sellers on Amazon.  But I didn't take a chance on cracking the seal because I didn't want to risk not being able to return it.  Stopped cold when I noticed the discs were labeled for play in Ireland.",1419897600,2,1416,4.616

5792933,3,B00DDRP0X4,"Amazon is combining the reviews for the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of this box set.

I can confirm that the BLU-RAY set plays fine in my US Sony Blu-Ray player. The Disks however are labeled as Region A and B, so make sure you aren't in region C (you'll probably already know if you are).

U.S. is region A

The packaging is horrible however, one giant ugly plastic case with a plastic ""book"" inside that holds the discs. The plastic disc holder isn't even connected to the case, it is just free floating. I have another Blu-Ray box set (Big Bang Theory) that comes in a nice cardboard box with multiple regular Blu-ray cases.

I found myself laughing out loud several times while watching.  This is a very funny show.  It starts with excellent writing and a strong ensemble cast.  I bought the first four seasons to start from the beginning and work my way up to the present.  I found myself playing an entire season in one sitting; that's how funny the show is.

5792955,5,B00DDRP0X4,"This show will definitely be one of the greats in the history of television shows. With Seinfeld, All In The Family, Everybody Loves Raymond, etc. Unlike Seinfeld,  which didn't reach its greatness until season three, Modern Family was fully formed from the first episode. You can tell the seasons apart with shows like Seinfeld and All in the Family that improved with each new season and became the legends they are today. Modern Family is that rare show that had all the pieces right at the start. You can mix up the seasons and it would be hard to tell them apart. The pilot up to the last show of the fourth season. I didn't watch the show until it came to syndication but I fell in love with it soon after and just couldn't get enough that I had to purchase this set. If you are a fan then get this set. The Blu - ray presentation just can't be beat. The extras are everything that you expect and more. I even love the menu screen with that great theme music.

5792960,2,B00DDRP0X4,I love the show but the Blu-ray set up is horrible. It's like a person who designed the Blu-ray has never watch a DVD or Blu-ray before. Blu-ray takes forever to load up. No other Blu-ray disc I own takes this long. When you play season mode and decide not to put in the next disc it's almost impossible to get back to the main menu it has to reload from the beginning and takes up to three minutes before you get back to the menu.

Unfortunately, many of the dvd's would only play the first few episodes and then refuse to go any further and one  disc (I think in seaon 2) would not play at all.  Luckily I realized this during the return period and was able to send the package back.

5792967,5,B00DDRP0X4,"If you have not seen the series, but have heard how great it is, believe it.  It is one of the funniest shows on television.  The easy comparisons to make are to The Office and Arrested Development.  If you like either or both of those shows then you will like this one as well.  But I would say it is a blend of those, and then if you took Married With Children and combined it with the shows it was making fun of like The Cosby Show, Family ties etc, then you would have this.  It has a message of family love and togetherness that the more sappy 1980s sitcoms had, with a little bit of the dysfunction of Arrested Development or Married With Children sprinkled in.  But part of the reason it is so funny is because you can buy it as being a ""real"" family dealing with real situations.  In fact a lot of the moments that are put into the show are based on the writers' real experiences.

The series tells the story of a family headed by Jay Pritchett (played wonderfully by Ed O'Neil), his daughter and her family, his gay son and his partner and their adopted daughter, and his ""trophy wife"" and step son.  Sometimes the entire family is interacting with each other, and sometimes it is the individual families.  They are interviewed documentary style (for a reason that is not really explained) and those are cut into whatever story is playing out.  The comedy is not as off color as it could get in Arrested Development, but there are times when you definitely are surprised at what they get away with.  It does have a similar flow where the jokes could combine what someone is saying, someone else reacting and combining that with something visual in the background.

O'Neil is definitely the most well known cast member.  It is hard to hear him without thinking of Al Bundy, but the character is very different.  More like a crusty old grandpa.  Julie Bowen and Ty Burell have great chemistry and play off each other so well.  I honestly think their interactions make the show work as well as it does.  Even though the show is the definition of an ensemble cast it gives all the characters great stories to work with, even though there are times when an episode is devoted to one or two characters over the others.

As far as this set.  Unlike some season packs where you just get the individual season sets packaged separately, this has all 12 discs in one flip case.  Kind of like how the individual season sets would be packaged just in one large case,.  This discs play fine as long as you update the firmware on your player.  Unlike what the one star reviewers seemed to think, they are coded to play in the US, but if you have not updated the firmware on your player (presuming you have one that can be updated) they may not play.

Each season has deleted scenes and family interviews on each disc.  The third disc of each season set has all the behind the scenes and making of features, and there are commentary tracks on select episodes.  In all I would say the extras for each season amounts to around 45 min of material give or take.  Definitely enough to make those who like going through that stuff happy.  I came late to this show, and am glad I listened to the people who said how great it was.  If you like slightly off beat sitcoms this is definitely worth checking out.",1396656000,3,3293,4.405629139072848

No wonder this show has won so many awards. Yes, sometimes Sofia can work your nerves thru the television with her loud talking and heavy accent, but I'm still so happy she's on the show because she adds to the funniness and for all of the actors it seems as if it all comes together. They aren't characters still trying to find a way to fit into their character, they make it work flawlessly! No wonder Sofia gets $170,000 per episode!",1393977600,,758,4.093959731543624
