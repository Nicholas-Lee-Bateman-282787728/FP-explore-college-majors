6077377,5,B00GHYIQ18,"A movie that chronicles the passion of people who ""have the bug"" for riding motorcycles. The people interviewed exude the sort of passion that only people who have toiled at successful start-ups have experienced. This movie makes it clear that success and doing something well as as much to do with passion and desire as it does skill....the two things work together and build on each other.

I have the bug.....I love to ride. But even my wife who isn't a rider and isn't at all drawn to the experience and exposure to the elements found the movie very entertaining. She felt the enthusiasm and excitement that drive the various riders shown to be able to perform to the level they did. The cool thing was that many of them seemed like pretty regular people, as regular and you and me.....but they had a passion ignited by their connection to their experiences on a their motorcycle.

The movie was quite broad in it's treatment of the various kinds of motorcyclist....from dirt to street to track. From long distance riding to drag racers, to motorcycle rally goers. Yes, there were probably some areas left uncovered, but not for the lack of general coverage....it was clearly not focused on a single, or even just a couple of kinds of motorcycle enthusiast activities.",1386547200,27,1272,4.777272727272727
6077378,5,B00GHYIQ18,awesome film. like others have said if you ride or are thinking of riding. go see this movie. deffinitely a tearjerker.,1386547200,2,119,4.714285714285714
6077379,5,B00GHYIQ18,"Saw this film here in Arlington Texas on Sunday, December 8. I couldn't have walked away more moved by this AMAZING film than I did. Thank you for the hard work that was put into this documentary. And thank you for not allowing sponsorship during the making. It kept it real and pure.",1386460800,,284,4.377358490566038
6077380,3,B00GHYIQ18,"Way too much screen time of people talking about ""Why We Ride"" than shots of people actually riding. Photography and music were outstanding.  I was hoping for ""On Any Sunday 2013"" and didn't get it.",1386460800,2,198,4.6571428571428575
6077381,4,B00GHYIQ18,"I saw it last night at Franklin Mills Mall in north Philly. The theater was packed and there were a lot of familiar faces. The cinematography was excellent - breathtaking shots! The message was great, but in my honest opinion it got a bit preachy for me. It included many facets of the motorcycle culture including how motorcycling started and the culture developed over the years. There were parts on street biking, dirt biking, short tracks, road racing, motocross, motoGP and cruisers. I felt there was a large focus on motorcycle riding with the family. Also, there was really nothing about Baja, Rallye racing like Dakar, and very little on dual sporting. I have a feeling that there were trying to go a different route than On Any Sunday and Dust to Glory (two of my favorite movies).

Go see it - or buy the DVD and share it with friends.",1386201600,23,845,4.596026490066225

6077391,5,B00GHYIQ18,"I loved this video. I was in tears at the end, it speaks to the heart of the biker, seasoned or new.  I'm a new rider, sport bike specifically, but been 2-up for many years.  This included so many of the well-known names, and the folks next door, that fill our world on and off the road.  And it's a world for all of us.

And, as much as I loved the video, I felt it missed a couple points, or could have explored them more....particularly more on all types of women and bikes.  A lot of us ride for the ride, not all of us are making records for the books, but more for ourselves.  I made my own record becoming a rider at 60 years old.  And to add, 2-up shouldn't be neglected as an aspect of motorcycling, there is an intimacy that is shared between the partners that cannot be denied.  Boyfriend/girlfriend, or husband/wife, it's the ride and a time that can't be shared by anyone else, it's exclusive.  It is your own world at that moment, at that location, on that road, in that conversation.  I will never forego that aspect of motorcycle riding.

That being said, it was a contemporary and beautiful video, really, very well done, giving a fantastic history on the development of the motorcycle and the variety of ways we enjoy our bikes.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire video, and definitely recommend it to young and old.  And I have to watch it again..... and again.....",1505088000,3,1382,4.393700787401575

6077416,5,B00GHYIQ18,"After putting the bike up for the winter the wife and I rented this film on Amazon after waiting for Netflix to offer it. What a great film - as a rider for 30 plus years there's something in this film for every type of rider - racer, long distance, squids. Unlike other sports, motorcycling attracts a certain type of individual who's looking for more out of life than work-eat-sleep-retire. This film captures that spirit perfectly.",1482019200,,434,4.723684210526316

I can definitely say that I really do have connection to several item pointed out on there from my first motorcycle to teaching my small kids to ride dirt bikes to now riding on long touring trips with my wife.

The movie felt very lukewarm, there were some good aspects of the movie but much of it was very boring.  To me, this would not hold the attention of someone who doesn't already have a love of motorcycles.

Definitely not an awful movie by any stretch, but I wouldn't come into this expecting a movie version that captures the same passion of mini series' like ""Long Way Round"" and ""Long Way Down"".",1471219200,,549,4.581632653061225
6077435,5,B00GHYIQ18,Really nicely done documentary.  Shows really all aspects of motorcycling include some history of how clubs got their start with advent of the motorized bicycle.

By halfway through I was missing the excitement and wonder of On Any Sunday, and kept waiting for great films of top riders doing their thing in the many aspects of our sport.  But the film droned on in the same way to the end.

It touches the core of riding and reminds us motorcyclist as to why we ride. If you are true biker, no matter what you ride, then this movie is a must for your collection. The relationship and the anthropomorphic attributes riders give their bikes and the lifestyle with friendships and discovery along their journey's, makes this hard not to watch and difficult not be swept up into the culture that we call motorcycling.

6077479,4,B00GHYIQ18,"Anyone who watches this should recognize it as a sleek propaganda movie: The sound track is stirring, the photography emotional, and every bias of the public against motorcycles is dutifully addressed: ""We are friendly, and you can pet us!"", ""Look at the two-year olds on their mini and dirt bikes, of course it's safe, and it promotes family coherence!"", ""Awww, MCs don't just engage in gun running and prostitution, they also donate to charity!""

I have a motorcycle, my wife got her license shortly after riding  with me, so I did sip the cool aid already. That's why I gave it so many stars. I can't give it five stars, because if you go to YouTube and look at some of the Triumph commercials, say [...] they'll give you a similar feel, just brand-specific. This was not a documentary by any means.

Watch it, though! It's awesome!",1454803200,,835,4.666666666666667

A lot of brief sound bites from top notch industry experts such as Mert Lawill, Arlen Ness, Troy Lee but if you are not already familiar with these people you get no reference as to why their opinion matters.  One exception is describing Mert's prosthetic hand development.  The section on moto history was interesting but extremely brief.  Hill climbing segment was compelling but in general I don't think this movie ever gets below skin deep.  I give it 3 stars because it is about motorcycling.",1434499200,,564,4.714285714285714

Even someone who has zero interest in mastering two wheels might appreciate this thoughtful insight into a world of machines that we motorcyclists know each contain a unique heart and soul.",1431302400,,607,5.468085106382978
6077546,1,B00GHYIQ18,"The documentary, while good overall, was mainly focused on sport and dirt biking.  There was some focus on other bikes, but very little on the Harley community.  How can a movie on the love of bikes exclude the biggest, arguably most dedicated, cultured group of bikers.  In fact, at one point they referenced the public image of bikers (Honda riders) as being tainted from the Harley-type riders.  This is not a movie for Harley riders.  Absolutely no mention of Sturgis and plenty of talk about dirt bike gatherings and the like.  To avoid Harley riders would be the equivalent of discussing the Civil War and not mentioning this Confederate Army.  Very disappointing!!!!",1430956800,,673,4.955357142857143

6077585,4,B00GHYIQ18,"This is a really wonderful movie. It sort of touches on the culture of motorcycles, the emotion of riding and the comradery. The movie introduces us to ordinary people and racers, interesting locations and events. What the move does not do is provide a diversified story.  Racing, racing, racing, racing and oh, there is stuff about racing. It doesn't dip too much into the type of bikes riders are on or stories of the road.  And that's what the movie is missing, the road stories, the destinations they bring us too and the rides that got us there.

I understand there is a second movie in the making or they are planning it.  Hopefully they pull back from the racing and focus on the ride more than how fast they can go.",1424390400,,723,4.454545454545454

However the movie goes deep about what it is that motivates people to ride and also about what it means to be a good person.  It covers a huge variety of different aspects of riding and most people will learn something about motorcycling but most of all it does do what its title suggests...it tells the ""why"" of riding for a great variety of riders.  I've watched this movie a score of times in just a couple of months.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy an excellent documentary feels more like love story.",1424131200,,682,4.263565891472868

I started with just getting it started and after a few carburetor  adjustment  it spit and sputters , but then suddenly that 800cc Japaneses engine started to roars. I took it for a ride around the block and I will never forget the feeling  that I got. I felt a new sensation that I had never experienced before. This video tells a lot about different peoples experience in riding a bike and I can say that I agree with many of them. As one of the commentators said.

As a very middle-aged woman who has recently discovered she loves motorcycling, more than ""On Any Sunday"" this one made me feel part of the group.  Don't get me wrong -  I own a copy of ""On Any Sunday"" and find motocross fun to watch (with a touch of envy).  But for bringing newer or non-riders into the fold - ""Why We Ride"" explains the lure, while providing some motorcycle history and featuring interviews with some very famous and important people in the business (though names not displayed...making them seem more ""accessible"" and ""normal.""  As a non-racing rider, there are some quotes that resonate, for example: ""Some people do yoga, some knit...I get on a motorcycle and it puts my mind at ease.""

However, there is an over emphasis upon racing, brief mentioning of adventure, which was nice.  The excessive amount of time spent on racing was over the top and completely misses the average guy who rides the roads.  There is no mentioning of long distant touring either.  If the creators would have simply reduce 10 minutes focused on racing and added it to those who are normal riders this would have been spectacular.

I grew up riding bikes with him and I ended up tearing up at points with him because I could relate to so many people. The only thing I wish they did in this movie was label the speakers as they speak instead of only at the end. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars but that is a ticky-tacky thing.

6077658,4,B00GHYIQ18,"Another review from me that was born out of a northern China smog spell! We are a small but highly diverse motorcycle club (if you are ever in Dalian/Liaoning, come ride with the ""Xue Lang, Snow Wolves""!) and a nasty smog/rain mix kept us inside on a Sunday  so we made ourselves comfortable on top of the motorbikes at a friend's repair shop and watched ""Why we ride"". We truly enjoyed the film, even if from our perspective, naturally, it was USA-centric. But it was very interesting for my Chinese buddies to learn about the history of motorcycles in the US and the highly developed contemporary motorbike culture there (China is just revving up in that regard but we're working on it ;-))...and the emotions to which ""Why we ride"" appeals are universal anyway. The film does not at all claim to be comprehensive, it rather explores in personal portraits the experience of connection between wo/man and machine and the camaraderie among motorcycle humans who just 'have it in their blood'. The visuals and sounds gave me goosebumps and surely compensated for not being able to be out on the road ourselves! So definitely get this for a rainy day.",1413763200,,1149,4.745

6077764,4,B00GHYIQ18,"I really enjoyed this movie. For the short-clip interview style it felt rather long by the end of the whole movie. It would've been nice to stay a little longer with some topics but they had a lot to cram in so it's understandable. I would've liked to see a segment on custom builders as that movement is huge and has all makes/models/styles within it too. I liked that this film was something I could watch with my whole family to get them excited about riding. There weren't shots of tramp stamps and G-strings everywhere like some films might emphasize.

If you are trying to convey to a non-rider why you love to ride - this film should do it.",1399852800,,647,4.391666666666667
6077765,1,B00GHYIQ18,"After hearing that this was a modern On Any Sunday I was looking forward to watching this.
Was such a major letdown ... just clips of people talking about why they ride and very little real riding stuff.
It became fairly boring quite quickly ... if I could have giving it a half star thats what it would have got.",1399852800,,313,4.233333333333333
6077766,5,B00GHYIQ18,Loved the visuals and the narration from some of the great legends from the motorcycle world.  The scenes with the young riders (tiny tots) at the end were a joy to watch.,1399766400,,171,4.34375
6077767,5,B00GHYIQ18,I learned a lot from this wonderful movie.  Take the time to watch it and learn from its history offering.  Makes me appreciate the sport more than I did :),1399680000,,156,4.166666666666667
6077768,3,B00GHYIQ18,I thought it would be more focused on street. That being said the movie was okay.  Would not buy or watch again,1399680000,,111,4.045454545454546
6077769,3,B00GHYIQ18,"The concept is good but primarily focused on the racing aspect.... would have been nice if it would have showed more of everyday riders,  not overly interested in different types of motorcycle racing. ..",1399593600,,203,4.970588235294118

If you have been thinking about starting to ride-you will go buy a bike.",1399507200,,116,3.875
6077771,5,B00GHYIQ18,A really good job summing up the experience without getting trapped in any particular type or brand of bike. The style and imagery were top notch. I purchased because I am sure it will help me explain the need for me to ride to others.,1399507200,,235,4.2444444444444445
6077772,5,B00GHYIQ18,"This movie explains every reason to ride. If you already ride. Then you have to get it. It give you chills to hear the same for all the same reasons why you and I ride. Beautiful written documentary. I cant explain how much I enjoy this movie. I shared it with all my friends in family. It makes you laugh, makes you agree and even touches your inner soul. Dont think twice just buy this movie. You will not regret this purchase.",1399420800,,429,4.2439024390243905

6077775,5,B00GHYIQ18,A new take on Any Given Sunday from the 70s and nicely done. I believe they could have expanded a lil more but this movie is definitely entertaining and informative,1399248000,,164,4.5
6077776,5,B00GHYIQ18,"I really enjoyed ""Why We Ride"".  It is basically an updated version of ""On Any Sunday"". It has a bit of motorcycling history mixed with inspiring interviews of riders of different types of bikes. The interviews, history, and filming are all excellent.  I think the show did a fantastic job of capturing the passion that people have for motorcycles in a way that even non-riders could understand.  My wife, who refuses to ride with me, watched it with me and enjoyed it as well.  Even if she still doesn't quite understand the motorcycle connection, she at least realizes I'm not the only one out there that is obsessed with this form of transportation.

I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves motorcycles, or to anyone that loves a motorcyclist.",1399248000,,756,4.7846153846153845
6077777,3,B00GHYIQ18,I only watched about half of this rental. I kept falling asleep so I just turned it off. Basically it was a bunch of interviews.,1399161600,,128,4.16

6077782,4,B00GHYIQ18,"Great film if a bit long winded in talk and not enough coverage of all the types of motorcycling around the world. No mention of the Dakar or enduro riding. Very American-moto centric, which is great, but doesn't cover how big motorcycles are around the world.",1398556800,,260,4.673913043478261
6077783,5,B00GHYIQ18,This movie had two bikers in tears as we related to so many of the stories that were told.  This is the new generation of On Any Sunday.  Brilliant every rider should watch.,1398470400,,173,4.212121212121212
6077784,5,B00GHYIQ18,"Something for every motorcyclist, no matter what variety of riding you do.  Very nicely presented.  Loved the end where they told you who each of the people interviewed were, and what their involvement in motorcycles is.",1398470400,,220,5.083333333333333
6077785,5,B00GHYIQ18,Great story and explanation of why we do what we do! I recommend this movie for everyone to watch with an open mind.,1398384000,,116,4.086956521739131
6077786,5,B00GHYIQ18,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Not a biker flick by any means, but it shares the common bond that all walks of motorcyclists share.  It is especially inspiring during those long cold winter nights when you need your fix of two wheeled freedom and are itching for Spring.  Wonderful humanistic approach the old question of ""Why does anyone ride a motorcycle?"", and the ""If I had to explain, you wouldn't understand"" crowd.  Well shot and edited.  I was really impressed with this documentary for the common two wheeled enthusiast. Did I mentioned that I liked?",1398384000,,561,4.873684210526315
6077787,4,B00GHYIQ18,I've been riding since 1967.  Only other movie that I would give 5 stars is On Any Sunday.  This movie will probably be considered up there as time goes on.  I thought it was well done and put what I love to do in a true positive light.  Programs like Sons of Anarchy do nothing but ruin a great life style/sport/family fun.,1398297600,,324,4.17741935483871
6077788,5,B00GHYIQ18,If you ever rode a motorcyle (or wanted to) you'll love this.  Great photography and interviews .  You won't regret purchasing this one!,1398297600,,136,4.869565217391305
6077789,5,B00GHYIQ18,"Whether you ride on the dirt or the endless ribbon of roads you will enjoy and identify with the views in this documentary.  So many pertinent comments are made about how motorcycling makes you feel and what it does for the soul that I couldn't help but smile throughout. The interviews were informative and the history behind motorcycling was also fascinating. I highly recommend this film for any and all motorcycling enthusiasts. Oddly enough, once you finish watching the movie you feel like you're part of an extended family that spans multiple generations.  Very cool!",1398297600,,574,5.031578947368421

6077791,5,B00GHYIQ18,"Great movie.  Inspirational to say the least.  I hope there is a second movie that focuses more on trail riding and adventure riding across the globe.  Perhaps some enduros, hare scrambles, turkey runs and rally rides.",1398211200,,218,5.0
6077792,4,B00GHYIQ18,"I liked this movie quite a bit, but I'm already a rider. The real telling fact is that my girlfriend immediately said, ""I want to learn to ride right now!"". This says, to me at least, that the movie does a much better job of telling non-riders what the experience is like, and why they might like riding too.

There's a decent mix of riding footage- on road, off road, dirt track, etc. And probably the more amazing thing is the age range of the riders that are interviewed- From elderly ladies to kids probably less than 10 years old. Awesome to see such diversity in interests and riders, which is just another way to show non-riders just how well they'll fit into the riding community. Absolutely worth the watch.",1398124800,,716,4.507692307692308
6077793,5,B00GHYIQ18,Well done and great footage and dialogue of racings roots and how it used to be.  Too bad dirt track racing is losing its fan base now days.,1398124800,,140,4.0

6077795,5,B00GHYIQ18,"I'd recommend this movie to anyone who rides.  What I liked the most is that It's an unbiased look at riding.  Cruisers, Super Sport, Dirt to Vintage.  The Stories are very touching and inspirational.  Easily one of the best riding movies I've ever watched.",1398038400,,257,4.7727272727272725
6077796,3,B00GHYIQ18,"This is a good movie if you love motorcycle racing.  I am more into street riding and touring, which it does contain some, but not enough for my taste.  Either way, it was definitely worth watching. Lots of interviews with riders and racers. Now if they did another one that covers more of the street and touring side of the sport i would buy it in a heartbeat.  But truly worth a view if you like the world on 2 wheels.",1398038400,,420,4.160493827160494
6077797,5,B00GHYIQ18,"Showed this film to my MC club several wks. ago.  The unanimous opinion was that this was a winner!  Each member came to me separately and asked if I could show it, again, with non-riding spouses present, since it captures the essence of why we are so engaged with motorcycling.  Doesn't matter if you ride a cruiser, sportbike or dirt bike, you'll understand the emotion you've been feeling.",1397952000,,392,4.735294117647059
6077798,5,B00GHYIQ18,Loved this documentary. Touches on the history of motorcycles. My favorite was the interviews with regular people who ride. Highly recommend this to film to everyone,1397865600,,165,5.384615384615385
6077799,5,B00GHYIQ18,was gonna go to a special screening at a movie theatre for $20 bucks apiece so it would've cost me $40.  I bought the dvd we watched it & it was very good & then we loaned it to several of our riding friends,1397779200,,207,3.7045454545454546
6077800,5,B00GHYIQ18,I rented this in HD and id say its not an awesome movie but its a very good one to have. I ride myself and i can relate to the things in this movie the emotions and excitement.

6077802,5,B00GHYIQ18,This video exposes the viewer to many aspect of motorcycling and its heritage.  It is incredibly filmed and narrated.  It's a must see for any one who rides or is considering riding.,1397001600,,182,4.65625
6077803,3,B00GHYIQ18,"The movie was done well, but I thought it would be much more about the different subcultures of riding and the people that fall into those different categories. This was mostly about motorcycle racing and the history of racing. So, if you're into motorcycle racing , then buy the DVD. It only briefly touched on what I thought this would be like, the different styles of riding and bikes, and the cultures behind them. I thought the trailer was actually better than the DVD, and a little misleading. Bottom line, if you're into the history of racing, this is for you. If that's not what you're looking for, then don't waste your money. Just watch the trailer.",1397001600,,659,4.641025641025641
6077804,3,B00GHYIQ18,"I wanted to love this, but only like it...and not for the content. The film is stunningly beautiful but the title is misleading in my opinion. The film should be called ""why i motocross"" or ""why i gp race"" since thats what most of the film is about. The few spots they talk about what us average road riding bikers would be interested in they quickly fly through and get back on racing. I'm glad I rented this instead of buying it, if you must see, hear, and read all things motorcycle then check it out, if you truly want to see why we ride check out ""Easy Rider"", a below average film but one that accurately in my opinion captures the spirit of of a biker, no chief, no tribe, no watches, just riding.",1396656000,,704,4.222222222222222

6077809,3,B00GHYIQ18,"I've been riding motorcycles for forty years.  When I'm not riding motorcycles, I thinking about them.  I thought this video was really, really overly sentimental.  A little too ""touchy-feely"", ""zen"", ""one with the bike"" and backed with sappy violin music.  Other than that, I liked it.",1396483200,,286,5.1521739130434785

It effectively communicates to the non-riding public the passion riders feel for the sport / lifestyle.

The filmmakers help capture the true spirit of being a biker and told inspirational and fun stories. This is a great way for non-bikers to see what the big deal is and how this passion is a life-long, family affair.

6077826,3,B00GHYIQ18,Why We Ride is a overall good movie but in the end I was left thinking something was left out and wanting more.  This movie gave some good history but transitioned to more of a race biased movie. I ride for the freedom and solitude. I know its not about me but the director should have journeyed across America to get other point of views. True racing is a big part of the motorcycle community but it isn't the only reason why many of us ride nor what got us to ride. True other reason for why we ride were mentioned but the focus went right back to racing.  This movie really highlighted California but what about the rest of the U.S.  I wanted a 5 star movie but I only got 3.,1395100800,,678,4.082706766917293

My husband has been riding for over 50 years, and for him it's not a choice to not ride. He tells me it keeps him sane, grounded, and he looks forward to riding every chance he gets. It was also an interesting and entertaining film; I highly recommend it.",1394323200,,382,4.4714285714285715

It's about ""Why We Ride.""  I've been riding since I was a kid and it touched my heart in several ways.  It covers inspiring people, families who ride together, hill climbing, riding with groups, etc., but all of this with the focus on why we love to ride motorcycles.",1393804800,,430,4.271604938271605

6077866,3,B00GHYIQ18,We enjoyed this video but then we are novice motorcycle riders who didn't know the history of motorcycles. So the history presented was interesting to us. I can certainly see that more data could have been presented. They may have overdone a bit in the area of saying over and over that those in the video liked bike riding.,1393632000,,324,4.508474576271187
6077867,5,B00GHYIQ18,"I really enjoyed this documentary. From the largest names in motorcycling history to the average Joe it gives those who don't know what they are missing insight as to, well, why we ride. The passion and love for two wheels is captured as each person tells what it means to them. From the rider who enjoys solitude to the family who uses it as their quality time you will get a feel of what it is to enjoy the greatest sport on Earth.

Could not have hoped to say it better.
I'm 54 years old and only started riding 5 years ago.
This film says exactly how I feel about riding.
Amazing!  But also a beautifully produced documentary.  Anyone with just a little curiosity on the subject, will come away...
Wanting to ride.
..and being one who rides; in Detroit, in the dead of winter...well, this film will be like a shot of adrenaline for any frost bitten rider wondering if Spring time will ever get here!
One last thing,  the cinematography is inspired.

My family and I sat down to watch movie, and it was amazing. I believe we watched it at just the right time. You see, my daughter has been trying to learn how to ride her mini dirt bike and was having a hard time. This movie helped her to see the love and community aspects of what riding gives you.( and so much more)  The next morning she was outside hitting the dirt. This movie inspired my daughter to want to ride, and for that I couldn't be more grateful!

There are some great vistas in the film along with entertaining historical information.

I don't own a car only two wheels for me so again I loved it. But I bought it for my wife to watch to hopefully explain to her why I spend all this money on bikes. To my disappointment it focused too much on interviews and mostly only racer interviews. Not on why the average person should throw a leg over a bike and support their biker family members. All my wife saw is loads of people who like to race which translated to lots of people who like to ""waste money"" in her mind. I wish they would have extended the extremely short family riding segments. I agree with a previous comment it should be called ""why we race"" not why we ride. That being said I'm happy with the purchase I love bikes of all types and it was a fun way to spend time with my spouse (for me at least lol)",1392854400,,911,3.9297297297297296

6077896,5,B00GHYIQ18,"This film captures the soul of the biking way of life better than any I have seen. It is bang up to date and relevant for our time, but the thoughts, feelings and values expressed in it touch a chord in the heart that will surely stand the test of time in years to come. What I especially liked about it is that it avoided the usual cliched ""Born to be wild"" type of sound track and flashy short-cut images and rapidly changing camera angles that producers so often use to jazz up anything to do with motorcycles. This film is primarily a piece of art, with a thoughtful reflective soundtrack, gentle sweepng camera work and expertly edited personal testimonials from riders and motorcycle industry insiders.
The feeling one is left with is one of having been bathed in the warmth and passion of a philosophy not blasted with love it or hate it imagery. I think this film, more than any I have seen before, clearly drws a line uder the past hell-raiser image of bikers, and establishes a new and more realistic paradigm of bikers as family people, philosophers, nature lovers and humanists. In my view this was a very mature and well thought out approach to a way of life that so many of us enjoy.

There is so much to see that I have watched it multiple times. One time I will be enthralled with the bikes and the backdrop and the next the stories that are told by those in the movie. The cinematography, choice of music and editing is of such a quality to be inspirational.
 The narration done by Ted Simon in his description of his travels is so telling in regards to the ""age of social media"", that it will strike a cord and resonate loudly with most riders over the age of 50. You will hear the call of a simpler time when riding was so basic, just you and your bike.
 Dave Barr's story is so compelling that you will never put off another ride because of some small inconvenience. You will feel like such a wimp if you do. And Cody's mom battling breast cancer immediately after he was born will cause you to be choked up if you've ever dealt with any serious illness. My wife's battle with cancer is the direct reason that I'm riding again today after a decade long hiatus.
 The only drawback I can see is that before the movie I ""only"" owned two bikes, and now I have a third! This is the best purchase I have ever made and have shared it with my other riding buddies. You will never regret buying this movie!",1392508800,2,1357,4.231660231660232

6077908,3,B00GHYIQ18,"Beautiful photography and interesting commentary by people in the motorcycle industry and the sport, as well as a few regular folks. That said, there is way too much reliance on slow motion, the soundtrack manages to be both bombastic and sappy, and the commentary is repeated over and over with slightly different words.

Maybe if you'd never seen another motorcycle movie and there were two feet of snow on the ground you might find this interesting. I'm currently laid up with a broken leg (not motorcycle related) and I had to force myself to sit through the movie. Not something I'd watch again.",1391904000,,600,4.825242718446602

And so many of the reasons we ride are visceral rather than cerebral ... again, most find words inadequate when pressed for an answer. This documentary, as it claims, is the best comprehensive statement from the motorcycle riding community of who we are and why we ride ... told in a form that most, even outside the audience of those who ride, will understand and feel what riding means to us. Exceptionally articulate and superbly choreographed with anecdotal action to put exclamation points behind each perspective. It should not be missed and certainly belongs in the library of every rider who has to explain to a parent, friend, or spouse ""Why We Ride.""",1391299200,,778,4.813432835820896

However ... I am not one of those motorcycle outlaws or rowdies. Most of the time I enjoy making a tour with my friends.
So I am not a member of a 'motorcycle club' and I hate all those idiots (as last time in NYC) who give us biker a bad image.
This movie shows everybody how the motorcycle was born and how and mostly WHY people are attracted to ride a bike.
It a film showing not only beautiful landscapes and all shapes and models of bikes but also the people and their families.
That film is the best way of showing a 'non-biker' - as the title says - 'why we ride' and also why bikers are so unique at all.

When I shared this movie with my friends on 240 Hz TV, with a Bose Sound System, all of them wanted to go on a motorcycle ride.  It seems that the media always wants to focus on the negative side of motorcycling, the Outlaw Gangs, the Newbie Sport bike riders and Drunk Cruiser riders, riding without helmets and driving at absurd speeds. (Not that I ever advocate wearing a motorcycle helmet, but, just that the media seems to focus on this concept).
This Movie is a refreshing breath of AIR!  If you ride motorcycles, scooters, ATV's or Side by Sides, you will probably love this movie.  If you ever thought about purchasing a Motorcycle, scooter or ATV and found that you couldn't afford one, you probably shouldn't watch the movie, because you will go out and buy a motorcycle, scooter, or ATV.",1391040000,,968,4.6104651162790695

The entire DVD is well thought out, the photography is absolutely stunning and the fact that they have included historical footage, makes it a complete story. It is packed with brilliant and inspiring stories, and is not only geared towards people who currently ride motorcycles, but even those who dont. If this DVD does not inspire anyone currently not riding a motorcycle to start riding one, then nothing on earth will. The individual stories are truly inspiring, and highlight the bond and brotherhood that exists between motorcyclists and the freedom and pleasure gained from riding. A definite must-watch for anybody, and most probably one of the best gifts you could ever give a current biker.

As I was watching people describe their feelings and emotions about riding, all I could do was say ""YES YES YES!"" There are people that have a motorcycle and ride and the there are people that riding is everything. It is their religion. Riding is why you do everything else, just so you Can ride.

It was great to view a video that provided multiple stories and explanations of ""Why We Ride"".  Providing interviews that contribute to the thousands of reasons a person elects to welcome the sport of motorcycling into their lives was outstanding.  Although the reasons vary the root to the dedication and enjoyment people get out of riding is related to a love for the relationship one attains with a motorcycle and the people that surround the hobby and sport.

It was an amazing place an time. Really enjoyed the footage from there. Raced our stingray pedal bikes there too. Great memories.

It starts off as a very exciting documentary for motorcycle development & motorcycle racing history in the US.  But, it ultimately fails, because it very quickly turns into a far-fetched infomercial about how motorcycle riding cures cancer, motorcycle riding makes your kids eat their vegetables, and by golly motorcycles actually make criminals into model law-abiding citizens, dog darn it!  (Yah, right.)  Look.  All riders -love- motorcycles for different reasons.  But, please don't insult our intelligence with all the mushy stuff.

6077957,4,B00GHYIQ18,"If you love riding motorcycles, you'll probably enjoy watching this, once.

It is over-dramatized, I think 90% or 95% of the motorcycling shots are in slow motion, with dramatic music playing the in the background.  Which actually gets really annoying (the slo-mo more than the music).  There are a couple of real-time shots, and they are the most exciting scenes in the movie - bikes going 200+ mph at Bonneville, and some overhead shots of Moto GP racers.  If they showed more action at actual speed it would have been much better.  I mean like EVERY SHOT is in slow motion.

It was cool that everybody interviewed wasn't identified in the movie itself, until the end credits where they introduce themselves for the first time.  It was fun for me to try to figure out who the people were - Kenny Roberts, Keith Code, Mert Lawwill, and other icons were in the movie along with other people you wouldn't really know.

I'm disappointed that it wasn't more encompassing of different types of motorcycling.  It focused a lot on harleys, harley's racing history, sturgis, and the like.  It did show a little drag racing, flat track, moto GP, and some salt flat racing.  ADV/dual sport, touring bikes, and non-cruiser street bikes (sport bikes, cafe racers, Japanese classics) were pretty much overlooked.  It was very US-centric, and specifically California.

It's worth a watch but I doubt it will become a classic.  I was on the edge between three and four stars, but I gave it four because hey - it is about motorcycling and I like to support the effort.",1388361600,,1553,4.746268656716418

The positive is that you don't have to have a bike to understand this movie, it's for everyone.

I found the inspirational women of motorcycles story is long over due and needs it's own movie.

Wasn't sure what to expect, other than that it was about motorcycles. It covered many aspects of motorcycling, from history to hill climbs, to motorcycle clubs and family camping excursions centered around motorcycling.

Motorcycling is such a vast topic with so many people who love it and have their own unique understanding and niche, it would be difficult for a film to cover ALL of it.

But Why We Ride does a great job of covering many aspects. Note that it is not merely footage of dirt bikes sailing over dunes, such as you might see on a loop in a bike shop, for example. It is also not a step-by-step history/chronology of motorcycling and every single different type of bike (cruisers vs sport bikes vs dirt bikes, for example). Why We Ride focuses on the SOUL and the PASSION of what it means to be on a motorcycle, what it means to be a part of the global family of riders, and the unspoken LOVE understood by all. This is why it was so great that all of the speakers/actors in the film were introduced only at the conclusion during the closing credits. Because first and foremost, they love to ride.

The Good : Lot's of historical facts and video, Good race and off-road video and perspective.
The commentary and the speakers were good and the history they shared was insightful.

Missing : Very little coverage in relation to the above of cruiser, and touring material and video.
We got a few obligatory shots and comments about Sturgis and riding the Black Hills and almost nothing else as related to motorcycle touring activities.

I would have preferred to see and hear more about the folks who ride and tour the country on motorcycles. Video of the long open stretches of the interstate crossing the central US along with riding in the mountains of Colorado or the deserts of Arizona. How about following a rider or club through the Smokies or the Blue Ridge Parkway, or even the The Dragon ?

In my opinion, that would have given a more complete answer to ""Why We Ride""

8623444,2,B00GHYIQ18,"This is the motorcycle industry equivalent of the movie 'Armageddon'. If you loved that movie, you are probably going to think that I am a dick after you read my review, but you'll have to admit that I am not wrong. Long story short, the storyline and and film making is saccharine, lacks focus or narrative, and exploits some of the greats of the sport to shill for the motorsports industry to sell more motos, quads, etc. I only gave it two stars because there is some cool history contained within.",1532131200,,501,4.516483516483516

8623450,2,B00GHYIQ18,"I guess with a title like ""Why We Ride,"" it's hard to fault this movie for being self-indulgent, but it is. I kept waiting for the actual movie to start, because the endless stream of talking heads waxing philosophical about freedom and feeling the wind in your hair flows like a trailer or an intro to the good stuff. But there is no good stuff, just people talking about what bikes mean to them, mostly boring footage that looks like it belongs in a commercial, subpar camera work, and over the top dramatic music.

The only reason I can figure for the high overall rating this movie gets is that there are just no good nonfiction films about motorcycling. Even laughably pretentious cliche stuff like 21 Days Under the Sky at least had a story and somewhat interesting scenery and music.

This is the sort of movie you put on loop at a trade show booth or at a big dealership, because it doesn't matter where you come in or leave. Five minutes of this movie, at any point in the hour and a half it lasts, tells you everything there is to hear.

Maybe this film is for you if you get really emotional about bikes and need to have that reinforced.",1527465600,2,1148,4.380281690140845

8623452,5,B00GHYIQ18,"My fianc has been riding since about 7 years old, and It is his passion. He saw a trailer for this documentary and kept watching it over and over. So I took it upon myself to see if it was something I could purchase, or if it was just an online video. I soon found it on amazon, and purchased it right away. If you have a passion for riding, it is worth every penny. This documentary is so deep and powerful. I swear I think I MIGHT have just seen a tear in his eye. This dvd came fast, and in mint condition. We still have zero issues, and it is being played at least 3 times a week. SO worth it!! Cover appears just as the picture, not one scratch, in protective and trusted packaging and delivery.",1522627200,,700,4.043165467625899
