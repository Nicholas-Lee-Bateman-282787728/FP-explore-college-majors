2158905,4,B00062IE1E,"I bought this set of video's after a friend said they are an amazing work-out, ""way better than the Windsor Pilates videos.""  While, I don't agree with that statement wholly, I do believe these video's are great.  My only criticism is that they put a lot of pressure on the wrists, which often is difficult for me; other than that I think they are great--have tons of variety so the 45 minutes flies by!",1122422400,11,403,4.4324324324324325
2158906,5,B00062IE1E,"I love this! After reading positive reviews of MTV Pilates and MTV Yoga, I decided to purchase the entire set. Kristen McGee is a great instructor, who's not overbearingly annoying or excessive in her instructions; yet she guides you with breathing and posture throughout each video.

MTV Yoga is great for beginners and intermediate practitioners of yoga; the workout is stimulating and invigorating. I would not recommend doing MTV Power Yoga until you have mastered MTV Yoga completely; Kristen uses many of the poses in MTV Yoga and goes beyond; it really gets your heart pumping and you sweating! A great cardio workout!

MTV Pilates is also great for those beginning pilates. I would consider myself at the intermediate level and I definitely found it challenging. MTV Pilates Mix is more difficult, with two thirty minute workouts. I use the 10 minute bonus routine if I don't have a lot of time.

Overall, this set is great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to get in shape, lose weight, have fun, and learn pilates and yoga, no matter at what level you begin! Both MTV Power Yoga and Pilates Mix offer the opportunity to expand upon what you learned in MTV Yoga and Pilates and get a great cardio workout.",1119398400,40,1238,4.775700934579439
2158907,2,B00062IE1E,"This set was a big disappointment.  I have been using Hemelaya Behl's dvd for a couple of years and thought that I might try something faster-paced.

I won't say that this is not yoga, but it is not the sort of yoga practice that I want to do.  I consider myself to be in pretty good shape and I ended up pulling a calf muscle doing one of the pilates workouts.

If you are into aerobics and want to add some yoga to the mix, give this set a try.  It just isn't for me.

I do recommend Behl's dvds over this one.

I will be selling my mtv set.",1105574400,15,543,3.881818181818182
2158908,5,B00062IE1E,"What better way to learn how to lose weight other than by the subdued glow of MTV, the broadcast that has given us the perfect bodies of those pseudo-real people of The Real World and have challenged us with that never old question who realy is the winner of The Battle of the Sexes? Who else could tell us that our already average human bodies need to be beaten down, restricted from nutritious pleasures and stretched like playdough in order to have a satisfy our desires for lust and even more importantly, true love.

I have followed MTV's workout for the past 4 years even before this stellar DVD has come out and I have gone from a 5'8, one-hundred and twenty-pound girl to a 5'8 one-hundred and thirteen-pound bootylicious mamma! A must buy!",1104883200,9,748,4.582089552238806
2158909,4,B00062IE1E,"I had been wanting to get into yoga for awhile, but I thought I might want to try pilates and I couldn't make up my mind, but then I found this pack. They all have good workout music, but don't expect words, its just music. My fav is the yoga, pilates was a bit hard for me (this is from a person who has never done yoga and barely ever worked out) and power yoga is ok after you get the hang of yoga. I highly recommend this for begginers or intermediate (they have begginer, intermediate, and advanced positions on each tape.) :)",1104451200,6,531,4.165048543689321
2158910,1,B00062IE1E,"I hate these videos. They move too fast for beginers and are usless for anyone else. Do not buy these, it is a waste of money.",1101945600,5,126,3.8846153846153846
2158941,4,B00062IE1E,"I attend live pilates and yoga classes and these DVDs are great substitutes when you want to work out from home or cant find time to make it to a gym.  I prefer the pilates DVDs over the yoga ones, but Kristin McGee does a great job of proving instruction for practioners at all levels.",1296432000,,286,4.2
2158942,5,B00062IE1E,I haven't used each video yet but have made it through 2 of them. They left me sore and sweating! Great videos to pop in for a 30 min quick work out or extend and make it longer if you'd like. I've used a few different yoga and pilates videos and have been very happy with the workouts created in these for both beginner to advanced.,1283126400,,333,4.0606060606060606
2158943,5,B00062IE1E,"This set of DVDs is very nice!

1. Yoga..Vinyasa Flow Yoga for bigginers and intermadiates.
2. Power Yoga..Simple ""Power Yoga conditioning"" not only for yoga-practitioners but also for athletes.
3. Pilates..Basic Pilates for developping core muscles.
4. Pilates Mix..Training for Upper body and lower body.

Highly well-balanced training method. You will realise that the physical prowess of Miss Kristin McGee!",1254182400,,411,5.833333333333333
2158944,4,B00062IE1E,"I loved this set! I started with simple pilates and then went on with pilates mix and finally started yoga. Although that yoga one is supposed to be for beginners, it was a challenge for me the first week.
I also found that you kinda start learning what excersise is going to be next and that gives you the opportinity to be very focused in the excersises and not on the TV explanation.
On the first sessions, I really felt the great job in my muscles! ""no pain no gain!"" So I was very happy! But after a few weeks, my body got used to it even when it I was performing the advanced version. That's when I decided to change routine or video and that really helped to keep challenging my body!
I loved the pilates part as it's like ballet but in the floor. Pilates videos really help you gaining strengh on the ab part of the body. I don't know quite yet if this can make you loose weight because I always try to eat balanced but I guess sports is part of it.

-Kristin McGee is very good at this and she's just cheering you up all the time (even when she even doesn't know about you :)but it's good for you when you're working out). Her instructions are clear, calm, with a very good attitude, and she is always recalling positions, postures, the beginners-interm-adv versions.
-You can always watch another person performing the version you want to follow. The video cameras are in the correct places.
-There's also a chapter where you can find more explanations about every posture and the correct way to perform them. I think that the ab, and arm parts are the tough ones because the leg one is very easy.

It's a very good light/beginners fast training you can use every morning. I highly recommend it. You can even try two and a half routines a day; but don't mix pilates with yoga! hahahaha You'll finish very, very tired with your heart bumping just trying to recover for 15 mins!!!",1248393600,,1888,4.3914285714285715
2158945,5,B00062IE1E,the yoga workouts are quite demanding but at last it is a video that does not explain all the basics all the time. you really get some work done and you still get the basics if you want to!,1224892800,,189,3.871794871794872
2158946,5,B00062IE1E,"I am slightly experienced in Yoga and Pilates; however, experience was not necessary to move through this set.  Kristin McGee does a wonderful job explaining poses (without having you stand there for 2 minutes holding the same pose).  The workouts flow nicely and there are always three people behind her: one to demonstrate each level of expertise and Kristin is very attentive to the beginner as well as the expert.  So far I have done the Pilates, the Yoga and the Power Yoga and have found that they each serve a great purpose.  For a low intensity workout start with the Yoga, then the Pilates, then move to the Power Yoga.  This set grows with your stamina and experience.  The other great thing about this set is the breathing time in between exercises.  These workouts definitely increase my heart rate without creating exhaustion (or dripping sweat). I recommend this for anyone who enjoys yoga and pilates or even for those who are just starting out and would like to experience a little bit of both.",1209081600,,1010,4.7371428571428575
2158947,4,B00062IE1E,"Awesome four pack, **BUT** check out mtv's website  before purchasing here.  I found out it was a couple of bucks cheaper there.  Otherwise a great set!",1203811200,,152,4.769230769230769

2158949,5,B00062IE1E,"Kristen McGee gives excellent queuing and instruction and is very charming and encouraging on this challenging and effective 4 dvd series.  Used together on a rotating basis 4-5 days/week will give you a toned, fit body.  For days when you are rushed she includes a quick, effective pilates ""fix"" (15 minutes) and a short ""extra"" pilates abs routine.",1199232000,,350,5.017241379310345
2158950,5,B00062IE1E,"I highly recommend these DVDs for anyone who wants to get into pilates and yoga. Kristen McGee does a great job of explaining what she's doing during the exercise and breaking down the positions at the end. One suggestion: if you are a beginner, it would probably be a good idea to watch the position break down before doing the workout so you don't injure yourself.

I have taken yoga and pilates classes at my gym and some of the instructors were really bad (i.e. didn't clearly explain what they were doing, hardly ever came around to make sure you were in the correct position, went too fast...). At least with the DVDs you can go at your own pace (rewind, ffwd, pause), actually see the instructor (instead of having a bunch of people in your way), and most off all learn how to do the exercise properly to get the full effect!

I feel simply amazing, many thanks to Kristen McGee!",1185235200,2,886,4.462962962962963
2158990,4,B00062IE1E,"Ok,ok the video is clear and they have special sections on each disc that breaks down the poses. I tried this and it's ok, but really I felt I should have taken an introduction to yoga class first. Which eventually I did.",1176768000,,221,4.285714285714286
2158991,4,B00062IE1E,"I love these dvds. The two ""beginning ones""- Yoga and Pilates are great everyday workouts or something to throw into routine to mix it up every now and then. Each DVD has modified workouts for beginner, intermediate and advanced which I find very helpful. Kristen Mcgee also breaks down the excercises into easy to follow directions. Power Yoga and Pilates Mix are definately more difficult but beginners can pop them in when they desire a challenge. These DVD's are very good and I would highly reccommend them.",1175040000,,512,4.896551724137931
2158992,5,B00062IE1E,The MTV Fitness Pack is a great variety for your next exercise program.  These videos can help you really focus on specific areas of your body.  I swear by pilates when it comes time to fit into my summer clothes.  By doing one or all of these videos the pounds just melt away in no time.  These videos are easy to follow and you can be done in no time.,1172620800,,353,4.0
2158993,5,B00062IE1E,"I gave these DVD's to my daughter for Christmas.  She says that they are more than she expected.  The DVD's have beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of exercise.  And they are very easy to follow.",1168819200,,203,4.742857142857143

Being a runner and weight lifter, I am new to work videos but I found these challenging and fun.  I really like Kristin McGee.  I like her energy and she is a skilled instructor. She just tells you what to do and how to do it and encourages you to challenge yourself.  I also bought the Power Yoga from her website.  It is great, also.",1154044800,7,491,4.126315789473685
2158995,5,B00062IE1E,these workouts were great!  the instructor is energetic and encouraging... the power yoga video was fast-pased (newcomers to yoga should probably watch it a few times before doing it) and the pilates mix were 2 great 30 min. workouts if you are in a hurry.  by far the best pilates and yoga workouts (video or in person) that i have ever done!,1142294400,7,343,4.516129032258065
2158996,5,B00062IE1E,"I've only tried the regular pilates and regular yoga DVDs (as opposed to Power Yoga and Pilates Mix) but I'm a beginner.  They're definitely challenging but there are only one or two things that I can't do on them.  One great thing that I love on these DVDs is that you don't have to pick and choose beginner or advanced levels between different DVD chapters or anything.  There are 4 people doing the exercises and 1 is for beginner, 1 for advanced and 2 for intermediate.  If you can't do some of the exercises at one level, you can just watch another person and do them at a lower level.  I think this is definitely a great item and definitely don't be afraid if you've never done pilates or yoga before (like me!).",1140480000,7,718,4.368421052631579
2158997,4,B00062IE1E,Teaching pilate/yoga Kristen Mcgee is a wonderful instructor.  He DVDs are challenging and flow from one exercise to another.  These are high intensity workouts.  This will get results and also the music in the background is great!!!!!,1140480000,3,235,5.297297297297297
2158998,4,B00062IE1E,"Every serious exerciser should strive to achieve that which cannot be fully executed the first time (or first few times) a workout is tried.  MTV's Power Yoga and Pilates Mix are very in touch with this concept in that they are difficult enough for even the most advanced of users, but include beginner and intermediate poses and options for those striving to become advanced.  Exercisers at all levels will be challenged without being discouraged, and results are fast.  The journey towards fully executing each pose with full power is an exciting experience.

Mcgee is an excellent instructor whos verbal cues are detailed enough to perform on without even watching the screen (for a newbie maybe after the first one or two times through watching you could go without).  Yet, unlike some other DVDs I have tried, Mcgee is not overbearing or annoyingly repetitive with her instructions.",1130803200,19,887,5.0479452054794525

8036924,5,B00062IE1E,"Got back into yoga after a hiatus of about 10 years. I wound up trying some other discs and YouTube videos to relearn everything, but in the end, I wound up going back to the disc that got me started in the first place: MTV Yoga. Within a session or two, I was back into my poses and feeling the difficulty all over again. After a few more sessions, the flexibility started to return. I did the Power Yoga once...only once. I need to be able to do the more advanced versions of the poses in the regular Yoga before I move onto the Power Yoga. Then I'll need to do the Pilates session in the Power Yoga DVD before moving onto the Pilates DVD itself.

I have absolutely zero regrets buying this again (I had misplaced my original DVD) and highly recommend it for anyone who has ever wanted to try to get into yoga but didn't want the cheesy, new-age type music and ""soothing"" instruction.",1464480000,,886,4.3053892215568865

I get very bored doing the same thing everyday so I do this about once a week and mix with biking, a ballet workout dvd, jogging and zumba class.  But the video itself is not boring.  And the mix dvd has 3 different workouts on it so you can choice or do 2.  Enjoyed this as a beginner to yoga and pilates.",1402876800,,454,3.934065934065934

I find Kristin McGee to be perfect for these types of workouts and instruction. There's beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of each pose so you can follow either one, depending on your fitness level. I do find them to be easier as I continue to do them, so they definitely work. My core is much stronger and I'm more flexible than before. I try to do them at least twice a week. I would definitely recommend these DVDs for all levels of pilates and yoga. And don't worry that you are not getting a workout; you will feel this and sweat a little. Great workouts and I'll be moving on to the power yoga and pilates mix very soon. I'll update my review once I've tried the others.",1329436800,,850,4.352201257861635
