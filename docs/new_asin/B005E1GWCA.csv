4663389,5,B005E1GWCA,"Alright so we were brand new to the 2-Step and decided we would try it and for the money this DVD cost we had no problem in making the decision to go this route.  These instructors really break down the steps in a way that is really easy to follow along to.  I really liked that they started with just the rhythm of the dance because that is one thing I often have issues with other dances.

Great instructional tool to learn the two step.  Highly recommend it.  Also try out some of their more advanced moves dvds as we had great success with those as well.",1398816000,3,558,4.177570093457944
4663390,4,B005E1GWCA,Purchased so we could go dancing. And this makes it so easy. We used to just sit and watch from the side in amazement now we are out there two stepping it up! Date nights are much more exciting now!,1398384000,,198,3.975
4663391,2,B005E1GWCA,"I was expecting a lot more of the lessons.  I could have gotten this lesson on UTube.  Way overpriced, so disappointed, looking forward to some dance lessons beside going backwards.......",1391126400,2,187,5.2
4663392,5,B005E1GWCA,A great way to pick up new skills for the next dance! I love Shawn's teaching & Joanna's exuberance. The DVD setup makes it easy to go directly to the section you need to practice.,1367452800,,180,4.171428571428572
4663393,5,B005E1GWCA,"It can be frustrating buying a dance instruction DVD not knowing if you'll enjoy it, but you should take that chance with Shawn Trautman's DVD series, which are professionally put together in HD, with great camera work, excellent lighting, clear audio, and fabulous speakers.  Shawn and Joanna are naturals at communicating with the audience, great chemistry, and both have a great sense of humor.  The two-step 101: beginner country dance lesson DVD is very good and very enjoyable.

I've been dancing for years, having learned on my own, but that doesn't mean I learned all of the basic fundamentals.  Watching this DVD shows how much I've missed.  And if you miss out on the fundamentals, you'll have trouble over time in different areas of your two-step with rhythm, timing, how to lead (men), and how to follow (women), etc.

Guys, when you dance with a girl, but she declines to dance with you again, she won't tell you why, and often times it just may have something to do with how you lead, maybe you were difficult to follow, or maybe your hand placement is wrong (too high or too low) and uncomfortable to her.  Fix the basics!

This DVD is great for both men and women.  Ladies, instead of waiting for guys to teach you two-step on the dance floor, why not impress him by having an idea what you're doing ahead of time?  As fun as it is for some guys to teach new girls how to dance when you meet, it's even more fun when she already knows the basics, so we can move on to other intermediate dance moves w/o fumbling around.  Besides, there just isn't enough time to teach someone the basics on a dance floor during a 4 minute song, teaching has to be done out of a nightclub one-on-one, or you can use this DVD.

It's also very difficult if not impossible to master other intermediate/advanced two-step moves w/o getting the basics down.  One step at a time, this two-step 101 DVD is truly the first step!",1364515200,4,1917,4.537790697674419
4663394,4,B005E1GWCA,"The DVD is easy to follow and focuses on the fundamentals of 2 Step, i.e., foot movement, connection points, and movement. At the end there is an introduction to something more advanced, turning to change leads and then back again. While the other DVD's in the 2 Step collection are needed to master the 2 Step, I plan on buying those other DVD's based on the quality of the introductory DVD. A discount may be offered after the first purchase. An added bonus is that you can learn in private and for less cost than private lessons.",1364428800,,532,4.494845360824742
4663395,5,B005E1GWCA,"The Two-Step is a dance that I have been fascinated with for years, but could never 'get' it.  We finally bought this cd and have seen the 'light'.  Shawn explains that the Two-Step is 4 steps on 6 beats.  When you see experienced 'two-stepers' move across the floor, the rhythm is magical.  Shawn and Joanna break it down in beats, then stepping in place.  You practice this until your head memory, muscle memory and foot memory learn it.  Then he goes on to teach you styling and techniques.  I have given up on trying to take Two Step lessons locally, because they switch it from Quick quick, slow, slow, to Slow, slow, quick quick.  They say it doesn't matter, but it does.  That is why they changed it in the first place, to throw the ballroom dancers off. Shawn is a terrific teacher.  So glad we found him.",1363046400,4,813,4.4324324324324325
4663396,4,B005E1GWCA,"I assume it's as advertised, shipment was fast, and the DVD was a little high priced, but hope it was worth it.",1354492800,,111,4.090909090909091
4663397,5,B005E1GWCA,This package arrived as if it sprouted wings. I got it in just a couple of days! Wow! Can't wait to get started refreshing our dance moves so we can get back on the dance floor. We've just been too busy to practice but I'll write another review when we use this product. Just can't believe how quickly this arrived for us. Thanks!,1344124800,,330,4.253968253968254
4663398,4,B005E1GWCA,"We don't have a dancing background but we are having fun learning the basic two step, and the other transitions included in the training: the Basket (or Wrap), the Promenade (with side step and vine step), the One and a Half Torque Turn, and Sweet Heart (side by side). Currently planning on purchasing additional training DVD's by Shawn.",1337904000,,338,4.844827586206897

8467831,4,B005E1GWCA,"Nice instructional dance video. Easy to follow, easy to learn. Of course, my wife is already a good dancer, so that helps.",1472083200,,122,4.590909090909091
8467832,5,B005E1GWCA,"An Excellent video to learn the Two-Step.  The instruction from Shawn and Joanna broke down each element of the dance making it simple and easy to learn.  I especially appreciated the way they taught you to count the beats within the music before learning the dance steps.  I would recommend this video as the one of the best available to learn by.

8467833,3,B005E1GWCA,"Yes, this is definitely 101.  I was hoping for a few more steps other than real basic stuff, but perhaps my expectations were too high.  For the price, I would have wanted a little more.",1437955200,2,186,4.285714285714286
8467834,5,B005E1GWCA,Easily followed.  Good information for each partner and enough repetition that you will be a two step dancer in no time.,1435536000,,120,4.714285714285714
8467835,5,B005E1GWCA,Best way to learn how to two step is right here in one video super easy to follow and always keeps you engaged and on your feet. Throughout the whole thing I was wanting to keep going to the next part and learn something new do yourself a favor and get this for you your friends or who ever would want to learn. Makes learning a lot of fun even for someone who already knew how to dance this will take you from being just another guy to that guy on the dance floor that people look at and say wow he's smooth.,1430092800,,509,3.9514563106796117
