2444463,5,B000BX0VTG,this is one of bronson's best movies. I saw this many years ago and was glad to find it on DVD. If you don't like the movies about the 30's then you probably won't like this..but give it a chance..It follows Valachi's life in the mob and how he managed to out live the hit placed on him..,1220745600,3,288,3.9827586206896552
2444464,4,B000BX0VTG,"Great movie. Although, I purchased this movie as a gift for my husband, I really enjoyed it. Bronson, as usual, delivers great performance.",1214870400,,139,5.086956521739131
2444465,4,B000BX0VTG,"THE VALACHI PAPERS (1972) with the well known star, the late CHARLES
BRONSON, will interest those viewers with a passing curiosity on
crime phenomena, as well as fans of that actor and those interested
in the historical undercurrents of America, in matters of the
perpetual cat-and-mouse game of those operating within the legal
framework, with large sums of money at stake from commercial
operations, being the cops and robbers.

The picture is long in playing time.

The final product shows  high  filming quality, with unusual clarity
of the dialogs and script, a logical flow  in  which the story
unfolds (easy to understand.)

This movie is also not for everyone, or for the casual viewer,
considering the often vicious, homicidal behavior of the individuals
participating in the gang activities ( pistol shootouts, rub outs,
etc.)

It also shows the paradox of 1st and 2nd generation Italians in
America, struggling for supreme power and financial controls
over various revenue generating rackets (protection, alcohol,
commodities, etc.) in their own ethnic group, while remaining
proud of their cultural and other heritage.

The music is tastefully chosen, and the director indeed was capable
and brave enough to show some more private, realistic and humanistic
moments by the gang members, which tends to underline the
biographical, and true nature of the story told within, vs. the
fantasy tales, and robotic nonsensical behavior too often seen in
movies released post 1990's.

There is an admirable effort in portraying scenes at the turn of the
century, and the decades following WWII, with proper automobiles,
street scenes, clothes worn by the gangsters.

Overall, this picture is a genuine effort in telling the story of a
mob family from the perspective of a low-level member who managed to
live to tell his story to the world.",1196294400,14,1842,5.1891891891891895
2444466,4,B000BX0VTG,"This is an excellent movie I saw when it came out and again 35 years later. It's amazeing how close to the facts they made this flick. In my memory the special effects were better,lol,but the story is good.the special effects are on a par with the Gunsmoke series. I give it a A+ for story content and a  B for the Acting,and another B for the effects,because they were state of the art. Good movie if you want to see a REAL-LIFE MAFIA STORY.",1178928000,4,442,4.2
2444467,4,B000BX0VTG,"The Valachi Papers was shot at a time when common wisdom had it that gangster pictures were box-office poison, so the very American tale of Charles Bronson's Cosa Nostra soldier spilling the beans on his life in the mob in return for protection by the Feds ended up being shot at Dinocitta in Italy with French money and an English director (Terence Young, reunited with Dr No villains Joseph Wiseman - wonderfully hammy here - and Anthony Dawson) only to end up being discounted as a Godfather ripoff when Coppola's film became a surprise huge hit. Based on Joe Valachi's Grand Jury testimony that lifted the veil on the way the mob worked and was organized after years of denial of its very existence by J. Edgar Hoover, it's a well-crafted and enjoyable saga with none of the operatic grandeur that Coppola, Leone and De Palma would bring to the genre. There's not much in the way of historical or social context, more a catalog of greatest hits and internecine feuding, but it's done with some flair and is surprisingly entertaining. Bronson makes a good lead, with decent support from Walter Chiari and Lino Ventura, both surprisingly well dubbed. Unfortunately the dire Mrs Bronson, Jill Ireland, is along too, but she's not in it enough to do any damage.",1169337600,9,1261,4.762557077625571
2444468,5,B000BX0VTG,"This item was banned of circulation for many years in VHS format. It was a very hard to get. Fortunately due to the marvels of DVD it is again on circulation. As a movie collector I am I am very glad of seing again Charles Bronson acting with his wife, beautiful Jill Ireland, that at the time of the movie production (1972) has been suffering a severe illness that finally cut short her life a few years later. If you like Mafia, mobsters movies, this is a good item for you to buy. It tells chronologically a resumee of the life of JOSEPH VALACHI, the guy who opened the secrets of the COSA NOSTRA to the public on the 60's decade. Supposedly it is based on the BOOK THE VALACHI PAPERS by PETER MAAS, but -for good- there are some differences from the book in the movie that makes it more interesting due to the interpretation of DIRECTOR ROGER CORMAN (Also, Director of St. Valentine's Day Massacre, 1967, and many others)",1140048000,9,925,4.415204678362573

PG rated version featured here.  The disc is widescreen anamorphic as well, not full screen as noted by Amazon (the packaging also only notes ""widescreen"".)",1137283200,32,466,4.935897435897436
2444470,3,B000BX0VTG,"Having come out almost right after ""The Godfather"" (though the book came out much earlier), this movie tried to capitalize on Coppola's masterpiece and the publics' appetite for mob flicks, so it had big shoes to fill. By that comparison, it pales. On its own, it fits into the category of movies like, ""The St. Valentines Day Massacre."" It leaves a little bit to be desired in performances (cerainly in brand name actors aside from Charles Bronson), dialogue and editing/continuity. But the story it tells is true, based on a book that by itself tells the story  of a mobster turned informant because of the contract unjustifiably put on his head. The movie satisfies those who crave the ingredients offered in the mob genre- violence, hits, blood, betrayal, loyalty, misguided power hungry individuals, and mistrust. And it can be argued that the cast of largely unknown Italian actors lends a feel of authenticity to the movie. But it does come down to script, dialogue and what is done with it by those actors, and in that, though the movie is a guilty pleasure of mine, it does come up short. But it does detail the hierarchy of the mafia over several years, how that changed due to power struggles, and how it affected those who lived within it. Bronson's Valachi character is the sympathetic figure in this movie and the movie is told from his perspective and that of the FBI agent to whom he provides information- in violation of the oath of mob code of secrecy he's sworn to- in exchange for protection from his assailants (the agent being the only other familiar face in this movie- he from a late 60s/ early 70s police TV show, perhaps ""The Mod Squad""). There is some unforgettable dialogue, but unlike ""The Godfather,"" it's for more forgetable reasons. Example? At the funeral of an executed mobster, his widow pleads to Salvatore Maranzano, the head of the mob at the time, to bring life back to her husband. Maranzano's reply? ""I no can bring back the dead. Only keel the living."" That said, that's actually part of the appeal to this movie. It doesn't purport to be anything it isn't. On it's own devices this is an informative, if not entertaining movie. Not all mob movies, parcularly of this era or earlier, strived to the award winning excellence of ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Godfathers,"" even ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" or ""A Bronx Tale""- movies where the dilogue is as vital as the action. In this movie, the dialogue merely pieces the story together, and not much more. Couple other points of note. Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife, plays his wife in this movie. And perhaps the most notable to those who are fans of this movie, the sight of the Twin Towers in the background during one scene, in a movie that takes place starting in the 30s. That aside, taken on its own merits, as far as mob movies from its period, this one ain't so bad, which I admit isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.",1137283200,8,2905,4.684931506849315
2444471,5,B000BX0VTG,"This is one of the best movies on organized crime available.

The movie gives explicit and factual information on the history of the American Mafia from the original ""bosses"" through the making of the syndicate on through the Vito Genovese regime.

Joseph Valachi is in prison. He seems to be out of favor with his associates. A man with a knife attacks him but fails. Its solitary confinement for Joe. Is his food poisoned? He wants to see his lawyer. Joe survives another attack! But now it is a murder charge. A Federal Official arrives with news about an open contract! He gets to meet Don Vito. Some guys can't do the time, he says. Bad apples have to be removed. ""Who said you did anything wrong?"" [Note the looks on their faces.] Vito names a figure. Joe decides to talk to that Federal agent. Joe is sent to Ossining and meets his cellmates. They talk about business. There's a war on. It took Joe's gang a minute to pull a job, the police need two minutes to respond. This presents a history of gang warfare in New York city. Buster was brought from Chicago to kill a rival. An apartment is rented so the target can be watched. [Can a Tommy gun really fit into a violin case?]

Shots are fired, two men fall. What about the others? ""Initiative."" Valachi puts on a suit, he is initiated into the Cosa Nostra with a blood ritual. Joe is part of the family now, even if not from Castellamara. These conflicts can be compared to Imperial conflicts over colonies and their wealth. There are beatings, shootings, and the disposal of by- products. Death is an occupational disease, like soldiers in combat. A funeral is disturbed by the arrival of rivals. Can they arrange a truce that will be good for business? ""My condolences."" Later a rival is given a surprise early retirement. There are more shootings and killings [to provide action]. Valachi seeks refuge with the wife of a business associate. [Note the old-style refrigerator in the kitchen.] Joe is a good soldier. ""Maria is no toy."" Joe is invited back into the gang.

Genovese offers his friendship to Letizia, which can be more important than a lawyer or the police. Joe is sent out on a special operation, then reports back about a man who died from ""shortness of breath"". [A description of congestive heart failure.] Joseph and Maria are married. Many guests arrive to pay their respects and wish them happiness. Vito must vacation abroad. Can he start a business with drugs? Fixing a horse race can provide big profits. They learn about Vito's girlfriend's friend! [For shock value?] Don Vito returns and asks Joe to locate a man. This man will provide a ""gift"". Joe does him a favor. Later there is an assassination in a barber shop.

 There is a meeting at a country estate. Don Vito examines the faults of the organization. But shots interrupt the meeting! The NY State Police raid this meeting. Later two officials ask for information on the drug operation. Joe tells how drugs were smuggled into this country. Who stashed the drugs in Vito's home? ""Tony and Joe"" is the answer. Was a telephone tap used to get information? Joe is arrested and faces 15 years. Will he cooperate with a Senatorial investigation? Yes, and it is a national sensation in 1963. Vito offers $100,000 for Joe Valachi. [About a million today - and tax free.] Joe has remorse in his prison cell; he was depressed. They treat him at the infirmary. Will Joe outlive Don Vito?

The Valachi Hearings were a news sensation in the summer of 1963. [Until November.] Was this movie meant to cash in from that better movie from 1972? Is organized crime tolerated because of its benefits to the Establishment? The movie ""Key Largo"" used the return of a mob boss as part of its story. [Did it echo ""The Petrified Forest""?] No other administration before or after JFK went after organized crime like he did. Wonder why?",1386288000,,3635,4.6191950464396285
2444479,3,B000BX0VTG,Always like anything that Bronson played in.  Some movies plots not as good as others but he always seem to bring his talents to the forefront.  I just enjoy watching him and also hearing him.  A great voice.  He could play a comic role or straight dramatic one.  This was a good movie.,1380931200,,286,4.320754716981132
2444480,2,B000BX0VTG,"The movie is fragmented and boring. I believe it was based on what Valachi told the investigators; therefore, it makes the flow of the film choppy.

There's not much action and I did not expect much of them.

There's only one emotional scene where his friend, Gap, was killed for having an affair with the boss's wife. The relationship between Joseph Valachi and his wife was depicted too briefly to have an impact on me.

There's no suspense.

In short, it's better to read the book. There are better movies starring Charles Bronson.

I love Charles Bronson in movies such as Cold Sweat, Dead To Rights, Family of Cops 1, Family of Cops 3, Mr. Majestyk, Murphy's Law, Red Sun, The Evil That Men Do.",1371600000,,699,4.56
2444481,3,B000BX0VTG,"Actually while this film has some annoying weaknesses it's also got a lot of decent merit. For one thing it's pretty much dead-on accurate to the real events that took place during the early days of the mafia in NY city. While the film feels sort of like a spaggetti western due to the fact that it's a half American and half Italliain production, and the voices of some of the characters seem cheesy like they would in a spaggetti western, it's somewhat forgivable because the film has an honorable history. For one thing, if my memory serves correctly, it was released just weeks before The Godfather in 1972 and was overshadowed by the superiority of Coppola's fictional masterpiece, While the far more accurate story here got ignored. It's easy to understand why. This movie was simply produced fairly poorly. Like a cut below Sergio Leone's pretty great film about the mob, 'Once upon a time in America' which came more than 10 years later. I found it interesting that this film now has a PG rating, which it really shouldn't have. It's loaded with some rather harsh violence and nudity. In 1972 when it did have an ""R"" rating this movie was considered fairly brutal.. But times have changed I guess. I still think the film deserves a solid ""R"" anyway. Though the film has it's weaknesses it's really pretty decent. Bronson is perfect in the role of Valachi. The film tells the story like it really happened as apposed to The Gofather which was not the story of any real mafia family. This film tells it like it was, even if it's production values are at moments, rather laughable, complete with cookie cutter Italian music and cheap Itallian accents. The film does ok anyway. But in the hands of the right director it could have been even better. Over all though I think it's still very good despite it's production weaknesses.",1367625600,,1833,4.678018575851393

2444489,4,B000BX0VTG,"This movie is based on facts revealed by mob turncoat, Joseph Valachi, in 1963, and published as a book by Peter Maas (The Valachi Papers, same title as the movie).

Although the movie is based on Valachi's story, at least one scene never took place in real life (otherwise it would've been mentioned in the book because it's so spectacular). That's the scene where Valachi's friend, 'the Gap' (real name, Dominick Petrilli), gets his penis cut off in Valachi's restaurant by mobsters and afterward asks Valachi to shoot him, which he does. Maybe the movie people thought they needed a scene like the horse head scene in 'The Godfather'.
Too bad, because the rest of Valachi's story is true and inventing fictional scenes only compromises the authenticity of the story.

It's a very good movie and it follows the book closely, but it could have been a great movie had they had a bigger budget and some famous actors to fill out the parts. That said, some of the actors did a great job, such as Joseph Wiseman (Salvatore Maranzano) and the guy who plays Valachi's sidekick, the Gap. Charles Bronson acts very well too, of course.

If you like mob movies based on real life stories like 'Donnie Brasco', 'Goodfellers', 'Casino' etc.etc., then this movie is for you.

If you liked the movie, you should read the book too! It's one of those books you can't put down before you have read all of it. You can buy it here on Amazon and it's fairly cheap.",1259452800,4,1446,4.614785992217898

8093663,4,B000BX0VTG,"When I heard that Twilight Time was going to release THE VALACHI PAPERS I was ecstatic. As a fan of Charles Bronson it was one of the few films of his I hadnt seen in some time. Not only that if you wanted to see it you had to pay an arm and a leg for a copy of the film since it was out of print. Before this release Id seen copies going for around $50 online!

To start with the odds are pretty good that a number of viewers aren't even aware of who Joseph Valachi was. In the sixties Attorney General Robert Kennedy was aiming at taking on organized crime. The problem was most members of the organization kept quiet. Until Joe Valachi, after an attempt was made on his life in prison, came forward willing to tell all. It changed history as it presented the structure used by the organization and helped create a data base for law enforcement. His story was then told in book for by author Peter Maas who also wrote Frank Serpicos autobiography.

With this in mind the story was ripe to make into a film. The movie opens with an older Valachi in prison where he is given the kiss of death by mob boss Vito Genovese (Lino Ventura). When he fears he is being attacked, Valachi defends himself only to discover the man he killed was not part of the mob. Sentenced to life with no hope of parole and fearing another attempt on his life, Valachi agrees to inform on the mob and contacts federal agent Ryan (Gerald OLoughlin) to tell his tale.

The movie progresses in flashbacks to the early days of Valachi as a young man on the streets committing crimes like burglary. When it becomes apparent hes willing to do what it takes to make his bosses happy, he is recruited to become a member of the mafia. But it is also around this time that things are changing and a mob war is going on with two different factions wanting to take control. He survives this battle but comes out of it in the bad side of his boss, Tony Bender.

The film shows various crimes Valachi was involved in, his romance and marriage to the daughter of his boss (played by Bronsons real life wife Jill Ireland) and how things in the mob itself changed over time. Its never a deep rooted film based so much in facts and figures as it is the story of one man and the things seen through his eyes. Low budgeted and filled with a number of Italian actors since this was a film made in Italy, the movie is more of a glossed over slice of history rather than a dead on depiction.

That doesnt mean it isn't an entertaining film with plenty of story to tell. Bronson shines here, allowed to not only play the aging gangster but to play him in all parts of his life. This was something he rarely had the opportunity to do and one of the main reasons he agreed to play the part. There is enough action and bloodshed to keep people happy but Bronson has a chance to act rather than just be the tough guy here. The movie is interesting and moves at a steady pace that holds your interest from start to finish.

Twilight Time has done a solid job, as always, of offering a well-made presentation of this movie. The picture quality is fine and presents the movie in the best possible quality. The extras are limited to a single item, a partial isolated score track. The odds are that nothing was made to help promote the film when it was originally released making anything else non-existent. As with all Twilight Time releases this one is limited to only 3,000 so if you want this one at an affordable price then by all means pick one up immediately before they're all gone. If you're goal is to collect all movies starring Charles Bronson act fast.",1503878400,,3608,4.306332842415316
