Highly recommended.",1493251200,,124,5.944444444444445
8635657,5,B00HT5W2KA,"I bought the Vicol blu-ray version of this title and am very happy with it. I'm writing this review specifically to let people know that the English subtitles of the Vicol release are very good. I asked the previous reviewer about them, and she was right on the nose. But as that info is contained in comments, I thought I'd add this upfront. Good movie, good subtitles, good visual quality equals great blu ray disk to me. :)",1459382400,,426,4.4743589743589745
8635658,5,B00HT5W2KA,"I love a good mystery and nobody writes them better today than Higashino Keigo.  He really deserves to be better known to the western world, he ranks right up there with Rex Stout, Dorothy Sayers and Conan Doyle as one of the best detective writers I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.

This dvd is in the series of 'Galileo' stories with Physicist Yukawa solving another tough mystery.  I highly recommend all of the 'Galileo' series along with the Shinzanmomo detective Kaga stories.  He has many others that aren't part of a series and they are wonderful as well.  You can find the videos to view online at places like dramafever, gooddrama.net.",1408492800,3,650,4.767857142857143
