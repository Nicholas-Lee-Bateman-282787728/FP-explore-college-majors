The picture has been touched up, and the sound is decent. Since I have to watch it with many classes I grew tired of it after a while, but a great quality film.",1288742400,,355,4.144927536231884

The Four star is for the price.

Thanks Amazon!",1273190400,,197,4.6
8351521,1,B0025ZIG8G,"I'm extremely disappointed with this.  I remember seeing parts of ""Mr. Wonderbird"" years ago and I hoped that this ""remastered"" edition would have good sound and picture quality.  That is not the case.  This is a transfer from the same old dirty, scratched-up print that everybody else uses.  It has murky sound and blurry video ... The picture quality is actually comparable to a YouTube video:  It was encoded at low resolution and badly compressed so that mpeg artifacts show all blocky in many scenes.  For $14.95, this is absolutely unacceptable.

Content-wise, I understand that this is a truncated version of a much longer French film which was released before the movie was finished.  It feels unfinished.  Some of the action is abrupt, some of the acting is inexplicable, and the plot doesn't make much sense.  The action is slow and boring, the voice acting (though done by some reputable performers) sounds sort of half-hearted or rushed ... and the characters are so odd-looking, this movie will not appeal to children.  Animation is not just for kids anyway, but in this case it definitely isn't.

The movie itself holds certain fascinations if you're an animation enthusiast.  The character designs are interesting and original.  Most of the animation is very good, but some of it looks rushed, like bad TV-quality work.  The background designs are very lush, with a European surrealist and expressionist flair.  There are socialist revolutionary overtones throughout.

Sadly, ""Mr. Wonderbird's"" slim merits are undermined by the crappy quality of the DVD.  If you're interested in seeing it, get the cheaper edition.  This one is a complete rip-off.  If I could award zero stars, I would.  A thoroughly bad job from A2ZDVD.",1247443200,3,1738,5.070671378091872
