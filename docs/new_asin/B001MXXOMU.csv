8322378,4,B001MXXOMU,"This film dramatizes the often ignored but important journey of Lenin and his Bolshevik cohorts out of their Swiss exile to revolutionary Russia which had recently overthrown the Tsar. The story itself is almost unbelievable....about how reactionary German/Prussian militarists conspired with a handful of Russian Marxist/Socialist revolutionaries to overthrow the new, quasi-democratic Russian government in order to force Russia out of World War I, thus freeing of German divisions to be transferred to the Western Front in order to try to knock out the British and French Allies before the Americans were able to tip the balance against the Germans with fresh manpower.  It is incredible how a country like Germany could think a couple of dozen political misfits could shake an entire country like Russia, but cynical, conspiratorial people like Parvus, who played both sides against each other were able to discern that a single-minded fanatic like Lenin could effectively destabilize the shaky new Russian regime.

The film shows at length Lenin's odd relationship with his wife Krupskaya and ""friend"" Inessa Armand, his domination of the other Bolsheviks, his contempt for the other non-Bolshevik socialists and his single-mindedness and cynicism. For instance, when informed that the shaky Russian democratic regime might pull out of the war unilaterally, he states that he hopes they don't because he intends to the the completely cynical slogan of ""Peace, Land and Bread"" in order to oust the regime and take power for himself. (the Russian people never received any of those three things from the subsequent Communist regime). This is just another manifestation of his infamous comment ""the worse things are, the better they are""...i.e. he was completely indifferent to how much suffering there was as long as it furthered his political goals.
Having said all this, I believe the film fails to show how utterly fanatical and coldly inhuman Lenin really was. I compare this film to the 1970's BBC series ""The Fall of Eagles"" which also covers this incident as well as earlier stages of Lenin's political life. In that one Patrick Stewart portrays Lenin and I feel his performance was superior to that of Ben Kingsley in this one. Stewart and the script he was given more clearly show the despicable, dictatorial side of Lenin (Bertrand Russell once stated that Lenin was the most evil man he ever met) and how Lenin would use people and then chuck them out into the cold when it suited him. He states that there is no morality , there is only ""the revolution"". The people of the USSR would end up paying dearly for the mistake they made when they turned to Lenin and allowed his fanatics to take over Russia and turn it inside out.
Someone  once stated that a fitting punishment for Lenin would be to have him brought back to life and show him what Russia is like today, with all his statues toppled, Leningrad's name erased for the original St Petersburg and how his attempt to restructure human nature in a socialist vein completely failed, with tens of millions killed in a failed attempt to create his imagined Communist utopia.",1452988800,,3141,5.024952015355086
