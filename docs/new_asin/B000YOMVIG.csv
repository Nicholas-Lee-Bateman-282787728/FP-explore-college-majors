8233652,3,B000YOMVIG,"The Mysterious Mr. Wong - Mr. Wong Detective, 1930s film

Stories with an Oriental as the main character were in vogue in the early 20th century. They could be a villain (Fu Manchu) or a clever detective (Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto). The popularity of one or the other tells about popular tastes of the audience. Both Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff (William Henry Pratt) were popular actors in many lower-budget movies. Neither was a top Hollywood star in a big-budget production (but did play character parts, as in ""Ninotchka"").

Poor Bela had a thick accent that limited his roles. Boris Karloff kept working in many movies until his last days. ""Targets"" was his last American movie in 1968 (which included remnants from an earlier horror film). ""Baron Orlok"" was the name from an early horror film ""Nosferatu"". There were a series of films in the late 1930s that features ""Mr. Wong"" until they fell out of favor. Bela appeared in an East Side Kids drama (""Spooks Run Wild"") and an Abbott & Costello comedy (""A&C Meet Frankenstein""). Read the reviews for each movie for more information.",1344729600,,1085,4.827956989247312
8233653,3,B000YOMVIG,"This disc features two different movies with Mr. Wong, in the title.  The Bela Lugosi movie has nothing to do with the Mr. Wong series starring Boris Karloff.  It's a given that neither man was Oriental and, by today's standard's, should not have been playing these characters, but the 30's were a different time and this was common practice back then. I ordered this disc  for ""The Mysterious Mr. Wong"", which has a lot of issues (the hero is an obnoxious racist for one) but it's interesting to see Bela as a Chinese gang lord.  The whole movie is loaded with sterotypes and is strictly low budget nonsense, with a not very good script either.  ""Mr Wong Detective"" is somewhat better; the script and mystery are actually fairly good for this series, and has a good print.  ""Mysterious Mr. Wong is only  ok print.  All in all an interesting double feature but not something special.",1314489600,,883,4.651612903225806
