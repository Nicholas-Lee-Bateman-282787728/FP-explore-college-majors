2310671,5,B0009PS422,"This DVD follows the daily life of Dick Proeneke as he builds his log cabin in the Alaska Bush. Dick takes his time and does an amazing job on the cabin and is a master craftsman in working with wood,making spoons ,door joints, window frames, etc. He lives delibertly in the moment and enjoys life and his manual labor. He is a gentle man who loves nature and is very spiritual without being religeous, to me he is the essence of Zen ,but he probably has no idea what Zen is. Something in this short little series of clips on this DVD,is almost like medicine. Something that we desparately need in this society of fame chasers,greedy sychophants,capitalist consumers, a quiet little message ,powerful and direct. Dick Proeneke got one up on us...",1176681600,8,746,4.659090909090909
2310672,5,B0009PS422,"This is an incredible story that you simply must see if you like the outdoors at all.  This guy is amazing and just knowing he did this makes me feel a little bit more like a city girl!  You have to see this video at minimum, but the book is also interesting and has quite a bit more detail.  My husband has told everyone who will listen about this video and this man's story and has loaned the video out all over town as well!  If you are the least bit interested in the out of doors, you MUST see this!",1170720000,10,504,3.9603960396039604
2310673,5,B0009PS422,This was a gift for my 83 year old uncle who loves nature and walks 4 miles a day and is the healthiest in our family.  He happened to see this show on our public tv station and expressed interest...so what a perfect gift this was for him!  He loves it!,1168560000,4,253,3.9411764705882355
2310674,5,B0009PS422,"As a child, my father used to take us to see wilderness movies. I'm almost certain now that they were Bob Swerer productions, as they captured my heart almost as deeply as Alone in the Wilderness has.

Who hasn't dreamt of living off the land by one's own hands? Dick Prenneke did it, and by filming his odyssey, he's inspired and delighted scores of generations and has shown us the beauty that lies in our own abilities. One can live vicariously through Dick's experience, but one can also learn to appreciate our shrinking natural resources, and perhaps be inspired to preserve it for future naturalists and survivalists.

I've watched this DVD countless times, and it never ceases to amaze, delight and invigorate the spirit.",1162771200,14,729,4.870967741935484
2310675,5,B0009PS422,"We saw about 1/4 of Alone in the Wilderness on PBS and had been searching for the DVD ever since. When we found it on Amazon, we immediately ordered the 2 film package.

It's amazing what one man can do. He built a house out of nothing, but with some tools that he made and his hands.

The scenes of nature are very nice and give you a relaxing feeling.

Overall it was very nice package.",1146268800,21,388,4.078947368421052
2310676,5,B0009PS422,"The first Video has Dick chopping away a new life in the wilderness area of Twin lakes, Alaska.  I can say without a doubt if you have never been to Alaska, this is an easy way to see it.

The area of twin lakes looks a whole lot like many other places in Alaska, but to see it on footage from the 60's was fantastic.  Alaska has pretty much stayed the same since Dick Proenneke's time(the late 60's). Alaska has (outside the cities)stayed the same even as long as I've been here (since 1998) and will stay the same long after I'm gone.

The second DVD shows what the area still looks like today. There was very little follow up with Dick Proenneke and one can only speculate as to why Dick did not want to get fully involved in the second video. I guess after being away from man-kind for so long explains why Dick only wanted to appear in a few short clips. It was nice to see him after the first DVD ended and after all his years Alone in the wilderness. I recommend the 2-DVD set and Bob Swerer productions. Bob did a great job in putting together the first DVD film and filming the second DVD in the remote twin lakes area.

I would have loved to have been there during filming, but the next best thing, is Bob Swerer and Son's 2-DVD set of the twin lakes area, Dick Proenneke and the wildlife.

Thanks Bob Swerer productions I enjoyed the DVD's and I'm looking forward in viewing your other productions.",1138492800,36,1409,4.2781954887218046
2310677,4,B0009PS422,"I especially liked the first dvd with

the scenes shot in the 1960's.

My only regret is there is not enough

material from Dick (only 50 or so minutes)

I mean he did spend 35+ years out there.

Some later solo footage would have been great.

Dick's story is captivating and Bob's narration

fits perfectly with the message.

I enjoyed the recent encounter with

Dick (DVD 2) but again the footage is too short.

The Swerer footage is very nice but lacks the soul

of the material in Disc 1.",1127692800,77,492,4.355555555555555

He is amazing in his ingenuity and ability to live well off the land. It also shows the beauty of Alaska's wilderness very well.

2310685,5,B0009PS422,"Most inspiring outdoor video I have ever watched!  This man was a true outdoors-man and a craftsman.  He walked away from civilization and made a new life on his own and by his own merits and hard work.  What a unique man!  Dick Proenneke wasn't making a TV show, he was simply making a new life.

2310689,5,B0009PS422,"It is incredible to watch how this one man made an entire cabin by hand.

2310695,4,B0009PS422,I wish it were a bit longer! My wife and I watched the dvd's on a rainy Sunday afternoon and found them very relaxing to watch. I would recommend this set to anyone interested in the outdoors and solitude. Well worth the price.,1299542400,,227,4.3023255813953485
2310696,5,B0009PS422,"I didn't buy these movies from Amazon, but nonetheless I do own these two, plus the third of Dick Proenneckes' movies- The Frozen North (narrated by Dick). Alone in the Wilderness is my favorite movie. I have seen it at least 150 times. Amazing to see what one skilled and ambitious craftsman can do. Alaska: Silence and Solitude, doesn't have the same effect on me. I enjoyed watching it, but not in any comparison to Alone in the Wilderness. I would suggest purchasing The Frozen North if you are a fan of Dick, but don't expect too much. He narrates it, which is sorta painful to listen to-his linguistics don't flow well. He has interesting things to say, but the pitch, rhythm and tone do not flow. I don't say this to disrespect Dick, because all I have is respect for him. My dream is to one day see his Cabin. RIP Dick, hopefully you are still in Twin Lakes.",1294963200,,866,4.41875
2310697,5,B0009PS422,"I enjoyed this video and would recommend it to anyone who loves the outdoors.  it not only was beautiful footage of alaska, but  extremely interesting to watch step by step how the log cabin was built and the stone fireplace.  It made me want to go to this place in alaska and see the cabin for myself.  I learned that the place is now a park and you can do just that.  You now can go and visit this cabin for yourself.  A great family video and the book is great too.",1292544000,,468,4.032608695652174
2310698,5,B0009PS422,"If you're shopping for this, you've probably seen the PBS documentary about Dick Proenneke's cabin. Alone in the Wilderness is that documentary. Five Stars for sure.

Silence and Solitude is a second DVD by Bob Swerer, who edited Alone in the Wilderness. It documents a three-week trip into the Alaskan bush to film wildlife and includes two scenes with Proenneke shot in modern times, as well as a montage of recycled cabin-building footage from Alone in the Wilderness. The new footage is nice because it adds a little more context to Proenneke's cabin and personality, and you get to hear his voice. (Bob Swerer did the voiceover of Proenneke's journals for Alone in the Wilderness.) Basically, Silence and Solitude should be a supplementary bonus item on the Alone in the Wilderness DVD. If you're hoping for another documentary about Proenneke, you'll be disappointed, but if you're crazy about Alaska, and if you think you're hungry for every piece of Proenneke that you can get, you'll want to own it. Three Stars.

And if that's you, you'll probably want the book, too. I haven't had time to crack it, but it's a nice item for my shelf, has a nice cover, and the photos are fantastic.

I recommend buying this package and watching Alone in the Wilderness right away. Wait a week, and then come back for Silence and Solitude with minimal expectations, and you won't be disappointed.",1286409600,3,1389,4.852320675105485
2310699,5,B0009PS422,"Words don't exist to explain or describe these videos.  If you have the slightest interest in the outdoors, you have to watch these films.  I've watched them several times and I'm still fascinated at what this man accomplished with so little.  He is a true artist and craftsman.  I wish I had the nerve to take on a similar adventure.",1285372800,,334,4.516666666666667
2310700,5,B0009PS422,A very good DVD. I highly recommend. Would that more of us had his courage and skills. I admire him greatly.,1280361600,,108,4.190476190476191
2310701,5,B0009PS422,"Very few people can do what Dick Proenneke did by walking into the wilderness and staying for 35 years as a totally self-sufficient person. Quite amazing. I wouldn't do it myself, but this documentary is a vision of the kind of men who used to be in America.",1274659200,,258,4.395833333333333
2310702,5,B0009PS422,"The book, ""One Man's Wilderness"" which was a purchase of mine almost two years ago is written documentation of this movie. This is for the people out there that enjoy and immerse themselves in the outdoors. Dick lived as he truly desired and worked hard to make it possible. The peaceful isolation in this film can somehow grab a person and make them believe anything is possible if they seriously desire it.
A man in his fifties heads out to the wilderness of Twin Lakes in Alaska and builds a cabin by hand. The cabin is impressive in my opinion and you get to watch him construct it little by little on this film , ""Alone In The Wilderness.""
This is reality and as far away from the rat race a man can get. If you find yourself  preparing to venture out to the far north like myself then perhaps you too enjoyed the film and it inspired you. The beginning of a persons desires or dreams are only one step away.",1274313600,,913,4.308139534883721
2310703,5,B0009PS422,"The two DVDs were excellent -- hard to imagine that this man lived in the wild (before all the current ""survivor"" type shows on television).  He built his own cabin with rudimentary tools and caught/gathered most of his own food.  He wrote in a journal (before it was ""cool""), and he filmed all his own footage.  The relationship he had with nature should be inspirational to the rest of us.",1272412800,,391,4.557142857142857
2310704,5,B0009PS422,This was probably the best set of video's that I've ever seen on remote alaskan living. I am jealous because Dick Proenneke had the chance to live there and I didn't. Buy these videos you want regret it.,1265760000,,203,4.368421052631579
2310705,4,B0009PS422,"It was great to see an inspirational film about living the simple life.  This film was great at pointing how to enjoy the simple pressures and take in the beauty in all that a person sees.  Written in a folksy way, everyone who has watched this with me is messmerized by the very basic story and way of way as described in the movie.  I bought the DVD to watch and then read the diary - I loved it.",1265587200,2,398,4.012658227848101
2310706,5,B0009PS422,"I watched snippets of this on PBS and knew I'd love it.  I've bought 3 - 1 for myself, one for friends whose daughter build a cabin on their farm, and one for a future gift.  What this man did was amazing. I don't typically like to re-view movies I've seen - this one is different.  I can't imagine growing tired of it.",1262995200,2,319,4.031746031746032
2310707,5,B0009PS422,"I would recommend this to several friends, as well as to my father, and his father, were he still alive.

While it is true that the first film, shot mostly by Dick, is too short, it is also a wonderful addition to the book, and since my wife loved the book, it was great for her to see many of the scenes from it, and to put a face on such an amazing man.  The second film was a little disappointing in that it included several scenes from the first, but I can understand why this was done - if you were to purchase only Silence and Solitude, it fleshes it out more.  Personally, I was hoping for ""outtakes"" from the first movie.

All in all, I give this set a ""thumbs up"" as it is a wonderful and inspirational way to communicate the true nature of life in the outback of Alaska ... and that the ability to get to a place where you have no power lines, roads, mines, or logging to mar the serenity is becoming more rare by the day.

I have yet to read Dick's book, but it is on my nightstand, and I am waiting for the perfect moment to savor the experience.  I'll likely watch his film work again immediately after!",1261958400,,1116,4.0963302752293576

I would recommend this as a gift for the manly men in your life. My 11 year old son finds it a little boring but again I prefer ""relaxing"".
No way I could do what this guy did. While it would be great to get away, I love my family. Also I admit I have only watched Alone not Alaska as of yet. I wish the DVD had a little more content as well but still it's okay. Enjoy!",1260835200,,532,3.889908256880734

I bought Silence and Solitude thinking the focus would be the same as A in the W and was wrong.  I actually felt like Swerer had misled me with his description of this second disk.

Do your self a favor and get Alone in the Wilderness and leave the other one on the shelf.  You will be missing next to nothing.  Spend the other $[...] on the book, One Man's Wilderness, which is basically the book version of A in the W except in print and with a lot more of Dick's thoughts included.

At 39 I have been inspired a number off times to get off my soft side and get somthing done.

His story is so incredible that you would not believe it if it were not captured on film and in his hand-written journals.
