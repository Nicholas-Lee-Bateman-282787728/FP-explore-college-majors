535155,2,6303038697,"THIS TIME, ERNEST [JIM VARNEY] MUST PROTECT A RARE TREASURE. THIS IS NOT A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND IT'S STILL THE ONLY ERNEST MOVIE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A DVD VERSION TO IT. ANYWAY, FANS OF THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM LIKING IT. BUT OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN WASTE THE TIME TO WATCH IT. FOLLOWED BY ERNEST GOES TO SCHOOL.",1093564800,,324,4.508474576271187
535156,5,6303038697,"This is one of the funniest Ernest movies ever made.  In it, Ernest is a university janitor who befriends a history professor with a preposterous idea.  Preposterous that is, until Ernest stumbles upon the physical evidence that proves the professor is right.  But of course, a wily, rich, and ruthless antiquities collector wants the stuff for his own collection.  And the professor has only Ernest to help him save the treasure.
In this movie, Ernest puts academics in their place, quite a few notches below where they think they should be.  If you have any connection to academia, this movie will keep you in stitches- -believe it or not, Ernest really does understand how the inhabitants of the ivory tower think.  Despite appearances, Varney must have been a scholar at some time to meet characters such as these.  The movie starts with the Makita Warriors scene, an all-time Ernest classic.",1026777600,4,896,4.933333333333334

535158,4,6303038697,"This movie has to be the pinnacle of Ernest's movie achievements. It has the perfect combination of Jim Varney's silliness, outrageous situations and great bad guys.
It's also the most likely Ernest movie to be able to appeal to both adults and kids. It's a real showcase for Varney's comic talents.",999561600,4,299,4.882352941176471

7834635,5,6303038697,We have had Ernest movies for thirty years. Our children grew up loving his goofey antics and now our grandchildren are loving him. Somewhere along the way we missed this one. I found it at Amazon and gave it to my husband for father's day. He's an avid Ernest fan. He was so excited he had a come to Grandpa's house for pop corn and a movie. In this day of reality its fun to just sit back and laugh through a good movie.,1345420800,4,422,4.035714285714286
