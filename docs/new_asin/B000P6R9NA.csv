8189346,4,B000P6R9NA,"I enjoy watching Free Style Motocross. I have about a half dozen DVDs on this topic.
This DVD contains various X-Games highlights. I'm really only 'into' Moto-X - I basically did Not watch the rest of this video,  and even with that - some amazing moments. There are quite a few chapters.  It shows Travis Pastrana do his double back-flip and other great moments. Nate Adams and Chuck Courothers(sp?)
The only reasons I did Not give a 5 star is because at times the music is too odd, Some announcers get all off the charts with their hype (need to calm down) One announcer talks in a ghetto way - that does not fit with this. And I have to remember this is a highlight video - I just would like more of Freestyle Moto-X.
I bought it here on Amazon for like a dollar or two and it is worth much more to me.
One rider did a trick where - while the bike is in the air - he lets go and does like a 360 - flat body- roll - Amazing!!
I do Not follow this sport - But I really like this DVD!

8189348,4,B000P6R9NA,"Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan/supporter of the X-games, or those kinds of sports. I know very little about that whole culture---so if you're immersed in that world, this review probably doesn't apply to you. However, if you're the average sports fan, or enjoy seeing some cool tricks (but would never attend an event like a monster truck rally), this could be a DVD for you. The layout of the DVD is great and easy to maneuver though. Very high production value and great footage of the events they're showing--plus they include A LOT of slo-mo replays, which is a huge plus when you're seeing these kinds of tricks. Kid friendly, as well---although I'm sure if it's shown to kids, you'll have some little daredevils on your hands. Who knows, they could be the next X Games stars (if it sticks around that long)!",1239321600,,813,4.652777777777778
