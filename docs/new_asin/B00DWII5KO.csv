5861990,4,B00DWII5KO,"This movie is a bit of low budget finery that pays a tongue-in-cheek homage to the zombie genre. You'll chuckle, laugh, and scratch your head.

It's not humor for humor's sake, though. It's solidly written with believable characters (even if their situation is pretty surreal) that are very enjoyable company.",1374451200,6,309,5.18
5861991,5,B00DWII5KO,"I saw this movie at Phoenix Comicon last year and loved it.  I'm so glad it made it to DVD so I can share it with my friends.  I've ordered a copy and will probably order a few more for friends since it will be the ultimate Christmas gift.  My favorite character is the next door neighbor in his crazy Christmas hat.  I've never even liked zombie movies, but I loved this one.  The premise is that the lead character's wife and neighbors all turn into zombies on Christmas eve and he has spent some time setting things up so he can get by alone in this world.  He is haunted by his promise to his wife to have a good Christmas and decides to do something about it and give her the best Christmas she always wanted.  Along the way he runs into obstacles and meets other living people who aren't always the nicest people and often give him more trouble than the zombies have.  I won't give away the story or the ending, but wow!  It is awesome!",1374451200,8,942,4.188888888888889
5861992,5,B00DWII5KO,"Love Zombie flix, especially with humor. This one has all the ingredients. I was not disappointed. I'll watch it every Christmas to balance It's a Wonderful Life.",1387756800,2,162,5.037037037037037
5861993,1,B00DWII5KO,"I love Joe Lansdale but this film was awful.  Bad acting, poor scripting, no tension and the soundtrack was unbearable.  A dark comedy with no pacing or direction.  And the ""snappers"" were Michael Jackson wannabes without menace.  It's like a family movie made for fun that should have stayed home.",1384992000,3,298,4.9
5861994,5,B00DWII5KO,"Love this Movie!  It has a good storyline with a humorous twist.  Kasey Lansdale, Joe's daughter stars in this movie and does a fantastic performance!  See if you can guess who she is!  This is a must add to your DVD Library!",1382400000,2,225,4.285714285714286
5861995,5,B00DWII5KO,My wife and I agree that this is one of the funniest movies ever. Pop the popcorn and be prepared to be entertained.,1381622400,2,116,4.086956521739131
5861996,4,B00DWII5KO,"I have to admit that I was drawn to ""Christmas with the Dead"" because I lived in Nacogdoches for eight years and know many of the peopel associated with this film.  I am a huge fan to the zombie genre and really enjoyed this film.  Anyone watching a movie like this isn't expecting Oscar quality, so you can't really be too hard on it and might as well sit back and enjoy.",1378684800,2,372,4.152777777777778
5861997,5,B00DWII5KO,Think the zombie theme has been done and overdone ? Think again ! Keith Lansdale's tale delivers a couple of new twists you'll never see coming . Homegrown feel..great characters and lots of laugh out loud moments,1378512000,,213,4.783783783783784

Seriously though- this is a fun movie, do yourself a solid check it out!",1377216000,3,128,4.565217391304348
5861999,5,B00DWII5KO,This was a low-budget zombie movie that delivered. It took a fresh approach to the subject and infused it with some genuine humor. Good fun that goes well with a tub of buttered popcorn.,1377043200,2,186,4.5
5862000,5,B00DWII5KO,"This film was a lot of fun, got loads of laughs out of this....great story, had a Shaun of the Dead ""ZomCom"" kinda feel to it : )  Give it a go, you'll have a grea time!!",1375142400,4,170,3.5945945945945947
5862001,4,B00DWII5KO,A labor of love from some folks who clearly love and respect B movies and horror comedy. Packed with dry  humor and killer Joe Lansdale one liners. I had a blast watching it.,1374796800,6,174,4.2727272727272725
8598774,1,B00DWII5KO,I really wanted this to be better than it was.  Skip this.,1515110400,,58,3.8333333333333335
8598775,1,B00DWII5KO,"Saw this at its premiere and again on DVD. Terrible movie. My family truly enjoys comically bad movies, but this was one they could barely get through. The sound editing is terrible. The writing is painful. The opening title sequence is pretty neat until the weird guy at the end stops and mugs for the camera. That coupled with Brad Maule talking about enviously watching a cat lick its balls are how this otherwise mournful film earned its one and only star.",1451260800,,460,4.621951219512195
8598776,5,B00DWII5KO,So much fun and a great cast!,1449792000,,29,3.2857142857142856

8598779,2,B00DWII5KO,"The Good:
The plot was an excellent concept. Zombie apocalypse takes place on Christmas, therefore the world is stuck on Christmas.

Good one liners! I probably chuckled about 10 times during this film. It's dry humor though, so if you don't like that, avoid!

The Bad:
Poor execution of the plot. Lots of scenes of people standing around, dudes just sitting around. Not a lot happening. The movie was an hour and 20 minutes and it still felt very slow.

The film is very low budget. This probably played into casting considerations. Probably because of lack of funds the casting was poor. These people could not act.

To avoid product placement soup cans, and beer cans were wrapped in copy machine paper. It looked bizarre. Why not just tear all the labels off.

On the acting note: From other reviewers: ""the acting is very good."" I promise you the acting is not. I PROMISE. The lead character is an average actor at best. Everyone else sounds like they're reading their lines for one of the first times. People seemed to be picked off the street at random for their roles.

The scene transitions are pretty choppy. One scene showed two men talking, the next moment they were leaning against a truck drinking a beer!

In Conclusion:
This is a 2.4 star movie. Anyone that rates it over 3 is probably related to the production somehow. I paid $14.99 for this. I would say it's a $4-$5 bargain bin type movie. With a better cast and better script editing  it could have been much more enjoyable.",1418947200,4,1495,4.615094339622641

8598781,5,B00DWII5KO,"I loved it.  If you are one of those people who always watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as a Christmas tradition, consider this one for just you Mom and Dad.  It is touching with a little gore but the gore is not overdone to the point of disgust.  The premise of this movie really touched me.  I don't want to give away the whole story but it is worth buying and adding to your zombie movie collection and bringing it out especially on Christmas.  It is a love story wrapped up in a nice zombie package.  The acting is very good.  Nothing cheesy here.  A keeper.",1394409600,2,559,4.2075471698113205
8598782,5,B00DWII5KO,"christmas with the dead is a wonderful micro-budgeter based on a story by the awesome joe r. lansdale. it seems to be a full on family affair, as his daughter kasey is in it and sings several original, excellent songs, his son keith writes the screenplay, and his wife karen produces. the story concerns calvin's efforts to make this the best christmas ever, despite everyone, his immediate family included, being either dead or undead. and it being june in texas. but the apocalypse came on christmas, so the world is forever stuck on christmas.  this is just one of many nifty additions to zombie lore that this flick offers, that the stae of the world is ""frozen"" whenever the outbreak occurs. when calvin meets up with g.m., a plucky, wise, hysterical garbage man who spends his days killing zombies, the home-spun, philosophical musings that lansdale is known for come into play. the two characters spend time driving around looking for the best decorations, killing zombies, talking about life. this movie is delightful, entertaining, spare, and actually poignant. there is some good gore, but what christmas with the dead has going for it the best is its' sincerity. i strongly recommend this flick; if you must wait till next xmas, go ahead and order it now so you won't forget.",1388102400,6,1286,4.872146118721461
8598783,5,B00DWII5KO,Creepy humor only Lansdale can deliver.  I doubled over laughing through some of it.  If you haven't discovered Joe Lansdale's amazing literature watching this flick might move you towards doing so!,1388102400,4,198,5.354838709677419
