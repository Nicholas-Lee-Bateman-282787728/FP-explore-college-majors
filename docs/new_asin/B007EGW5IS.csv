8515269,3,B007EGW5IS,"Absolutely heartbroken that they added narration to this beautifully animated film. My kids watched when they were little and were mesmerized every time they watched it. I just purchased for my grandchildren, hoping to give them the same gift. Half of the magic of this film was the imagination of the children watching it. The narration has taken that away and, in my opinion, ruined it for a generation desperately in need of the simplicity of the original film.",1514246400,,464,4.886075949367089
8515270,4,B007EGW5IS,"Nooooooo! It has narration! The Bear is absolutely a 5-star animation. The music created the only narration the story needed - it was beautiful and haunting as the story of discovery, friendship, loss and trust unfolded in an enchanting tale. My kids loved it when they were little (and so did I!) so we purchased this as a nostalgia gift for Christmas... not paying enough attention to the description. The narration is well-done, but robs the tale of some of its mystery and enchantment. It is still a wonderful tale with beautiful music and is well worth the investment - it will be quality time with your children or grandchildren and they will remember this story... I just wish they had left it as it was. I took one star off purely for my own personal disappointment... it is still an incredible film.",1482105600,,808,4.6573426573426575

8515275,5,B007EGW5IS,"The simple story, gently told and beautifully animated, is reassuring and nurturing for the child and the child within. We always enjoy Dame Judi, and her narration made this project the perfect treat.",1390780800,,201,5.121212121212121

8515277,1,B007EGW5IS,"People expecting ""The Bear"" to be like it used to be will be very unhappy.  Shame on Amazon for not telling people it isn't the original in BIG BOLD LETTERS.  Narration was added and none of us in my family like it.  Maybe you will like it but it is not for us.",1388016000,12,261,3.8867924528301887
