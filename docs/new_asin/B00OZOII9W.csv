6779772,4,B00OZOII9W,"Good Movie, acting, with familiar stars.  Premises of movie was good I just did not like the way it ended
If you cheat on me, or break my trust and we are in love, it pretty hard for me to forgive you or go back to iyou.  Maybe in time I'll
forgive myself for not seeing it coming or paying more attention to my lovers moves or ways, but I'll never forget that you tried to
set me up, or played me for a game or whatever.

People get killed over less when it comes to feelings, and emotions and trying to ruin someone you are having an affair it. that's dangerous
territory to travel in.

Most would like the ending, but I find it not being able to trust a person again.",1422057600,,670,4.015037593984962
6779773,5,B00OZOII9W,"My Favorite Five -- Hopeless Romantic ""Alive and Very Well"".

Another great movie to add to my romance collection (Watch with an open mind): Love all of  Brian White movies (Christopher) - from the beginning - during and after meeting Rochellle Aytes (Hailey) his character as a true gentleman never changed (awesome sunset scenes). Funny, this movie is fiction (slow-fast-slow-fast pace) but in reality a lot of men and women today that has their hearts ripped apart or broken time after time because of a bad relationship (mind games) rather stay single. And that old saying ""It's a shame you have to date 2-5 people to get the person you want in your life. However, there is that other saying ""One out of a million"" just for you (Spiritual Soul Mate). When some people say their not interested in a meaningful relationship most of the time is because they fallen in love with Mr or Mrs Wrong. Rochelle Aytes (Ms. Conceited Hailey) seem to really want a relationship but she went about it the wrong way (Body Skills) to get what she wanted. ""Karma is a B*TCH -what goes around-comes back around as her mother tried to tell her. Hailey's father mission statement for business (whatever it takes to land a Million Dollar Crop) has red flags from the very start - what father allow their daughter to use her BODY to land deals? Maybe that's one of the reasons why her parents were divorced (Mom *Valarie Pettiford*-Pamela Colburn got tired of her father *Steven Williams* Robert Colburn business BS in the first place). After witnessing first hand how Daddy's little girl handle business (throwing herself at clients -Ho-Kwan Tse-- Mr. Wu-- in a seductive manner to land major accounts - and not a team player with other coworkers); it was time to put a stop too that madness. No matter how many they date at one time (My Favorite Five), sooner or later even Player's can't run from TRUE LOVE with the right person.

This movie is very funny, Quinton Aaron  ""T. I."" (body guard at the club) at the office LOL - - Elimu Nelson, ""Peter"" The Seductive Lover - got slapped around for asking her to marry him LOL. -Amin Joseph ""Matthew"" drop the Millionaire like a hot potato after he filed for Bankruptcy LOL. --- Sexy eyes and crazy-funny man: DeRay Davis, ""Sans"" pool table scene LOL.",1420588800,4,2281,4.6807980049875315
6779774,4,B00OZOII9W,"This was a really wonderful film with some recognizable faces.  Love the production quality behind it, and also the talent behind it as well.  Certainly a film that will speak volumes into certain situations people go through when they thing they know what Love is all about, and yet, know nothing.  Key advice, just wait it out and let it come to you, just like Rochelle Aytes did with her character in this film.  Entertaining, funny, and wonderful.  Great film from Mr. Paul D. Hannah.",1482796800,,488,4.694117647058824

6779789,3,B00OZOII9W,"The movie starts off as a tragedy and pushes the Main Character through the stages of this emotional turmoil, but it seems, probably from marketing department or Finance people, the ending was changed to a Happy Ending and suddenly, the ending movement is squashed into a quick ending that somehow obviously FIXES the huge dilemma of the Main Character.

This movie is an example of someone not putting, but SHOVING, a square peg into a round hole.

The first 90% of the movie showcases the Main Character's flaw and its destructive aftermath, but somehow, the movie refuses to answer the question - how does the Main Character fix the damage she's done?

And the movie's answer is - say that you're sorry, but not SHOW that you're sorry, and then when apologizing doesn't work, seduce to achieve the new bliss, but now we must question, isn't the reason she got into this situation is because she was SEDUCING to win?

So, now the writers are faced with a huge problem, the MC used seduction and got into trouble and now, she's going to use seduction (AGAIN) to get out of trouble?

Doesn't this mean the MC hasn't changed who she is, she just CHANGED UP?

Somehow, this movie has such strong potential and with a few more rewrites, this movie could've been POWERFUL, but alas, I will accept it as-is.

Very powerful moments, deep and personal character conversations, and several gems of TRUTH resonate in this movie and this is SOLID for one of those nights when you want to see something new, just something different.

But again, hats off to the people behind it because it's hard to get a movie made and I look forward to future projects from this team.",1469318400,2,1659,4.638225255972697

6779831,4,B00OZOII9W,"This is a fun, romantic date movie. The main character tries to date several men. She feels that one man cannot possess all of the qualities that she needs. Financial stability, Romance, Sexiness (Good in Bed), Intellect and Strength (Protector) Eventually,she meets an interesting  man and everything gets complicated. This film is funny and romantic. Some of the themes are mature and the film does contain tasteful romantic scenes. The main character has a rather immoral view of dating at first but by the end of the film she learns the true meaning of love. This film would be rated PG-13. No graphic sex, nudity or profanity.
