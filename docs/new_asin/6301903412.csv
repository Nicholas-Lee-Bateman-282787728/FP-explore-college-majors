374910,2,6301903412,"The book Ballet Shoes was a charming novel written nearly seventy years ago that ended up having a wide appeal...certainly, my entire family, children and parents, dancers and non-dancers, could greatly enjoy the tale of three adopted sisters' various paths to stardom and self-fulfillment.  This DVD features a very stuffy, Masterpiece Theater style adaptation of the book that does a terrific job casting the sisters, but otherwise does a rather half-baked job presenting the story, despite having a very long (and it *feels* long) 120 minutes to do the job.
The cinematography, such as it is, largely alternates between static and harshly lit close-ups of various actors emoting, and wide shots of dance and theater rehearsals that are annoyingly cramped and frequently cut off dancers' feet.  The transitions between scenes are abrupt when they exist at all, and the adaptation of the book is particularly clumsy in the way it elaborates on certain areas (the rehearsals leading up to Pauline's and Petrova's first play, for example, and all sorts of backstage drama) while inexplicably omitting other areas that are just as crucial to establishing story and mood (such as the actual theater performances and dance numbers).
The actors on the whole are reasonable given what they have to work with, though apart from the girls, they don't have much of a chance to develop beyond stock types, and the production does them no favors.  A big part of the book's charm was its combination of real-world mood (early twentieth century London locations and the dress and customs of the period) and a distinct fairy-tale like quality (three girls named Fossil with big dreams and their great-Uncle Matthew aka ""Gum"")...my daughters were truly taken with the book.  The video establishes some old world detail, but the fairy tale quality seems mostly lost in the bare bones production, so anyone who's not familiar with the book will not only be lost (given all the weird ommissions and non-existent transitions), but wonder what the fuss is about.
The DVD *is* mildly enjoyable as a companion to the book, but by the second hour, it moves at an increasingly glacial pace, and by the end, my girls were wondering when it was going to end. I would still recommend (with qualifications) this disc if you are a big fan of the book, as there are some very enjoyable scenes which may replay your favorite parts....this is somewhat akin to acquiring a bootleg tape of your favorite band's concert, complete with bad sound and drunken interludes.  Keep your expectations very low, though...and if you haven't read the book, make that a priority instead!",1072915200,20,2640,5.018264840182648
374911,1,6301903412,"You would expect some dancing in a ballet title, but there is none in this title. This is just a silly movie about some girls that wants to learn ballet. This DVD is definitely in the wrong category. It is a childrens movie not a ballet movie.",975801600,26,243,4.191489361702128
7816400,4,6301903412,"I read the book as a child, then later purchased a copy for my daughter.
Previous reviews suggested this as the best film adaptation of the book.
It's good, but not great.
The flow is sometimes lacking, scenes choppy, and the monologues of the ballet mistress a bit long
and over done. One such discourse would have been okay, but there are several.
Miss Sylvia (Garny) is too insipid - she's portrayed as dimwitted at best and outright dumb at worst.
The children however are portrayed very realistically (warts and all) and nicely acted.
Parts of the film are very charming - it's worth watching.",1501891200,,598,4.704761904761905
7816401,4,6301903412,"This is the earlier film version of Ballet Shoes. I had seen the newer film first with Emma Watson with more modern film techniques and slightly faster pace, so at first this piece seemed a little bland, but then I was able to separate the two versions and appreciate it for its own sake. This version remains more true to the book, I feel.

As for characters and actors, I've read the book and I don't remember Sylvia being quite so flighty and unable to make decisions. Other than that, I liked all of the characters and thought the child actors did very well in their parts.  I did like 2007 version of Posy's character, which was more spirited and bold--the 1975 version of Posy is much more sweet and pretty much faultless, though the actress pulls it off pretty well.",1370131200,3,773,4.475177304964539
7816402,4,6301903412,"Ballet Shoes is a film based on the book by Noel Streatfeild, which I loved as a child (and still do!) I was disappointed by the 2007 movie with Emma Watson in which the girls are too old for the parts, the acting mediocre and the dancing (what was seen of it) terrible, a real pity in a movie based around ballet.

This older version of the film was made in 1975 and in my opinion is a much truer tribute to Streatfeild's classic novel. While the style is old-fashioned with long explanatory dialogues not really seen in movies nowadays, the parts are all portrayed with honesty and innocence. I especially enjoyed the performance of Mary Morris as Madame Fidolia, the classical Russian ballet teacher that features in all ballet stories of the era, played just as I feel Streatfield would have intended.

The three children, Pauline, Petrova and Posy were all played by dancers which I was so thankful to see (one of the biggest problems with the 2007 movie was the atrocious dancing!) and though none of their performances was particulary remarkable they fitted the parts well and played a very realistic believable family right down to the day-to-day life of bickering, loyalty and trying to make ends meet.

I would recommend reading the book before watching this movie as parts are somewhat obscure if you haven't read the book - and it is one of the films truest to its novel I have ever seen. I would have liked to see more dancing, we see some class and rehersal scenes but never get to see the performances the girls are working up to, a bit of an anticlimax!

A very sweet tribute to Noel Streatfield's work.",1336348800,5,1619,4.591695501730104

7816407,2,6301903412,I loved this program when it ran on PBS in the 1980s.  This DVD is incomplete.  It is missing about a half an hour of the original material that was shown at that time.  I would love to have a DVD of the COMPLETE version of this program but I am very disappointed in this shortened version.,1107734400,24,290,4.052631578947368
7816408,5,6301903412,"This is an inspiring BBC-TV kids tale where a hard-working guardian takes care of three sisters, trying to provide a nurturing environment

This  was first  shown  in  1975 and I remember seeing it when it first  aired  on PBS  and ,I was really  hooked watching the  3 sisters as they  went thru  their problems  and had some good times along with  the bad but  how in the end they  got what  they  wished and dreamed for. This is a great sentimental  story and is a story  that  you will enjoy!",1102377600,9,496,4.288888888888889
7816409,3,6301903412,"As a child, I really loved the book on which ""Ballet Shoes"" was based; the story of three orphan girls who grew up to be dance & theatre stars thrilled me.  But this BBC version of the story put me to sleep:  the charmingly eccentric members of the Fossils' household are overplayed and campy, and the whole thing is rather claustrophic: with very little in the way of actual dancing (perhaps they were on a limited budget), virtually the whole thing takes place in various drawing rooms at a glacial pace, losing the vigor, wit, and energy of the books - and limiting its appeal to children rather severely.  My dance-obsessed daughter watched for a few minutes, puttered around with her toys, then wandered off.

However, if you were a fan of the books, you will probably still want to give it a look.",1093219200,8,803,4.555555555555555
