8120861,5,B000FD3AV8,"The debut entry in this series is still the best, even if the video quality and sound are the weakest. It is the most realistic, with some of the best acting from the young women. It almost seems like a couple of these sessions might be real.

The segment with the beautiful busty bespectacled business woman Amanda (pictured) especially feels natural. Her nearly 15 minute entry is the longest and best of all 36 women in the five volume ""franchise."" Aurianna, a bubbly and innocent 18 y.o. SoCal blond with a pretty face and peachy ripe rump is another series top highlight. Gorgeous future Penthouse Pet from the UK Martina Cosgrove and dubious college girl Natalie are also good, but not ""Best of"" material. The other three girls come off like professional strippers and phony.

This is a review of the 67 minute digital version. The Amazon listing says the DVD is 55 minutes. I don't know if that is correct or not.",1526169600,,920,4.638036809815951
8120862,3,B000FD3AV8,"Sexy and entertaining, but I'd bet my last dollar this is all staged and these ""everyday"" girls approached to get naked for money are all professional, or at least semi-professional, models, dancers, and the like. Their acting skills leave something to be desired as they try to feign shyness and embarrassment. The nudity is full, but no ""gynecological views"" presented and the girls just dance around a bit while nude, so this is actually ""R"" stuff that falls just short of ""NC-17.""",1500508800,,484,4.914634146341464
8120863,4,B000FD3AV8,all of them are really good movies. the ones that are factory sealed are in excellent condition. and even the ones that are not sealed up looks to be in near perfect condition.,1435363200,,176,4.363636363636363
8120864,1,B000FD3AV8,"I was expecting that these would be normal women, housewives or whatever, who would get naked for money.  That's not the case.  These women are strippers on their day off.  You can tell by the meticulously manicured pubic hair and the standard cutesy dance moves they all do, the exact moves of strippers on stage.  Sad.",1380240000,2,320,4.660714285714286
8120865,1,B000FD3AV8,"You've got to be kidding me! I don't know where the other two reviewers were coming from but I have a very different take on this. I have some good news but mostly bad news. Let's start with the good news.

Fortunately, all the participants in this production are very attractive women. They have pretty faces and gorgeous bodies. There's no question they're very nice to look at. Having said that, it's the only positive side to this product as far as I'm concerned.

Now for the bad news: IT'S ALL FAKE! This is evident from the moment the ""camera crew"" approaches each of the girls to recruit them for the project. From the way they react and behave on camera it's obvious that they are not random people approached at shopping malls, parking lots or college campuses as you are made to believe, but are actors and very bad ones at that. In my opinion the whole situation is staged, scripted and rehearsed - nothing spontaneous at all. The product synopsis hails this as the ""ultimate reality video."" Believe me there's nothing real about it. So if you're expecting something along the lines of Girls Gone Wild... forget it!

Lastly, if you were to pay attention to the product itself and the packaging it comes in you will realize that the video is presented on a DVD-R disc and the insert appears to be produced on an ink jet printer on regular copy paper. Definitely not a commercially manufactured product.

I have no problem keeping this video because it's amusing and entertaining after all despite my observations, but I would certainly not spend any more money on any of the later volumes.",1288915200,9,1600,4.6431095406360425
8120866,5,B000FD3AV8,"The picture quality is pretty good, as it kinda has to be with this kind of production; otherwise, what would be the point?

Seven young ladies dance, some well, others after a fashion, in front of the camera completely devoid of clothing. There are no gynecological or medical close-ups but if you like to look at naked women, this video will probably work for you.",1225843200,13,366,4.630769230769231
8120867,4,B000FD3AV8,"The idea for this DVD is so brilliant that you wonder ""why hasn't anyone thought of this before?"" (Or maybe they have, only I missed it.) A camera crew walks up to a beautiful young woman who happens to be walking around in that area, and they ask her to come to their studio for a modelling job. And when she gets there and stands in front of a camera, they tell her: ""I'll pay you a hundred dollars to get naked"".
Of course she refuses, but then they say ""I'll pay you two hundred dollars to get naked"". And the price goes up and up, sometimes to a few thousand, until she agrees. She then drops all (yes, all) her clothes and dances in front of the camera for a while. And after 7 girls have done this, the DVD is ready. A simple idea just writes itself.
The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that most of these girls don't look very natural in shaving terms. Had this been done in the 1980's it would probably have been better for me. But if you don't have a problem with this, then enjoy.
I just hope these girls don't have too much regrets afterwards, when their new money has been spent.",1204329600,20,1101,4.125581395348838
