8522419,5,B007W56I2A,"Two words: unholy sideshow.  This is a circus of cool, weird, and completely messed up stuff.  There's a lot of gore, and some humor...and then some more gore.  It's fast paced and not once was I bored!",1370390400,,202,4.405405405405405
8522420,5,B007W56I2A,"This movie is great for so many reasons.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, there are all kinds of great ""what the hell?!"" moments (body mutilation, lots of blood...you have to be into gore for this one), even the undead.  It's a great mishmash of what I like about horror movies.  Love it.",1368316800,,294,4.509433962264151

8522422,4,B007W56I2A,"If you're one of those people that is scared of clowns, this movie probably isn't for you. However, if you love Rob Zombie movies and stuff like that, then this will be right up your alley. Lots of blood, gore, and sideshow mayhem. What more could I ask for? heh heh",1361145600,,266,4.235294117647059
8522423,3,B007W56I2A,"So,There are Karlos Borloff/Rob Zombie -ish chracter, A Cleve Hall clone ,SCREECH(S.b.t.b.) as a clown and The Enigma !

If you're a fan of carnivals,sideshows and well mayhem on the midway;You might enjoy this romp of a drunken fit.

Lots of GORE- Beheadings,Stabbing, Entrails pulling,Lots of `SAW' Movie pastiche.

The plot: The Freakshow minions have to do these sacrifices to keep the zombies from conquering the world and well,There is your plot...Drink while watching,Drink alot !",1343174400,,487,5.381578947368421
8522424,3,B007W56I2A,"If the Three Stooges teamed up with Benny Hill and Red Skelton to make a horror movie, this might be it.  The performers at this freak show have a great time, the audience in the bleachers not so much.  But it's after the audience has left that the real fun begins.  That's when the freaks conjure up the power of the darkness.  This involves buckets of blood and an abundance of body piercing (made me look away).  The story, as far as I could tell, involves a battle between two underground forces, one of which unleashes the dead, who rise up as zombies.  As a movie, this thing is a mess, as great fun, it's great fun.",1341878400,3,622,4.273504273504273
