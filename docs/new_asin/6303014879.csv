535020,3,6303014879,"Until a couple of years ago, if you couldn't catch a Peanuts cartoon/special on TV or pick up a Peanuts treasury from the library, then you were out of luck. But now, classic Peanuts material is much easier to find. One such classic -- well, CLASSICS, rather -- is this video, which contains He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown from 1968 and It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown from 1983.
He's Your Dog is about everyone complaining to Charlie Brown about Snoopy's lack of obedience, and Flashbeagle is loosely based on Flashdance (which came out earlier that same year) with Snoopy playing the lead character. Both specials are good -- actually, the latter is GREAT -- but there are some other points I would like to cover.
To understand why I gave this video a 3-1/2-star rating, let me go into more detail about the specials. As I said before, He's Your Dog is about Snoopy's lack of obedience. He even causes problems to Charlie Brown, because he insists on walking Snoopy on a leash, and Snoopy behaves as though he can't breathe -- or that Charlie Brown's grip is too strong on him, I'm not sure which. Anyway, Charlie Brown sends Snoopy to stay with Peppermint Patty for a while to learn some discipline, which Patty briefly explains to Roy.
Actually, that's another thing I've always wondered about. What exactly is the deal with Roy? He always just happened to appear around Peppermint Patty, and I'm not sure if he lived with her, or if SHE lived with HIM, or what. And why was he always wearing that hat from camp?
Anyway, back to the movie. After a while it looks as though Snoopy is well-mannered, but when Charlie Brown comes to pick him up, he makes the mistake of bringing the leash with him, which causes Snoopy to literally tear up the leash. Okay, Snoopy can tear up a leash with his bare hands, yet he is unable to get out of the leash when Charlie Brown is walking him?
Flashbeagle has more of a party theme, as the kids are all at a party (I'm not exactly sure whose party it WAS, though) and they get into games (""Lucy Says"", like Simon Says) and dance routines (Charlie Brown's ""The Pigpen Hoedown"") and such. The only thing really wrong with this special was that the animation was kind of lazy. If more than one person was in any shot, you'll notice that the person talking was usually the only person moving -- nobody else was even blinking. Maybe United Feature Syndicate didn't want to shell out too much money and instead just stuck still frames in.
Finally, I don't understand why these two videos are packaged together because their respective themes aren't even remotely related (and don't say they're both about Snoopy; you know that's not what I mean). But this is still decent enough to pick up if you want to relive some nice Peanuts memories.

535022,4,6303014879,"We own several of the Peanuts Double Feature videos, and this one is our kids' favorite.
The first program, ""He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown"" is one of the earliest Peanuts specials and is my favorite of  the two episodes on the tape. Snoopy's initial, ornery mischief-making is  quite humorous, and his eventual taming by Peppermint Patty is a nice  lesson in responsibility and gratitude. It's classic Schultz that many  parents(like me) will find both nostalgic and funny.
The second,  ""It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown!,"" seems dated to me in certain  respects (particularly the disco theme), but is far and away the kids'  (ages 6 and 3) favorite. Flashbeagle is the most musical of all the Peanuts  special outings, with a number of catchy, character-specific songs that  never fail to get our daughters up and dancing (our 3-year-old now sings  along with ""Listen to Lucy"").
This is a solid Peanuts tape  worth having in your kids' video library.",960940800,10,949,5.019230769230769

7834567,1,6303014879,"I bought one of these thingys for around $60 which seemed fair for a snoopy movie but it won't even fit in my DVD player! At first glance, the huge rectangular piece of plastic looked too big for the slot, but at $60 I was determined to make it work. But no matter how hard I pressed, it wouldn't go in. Then I noticed, looking through the window that this kind of DVD comes all wound up on a little spool inside the rectangle. Took me a while to figure out the spring-loaded door but I managed to pull out some of this ""DVD tape"" and feed it into my DVD player. Still no picture. Now the seller won't take it back because it's ""damaged"". Well who's gonna fix the damage to my DVD player? Huh? Never buying from those crooks again!",1308009600,,731,4.154929577464789
7834568,4,6303014879,"I've been a Snoopy fan literally all my life, and I don't imagine that it will ever change.
""He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown"" - an enjoyable tale about Snoopy being sent back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for a little refresher course in obedience, which he instead turns into a vacation at Peppermint Patty's house, though after Charlie Brown attempts to take him home, and he refuses, Patty turns the tables on him, and puts him to work, until Snoopy learns a lesson (of sorts). - This is one of the older productions from the Snoopy specials, as evidenced by the artwork which is similar to the Charlie Brown Christmas special.  I had a vinyl kid's record of this when I was real young (No, I'm not THAT old! CD's were just beginning to come out at the time!), and seeing it brings very fond memories.

""It's Flash Beagle, Charlie Brown"" has been, and remains to this day, one of my TOP favorites out of all the specials! I was in the first grade when it aired on TV, and I loved dancing along with the musical numbers at the time. However, the reason I'm only rating this video at 4 stars, instead of 5, is because of what Paramount did to this when processing it for sale - during the original TV airing of this episode, during Snoopy's dance scenes, there were a lot of cool music video visual fx, such as freeze-framing Snoopy into 5 pix in the corners, pixellating Snoopy in the schoolroom scene in time to the lyrics, and spinning the picture around really fast as he danced. But for reasons that I canNOT for the life of me figure out, Paramount REMOVED them! WHY?!  Those FX were so appropriate for the era that Flash Beagle was made, and Paramount's removal of them hurts the episode's impact.

I'm glad to finally have these two episodes in my collection, but Paramount's sabotage of one of my top favorite episodes hurt the enjoyment a fair amount.

If they ever get smart and do what the books companies are doing with the Peanuts strips, they'll release the Peanuts specials all in a single (or a few) set(s)and RESTORE that original version of Flash Beagle!",1199664000,,2070,4.49468085106383

As for He's your dog, it's ok, very weak 1/2 peanuts special.  More important, it's still entertaining!!",1141084800,,247,4.444444444444445

7834571,5,6303014879,"You've GOT to own this video, just to have the ""Flashbeagle"" episode, if nothing else.  ""He's your Dog..."" is a good flick, but without a doubt, ""Flashbeagle"" will make you forget about it, because it ROCKS---literally!  All the song's from ""Pepperment Patty's PE Program"" to ""Lucy Says"" and of course the title song give this Peanuts episode all the makings of the 80's MTV/music video craze (which was the big thing when this episode first aired).  I'm 26 now, and I remember it when it was first out--and when I see it, it just takes me back--it's awesome!  It's a delight for all ages!  I highly recommend it.",1112054400,4,613,4.638888888888889
7834572,3,6303014879,"On one hand, ""He's Your Dog Charlie Brown"" is interesting and somewhat amusing as the tale of Snoopy behaving badly and having to stay with Peppermint Patty. This tale somewhat foreshadows the film ""Snoopy Come Home."" On the other hand I guess you have to really be a kid to enjoy ""Flash beagle."" I was in my twenties when I saw it and thought it was WAY too corny. Must be my age.",1086825600,4,381,4.232876712328767
