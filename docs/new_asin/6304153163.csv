7866187,5,6304153163,"Portrait in Black is a sort of film Noir that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Lana Turner is a powerhouse as Sheila. An unhappy wife married to an overbearing controlling and manipulative husband (Lloyd Nolan). Lonely for attention, she seeks the love from her husbands Dr (Anthony Quinn). Soon desire and passion gets the beat of them and they find themselves plotting the death of Lana's husband.  A great story with edge and twist. A truly entertaining story with a great cast.",1490227200,3,487,4.867469879518072

7866189,5,6304153163,"I've just watched this film again and find it so much better than ""Imitation"".
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Douglas Sirk's glossy color dramas, but he also directed some others like ""All that Heaven allows"", ""Never say Goodbye"" (which he co-directed with Jerry Hopper) and even ""Magnificent Obsession"" (the 50's version, please) that I think are a lot better than the highly over-rated ""Imitation of Life"".

""Portrait in Black"" reminds me of some of Hitchcock's best works like ""Vertigo"", ""Marnie"" and ""North by Northwest"". It's from Michael Gordon who directed some very good flicks like ""Woman in Hiding"" (Ida Lupino, one of the best film noirs) and ""Pillow Talk"" (Doris Day and Rock Hudson...it doesn't get any better than this).
It's not only the good plot that I enjoy when I watch ""Portrait in Black"", it's also the gorgeous San Francisco movie locations and Frank Skinner's score.",1401926400,,895,4.927152317880795
7866190,5,6304153163,"Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn play excellent roles as lovers, only Turner has a problem; she is already married to a demanding, mean spirited and controlling tycoon dying from a terminal illness.... but for Turner and Quinn, he is not dying fast enough.  Quinn plays the physician caring for Turners dying husband.  Turner, desperate to get out of her marriage and be with Quinn, is faced with a suspecting step daughter, Sandra Dee, and an arrogant ""wanna be her lover"" Richard Basehart;  who present problems for Turner and Quinn after pulling off the perfect murder of her husband.  Just as they think they've gotten away with the murder, threatening letters start appearing in the mail claiming to have witnessed the murder, putting more stress on Quinn and Turners affair, leading them to recklessly search, find, and kill the person sending the letters.  The suspense builds to unsuspecting twists and turns, and at the end, leaves the viewer reeling but satisfied.",1399248000,3,971,5.04375
7866191,5,6304153163,"Super campy PORTRAIT IN BLACK is, in a nutshell, about a married woman (Turner, of course) who loves too much a celibate doc (the ever intense Anthony Quinn) who's really not that into her but more into himself.  Indeed, the guy's a complete narcissistic douchebag.  Who in their right mind would off a man, then another, then almost kill a young woman (goodie two-shoes Sandra Dee) just for the sake of owning hysterical, co-dependent but always great-looking, even in a crisis, Turner.  Pretty delusional if you ask this reviewer.  But that's exactly what connoisseur of ultra glam movies Ross Hunter wants us to believe in his over the top production number penned by original ""Charlie's Angels"" co-creator Ivan Goff and directed by PILLOW TALK fame Michael Gordon.  Yes siree, what those people behind PORTRAIT IN BLACK wish most is to captivate us with such fast speeding plot and lacquered situations that even bad movie experts like yours truly will overlook (or feel stunned by) the sheer stupidity of it all (nice try, though).  But the best part in watching this impressive fiasco is witnessing la Turner completely losing it.  When she's not overacting while nervously pushing back her curls, she's being slapped, hair pulled, thrown across the room and even reflection-shattered by a thrown candlestick in a mirror, all done by her entourage of men, no less.  And if that's not enough, her hilarious attempt at driving a car without a permit is the tip of the celluloid iceberg.  Everything from a blackout to a sudden thunderstorm to cops showing up occur in this overlong scene.  That, plus a Turner fit of all fits in front a precipice makes PORTRAIT IN BLACK a definite must in bad cinema magic.-----Martin Boucher",1300752000,2,1730,4.93448275862069

Don't try to buy any of the plot just enjoy the lush production values.

7866193,4,6304153163,"In Lana Turner, producer Ross Hunter found the ideal leading lady for a series of florid, lush melodramas, beginning in 1959 with ""Imitation of Life"", the movie which re-ignited Turner's waning box office appeal.  The following year, Hunter reunited Turner with her ""Imitation"" daughter Sandra Dee for the murder mystery PORTRAIT IN BLACK.  Costumed by Jean Louis and surrounded by a stunning cast including Anthony Quinn, Richard Basehart and Anna May Wong, it was clear that Lana was back on-form and relishing her second wind.

In PORTRAIT IN BLACK (based on a 1947 play by Ivan Goff), Turner plays Sheila, the second wife of ruthless, embittered shipping tycoon Matthew Cabot (Lloyd Nolan).  Matt is dying, and the death can't come soon enough for Sheila, who has grown weary of Matt's blazing temper and suspicious mind.  Unbeknownst to the rest of the household, Sheila is carrying on an affair with Dr. David Rivera (Anthony Quinn) - who'se also eager for the old codger to fall off the twig - so he administers a lethal concoction in lieu of Matt's daily injection...  The deed goes off without a hitch, until a few days later when Sheila receives a hand-printed letter, congratulating the widow on the ""success of her murder"".  Sheila and David's lovelife slowly unravels as the pair attempts to track a mysterious blackmailer whilst the body-count rises...

With a slight nod to Lana Turner's film noir masterpiece ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", PORTRAIT IN BLACK is a gorgeously-filmed mystery thriller which had me riveted right to the end.  Sandra Dee co-stars as Sheila's stepdaughter Cathy, with John Saxon as her boyfriend.  Richard Basehart, Ray Walston and Anna May Wong (making a brief return to movies after a ten-year absence) are marvelous.  Ross Hunter favourite Virginia Grey has a small but very well-written role as Cabot's secretary.",1256601600,,1863,5.075409836065574
7866194,4,6304153163,"I'm a big Lana Turner fan, and recently watched this movie for the first time in years.  Very melodramatic, the clothes are gorgeous, Lana's makeup is flawless even when she is in the middle of murder.  Almost campy, but not a bad movie if you have a couple of hours to waste on the weekend.",1057881600,,291,4.2727272727272725
7866195,3,6304153163,"A faithless wife(Lana Turner) conspires with her lover(Anthony Quinn) to murder her wealthy husband(Lloyd Nolan). The dastardly duo carry out the dirty deed well enough for the unsuspecting hubby is most assuredly dead; however, after the dearly departed's funeral, someone starts to blackmail them. The premise of this suspense melodrama is rather ordinary, but it is given a considerable lift by splendid decor and an agreeable cast. It's slickly produced by the distinguished Ross Hunter who worked with star Lana Turner a year before on the classic soaper IMITATION OF LIFE. Empty-headed, yet irresistable Hollywood entertainment.",972864000,15,634,5.614583333333333
