6105010,3,B00GRZPR5K,Disappointed it did not show more scenery like other railroad CD's I've bought.,1457049600,,79,5.153846153846154
6105011,3,B00GRZPR5K,"it was a gift, so don't know.",1456358400,,29,3.2857142857142856
6105012,5,B00GRZPR5K,"This set is great for railfans. 11 hours of film of railroads from around the world, showing lots of different types of rail traffic.

However, I have some sympathy with those who thought this was going to be films devoted to train trips. A more accurate title would simply have been 'Railroads Around The World'. There is no sense of being on a journey or journeys, just film of trains running in various locations. Sometimes there is lovely scenery, sometimes there isn't, but all the time the trains themselves are the focus, not the experience of the traveler. The commentary, too, is devoted almost entirely to the running of the railroads rather than the passengers' perspective and is actually, even for me, a little intrusive.

I'm a railroad junkie and for me this set was exactly what I wanted, hence the 5 stars. For casual viewers wanting films about rail trips with the focus on exotic locations, this might not be the best choice.",1453680000,6,944,4.75
6105013,5,B00GRZPR5K,Interesting,1435363200,,11,11.0
6105014,5,B00GRZPR5K,"This DVD is aimed solidly at rail-fans, but it has enough beautiful scenery that everyone can enjoy it. The emphasis is on how the railroads fit into the local economy and conditions, and how they get used. It's pretty much a travel guide for those who are interested in rail transport. Alas, I am unlikely to make any personal journeys on any of these lines, but I still enjoy seeing them.",1434067200,3,390,4.507042253521127
6105015,5,B00GRZPR5K,Gift for my husband. He watched the Switzerland episode over a over. Guess where we go next!!,1433376000,,93,4.529411764705882
6105016,3,B00GRZPR5K,"Would have liked it more if they would not talk about the actual train itself, and showed more scenery of the sights of Europe. But overall it would be a hit to the person who is interested in the education of how the trains run and the different models of the trains.",1426291200,3,268,4.173076923076923
6105017,4,B00GRZPR5K,"My husband and I enjoyed this video. It is a very good documentary on the railroad systems of France, Belgium, Germany, and the Mediterranean Islands showing the complexity of Europe's railroad system. The scenes include beautiful scenery and the railway yards. Anyone who enjoys trains and travel would like this video.",1421020800,,320,5.294117647058823
6105018,2,B00GRZPR5K,"I expected beautiful scenery, and there was some, but mostly train mechanical workings and gray color tones all about.
Probably good if you are a railroad engineer.",1419984000,4,164,5.111111111111111

8626510,5,B00GRZPR5K,I already had a copy so gave it to a friend who also likes trains. thank you,1526601600,,76,3.5294117647058822
8626511,3,B00GRZPR5K,This is not the travel log I was expecting.  It goes into detail about the train itself.,1519862400,,88,4.176470588235294
8626512,2,B00GRZPR5K,"I enjoyed the segment about Switzerland the best. The Swiss landscapes were lovely. Based on the title, i
was expecting the focus was on passenger trains. There was a lot of obsession about
 locomotion types and how trains carrying freight kept highways from being overrun with lorries or as we say in the States, trucks. Much more technical than expected, not enough about the experience.",1516233600,,389,4.984615384615385
8626513,5,B00GRZPR5K,great as I love trans,1515369600,,21,3.4
8626514,2,B00GRZPR5K,"I thought this would be more scenic but it presents much of the freight and working trains in the different places.
I was looking for something like Chris Tarrant Extreme Railroad Journeys, I was wrong.",1503273600,,202,4.8
8626515,5,B00GRZPR5K,Hours & hours of trains and great scenery from many different countries.  Well narrated with good audio.,1502323200,,104,5.117647058823529
8626516,1,B00GRZPR5K,I was expecting to see visions from the train and the inside rooms and diner and such. This was just pictures of train yards around the world. False title to me and I returned it.,1485475200,,179,4.142857142857143
8626517,1,B00GRZPR5K,"Not at all what I expected and feel the title and blurb are deceiving. We kept waiting for it to ""start"". DO NOT buy this if you are looking for journeys through beautiful scenery...it's nothing but a history of the railroad system in each country. This was a gift from my husband and he is so disappointed.",1476230400,2,307,4.4035087719298245
8626518,1,B00GRZPR5K,Very old and dated  video of extremely poor quality.,1460073600,5,52,4.777777777777778
