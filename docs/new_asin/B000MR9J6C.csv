8218318,2,B000MR9J6C,"When I got this DVD delivered in the mail I immediately put it in the DVD-player. I was eager to hear and see this ""living blues drumming legend"". At the first notes I could not believe my eyes and (especially) my ears. Good grief!! What in the name of all the drummergods was this??? Some joker with his home-video equipment on a tripod somewhere in a basement? The sound of his drumkit is absolutely horrible, due to bad recording equipment (I think honestly that this is recorded with only just some camcorder in a basement). Then the sound of him talking is also bad, it sounds hollow, also because of bad recording equipment. And the mixture of them both is even worse: drumsound is much louder than the speaking. So I found myself constantly ajusting the sound volume up and down, depending whether he was drumming or talking. And what to do when he does both at the same time? Cover your ears.
Apart from this I must say that Dave Russell seems like a nice guy and he has things to say that are certainly worth listening to, although mostly interesting for starting drummers. And if you are looking for a 'play along'DVD, this one is not so bad, because he plays complete songs. The man is absolutely not a bad drummer and there may well be enough musicians that want to play with him, or bands that want to have him as their drummer. But he's not of a level to make a drum-DVD and in overal the technical quality of this DVD is bad, no other word for it; far below the other drum-DVD's that one can buy. If you are a starting drummer and can 'score' this one for 5-8  dollars you can do it. But every dollar more is a waste, better spent on other DVD's.",1224547200,3,1661,4.340836012861736
