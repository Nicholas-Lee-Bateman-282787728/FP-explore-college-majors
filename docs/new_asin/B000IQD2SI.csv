2662816,5,B000IQD2SI,This is truly a fantastic video of traditional gospel music.  The interviews with the recording artists is wonderful and takes you back to some great memories.  This is music that should be preserved.  A must for any country music fan.  Have bought several and will continue to buy.,1356393600,3,282,4.8125
2662817,5,B000IQD2SI,"I grew up listening to these same singers and writers (plus some others not on this list). (I'm 81 now and still love the older country songs and gospel music). It is really nice to listen to the songs, but it is so much greater to watch the artists sing these songs and tell their stories. This set of DVD's is fantastic and well worth the money. Also, it is great to hear these Christian singers and song writers witness about Jesus Christ and what He has done for them. The story of Billy Walker witnessing to Red Foley about two hours before he died was a real blessing, and I'm sure because of that praying together Red Foley is with Jesus and GOD in Heaven. A lot of these singers from this set of DVD's have gone on to meet the Lord since the original taping. I know a lot of us really miss them.
If you are familiar with these artists, I highly recommend this set.",1297468800,17,872,4.196428571428571
2662818,5,B000IQD2SI,"This is an awesome DVD. If you like the old fashion gospel singing, you will truly enjoy this.  I saw this at a friends and knew I had to have it and searched for it for a while.  The price is way below what it is truly worth. Just hearing the singers tell of their experiences in life makes it worth buying.",1255564800,13,308,3.9516129032258065
