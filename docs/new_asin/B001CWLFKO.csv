8290271,5,B001CWLFKO,An inside look at Brit Humor on the construction site...very very funny...I watched this series a couple of years ago when staying in Northern England and just had to have it...unfortunately it wasn't available and still isn't in my Region format...so I had to get a no region player first...got that and now the AWP series...as I said this is situation comedy on the construction site...great for becoming exposed to regional accents...I might also suggest 'Only Fools And Horses' also.,1389571200,,487,5.1
