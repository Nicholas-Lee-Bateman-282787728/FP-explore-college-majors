692397,4,6303575358,Eddie Murphy is one of the Most Important Actors in Hollywood over the last 30 years Period. His Genius&Wit are a trip.but as time has gone on he has been Imitated by so many&he has fallen Victim too Formula. The  First B-Cop was a Gem&a Hit Formula for many Comedians of Today too  Follow.but sadly Eddie Murphy got caught up into the trap as well.the 2nd  one had moments a little better than Average.the last one was Horrible. I  Hope He Doesn't make another. Eddie wasn't funny in the last one.the first  one is the best far&away of the three.the 2nd one has moments check out  a Younger Chris Rock. The Last one was Really Bad.only a Couple of Good  Moments but very Forgettable. Still You Can't Deny The Depth&Genius Of  Eddie Murphy A True Powerhouse. His Influence is Huge.,961200000,,781,4.5285714285714285

692712,2,6303575358,"Love these movies, however the quality of these are no better than a DVD at best.  I have the 1960 Magnificent Seven on Blue-ray, and the quality is exactly the same.  I would expect a movie that was filmed twenty-four years later to have far better quality, but it does not.  BHC is at least as grainy and un-crisp as the 1960 movie where they didn't have the technology they did in 1984!  Save some money and get the DVD version, you won't feel so disappointed that you bought a Blue-ray, expecting that level of quality, and received one but with DVD or worse quality.
Not worth the money in my opinion, and I would NOT recommend this Blue-ray set.",1508025600,4,651,4.4

693524,5,6303575358,murphy in his early carrier as a actor he made me laugh all the way threw bc1 from the opening seen to the end. the story line is awesome to axel(murphy) on the track of a killer who took the life of his best friend. two gun shoots to the head. yuck. the opening seen was funny axel in the back of the truck hanging on for dear life in a cop chase. skipping ahead to the rosewood and taggert  waiting outside the hotel of axel who orders room service for them .then sneaks up behind the car sticking a banana up the tail pipe so they cannot follow him when he leaves with his good friend jenny. that cracks me up. the hotel axel paying the man in charge a visit while he is lunching with his right hand man axel stick his hand in a ice jar asking the waiter. what year is this waiter reply's 73. whipping the water over his face axel reply's yes it is. other things that are great is the police chief who know axel is a loose cannon but trust him totally and the Beverly hill chief of police who to comes to trust him .the friendship with rosewood and taggert unfolds with piss takes and crazy deeds but it leads into bh2 and so on murphy is just so funny. great at this role. if you are a fan of this guy you will well and truly love this series its also to be taken a little series if you can get past the axel funny's 12 out of ten from me It cracks me up and the music is so 80s great to here,1453420800,2,1396,3.915492957746479

693708,5,6303575358,"All the Beverly Hills Cop movies together.

The first two are the best but even the third one had sparks of the irreverence that was Axel Foley.  Apparently Detroit violence is deadly serious but Beverly HIlls violence has a bit of sarcasm and witty showmanship to its violence. Beverly Hills Cop (the original) was the one making me an Eddie Murphy fan. Up until that point I'd only had glimpses of him on SNL and really didn't care for his brand of humor.

This is a good buy for when you feel like an Eddie Murphy-athon.",1428105600,,523,4.427083333333333

694119,2,6303575358,"There are 3 Beverly Hills Cop films included in this 3-disc multi-region Blu-ray set. This collection has almost 2 hours of bonus content ported over from the previous DVD collection (2007). Don't expect a deluxe release because the supplements are good but not great and ignore the third film. It is missing a 3-hour retrospective documentary about the franchise as a whole. It is likewise devoid of audio commentaries and sports a single deleted scene. The video and audio are average and should be remastered. This collection is not overflowing with treasures but is a good purchase for fans. Beverly Hills Cop gets as much love from studios as Robocop (and that's not saying much). I rate the films 4 stars and this product gets 2 stars. It is somewhat pricey if you only want the original (the BD set has to be imported) but rare so it has managed to hold its value. Check the specs for compatibility in the US.

Special Features:
Disc 1: 47 minutes of extras. Cast and crew interviews, location map, music featurette, casting documentary, photo gallery and theatrical trailer.
Disc 2: Cast & crew interviews, deleted scene. ""Shakedown"" music session special, behind the scenes featurette and the requisite theatrical trailer.
Disc 3: Cast & crew interviews and theatrical trailer.

Beverly Hills Cop is about a Detroit detective investigating his friend's murder in Beverly Hills.
Beverly Hills Cop 2 features the same cast solving a mystery with a visit to the Playboy Mansion.
Beverly Hills Cop 3 is about an amusement park with some shady elements. There is no Taggart, Bogomil, Jeffrey, Harold Faltermeyer or Bruckheimer/Simpson.",1377388800,3,1639,5.044280442804428

694537,4,6303575358,"Bevery Hills Cop is honestly in some ways the perfect evaulation of Eddie Murphy's career.  The first Beverly Hills Cop is early Eddie Murphy in that it's mostly comedy based so Eddie's comedy keeps the movie entertaining while the storyline was well written with various stories surrounding Axel Foley being told (getting revenge for his friend, earning the trust of the Billy & Bogamil & Tagard)...just a classic movie here.  The second movie is my personal favorite & shows Eddie in a more diverse role as this one is not only funny but also filled with more action than the previous movie with so many funny moments such as him stealing the house & at the Playboy mansion.  While the first two movies were classic, the third one displays the current direction of Eddie's career in that this third movie was a big complete disappointment & huge downfall from the first two.  Right from the start, only Axel & Billy return in this one with them bring back Serge from the first movie for a minor role, the story had plotholes, and all the humor along with drama & action just didn't mix well here...like Foley's Detroit Chief being killed off but expecting us to laugh right afterwards unlike how the shootings were in the first two movies that set the right mood & I just thought the acting was bad with Thersa Randle (Axel's love interest) & besides the part with Axel trying to rescue the kids from the malfunctioning ride, the action was really lackluster & wasn't any point where you thought ""he's really in trouble now.""  In the end, the first two movies were classics while the third one was just a bad installment of the now trilogy to the point where Eddie himself admitted it years later.  However, it's going to be cheaper to get all three of these movies together than buying them seperately or getting that ""complete line up"" boxset so I recommend.",1216425600,8,1862,4.644376899696049

694685,5,6303575358,"First off, let me just say how sick and tired I am of people saying that Eddie Murphy is no longer funny! This man has continuosly re-invented himself, taking on risky projects when most stars of his stature stick with the same old formulas that they began their careers with (Tom Cruise in ""MI-3""? What's the difference between THIS and ""Top Gun"" 20 years ago?!)Eddie Murphy was crucified for ""Harlem Nights"", ""Vampire in Brooklyn"", ""Life"", ""Metro"" et al. So much so that people overlooked his comedic genius in films such as ""Coming to America"", and the two ""Nutty Proffesor"" movies. Come on, not even Mike Meyers can play an ENTIRE family! And now Mr. Murphy is going to bring a new character to film lore, playing pompadoured manager James Early in the winter release, ""Dreamgirls"". And lets not forget that he is the highest grossing alum of Saturday Night Live...ever. Yes, besting even the great Adam Sandler. Thank you all for letting me rant. Now for my review:

The summer of 1984 saw some great releases: Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Gremlins and Beverly Hills Cop. Actually Beverly Hills Cop wasn't released until the WINTER of '84, but when it was it quickly became a hit, even outgrossing Harrison Ford's second outing as Indy. Beverly Hills Cop is a movie of firsts: The first movie with a black lead to surpass the $100 million mark (it eventually grossed $186 million making it the highest grossing comedy of all time until ""Home Alone"" surpassed it in ""90). The first action movie by legendary action producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. The first time that audiences were exposed to the genius of Bronson Pinchot. It is also, along with ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"", one of the most quotable comedies ever. How many times have you heard the ""banana-in-the-tail-pipe"" line? Or the ""herpes symplex 10"" gag? Or the part where Murphy sneaks into Victor Maitlin's warehouse and improvises an entire scene pretending that he's an inspector? Classic. For those of you who don't know, this movie was originally written as a vehicle for Sly Stallone, but due to contract negotiations breaking down, the part went to Murphy who was hot off his success with ""48hrs."" and ""Trading Places"". It would be extremelly difficult to imagine another actor as Axel Foley.

Beverly Hills Cop II: This was the next feature for Simpson & Bruckheimer after the phenomenal success of ""Top Gun"". It was also their second collaboration with director Tony Scott(Top

Gun). Murphy's career was soaring. The result: A fun, fast, funny, loud, sexy ride! I was 10 years old when this movie came out, and it was the first R-rated movie I was allowed to see. I remember seeing it on a Saturday afternoon with a packed house and not being able to hear much of the dialogue because of the roars of laughter. Nineteen years later it still holds up. This movie pretty much set the standard for action movies of the '90's. Don't the ""Bad Boys"" movies, ""Armeggedon"" and ""Face-Off"" remind you of BHC II? When you watch this movie you see such joy in Murphy's performance, along with Judge Reinhold, and John Aston. You want to jump in the screen and join in on their fun! I haven't seen such interplay between three comedic leads (and they're ALL comedic roles)since the Marx Brothers. Tony Scott interjects his high-action concepts well into the film, making for one grand comedy-action film.

Beverly Hills Cop III: This movie alone is the ONLY problem I have with Mr. Murphy's career choices. How can you invent a character who is so fun. So full of life. So ribald. Carry that character for two movies, then turn him into a sleep-walking drip by the third installment? I watched these three films back-to-back-to-back one weekend and was astonished and appaled by the transformation Axel Foley went from BHC II to BHC III. I remember when BHC III was being made and all of the drama surrounding it. Murphy demanding (and getting) an astronmical fee. The epic fights he and director John Landis engaged in on-set. Endless script problems. And for what? THIS!? The two previous flicks I told you what was RIGHT with them, this one I will tell you what's WRONG with it. First off: What happened to the Marx Brothers effect? Part of what made the first two films successful was the interplay between Foley, Taggert and Rosewood. This one has Taggert completely removed and Billy (Rosewood) is confined to a DESK for most of the film. The villain is someone you don't love to hate (remember how evil Victor Maitlin was, or how clever Brigitte Nielson and Jurgen Prochnow were), heck he doesn't even REGISTER! Where was the profanity laced back-and-forth between Murphy and his Chief that we got addicted to in the first films? Where is Murphy's sidekick Jeffrey (Paul Reiser)? None of these missing elements makes for a fun sequel. Apparently the script problems remained just that... a problem. And to top it all off: Murphy isn't even having any fun. With every tossed off line, or half-hearted attempt at being funny, Murphy shows us clealrly that he's here just for the money. The horror, the horror. This one came out in '94 and the '90's weren't kind to Mr. Murphy. I feel that he was doing a lot of growing and experimenting as an artist during this time, but he had this chance (along with Nutty Proffesor later) to remind us of the greatness he once, and still does, have.",1151193600,7,5402,4.786709539121115

This might be assuming too much, but I believe people will be reading reviews of movies they have seen and would like to purchase.

I have two main issues with some box sets.  Some companies like to use a cardboard or heavy paper case to house each DVD in a box set.  These cases are also used for individual DVDs by some, but they are not as sturdy as the plastic cases.  The other issue is about the bonus material or edition.  Many box sets are simply a grouping of movies in a series that are placed in a box.  Some box sets are not comprised of special editions of the movies, and some don't even have any special material.

694689,4,6303575358,"Beverly Hills Cop is a timeless classic.

By having a pretty good plot, light humor and some originality here and there, this film has become a well-deserved classic. So obviously it was made before Eddie Murphy's ego got the better of him and before he sold himself out to family audiences.

Eddie plays the brilliantly named Axel Foley, a fast-talking renegade Detroit cop. After blundering a cigarette truck set up he travels to Beverly Hills in his crappy, sky-blue, banged up Chevy Nova to solve the murder of his best friend. Very much out of place, he has to solve this mystery on his own as the 'by the book' Beverly Hills Cops don't take him seriously.

There is no macho crap here. No love interest and no other sleazy junk you find in most cop thrillers. By sticking to what it wants to do (walking thru the plot making jokes) it succeeds as a comedy and a thriller. Harold Faltermyer's 80's music doesn't date the film one tiny little bit. 5/5

Beverly Hills Cop II is my fave.

Up to scratch in all areas apart from the editing. I'll get to that later. This one sees Axel head back to Beverly Hills after a 3-year gap to solve the Alphabet crimes. The film is more violent than the original and is truer to the Simpson/Bruckhiemer films that followed.

When you compare this movie to more recent flicks like Con Air or Man on Fire or Black Hawk Down you can see a definite resemblance in style. These movies have very fast editing to heighten the action. Obviously the editors practised on this movie as the editing is very bad and there are many continuity mistakes.

It doesn't retread the same ground either. The first summed up what Beverly Hills was like in the early 80's but this one shows us the world indulgent Americans live in when they have more money than they can spend. As Axel says 'These rich people loose their minds and want to live in a donut', when describing to a building foreman that there are not supposed to be any right angles in the house he is about to 'steal'. The music has improved a bit too. Even if some of it is a direct rip-off of the music in John Carpenter's Escape From New York. It's a shame the music (not songs) from these films is not available on soundtrack.

Give Beverly Hills Cop 2 a chance and don't listen to the narrow-minded critics who panned this film (18 years ago). 5/5

Beverly Hills Cop III is a disgrace.

And a monumental flop. Beverly Hills Cop 3 spent so much money and delivered practically nothing. We get a 1.85:1 screen, bland production design (in a theme park?) and out of place action on the rides. It should have had a wider screen and more eye-pleasing backgrounds if it wants to look good on screen. But it never happened. The tone is very different to the previous 2 films and has some totally pointless action and a weak plot.

Ronny Cox, John Ashton, Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckhiemer and Harold Faltermyer all bailed out of this film. Surely the director should have seen that as a sign. There isn't even a reason for Ronny Cox not being in this movie. At least they bothered to explain why John Ashton couldn't be bothered showing up (apparently his character retired to Arizona to play golf). Judge Reinhold is wasted and is given NO funny lines. Eddie Murphy acts like he's in a Die Hard movie and how the other characters can't figure out who the bad guy is just by looking at him is insulting to the audience's attention.

Millions of dollars were spent on this movie that came traipsing in 10 years after the original and 7 years after the sequel. I guess no one cared about Axel Foley anymore. As I have already said...the film bombed big time.

Bizarre Trivia: Sylvester Stallone was originally set to play Axel Foley in the first film but the script (that he wrote) was radically different and strongly resembled the script for Cobra, which he made a few years later. But Cobra (starring Beverly Hills Cop II actress Brigette Neilson) was apparantly based upon a novel by author Paula Gosling called Fair Game. This novel was later made into a movie of the same name (bearing absolutely NO resemblence to Cobra) and starring Beverly Hills Cop actor Steven Berkoff as the villain. A poster for Cobra also features in Beverly Hills Cop II.

694690,5,6303575358,"All three ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies are great movies with lots of action and comedy. I have been a fan of Eddie Murphy for a long time, and Murphy does a great job at both action and comedy. Here is a rundown of every film:

""Beverly Hills Cop"" is about a Detroit cop named Axel Foley (Murphy) who receives a visit from his best friend Mikey Tandino(James Russo)who lives in California. However, once Tandino arrives in Detroit, he is murdered, and Foley flys to Beverly Hills to track down Tandino's killers.

In ""Beverly Hills Cop II"", Foley is watching the news when he discovers that his boss and best friend Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) has been shot. And after Bogmoil is shot, Foley teams up with cops Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold)and John Taggart(John Ashton) to solve a series of robberies that are known as the Alphabet Robberies.

And in ""Beverly Hills Cop III"", Foley discovers that the men who killed his boss are operating Wonder World in Los Angeles- and then goes undercover to catch the bad guys.

I enjoyed all three ""Beverly Hills Cop"" films. All three were good, but my favorite was the second, as I found it to be the most interesting out of all three films.

Mumber 2 and 3 are classics in my opinon, with loads of action, and lots of funny bits, but I don't know if everybody will enjoy the first one as much. Usually the original movie is the best, but this time I think it's the worst. It has a completely boring story-line (Eddie Murphy wants to avenge the death of his friend, so he goes to Beverly hills to stop them) we've all seen this story-line before. Also, there isn't as much action that you'd expect to be. The only action is really the first five minutes and the last ten. Only worth getting the first one for the comedy, but not for action fans. Now, the last two have loads of action, aswell as comedy. My favourite would have to be the third, 'cause I like the area it's set in, Wonder world (amusement park). The second is more like the first, but with a better story-line, action and comedy.

694737,5,6303575358,"Eddie Murphy gives us not one, not two, but three of the funniest and finest performances ever in his career that is ""Beverly Hills Cop""! Here are my comments on the following three films:
""Beverly Hills Cop"":
This is the film, to me, that made Eddie Murphy a star. To the filmmakers, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was a milestone in motion picture filmmaking. ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was also the highest grossing film of 1984. Martin Brest (""Scent of a Woman"", ""Meet Joe Black"") directed this first installment with lots of action, and laughs, laughs, laughs from start to finish! ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was also one of the earlier Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer projects before ""Top Gun"" and other big budget hits. This first film in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" legacy focuses on Axel Foley (Murphy), a street smart Detroit cop who goes to Beverly Hills, CA to investigate a murder of one of his old friends back in Detroit. The prime suspect is an art gallery magnate named Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff, ""Fair Game""). But his street smart Detroit training does not blend in with the somewhat strict Beverly Hills police training as Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox, ""RoboCop"") send in Detectives Billy Rosewood and John Taggart (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton in hilarious performances). During his investigation, Axel meets up with another old friend, Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher, ""An Officer and A Gentleman"") and her assistant Serge (Bronson Pinchot in an outrageous performance). During the film, Axel learns that he and Rosewood and Taggart must team up in order to take down the ones responsible for his friend's death. And the film goes on from there. The DVD special collector's edition of this first film includes cast and crew interviews, trailer, and more! Also, when watching ""Beverly Hills Cop"", watch for Paul Reiser as a Detroit cop and Damon Wayans as a Beverly Hills hotel fruit salesman.
""Beverly Hills Cop II"":
After the worldwide success of the first film, the filmmakers decided to set ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" into 3 years later after the events of the first part. This time, the director is Tony Scott (""Spy Game"", ""Enemy of the State""). To me, it was sort of different than the first one because you do not get as much hilarious action like the first one, but that doesn't make the second film a bad one. This second installment follows Axel Foley (Murphy) still up to his old tricks. But this time, he goes out once again into the glamorous world of Beverly Hills as he teams up once again with Rosewood (Reinhold) and Taggart (Ashton) to solve the attempted murder of his friend, Capt. Bogomil (Cox). The prime suspects are Maxwell Dent (Jurgen Prochnow, ""The Replacement Killers"") and Karla Fry (Brigette Nielsen, ""Cobra""). The DVD version of this includes one deleted scene, cast and crew interviews, ""Shakedown"" music featurette, and trailer. When watching ""Cop II"", watch out for a young Chris Rock as a valet at...Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion and also watch out for the man himself!
""Beverly Hills Cop III"":
This time, the director is John Landis (""The Blues Brothers"", ""Animal House""), in which he directed this with lots of energy and style. To me, I like watching ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" much better than I did the second one, but even this third installment cannot beat the first one! Simpson and Bruckheimer are not involved in producing this one this time. And also, to me, ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" is almost in the same comedic spirit as the first one, but still has the exciting action of the first two. This third, and sadly, last installment takes place in Detroit, as Axel Foley (Murphy) and a few other cops lead a raid that goes horribly wrong. The raid also resulted in the death of his longtime friend, Chief Inspector Todd (Gil Hill from the first two films). The evidence points to Wonder World, a theme park in Southern CA. Axel once again teams with Rosewood (Reinhold) this time. Joining them is Detective Jon Flint (Hector Elizondo). The prime suspects in Axel's boss' death include Wonder World's chief of security Ellis DeWald (Timothy Carhart) and his henchmen (including John Saxon, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""). Also, Axel once again meets up with Serge (Bronson Pinchot), who has made quite a business with himself in selling home defense systems and such. The DVD version of this just includes the trailer and the cast and crew interviews.
In conclusion, I love watching all three ""Beverly Hills Cop"" film simply because they all have the same two main characters, Axel Foley and Billy Rosewood, in all three films. Paramount has certainly picked the right time to put out all thre ""Cop"" movies on DVD! And to me, basically there will never be another franchise quite like the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies...unless you're watching all 4 ""Lethal Weapon"" films.",1018483200,11,4798,4.881127450980392

All 3 of these movies are great. Eddie murphy really comes off nicely in all of them. The beverly Hills cop series really is the preeminent titles when it comes to the comedy-action-cop movie.  The first movie is excellent, and the second is just as good, and maybe even better. The 3rd movie falls a bit short of the first 2 but is still great, and of course is very funny. How could you not laugh when murphy tries to fire ""the annihilator 3000"" only to have it start playing rap music. And who doesnt love that classic laugh.

Beverly Hills cop 2 - Another easy 5 Stars
Beverly Hills Cop 3 - 4-5 stars
If you haven't seen these movies and like a good action comedy... go rent them now!!! You are depriving yourself of a great laugh and a fun and entertaining time.
That said....
Im tired of seeing DVD's in only widescreen format and not standard. many of us LIKE movies to be reformatted for our TVs and HATE letter box format. Yet DVD seems to ignore this and release the vast majority of its titles in widescreen ONLY. I've seen some discs that have both formats on one 2 sided disc - this is great, but even just having a standard ""alternative"" version out would be MUCH APRECIATED!!! As an e-tailer I know Amazon has no control over what is available but perhaps they could make more of an effort to get titles in stadard format when possible and perhaps we could all try and speak up to pressure the movie studios to address this issue.
Im beginning to think about just forgetting about DVDs and going back to my VCR. Then I didn't have to worry about 4:3 aspect ratio or peering into the details page to see if I was going to have to stare at those two big black boxes for the whole movie. I cant be the only one that this annoys!!!! I understand why some people love WS, but please.... give us a choice.",1015113600,9,2058,4.25

694740,5,6303575358,"Arguably Eddie Murphy's best and most successful film, Beverly Hills Cop redefined the ""Police Cop"" genre by introducing a new element not seen before: humor, which is interspersed throughout the film, perfectly blending with the action & drama...in fact now it's become the milestone of what all other movies of its kind strive for.  As far as casting is concerned, many people are under the impression that Hollywood intentionally cast Murphy in the lead role as Axel Foley and then surrounded him with white actors to cater to a more global market.  This is untrue.  Originally, Sylvester Stallone was cast as Axel Foley, who wanted to turn the film into something more to his liking (see ""Cobra""), but due to budgetary constraints, the studio was unable to afford the costs to do this.  So, with just two weeks until shooting began, Stallone stepped down graciously and then Eddie was hired.  All other cast members had already been hired and signed to do the picture, thinking they'd be working with Stallone, so when the lead switch was made, it gave the impression of this all white society with one lowly black man thrown in the mix.  It just so happened that this was exactly what the film needed as well as Murphy's unabashedly raw comic timing to become the huge hit that it became.  Eddie's Axel Foley is the quintessential cop you can laugh at and take seriously at the same time, and he makes it look so easy.  Director Martin Brest, who decided to do the film on the fate of a coin toss, was the perfect person for the job.  With Eddie, he gave the film a perfect sense of timing, pace, plot, story & character development that innercut beautifully with each other.  But having Eddie there was like icing on the cake.  If a scene was dragging or seemed dull, Eddie would throw in something extra that would liven things up.  His comedy feels fresh because it's improvisational, done right there on the spot with hardly ever the same joke given twice for each take.  Judge Reinhold's Det. Billy Rosewood and John Ashton's Sgt. John Taggart make for the perfect costar comic duo whose funny scenes with one another came from their own original testing together for the parts.  Both Detroit & Beverly Hills are given their own look as well, with a considerable amount of difference to be sure.  The film even has wonderful small parts by some now very famous people, such as Bronson Pinchot (Serge), Damon Wayans (Fruit Seller) & Paul Reiser (Jeffrey Friedman).  Plus the music for the film hits all the marks, including ""The Heat is On"" by Glen Fry, which opens the film and gets an audience all revved up in anticipation, & of course the ""Axel F. Theme"" by Harold Faltermeyer which became so popular, even though it's an instrumental, that it can still be heard on the radio to this day.  Now at last, Beverly Hills Cop, along with its two sequels are available on DVD with some nice added special features including cast & crew interviews (although Eddie himself participates very little in these), featurettes, an audio commentary by Director Martin Brest for the first film that's pretty insightful, theatrical trailers and even some hinting at a Beverly Hills Cop IV, which wouldn't be such a bad idea if they could get a decent script and director.  Beverly Hills Cop II was a solid sequel, directed by Tony Scott (of Top Gun fame) that retained much of the original's humor and charm but was made more like an action piece (which is Tony Scott's forte).  Beverly Hills Cop III is a different story.  Directed by John Landis who directed Eddie Murphy in the far superior Trading Places, part III pales in comparison to it's predecessors for many reasons.  The mix of humor, action & drama is done all wrong.  When Foley's Chief is killed at the beginning, he then chases after the culprits in a stolen sports car with an airbag that pops out into his face that's supposed to make us laugh, but it's not the time for laughter (see the original film for the correct way to do this, with the death of Axel's friend Mikey).  Plot holes abound as well as the lack of John Ashton's Sgt. Taggart, who wanted to do the movie but had to bow out due to schedule problems.  Some scenes in the film make you cringe, but what can you expect when the script was written by Steven E. DeSouza, who also wrote and directed the disappointing Street Fighter.  You'll also have the annoying ""Wonderworld"" song stuck in your head hours after the movie's over.  But as bad as it is, it's still viewable to the point where it's corniness becomes funny (so bad it's good type deal).  I love it anyway.  The only real downside to getting this lovely box set is the price.  Paramount still wants to gouge the consumer.  If you want a comparison just look at the Dirty Harry DVD Collection.  It costs nearly the same retail but has two more films than this set does.  So get the set on sale while you can.  Even if you're a fan of the first two films, getting all three together is cheaper in the long run.
