3715181,4,B001GVJYV8,"This is another one of those obscure, brilliant movies and great performances, that nobody has ever heard of. Set in war torn eastern Europe in the troubles of the 80's, it is a story of a zoo keeper (Sam Niell )whose deep love for the animals locked up in a zoo, who are in mortal danger from stray bombs, mortars, hungry soldiers, etc, make him stay behind and fend for the animals as best he can. He is alone in his endeavours, until a young boy, followed by his mother dressed as a man (for obvious reasons in war time) seek refuge in ""his"" zoo. At first aggressive, he softens to their presence, and gets the boy involved with the animals, while the woman sets up house in the zookeepers tiny hut. To tell the rest of the story would spoil it, but there is no fairy-tale ending. An excellent, virtually solo performance by Niell, this is a very well made film, with a good story line and a very plausible plot. Something different in a story line and well worth the money.",1362441600,2,977,4.344262295081967
3715182,4,B001GVJYV8,"THE ZOOKEEPER was released in 2001 and is just now becoming available On Demand and in DVD.  It is a harrowing, harshly realistic story both well written - by Matthew Bishop and writer/director Ralph Ziman - atmospherically captured by cinematographer Piotr Kukla, scored with intensity by Nikolaj Egelund - and acted with great skill by Sam Neill and his costars. It is a difficult story to share but one that is so well created that it deserves very wide exposure.

The story takes place in the present somewhere in Eastern Europe. Jonah Ludovic (Sam Neill) is a man living alone whose life as an ex-communist is bordered by his simple existence of writing strangely gentle and eloquent poetry in his journal, and maintaining his meager existence by being the Zookeeper at the municipal zoo. On this morning he hears the beginnings of a civil war: the sounds of gunfire and shelling and glimpses of fire startle him and he runs through the checkpoints to his zoo.  At the zoo gates he encounters all of the workers running away to safety, leaving only Ludovic and the zoo's veterinarian (Om Puri) to care for the caged animals.  Ludovic elects to stay at the zoo despite warning from the local warlord Yeltsov (Marek Vasut) and Dragov (Ulrich Thomsen), the vile sociopathic captain in charge of searching the for deserters and malcontents.  Ludovic gathers his courage and states that the zoo is off limits to everyone, keeping his zoo as a sanctuary for his animals.

But out of the terrifying burning of the village comes a young boy Zioig (Javor Loznica) who seeks shelter.  Ludovic at first refuses outsiders but eventually allows Zioig shelter, seeing that the boy loves animals. Together they feed the animals their rations and care for the sick ones.  Zioig finds his mother, the newly widowed Anika (Gina McKee) who is disguised as a man to prevent being abused by the troops.  There are similarities between Anika and Ludovic and they and the boy bond.  Anika discovers Ludovic's journals and sees that this isolated, time bruised man is gentle  at heart and as they begin to find each other the war explodes and the zoo is burned and all are left with how to cope with the destructive disaster of war.  Can one survive without relinquishing principles and caring for living beings? The audience is left to make that decision.

Sam Neill does a masterful job creating a lonely man whose life has been inalterably changed before the story begins and allows us to see the transformation or softening of a victim of a war torn country.  Gina McKee gives her finest performance to date and the acting of Om Puri, Ulrich Thomsen and Javor Loznica is exemplary.  This is a very powerful film, one that deserves wide attention - especially now....  Grady Harp, September 11",1316995200,13,2777,4.802521008403361

8326487,4,B001GVJYV8,"This movie was well-acted, and most likely historically accurate, but be warned - it is kind of depressing. Set in a zoo in the Balkans, during a time of civil war between 3 different factions, Sam Neill volunteers to stay behind and be the caretaker of the animals at a zoo, after everyone else has been evacuated. Not a warm-fuzzy type of movie, it reminds me of a quote from a Swedish movie about an imminent start to WWIII: War teaches us nothing!""",1437523200,,452,4.457831325301205

8326489,4,B001GVJYV8,I have not seen this movie yet but plan to do so.  I have a question-is this story related at all to the book The Zookeepers Wife which my book group is currently reading ??  It sounds very familiar.  In fact I looked up movies to see if that book had been made into a movie as it seems a natural for filming.  It had not been done as a film but then I read about this movie with similar themes.,1404864000,,395,3.8395061728395063

8326491,5,B001GVJYV8,"I was downright stunned by this dose of World War II-style excitement in one thoroughly engrossing package. The Zookeeper features one of my favorite actors, Sam Neill who finds himself in charge of a zoo in the midst of wartime somewhere in Eastern Europe while all his cohorts flee. Neill gives a browbeaten performance, his sullen demeanor conveying the shell-shocked, anguished, lowly zoo employee. He is a consistently good actor, and he doesn't disappoint here. Neill does his best in the face of dwindling resources to keep the zoo in tact, a difficult proposition considering that partisan bands will occasionally raid the zoo looking for meat stock, and things only get worse when a boy and his mother enter his life, making things more difficult-and yet, better-for him. Now he must not only fight to save the animals, but also the humans, suddenly in his care. All three characters see hope in the zoo - as long as the animals are okay they will be too. This is a story that stayed with me for several days after watching. The Zookeeper is incredible, yet thoroughly authentic, emotional drama with brilliant portrayals all around. The plot is deep and rich, with some surprise laughs, and plenty of shocks. The mix of all this is a beautiful, compelling film all its own.",1366848000,,1283,4.836363636363636
