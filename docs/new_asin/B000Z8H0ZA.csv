8235062,5,B000Z8H0ZA,I bought this to watch with my mother since her and I used to watch this when I was younger. As good as it used to be. Just good clean humor. If you haven't seen this and you can understand the Spanish language I would highly recommend picking this up.,1390348800,,252,4.06
8235063,5,B000Z8H0ZA,"El Chespirito (name of the actor), who does el ""Chapulin Colorado"", is a Mexican comedian who does a variety of characters, it's easy to look up the rest of his characters on google.  For the role of ""El Chapulin Colorado"", he is a super hero of a different ability.  He isn't Spiderman, Superman, Batman, etc.  No, ""el Chapulin Colorado"" is a bumbling super hero that gets the job done in a nicely comedic way.  Extremely family oriented.  Highly recommend.",1363392000,,458,4.746835443037975
