130439,5,0792146344,"I Can't wait to get this video! What's cool is it also includes ""Cooking with Susie"" and my favorite episode of all time, ""And the Winner is!"" Where Angelica wants her to lose over a trip to Cynthia Land, and Susie even tap dances to our National Anthem, without the tap shoes, but still tries anyway. Watch the entire video for yourself, whether you celebrats Kwanzaa or not.",999043200,3,376,4.544117647058823
130440,5,0792146344,"This is an excellent video that introduces young ones to the basic meaning of Chanukah, and I would recomend it to anyone who's interested. It combines the basic story of Chanukah, with the humor that the Rugrats  provide.
The video does have some flaws. It's recorded in the fastest  mode (apparently to save cost, but to be honest, I would have paid a few  bucks more for a better quality recording) so the quality is not the  greatest. Also, the closed captioning  for the hearing impaired has lots of  errors, such as some Yiddish expressions, and at the end when the blessing  is given, it just says ""(speaking Hebrew)"" where the TV version  spells it out and suffers from none of the above-mentioned flaws.)
Still,  it is not enough to change my rating of 5 stars, or my recommendation of  this video, as the content of the video is, of course, the most important  part.",944870400,12,876,4.587096774193548
130441,5,0792146344,"We found this to be an informative video for our children and entertaining to us as well. It explains Chanukah to children in a way they can understand when they are coming from another cultural background. The story  is clear, easy to understand and follow, and entertains at the same time.  It also shows the need for understanding, tollerance and the  acepting of  others different from ourselves in the world today. As a parent, I  apprciate holsom videos that teach a lesson as well.",944092800,7,488,4.761904761904762
130442,5,0792146344,"Here is some info: In ""Monster in the Garage"", something is knocking things down, and Stu thinks it's Spike. But it's not, and Tommy thinks it's a monster. What is it? In ""Touchdown Tommy"", the  Rugrats are having a fight against Angelica for a bottle of chocolate milk.  Whatever the kids do with the bottle the football players do with the ball.  In ""Let there be Light"", the electricity goes out and Tommy  thinks that the light went away. In ""The Inside Story"", the  Rugrats go inside Chuckie to find a seed that Chuckie swallowed. But can  they get it out of Chuckie before Angelica makes it grow? Well, that's all  the shows on the tape. Hope ya enjoy it!",917827200,9,661,4.458333333333333

The story, however, was based too much about the turkey and not enough about the truth regarding the sacrifices of the believers who were looking for a place to worship The God of Israel, Maker of the heavens and the earth, and Yeshua, The Savior of the world.",1385596800,,317,4.482758620689655

130575,5,0792146344,"The video does give a brief background of the history of History. ( e.g. Kwanzaa was created in 1966).  I think kids will enjoy hearing the names of the symbols of Kiswahili.  There are some inadequacies that existed in the presentation.  For example, Aunt Susie says that Harbi gani means how are you in Kiswahili, but actually it means ""What's the news?""  Overall, the video presentation will give families an overview of how to celebrate Kwanzaa, a great to start celebration the holiday.",1341532800,,491,4.879518072289157

130688,5,0792146344,"I'm not a big Rugrats fan but I struggled to find a video that would explain Hannukah AND captivate my 3 year old.  This video does both.  I love the Yiddish phrases sprinkled throughout, they remind me of my culture.  I also love that they incorporate the Hebrew blessing.",1079481600,4,273,4.530612244897959
130689,5,0792146344,"Not only was this another endearing Rugrats episode, this video also had some very informative historical data.  When my fellow teachers and I decided to expand our Christmas Around the World unit, we combed your website looking for innovative ideas. Unfortunately many teachers almost have to run a ""dog and pony"" show to compete with the visual stimuli of today's world.  That's why we we so excited to find a copy of this great video that provides accurate historical and cultural information on a child's level with characters he/she recognizes and loves.  Our second grade auditory learners were delighted with the video as were the visual learners with the paperback book of the same story.  This video showed The Babies playing games and eating Chanakah snacks which we provided for our kinestic learners.  This video held seven year olds' attentions while instilling  information about the history and culture of the Jewish faith.",1041638400,14,938,5.1381578947368425
130690,5,0792146344,"This is one of my favorite Rugrats of all time. Vacation is my favorite because of love Las Vegas. The stories are cool and the comedy is great too!
Chuckie vs. The Potty.
Chuckie's being potty trained and Angelica taunts him!
Doctor Susie.
Susie learns to be a toy""doctor""and fixes the babies' toys.
But Angelica breaks them again and blames it on Susie.
Vacation Special.
The Rugrats are on vacation in Las Vegas and searching for the ""kitties""(tigers)in a live animal act. The best one in the video.
Finsterella
As Kira studies her part in Cinderella,Angelica tells Chuckie Kira's really talking about how it's going to be a home.
Bigger Than Life.
Kimi can turn anything into an adventure and Chuckie's jealous.
My least favorite.
This video is worth the money,trust me!",1005609600,5,774,4.871212121212121
130691,5,0792146344,"While ""Kwanzaa"" is fine, ""And The Winner Is..."" is well worth repeated viewings alone. It's a lot of fun to see Susie do her tap-dancing number (And a little ""Baby Elephant Walk"" to boot) to proved it once again that Angelica have spoiled another scheme against those ""Dumb Babies""! I like that one. So will you.",1003795200,,312,4.589285714285714
