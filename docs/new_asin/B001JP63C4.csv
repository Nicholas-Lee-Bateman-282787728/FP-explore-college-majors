8313269,2,B001JP63C4,"The film talks about the us Contribution the relief work for African refugees in the early 1980's. I was really more interested in news on the relief efforts then... and now. the film showed how they help African women to sew and sell what they made but it is heart braking that they then had to use that money for medical care, and there was then and still now a shortage of medicine.
