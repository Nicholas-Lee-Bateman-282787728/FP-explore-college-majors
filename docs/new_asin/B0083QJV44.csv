5124806,4,B0083QJV44,"I had the fortune of watching this series as it was being released in Japan through Crunchyroll.com and was extremely excited when Sentai Filmworks announced that they had licensed it.  Purchasing this set is a perfect way of obtaining the entire series in one fell swoop.  The only disappointments are that Sentai did not include any major special features and that the English dub is sub-par; however, the slim nature of the menus and navigation, which is common throughout all releases similar to this one (Break Blade/Broken Blade, Towanoquon, etc.) is quite attractive.  I would recommend this product to anyone, however, simply on the basis of the story.  :)  Check it out!",1349654400,2,679,5.026785714285714
5124807,5,B0083QJV44,"No. 6 is an 11 episode anime about a life changing encounter by two completely different boys, one named Sion who is considered an elite and the other, Nezumi who is supposedly a violent criminal. Two years after their first encounter, series of mysterious things start to happen,and Sion get blamed. Nezumi saves him from imprisonment and the two escape for the so called Utopian society that is No. 6.

i first saw this anime about 1 year ago, and I instantly fell in love with it. it was very well animated, the voice acting was amazing, the BGM was perfect and even lack of BGM added more pressure to the series. When i found out that it was licensed by NIS America, i nearly fell over. I couldn't wait to buy it. It was eventually released and I bought it. I was very pleased with the cover art and the and everything. I was worried about one thing though which was the English Dub. Fortunately, it wasn't as painful as i expected it to be. Of course i wouldn't say that it was better than the original because it wasn't, nevertheless, i could sit through it. My favorite extra to this dvd is that it came with commentary from the Japanese voice actors and some other people that were involved with the production. They had trivia to add in basically every episode and they continuos banter was very amusing to read. I found myself laughing in scenes that we're completely serious.

I was very happy with my purchase, although it did take a little bit longer than im used to, to arrive, regardless, it was worth the wait and I don't regret any of it. I can't wait to rewatch it again haha.",1347062400,,1594,4.418367346938775
5124808,5,B0083QJV44,"As a long-time fan of the series, I'd say it's entirely worth the money. The anime has its weak points, trying to cover 9 volumes in only 11 episodes, but it is still a great series. The dub is well done, and I certainly will make good use of my DVDs, watching the series over and over again. It has a pretty powerful message to it, too.

Especially at the marked down price, I would buy this as soon as possible. It's worth a watch, and each rewatch brings out new, subtle details in the story. In short, amazing anime!",1346457600,10,520,4.2

I've known about this show for a while, got to see episode one on the anime channel with english subtitle, this DVD of course has English Dubbed language and the english actors far as i've noticed have done a really great job.

5124810,4,B0083QJV44,"Granted it's selling for lower than the MSRP of $60 ($36 currently), but it's still tough to swallow, especially after watching it less than a year ago for free on Crunchyroll. And I remember the old days of anime when I was paying $9.99 for 3-4 episodes on VHS. But with the quantity of anime from Funimation and Sentai being sold at $50-60 for 24 episodes, it's tough to cough up the high price per episode for a series such as this one, which is really a watch once kind of series.

***Note - the four star rating has NOTHING to do with the price. Please read on.***

The series is VERY GOOD, just NOT GREAT in my opinion. The premise is sound, but it seems that 11 episodes were too little to really capture everything. It was based on a 9 volume novel series for crying out loud! So in trying to fit nine volumes of literature into 275 minutes of anime, one can notice that there are gaps in the story. Especially in the last two episodes things seem overly rushed and incomplete. I really liked the inclusion of the Shakespeare references too!

In the series, Shion is growing up in the utopia called No. 6. He shelters a boy named Nezumi (Japanese for rat) and this leads him into a whole heap of trouble. Shion and his mother lose their privileged status and are forced to move into the suburbs. Four years later, through a chance encounter (is it really a 'chance' encounter one wonders) Nezumi takes Shion outside of No. 6 and opens his eyes to the real world beyond. Shion discovers that there is much beneath the surface of the utopia, including medical experimentation on the citizens, totalitarian rule, and oppressive peacekeepers.

Really the whole problem is that they only made 11 episodes. The characters are interesting but don't have time to fully develop, at least not to the extent one would hope. The final two episodes seem rushed and the conclusion, while fitting, is kind of forgetful. When the last episode ended I was thinking ""That's it?""

Animation is very good quality, on par with some of Gonzo's works. The Japanese language cast is very good. I haven't listened to an English dub, so I cannot comment on that. Music is decent, though not exceptional. The story is great and very interesting, just pared down quite a bit from the novels.

Overall a good series, but perhaps worthy of watching first if you have access to episodes via Netflix or another streaming service. If it were pushed down to $22 (or $2 per episode) then I would heartily recommend a purchase. At this point, buy if you really like it, I'm just glad that personally, I was able to watch first.

For this style of anime, I feel Ergo Proxy, Now and Then Here and There, Last Exile, and Shangri-La are better for re-watching. This is a good series to at least watch once. I just don't think I would really get much more from subsequent views.",1345593600,4,2845,4.53411306042885
5124811,4,B0083QJV44,"[This review is based on the No. 6 Blu-ray, which is already shipping.]

The 11 episode No. 6 anime is based on a dystopian young adult science fiction novel by Asano Atsuko. Its two main protagonists are 16-year-old boys, Shion and Nezumi (aka ""Rat""). The backgrounds of these two could hardly be more disparate although they share a very strong bond from the time that first meet as 12-year-olds. Shion is a genius and one of No. 6's elites while Nezumi is equally brilliant but comes from a background of nightmarish suffering. Their childhoods have molded their vastly different personalities. Shion wants to save No. 6 from itself; Nezumi hates it and wants to destroy it.

Bleeding from a severe bullet wound and thinking that he is about to die, Nezumi sees Shion standing on the balcony outside his bedroom, screaming passionately into the face of a monster typhoon. With the last of his strength, Nezumi scales the wall to Shion's balcony and holds him at knifepoint. Instead of being terrified, Shion invites Nezumi in, treats his wounds, and then provides him with a meal and a bed. They fall asleep holding hands and for the first time in his life, Nezumi thinks, ""humans are warm."" Nezumi vanishes before Shion awakes but from that day forward, he never leaves Shion's thoughts.

Although the two have no direct contact from the next four years, Nezumi watches over Shion out of a sense of gratitude and obligation (and perhaps something more). When Shion let Nezumi in without reporting it to the authorities, Shion committed the crime of harboring a fugitive. This results in Shion's being kicked out of a school for No. 6's elites and his family's being moved into a much more downscale dwelling, where his mother now operates a bakery. Shion is forced to take on a low-status job operating janitor robots in one of No. 6's many parks. It is here that he witnesses a mysterious death and is arrested shortly thereafter on a trumped-up charge of murder. Nezumi then reappears and their reunion sets the densely-packed plot in motion.

The anime moves along briskly and coherently for the first 10 episodes. Unfortunately, 11 episodes are insufficient to cover the material in the nine-volume novel. Episode 11, which veers away from the novel, suffers from excessive plot compression and the fact that some crucial emotional beats are skipped over lightly or missed entirely. The episode contains a hard-to-accept deus ex machina and a denouement that anyone who has not read the novel will find utterly bewildering. That being said, some critics have accused episode 11 of being unprepared or random. This is unfair; there is nothing in episode 11 that has not been previously foreshadowed although most viewers will have to watch the anime twice to appreciate this.

This series is imbued with Studio Bones' usual high production values. Backgrounds are detailed and beautifully colored, characters are uniquely designed and fluidly animated, and there are plot points that are startlingly fresh, although Asano-sensei can take credit for most of the latter. Some visual symbolism rises to the level of fine art, transcending this anime's pop-culture genre. Only the musical score is a bit of a letdown although it rises to the occasion during the emotionally-charged, beautifully eerie climax at the end of episode five. (In the category of ""impossible dreams,"" I would have loved to have heard a Ralph Vaughn-Williams score in the anime.)

The Blu-ray's 1080p picture is flawless and the Japanese voice actors, both veterans and newcomers, are at the top of their game. One of the Blu-ray's greatest strengths is a running commentary by the Japanese voice actors who play Shion and Nezumi, along with various guests. Gratifyingly, English subtitles are provided for all 11 episodes of the commentary. My only complaint is that a key title card, shown at the end of the Japanese broadcast version of episode 11 and essential for the closure that it brought, does not appear in the Blu-ray version being reviewed.

All too often in anime, English-language dubs are cringeworthy, offering deliveries so wooden that one wonders whether the actors could even get hired for third-rate dinner theater. There are no such problems here. Shion's English voice actor is excellent, Nezumi's is nearly as good, and most of the rest of the cast is competent or better.

Although its main component is science-fiction, No. 6 also has an understated BL/yaoi* component that has made it controversial, dividing its audience into two groups: those who appreciate it as pure science-fiction (although science-fiction that is far more ""chamber music"" than ""space opera"") and those who value the anime's unusual character development and subtle BL components above its purely dystopian science-fiction aspects, the last being the least original parts of the plot. Fans of pure science-fiction shouldn't worry; the ""blink and you'll miss them"" BL aspects are so underplayed that, compared to the main thrust of the plot, they are unlikely to make any viewer uncomfortable. Audiences can watch No. 6 in at least two ways: as an above-average science-fiction anime or as perhaps the greatest BL anime ever, precisely because the BL aspect is woven into the overall story in such a low-key and organic way.

If it weren't for the weak ending, this would be a five-star anime. As it is, it rates a solid four.

* For some people, No. 6 casts an alluring spell. It shares a certain ""theatrical"" spirit with the TV show ""Glee,"" but No. 6 is darker and more melodramatic. (There's nothing wrong with melodrama per se--when well done, it merely distills action and emotion for dramatic effect.)

No. 6 is not an anime for prom kings or jocks, who will find it perfectly serviceable as science-fiction but who are likely to miss the subtext as it whizzes over their heads. No. 6 works its magic on outsiders--those who feel they don't belong, those who have fallen in love with art and literature while being indifferent to sports and proms, and particularly those of amorphous or unconventional sexuality. In Nezumi, they have an antihero who overcame appalling adversity to become beautiful, strong, and courageous--a skilled, scarred fighter, but also a snarky, sarcastic intellectual who loves music and books (Shakespeare most of all), and whose normal apparel and behavior are perfectly masculine--yet he also looks stunning while wearing flowers in his hair and a frock. (For once in anime, the cross-dressing appears briefly, is integral to the plot, and is not played for laughs.)

No. 6's most powerful subtext is that Nezumi, an alienated outsider and one of anime's deepest and most fascinating characters, is worthy of being loved by someone equally as intelligent yet utterly different--someone who illuminates Nezumi's darkness and who never gives up on him even in extremis.

Susceptible people fall for No. 6's protagonists, hard. Despite its mere 11-episode run on Japanese television, No. 6 has inspired a plethora of beautifully wrought fan-art and over 600 stories (mostly in English) on Fanfiction dot net. The No. 6 manga was recently licensed for the U.S. and will appear in English mid-2013. In addition, a very well crafted fan translation of the original novel has been completed (by 9ave), and a translation of Asano's follow-up book of side-stories (No 6: Beyond) is underway. I highly recommend the novel because it illuminates the characters' inner lives in a way that the anime does not. The novel deserves to be licensed and published in English, but until that day comes, the fan-work will have to do.",1345334400,40,7623,5.04527402700556

It was a dark and stormy night and young teen is out on the balcony screaming to vent. In the woods his voice is heard by another whom is not much older. This other person is wounded and manages to enter trough the balcony. It turns out that this wounded person aka Rat is a fugitive.
 I will not tell you all that happens but after dressing his wounds the two develop a friendship. Rat explains that he lives outside the city and that what the residents of the city are told and what reality is are two different things.
 Time passes and Rat reappears and now saves the teens life.  At Rats side he leaves all & everyone that he has known and if he returns he will be killed. No longer in the lap of luxury his eyes are opened to the horrors that comes with living outside the city.
 These are not stand alone episodes so it plays like a movie and since this is not out yet I can say anything about the extras that will be on the disc.

 There is much, much more to this story but that is the premises. How do you right such a terrible injustice to those outside the city? What difference can two people make?
 My feeble explanation does not do the show justice. Will I but this show...yes,but more around the 30-40 dollar range.

 I can not say ""You should buy this"" or ""this is the best I've seen""...etc. I can tell you it was good show, just over 4 stars. Animation is good from start to finish and ranges from average to slightly above. This story moves forward from start to finish and never gets bogged down. There is blood but nothing over the top.

I think the manga gives you more detail that is left out in this series. 11 episodes seems short and I say that because the scenes throughout the episodes aren't fully developed/lack depth maybe another 3 or 4 episodes and I would have been even more satisfied so that's why I only gave this 4 stars. I kept wanting more from the character development. I do like Sion's and Rat's relationship, it's slow moving and it doesn't really pick up until the very end and then with the last episode it gives you a cliffhanger ending. But with that being said the artwork and voice actors were amazing, both in the dub and in the japanese version.

5124819,5,B0083QJV44,"No. 6 Review

I have been anxious to write a review of No. 6 since I binge-watched the series two weeks ago on Crunchyroll. Once I had done that however, I quickly purchased the series on Blu-ray as I wanted everything No. 6 that I could get my hands on. This anime and story is just that good! Yes, it has its flaws, but what anime doesnt, right? Nevertheless, overall, the story, the animation, the acting, the action, the emotion and the music are all here in No. 6. This is the best anime that I have ever seen. This has been the only anime that ever knocked me sideways and had me limping, stumbling, and trying to find my way back out into the real world to rebuild my emotional center!

I know right?! No. 6 draws you in unexpectedly and slowly annihilates your emotions. You fall in love with the characters and fight right along-side them. Right from the beginning, you feel the melancholic tug between the main characters of Nezumi and Shion most powerfully by simplest of actions and then by the most moving of ending anthems  the gorgeously heart-rending, Rokutousei no Yoru by a wonderful artist and writer by the name of Aimer. She is truly wonderful and her song fits this piece perfectly. The same can also be said of the opening them by Lama entitled, Spell. Once you experience the translations, it makes these works so much more than mere songs  they indeed contribute to the relationship of the main characters and the story.

SPOILER ALERT

Let me begin by saying first and foremost that no disrespect whatsoever to the creator, Ms. Asano is intended at all here.

The main problem that I have with the anime, as well as the novels (because, as I said, I had to get my hands on everything No. 6, right?, so I read 2 of the novels  and the story differs quite a bit, but there the ending is basically the same, as I am about to mention here, so read no further if you have not watched the series or read the novels, please!) is that Nezumi and Shion, after saving each other emotionally, physically, and spiritually many times in fact  do not end up together, per se.

We all know this is fiction, butif two people had found each other the way that these two had, and had gone through as much as these two had, together, and realized how very special and very rare that was, and how precious this all was, there is not the slimmest chance in all of the universe that Nezumi would have walked away from Shion and promised that they would meet again one day. In the novel, this promise is made much more of a point than in the anime and you end the reading on a much higher note.

In the anime, with the coupling of the ending theme, you wonder if they will ever see each other again! This is evident by the animation sequence during the ending theme when Nezumi throws the snowball and the sequence turns into a memory where Shion reaches up to catch that snowball, but the season, perhaps even the year, has changed and he reaches up to catch, nothing. It is very sad.

Everyone will have a differing point of view of course. Some will agree with Nezumi that he wanted to see who Shion could become and what he would accomplish on his own. But seriously, you can accomplish great things together even if you are very different. Love, and a very special one at that, does not come along everydayor for every-one (intentional). One doesnt simply toss love aside by citing that we are different. Our differences are exactly what attract us to each other as well as our similarities. And, by the way, Nezumi and Shion are not opposites, they are just different. In the end, especially as emphasized in the novel, Shion continues to wait and says he will always wait for his perfect partner to come back and that when he (Nezumi) does, (he) will not just let him leave. So, there is a great deal of hope for their future in that speech. Nevertheless, it all really works I suppose, because they do not go off into the sunset together. The reader/viewer ends up with hope beyond hope that these two will somehow, someday be together.

END SPOILER ALERT

Now, there is so much more that I would like to say and will perhaps write more at some point because I find myself discovering more each time re-watch the episodes in both languages and listening /reading the Japanese commentary which is very interesting.  In the meantime, I very highly recommend watching and purchasing the Blu-ray version of No. 6.",1456444800,6,4420,4.473291925465839

Without spoiling too much, Sion is a genius young boy raised in the Utopian society known simply as No. 6. On a dark, typhoon stricken night, his easy existence is turned on its head when a mysterious boy breaks into his open window. He learns that the strangers name is Nezumi or ""rat"" and that he is an escaped VC being hunted down by their government. He treats Nezumi's wounds, and the two discuss the finer points of reality. In the morning, Nezumi has vanished, leaving Sion to deal with the fallout.

Sion is questioned, stripped of his rank for abetting the escape of an outlaw, and forced to live in the Lost Town of No. 6.

Four years pass, and Sion finds himself smack in the middle of conspiracy once more; apprehended for a crime he didn't commit, until Nezumi returns and saves him, whisking Sion away and to the outlying West Block that resides beyond the walls of No. 6.

With a parisitic epidemic looming on the horizon for the unwitting citizens of No. 6, Sion scrambles to find a way to prevent it; while Nezumi stands back, waiting to relish in the hated cities demise.

This anime is dark, posing viable questions of the cruel reality of a Utopian world that thrives on the suffering of citizens who are not worth more than a means to an end to the people who run it.

While at times the plot can be slightly outlandish toward the end, and confusing, the relationship built between Nezumi and Sion is well worth the watch through of the scant 11 episodes.

You can relish in the gorgeous, detailed art and the rich, complex characters.

My only qualm with this anime is the English dub voice actor choices. While I am never one to nit-pick over dubs, I did originally watch this anime in Japanese and find the casting of all the characters to have been ill picked, and piss poor at best. Nezumi sounds awkwardly stiff, not at all charismatic and cynical, and Greg Ayres as Sion just grated against my nerves. That being said, if you don't mind subs, the Japanese voice actors did a stellar job!

Shion finds himself in danger and arrested on suspicion of murder as he looks for answers to the mysterious deaths that are plaguing No. 6 and putting his loved ones in danger. All the while, Rat has become a reliable friend for Shion and tries to protect him.

This anime is very interesting. The artwork is great. It's got a unique story and characters to match. It has mystery, thrills and chills, touching moments and even a bit of comedy. I haven't come across anything like it. The main characters are opposites, but they're a great pair. I really wish there were more episodes, because 11 isn't nearly enough.",1384819200,2,801,4.5625
5124843,4,B0083QJV44,"Although the premise and characters are not entirely original, I grew quite fond of No. 6 and its off center method of telling a story that makes us ask ourselves tough questions. The show started off as most similar stories do with the sweeping exaggeration of the greatness of the utopia that is No. 6 juxtaposed against the desperation of one of the protagonists struggle to escape the clutches of its oppression. Out of all of these warmed over undertones of a rotten prison lurking within paradise emerge touching relationships and believable characters with very real motivations and emotional struggles.

While I would not categorize any of the characters or concepts in this series as original (especially not Nezumi, who is almost an exact copy of Saotome Alto from Macross Frontier) I am highly impressed by the storytelling and synthesis of all of these elements to form a very unique work that, in my humble opinion, delivers powerful messages and encourages us to question the world around us.

Until the last two episodes, the animation is excellent, and even after the drop off in animation quality that is evident in the final two episodes, it never takes away from the experience to any measurable degree. The ending is simultaneously highly satisfying and somewhat open ended forcing you to trust in the characters that guided you through the story (that's a good thing in my opinion).

Overall, if you have not seen this diamond in the rough you should most certainly view it. While not perfect, it is quite memorable and thought provoking and certainly worthy of 11 episodes of viewing time.",1381104000,,1611,4.937269372693727

5124845,5,B0083QJV44,Shonen Ai at it's best.  These two have such a special relationship.  I enjoyed the Manga but the Anime had the songs and colour that brought so much to this story.,1376784000,,164,4.258064516129032
5124846,4,B0083QJV44,"The story itself is much deeper than you would think. Even long after I've read and seen it I still find myself thinking back on it and catching things that I never caught before. There's so much to it that it's one of the things that's sometimes nice to revisit and see in a new light.

However, the anime itself isn't as I good as I expected (or rather wanted, really). Basically this could have done a lot better but seeing that it's only 11 episodes, it isn't bad and quite nice, especially for those who would couldn't wait for the manga translations. It didn't catch me like the manga did, especially the way that the characters developed.

I suggest that people that watch this also read it, you'll get a lot more from it when you do!

Edit:
I was scrolling the reviews and I must add that the story isn't about two boys falling in love. There is that underlying undertone, however, but looking closely at their relationship, you'll find that there is much, much more to it than a crush or love. Watch how they interact to each other and you'll be surprised at what you'll find.",1375574400,2,1085,4.415
5124847,5,B0083QJV44,"Amazing animation, lovely voice work--even in the English dub--and great story line. NO. 6 has action and suspense--and a little gore--that draws you into the story of a futuristic world that has been ravaged by natural disasters, leaving only six colonies spread throughout the world, with the sixth being the most secretive and overprotective. Indicator species somehow killing off humans by bursting out of their necks after turning them from young and healthy to old and decrepit in seconds. Poor Shion gets thrust into the middle of this after helping a runaway named Nezumi (aka Rat in the English dub.) when he was younger. (Want more details there, buy the series!)

Though short, this anime instantly captured my heart when I saw Nezumi all grown up. Then it melted my heart when it gave us the single song he sang. His Japanese voice is absolutely beautiful! I first watched this series on the internet as it was coming out in Japan and thus had a bunch of fansubs, but I didn't care. I was hooked. I recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys the aforementioned action and suspense with a tinge of gore, or those who enjoy great story telling in a short amount of time. Or even those who enjoy hinted-at pairings between the two main characters.",1373068800,2,1255,4.756880733944954
5124848,5,B0083QJV44,"After reading some of the reviews I saw that some people may need to be specifically told what this series is about.

***Spoilers***

The story is about a love that is quite a bit deeper than a yaoi. This light novel series, turned anime series, is listed as shojo science fiction (shojo meaning girls between the ages of 10 and 18). The biggest thing I've seen in reviews that talk about it being boy's love in the literal sense. Yes, this novel has some hints that the two have some sort of attraction for one another, however this attraction is more along the lines of a deep-rooted bro-mance than yaoi (male X male sexual relationships in manga). There is a dance scene to elicit happiness, and two goodbye kisses that resemble what I've seen my European roommates use on their brothers before they leave. So while there are a lot of people who 'want' this series to be considered yaoi, it is not. Japanese manga/light novels have quite a few of these types of relationships between two men or two women and people automatically jump to the conclusion that it must be a homosexual relationship, which clouds the deeper meaning to the story.

The music in this series is great. The Japanese seiyuu (voice actor) who plays Nezumi (Rat) has quite the singing voice. I prefer to watch the series in the original language, so I have not seen it dubbed in English, which means I cannot comment on the English cast. I think they chose well for all members of the cast, even if they probably should have had girls play the two boys when they were younger since most 12 year old kids haven't completely matured enough to have their adult voice yet.

The animation is very crisp and one can almost see what it's like to live on the outskirts of the perfect world in which Shion once lived. The gritty detail is quite different than other shojo types I've run across, making this anime/light novel seem almost more for the adult female rather than the tween/teen female. I'm going to assume it's geared toward that age group mainly because the two main characters are in that age bracket as well.

If someone hasn't read the books then I recommend reading them just to get more detail. There are quite a few novels and condensing them into 11 episodes was probably quite the chore. However, even if a person doesn't read the novels, the anime covers the entire span of the books, so nothing big is missed. This is a great series for anyone willing to give it half a chance and see what the series is truly about.",1369785600,12,2505,4.533185840707965
5124849,5,B0083QJV44,"The story is completely finished by the end of the series and the animation is very detailed.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes a story about a totalitarian society.",1369008000,,272,4.6875
5124850,4,B0083QJV44,"I really didn't know what to expect from this title, since I bought it blind.

5124851,4,B0083QJV44,"My fiance and I really liked this fairly new anime: No. 6. The animation is breathtaking and the quality is amazing. The music score happens to be awesome too! The storyline is okay, definitely not the best, but I've seen much worse. It started out really great and then went downhill toward the end. Though, I feel like this is just because it's only 11 episodes, I'm sure it could have been epic, had it been longer and more developed. The characters are very interesting and well-created, considering an 11 episode run. It's a bit pricey at the moment - $40 or so for an 11 episode anime is steep (personally I'd say a good deal would be if it was $20-25), but if you are itching for a new anime that's beautiful, engaging, with great music and cool characters, and the price doesn't scare you, you can't go wrong with No. 6.",1366156800,,828,4.4183006535947715

The dub is poorly done, It's not that the voice actors that are bad, it's just that there where multiple times that the voice wouldn't align with the mouth movements (voices would be heard and the character's mouth was either not moving yet or had already stopped moving) It's not even just this, the DVD menu is boring with no sound, it's a still picture, and has no notable special features. With the amount you pay for a Sentai anime it's unacceptable to receive a product that seems like little to no effort was put into it.",1359244800,5,651,4.572649572649572

The settings are detailed and the characters are well plotted out. Each character has their own wants and needs and you just can't wait to learn more about them. Then there is the plot, which is also fascinating. This anime is a mixture of science-fiction, mystery, action, a little bit of romance, and maybe even moments of slight drama. Another thing about this anime is that it's a perfect fit for anyone who is into BL, the BL moments are so small though that anyone who isn't into that can easily overlook them.

I have to say this show could have been much better. The first half was severely addictive to watch. However I feel it dropped off by the end. It reminded me a lot of shangri-la with the same concept on how the whole utopia city was created. And I have to say that threw me off. If your looking for a show just like shangri-la then this is your show. If your looking for a show with a good solid ending, that doesn't just throw some mythological concept at you in the last few episodes so they don't have to explain the many holes in the story, then look for another show. A better rebellion anime where people fight the current regime, code geass lelouch of the rebellion will be more north your $.
