3926237,5,B002H3EU9A,"I am a dance addict so I am going to recommend this movie to you if you enjoy dancing as well.  It wasn't a high budget movie, but the storyline was good as was the dancing.  And it doesn't hurt that I have taken some dance workshops from several people in this movie as well as the producer.  Try it, you'll like it.",1260748800,6,317,4.0
3926238,4,B002H3EU9A,"I love west coast swing so was looking forward to the dance segments only, as I has read reviews that said the movies was predictable with poor acting. I agree that the story line is very typical, BUT I thought the movie was enjoyable to watch. The acting was fine, the characters likable. It is abit unfortunate that competition dancers were portrayed as so idiosyncratic, but the inclusion of complete dance segments more then made up for that.
If you enjoy watching dance movies and love Ballroom and/or west coast swing this is really worth buying. I give the movie 4 stars -- as I really enjoyed watching!",1260576000,3,610,4.657407407407407
3926239,3,B002H3EU9A,As a dancer in particularly west coast swing and knowing Robert Royston and his wife I really like the movie.  However it felt short of how good it could have been.  I could tell that the funding was not there to finish the movie and fill in the dead spots.  It definately was not a dance with me or dirty dancing but could have been.,1260316800,6,334,4.107692307692307

3926242,1,B002H3EU9A,"...save your money...this film is terrible. Thank goodness I only rented it from Video on Demand. Dialogue is atrocious. I was hoping the dance sequences would save it...especially since Benji Schwimmer (Season 2 SYTYCD) is included, but there is actually very little dancing at all.

3926368,5,B002H3EU9A,"DANCE POEM

Ive found the key to the secret of life!
Its not what you think!
Its not God, or sex, or drink!
Its not sniffing glue, smoking weed,
Or getting passionate over politics!
Its not looking up at the vast night sky
And contemplating the universe!
Its a secret, but Ill happily share it
For those who are willing to believe.
Its DANCING!!!
Amazon Prime has these dance videos,
Starring wonderful, talented, glorious dancers.
I watch on my computer and stand up
So I can see more clearly.
And I sway while I watch, gently rolling
My hips back and forth.
I arch my back and stretch my arms and legs,
All to the rhythm of West Coast Swing Dancing
Mixed with a little of jazz!
While I sway, I get carried away
And believe I, too, am a dancer
(Actually I once really was)
I feel myself fall almost to the floor
then caught in the arms of my handsome partner.
I slide on the floor between his legs
To thunderous applause from the audience
I am lifted up above his head
My whole body swirling in circles in mid-air
While he holds me aloft like a balanced trophy
Then I regain my stand on the floor
And we both take turns showing off
Our individual dance moves.
This is all in my mind, of course,
But not entirely. Theres a grain of truth here.
I have various videos on my watch list:
Dance films, yoga for beginners, easy-to-learn tai chi,
All of which things I once did before.
I was also inspired to work out with weights
So my arms can get stronger.
I will gradually improve my balance,
Regain a degree of grace
And no longer look so awkward.
It may take a long time, of course,
But if I stay my course
And keep to this dance and exercise routine,
One day, you may say, you no longer know me
As the person in the wheel chair
You were used to before!
You may see me as a dancer
As I now see myself in my minds eye,
Whirling and twirling across the floor.
Thank you! You may now applaud!",1468108800,,1888,4.1726027397260275

Being a dancer myself, I might be a bit more critical than most. If you nothing of this style, you will probably really enjoy the moves. Amy Smart was great and Billy Zane was hot as usual and portrayed his character well. The Ex-fiance's story with the main character was confusing - I was not impressed with either of their acting performances.",1462752000,,507,4.582417582417582

3926716,3,B002H3EU9A,"I'm a sucker for a movie about dance...  and I love good ""bad"" movie every once in a while... but this one is quite terrible.  The male actor who play Jake is supposed to be deaf, yet he is super inconsistent throughout the movie.  It's like he forgets his character can't hear and will react to something, but then there will be an ordeal like someone talking behind him, and he magically can't hear it?

Huge downside to this film was the use of the ""R"" word (and then not saying it was bad but rather everyone laughing about it) and the terribly portrayed stereotypes of gays/lesbians.  Honestly, super cringe-worthy.

The dancing in this film is incredible, and honestly the only reason I'm giving this movie 3 stars.  Also, the cast is quite impressive (though the acting is atrocious.).

Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but definitely not worth watching a second time.",1462579200,,878,4.6558441558441555

3926735,1,B002H3EU9A,What a catastrophe. I would have been better off thinking Billy Zane and Amy Smart had died than to see them fall into the abyss of this devastatingly horrible movie. Think: late night cinemax meets lifetime special. Only without the sex or the life lesson. Add a lethal dose of Christian rock band soundtrack without the Jesus and: Abracadabra... I will never be the same. Childhood dreams neatly crushed in roughly ninety minutes of open-mouthed horror.,1462406400,,455,5.0

3926819,5,B002H3EU9A,"I loved this film!  I love films like this in general.  Some people may have not liked it, and that is fine.  Everyone has preferences, but I feel that this film showed that those who made it had a great deal of heart.
Plot plausibility? It is a movie, not a documentary.

If you listen to the commentary, Tom Malloy states that it is not a big movie production with money to burn.  It was a labor of love for the Royston's and Mr. Malloy who both struggled to find funding for it.  They both put a lot of themselves, personally and financially, into the movie to make it happen, which is why perhaps it wasn't as perfect as if it was produced by a big production studio.  It bothers me how people are into instant gratification and eager to criticize.

The dancing is inspiring!!  I totally agree with Mr. Malloy in the commentary, if you are dancing, you should feel good and smile, because it should be fun - because it is!!
What I liked most was the definite positive message to the whole movie.  Wake up and live life!

It is a great feel good movie that definitely makes you want to dance.  To correct someone's comments, Tom Malloy isn't deaf, he portrays someone who is deaf.  Focusing on the message of the movie, what matters is that you try.  If you work hard on a goal, you might just amaze yourself.  Who cares what others think.  In the end, what matters is if you are happy or not. If you are not, do something about it.  And yes, you would be amazed at what you can do if you put your mind to it!

Nicola Royston is absolutely amazing!  She plays 'Jake's' old fiance and dance partner, whose character in the movie wasn't very nice to 'Jake', but Jake overcomes that, and doesn't listen to her character's negative message.

If you want to see a great feel good film, with a great message, with no violence or swearing, this is it.  It is cute, funny, charming, inspirational, and has some really great dancing by real people and real West Coast Swing champions who are amazing.  Thank you to Tom Malloy and Robert and Nicola Royston!

3926837,2,B002H3EU9A,"Robert Iscove's ""Love N' Dancing"" chronicles the romance between an attractive middle school teacher and a deaf dance instructor she meets at a school assembly.  The trouble is that Jessica (Amy Smart) is already engaged to a workaholic (a bald Billy Zane) who's always on his cell phone, while Jake (played by screenwriter Tom Malloy), who holds the title of World West Coast Swing Champion, is still carrying the torch for a former flame who has already moved onto a new love interest and dance partner.

A paint-by-numbers romantic comedy, ""Love N` Dancing"" has moments of undeniable charm - in its early stages at least - but the triteness of the plotting, the uncharismatic performances, the motley secondary characters (Rachel Dratch and Bette White make brief appearances), and the surfeit of implausibilities wind up taking their toll in the end.

The dancing is cool, though.",1276732800,2,884,5.082758620689655

3926841,1,B002H3EU9A,"There seem to be a lot stars for this movie based on the fact that it includes some pretty awesome dance routine footage.  They're great, but there are simply not enough of them to overshadow the fact that this movie is enragingly and poorly written.

The plot is ever so Shall We Dance, but switch the genders of the teacher and student, have her leave the estranged spouse, and make one of them ""deaf"" and boom!

The acting is bad.  I mean, really bad.  If your character is deaf and you forget to ACT DEAF, there is something seriously wrong.

Why are there lesbians in this plot?  Completely superfluous and offensively portrayed lesbians?  I don't understand their purpose at all!

The dialogue is crap.

I could go on and on.

If you want to see dancing, go out and join a class, attend a conference, visit a competition!  There are more than enough dancers, with really good dancing to enjoy without having routines interrupted with this poor excuse of a plotline.  And best yet?

3926842,5,B002H3EU9A,"The story line is similar to other movies about dance competition and dance partners falling in love such as ""Dance With Me"" and ""Strictly Dancing."" LOVE N' DANCING is unique in that the entire focus of competition is West Coast Swing and not Ballroom Dancing. Although the acting is not Oscar worthy, the movie works well with a nice balance of the easy to follow love story and excellent dancing by some of the best West Coast Swing dancers in the world. The following couples appear as dance competitors performing full routines: Ronnie Debenedetta & Brandi Tobias, Parker Dearborn & Jessica Cox, Jordan Frisbee & Tatiana Mollman, Benji Schwimmer & Heidi Groskreutz, and Marcus Smith & Deanna Ball. Former U.S. Open Swing Dance Champion, Robert Royston, has his stamp all over the video: He produced the movie, was the dance choreographer and appears as the MC at the major dance competitions. His wife, Nicola Royston, portrays the ex-partner and former girl friend of the male lead in the movie (played by Tom Malloy).  Ballroom and West Coast Swing instructor, Michael Kiehm, appears as one of the judges of the final dance competition and is seen doing some social dancing towards the end of the movie with his wife and dance partner, Dawne Kiehm. DVD extras include a limited 30-minute Introduction to West Coast Swing lesson by Royston, which covers the basic footwork (6-count) and only 3 dance steps: (Underarm Turn & Right Side Pass, Sugar Push, and Left Side Pass).  Also included is a short video clip of the winning couple of an ""On Line Dance Contest"" performing their WCS routine.

8370138,3,B002H3EU9A,"If you're watching this movie for the love triangle (engaged couple with the guy too busy with work to be attentive to his fianc, the fianc frustrated that he won't take dance lessons with her and the deaf dance instructor who warms her heart) it is only so-so although I thought Tom Malloy did a great job as the instructor.  Billy Zane was appropriately self-centered and annoying to aptly show why his fianc was fated to lose interest in him and fall for the instructor.  Amy Smart did an adequate job as the neglected fianc and this is the first movie I've seen her in since Starship Troopers.

The real reason to watch this movie is because of the great dancing in it and for that I would give it 4 1/2 stars rather than the 3 stars I gave it for the romantic triangle angle of the movie.  Nicola Royston, Jordan Frisbee, Tatiana Mollman, Jessica Cox, John Lindo (in an uncredited role) and a host of other very talented dancers appear in the movie.  Alas, Nicola's real life husband Robert Royston doesn't dance in the movie although he also appears as an emcee at a dance competition.  Of course, Frisbee and Mollman were dance partners winning competitions galore for years so it is fun to watch them dance together in this movie.
