Art strolls with us through London's various sections-Ealing,West Hampstead,Muswell Hill,Putney,Soho,oxford street,Regent Street,Saville Row-He's been there, knows his way around and can point out interesting tidbits relating to all these neighborhoods.
One of the things I like best about this film was that it was shot on just absolutely gorgeous sunny, green-leafy London afternoons. Everything looks clean and pleasant.
Next what I liked is host Art Wood, a very likeable chap who with his group the Artwoods touched a bit of fame in the mid-1960's. He talks all about the clubs and the groups of that era, taking us through the doors of places the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks et al sowed their oats-the 100 Club, Ronnie Scott's,Klook's Kleek and The Half Moon in Putney. (the ""'alf Moon"" as we hear Art call it)
I enjoy listening to British pronounciations such as Art referring to ""the Tem's"" meaning The Thames River which I, of course, a mere American would pronounce as ""Tames"". Or how a Brit will say ""here in the Goldhawk road was the first time......."" whereas I would say ""here ON Goldhawk road....."".
Also we American's don't usually NAME our homes whereas in Britain apparently they do as Art points out the former home of his brother Ronnie's which is called ""The Wick"". ""He lived right there in The Wick which now belongs to Pete Townsend.""
Rock n Roll London begins with Art taking us over a foot bridge to a very small island located in the Thames called Eel Pie Island where many a band played back in the old days.
Frequently during our guide with Art we hear selections from his old band playing in the background and as I listened to Art speak I hear that same voice although much younger singing on those old Artwood songs like Big City.
We learn that Jon Lord of Deep Purple fame and Kief Hartley were members of the Artwoods as well.
Charing Cross Road, Denmark street (London's tin pan alley), the famous club The Marquee on Waldour street (""In"" Waldour street I should say!),the London Palladium, Carnaby street...Art takes us around to all of them and talks about them with a warm sense of humor as well.
At one point we nip into a local pub where Art sits down for a pint with Kinks drummer Mick Avory. (""I think Mick Avory is lurking about in here somwhere"")
As a special bonus included after the main program is a lengthy interview with Avory sharing many stories and memories of his 20 years with the band.
I really enjoyed this panoramic view of London and I thought Art made a wonderful tour guide.
There is exactly one deduction I will make and that is for the cheezy artwork given to the DVD cover. They could've done something MUCH better!",1268524800,,2773,4.661224489795918
8102898,1,B000DWN0G6,"OK, nothing against Art Wood, but this is so boring that I couldn't watch it all. The guy seems affable enough as he describes the music scene in front of or inside of landmark clubs. If you were there in person with him and he was your guide on a rock walk, maybe you could deal with the anecdotes after downing a few pints yourself. This guy isn't famous enough to make the tour interesting and the bulk of the shots are focused on him. This is like a tourist shooting a home video that wasn't edited. The product description states: ""Venture into clubland scene and relish the names that found fame in these musical Meccas as well as settling down with Art for the odd pint as he entertains us in his own unique way."" Art is like someone's elderly grandfather recalling his glory days-at least he has a sense of humor about it as he pokes jabs at his more famous brother Ron (who we never see), the Stones, and other groups/people whose careers were launched in the clubs Art visits. It's another sub-par video marketing venture to make a buck off nostalgia. They made a few off of me! Don't buy this.",1212624000,,1104,4.390243902439025
