5990532,5,B00FFHHQNM,"Detailed videos of specifically what to look for before trading a stock. I've watched these DVDs repeatedly to improve my trading. I like the thorough discussions on the importance of preparation before making a trade. There are also great examples on the DVDs of actual trades using the techniques Csquared Trading employs. It's practical info, once learned, will give you a definite advantage.

Also, Csquared trading has the most connected and engaged mentors around. It's worth your time (and money) to check them out.",1382227200,,522,5.214285714285714

8615239,5,B00FFHHQNM,"Awesome stuff Ben! The trading content is broken up into well organized chapters that are easy to follow.  Ben does a great job of laying out the basics, building the concepts in each video on top of prior ones and using example charts to illustrate his points.  Overall, the videos are detailed and well worth the money.",1449705600,,321,4.614035087719298

8615242,1,B00FFHHQNM,Please don't buy this DVD. Save your money for real trading and learning. It's a 2 hours plus information on support and resistance and minor info you can readily get from Internet for FREE. This DVD is a precursor to scam you to join their one on one expensive unprofessional course. Just stay away from this company.,1413158400,9,318,4.5964912280701755

8615244,5,B00FFHHQNM,"I strongly reccomend this dvd to anyone wanting to trade for profit.  Until I began working with Ben, I never realized that I was trading based on emotions and hype.  Ben covers everything from stock screening to cash management for any size portfolio. I paid for the cost of this dvd with one (first) trade.",1382918400,2,308,4.581818181818182
8615245,5,B00FFHHQNM,"I first go involved with C2squared Trading when I signed up for the free stock alerts where Ben would consistently text me during trading hours what he was buying and selling. He also included a nightly watch list which helped me prepare myself for my day of trading before the market opened. After seeing  Ben profit live daily, I felt the need to figure out his strategy. I then purchased Stock Market Mentor which educated me how to set up my entire trading platform and use indicators to supplement my ability to profit based of of his break out strategies. These DVDs are both educational and entertaining however the best part of C2squared Trading is that Ben is very personable and allows you to call/text him with any questions or concerns during and after trading hours. It is important to have a mentor who is passionate about teaching his students and thats what Stock Market Mentor has given  me.",1382313600,,908,4.70440251572327
8615246,5,B00FFHHQNM,"Ben takes you from speculator to regulator. This video shows you exactly how to look for certain indicators that make  me money on a consistent basis. If you follow his rules as I have then I see no reason not to find success with this system in this video. I was merely throwing darts before this material. Ben is always an email away also which makes his method that more valuable if any questions arise. I started with an account that was getting hammered, then I found this video and took some lessons from him and am now up well over 100% in my portfolio. The money spent with Ben is recouped very fast. I am verified on Profit.ly [...] if there are any doubts..I now am a 60% plus winning trader with nothing but success with the methods in this video. IT WORKS . He is a  great teacher and has a true proven passion for people to learn from his reliable method.

Thanks
