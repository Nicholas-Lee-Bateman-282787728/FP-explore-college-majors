8377639,5,B002QBE0RU,"For some reason, vol 1 and the complete collection are incredibily rare, but got a good price on vol two.",1378512000,,105,4.3
8377640,5,B002QBE0RU,"This is a fantastic series. Don't let the fact that it is a ""Sub only"" stop you from picking it up. Awesome animation and excellent voice acting. The writing is spot on, creating an interesting update to the whole ""Goddess"" genre.

Great stuff. Glad to see it released in the US especially during these tough economic times.",1260489600,2,324,4.684210526315789
8377641,1,B002QBE0RU,"It's a 14 Episode series that Bandai is releasing in 7 eps at a time.
It's over priced,  this is a subtitle only and the only possible plus
is the lower compression then the import [...]. for half the series
dubbed i could see. This is just overpriced. Not as bad as Hayate the Combat Butler but overpriced. What little i could see of the free episode from Bandai
the subtitles are about the same, maybe they improve later but i couldn't
tell from the little i was able to see.  I enjoyed the series and if it were
dub in English I'd buy it again. Mean while, Bandai continues to delayed the
release of it's dubbed titles to release these overpriced subtitle only dvd's.",1258588800,,670,4.352
