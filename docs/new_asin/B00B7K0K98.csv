5562205,1,B00B7K0K98,"I saw the remake Elijah Wood version.  I still give this one star.  I watch a lot of horror/suspense thrillers and this was one of my least favorite.  My husband had to wake me up a few times then I later had to wake him!  Yeah, I get it...a character study of a mentally ill man.  Yes, it's gruesome. Nothing impressive here, IMO.  I was not particularly impressed with Elijah Wood.  He was OK, but not anything special.  Overall, a disappointment.  Save your money and watch it when it's on Starz.",1372464000,5,499,4.395604395604396
5562206,4,B00B7K0K98,"I remember watching Maniac.  I remember looking at the cover and being intrigued yet frighten by the artwork.  For a couple years during my early life as a young teen, I was afraid of staring directly at this particular VHS cover.  I would walk around and around the local video store, developing enough courage to finally look at the box.  Taking in the imagery while reading the synopsis I would finally decide to rent it.  I remember not having much of a opinion after watching the film except... that it was so much different than any other horror or slasher film that I saw up to that point.

Just something about it.  The psychology of the movie, how sad and disturbed the killer seemed.  The scenes of violence throughout the film.  The sense of confusion and intrigue I was left after watching the film to completion.  At the very least it was certainly different.  Now, as a 30 year old man, after watching this 2013 remake of a 1980 film, I feel the same exact feeling I had when I watched the original all those years ago.  So what does this mean?  It means this remake is a successful retelling of the original.

Elijah Wood as Frank Zito is somewhat a different character than the 1980 Frank but it works.  It would never occur to me to even cast him for this role but I'm glad they did.  Having this movie take place primarily in first person view is terrifying but not in the sense that you are watching this predator hunting these unfortunate young women but during the moments when Frank is left alone with nothing but his thoughts and fears.  You can see that he is truly a poor and lost soul trying to be somewhat of a decent human being but constantly losing to his dark side.  At times you can even feel pity or even sadness for this character's plight and wish that he can someday find happiness.  During the scenes where we can see Frank in a mirror or in a rare third person view, his look is so similar to the Frank Zito of the 1980 film that you can't help but admire the work that was put into this remake.

From the practical effects (thanks to Greg Nicotero) to the amazing of the cast of this film (Nora Arnezeder is amazing as Anna), I cannot recommend this film enough to any horror movie enthusiast or just somebody who is up for a thoughtful look in to the mind of a maniac.  However, be forewarned, this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart.",1372464000,3,2386,4.365079365079365

5562210,4,B00B7K0K98,"this movie I just downloaded it wanting to see the film Maniac starring Elijah Wood, instead the movie was linked to a film called manic. I want my money back. The rating is not for the film, but for Amazon messing up the root link to the wrong film.

UPDATE 6/24/13***

I finally got to see the film. I must say, I was highly impressed by this re imagining of the 80's slasher film Maniac! The big twist in this is that we get to see everything as Frank Zito experiences his urges to kill. Now let me say I am a super fan of the original Maniac Directed By William Lustig, and to see Blue Underground as a part of this helped to certify this was approved. Now onto the review.

We meet Frank Zito, a young but really seriously mental character who has serious mommy issues. It seems his favorite pastime is scalping women after killing them, to save for his ""collection"". He wants to take them home, so they can never go away. He meets a photographer and the two seems to get close. But in inhibiting his urge to kill to feed his sickness, he starts to lose grip with himself and reality. To see it through the killer's eyes, in my opinion is what sets this film apart even from today's modern horror films. We hear his thoughts, we see what he sees, so we even in a sense feel what he is feeling, and let me tell you, it's maddening what is going on in poor Frank's head. He just can't seem to keep it together.

Without giving too much away, any horror fan who appreciates a bit of a character study on film, to go along with your horror this film is for you. Very intelligent, beautiful cinematography and some of the most haunting and violent films made today, Elijah Wood as the titluar character adds his own flair to the Frank Zito character, and does not steal from the more infamous Joe Spinell's take on how Frank is. I feel that this film compliments the original release in many ways, and it definitely sets it apart from other horror films this year.",1371772800,5,1964,4.3
5562211,5,B00B7K0K98,"I wish I read the reviews before I rented this. This is not the movie that is advertised in the title.

Edit:

The mixup has been FIXED so I was able to see the movie. Now to fix my rating with a proper review.  This is a definite 5 star horror movie in my book.

The POV camera for the stalking/killing is very jarring (harkening back to the opening scene of Halloween). Paired with the somewhat retro soundtrack it gives a nostalgic feeling for old style slasher movies in a modern setting, and I think the movie itself is a solid entry into that genre. The violence in the movie is VERY graphic (and it does not shy away from it using quick cuts or other camera tricks), so gauge your own stomach before watching, but it is worth it in my opinion.

Like I said, definite 5 star on the movie.",1371772800,14,794,4.197368421052632

5562220,5,B00B7K0K98,"Finally I got to see Maniac (2012) and what a piece of art it is. Such a beautiful looking film and what an inspired choice to put Elijah Wood in as Frank. A lot of serial killers are harmless looking types that blend into the background unlike a Joe Spinell type that stands out and immediately draws suspicion. I'm not that familiar with Elijah Wood and although I know he's a popular actor he looks almost childlike.

 This movie got a fair bit of hype within the horror community and I always thought it couldn't possibly live up to it but it's one of the best psychological horrors I've ever seen. The soundtrack fitted the movie perfectly too. Such an intense film at one point I had to stop it just for a breather, right after the chilling murder of the chick with the tatts. I think the whole POV thing aids this in that you feel like you're right there in the movie. I certainly can't remember the last movie I had such a physical reaction to, probably Irreversible.

 It kind of felt like there were a few different movies in one here it seemed to change tack when the absolutely stunning Nora Arnezeder appeared on the scene and you almost felt like this could be Frank's ticket out of his spiralling madness. Maybe just maybe he could put all this scalping business behind him, a beautiful woman also fascinated by mannequins literally appears at his doorstep but unfortunately his demons won out. I felt sick watching him attack her even though you knew it was coming.

5562223,2,B00B7K0K98,"Don't get me wrong! I like when movies are trying to give us something different but I don't think that it worked on this one. The first Maniac (1980) was a great dark hardcore slasher classic about a crazy man that is killing women to make some mannequins out of them so he can please his dead mother with the ""perfect"" woman. Joe Spinell was SOOO overly creepy as the maniac and the gory effects by Tom Savini were superb!

This remake was shot in first person view for most of the time and Elijah Wood as the maniac was a poor casting choice. Elijah is not creepy or intimidating enough for the role and the first person view just doesn't fit with a remake of Maniac, maybe with Friday the 13 or Sleepaway Camp but not with Maniac.

Maybe if this movie was an original film instead of a remake I would give it more credit. I just didn't liked this new vision over the original.",1446681600,,880,4.263473053892215

5562225,5,B00B7K0K98,"Now this is an example of a remake done right, keeps some of the spirit of the original but changes things enough that it stands on its own. Elijah Wood was great in this film, his performance was simply captivating. The gore effects & kills are very brutal. Its shot in a POV style so we see things through the eyes of the killer, no cut away during the kills because the killer wouldn't look away. The victims are also shown in a sympathetic light that makes the viewer feel bad for them when the time finally comes. Seeing the killer going out of his mind was also good thanks to Elijah's acting. The entire cast I feel did great, its co written by Alexandre Aja whos no stranger to the horror genre. The direction for the film is also very good.

5562234,4,B00B7K0K98,"The movie's acting, creepy musical score, and UN-annoying use of first person camera work keep this at a stable 4.  Seriously, that music had me reliving those 80's horror flicks and looking over my shoulder.  Elijah's main character acting and that music marry so well, it is frightening.

Maniac is a twisted, bloody, disturbing trip through the mind of a maniacal killer (and about a week of his revolting life).  Elijah Wood is definitely not ever going to be type-cast after this weirdo flick.  Frodo is very naughty in this movie.  So naughty that Sauron turned to me and said, ""Whoa, this is getting out of hand.""  And that was about a quarter of the way through this movie.  If you can stand to see it through, you are going to get some really scary and mentally-scarring scenes stuck in your head.

The movie does a good job of putting you in the killer's head, immersing you in his point of view.  Not a pleasant experience, but an interesting one.  If you enjoy murder movies, slasher thrillers, and realistic horror--this is your movie.  The killer is well-understood by the end, but holy crap are you going to be eyeing familiar faces differently after this movie.

Bloody, cringe-worthy, and totally plausible--Maniac is a good movie.  But evil.  Yeah, kinda evil.

5562245,5,B00B7K0K98,"NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!

As a fan of 80's music and movies, I'm not usually one to enjoy modern remakes. This is one of the rare exceptions when the remake is better than the original. The new soundtrack is terrifically haunting. This version seems to give Frank a more clearly defined reason for his mania. The story is pretty tight. Since early 1980's New York wasn't an option this time, modern Los Angeles was a great choice of location. Other than one chase that took several minutes and followed a victim through multiple locations with absolutely no one else around, the story was believably scary.

You might not wonder who will live and who will die, but there was plenty of suspense here. Knowing serial killers still exist and one maniac could be responsible for this much death is really frightening.

I'm not sure if Frank is supposed to be sympathetic, but suspect he is. I didn't want him to succeed and was curious to see how faithfully this movie's ending would mirror the original. I won't say here how this one ends, but it was an appropriate ending.

If you don't mind watching an extremely violent and intense horror movie, give this one a try. You may decide you don't want to watch it the whole way through. That's perfectly understandable. I'd be more concerned if this one didn't unsettle or disturb you.",1417564800,,1328,4.662393162393163

5562251,3,B00B7K0K98,"I remember seeing the original, late night showing at a theater. It was the only theater I think in the whole state
that was showing this film, and only at night.
I had heard a lot of talk that it was like nothing ever seen.

Early in the film, Frank (Joe Spinell), who's character we don't know yet, stalks a young couple leaving a club and
follows them in his car to a secluded park in New York.
Out of the blue, and totally unexpected, Frank, with shotgun in hand, jumps on the couples parked car hood and
blows the guy's (played by Savini) head off in slow motion.
I nearly fell out of my seat, and my blood pressure flew off the scale.

I was expecting ( like every other film I had seen) them to quickly cut just before the blast, but no, you see it up close,
in slow motion, with very graphic realism.
After dispatching the guy, Frank levels the shotgun at the blood splattered girl, and I was now expecting to see another
head explode, but this time, they cut.

With that introduction to the film, I knew I was in for a real ride. This film meant business, and anything can happen, which
kept my anticipation up high through the whole movie.

Now, on to this modern remake.
This effort pales compared with the original.
It's to ""clean"", lacks the grainy, gritty grunge, it's over-written, over-produced, and a bit to stylish.

Elijah Wood is horribly mis-cast as Frank. He is small, skinny, and fragile looking. I understand what the director had in mind
when casting Wood because I read his interviews. He was looking for a sort of, reverse psychology. Wood appears to be a
likable, sweet young man, so having him be a twisted killer (in the directors view) made him all the more scary).

Well, this idea could work, but it doesnt here. Wood is just too small to subdue a women and tie her up.
You need to have the right character body to make this believable.

Joe Spinell, a large guy, fatty chest complete with flabby 'man boobs', pot marked face, and stringy black hair was absolutely
perfect. He was totally convincing as a sick and twisted killer.
He was 'scary'!!

There is not a single moment in this remake that got my adrenalin up. The violence looked to ""clean"", not much blood, where
they should be lots of it.

It's over-written, so many flashbacks and references to his childhood life with his Mother looses it's impact.
As does the manikins motif . Over used to the point that it loses its creepiness.

The ending lacks the creepy, punch in the gut, that the original had.
And the idea of revealing Franks face as a manikin was just too formulaic and dumb.

Check out the original 1980 film, if you haven't already.
Its much better",1412035200,3,2655,4.453608247422681
5562252,3,B00B7K0K98,"Note: Australian review and ***SPOILER ALERT***

I approached this film with some trepidation, having seen the original film of the same name. However, equally, I was intrigued Elijah Wood was cast as the lead, with a supporting cast I had not heard of.

This film is beautifully shot. It looks exquisite, which adds to the creepiness and the establishment of the suspense is very well achieved. I also liked the background, in which Wood plays the reclusive heir of an antique mannequin restoration business.

The technique of seeing the action play out through Woods eyes, and hearing his inner dialogue, is quite original and works well for this genre.
The crimes committed by Woods character, without giving anything away, are worthy of the R rating given this film by the Australian film censors. The crimes are abrupt, awful, and escalate as the story progresses, which I though was an excellent touch (so to speak).

I cannot emphasize enough just how remarkable are the production values of this film  there is an awful lot of talent on display here, including during the crimes committed.

The casting is excellent, with the very distinct characters inhabiting this world established as completely three-dimensional in a remarkably short space of time.

The main supporting actor is Nora Arnezeder who is like the other actors perfectly cast. Both main actors have a genuine chemistry and their speaking parts are entirely believable, in terms of what they say in relation to what they are supposed to be in the film.

Arnezeder definitely adds a lot of onscreen charisma and beauty to the film  which doesnt go astray  quite apart from being perhaps the key other actor in the film and giving a flawless performance.

I felt while watching that some of the dialogue was a little obvious, perhaps unnecessary, and could have been even sparser than it was, which it seemed to me detracted ever so slightly from the very high standards the film had set up.

One of the key sequences is when Arnezeders character realises who Frank really is  the shock and anxiety this realisation registers on her face is wonderfully achieved  you genuinely feel you are in the room with her trying to escape Frank who has a bit of a Jeckle and Hyde personality, to say the least.

One of the references that I picked up, and perhaps I am reading too much into this, seemed to be Wood injecting some of the visual tics that he had used as Frodo in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy  to great effect.

The dialogue is also sparse and leaves a lot to ones imagination (a big plus). The plot really is all about who Woods character (Frank) is going to skewer next, which is a little unsatisfactory as this substantially guts (sorry, pun intended) any narrative arc that was established.

I liked some of the touches such as the use of a particular piece of music that was used previously in one of the seminal scenes in Silence of the Lambs when Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) is dancing around in his lair fully made up, having tucked his wedding tackle out of sight.

There is also the obvious reference to Red Dragon and Psycho, in the idea of a demented individual haunted and driven to frenzied crimes through a rather unhealthy attachment to their now dead mother.

Some of the story, I felt, was less successful. The scenes involving flashbacks of Franks mother in various compromising positions were less than perfectly realised and a little too obvious a device, as well as not really being clear enough as to what each incident amounted to. Was the mother promiscuous? Was she a sex worker? Either way, simply putting such visual examples in the film, on their own, without any exploration of the mothers relationship to Frank as a young boy who witnesses these scenes, seemed to me not to establish what (in terms of believability) has contributed to Frank running amuck in the present-day.

Great thought nevertheless was given by the production team to the look of each scene  the exterior shots, the interior of Franks shop, the interior of the apartments of the various rather unfortunate ladies Frank interacts with during the course of the film.

This was not a big budget extravaganza, so it is a little unfair to point the finger too much at this film. Much of tremendous impact has been achieved.

One thing, however, as someone who delves into this genre from time to time, is the lack of explanation as to why Frank does away with the particular individuals that he does. The plot device, that he wants the hair for his mannequins to wear, is not enough.

The great films referenced stylistically or musically in the course of this film are used to suggest by association what has driven the main protagonist to act out whatever is their particular gruesome fetish.

From what I know of serial killers, having read a bit of the literature on this uplifting subject, the established killers, for want of a better way of putting it, act according to some internal clock or urge that sets the pattern or characteristics that may lead to a reliable profile being established.
However, in this film there is no explanation of, for example, what critical set of events started Frank on such a decline, nothing is presented that adequately tells the tale. Nor are we given any real clues as to why Frank selects the victims that he does or why, for example, he tends to bring out the blade in a domestic setting.

There are, in that respect, aspects that do not enable one to suspend disbelief. People have smartphones. There may be CCTV cameras around. Most significantly, there is blood splatter analysis and DNA evidence.

Franks crude method of despatching his victims would mean a fountain of blood would be involved. He would literally be covered in it given the frenzied nature of his crimes. Yet, after one such sequence, I counted three minor smears of blood on his face. Frank gets home without anyone having heard or witnessed several of his crimes, nor his state of attire, in the wake of his rampage.

The ending of the film was a little difficult to follow, and seemed to be tacked onto the end to just wrap things up. It felt like the film was a vehicle for the major actors, at least in part, and the production team assumed that as some key sequences had been pulled off, the ending did not really matter that much.

The film definitely was successful in getting its hooks in, and the opening sequences suggested something unique and special, however, I think the production team perhaps should have thought more about the internal logic of the film, and perhaps tried for more financing so some aspects could be delved into to provide a more satisfying film.

Nevertheless, there is still much in this film that will have one holding the hands over ones eyes, with some very memorable sequences that are beautifully realised, if that is the right way to put it...

I should also add that I found the first half of the film so utterly overwhelming that I switched to something less disturbing and came back to Maniac a day or so later. That may very well have affected my view as to how well the film worked overall. Those who manage watching the film in one sitting, I salute you.",1411862400,,7192,4.70597609561753

Whether or not movies are good are an opinion, one that everyone has and screams loudly. I like the film. The way its shot was wonderful and an absolute artform with how they managed to get every shot without ever showing the camera (and often it wasn't as simple as just having the actor look into the camera instead of into a mirror).

It was shot in downtown LA, so you can spot all sorts of landmarks in the background of the film.

Managed to catch the showing of this in Cinefamily, where the actors were present. It was interesting seeing just how tiny and blind Elijah Wood is in real life. This review isn't about that, but it put the film in a different perspective for me (and I was sitting behind his parents while squealing about how cute he was. Really awkward once I realized that.

5562260,4,B00B7K0K98,"The thoroughly unique feature of this film is that it's shot entirely from the first-person point of view of its cold-blooded protagonist. While many modern ""found footage"" horror films ape that perspective by having the viewer looking through a home video camera's lens, this movie uses an actual steadicam with legitimate lighting and media quality. So the shots are not constantly trembling in a faux vrit, but are gracefully executed like an actual film. When the viewer starts witnessing the killer's deranged hallucinations, the film becomes especially gripping. On this gimmick alone, I'm tempted to give the movie 5 stars, seeing as how it enlivens the entire experience to something special and different from almost every other movie ever made.

Otherwise, the movie is a solid ""grand guignol"" throwback film, which was more popular out of Europe in the '70s and '80s. Sprucing up the gory serial-killer story is a hodgepodge of psycho-sexual ideas. It's not fiendish enough to have just a murderer running around, but the movie also explores the dark motivations of his criminal behavior, including various sequences involving rape, torture and abuse too.

The film is not particularly scary nor deep, but that's not to say it's tame and stupid either. But I would say the film is must-watch for slasher fans as something entirely different from the usual fare.",1403136000,,1372,5.147982062780269

As a fan of the original, I was worried when I first heard that this movie was being made but as soon as I heard who was making it, I relaxed.  There's enough elements from the original to satisfy most fans and enough new elements to make it a good remake and not just a regurgitation of old material.  Elijah Wood does a great job in the lead role, despite being a slightly different kind of character than in the original.  More normal looking and smart, less obviously crazy and greasy.  All the necessary insanity and hang-ups are still there in the character and the POV camera angle does wonders for the suspense of the film and makes you really feel like you are there, or even the man himself.  The soundtrack is also marvelous and one of my favorite parts of the film.  The filmmakers paid plenty of homage to the original in the score alone.  Overall, unless you are an elitist when it comes to the original, you should enjoy this version.  It's a great compliment to the original cult classic film.

5562270,2,B00B7K0K98,"Maniac (Franck Khalfoun, 2012)

I have long been antipathetic to the work of Alexandre Aja; Haute Tension, his first film to get wide American releases, is an overrated, boring thriller with plot holes large enough for the nuclear mutants in his horrific The Hills Have Eyes remake to drag tourists through. Franck Khalfoun is Alexandre Aja (and Aja's partner Gregory Lavasseur)'s protege, and there are times when I think the servant is easily going to overshadow the master; 2007's P2 is an amusing if forgettable piece of fluff, but it's a hundred times better than any Aja-helmed film I've seen to date. Which gives you an idea of where I'm coming from when I saw Maniac start showing up on a number of Best of 2013 lists, including topping Dread Central's Best Horror Movies of the Year consensus. And, from my perspective, I was right; this isn't even as good as P2, though once again it's acres better than much of Aja's own offerings (Aja and Levasseur, as with P2, wrote the script and passed it off to Khalfoun).

Plot: Frank (Elijah Wood, once again trying to shed the lingering spectre of Frodo Baggins) is a mannequin restorer who has a thing for women's hairespecially when he's skinned it from their heads, scalp intact, and puts it on his mannequins. Yeah, he's got a few issues, examined in enough detail to be really creepy in flashbacks featuring Frank as a young boy (Eli Dupont in his first screen appearance) watching his mother (America Olivo from the recent remake of Friday the 13th), presumably a prostitute, plying her trade. (The whole psychology-of-the-killer thing here, as is often the case, is somewhat shockingly reactionary, pop psychology 101 without doing anything new or interesting, and it just feels tiresome.) Things get slightly more interesting when a lovely young artist named Anna (Safe House's Nora Arnezeder) notices some of Frank's creations in the window and asks if she could commission some of them for one of her upcoming shows. Frank has, shall we say, always had problems connecting with women on a human level (thus his mannequin obsessionthough that is not to say they don't talk back); perhaps Anna will be the one to break through?

Even if you've never seen the originaland I have started watching it maybe half a dozen times over the years and never made it past the twenty-minute markif you've seen a half-dozen slasher films at all, you know exactly where this is going, don't you? You should. The original film may have broken some sort of mold as far as the psychology of the killer blah blah blah (though I would call that highly arguable; this ground had been well-trod by giallo long before 1980), but even if you buy into that argument, the idea of a remake of it in 2012 is, well, pretty senseless. The saving graces here are the two principals (for most of the film, at least); Wood plays his role to the hilt, and Arnezeder comes off with the perfect blend of innocence and sexiness-in-passing to really put the chemical screws to Frank. Problem is, the script tears all that up and forces these square pegs into hexagonal holes in the last ten minutes-ish of the movie, because that is what plot demands. (And just forget about the last sequence. Turn the movie off about five minutes before the end and you'll have a better time with it than I did.) But still, those first eighty minutes are kind of good, if you think of them as a dramatic reading rather than a fully-formed movie. **",1395532800,,3457,4.729684908789387
5562271,5,B00B7K0K98,"First and foremost, Hollywood has always sucked since the dawn of it's day. Granted, great things have came from Hollywood, though they are few and far between, and lessoning as time goes on. Generally it all depends upon the right director, script writer, and of course the director/actor relationship amongst other things, but you get the point.

 Anyhow, Hollywood is a dead bloated whale that has washed up from sea. And it really chaps my hide that Hollywood is remaking all the classic low budget films built upon passion, and a drive to do what Hollywood, or anyone else for that matter, had the passion, imagination, or inspiration to do. The last thing we want is for the likes of Michael Bay to purchase the rights to everything that was good, and just, and noble in our memories of yesteryear. Or just horribly disturbing of course.

 And then to make matters worse, they decide to throw in easily recognizable faces into these movies which only serves to take
you out of the experience, because you are like,""Oh look, it's that guy from Honey I Shrunk The Kids"", and then it's over, the movie is ruined...

 Except this time. I am a HUGE fan of the original, it is Tom Savini sacred ground. One of the very best slasher films to come out of the 80's.
 This Hollywood remake as it turns out, retells the same exact story, but with different locations, and different girls. There are a few other changes that I won't mention, but in short, EVERYTHING here conforms to the universe that the original created.
 Aside of the script alterations, there was of course the new take on directing. A lot of this version of this film is shot in first person and it did not bother me in the least. I enjoy experimental directing, or styles in directing that are not often used. I think it worked great for this film, and with an added benefit. It helps you forget who the man who's eyes were are looking through is.
 It's no less than that Hobbit guy who actually does a wonderful job at capturing the vibe of the killer in the original version!
Another aspect I like about this is that Elijah is a major heart throb to many teenage girls, so it's great to see him in a role that should do the job in making them feel disturbed by him for a change. Same goes for Cosmopolis. I applaud you Mr. Cronenburg!

 Anyhow, some people may not like this, but as far as I am concerned, unless you are going to do a remake shot for shot like The Omen, then you need to do a remake like this.",1395273600,,2479,4.426373626373627

I made it about 30 or 40 minutes into this one before deciding it wasn't worth my time any more. Let me sum it up for you- see pretty girl, stalk and terrorize pretty girl, hack up pretty girl to add parts to the creepy mannequin collection. Throw in some very awkward sex scenes that are probably meant to be sexy with a touch of creepy and are instead just stomach churning. Oh, don't forget the beautiful photographer interested in photographing his restored antique mannequin collection. She doesn't realize he's a psychopath. I can only imagine it ruins the fledgling relationship between them when THAT comes out. I wouldn't know for sure, as I was too bored and disgusted to continue watching it. Elijah Wood wasn't bad, but this one is too predictable and stale to let him really shine.

This is a really well made film about a twisted psycho and his futile attempts to be a normal human being. It is very innovative in its camerawork (mostly seen from the killer's perspective) and in its unflinching portrayal of death and mutilation. Horrible things happen to pretty girls right in front of your eyes, and that's just all there is to it. This movie earned its NC-17 rating and I can see no way to prune it back to an R without basically remaking it all over again.

As for the remake part... the original was controversial for many of the same reasons this version is, but this one takes modern special effects and technology and implements a much more graphic and sordid account than the original was able to pull off.

First of all, it's directed in a really annoying fashion. Most of the camera work is from Wood's P.O.V. It just comes off as really obnoxious and distracting. It worked for the BBC comedy Peep Show. Here, not so much.

Secondly, Wood has the apparence of basically a homeless meth addict throughout the movie. Ok, he's crazy and forgets bath time, that's fine. What isn't fine, is that we're supposed to believe that he'd get time talking to any of the 8's and 9's tier of female that he does. He goes on a blind date with hands looking like he works mornings for the local fight club. Yet, has the shoulders of a web developer. He looks exactly like someone everyone owning a pair of high heels would try to avoid.. anywhere.

The events aren't believeable. He boards a subway train in the early morning. An attractive female departs her group of friends and boards the same train. This is a train where apparently we're supposed to believe only Elijah and the female are the only two people on the entire train. In a major metropolitan city.. you would find this happening nowhere. They exit the train and believe it or not.. on the next stop, they're the only two in the subway station! No security.. no cop.. no couple making out.. no homeless.. no musician playing for quarters. They play a dumb cat and mouse game for several minutes.. her screaming and such. They transition this bad stage play outside to an open air parking lot, where she screams bloody murder and still no other soul is to be found. She is eventually killed.. and with an investation already in progress (newspapers reading ""serial killer on the loose"") her friends no doubt informing police of her last whereabouts (standard investigation stuff) but apparently this subway station has no security footage? Anywhere? In a major metropolitan city?? Gee.. who could this mystery man beee? Pretty conveninent!

And then there's the hot blonde who takes him... to the mooovies! Yet has a boyfriend! Riiight. I know tons of hot females who ask out creepy guys that never smile, blink, shave, laugh or bathe to horror movies on friday nights! Her treat! She'll buy the popcorn! So dumb.

I have never seen a movie shot in first person, but this film did an excellent job of using it to their advantage. Like Holden Caufield of Catcher In The Rye, our narrator is flawed and we only see the world through his eyes. The main character, Frank, is disillusioned and sees his mother in increasingly sexual situations at random moments, although she is dead. We see her because Frank sees her. And at the end, the mannequins come to life as representations of the girls he murdered. We see them as alive because Frank does, but they simply are not real. The 1st person perspective really helped propel the idea that all is not well with Frank.
  Now onto what was wrong with Maniac. Although the movie was creatively shot, the characters fell flat. Why was Frank killing these women? Who was he? Why should we care? The movie immediately jumps into a hunt and we get no exposition. Granted, we probably shouldn't feel attached to a serial killer, or pity him, but if he is the main character, he must at least be likable. Instead, we were treated to a two dimensional Elijah Wood playing a sexually frustrated Elijah Wood. I for one was glad that he got what he deserved in the end.

5562293,3,B00B7K0K98,"MANIAC is the story of a crazy man. A maniac, if you will. Mentally ruined by a mother with, let's say, loose morals, Frank, our lead, spends most of his time restoring antique mannequins and the rest of his time struggling with lethal, sexual desires for women (and their hair). When Frank meets a young photographic artist named Anna, he tries to rise above his dark and disturbing fetish, but things don't look good.

The film, ostensibly, stars Elijah Wood, although he's on-screen for barely a tenth of the film. The bulk of the movie is told from Frank's POV as he struggles with headaches, sex, and his love of scalps. Although the story isn't terribly detailed, its refusal to spell everything out makes for an enticing psychological portrayal. Unfortunately, the POV filming ends up having the opposite of what I assume was its intended effect. Rather than drawing the viewer inside of Frank, enmeshing the audience in his thoughts and deeds, the POV perspective ends up distancing us from Frank. They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and we spend 95% of the film staring out those windows from the other direction. As a result, we don't see Frank's soul as much as we see the destruction the soul creates. This makes the film feel cold and half-done.

Saved from being a total loss by a strong score and some pretty convincing special effects, the movie has its moments (especially its final, brutal scene), but these feel more like teasing glimpses at what the film could've been had it allowed the viewer a better view of our title character.",1385251200,5,1562,4.717948717948718

I had no issues with the gore in the film. In fact, it was the only thing that kept me watching, as I was curious about how far they were willing to take the gore.

Shot in a unique first person style with only brief shots of Elijah's character the cinematography and camera technique helps to keep our interest throughout the 90 minute runtime.

The Bad
The first person perspective also lends a bit of frustration to the viewer. I want to step out at times and see more of Elijah's character but we are stuck in the first person view. It's also a bit frustrating to think that the maniac would get away with such brazen murders throughout the film.

The Ugly
There is a lot of ugly in this film. Some of the murder scenes seem a bit over the top in the gore department. I love a little slasher gore but in many scenes I feel like the director is just trying to get a reaction out of the viewer. The film works best when the gore is more subtle.

To chime in on the debate, this movie is similar, but very dissimilar from the original.  I would classify this as a re-boot versus a remake.

5562301,4,B00B7K0K98,"Franck Khalfoun's Maniac is a stylishly brutal horror film that wraps its bloody hands around your throat and never lets go. Khalfoun's remake centers around a serial killer with a fetish for scalps who is on the hunt. Frank is the withdrawn owner of a mannequin store, but his life changes when young artist Anna appears asking for his help with her new exhibition. As their friendship develops and Frank's obsession escalates, it becomes clear that she has unleashed a long-repressed compulsion to stalk and kill.

Directors like Khalfoun are the reason why I'm notoriously optimistic when it comes to remakes. Maniac proves that you can inject terrifying new life into a story that has already been told and why we should be more accepting of remakes rather than write them off the moment they are announced. Yes, most fail. However, when they succeed, we get a film like Maniac and man is it one hell of a ride.

The film's strongest element as well as Khalfoun's most surprising approach to the film was shooting it almost entirely in the point of view of Elijah Wood's character Frank -- putting the audience in the mind of the killer. This tactic was truly terrifying and a fantastic way to experience a horror film. You often just hear the heavy breathing of Frank as he stalks his victims and all you can see is his trembling bloody hands. By shooting a film this way the director traps the audience in the body of a killer almost forcing you to do these horrible things with the Maniac. It's such a different way to experience a horror film but it really pays off in the end. Typically what makes a horror film scary is not knowing where the killer is or which corner he could be around next but that's not the case with Maniac because we know exactly where he is at all times, adding an entirely new element to the film. Sometimes knowing exactly where the monster is can be more terrifying than not knowing at all and that was certainly the case with Maniac.

Elijah Wood's gritty performance as Frank is absolutely haunting and unforgettable. The fact that we rarely see his face speaks volumes as to how great of an actor he is. We often only see his face through a reflection in a mirror and because it's such a rare moment to actually see the killer, Wood uses every second to his advantage by showing the deep pain in his eyes.

The film is an absolute blast for anyone willing to take a seat behind the eyes of a Maniac and the final moments of the film are utterly jaw dropping as it all comes crashing down in front of a few blood soaked mannequins.

Maniac (2012) **
D: Franck Khalfon
C: Elijah Wood, Nora Arnezeder, Genevieve Alexandra, Jan Broberg Felt, Megan M. Duffy, Liane Balaban, Joshua De La Garza, America Olivo, Sammi Rotibi
P: Homicidal maniac (Wood) who works in mannequin restoration by day, kills & scalps women by night.

I'm going to be perfectly honest, I strongly dislike the original 1980 version of Maniac. However, I went into this version with an open mind. The problem with this version, as was the problem with the 1980 version, is that the characters lack depth. Elijah Wood kills, because he had a messed up childhood and everyone else is just a potential victim. The POV aspect allows us to see what exactly is going on inside his head at any given moment, but it doesn't help to convey the character's back story or what he is thinking at any given moment.

To the film's credit, it is impeccably well made. Elijah Wood turns in a solid performance. Nora Arnezeder is a breath of fresh air, but it's all rather bland, despite the ample amount of violence on screen. Despite my dislike of the 1980 version, it was a rather memorable film. Joe Spinell, who played the original title character, is quite a character in and of himself. Plus, the scene where Tom Savini's head is blown off in the original version stands out as one of the most shocking horror movie moments of the 80's. The original Maniac was a lot of different things to a lot of different audiences. Some loved the film, some loathed it, but one thing was clear, it certainly stood out. Even with solid production values & performances, even with a relentless amount of on screen violence, this version of Maniac is rather forgettable and that's one thing the original wasn't.

5562309,4,B00B7K0K98,"This movie is hard to rate. It is odd, disturbing, extremely violent and sort of gives you a feeling of discomfort throughout the film. Don't go into this movie comparing it to the original ""Maniac"" or other horror films. Simply take this as a completely new horror suspense thriller and just enjoy it, or try to.

The entire film is as seen through the eyes of Frank (Elijah Wood), who owns a mannequin store which he got from his mother. The only time you see his character is when he is looking in something reflective, his dreams, a picture or when he is killing someone he sort floats outside his body and can see himself preforming these horrible acts.

This movie is very violent, has nudity and a some swearing. It is dark, gritty and unnerving. The PQ is decent for the over-all effect that they were going for. The audio is okay and the extras are what you would expect from a film like this.

Also, another thing to note is the cover art. While it is hideous, it is reversible and the other side is black with a nude mannequin, which I like a lot better than Elijah and the broken glass.

5562314,5,B00B7K0K98,"This is a radical trip of hard core violence and we walk in the maniac's shoes. Elijah Wood plays it just right. Toned down and self-programmed to wear a mask of sanity, he is lives in a secret world of manikins. When he does venture out into our world we see what he sees and there is almost a smooth and sweet quality to the character. As we inhabit his body, it becomes clear the character has a limited time before the mask drops off and his true nature breaks free with ferocity.

The first act of violence is wild and I wondered if this was  going to be a film with a  repetitive feel, if it was going to be just a body count. But, the character just gets crazier and weirder and each killing is more shocking than the last.  There is no speed limit here. When a bitchy agent picks at his peculiarity, she is oblivious to his dark side and laughs at him, forgetting that sometimes the old adage is true- if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all. Her horrible fate is cued by ""Ave Maria"",  filmdom's favorite music-to-murder-by . It the single best pairing EVER of opera and gore.

Hands down the best serial killer horror movie in a decade. But, I'm warning you now- I can watch anything in this genre and this one had me holding my hands in front of my face and glancing through my fingers, just to steel myself against what was coming next.

Directed by Franck Khalfoun (""P2"" ""Wrong Turn at Tahoe"") and co-written by Alexandre ""High Tension"" Aja (with Grgory Levasseur), ""Maniac"" manages to create some stomach churning moments, thanks to the blood and gore special effects, but not much suspense because of the uninspired direction heavily reliant on the gimmicky narrative.

What is really impressive about the remake is the nice, Giorgio Moroder-like soundtrack music that is worth listening to, even if you are not particularly interested in horror genre.

5562330,5,B00B7K0K98,"So, I always wanted to see the original Maniac from the 1980's but never seemed to get around to watching it. Then I heard about this updated version of the film and was intrigued. I never paid much attention to Elijah's career, but this performance allowed me to stand up and take notice of him and his talent. Elijah has normally come across as an innocent soul in most of his roles. Of course, there are the exceptions (Sin City comes to mind), but he usually portrays ""the boy next door"" type. He's got the youthful looks with a charming wit and knowledge on some topics that makes him seem older. Those normal characteristics are gone and replaced with something that's a cross between sinister and injured Psyche when it comes to the role of Frank. And Wood delivers successfully.

I honestly only have one problem with the movie and it really isn't even a major thing. While I love the POV shooting, I really longed to see more of Wood (of course, that's just the immature ""fan girl"" part of me speaking there). We are privy to seeing him during a few intricate moments (the parking lot scene comes to mind) and allowing us to see him during moments like that really help in us getting to know this killer even more (the euphoric look he has during the parking lot scene is both insightful and disturbing).

For Frank, there is a method to his madness and it's something that he struggles with on a daily basis. You get a sense that this character wants for a normal life but knows it's something he's not meant to have due to an unfortunate back-story that he never worked through. I found moments that I felt sorry for him and then minutes later I'd want to see justice served for the horrible murders he was committing. Once he met the female photographer (the character name escapes me at the moment), you get the feeling immediately that Frank views her as something more than another woman to kill. As naive as it sounds, I found myself wanting the characters to find happiness with each other even though I knew the possibilities of that happening were slim to none.

I do have to point out that the soundtrack is brilliant. I'm normally very picky when it comes to scores for films, but I found myself immediately loving the music right from the beginning. And let me just say that once you hear ""Goodbye Horses"" playing, the scene from this film will replace the scene from Silence of the Lambs that flashes through your mind whenever you hear it from now on.

It's safe to say that Maniac will join my horror movie collection. It's also safe to say that I will definitely be keeping a closer eye on Elijah Wood's career because the man now has me hooked!",1373068800,,2671,4.5010309278350515

8563637,5,B00B7K0K98,"As I have been a die hard fan of the original 1980 version by William Lustig, I was both excited about this remake and highly skeptical at the same time.  I was worried that too much would be changed about the story or the characters or that this would just be seriously mediocre and forgettable.  Some horror remakes are horrible and don't respect their source material, give the audience too much unneccessary backstory info about the main character that ruins the mystery that made him/her scary, or they focus too much on the gore and body count that the characters and storytelling totally suffer for it.  Thankfully this horror remake in no way suffers from of any of those aforementioned horror remake issues.

For those that are wondering as to how this movie is different from the original well you can rest easy as the changes are truly minor.  Frank Zito(Elijah Wood) is much younger this time, Frank has mannequins because he owns a shop where it's his job to do restorations on them, more back info is given on Frank's mother, the way that he meets the beautiful Anna(Nora Arnezeder) is different, other than that a bit of updating of technology comes up.

The intensity of Frank's being Norman Bates like in that he is a mama's boy of whom never recovered emotionally from his mother's death.  Also his intense desire to murder women, scalp them, and affix their scalps to mannequins.  Frank's emotional detachment and inability to relate to other people still remains intact.  His stalking of sexy women still remains either from driving around or from charming them on the net.  Frank is still a psychotic schizo and a total emotional wreck.  Other than that Frank still remains a methodical serial killer with any tool necessary to carry it out.

The musical score by Robin Coudert is great in that it makes a great reference to the 80's with it's synth elements plus the music fits the darkly toned moods, the dark alleys, and the sinister as well as terrifying and suspenseful scenes in the movie.  Also there is a little bit of beautiful cheery  music as well.

The cinematography by Maxime Alexandre is perfect in that it showcases the dark and eerie side of L.A. at night in the alleys, in much of the neighborhoods, and when the lights are out, also there are some very beautiful shots of the day time that effectively go for the little bit of cheerfulness in this movie plus the false sense of security that the characters have.  The building interiors are very well lit and do a great job of showing the audience the differences between Frank's poor, gloomy, and depressing home versus the beautiful and lavish lifestyles of the more rich and well to do characters.

The gore is a work of genius that even reminds me alot of not only the brilliant gore that Tom""Sex Machine"" Savini was behind in the original movie but also any of Savini's gore effects for that  matter.  The gore effects in this movie are the most realistic looking that I have seen to date.

My most favorite kills are Frank sticking a knife up through the bottom of this one woman's head causing the knife to go right into her mouth and this one guy of whom Frank forcefully jams a knife right between this one guys lips.  Two great examples of the excellent kills that this movie has to offer.

The lighting is not only beautifully done with the interiors of peoples homes and in some of the alley and street corner shots, but also in some scenes to where the light would make certain scenes look decidedly beautiful from the ethereal and dream-like look that the lighting would give scenes such as the art exhibit scene for example.

Besides some 80's like music, this movie even payed one sweet homage to the 80's with for instance one person having synthesizers and tall punker boots in her home and there were several characters in passing with 80's looks with their hairstyles and clothing.  I realize that Punk rock is a late 70's thing but I know that there were some punk bands that crossed over into the 80's.

While there isn't alot of nudity, the nudity that this movie has is just superb.

Another great feature of this movie is the first person stalker camera perspective that is fondly reminiscent of Dario Argento's Giallo movies from the 60's and 70's.  Also, it brings to mind that same perspective in Friday the 13th.

Q. Lazzarus's awesome song Goodbye Horses appearing in the soundtrack and even better with a brand new mix of the rocking song really helps as well.  Especially as it fondly brings The Silence of the Lambs to mind.

Overall, this remake is a win win.  If you have seen the original and love it as much as I do or even if you have never seen the original, this movie still stands remarkably well on its own as well.  This version does remarkably well what few horror remakes can.  It takes everything that's great about the original, gives reference to not just the original but also the 80's as well, best of all besides perfectly adapting all that was great about the original it also updates it to the 21st century without overdoing it plus making the current ideas work so perfectly.  The musical score is also great at keeping the viewers ability to stay with all that goes on to get them invested.  The editing and pacing is so well done that this movie is never boring once.  Elijah Wood may not appear on the camera all of the time but his performance while not entirely as mind-blowing as the late great Joe Spinell's, he still carries the character of Frank Zito and the movie perfectly on his own merits.  Yes this movie is disturbing but it's so well done as was the original that it is a definite must see.  10 stars out of 10!!!",1505520000,5,5674,4.586719524281467
8563638,4,B00B7K0K98,"Really liked this remake of one of my favorite sleazy 1980s flicks. I definitely thought the soundtrack was a highlight. Elijah Wood also did a great job portraying a tortured killer. It was also an interesting choice to shoot almost the entire film from the Frank's point of view.

Definitely worth checking out if fan of intense slasher flicks.",1503532800,,346,4.864406779661017
