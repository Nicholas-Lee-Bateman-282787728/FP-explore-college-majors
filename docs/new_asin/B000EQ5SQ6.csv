8112872,4,B000EQ5SQ6,"Okay KISS was & still is one of the
best live band even though Ace &
Peter are gone again but still rock.
Tommy Thayer who has been in the
KISS camp for years has earned
his stripes & it's time for him
to show is stuff. If anyone says
they don't like him they are crazy.
He is Ace's double & actually plays
Ace's parts perfect & better than
Ace is that's possible. It's like
watching a clone! Eric Singer is
back behind the drums & plays his
part well as always. I don't know
if I like them wearing the same
makeup cause it doesn't let them
express themselves by putting on
the cat & spaceman. Those were
other guys not them but glad
to see them continue & do it
well. I think the dvd is great
& sounds like no overdubs on
vocals this time cause Paul
& Gene sound a little raw but
that's even better since I have
many bootlegs & they sound like
they do live. If you are a KISS
fan & don't have it get it.",1241568000,,904,3.891891891891892
