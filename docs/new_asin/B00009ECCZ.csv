8318031,1,B00009ECCZ,"I am sorry but this product is way under any average production to be sold in amazon. It is a decent trip cronicle but definitively an amateur job not worth the price. The presentation is also poor, the DVD printing and the DVD cover.

Camera is mostly done on hand, image very very grainy, shaky, the music too loud and not appropiate in many instances, the direct sound is bad. I did this job some years before as  family videos to remember some trips but never to be sold. If no tripod available you can't make but wide shots supporting yourself on walls, stones, cars and so on.

Sorry again but the truth is the only way to improve things.",1109808000,5,644,4.35
