8471508,4,B005GEXARA,I would love to give this movie five stars however for me its a four star but for my son its a five star! We rented this movie at the Redbox and he absolutely loved it therefore i decided to check Amazon and of course Amazon never fails and we now own this DVD. Even thought it was shipped internationally we still received it in an ample amount of time.,1382400000,,354,4.071428571428571
