2325673,4,B0009VY0OM,"The first xXx with Vin diesel was better than this one, but this was was ok. I'd give this movie 4 and a half stars and the first 5 stars. I would buy this DVD, but If you don't have the first one with Vin Diesel get that one first, The Uncensored Unrated Director's Cut one. Ice Cube was ok in this classic or near classic movie, but Vin the man Diesel was better.

I hope they make another xXx movie, but none of them will be as good as Vin Diesel's. g2g and buy Vin Diesel's first, but you should already have it on DVD cause it's 3 yrs old, so buy Ice Cubes xXx - State of the Union.",1121904000,,587,3.8512396694214877

2325675,2,B0009VY0OM,"When will Hollywood learn, is a question many people have often asked regarding numerous choices Hollywood has made in regards to movie franchises.  For instance, when will Hollywood learn that some movies should never have sequels, or some sequels should only be made if it can surpass the quality of the original?  Another question is, when will Hollywood learn that when the star and director of a film does not want to return for the sequel because the material is not as good as the original film's, is a bad sign and that the sequel should not be made.  That last question for Hollywood is perfectly applicable to ""xXx: State of the Union"" or ""xXx 2: The Next Level"" as it was called at one point and may have been the working title in some areas.

""xXx: State of the Union"", as it was called here in the states, does not follow the further adventures of C.I.A. special `xXx' agent Xander Cage, after the original film's star Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen decided to leave the film after the script was completed.  Leaving the studio with the task of finding a new lead actor/actress to take over as the next `xXx'.  Which is how ""xXx: State of the Union"" begins, after an attack on a C.I.A. compound, C.I.A. agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson reprising his role) sets out to recruit a new `xXx' to take the place of Xander Cage who apparently has been murdered, though this is never seen on camera so it seems the studio is holding out hope that Vin Diesel will change his mind and appear in ""xXx 3"" if it ever gets made.  In his search, Gibbons decides that he doesn't have the time or luxury of testing his new candidate, instead he only chooses from one man, Darius Stone (Ice Cube).  Stone is a former military man that worked with Gibbons and staged a revolt against a general (Wilem Dafoe, who appears to be sleeping through his role as the villain here), the same general also happens to be Secretary of Defense and is behind the attack on the C.I.A. as a part of his plan to replace the President of the United States, whom he feels makes the U.S. look weak to our enemies.  When Gibbons and several other key members that run the `xXx' program are abducted, Darius Stone must call in some ""special"" back-up to help him stop the revolution before it's too late.

Some film franchises can survive having new lead characters be in each film, or having the same lead characters but different actors playing them, while sadly other franchises cannot.  Some franchises that have made this work to some extent, are as follows:  `The Crow' franchise (some fans would disagree), `Batman' franchise (at least until ""Batman & Robin""), and of course the most successful would be `007'.  However, the success that these film franchises have enjoyed through all the changes, was not to be shared by the `xXx' franchise.  Lets face it, Ice Cube is not Vin Diesel, the story was not nearly as good, the special effects didn't even look that good, and the directing was not the best.  I'm not saying the Rob Cohen is the best director, but Lee Tomahori should have done better.  My reason for saying Lee Tomahori should have done better, is because his previous film was the superb entry into the `James Bond' series with, ""007: Die Another Day"".  To go from what is one of the best `Bond' films to this crap is shocking, what was he thinking.  I mean the first sign as I said before that this film should have been avoided was the fact that Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen both passed on it, I wonder if Lee Tomahori even read the script before agreeing to make the movie.

The `xXx' franchise showed promise with an enjoyable first film, however this lackluster sequel took away any interest in seeing any new versions of `xXx'.  The only way this franchise could get off the ground again, would be for Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen to return for ""xXx 3"", which based on the numbers this movie made at the box office is not looking too good, I see crappy Direct-to-DVD sequels in this franchise's future.  And these Direct-to-DVD sequels won't be as good as those of `The Crow' and `Prophecy' franchises.

""xXx: State of the Union"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.",1121385600,2,4177,4.563587684069612

But when I saw the third film I found that I was missing a lot of background. Somehow, ""xxx"" became an organizational name.
So I rented this one. It didn't provide the background, but it turned out to be a very good sequel, in its own way perhaps as good as the original.
Of course, it has to be kept in mind that it is a very good /action film/. If you are looking for a serious drama, look elsewhere.
But if you are looking for an action film, this one'll do ya.
It also killed Xander off. I think that is probably the best way to look at it: Xander is dead, move on to the next guy.",1515369600,,660,3.9328358208955225

I cannot truly enjoy a movie with the top and the bottom cut off. I have heard that Widescreen is a way to see all of the movie

The movie is outstanding. The fantastic stunts, chases and the fact that the most unlikely bunch are the real Heroes....well if you

2325877,5,B0009VY0OM,"I saw this movie a few nights after I saw the original Triple X. I didn't like it enough at first, but I ended up purchasing the ICE CUBED triple feature DVD which contained this movie, GHOSTS OF MARS & ANACONDA. This movie takes place for the most part in Washington, D.C. Xander Cage obviously does not appear in this movie. Instead the film focuses on Darius Stone, an ex-Navy seal who becomes the new ""triple x"" government recruited by Augustus Stone, played by Samuel L. Jackson who reprises his role from the first Triple X. Willem Dafoe of SPIDER-MAN plays the villain, a general who wishes to overthrow the president of the united states in order to take over the government for himself. The action, while using too much CGI, is still pretty rousing and intense enough to earn a PG-13 rating. Scott Speedman also is featured in the movie as a government agent who aides Stone and Gibbons in the fight. Ice Cube is no Vin Diesel, but he is still a pretty effective action hero. Dafoe's villainous character is just as vile as the Green Goblin who he played in SPIDER-MAN. Bottom line: if you liked the first Triple X, then you will enjoy this one as well. but if you didn't like that one, then stop reading this review right here, right now.",1422748800,,1248,4.502202643171806

2325880,3,B0009VY0OM,"xXx: State of the Union  is a sequel to the 2002 film xXx. It was a disaster without Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen. Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen, the lead actor and director of the original had signed onto this film before xXx had opened, but both dropped out. Nevertheless,Cohen remained an executive producer. Actor/rapper Ice Cube takes over the lead role as the new xXx and Lee Tamahori was brought in to direct following the huge commercial success of the James Bond film Die Another Day which he directed. Unfortunately,Ice Cube and Lee Tamahori combo did not do anything well for the film as it became an uninteresting and an exercise of an implausible action film.

If you look at it being just a sequel to the first movie, I can understand one thinking it would suck, but if you look at it as any other action flick without the xXx name attached to it, maybe you might think differently.

Also, people complain about it being too unrealistic. Seriously, like the first movie was more realistic to begin with. Both movies are unrealistic, but if I was looking for realism, I wouldn't be watching movies like this.

It Had a decent story for that type of fantasy movie and was a decent a budget movie. That can't be said for this one however and Vin Diesel wisely stayed away from this really bad A movie.  It has alot of good actors in it who must have gone insane to appear in this flick.  If it were a bad b movie you could say: ""well that's what you get"" but this was a higher budget flick. It has a hero who convinces murderous gnngstas (these characters do exist in this movie ) to help him fight evil bad guys by telling them that what's good about this country is that you can still car jack (and kill innocent people) a block away from the capital building! Yes that's the mentality of this movie which aims to please fan's of  gangster crap rap. I am not saying that this means all rap is like gangsta rap lots of it are ok. but this movie embraces that gang rap mentality all the way,  and  this has nothing to do with anyones race either which some dude comment  claims that I mean. In fact it's  not too smart to assumes that anyone who objects to gangsta rap or movies that support that attitude hates people of color. I am presently dating a african american who HATES GANG RAP MUSIC and this movie too!  A bad movie is a bad movie and this is the only superagent movie that tries to shoot so low.  Or the only one that is this poorly written and dumb.

  It has stunts that are silly and weren't meant to be, like a car traveling down railroad tracks and of course it is a perfect fit as the wheels burn away!.  Samuel L jackson ,a man of some class, must have had a large house payment due to be in this travesty.
  The blu ray print is very good but nothing can save this thing from being the bad movie it is. The first xxx was mindless fun but this one was a  huge bomb for alot of good reasons.

2325933,2,B0009VY0OM,"I haven't seen the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/xXx/dp/B00005JL3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">xXx</a>&nbsp;but I'm doing my best not to be prejudiced by the lazy mediocrity that is its sequel. As big and competitive as the modern action/adventure genre is, ""State of the Union"" brings surprisingly little to the table, with promises of big fights, big guns, big shootouts, and big excitement left unfulfilled by a director (Lee Tamahori,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Another-Day/dp/B001EDVNNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Another Day</a>) who seems to have thought that simply putting rapper/actor Ice Cube into the starring role would be good enough to account for everything the film lacks. When judged against everything else that was and is on the market, ""Union"" brought a peashooter to a gunfight and was swiftly and rightfully forgotten by most folks.

The story: when the xXx program is infiltrated by an insurrectionist splinter faction headed by a corrupt general (Willem Dafoe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B00005JKCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>), a new agent is chosen in the form of an incarcerated Navy SEAL (Ice Cube,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Kings/dp/B002O3Z4Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Kings</a>). With aid from both new and returning allies, he must uncover the insurgents from within to thwart a plot to overthrow the US government and assassinate the president.

As I understand it, the original film's premise was to mix action with extreme sports. ""State of the Union"" has no such foundation. It's simply your run-of-the-mill ""gotta-stop-the-bad-guys"" take that has been done about a thousand times throughout cinema history. Absolutely nothing about the film stands out: no high-risk stunts, no extraordinary special effects, no revolutionary characters, nothing. I can't help but go on about how little and how bland of action the film has to show. There are approximately two hand-to-hand fights, about the same number of shootouts, a car chase or two, and a somewhat cool encounter between two tanks - the lot of them almost completely by the book. Ice Cube makes a decent (if somewhat stereotyped) action hero, but with so little to work with, he's got no chance to live up to Vin Diesel.

There's nothing much to fall back on: with the exception of the performance of Samuel Jackson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/1558908242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>), there's nothing beyond decent that Dafoe, Scott Speedman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B0000VAFO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>), Peter Strauss (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jericho-Mile/dp/6300151875/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jericho Mile</a>), Xzibit, or Nona Gaye (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ali/dp/B00005JKMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ali</a>) bring to the table, and there's no meaningful underlying message or even particularly good humor to divert our attention. While the movie is competently made, technically, it feels nothing short of toothless. Before the end of the first half, you'll have seen just about everything there is to see, and unless the producers choose both a different star and a more competent writer, there'll be little reason to look forward to for the inevitable ""xXx 3"".

Unless you're a fan of either Ice Cube, Xzibit, or a particularly diehard fan of Sam the Man, there'll be no need to pick up this poorly-conceived actioneer. The two stars you see at the top of this review acknowledge that the film was shot in English and was in focus; if I were basing my review on how memorable the flick was, it'd get less than one star.",1227484800,2,4021,6.653333333333333

2325937,1,B0009VY0OM,"My brother bought me this DVD as a gag gift.  I would have to say GAG fits my description of this movie very, very well.  Firstly I should note that I wasn't a huge fan of XXX with Vin Diesel, but it is an Oscar winner compared to XXX: State of the Union.  This movie was so ridiculous that it was down right funny.  There were times I was laughing so hard I had to excuse myself to the lavatory.

Now for some reason good old Vin was not in this sequel.  So who do we get to replace Vin?  Ice Cube, yes Ice Cube.  I don't know about anyone else, but it seemed like Ice Cube was lost this entire movie.  As for the physical action he wasn't bad, but he just seemed to dim witted to know what was going on in this ""want to be"" 24 storyline.

There were things also that made me laugh so hard I was in pain.  I also know that this wasn't the intention of the movie makers.  Also general observations I made about my reaction to this film....

1) The CGI was so obnoxious in this movie it looked like a Playstation game.
2) In (at least) one of the stunt scenes an action figure is used. (Remember motorboat).
3) Ice Cube quotes 2Pac in the movie, too bad he can't act as good as 2Pac.
4) Helicopters are silent right before you jump on one.
5) Ice Cube is released from jail to save the USA, but never gets a pardon.
6) Ice Cube is supposed to save the USA.
7) The editing in this movie is worst that an Ed Wood movie.
8) Ice Cube made Vin Diesel look like Tom Hanks or Morgan Freeman.
9) Has Samuel L. Jackson made another good movie besides Pulp Fiction and the Star Wars prequels?
10) The President of the United States' ""secret"" train runs juxtaposition to I-95 or some other public interstate.
11)  Ice Cube can jump off a train that is going 260 mph and fall over 100 feet and still dive perfectly into the water.
12)  Ice Cube was in prison for almost ten years but has no problem understanding high tech weapons in mere minutes.
13) This movie really wanted to be a 007 film or an episode of 24.
14) The movie was made to promote a soundtrack.
15) Street thugs led by Xzibit can take on USA military intelligence.
16) The CGI was so obnoxious in this movie it looked like a cartoon.

I could go on, but I won't.  This movie was just a poor excuse to cash in the XXX franchise, if there is even still a franchise after this bomb.  It was also a poor excuse to blow stuff up and make an action move.  Perhaps if this movie was just called State of the Union and no reference to XXX maybe it wouldn't have been so bad, nah.

As for entertainment, I had plenty of laughs watching this movie.  I thought this movie was going to be bad, but I had no idea how hideous it really was going to be.  Since Vin Diesel was the first XXX and Ice Cube was the second, maybe Tom Green can be the third.  In conclusion, Showgirls has more depth than XXX: State of the Union.",1199577600,4,2863,4.064171122994653
2325938,2,B0009VY0OM,"Watching Ice Cube play the hard guy would-be spy makes you realise - wow! Vin Diesel actually DID have charisma after all!

All pretensions to the part being about spying and stealth are out of the window - the first movie had an appeal of being like a Bond movie on steroids; This one is just action, and could be any action franchise a few movies in. In fact, in terms of substance this could easily have been direct to video for all the weight the star and story carry... however, there are bangs for your buck on display here.. the actions scenes are as big budget as they are ludicrous. The opening scene has some promise with Samuel Jackson taking on the bad guys in his own headquarters, but when he steps into the wierd custom job car you know there is a franchise identity crisis on the way - is this XXX or Fast and Furious 4??

In short, this is brainless action - budget is on the screen, but not with the script. Ice Cube plods through the role giving it no heart, panache, or even self knowing parody. Daniel Defoe and Samuel Jackson should know better.",1171411200,2,1067,4.33

Of course the plot makes no sense and there are a bunch of ridiculous explosions.  Again, what did you expect?

I could have lived my whole life without seeing this movie and I wouldn't have missed a thing, but I happened to catch it on TV, and it's now awful.  It is forgettable, but that's not the same thing.  The movie is filled with terrible dialog and predictable twists, but who cares?  They blow a lot of stuff up, and it will make you laugh--not at the intended jokes, of course--but at the fact that it seems to take itself seriously from time to time.  Plus, you have Jackson and Willem Dafoe mailing in their performances, and Ice Cube trying as hard as can be to NOT be tongue-in-cheek and failing miserably.

2325941,4,B0009VY0OM,"If you're expecting some big, deep, meaningful morality tale in ""XXX: State Of The Union"", look elsewhere. This movie doesn't pretend to be a deep psychological political thriller, like the 1962 version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was; it's a fast-paced action flick, and it makes no bones about it.

Rapper/actor Ice Cube is Darius Stone, a Navy Seal who was wrongly imprisoned when he fought a order from his commanding officer to kill innocent people in Kosovo. Stone's former C.O. is now the Secretary Of Defense, and he's got some plans for the nation which aren't too pleasant.

Once again, we have Samuel L. Jackson reprisiing his role as NSA Senior Agent Gibbons, the man who enables Stone to escape from prison after a team of masked (and heavily armed) men stage a raid on Gibbons's NSA headquarters in which several agents are killed. This isn't gonna sit too well with Gibbons, so he wants to know what's going on; hence the need for Stone to do the investigating, and do a bit of butt-kicking along the way.

Needless to say ... a lot of action, including some pretty good stunt work, is packed into the space of 101 minutes, and director Lee Tamahori, who's no stranger to the action movie genre (he directed ""Die Another Day"" and ""Along Came A Spider"" -- two other films which fit the ""popcorn action movie"" genre), and he does a pretty good job of keeping the movie going, even though the plot itself has holes which are big enough to fly a fleet of Blackhawks through.

It's also good to see some familiar faces in this movie, including Willem Dafoe as the Secretary of Defense, Scott Speedman (who's definitely come a long way from his days on the TV series ""Felicity"") as the NSA agent who always seems to be at least one step behind Stone, and rapper Xzibit turns in a good performance as Zeke, the chop-shop owner who's recruited into the fight to save the nation.

While ""XXX: State Of The Union"" isn't the world's greatest movie, the DVD has enough goodies to keep you interested, and it's a good companion to the unrated director's cut version of ""XXX"".

All in all, if you want a movie that's perfect to munch popcorn by, ""XXX: State Of The Union"" is your kind of movie.",1165795200,6,2197,4.591836734693878

Whither, Lee Tamahori? Whither?

Tamahori continues the long and undistinguished tradition of fantastic directors from overseas (in his native New Zealand, Tamahori was responsible for Once Were Warriors, one of the country's most beloved and enduring film exports) coming to Hollywood and making absolute [...] What's worse, Tamahori, screenwriter Simon Kinberg, and (mostly) producers Neal Moritz and Arne Scmidt, have taken the most promising spy movie franchise since James Bond burst onto the scene and have spared no expense grinding it into the dust.

Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) needs to recruit a new XXX after the old one decided not to renew his contract (probably after reading this dog of a screenplay). He pulls the lieutenant from his old unit, Darius Stone (Ice Cube), out of prison to help him overthrow one of their old nemeses, the current Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe), who's planning something nefarious.

Compared to the franchise's first film, this one's a pale shadow. Lots of things blow up again, but that's really the only similarity between the two. The character development, the sense of pace, the attempts at getting the viewer to identify with anyone at all in the film, all gone. This is a movie for people who like to watch stuff blow up, and don't care about anything else. A horrible, horrible disappointment. *",1147910400,6,1399,5.096069868995633

Movies aren't about reality they are for entertainment purposes only. If you want reality, try watching movies about dead actors or some other famous person. You could try watching the Discovery Channel. My point is, fiction movies are not to be taken literally. For example, the movie, She's All That, let's be realistic here, you would never find the most popular guy dating a geek. It doesn't happen. But the movie was still a good movie to me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion when you do state it, but bear in mind that action movies are just like any other movie, they are fiction. Personally, I thought the movie was a great action movie and in my opinion you've seen one action movie you have seen them all. There is your reality. Some may have more sex in it others may have more things blowing up. Here is what I say, don't listen to what others say about the movie, watch it yourself and form your own opinion.

2325947,2,B0009VY0OM,"If `XXX: State of the Union' is painfully bad, that is not because it has no coherent plot. Anyway you don't need it when you get good actions, interesting characters (hopefully with one-lines), and good supporting actors. The original `XXX' had all of them - extreme sports type actions with the hair-raising climax, super-macho Vin Diesel as likable hero Xander Cage, and beautiful and sexy Asia Argent.

So why did they make a sequel without them? No Diesel? No Asia? This must be a joke, and it turns out that way. Sam Jackson is back, yes, I admit, but his recent track record is not what it was when he was in `Pulp Fiction' and `Jackie Brown.' And the director is Lee Tanahori (no!) whose very inept direction in the latest 007 film is still a bad memory to me.

Probably you would think that you can write a better story after watching `XXX: State of the Union,' and probably you are right. Ice Cube is newly recruited from the prison by Samuel L. Jackson's Agent Gibbons, and Cube almost single-handedly prevents the sneering bad guy Willem Defoe from doing some terrible (but hardly credible) things in the most contrived way. When I say `single-handedly,' I do not exaggerate. Ice Cube jumps in the air from the wall, shoot rocket launchers, and chase the bullet train. Sometimes you can see him with sidekick Scott Speedman, and two `XXX' girls Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey, but basically Cube is the center of the film. Well, he is not bad.

What is really bad about the film is the over-the-top actions which overuse the special effects. As in `Die Another Day,' in which Tamahori did the same mistake, his excessive action set-pieces are always so big and loud that they often make it too obvious that the post-production work polished up the shots with fast-cut editing and CGIs. It is watching the screen of video games, where many explosions and car chases happen, but ultimately they are all tedious.

About eleven years ago, Tamahori impressed the world with his superb `Once Were Warriors.' Now he is doing `Along Came a Spider' `Die Another Day' and this one. But I'm not surprised seeing his recent career for this is a familiar story we all heard in Hollywood. And I'm not surprised either if someone is trying to make another `XXX' film.

But I thought XXX: State of the Union lived up to pretty much all of the anticipation that I was expecting. And to let you all this, I'm 20 years old ( so I'm a kid), but I definitely was a kid at heart and mind when I was watching this movie. The only real dissappointment of this movie is the fact that Vin Disel wasn't in it, he was the heart of this franchise. But I thought Ice Cube handled himself pretty well in this movie. But Disel is the reason this one didn't do so well, this was his franchise, and he threw it away to do ""The Chronicles of Riddick""  and ""The Pacifier"". Big mistake!!!  But still I did very much enjoyed this movie, and I've been hearing that even thought this one didn't do that well. Rob Cohen is still possibly considering a XXX3. But the XXX for the next movie might be a woman. If this does happen, and Rob Cohen might be reading this review may I make a suggestion for the female XXX. Kristana Loken.  Just think about it.

2325951,5,B0009VY0OM,"If you're going to make an action movie, think big; that's what I say.  XXX: State of the Union thinks big - and then some.  I'm not a huge fan of action films, but this one is truly the bee's knees (hey, I'm just trying to avoid saying ""This film is awesome"" here).  I don't really see how anyone could be disappointed in this thriller.  Is it realistic?  Well, no - but action movies are never realistic.  That's why they're called action movies and not documentaries.  And, actually, the basic scenario brought to life here might be more possible that many people think - you'll never count me among the crowds chanting ""It can't happen here.""  I'll admit, when I saw the film's PG-13 rating, I was a little wary.  PG-13 never bodes well for violence and explosions and bloodshed and general destructive mayhem, but the lack of an R rating turned out to be meaningless here - as there is plenty of stuff that goes boom throughout the entire film.

America loves an anti-hero, especially one with the unsurpassed attitude and general bad-a, uh, steel-plated ba-, uh unsurpassed self-confidence of Darius Stone (Ice Cube).  Nine years in a maximum-security prison, courtesy of a corrupt general now serving as Secretary of Defense, hasn't done anything to sugar-coat Stone's outlook on life.  (Of course, only civilians can serve as Secretary of Defense, but let's just pretend we don't know that; while we're at it, let's also pretend that said Secretary of Defense is in charge of Presidential security, since the Secret Service is nowhere to be found in this movie).  If you're NSA agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and your whole crew of good men has just been taken out by the most elite of attacks, Stone is just the kind of man you want on your team - and so it is that the good guys bust Stone out of prison to christen him the new XXX.  Many extremely expensive explosions, not to mention gunfights and hand-to-hand combat scenes, quickly follow.  There are a number of twists and turns along the way to the truth of the unprecedented plot playing out in the Beltway, but let's just say there are no locked doors as far as Stone is concerned.  He's a door-crasher from way back.  Maybe the elements of the final scenario are a little unrealistic, but I didn't care, since I was watching rather than analyzing the movie at the time.

Others may disagree, but I thought XXX: State of the Union was a great action movie; it had everything I want in this kind of thriller, and there's nothing more enjoyable than getting to the truth of a vast conspiracy - especially when the path is filled with as many explosions as the filmmakers can pack into 100 minutes.  It's true that a lot of innocent civilians and a fair share of good guys are killed in the process, but this is just a movie -a wildly entertaining one that I thoroughly enjoyed.",1130112000,2,2855,4.606719367588933

First, on the film itself, it isn't bad but it won't go down in history as a great action flick! The plot is a little more than paperthin. We pretty much know that Ice Cube and company is going to save the day.

As for the character, in Ice Cube's defense, WHAT'S SO FREAKIN' BAD?! He basically plays the same character in all the films he's in! Even the classic urban tale ""Boyz In The Hood"" and his role in the ""Friday"" series is not too much different. As for no regard for human life, DID YOU EVEN WATCH THE FILM!? It was a Presidential Bullet Train! How many people are going to be on it anyway!? Plus, they already knew who was on it. Check for passengers? PLEASE! Besides, not too many action flicks have a regard for human life in them!

As for racism, there was plenty of that but what did you expect with Ice Cube as the lead!? All of his films are like that!

Others may talk of declining box office, but I see a rosier picture when it appears that the audience is becoming more discerning.  Derivative action flicks like Stealth stumble out of the gate, and not long ago, the same happened with the sequel to XXX.

Subtitled ""State of the Union,"" XXX 2 is merely an excuse to watch things blow up.  There are the vestiges of a plot involving a coup attempt by the Secretary of Defense, but the story is merely an excuse to get from one silly incident to the next.  What's the most inane scene in this movie:  the ludicrous prison escape or the final battle sequence which involves the recruiting of a bunch of gang members who all apparently never do drugs and have a vague sense of patriotism?  There are probably a dozen other choices.

The intent of the original movie was to showcase extreme sports in a James Bond parody, and it was quite successful.  With Vin Diesel's replacement (a perpetually scowling Ice Cube) an ex-SEAL, we basically lose what made the first movie original.  Instead, we get a clichd action flick that has been done better dozens of times.

So maybe movie audiences are getting better at recognizing garbage when it comes out, and maybe that in turn will lead to better movies.  Yeah, right.",1125792000,25,1385,4.562753036437247

2325963,2,B0009VY0OM,"I remember the first XXX with Vin Diesel!!! Vin Diesel brought something to XXX, with the bad ass-fear nobody daredevil character, underworld feel-like the clubs and the russian gang/ terroist group, lots of action scenes with heavy metal blarring in the background!!! The original also had a more stable story and was put together, way better!!! Vin Diesel, was a way tougher XXX, than Ice Cube, face it!!! Damn, them for killing off Zhander (Vin Diesel)!!!

 Now, for State of the Union, a pathetic excuse of a sequel!!! Does anybody remember ""The Lost World"", directed by Steven Spielberg, the horrible sequel to the original ""Jurassic Park"", which was visualy awesome, but still fell short and failed!!! This is a pretty the same scenario, they made ""State of the Union"" too ploty, and focused too much worring about the story and less on straight forward action!!!

 At, the beginning you havethese teroist attack a secret NSA facilty, on a farm.... don't ask!!!So were meant to believe a bunch of terrroists were able to make it passed security without a trace, and slaughter the whole NSA facilty, without struggle!!!  Even, if the terroist was about 20 years advanced technolgy, the NSA would have lasted longer than only 5 minutes and would have better weapons, with way more advanced security along with commandos and probably government agents their too!!!

 If, the NSA knows and can tell you every detail on terroists, and is called the National Security Agency, trusted in keeping America safe, why is it that thaey can't secure themselves!!! Anyways, Gibson and the gaget man are the only two that escape!!! NSA agent led by (Scott Speedman), cut operations and search for Gibson suspecting he had something to do with it!!!

 Meanwhile, Gibson decides to call up a new XXX, a tougher one and Ice Cube being the choice!!! An ex soldiered court martialed for 20 years for disobeying and assaulting General Decker( the mastermind behind everything)!!! Gibson finally, convinces him to help him, they don't hae the best friendship in the world!!! Now they make it look easy to escape from fedral prision, as when the sniper has a shot and doesn't fire for some reason that is when I knew this was going to be a bad film!!! So they basically must figure out who is behind this and why, with a bunch of action scenes, and some sweet stunts!!! Gibson is supposely killed off easily, so the fate of the world lays on Ice Cube's shoulders!!!

 Ice Cube may act tougher but Vin Diesl and his stunts from the first movie, blow anything that this movie has to offer!!!

 Beyond that they replace, the heavy metal with ghetto music, and the story is shaky with ons and tons of plot holes and problems, with unexplained stuff so on and so forth!!! To sum it up Secretary of State Decker(William Defoe)/General Decker believes,that the goverment has grown weak and feels he must put the government back on track, by destroying the government, and bulding up their armies and such!!! He plans on assinating him during The State of the Union cermony!!!

 So he  basically works out a plan, that requires the price of blood, he's pretty muuch one of those world domination/ fame nut cases using fancy words!!! Yeah and nobody finds out about this, either and who knows where he gets the funding for all this either!!! Ice Cube aided by Xibit and his ""homies"" go breaking through the secruity lines around the White House in tricked out vechiles, with weapons, which we are also supposed to believe!!! Then Ice Cube and Gibson team up and together must save the country once and for all!!!

 Of course their are some great action scenes for example attacking The Aircraft carrier with a Bradley, but really how the hell am I supposed to believe that at all!!! Since the Abrams tank would have destroyed the Bradley instantly, playing us for a bunch of fools!!!

 The last part with the fight on the Presidental Bullet Train was pretty darn cool as well!!! The thing is this whole time they keep playing us for fools: they make the NSA seem whimpy, along with the army, make it look easy to escape from a fedral prison, and in the meantime Decker schemes are never discovered, until it's too late!!! This movie basically makes us Americans look like fools!!! This movie is only good for raw action, their are some pretty sweet gagets as well, with cooler cars!!!

 Hey, it's good to put a little imangination in the film, but besides that the movie is just weak the story is messed up and in all reality, the first XXX Zhander Kage(Vin Diesel) was 10,000 times better!!! Like, I said an sequel that fails to sastisfy, hopefully XXX 3 will be more like the first one, which was really good!!!

 Overall, I will give this 2.5/5...... failed to please, very disspointing!!! Do not buy this get the original instead!!!",1125014400,2,4810,4.7398081534772185
2325964,3,B0009VY0OM,"Everyone is way way way too hard on this movie. Sure there should've been no movie without Vin Diesel. But brace yourselves, I think this is a better movie than the last one. In that you had Vin sledding on snow from bad guys while annoying loud heavy metal played. That at least looked real though, most the action in here looks supper fake. Still they're still enjoyable and this isn't a bad movie to watch with some drunk buddies lol. Which might be why I enjoyed it haha.

  Soon after getting news that Xander (Vin Diesel) is dead they go out to find a new XXX. Then Samual L. Jackson of course says I know just the guy and he's has to be meaner, tougher and blah blah more than the last. Not sure if Ice Cube is all those things over Vin Diesel. Xzibitwho's in better shape than Cube looks better for the part. Instead he plays a sidekick to him basically.

  When Cube is strugging to fight William Dafoe, I was hoping Cube would die and Xzibit would just come in and win with one punch haha. But with all joking aside, Cube doesn't do that bad filling Diesel's shoes. Saying that he's the better XXX is a joke though. Scott Speedman (Dark Blue) also gives one of his better performances. He plays an agent who's after Cube but of course believes him after awhile and teams up with him. I'm not giving anything away, most the trailers make it clear that's what happens anyway.

  William Dafoe surprisingly does nothing for the movie though. He's noir bad or good in his role, he's...just there basically. He was much better as the Green Goblin in Spiderman though. He had great villain written all over him in that. This is probably his weakest time as a villian ever. Usually he proves to be dependable when you want a good villian. Plus Samual L. Jackson I think is more entertaining in the one. He sharpened up the role for himself this time around. When he tells Cube ""you should've killed the bitch, I told you, you should've killed the bitch!"" . I couldn't help laughing. In the first he pretty much was just a guy in a suit and was as flat as him playing a Jedi. Here at least he brings out some of his Pulp Fiction character. When the film ends it ends with him  saying, lets go meet the new XXX. And I say ""I wonder if it's Napoleon Dynamite"".

2. You're a liberal and don't believe Hollywood has an anti-conservative agenda

3. You're an idiot and need to feel smarter

I'm no genius and no liberal, so I fall into the third category. This movie is complete garbage. Force-fed political-driven plot (haven't we had enough of this?), crappy dialogue (no surprise), non-believable scenes.  There were a few redeeming qualities such as the cool gadgets and the fact Jackson can light up almost any movie no matter how stupid.  Just to be clear, I am a fan of Jackson's talents, just not a fan of his views and movie roles.

My favorite part of the movie was when computer boy hacks into NSA's security system within a couple seconds/minutes/hours.  I mean, come on.  We're talking about a security agency whose sole purpose is to protect National Security.  Key word here guys, ""Security"".  Not something you just waltz into. Not to mention he's able to find this ""needle in the haystack"" document while he's in there.

And almost always stars either Samuel Jackson (Rules of Engagement, Changing Lanes, Shaft, Die Hard III, The Negotiator, A Time to Kill) or Denzel Washington (Manchurian Candidate, Out of Time, John Q, The Siege, Crimson Tide, Ricochet). Why is this?  For the most part (of course there are exceptions), white folks would like to blur the lines between black and white.  As a white person, it becomes frustrating to constantly see your race labeled as evil/greedy/selfish, uncool, oblivious people.  This film just further proves my point...they're either:

Evil (Dafoe, his 'hillbilly' agent, sexy white girl)

Nerdy pawns (computer boy)

Oblivious pawns (Speedman and Strauss)

I did find it a bit comical that Dafoe's character's initials spell GOD.

I was able to look past most of the racial remarks made by Ice Cube (the supposed hero of the movie), however, the one that stuck out was when he called Dafoe's white NSA agent a 'hillbilly'.  Isn't that just a tab bit insulting and racist?...even if he was the bad guy.  I could understand if the villain was to utter those words to the hero, as it further degrades the villain's character.  For one thing, the guy wasn't even remotely 'backwoods' material.  He was a highly trained/educated special agent.

Also, why does the movie have to portray most of the black characters as ""cool"" criminals?  Ice Cube's only friends run chop shops.  Is that supposed to imply this is a cool profession?  If you've never had your car stolen before, you probably don't see a problem with this.

As XXX-2 was worse than the first, let's hope the third installment doesn't follow suit.",1123977600,5,2855,4.798767967145791
2325967,4,B0009VY0OM,"Suprised me...Ice Cube did a good job.  The movie was non stop action packed with good special effects.  Good mixture of action, humor and sarcasim.",1123891200,4,148,4.88
2325968,2,B0009VY0OM,"When you sit down to watch a movie like XXX: State of the Union, you know you won't be seeing CITIZEN KANE, or even DIE HARD.  You expect fast, silly, explosive action.  Not a lot of exposition, not a lot of rich characterization.  And on that count, XXX II succeeds.  Unfortunately, it is also a hamfisted bore.

There are plenty of explosions, guns-firing, & cars and boats doing ridiculous things.  All well and good.  Sounds like a James Bond movie (which, you may remember, the original XXX was supposed to be...a Bond for this generation.  Ironically, the ""old-school"" Bond still does better.).  But where Bond movies have some charm, some energy and some originality (the silliness factor in Bond movies is always overshadowed by the ""how did they think of that"" factor), XXX seems confused and needlessly loud.  And one of the biggest stunts, involving a speedboat jumping onto a bridge of car traffic comes right from LIVE AND LET DIE...a Bond flick that's what, 30 YEARS OLD?  Yes, this movie has a more throbbing sound mix, better crunching of innocent cars, but the basic idea for the stunt has a very tired feel...as does its execution.

The story, about how the Secretary of Defense is planning a coup in which he'll overthrow the compromise-with-terrorists-minded president wants to be thrilling and high-stakes.  But not for one minute is the method for accomplishing this overthrow of government believable.  An action movie of this ilk MUST make us suspend our disbelief.  We never say to ourselves...""yeah, this could happen."" But we should say, ""I'm gonna enjoy this and see where it takes us.""  In XXX, the best I usually mustered was...""it's gotta get better, right?""

But plot concerns aside, the movie isn't even fun on an ""actors having fun"" level.  Ice Cube, who can be somewhat charming in the right vehicle, plays a hardened con / former Navy SEAL, who gets a shot at redemption by becoming the new XXX.  He looks bored in this first scene, and he looks bored in all subsequent scenes.  He's supposed to look tough, world-weary, impervious...at least, I think that's the point.  But bored is the best we get.  He has some ""romantic"" scenes with an ex-girlfriend, and the amount of chemistry they generate makes Luke Wilson & Kate Hudson's scenes in ALEX & EMMA look like the hottest romance in film history.

Supporting ""acting"" is provided by Scott Speedman, looking ridiculous in a semi-heroic, semi-tightass role.  Peter Strauss looks the part of president, but his part is underwritten, to say the least.  Willem Dafoe is the evil secretary of state (he's evil because he wants to overthrow the government, yes...but the real message here from the filmmakers is that anyone who thinks that we should deal with terrorists by taking the battle to them is evil...real subtle!!).  Dafoe is also not the least bit convincing.  We all know this guy can play deranged, evil, threatening, whatever.  He's often a great actor.  But it seems to me that often when he takes these ""paycheck"" roles...where much isn't expected of him...he delivers NOT MUCH.  He's a scary looking guy...but there ought to be more there.  Samuel Jackson once again coasts through the kind of part he could do with his eyes closed.  He cannot help but bring energy to a scene...he's the best thing in the movie...and that, more than anything else I can say kinda sums up the film.  When Samuel Jackson, at his most bored, clich&eacute;d and predictable still steals the movie...you know you've got problems.

I can't really think of a reason to spend 2 hours of your time watching this film.  It doesn't even deliver on the most basic level.",1123804800,5,3641,4.846029173419773

These two actors continue to astound me and for their performances alone, ""State of the Union"" is at least worth watching once.  Dafoe's portrayal of a meglomaniac Secretary of Defense is one of his best bad boys.  I prefer Vin Diesel as XXX, but Ice Cube did show a little more depth than he did in ""Barbershop.""

They're planning on getting a different Agent X (according to the script) so Ice Cube probably will not be in the next show.  If they keep Jackson as Gibbons, I think it'll be worth watching.",1123286400,2,619,4.491071428571429

When the car was chasing the train at the end it seemed like i was watching a video game. Just terrible movie, and i did like the first.",1123200000,3,425,4.132530120481928
2325974,3,B0009VY0OM,"OK, I admit I am not the target audience for a movie like this - so read this review with that in mind.  I rented this in one of those ""aw, what the heck"" moments.  I really like Samuel L. Jackson, Ice Cube, and Willem Dafoe and figured how bad could it really be.

Well, if you like non-stop hyperactive action that exceeds all bounds of reality and physics, then this is your cup of tea.  However, I am not a tea drinker.  It really was an ok way to turn off the brain for a couple of hours.  There are a few plot twists and some action sequences that are pretty good.  But when it gets to the CGI portions, it isn't so good.  The super fast cars, trains, and low flying helicopters look like cartoons and the movie suffers from the break with the suspension of disbelief.

Still, the actors do well with what they are given and I enjoyed it in that kind of mind numbed way that the movie asks of us.  Although without the performances delivered by the stars, this movie would sink like a rock in my rating system.",1123113600,5,1016,4.164102564102564
2325975,2,B0009VY0OM,"I was a real fan of the original tripple X.  Finally, we had a spy, although unlikely, was a bit more believable than Bond.  The plot, other than a comic book type crazed killer, was intruigeing, the tempo was beyond belief, the sound track was good, and the hero was a stand-up guy.  I liked the concept of a protagonist that began as a self-centered thrill seeker who gradually turned into someone that saw true evil and decided it was up to himself to make things right.

  I was anxious for a sequal, and upon the previews, wondered why Vin did not return.  After seeing the film, I soon discovered why (he most likely vomited while reading the script).

  The film started with a gripping plot.  Gibbon's (Samuel Jackson) branch of the NSA is attacked by unknown high-tech assailents.  Most of the branch (made up of Gibbon's military team)has or is in the process of being assasinated.  Gibbons decides to go further out of the box, and recruit a member of his former SEAL team (Ice Cube), who is currently searving time in military prison (for insubordination and punching his commander, portrayed by William DeFoe).  A prison break is exicuted, and Ice Cube becomes the new xXx.

  From therein, the plot and Ice Cube's charactor becomes downright offensive.  In a nutshell, William DeFoe's charactor is planning to unseat the president...why?  Because the president is a Clintonista liberal who wants to understaaaaand our enemies, turning the other cheek to attacks and showering them with aid.  The ""evil"" DeFoe, instead, wants to strengthen the military enough to be able to properly defend the country (this is evil?!?  Apparently so, and why terrorist attacks seem to continue.)  DeFoe's charactor believes the only way to do this is to enact a small coup on the capitol building.  It's up to a bunch of unrepentant gang bangers/car theives to save America.  Unlike the original, where there is charactor developement, it is absent in the sequal.  Other than a side National Security head man, no one else seems to care why they are trying to rescue the president, just what's in it for themselves (especially the gang bangers; they are in it for the right to jack cars in D.C.).  Oh, yes, did I mention ample gratuitous black on white racist cracks (especilly comapiring an NRA chairman to a Ku Klux Klansman)?  I used to like Ice Cube (in movie roles), but after starring in this garbage, well, I have to throw him in the same bin as other Hollywood RDDB's (I'm very surprised someone the caliber of Samuel L. Jackson would appear in something like this unless he was bound by contact).

  Well, guys, if you are going to make another xXx similar to this debacle, here's your plot:  Right wing radio talk show hosts have invaded the capitol.  Gibbons goes further out of the box and springs an ex-Al Quida member from Guantanimo Bay.  Together with the help of the ACLU and GLAD, explosions and lawsuits fly and anyone to the right of the loony left is overcome by compassion.  The president disolves all the armed forces, and every dictator in the world is so overcome by our understaaaaanding, that they all throw down their guns and step down from power, and the world is at one with peace.  Hey, it's in line with the sub plot of this movie, and the way a certain group of writers in Hollywood seem to think.  And they wonder why box office reciepts are down.  Please excuse me while I snap in ""Seargent York"" so I can see what Hollywood was at one time and feel like an American again.",1122854400,32,3506,4.66068515497553
2325976,3,B0009VY0OM,"After assassins infiltrate his secret government agency, Agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) seeks out a new XXX agent to help him investigate a growing conspiracy plot. Gibbons turns to Darius Stone (Ice Cube), a falsely imprisoned soldier who is looking to exact a little revenge on the general (Willem Dafoe) that put him behind bars. Armed with weapons, sassmouth, and unlimited resources, Darius infiltrates government levels his own way in an effort to find out who is planning to take over the presidency in the name of homeland security. +

If you can get past the endless racket, thunderous balls of fire, frightful acting, lousy special effects, monotone rap soundtrack, Dafoe on auto-pilot, wacky plot, a Casio-meets-Steve Vai score, some shameless pandering to the urban audience, the glorification of illegal lifestyles, and the fact that every female character has stilettos and Himalayan-like cleavage, you might enjoy one of the most needless sequels around, ""State of the Union."" Of course, even at its lowest point, ""Union"" is still resoundingly better than 2002's original, and appalling, ""XXX.""",1122854400,,1112,5.354285714285714

That my friends, is XXX:state of the union.

Ice Cube plays the role of XXX this time and i really wish Vin diesel would have not been so damn greedy and just accepted the offer that the XXX production company was offering him to be in this sequal.
With a government themed conspiracy plot that would make tom clancy  break into tears of laughter, XXX 2 has William Dafoe playing an evil Secretary of defense who has a plan to Kill the president and the vice President during the night that the president is delivering the state of the union address, Alas the title XXX:state of the union.

So Big time War Criminal Ice cube is chosen to be the new XXX by his old commander(Samuel L jackson) and must team up with Xzibit from pimp my ride and a NSA agent and convicts and try to stop this evil plot themselves.

The Negatives-One big negative of this movie is ICE CUBE!!!!!
Come on Ice cube as XXX?? the big bad XXX? Ice Cube??
If this movie was real life Ice Cube would have had a heart attack in the first 5 minutes of action, as he looks kind of on the chunky side, even though he does have muscle, Ice Cube is not Action hero material.

Reality check- Okay now i know this is a movie, and movies stretch reality sometimes but COMEON, this movie breaks the rules of reality and it makes the movie seem very fake and it takes away from the experience.
I'll give you 2 examples!

1-XXX must have a new gadget it's called BULLET PROOF BUBBLE!
Ice cube is swimming away while bullets are being shot at him and 20 bullets whiz by his head, legs, and sides and not EVEN ONE hits him????? COME ON!!!!

2-I didn't know Cars can ride like trains if you put them on traintracks. XXX is chasing this high speeding train and what does he decide to do? of course he throws his car on the traintracks and goes so fast that the tires burn off and only his rims are left and his car is going as fast as the train on the railroad. YEAH RIGHT.
I'm on a roll i'll give you one more example!

3-XXX has been through war world 4, has survived gunfights, knifefights,explosions,car accidents and at the end he only has a little scratch on his face?? a scratch? just a little BOO-BOO?
Wow he really must be tough.

Another thing this movie should have been called
XXX:Pimp my ride Edition.
Xzibit??? Xzibit is going to save the country with ICE CUBE?
hahahahahahahahahaha
And with all the cars that were being modded and showcased i swear i thought i rented a movie of pimp my ride.

Positives-I did like the scene where XXX breaks out of prison with Ice cube running on rooftops and reaching for helicopter in midair(even though it was unreal but hey it looked cool)
and the opening scene with the NSA agency being attacked was good. Also when a very annoying character gets finally killed i was so glad.

Conclusion-Bad Casting, Unreal action scenes even by movie standards, Cliche' action movie ending is XXX:state of the union. Rent if you want some good laughs though.

After paying the typical rental fee from my local video store, I feel the money would have been better spent renting something else. After reading that Vin Diesel and the original director left after seeing the script, my respect for them both went up tremendously. Everyone has principals and after seeing this Left Wing Hit piece I can almost forgive Vin Diesel for his role in the Pacifier.

  The movie started out with some serious promise, but QUICKLY goes down hill. From the Al Gore Clone as President to the Left Wing Stick Man of a disgruntled General of Southern descent who attempts a Coup De'Tat because his budget is being cut, bases closed, and troop levels lowered. All in the name of feeding the poor, leveling the Social playing field, making nice with our enemies, trying to reach out to those who would see us dead. The movie has RACIST overtones scattered through out it's entirety. From the typical portrayal of the Sergeant backing the Bad General who carries a lighter with BAMA on it. This Movie is just the Fantasy wishes of the Left Wing Girlie Boys who know nothing of Honor, Duty or Country.

The younger crowd will obviously be enthralled with Ice Cube and company, which is fine, I liked Ice Cube's performance.  But, for us in the older crowd we get the treat of Emmy winner Peter Strauss.  To me, Strauss is by far, the best actor to come along.  But I'm not biased! For those in my demographic, could we ever forget Rich Man, Poor Man, Jericho Mile, Kane and Abel and so much more?  Strauss is a seasoned veteran of the small screen.  But, it was great to see him on the big screen.  I'll get the DVD for his acting alone.  Plus, sidebar note, Willem Dafoe is fantastic in his own right.  I guess the movie was balanced with the hip hop group and the guys who played it on the level.

My biggest complaint is that they killed off Vin Diesel.  I don't understand a guy who was so brilliant got axed so easily so they could make room for a new triple-x.  Wouldn't be better to have him in a witness protection program to live out his days and just bring on new triple-x's as needed?
