8585321,4,1565672380,"Sleepy Eyes Of Death - Sword Of Fire - While traveling through the countryside Kyoshiro is forced to defend himself against an angry samurai trying to kill an apparently innocent woman.  He is soon to find out that  the woman is far from innocent and he unwittingly becomes ensnared in a  convoluted plot kill off a band of smugglers that have been siphoning off  loot from the shogun's treasury and giving it to one of the local (and very  corrupt) officials.  True to form, Kyoshiro sides with the underdogs and  uses his blade to make things right.  The sword battles in this film are  very good and Kyoshiro dispenses his dark humor with the same flair as he  wields his blade.  As with the other films in this series, the camerawork  and widescreen format are a treat and the acting and overall production  values make this one a joy to watch.  Oh yes, Kyoshiro takes special care  of the ""innocent"" woman from the start of the film.",962409600,5,938,4.532934131736527
