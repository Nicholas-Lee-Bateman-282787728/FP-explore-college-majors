8288845,4,B001CQVFBO,good dvd but doug stange keeps lots of fish hope he chokes on fish bones,1414022400,,72,3.8666666666666667
8288846,3,B001CQVFBO,As the title says this DVD has a lot of chapters on catching bluegills which is fine except they all feel the same. You're just watching them pull out big bluegills with a brief discussion on the lures being used. The perch chapter is also on another pan fish DVD so that was disappointing. Plus all you really see is Doug pulling out perch. The Crappie chapters and white bass chapters were nice but nothing I have not seen before. This video was kind of disappointing but worth watching once and can still be a good DVD for beginners.,1375142400,2,536,4.424242424242424
8288847,4,B001CQVFBO,this pan fish video is so informative. I'm so glad to be able to learn more about pan fish fishing . I've done this more than 60 years ago and forgot so much about this type of fishing. I really enjoyed this video.,1338163200,,214,4.0
