4830951,4,B005LZW87M,There is nothing new in the plot of this story or the fact that it is part of the video-cam horror genera. I am a horror fan so these facts weren't going to stop me if it was an overall good film...and it was. I felt the acting was very good. The scares where paced nicely and the end was a bit different from some of the other movies of this ilk. So I say it is well worth the rental and I hope to see more from the creators of this film. Good job.,1345766400,2,449,3.736842105263158

4830954,4,B005LZW87M,"i should probably start this by saying that I'm a huge horror fan.  I don't really like slasher films/gore or saw esc. movies as i lean much more towards supernatural/ghost related films.  When my friends and i first got this movie we turned it off ten minutes in, but because we already bought it we figured we might as well finish it.  I was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film.  It picked up quickly and kept going.  The acting is sub-par, specifically that blonde actress (she's god awful), but the story line and production of the movie turned out to be pretty good.  the idea is far from original (6 people in an abandoned mental asylum) but it still had some good quality scares in it.  It's worth a watch if you like supernatural horror or found footage horror.",1330300800,36,775,4.453900709219858
4830955,1,B005LZW87M,"(Warning...contains some mild spoilers.)
Rented this after reading a bunch of 4 & 5 star reviews that I now am absolutely convinced were written by either the writers, producers, actors, or family members of the people who made this horrible movie.
How would I describe this movie? Terrible acting, boring, and totally unconvincing in EVERY way. First, they're supposed to be in an ""abandoned asylum"", and it was filmed in a building that was obviously not abandoned OR was ever an asylum.  (Rooms full of cheap,modern plastic furniture and LIVE plants? In an ""abandoned asylum""? I don't think so.) I had the impression that they were begrudgingly given permission to film in a community center or a school somewhere that was undergoing some renovations, but were told to not touch or move anything that was there, so they really couldn't do anything to try to make it actually look like an abandoned asylum.  The setting was so terrible it was actually distracting to the story.
Second, the characters do things that no one would EVER do. One of them suddenly and inexplicably becomes catatonic to the point to being almost comatose, and the other characters reactions aren't to even TRY to CALL FOR AN AMBULANCE like normal people would do...but to drag her back to her room and leave her in a sleeping bag on the floor. And another character gets dragged off screaming and disappears in front of two of the others, and their reaction is...""he's gone...let's take his flashlight in case ours runs out of batteries.""  WTF?  Seriously?
Don't waste a second of your time on this tripe.  Horrible.",1327536000,30,1595,4.870848708487085
4830956,1,B005LZW87M,"Good lord, this movie is The Most Annoying Thing You Will Ever Watch. This is so bad. More obnoxious than scary and the ""sending people into a mental hospital with cameras"" schtick is getting old. Like, at least 20 years old. Remember the show ""Fear"" on mtv way back in the day? That was WAY more scary than this pile. There's a reason nobody has seen this movie. It's awful. It's painfully mediocre, which is the worst because you can't even laugh at it. It's pathetic. HATED it!",1326585600,3,480,4.465909090909091
4830957,2,B005LZW87M,This is something that I really tried to get into and overall the cast was good all except for as another reviewer pointed out there's one blonde chick named Lena... Basically 28 minutes in and she has been screaming and throwing Tantrums the entire movie. As if that's not bad enough one of the guys whose name I can't remember already it's constantly yelling at her because of her Tantrums. So far the only Annoying and scary thing is the fact the two of them keep yelling back and forth at each other at the top of their lungs almost screaching. It's obnoxious as hell and I kind of wish it ghost would come out and eat them all.,1496880000,,632,4.319327731092437
4830958,2,B005LZW87M,"While not the first, the Blair Witch was at it's time a very effective representation of found footage. (BTW look online for the never was a witch theory,but it was all a planned murder carefully crafted against heather). A side effect of this successful film was, for good or bad, a glut of similar styled formats,most notably the Paranormal series.
How ever this forget able little addition  fails to make good use of  the genre and its potentially great setting, a psychiatric asylum.
the tag says it all On April 30, 2010, six reality television show contestants spent seven nights in an abandoned and haunted asylum. The show never aired but an editor for the network was able to piece together some footage. The prize for staying all seven nights was a share of one million dollars that was to be split amongst any contestants that didn't leave. No prize money was ever awarded.
We are given very little background info on the place and less unfolds as we watch. The idea of insane ghosts is great but fails to be exploited.
The characters are 2 dimensional and seem unconcerned as members vanish one by one...I mean wouldn't you search the whole hospital for them?
Nope, instead, it's ""let's go to sleep"" In one night two people disappear, and after the initial ""OH $#!+, THEY VANISHED,"" they acknowledge it and skip off to the next nightly challenge
As for scares, well, they are the usual face change, shadow in the corner schtick. The only ""patient"" we hear about is an unnamed little girl who haunts the place. No background, no other horrific ghosts with terrifying pasts that once lived here, just shadows.
Had they gone to specific sites that were scenes od heinus acts we would be more engaged, No history of demented orderlies, over strict nurses or sadistic doctor torturing or maiming inmates.

First of all, the blonde female (Lina or Nina, whatever) is the most annoying thing on the planet. I almost shut it off just because of her voice. I could tell she was acting from the start. The ""abandoned asylum"" that they're in looks like a community building. It's lightly furnished with plants and was recently cleaned. They actors do interviews at the end of everyday. In their interviews they're always wearing the same outfit and look sparkly fresh. At least make them wear the same outfit that they were wearing during ""that day""! The movie is basically 5 nearly 30 year old adults running in the dark with shaking flashlights, screaming at every speck of dust that floats by. The blonde chick thinks she runs the show until everyone decides they don't want to listen to her during her first tantrum at their seance. Suddenly and unexpectedly (jk) she is struck into a possession! About a day later, while the group is doing their daily task, they see the blonde bimbo in the hallway standing creepily, with her head cocked to the side. (Raise your hand if you haven't seen that in a movie before). The brunette bimbo shrieks at absolutely EVERYTHING. They try to speak to the ghosts but no one will shut up long enough to actually listen. All the ""ghosties"" are poorly dressed actors similar to what you would see at any local haunted walkthrough in October. Yadda yadda yadda.

4831034,5,B005LZW87M,"So these four guys and two ladies enter a contest to split the winnings from a million dollars. All they have to do is last seven nights in an abandoned mental hospital. They are tasked with filming their own experiences, every one of them has a camera, flashlights, etc. The first couple few nights the tension builds quietly, with odd events occurring but don't scare off the cast.

Then as every night goes by, as they complete one task a night, the heat builds. In this place of pain and sorrow, there are evil spirits that live in the night, and they are very unhappy. Every night brings a new level of horror and the contestants start disappearing. Did they quit and leave the contest, or....?

It's late at night and I have a nice pair of headphones on, watching this movie. The filming seems natural if you were an unprofessional camera person, and the jerkiness and bad lighting adds to the horror as it builds.

For obviously a young production company, and new faces to movie making, this is a very nice treat. The tension that builds seems real, and the mood seems very real, as if you were actually there. But you do have to get past the first 15 minutes of the movie, it seems like a lot of bickering.

Towards the end I kept checking how much time was left, knowing the most horrible was coming up. But I kept watching!

This is a great way to spend the evening scaring yourself, if you watch it in the dark with headphones on. I am a seasoned movie watcher, and don't understand why so many people didn't get the point of this movie, if they had immersed themselves in the story they would have had a great scary ride.

Highly recommended for a fun evening, if you give it a chance. The only letdown was at the end there were loose ends, and it would have been nice if they completed the story a little better. But go ahead, watch it with an open mind, you might just enjoy it!",1423699200,4,1893,4.348441926345609

Yet, here I am, realizing that it isn't all that bad!  Yes, it is low budget, yes, it starts off slow, but for those of you who have been on a ghost hunt/paranormal investigation, these people go through many of the stages that beginning investigators go through.

My favorite part is when, about 2/3 of the way through the movie, the biggest skeptic in the bunch tries to rationalize what he's been observing.  This is a stage that any good investigator will go through, trying to explain what s/he is seeing, before realizing that not everything that happens has a rational explanation.

Also, for those who wonder about the location, a little research on my part dug up a lot about the location, which is a supposedly haunted location in Madison, OH, that is currently privately owned.

For me, this was a really creepy movie with very good 'made ya jump' scares.  I appreciated the absence of rivers of blood, gore or slashing, just wish they could have cut down the number of f-bombs.  Also, this is a ""lost/found video"" movie, which I personally like a lot,

So, as stated, the story revolves around 6 contestants who must stay in this abandoned asylum for 7 days, if they do they will receive 1/6th share of a million dollars.  The more players who leave then, the more money each could make.  They are also tasked with one 'must do' chore  each night; ie, ""explore the basement and first floor"".  Okay, good premise as far as I'm concerned.  The characters are all very different individuals, and yes, one or two are annoying, but that's just a counter-point and don't all movies like this have a jackass or two?  I've read that the acting was terrible, I beg to differ, I thought the actors were very believable.  I actually looked at them and thought they were truly afraid going down the pitch-black halls with just flashlights, who wouldn't be if you were in an old building at night?  I heard nervous giggles, the kind that slip out when you're trying to convince others you aren't frightened.

So, all in all, I'd say  7 Nights of Darkness is a fun ride, a good scarey journey, and you'll want to wait for the credits to run ALL the way through for a little extra surprise.  Enjoy!",1393286400,,1643,4.5563139931740615

The building isn't wired with cameras as many reality shows, or filled with cameramen, but rather, the contestants carry their own cameras.

Most of the characters start out saying that they don't believe in ghosts/spirits/etc. yet start screaming and cussing at every shadow (and with the lack of lighting, there are a lot of them). The ending you can see coming a mile away, too. Bad setting too. It is distracting because they are obviously NOT in an abandoned asylum. I thought, ""Hey B rated horror movies can be entertaining!""

In this version 6 contestants must spend 7 days and nights in an abandon mental institution which is apparently haunted for some unknown reason. Each day consists of a new task as they explore the institution and perform seances.

Eventually the movie takes on the aspect of ""Ten Little Indians."" There some basic problems with this picture. First off, as they pretend to be a reality show, they have boring one on one interviews with the contestants. We already know this is a film and scripted. These type of interviews are boring in reality TV shows, now we get to watch boring ones which we know are fake. I couldn't figure out the cameras as they would swap from great color to grainy black and white for no reason, even during the day. If you are going to pretend to be a found footage film, at least pretend the audience is smarter than a turnip.

The horror aspect of this film isn't bad if we haven't seen so many better horror films like this before. The comparison factor drives this film down. We all know creepy little girls are scary. The film doesn't leave you with an explanation, although a better sequel with a better script and better actors is possible.

 knew it was creepy, but never thought anyone would make a movie there.  what a great location for that.  i give it four stars because it could have been editted (for time) tighter, some of the scenes, but for what appears to be an amateur movie, i have to give them two thumbs up, the 'amateurness' of this movie and cast actually gives it it's charm, and worked to actually be SCARY : D  hope that's not 'cause i'm biased that it was made in my neighborhood.",1355788800,,2757,4.311284046692607

8478823,1,B005LZW87M,"Oh no, another found footage movie!  Ay caramba!  It's about 6 reality show contestants who have to spend the night in a haunted asylum.  They act like typical ghost investigators with their EMF meter technology.  These ""contestants"" are just typical loud-mouthed teens who freak out at the slightest sights and sounds such as bats flying in a dark basement and a bucket suddenly appearing in the middle of a hallway without explanation.  They also freak out when their flashlights stop working.  I like the spaghetti sauce cabinet though.  That stuff's scary good!

The movie loses me early on when the teens go to sleep and one girl sits up meditating, and soon after when the one guy with a camera spies on a fellow contestant female taking a shower.  Really bland.  As is typical of found footage films, these characters have no personality whatsoever.  While being interviewed some of them don't believe in ghosts, others admit they freak out over the slightest sound, and others just aren't interested in spending 7 nights here.  And yet, here they are with their lack of personality ruining the movie.

7 Nights of Darkness has a couple interesting moments at least.  The segment where they stumble upon a doll standing up behind a door is pretty good with unexplainable scratches on the nearby wall.  The seance 25 minutes in has no scariness whatsoever because the one girl is *way* too talkative and bratty to be a contestant.  This same girl appears to be faking the silent treatment after the seance is over as a way to make the others feel sorry for her since she claims to care deeply about the ghosts of this house whereas none of the other contestants give a crap, but she's not faking it.  She's ice cold and just sitting there on the floor.  The other contestants take her to her room.

One of the teens complains when he has to spend time in the same room with the girl.  It should be noted when the story shifts to the next day or night, it does so in the lamest way ever with no atmosphere to speak of.  When the ""investigators"" hear a baby crying, an investigator in another room sneaks around the corner of the hallway and says ""Hey guys!"" freaking the rest of group out, proving that *all* of them are really timid!

They stumble upon a pizza box with worms all over it, and the one girl freaks out big time over this.  They find a note that says lobotomies were often performed here.  A long sharp instrument was inserted under the eyelid of the patient with a hammer through their skull and brain.  The other girl of the group is encouraged to be locked into the chair.  The ice cold silent treatment girl wakes up just in time for the contestants to find something unusual in one of the pictures they took... and she RUNS down the hallway towards the group and attacks them resulting in a LOT of screaming.

The contestants get into an argument when the one guy doesn't want to be in the same room as the woman who just ran down the hallway and attacked the group.  Yeah, I wouldn't want to be alone with her either.  I can understand his complaint.  This storyline is a total mess up to this point.  Being alone with the girl, he tries to talk to her but she doesn't move a muscle.  He questions who she is- perhaps a local actress.  But she still won't move.  He thinks she's faking it.  He mentions how he'd like to take her clothes off and that he bets she'd like that.  He knows plenty of websites who'd pay good money for a pretty girl like her tied up in a chair showing everything she has.  She opens her eyes and gives the guy a mean look.  He wants to know who hired her, what her game is and what her reason is for being here.  He mentions something I was wondering- how can she be so talkative before the seance then become so silent!  WHOA!  An actual scary scene!  She takes exception to being criticized for her talkative ways.  Her face turns green and she lunges towards the guy.

In the next scene, the other girl of the group gets a major surprise- she walks into a room with a camera and nobody's there.  Suddenly she turns back around and three guys are playing cards at a table.  A moment ago nobody was sitting there, AHHHHH!!  Actually that is kind of scary.  They all start fighting again when the girl says nobody was sitting at the table a moment ago.

One of the guys says he was sent here by one of the producers which upsets the rest of the group.  He says he's here to make sure everyone leaves, and to do everything in his power to make sure that happens.  The maggots in the food, the baby crying... it was all him.  But the one thing that is NOT set up is the silent girl upstairs with the green lunging face.  That wasn't in the script!  They get into another argument when unexplainable images appear on the cell phone.  They all accuse the guy sent here by the producers of staging it.  They decide to check on the silent treatment girl and determine they're all going to split up the money when the 7th night is over.

Of course when they get there the girl is gone.  Her green face must've angered a demon, forcing the demon to let the girl roam free.  The guy tries to explain the girl's green face but nobody listens because he's the same guy who was sent here by the producers, so nobody believes him.  The group talks sensibly for a while which is hard to believe.

The one guy takes a pee, turns the faucet on and hears lots of wall pounding behind him from the bathroom stall.  He freaks out like a baby.  Wow just open the door already!  Don't be scared!  It takes a couple minutes for him to get the courage to open that door.  When he does nothing's there... at first.  When he opens the door again now a girl's there.  The camera goes out.

The group finds a note that says a little girl is known to roam these hallways so the group does another seance to try and summon her.  They ask if she's lonely here.  No reply means she's too lonely to speak... I suppose. A little girl skips past the doorway.  Suddenly they all see her.  For some reason a second or two later everyone relaxes and talks about what they saw in the camera which is lame.  Talk about the scary girl you just saw!

The one guy being interviewed says it's not fun being the guy who's always scared and picked on.  He's right, that's not fun at all.  He implies he wants to be a leader for the rest of the group.  While the group is sleeping the green-faced girl who escaped from the chair earlier appears in front of them giggling and touching them.  She lacks confidence all of a sudden.  She was the most talkative person of the group early on- now she can only communicate with the group while they're asleep.

When they all wake up one of the guys is gone.  He says he went to the bathroom when questioned.  ""I have to wake you up when I drop a turd?""  haha.  The groups tries to tell themselves it'll be safe since they only have 2 nights left.  I just want those 2 nights to hurry up already!  This movie's horrible!  The guy won't leave the bathroom.  He's too scared.  They say he has to leave or the producers won't give him any money, but he says he'll go to a jury if he has to.  Yes that'll work.

From here the contestants quietly discuss that they're going to wait it out and just stand around panicking.  They're panicking but the viewers aren't.  The little girl doll standing up turns into a regular little girl who walks forward strangely.  The guy in the same room tries to leave but someone drags him from behind.  This movie has a way of returning to normal conversational talk among the contestants after a scare happens.  It's probably the lamest thing about 7 Nights of Darkness.  A good horror keeps the horror flowing and won't drop the scares suddenly giving the feeling these contestants have short term memory loss.

Maybe the contestants forget what just happened a moment earlier, but I think they just like to hear themselves speak.  More door banging when a man and female contestant are in the room together.  One guy says something just touched him.  The camera gets jerky when a woman in a black dress runs down the hallway towards the two contestants.  When they slam the door the noise stops and she goes away.  When they look through the door hole... wasted opportunity here.  Nothing happens.  That would have been a GREAT moment for something scary too.

The girl contestant refuses to stick around and screams when a demon girl crawls awkwardly up the stairs.  Okay I admit this part is very scary!  The guy tries to leave the asylum but the door won't open.  Bad door!  Meanwhile a demon swarms around the room.  The movie ends.  Horrible, just horrible.",1499212800,,8644,4.4
