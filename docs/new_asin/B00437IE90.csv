8414235,4,B00437IE90,"I saw some version of this ""Hit Favorites"" on sale pretty cheap, so I bought it. I wasn't impressed with the format, having to watch intros & credits between each show, but what does it matter what I think? My 3.5 year old loves it. I have since bought several themes of these, Halloween, Fall (I think??), Animals, Spring, Christmas. They are pretty cheap compared to most kids DVD's. He likes them all! Didn't hold the attention of my 18m old, however.",1351209600,,454,4.548780487804878
8414236,4,B00437IE90,"I love these HIT Entertainment DVDs where they put a whole bunch of my son's favorite characters on one DVD.  With ""Animal Tails"" my boys get to watch a Bob the Builder episode, Thomas & Friends episode, Barney and their favorite Fireman Sam!  Each episode is short but really it is perfect for my boys attention span and now there is no fighting over watch a Bob or Thomas DVD.  This particular DVD focuses on episodes involving animals which my little guy is a big animal lover so he loves to point out the animals in the episodes and make their noises!  All of the episodes are high-quality content for young kids and of course teach great lessons like responsibility and friendship.  The animal theme is cute and great whether your child is a big animal lover or not!",1290470400,,771,4.517985611510792
