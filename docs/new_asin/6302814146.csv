There are ways that it could be improved, but it has satire, belly-laughs, and some of the silliest songs pre- or post- Spinal Tap that you will ever hear.  Yes, it has some slow parts, and you can't always tell whether Beauty and Hoffman are totally true to their characters or just bumming around (their characters are basically bums, so it's hard to tell).  But they are having so much fun (a la Crosby and Hope) and there are enough excellent comic scenes (also a la the Crosby-Hope Road movies- but more contemporary of course), that it is worth all the accolades it did NOT receive when it came out.  Turns out that, according to Mike Nichols, the bad press on the movie was a kind of 'studio suicide' since it actually originated from the studio itself when it switched heads mid-movie.  This is something of a classic movie, and every film buff should see it for historical reasons alone-- the rest of us should watch it because it is funny.",1486080000,,1018,4.540983606557377

Talon: I liked it! ISHTAR wasn't blow-my-mind astonishing, but it shouldn't be credited as one of the worst movies ever made. This doesn't come close in awfulness to some of the stuff I've seen.

Joe: I saw ISHTAR in the theater back in 1987. I liked it then. I like it now. The songs are laugh out loud funny, and all the actors commit fully and do a great job.

This is a three star movie. Unlike some of the other films we've watching, such as--

Talon: You don't wanna go down that road, man!

Don't do it!

No! Oh no! Not ZAAT. Please don't bring back the ZAAT!

Hugging myself and rocking back and forth under a hot shower is the only way to cope after seeing ZAAT.

ISHTAR, on the other hand, had laughs. Some romance and suspense. Good characters. A great soundtrack. And it was ongoing fun with an adorable ending.

Turns on intercom.

Action action! Read all about it! The haters are wrong! The haters are wrong!

The only thing wrong with this movie was the soundtrack was never released.

Joe: Agreed. I'd pay a hundred bucks for an official soundtrack.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""Finally! A movie that doesn't suck!""

(singing loudly) ""Telling the truth can be dangerous business!""

""How did they mistake her for a boy?""
""It's a reverse TOOTSIE.""

""Holy crap Dustin Hoffman is in this?""
""It's a reverse TOOTSIE.""

""This is going on our blog?""
""I know. It's good.""

That lyrical genius tells you all about this movie. It's so bad, it's awesome. I discovered this movie many years ago because the local video store had a selection of terrible movies as $0.50 rentals and I had heard that it was one of the biggest flops of all time. Insanely over budget and met with critical and popular scorn. I loved it!

I think you're more likely to enjoy this movie if you go into it understanding it's a failure in so many ways. But then--like me--you may just begin to wonder if its unintentional quirkiness was actually pure brilliance (it wasn't). And you may find it hilarious!",1483228800,2,819,4.417218543046357

517440,4,6302814146,"I remember seeing/reading review after review after review for this movie long before it was ever released (huh?), and all of the reviewers were trashing Ishtar! I was living/working in LA at the time and I remember the film getting a lot of negative press for the simple reason that a buddy comedy could cost 100 million to produce. Granted, that is a lot of coin, yes, but it was Hoffman, Beatty, Grodin and Elaine May shooting on location in Morocco and regardless of its cost, it is an extremely clever, funny and very entertaining movie. I liked it when it was first released and I still like it 25 years later. Hoffman, Beatty and the always underrated Grodin (what an actor!) are all excellent. How can you not love Dustin and Warren desperately writing their hit song ""Dangerous Business"" (during which Dustin stops singing to ask, ""Why...?"" so beautifully).  The songs, by the way, were actually written by the one and only, Paul Williams himself!

517490,3,6302814146,"Insensitive but still enjoyable (certainly when compared to today's movies) film about two bums (essentially) who think that they are the next wave in Simon and Garfunkel-tinged songwriting partnerships but are only playable in a remote region of Morocco, where tensions among middle East nations are flaring and a complicated conspiracy plot is about to unravel (somewhat amusingly, since screen great Charles Grodin is also on board here).
Although a critically damned picture ever since its release, ""Ishtar"" is actually not a bad film intrinsically, just frustrating and slow moving at times, with a story that is not filled with knee-slapping comedy (as most seem to believe for some reason) but rather carefully controlled political/pop culture satire. Elaine May, tragically, seems to have been cajoled by Beatty into doing a different kind of movie than the initial one that she had in mind, and the picture suffers because neither the performances nor the story are given enough room to breathe. I really feel that if this picture would have been about an hour longer it would not only make more sense but the rather lackluster bum performances by the two principles would be easier to appreciate as well. May was on the verge, I feel, of creating a new kind of screen comedy with this film but sadly her fortunes were lost after the film's financial and critical bombing after its initial release--probably a comedy that was more mature and yet more lethargic at the same time! Hoffman has never been much of an actor to me (even though I do own and watch a lot of his movies), but here he is somewhat enjoyable, and Beatty is always fun to watch even when he is uninspired to act well--but considering these characters, I don't think that these guys were acting poorly. ""Ishtar"" is not the great unseen classic comedy that I thought it might have been, but compared to today's filthy, unfunny, and youth-oriented ""comedy"" films, this one nearly looks like cinematic gold by comparison. And, at the very least, the story itself is very human, even if you do not empathize with these two quasi-losers...and humanity is also something lacking in today's films. Filmmakers/comediennes like Elaine May are hard acts to come by these days, so it is tragic that ""Ishtar"" never got the fair hearing that it deserved, despite the fact that the viewing public and newspaper critics didn't seem to get anything out of the movie at all. Now all this being said, I can understand why viewers are shocked by this movie because it does feel at times as if no one involved is really trying here...but that's part of the deal. May's humor is very different, and I suspect that she was very much a pessimist about the movie industry (especially after having seen what she went through on ""A New Leaf"" and ""Mikey and Nicky""). What we have here is not so much a comedy in the traditional sense but a funny, oddball, slow moving trip through the lives of two strange characters with a few outbursts of mean-spirited violence and a conspiracy kind of plot that is neither funny or engrossing and is supposed to be taken seriously. But with all this, May has attempted to create a new comic platform in the same way that Woody Allen, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Carl Reiner all have (but it's probably the case that May's sense of humor is too inward for most people).
My lower rating actually has to do with this Blu-Ray rather than the film itself. After all these years, one would think that contractual and financial disputes would be put behind the filmmakers and a proper extended (or restored) cut could have gotten a proper North American home video release, but sadly this is not the case. We only have a ""director's cut"" of the film which, to me, still does not do much to restore May's initial vision for the project. A really good idea was buried in this picture but the resulting film turned up (somewhat hilariously) on a list of the 20th century's worst ideas. Nevertheless, why no making of? Why no trailer? Why no intereviews with Beatty and Hoffman included here? Why no audio commentary by Beatty and/or Elaine May? Why no commentary track by a historian (especially since this is considered the ""Heaven's Gate"" of screen comedy films)? Who knows is all I can postulate...but this film, had it gone unreleased as Gene Siskel said it should have, would have been yet another ""The Day the Clown Cried"" case file for serious students of Hollywood film history. But ""Ishtar"" was released, and you have to take it or leave it. As awkward as the film is at times, I sat through the whole thing without getting upset, and if you are a true film lover you won't want to miss it in any case. As for now, it will remain the shortest verse in the history of Hollywood comedy film footnotes--""Beatty and Hoffman wept."" C+ (for the Blu Ray)",1448841600,,4832,4.726303317535545

517619,4,6302814146,"In spite of this review's seeming criticisms, ISHTAR (1987) is really one of my favorite comedies.
It's also one of the biggest box office failures ever, with a $51 million cost vs. only $14 million in US ticket sales.

This widely scorned picture appeals to me because it's written and directed by Elaine May, and I simply love her humor, but more significant is the idea of two would-be songwriter poets who dream of becoming the next Simon and Garfunkel. I've been there. OK, my stuff was better!

The insurmountable obstacle for Lyle Rogers (Warren Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Dustin Hoffman) is that they're stupendously mediocre, laboring hours over ultimately laughable lyrics and rudimentary melodies. Worse is that neither can carry a tune in a pail.

The film starts out so well, with both Lyle and Chuck writing awful songs, then boring, insulting or repelling restaurant and lounge customers. Both hit emotional walls when their girls dump them. (The scene with Chuck on the ledge is reminiscent of a Woody Allen set-up.) Alas, everything quickly bogs down once in Morocco, over some nonsense power struggle between an emir, the CIA and the inevitable rebels.

The funniest moment of this lion's share of the picture is when Lyle buys a blind camel on the advice of a pretty rebel woman. The beast that's foisted upon him (and by extension, Chuck) is not only sightless but refuses to be controlled by its new owners.

Charles Grodin turns in a yeoman job as the CIA agent, but what's needed here is more Lyle and Chuck ""songs"" and far less espionage and forced mayhem.

Even so, I believe ISHTAR is a must-see for fans of the three principals, also for anyone who's ever dreamed of writing popular songs. For the rest, that is the majority of potential viewers, honestly, this one may not hold your interest.",1427328000,,1819,4.814102564102564

While it is still summarily dismissed by many (who, I suspect, haven't seen it), those that have learned to love this supposedly unlovable film have also learned a valuable life lesson: never let anyone tell you what to think. If I had listened to the masses, and critics, I never would have enjoyed this dry, funny take on the old road movies of the 50s and 60s. I had not seen ""Ishtar"" in years when I stumbled upon its availability on AIV a few days ago. Lo and behold, it's still funny. ""Ishtar"" was unfairly trashed because it was a small comedy with a huge budget (granted, I'm still not sure how they spent what amounts to like $100 million in today's money.) Hollywood learned a lot from ""Ishtar,"" pairing down star-driven projects in favor of big-budget blockbusters. So, enjoy this for what it is: a unusual piece of film history that is likely never to be repeated.

NOTE: Even though the description to the AIV version is deemed the ""Director's Cut,"" I don't really remember any differences between this and the theatrical cut I saw years ago. This was disappointing, as I feel ""Ishtar"" could actually benefit from a director's cut, perhaps clarifying some aspects of its convoluted plot and giving more time to strong interplay between Beatty and Hoffman. And, is there's another scene with that hilarious camel, that would have been great too.",1426636800,,1451,4.735177865612648

517678,5,6302814146,"I was in college when Ishtar was in production and when it was released, taking a film class. I remember our professor telling us that the ""Hollywood rumor mill"" was going to kill this film before it was even released, and he was right. There were all kinds of stories about cost overruns, fighting between Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, producers/directors problems, etc. Every week or so, there was a negative article in the Hollywood Reporter about Ishtar's production.

Several years later, a friend got me a copy of the VHS tape for my birthday and told me to watch it. He said it was a very funny movie, despite the bad reviews.

So I watched it, and I found it to be a very funny movie. In fact, it's one of my favorites.

It is a parody, in many ways, of the old ""Road to ..."" films. It involves international intrigue, Cold War politics, and a love triangle, all featuring two protagonists who have no business being there.

Hoffman and Beatty play two broken losers aspiring to make it in songwriting. They find an agent who gets them a booking the North African nation of Ishtar, a fictitious nation somewhere near Libya.

Hoffman meets a beautiful woman in the airport who says she's in grave danger, and asks him to switch luggage with him and trade jackets so she can go undetected by those who are pursuing her. It goes downhill from there.

The humor is often absurdist, as Beatty and Hoffman's naivete and third-grade sense of chivalry come into conflict  with the cold hard world of Cold War politics, embodied by a very funny performance by Charles Grodin.

In many ways, it's amazing that a film with such absurd humor was given such a huge budget (it was a very big budget film for its time). It was a huge risk that unfortunately never paid off in the box office.

However, if you like that brand of humor, I strongly suggest at least renting Ishtar. You might find that the World's most notorious bad film isn't as bad as everyone says.",1410307200,,1962,4.5354107648725215

An obvious mistake, in retrospect, but one can't patronize every movie ever made; one must seek advice, a filter, somewhere. I remember like it was yesterday that parent corporation SONY had to write off $3.2 billion in losses for its Columbia Pictures division in the wake of this and a few other box office duds. Box office dud--how did that happen? I can only theorize that ""it didn't play in Peoria,"" i.e. ""Middle America"" didn't ""get"" the long setup of the boys' travails as wannabe Brill Building superstars prior to their arrival on the burning sands of northern Africa. The political intrigues that unfold there are much easier to relate to now, in the wake of various US military adventures overseas since 1987. Indeed, had I seen this film when it was released I would have been befuddled by its reference to ""Shia"" Muslims. Good ol' Chuck Grodin is excellent as straight-man CIA operative. As the decades passed, I developed a hankering to see this movie, if only out of morbid curiosity, but there was no option to do so.

They are told to sing well known songs but they can't sing those well either. They are offered an opportunity to go to Ishtar to perform, a gig that actually pays them less than minimum wage now or then. I won't go into further details, watch it & see.

I had this on Laserdisc for a few years, my wife, son and I have watched it many times and I bought the Blu-ray right after release. It is a relatively benign parody comedy. Sure it went over budget. Sure it isn't the best movie ever.

I think he was painfully too old for ""Shampoo"" and here when you'd expect him to turn on his obvious sexuality, they downplay that he has not any at all, which is like expecting a bushel basket to hide a bonfire.  Elaine May should be embarrassed too as the writer and director.  I must say, I don't know why she used a pseudonym on the screenplay for Otto Preminger's ""Such Good Friends"" as it was infinitely funnier than this bomb.  The singing duo, and their ""songs"" mostly credited partially to Paul Williams are so unbelievable bad and so unbelievable that they could give lasting credence to their choice of career for five minutes let alone a seeming lifetime shows the depth to the bottom this film exhibits for the talent involved.  Only Isabelle Adjani deserves credit for being able to cry so effectively as she typically can do and create a sympathetic character although otherwise false historically.

517757,5,6302814146,"I have to admit, I use this movie as a sort of Litmus test.

A Litmus test for what, however, I'm not sure exactly.  Independence of thought?  The self-confidence to admit that they enjoy something that has been institutionalized as the platonic ideal of the Bad Movie?  A goofy sense of humor?  A light-hearded joie de vivre?  You tell me.  All I know is that if someone admits to liking this movie, I almost always find them to be pleasant company.

Personally, I have loved this movie, unconditionally and unabashedly, ever since it came out, in spite of the social and media-provided pre-conditioning that encouraged the world to hate it sight-unseen, and I have always been baffled by the knee-jerk hatred expressed by most people, especially when they haven't seen it.  There isn't much that can perk up my mood faster than this movie can.  Sure, it hasn't held up as well as it could have since its release in 1987, thanks in large part due to the cheesy one-man-synthesizer-band score, but I still love it, and I'll be watching it at least once a year until the day I die.

In part due to this Blu-Ray release.  I've had a bootleg copy of ""Ishtar"" on DVD for some time, as it was the only (non-VHS) format available.  (Many thanks to that conscientious gent on the internet who, starting with the Italian DVD release, re-tooled it to have no region restrictions, NTSC output, and, by default, the subtitles turned off.)  That copy served me fine for years, but I was still happy to pick up this official Blu-Ray edition, just to support its release, and I couldn't be happier.

The Blu-Ray format is sometimes a pain in the backside, and older (i.e., pre-digital) movies can get butchered during the transfer process, with DNR pancake faces and/or other artifacts caused by artificially increasing the contrast, or audio issues stemming from separating the (in ""Ishtar""'s case, mono) original soundtrack into 5.1 (or greater) surround sound.  But I'm happy to report that this release looks, sounds, and plays great, with (by my relatively snobbish eye) no glaring issues, including playability (on my BD player, at least).  I'm still keeping my bootleg DVD, as I regard DVD as  the more flexible and reliable format, but still, any sanctioned release of this movie in a modern home-video format is an event worth celebrating for us few and proud Ishtarians.

The only complaint I can make is that this BD release contains no extras.  And I mean that literally:  no extras at all, not even a printed insert with a chapter index.  I know, in this world, economics prevails, and for a movie with such a limited cult status and a glaringly red balance sheet, the cost of producing anything other than a bare-bones movie-only release likely wouldn't be justified, but I can still fantasize about a time when this movie has achieved a greater appreciation, and a proper deluxe edition can see the light of day.  This movie is just screaming for interviews and commentary from the director and lead actors, perhaps a documentary about the controversy that all but eternally vanquished this movie into Hollywood's Third Circle of Hell, and you know there has to be hours of terrific outtakes locked away in a vault somewhere.

So let's hope (and lobby) for that long-odds possibility of a proper treatment from Criterion or equivalent, but in the meanwhile, this no-frills release is very easy to get happy about.",1385942400,10,3414,4.8164665523156085

- Musicians and artists will get this music.
- People who know what a joke the U.S. government and foreign policy is will get this movie.
- Anyone who really listens to words in mainstream songs and actually listens to the lyrics will get this movie.

Classic songs lines like, ""If you admit that you can play the accordian, no one will hire you in a rock n' roll band""

The characters that Hoffman and Beatty play... I know guys like this! A strong man (Hoffman) and his stooge (Beatty) and the crazy, life-is-stranger-than-fiction lives they live. They believe their own lies and then, life rises to meet them exactly where they are at and THAT is the magic of it all. They live their dream, they don't sit in a cubicle or listen to naysayers.

If you find the trailer to be gut-busting funny then you will probably love the movie. Beatty and Hoffman work hard but in many ways their efforts serve only to highlight the catastrophically weak and unfunny script. I see many positive reviews for this movie and I genuinely think they have to be fake. By comparison ""Jewel of the Nile"", ""Sahara"" and ""Spies Like Us"" are comedic gems. Oh sorry, was ""Sahara"" not meant to be a comedy? When I watched this movie at the cinema back in 87 it was actually booed during the closing credits by the audience.

Ishtar too is a great comment on how one country's covert meddling in another nation's politics can backfire.

To my knowledge, no one has yet experienced the product ... the Blu-ray release of the movie ""Ishtar"".  A better place to review the movie might be IMDB.  Those rating the product 1 and 2 stars really hate the movie or really hate the DVD region 2 product.  I bought the region 2 DVD clearly understanding what it was. I bought it because at the time there was no other digitized version.

That having been said, I admit I have not yet received my long-awaiting Blu-ray.  I'm rating the movie.

Those rating it 3 stars seemed to overall like it better than a normal 3 star movie but were afraid to give it 4.

Those rating it 4 and 5 stars are clearly nuts ... just like me.  And therefore we are afraid to rate it less for fear of the powers that be who may still change their collective minds yet again and decide NOT to release the Blu-ray.

So I'm not going to give away any of the movie.  Everybody else already has so what's left for me to do?

This is it.  I thought it was funny.  I could analyze it but I don't have to.  It's okay to just think something's funny.  It made me laugh.  It may not make you laugh.  It made me laugh.  And if you don't think it funny, that's okay.  But you're just wrong.  What concerns me is that most people who don't like it, don't like it for the wrong reasons.  That group clearly doesn't understand it.  Those that do understand it and still don't like it, well, at least I can respect that.  But you're still wrong.

The last time I looked at the web site of Ishtar the Movie, there was an unreleased completed version of ""Portable Picnic"" sung by Warren Beatty.  It's just great.  Download it and take a listen. This song, in it's completeness, shows just what Paul Williams and Elaine May were aiming at throughout the rest of the movie.

Hot Fudge Love, You're alway appetizin'
I'm just lookin' for a stove to put my pies in
You are a meal for my heart
You ara a potable picnic

Without seeing the movie, most critics panned it on release, because they were unhappy with Warren Beatty not being a handsome leading man, and because so much was spent on this movie. It was supposed to be an homage to the Hope and Crosby road movies. It's not exactly like one of those - at least I like it much better -- but you can see where they were going. I like the first half of the movie best, as it portrays Beatty and Hoffman as two hapless singer/songwriters who have little talent, but continue to support and encourage each other -- because they both appreciate each other's talent. It's not a sob story, though... the second half of the movie tosses them into screwball situations, and if you can suspend disbelief, their final triumph rounds out the movie's message -- that it's not talent, but perseverance that often leads to success.

Ishtar is funny and has heart which is to me perhaps the most important part of the film. It deals with a couple of regular guys following their dream of becoming songwriters.

All too often we do not follow our dreams. We compromise and do what is safe in the eyes of our friends and families and lie to our self that it is okay to do so. The quote ""You say you would rather have nothing than settle for anything less"" while funny and absurd  really says something. How many of us will one day regret the things we never tried? How many of us will think about this every day of our lives? Rogers and Clark took a shot and although to the public they were not successful, to themselves they were. The message here: live your dream. What has been said by many about this film still remains true:

It is better to be second rate at something you love then to be first rate at something you do not care about. Life is short... Live your dreams.

Now, aside from the underlying message, the film is just damn funny and enjoyable. The songs by  Paul Williams are brilliantly stupid, the quotes are hilariously memorable. You will find yourself quoting both the songs and the lyrics to others throughout the course of your life.

517874,5,6302814146,"I saw this film when it first came out, and before I was aware it was 'awful,' had fallen in love with it. Warren Beatty, for instance, has never been better, playing a rare role as a fumbling sidekick to Hoffman. His tale of woe, about the 'tire factory' in his home town that closed and left him jobless, is the hilarious beginning of his duo song-writing career with Hoffman, and the laughs never let up. My favorite scene was far into the film, when the two of them are hunched in the desert preparing to confront as yet unseen enemies, still making up godawful lyrics that are little more than random rhymes, and Hoffman, engulfed by nostalgia, shouts out, ""We didn't NEED a pencil.""  Another great line comes from Beatty, when the two of them wake up in the blazing, middle eastern desert, heat waves everywhere, and he says portentously,  ""Looks like it's gonna be a scorcher.""

They've left their going-nowhere song writing career in NY to travel to the first available gig their lame, bored manager can get them, in Ishtar of course, and never quite come to terms with the foreignness of it all. Within minutes of arriving in Morocco, they meet a beautiful damsel in distress who steals Hoffman's heart (and passport) while Beatty is in the bathroom, thus launching them into accidental and hilarious paths of cross-purposes from the get-go. It's very much of a Hope/Crosby kind of film, and every bit as lively. Their inimitable blandness is only surpassed by their sweet simple-mindedness as they stumble-bum their way through Morocco with little or no savoir-faire.  Writers of the amazingly bad songs in the film said they learned it's as hard to write memorably bad lyrics as to write good ones. Charles Grodin, who plays the CIA agent who can't believe these guys are for real, is also wonderfully funny.

When I  heard the film was getting panned, I wondered if the middle-eastern motif and the CIA subplots involving accidental and inane murders was some kind of threat to security, but that's hard to believe. However i think it's closer to the truth than stories about Elaine May's not really very unique budget problems. I have no idea either why anyone would consider that she 'squandered' talent. Most viewers won't have time between laughs to take the politics too seriously, and it's a shame this film isn't out on CD by now. Maybe someday.",1357257600,,2364,4.767726161369193
517875,3,6302814146,"Ishtar is one of those movies remembered for its failings, on screen and off. Neither as bad as snobbish, know-all critics of the time had us believe, nor as great as the extremely talented Warren Beatty evidently thought it would be, Ishtar is still an enjoyable movie.

Described at the time as a ""vanity production"" which lost $40 million, Ishtar apparently previewed well, and was number one on its opening weekend, only to be beaten by a b-grade horror movie called The Gate. Stories of rampant egotism, ""creative differences"", and grandscale self-indulgence filled the movie press, and Ishtar ended 1987 as the number one turkey.

Watching it today, free from any need to justify its existence, Ishtar has its moments - how could it not, with stars like Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman and director Elaine May? It deserves credit for trying something different (a romantic comedy with a political subtext, touching on themes of oil and power). I have a soft spot for the film, but would be the first to admit that this isn't Beatty's finest hour - for that, check out Reds, which is a masterpiece.

The dialogue is clever much of the time and there are some really memorable lines (""Most musicians would KILL for a gig in North Africa"") and scenes (the trek across the desert with the blind camel is just hilarious).

At the very least this film is an interesting story with great performances from the two leads.  My wife feels the reason the film gets a bad rap is because the middle of the film has some fat that needed to be trimmed and nearly fell asleep.  Aside from that, she loved the film and I must say that I find it enjoyable as well.  At the time everyone thought it odd that Beatty and Hoffman should play failed singer/songwriters who take a bad gig just to not be complete professional failures.  These two ooze charisma most of the time and audiences just couldn't jive with actors playing not only against type, but playing against likability for the most part.  For this reason people think the movie is a collosal and pathetic misfire.  I think the film stands alone and is an interesting story with great performances it just doesn't pander at all to expectations.  I find it heartwarming and fun.  It's funny in a way that I'd never experienced before and may never again.

I didn't say it was the best, but it definitely was better than what everyone thought of it when it came out in 1987. I was so much following the crowd that I didn't watch this until 1990. It's about a pair of no-talent songwriters who just lost their girlfriends, and are sent to the Middle East by their agent to peddle their songs there, but along the way they get caught up in a political snafu, and all of a sudden they are the key to political life and death not only to the country they're in trying to sell their songs, but their own country the United States. The only thing they ask for in order to restore order is that they be allowed to record a live album of their songs, and all I can say is ""Wow...what power"".

517970,4,6302814146,"I have loved this movie since I was a kid watching it on cable in the 80s.  This movie flopped because of the bad press, not because it's a bad movie.  Sure, it's a little long and there isn't much of a plot, but it has so many weird funny little moments, it's one of my favorite to watch again and again.  I had an old VHS tape that I wore out, and I am very sad I haven't been able to watch this movie for a couple years!  I wish whoever owns the rights would wise up to it's cult status and release it on DVD in America!

Dustin Hoffman is absolutely inspired as Chuck Clarke, a middle-aged dreamer who writes one awful song after another, and has fantasies of becoming the next Art Garfunkel.  One day Chuck meets Lyle (played by Warren Beatty) and an unholy musical partnership is born.  I've never liked Warren Beatty, usually I can't stand to watch the guy, but in my opinion, this is the best thing he's ever done.  He's totally believable as Hoffman's adoring and clueless sidekick.

With songs lyrics like, ""I can see her standing in the backyard of my mind, she cracks her knuckles and the scab that's on her knee won't go away/can see the woman waiting in her eyes and I can see the love but I can't see the Brooklyn Dodgers in LA"" (I'm quoting from memory and haven't seen the movie in at least three years--that's how much I love it!) And...""She said come look, there's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/Take your time, look around, see if there's something your size"" how could you not love this movie?

These guys are two songwriter/performers who love what they do, but unfortunately are completely unaware of how terrible they are.  This does not stop them from trying to book paying gigs, though unfortunately the only gig their deflated agent can get them is singing Simon & Garfunkel tunes in hotel bars in the Middle East.  After their first night, they are a surprise hit with homesick expats and local sheiks alike, and soon grow bold enough to sing their own orginal tunes.  Of course, success rarely comes without a price, and it's no different for Rogers and Clarke.  Somehow they manage to get caught up in a secret mission with CIA agent Jim Harrison (played with brilliant deadpan accuracy by Charles Grodin) and local rebel leader Shirra ""look...what you have!"" Assel (played by Isabelle Adjani).  They think they're playing both sides (and each other) brilliantly, but eventually what they end up doing is wandering the desert with no water on a blind camel.  (I know the feeling well.)

The original Rogers and Clarke song snippets in this movie are hilarious, Beatty is actually funny, and Hoffman is HILARIOUS.  The scene that has him desperately trying to score some water by acting as auctioneer of machine guns to Bedouin traders, all in a dialect he has completely made up, is absolute GOLD.

I miss Ishtar.  I keep checking to see if it's been released on US format DVD yet, still with no luck.  Fools!  Don't they know there's a whole couple of new generations of people who have had no exposure to the pre-emptive (and rumored vendetta) bad press this movie got?

Criticism that the first part of the movie is better than the second is well-taken; however, both parts are better than a lot of movies that have been box-office smashes.

So after twenty years I thought I would see for myself......UGH!.....and boy, was this one dull and not funny movie! What a waste of ability,especially Warren Beatty who truly was ridiculous in his role. Hoffman fares only slightly better. The humor falls absolutely flat and the film is consumed in it's own folly. I kept thinking if Will Ferrell could have made this any funnier. Hoffman and Beatty are two marvelous actors, but this film cannot be saved by their presence. In fact, their presence actually makes the film more impossible to sit through. The blind camel in the desert scene is painful to watch!!!

I was a fan of both Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty at that time, and I am even today. I kept watching this movie and thinking this movie has to get better. These stars are great, there's no way they would perform in a movie without a real story. But they continued to try and wing it and sing along throughout this movie. Have you ever heard these guys sing? Let's just say don't rush out and buy any CDs if they ever made one. Now I have seen comedies were someone can't sing and it is obvious that is part of the comedy. This however just wasn't funny when they sang. So give me any of Mel Brooks, or any other comedy movie, but don't give me Ishtar. Bottom line. If you like it fine, I didn't get their jokes. Perhaps you get it and I don't, perhaps thousands of others like me didn't get it. But when thousands of people did see it and they say it wasn't any good, don't try to say only a few really saw it and know if it is any good. Many people saw it based on the stars Beatty and Hoffman, and many people said it was one of their least favorites. If more felt it didn't flop it would have made the money they poured into it back.

Or perhaps these are simply people who can recognize when music is bad, and can make the fine line distinction between ""bad music,"" and music that's so bad it's brilliant.

This movie - if you get it - will make you choke, you're laughing so hard. Two ""musicians"" (Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman), of slightly sub-average intelligence and slightly sub-levels of musical talent, come together to form a very bad lounge act. The lounge act is very, VERY bad (but not so bad that its insipidness looks deliberate), and these two very earnest fellows put their hearts into writing perhaps the worst (or best) songs every written, then performing them. You have to see the movie twice because the first time you hear their songs you'll be laughing too hard to listen closely.

Somehow this very bad lounge act gets a gig in the Middle East, and is drawn into the political situation. The movie then follows two very earnest fellows of slightly sub-average intelligence and talent as they play in Middle Easter hotel lounges while also playing the part of spies.

The CIA is playing high stakes chess with communist revolutionaries as Beatty and Hoffman wander lost through the desert on a blind camel.

 Every scene crackles with quotable dialogue and gut-busting slapstick. A personal favorite line comes when Hoffman is on the ledge of his apartment building threatening suicide:

Beatty: [to Hoffman] It takes a lot of nerve to have nothing at your age, don't you understand that? Most guys'd be ashamed, but you've got the guts to just say ""to hell with it""! You say that you'd rather have nothing than settle for less...

 A scene stealing turn from Charles Grodin as a CIA agent is played with dry perfection. He's never been better.

 Ishtar failed at the box office because of it's budget, plain and simple. It was a laughing stock doomed to bomb before it ever came out, despite three successful previews to audiences who loved it. Every bad review was based on the budget and the resulting negative hype. Don't believe it.

518061,5,6302814146,"Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman are brilliant and charismatic in this side-splitting buddy farce about the fantastic misadventures of two passionate, sincere, severely deluded songwriters attempting to become the next Simon and Garfunkel. Recognizing the duo's complete lack of talent, their agent books them a gig in the only place he can: Morocco. Through a series of absurd mishaps, they become embroiled in revolutionary espionage. The CIA is playing high stakes chess with communist revolutionaries as Beatty and Hoffman wander lost through the desert on a blind camel.

 Every scene crackles with quotable dialogue and gut-busting slapstick. A personal favorite line comes when Hoffman is on the ledge of his apartment building threatening suicide:

Beatty: [to Hoffman] It takes a lot of nerve to have nothing at your age, don't you understand that? Most guys'd be ashamed, but you've got the guts to just say ""to hell with it""! You say that you'd rather have nothing than settle for less...

 A scene stealing turn from Charles Grodin as a CIA agent is played with dry perfection. He's never been better.

 Ishtar failed at the box office because of it's budget, plain and simple. It was a laughing stock doomed to bomb before it ever came out, despite three successful previews to audiences who loved it. Every bad review was based on the budget and the resulting negative hype. Don't believe it.

Or just before that, the scene with the vultures flying on and off camera when The Hawk (Hoffman) lands face down in the sand after hours of wandering in the desert, and Lyle (Beatty) has to shoo them away.

When it comes up in conversation, and people moan or say ""that was awful,"" I ask, ""Did you actually see it?"" And often the answer is ""No, but I heard...""  Please. This is a brilliant, hilarious movie. It was also one of the first comedies ever to have such a large budget and it came along at a time when the media was first even talking a lot about how big a budget was, in reference to movies. I've always been mystified as to why this movie was so reviled when it's endearing and oh so funny.  Not being a particular fan of either Beatty or Hoffman, you just have to give them big mad props for the incredible portrayals in this movie. PLEASE, we need a DVD release for U.S. players...with the goodies and the long, lost musical video included!  I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Elaine May a few years after Ishtar came out and she seemed to still be besieged by the naysayers.  What a shame...what a bewildering shame. The funniest thing about this movie are the song lyrics and their deadpan, oh-so-serious delivery:

Telling the truth can be dangerous business

honest and popular don't go hand and hand

If you admit you can play the accordian,

no one will hire you for a rock and roll band...

It is a really funny movie.

I think Ishtar's biggest problem is that it was ahead of its time. In the 90's, silly movies about a duo of idiots were commonplace, and actors like Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, and Jim Carrey were practically creating a new genre of idiot buddy films. I believe that if Ishtar had been made in 1995 starring Chris Farley and Adam Sandler, it would have been a hit. Instead, it was released in '87, starring two of the best leading men of the time. And they were playing idiots. Idiots that failed at everything they tried. And the viewing public just didn't know what to make of it.

If you have never seen this movie, you must. Give it a chance - it's a heck of a lot funnier than Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Boy, and Happy Gilmore -and they all made a bank.",1116892800,4,1047,4.147783251231527

Beatty and Hoffman were perfectly clueless, talentless, and lovable but awful songwriters.  Charles Grodin was his usual hilarious self.  Marty Fried, their agent, (don't recall the actor's name) was also right on and it took a lot of talent to write such badly memorable songs.

My family thinks I'm insane for liking this movie but they insist that I bring Ishtar to beach week every year.  It's a family tradition.  We know all the lines.  We know all the songs and we can't help but sing them!  Glad I'm not alone in my fanatacism.  Please please please put it out on DVD.",1113264000,7,838,4.601351351351352

It has been my experience that movies, and especially comedies, must be watched more than once to get an accurate feel for the artistry and talents contained in them. On the second viewing one can usually tell whether a third viewing is tolerable. Ishtar withstands the test of multiple viewings and I have watched it many times. Close seconds to Elaine May are the talents of both Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. Two talented actors play goofy guys with big dreams similar to the ones we all have. They stumble around giving us many laughs until they succeed which is even funnier. What could be more entertaining? Considering the ongoing political situation in the Middle East this film also contains contemporary humorous issues. I own my own VHS copy and hope to add the DVD to my collection.

518085,3,6302814146,"Everyone always recalls to mind ""Ishtar"" as synomymous with flop, big-budget turkey, desert disaster, quite possibly the worst film ever made.  Allow me to unmask the myth:

I have seen MANY recent movies made that were far worse than these with violence and content and incoherent plots.  This is not an offensive film, it is a comedy.  Take life with a little laughter.  The first 30 minutes are a blast!  Rogers and Clark are hapless - Clark a hip New Yorker who goes by the nickname ""Hawk"" and Rogers - a naive Texan who writes songs while driving the Good Humor Truck and is finally abandoned by his wife.  The lines are fast and snappy and the songs are so wrought with such agonizing and unsuccessful effort - you laugh until the tears flow!  These guys could have written good jingles for commercials - ""Hot Fudge Love"", ""Software"", and ""I'm Leaving some Love in My Will.""  The hapless script twists when Rogers and Clark are sent to Northern Africa for a gig at the Chez Casablanca.  Now, Chuck Clark is too wary a character to exchange his identity with anyone  - even a beautiful woman - but if he didn't, we wouldn't have Ishtar and ""Telling the Truth can be Dangerous Business.""  Do yourself a favor:  see it once in your life, be over and done with it.",1105488000,,1266,4.5
518086,5,6302814146,"My wife and I saw Ishtar in Denver when it first premiered, and were howling with laughter with tears streaming down our cheeks from the very first notes of the film.  The theatre was packed - not an empty seat in the house - and people were turning around in their seats to see who these lunatics were that were THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE THEATRE who were laughing!  To this day, I find it incredible that so few people find Ishtar to be so outrageously funny.  Thankfully, our numbers are growing.

My wife and I are both artists - she a musician and I am a creative director, so we can both appreciate what happens during collaborations and brainstorming sessions - it has been hilariously captured on film here; and cudos to Elaine May and Paul Williams for writing such brilliantly awful songs!  It is not easy to write a bad song so well.  To this day, I can start to chuckle out loud just thinking about Warren Beatty's character, Lyle on stage singing ""hoopa, hoopa, hoopa, hoopa!"" with Dustin Hoffman.

This movie is wonderful:  Photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro; directed by Elaine May; score by Dave Grusin; starring Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Adjani, Jack Weston, and Charles Grodin; songs by Paul Williams, Elaine May, Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty.  And Hoffman and Beatty are playing the piano themselves.

Perhaps Elaine May went a bit overboard with her spending - a reported $5Million for the bar set alone, but this movie does not deserve the reputation it has.  Not by a long shot.  This is truly one of the funniest movies ever made!

Too many were put off by the big budget and high expectations, and were swayed by torching reviews. This film taught me to take each and every review for what it is: one person's opinion.

There are far too many classic lines from this film to note in one place. Among them ""who told you that? The secretary of state? How would he know?"" Also, song lyrics like ""I'm quitting high school, 'cause you don't love me.""

Any musician who ever played a solo or duo in a crummy club can appreciate poor Lyle in the cafe by himself playing songs from the Simon and Garfunkel song book, only to be heckled by American tourists demanding That's Amore.

Pray, do not misunderstand my glowing appraisal of this masterpiece.  I do not mean that it was well-made or well-written or well-acted by any stretch of the imagination.  Rather I mean that the stupidity and futility of this movie is truly comic.  All the horrendous facets combine to create a movie, which is, in a larger sense, a much funnier, much more cultured Dumb and Dumber.
In a larger sense, perhaps this movie is a comment on the futility of art, and of politics, and of life itself.  We try to achieve success through doing what we love; we try to achieve success through relationships with other people; we try to achieve success by taking advantage of all the opportunities we are presented with.  But in the end none of these things is a sure investment.  The only thing that is guaranteed to bring us success and happiness is, as this movie so clearly demonstrates, an ancient, much-coveted artifact which we happen to acquire.

Lyle and Chuck are arguably the world's worst lounge singers, and they end up involved in Morocco doing government spy work.  But I am not here to convince you to watch ""Ishtar"" because of the plot, or the performance of the two leading men.  You have to check this out for the songs.

Here are some sample lyrics:
Telling the truth can be dangerous business;
Honest and popular don't go hand in hand.
If you admit that you play the accordion,
No one will hire you in a rock 'n' roll band.
But we can sing out hearts out.
And if we're lucky, then no neighbors complain.
Because life is the way we audition for God;
Let us pray that we all get the job.
Every time Beatty and Hoffman struggle through singing their songs, or even better, trying to compose their songs, finding the proper inane lyric to match the insipid music, you have to laugh, chuckle, or at least wince in pain.

518177,5,6302814146,"I saw this movie opening weekend because I had read interviews with Hoffman, Beatty etc., and the idea appealed to me.  I loved it, raved about it to friends & family.  Then the reviews came out, bashing it mercilessly.  Nearly every review started with a comment about how expensive it was and how much Hoffman & Beatty got paid.  The main sentiment seemed to have been outrage at the cost, and that no comedy could live up to that pricetag.  My best friend and I became convinced that we were the only two people in the world who understood this movie and found it hysterical.  ""The roof of the emir's palace is gold, but the people have never seen a refrigerator,"" and ""No sir, no sir, we did NOT shoot at two Americans in the desert,"" were two of our favorite catch phrases for years.
The writing is first rate.  The ""pop songs"" written by the two main characters are painfully funny.  The two leads demonstrate that they were not afraid to make total fools of themselves for the sake of the film.  Warren Beatty as a shy, polite, southern boy who's not very good with women ... Dustin Hoffman as a man who believes himself on the verge of that break that will catapult him to stardom ... the supporting cast of Isabel Adjani, Carol Kane, Charles Grodin, Matt Frewer (Max Headroom) spot-on.
You have to have a strong sense of the absurd to enjoy this movie, and an appreciation of withering satire is a must.  If you like the original cast Saturday Night Live ... if you like satire and wit of Monty Python ... do yourself a favor and see this movie!",1010966400,,1554,4.421052631578948
518178,4,6302814146,"HARRY: I first saw this film during it's sneak preview.  The songs and their performances practically had me rolling on the floor with laughter, and the audience was cracking up throughout.
Then the reviews came out, totally panning it.
I saw it again after it's official release.  Nobody was laughing.

518209,4,6302814146,"Just like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this film has a love or hate it attitude. Who can ever forget the Simon & Garfunkle duet wannabes that Hoffman and Beatty were in Ishtar and who can forget and not love ""Hot Fudge Love...Cherry Ripple Kisses"", and ""Telling the Truth Can Be Dangerous Buisness"".  It seemed like the critics took that last song to heart during the unfair reviews of the movie after its release in 1987.  I would bet half of them are closet Ishtar lovers, and hum a few of the classic song lines at Christmas parties.  For those of us that got it, in my case three of my friends in a crowded theatre in Dallas, Texas.  It was one of the funniest films of the decade.  Tears came to our eyes when the two duped musicians working unbeknown to them for the CIA, are offered the choice of a blind camel or one that is crippled.  Yes, the plot was a farce, but it was meant to be, and I actually like watching a movie in which it is clear the actors are having a fun time with it.  Ishtar was not made to win an Academy Award.  It was made to entertain, and that it did well in my opinion.  So, if your ever in Morocco looking to buy beads that glow in the dark or simply want to overthrow the current regime in Ishtar, go by the lounge where Stevens and Clark are playing and you are sure to have a great time.",984355200,11,1327,4.112403100775194
518210,5,6302814146,"Ishtar is the most wrongfully maligned movie of all time.  Warren Beatty  and Dustin Hoffman are hilarious in this buddy farce about the fantastic misadventures of two passionate, sincere songwriters who can niether sing nor write, but who truly  think they're great, think they're Simon and Garfunkel.  The deluded duo can't get a gig anywhere but Morocco, where they become entangled in a revolutionary espionage and ride around the desert on a blind camel.  Ishtar was the movie which made me decide to like Warren Beatty.  He and Hoffman have dynamic charisma together, each playing their characters with endearing sincerity, which adds to the hilarity.  Every scene crackles with memorable dialogue and slapstick gags.  One of my personal favorite lines comes when Hoffman is threatening to kill himself because he has nothing.  Beatty tells him that that's what's great about him. ""You're the kind of guy who'd rather have nothing than settle for less.""  Ishtar was a financial failure because it went way over budget and was poorly marketed.  It was doomed  to ""bomb"" before it ever came out.  But what does that matter to us, now?  The fact is that this classic comedy is in league with all of your favorites, and you're only depriving yourself of a lot of good belly laughs if you don't give Ishtar a look.",979257600,84,1315,4.891402714932127
518211,4,6302814146,"I suppose that other comedies such as Blazing Saddles, The Jerk and History of the World received their accolades because they did exactly what was expected of them...to make people laugh at idiotic characters and classic jokes.
But...I also guess I'm not sure what was expected of Ishtar.  It received awful, awful reviews and everyone laughs at me for considering this one of my favorite comedies.  However, this movie is absolutely hilarious!  Therefore...it did exactly what it set out to do.  Yes...Hoffman was brilliant in The Graduate and Beatty goes without saying.  But, I also think that these two characters play off each other perfectly.  It's a comedy...not Gone With the Wind.
You can read the other reviews to get the plot so I won't go over that again.  The bottom-line is...Who cares about the plot?!  Just buy this movie, sit on your couch, and be prepared to enjoy some great, classic comedy.  Imagine Hoffman and Beatty singing songs like ""I'm Leaving Some Love in My Will"" (to an elderly couple on their 50th anniversary) and ""Wardrobe of Love"" (""come on in and see if you can find something in your size"") with a completely straight face, as if Simon and Garfunkel would cry at these tunes.
And I also agree with the other reviews.  ""Dangerous Business"" would be a smash hit if it came out in the late 70s-early 80s!  Which reminds me...if I'm not mistaken, Neil Simon (Neil Diamond...someone like that!) wrote the songs!  You've absolutely gotta buy this movie.  If nothing else, you can claim that you own a copy of the movie touted as worst ever.  BUY THIS FILM!

518212,5,6302814146,"Sadly, ""Ishtar"" is a completely misunderstood movie by way of the critics.  If one takes it for what it is, one will see that it is purely a parody (and a very funny one at that).  Hoffman and Beatty are  brilliant in their ability to act so terribly dense and untalented and play  it all with a straight face.  They play songwriters who aspire to be  famous, and they truly believe that their songs such as ""Wardrobe of  Love"" and ""Dangerous Buisness"" could be sung by Simon and  Garfunkel themselves.  Charles Grodin gives a brilliant performance as the  butt-kissing CIA agent, and Elaine May wrote the clever script that is  filled with witty remarks and totally hysterical action.  ""Ishtar"" is up there with all the other great screwball comedies  such as ""The Producers"" and ""Some Like it Hot"".  I've  never laughed so hard while viewing a movie before.

Perhaps one of the greatest comedies ever made, it's really ironic that so many people missed the boat. I can only suspect that there were giant chips on reviewers and viewers  shoulders at the budget and the inisitence of Hoffman and Beatty at doing  film-only interviews.
It is possibly their best work. And the two play  off each other as well as any other star tandem ever has, maybe better.  Others have made the point that Americans don't like to see stars play  losers in film. And two more pathetic, yet loveable losers like Chuck and  Lyle can't be found. This is a smart, witty, funny, and ultimately  uplifting film. The supporting cast is great as well, and it's the kind of  dialogue that you will replay in your mind for years to come. And the songs  -- ""Wardrobe of Love"", ""Dangerous Business"",  ""Mecca""...they stay with you forever --haunting, awful, and funny  as hell.
Not only am I not ashamed, but I'm proud to admit that this is  one of my favorite comedies of all time. It ranks with King of Comedy and  Raising Arizona in my book.",953683200,9,1170,4.488151658767772

Beatty is endearingly cloddish, Hoffman flashes that  patented pained smile of his, and the terrible songs they write are just  perfect. Plus: anybody who can watch those buzzards running back and forth  through the frame without laughing must be impervious to amusement.

We still watch the movie at least twice a year and  know the dialogue and songs by heart.

Hoffman  and Beatty are quite amusing, especially in the opening sequences, when  they sing Paul Williams's ""awful"" songs; appropriately, the  characters' desires to become ""well-regarded musicians"" are so  strong that they attempt to turn EVERYTHING into lyrics. Still, the songs  should be much funnier than they are, and the ""adventure""  sequences in the desert grow boring and convoluted about fifty minutes into  the picture.

There are two kinds of people in this world - those who think Ishtar is a religiously funny experience and watch regularly, and those that don't.

It's sad that critics are not sophisticated enough to recognize farce, but  it makes the joy of watching this film every year with the same group of  friends even more delicious - one of the great pleasures of life.
The  scene with Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman crawling across an obvious  soundstage made up to look like the desert on their hands and knees, with  buzzards stumbling in and out of the frame obviously being thrown back into  the frame from either side by stagehands is so pathetic, it's hysterical,  particularly when Hoffman announces that he's depressed.
