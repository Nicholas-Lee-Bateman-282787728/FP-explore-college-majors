The film begins in a city at night. A man walks into the police station or report a murder. ""Who is dead?"" they ask. ""I am."" Frank Bigelow tells his story. He lives in Banning, a small town near the desert where he is an accountant. He will travel to San Francisco on a vacation. Paula Gibson is upset by this news. Will they get married? Frank arrives in San Francisco, the St. Francis Hotel is crowded with buyers (post-war prosperity). He gets a call from the office, a Mr. Phillips wants to talk to him. Salesmen are meeting buyers in a holiday atmosphere party. They visit bars to hear jazz. The musicians play as in a frenzy. [Did someone switch glasses?] Are the jive fans being mocked? The next morning Frank doesn't feel well. He walks the streets to the Medical Center for tests.

A nurse stares at this patient. The doctors tell of luminous toxin in his system, there is no antidote or cure! And only a few days to live! Frank is in denial. There is another diagnostic. This is not an accident! The city streets have little traffic. You can see the reflection of the green-and-white buses in the store windows. Paula calls to tell him that Mr. Phillips just died last night in Los Angeles. A DC-3 flies through the air. Frank goes to see Mr. Phillips office. Comptroller Halliday speaks to him. Phillips died in a fall from his apartment. His widow knows nothing. Phillips had been arrested for dealing in stolen iridium. Frank notarized a bill of sale from Mr. George Reynolds years ago. Frank searches for clues about Reynolds. Someone shoots at him, Frank grabs his revolver and shoots back. Back at his hotel strange men kidnap him. Paula calls again. These men take him to see Mr. Majack, they speak. Chester is psychopathic. [Is that name Armenian?] Majack explains his options.

Chester takes Frank for a ride in a car. But Frank puts the brakes to that. Chester waves a pistol in a drugstore, a policemen puts a stop to that. Paula goes to meet him. Is he feverish? The Homicide detective had called. Frank goes to see Stanley, and learns more about the plot and the guilty parties. He goes to see Mrs. Phillips and learns about the deal for iridium. Majack shows up with his boys. Frank flees on a bus to escape them. Frank goes to see Halliday, but they say little. The story returns to the police station, and then stops speaking. The Missing Person Report is stamped ""Dead On Arrival"". The film explains there is a poison called ""luminous toxin"" but don't name it so people won't be tempted to use it.

This is a near perfect story with little padding (except for the jazz club scenes). Iridium is a rare metal that may be used by the military. A phosphorous compound could glow in the dark (""The Hound of the Baskervilles""). [A radium compound was used for luminescent watch dials. It poisoned hundreds of the factory workers who used it.] The film shows San Francisco at night when few people were around and the streets were uncrowded. Note how businessmen carried pistols in their daily activities. The moral of this story is to always guard your food and drink when in a public place, like a bar, restaurant, cafeteria, etc. Sex and money (or lust and greed) are the prime motives for murder in general, and in this story.
