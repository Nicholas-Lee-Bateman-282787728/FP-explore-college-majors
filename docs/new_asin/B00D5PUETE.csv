5774993,5,B00D5PUETE,"What makes these films work is that they change the plot every time.  The first one was a classic exercise in paranoia and isolation.  The second one was more like an action film with lots of explosions and a small army of monsters.  The third one was about animal rights and learning how to coexist with dangerous species.  I admit I haven't seen the fourth movie or the TV series yet.

I loved how the third movie wasn't afraid to make fun of the first.  The minor characters got lots of names wrong and that made it more believeable that the main characters stopped maintaining their anti-graboid equipment.  It's amazing how quickly people get back to normal after a disaster; I do it myself a lot, too.  The names of the creatures are a lot of fun, except for 'Shrieker'.  That one doesn't fit with 'Graboid' and 'Ass-Blaster'.  Oh, well.  I do wish the government drones had been more fleshed out.  The last we heard from them they were trying to humbly ask Burt for help, and he just insulted them and stormed off.  Maybe if he'd been willing to talk to them things wouldn't have gotten out of hand.  I might be the only one to interpret that scene like that, though.",1402099200,,1174,4.450704225352113
5774994,4,B00D5PUETE,I liked this one... but don't waste your time with the next one or the failed TV episodes of Tremors. They wore me and the plot out..,1398211200,,133,3.962962962962963
5774995,4,B00D5PUETE,"i wouldn't say this film is bad, but it is not superb either. it is watchable for sure but you have to like the first tremors to ppreciate this one. there are consistencies from the first which help the film have value. the writers appeared to be exercising their creative imaginations evidently for this third chapter- they took several aspects from the first one & built up on that to make a continuation possible. perhaps when they were writing the original they predicted a sequel & purposely left things open for continuating interpretation. i thought including the endangered species aspect was constructive for the story, & makes sense that in reality it likely would be controversial given the hostility of the creature against humans. after all, those worms are rare & prehistoric so the animal rights twist seems a smart touchstone for the plot dynamics. i think this one would have been better as the sequel rather than tremors 2. the character Burt (michael gross)seems to have taken the stronghold, and he's certainly likable but i personally liked kevin bacon the best from the original movie, but Burt was the better choice over Fred Ward's character. they've had a tv series going for some time now, so those are interesting to watch too",1391385600,,1253,4.887323943661972
5774996,1,B00D5PUETE,A last resort for a snow day. Creatures look like they were made from Spore. Dialog and acting beyond cheesy. Watch something else.,1390953600,,131,4.739130434782608
5774997,5,B00D5PUETE,"My favorite movie series.  I love tremors, even if it is a bust!  Kevin Bacon should have went all three of them!",1386288000,,113,4.090909090909091
5774998,3,B00D5PUETE,"You simply must see Tremors 3 if you saw Tremors 2. And don't look at the silly review, the worst review the better in this case. Classic.",1476144000,,138,4.148148148148148
5774999,5,B00D5PUETE,"This movie lives up to the hype of the first 2 and takes it to a new level as the Graboids continue to evolve. It's action packed with the right balance of humor, action, and drama/horror that isn't over the top. Strongly recommend if you liked the first two Tremor movies.",1475539200,,273,4.372549019607843

5775011,5,B00D5PUETE,"I love the whole series of Tremors movies. Can't say for sure what it is about them specifically...maybe it's my nostalgia from watching the first Tremors as a kid. But anytime I watch any of the movies from this series, I'm always put in a good mood, feeling perfectly comfortable just sitting on the couch and ready to watch the next one in the series again.",1446076800,,360,4.46969696969697

5775021,4,B00D5PUETE,"I'm a big fan of the ""Tremors"" series and tv show. If you are a fan of the show, and haven't watch this movie yet, it's a must watch. It explains a lot of the plot points from the tv show. If you are just a fan of the series, then this is still a enjoyable watch. Not a movie to watch on it's own, Go back and watch part 1 and 2 first to get the most out of this movie. It's not the best of the series, but still good enough to watch. More for a netflix view, but diehard fans a must own. This also the first time ever this movie has come out with a spanish language track. All of the other films have a spanish language track except for this one, until now.",1424822400,,658,3.7753623188405796
