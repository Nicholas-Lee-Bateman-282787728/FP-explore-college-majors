2923193,2,B000UNYJRW,"I was expecting another piece of low-budget romantic fluff and for the first twenty minutes or so that's all I got. I was surprised, however, to see that, while there are certainly abundant sappy, clichd elements throughout the film, there are also some unexpected pithy moments sprinkled in as well -- enough to keep me from popping the disc out and totally dismissing it as ""just more of the same.""  Some real relationship issues are addressed and, while the plot line becomes implausible yet predictable before the whole thing is over, some scenes are actually nicely acted and very touching, and it's just a shame they're mostly outweighed by the mediocrity of rest of the film. Unless you're a big fan of lightweight romantic date flicks, just rent this one.",1194480000,14,763,4.869230769230769

2923216,5,B000UNYJRW,"Given that most contemporary ""queer cinema"" is crap, I am quite happy to say that this lovely little movie can hold its own with the best of the best.  It belongs in the class of ""Parting Glances"" (1986) and ""Latter Days"" (2003).  The chemistry between the two leads is the stuff dreams are made on.  Congratulations to the writer, director, and all the actors of this winning movie.  I have never experienced a long-term relationship....not even a guy about whom I felt romantic who returned my feelings in like manner.  While this little movie speaks directly and deeply to romantic idealist viewers like me, its audience is vast and will include anyone who has ever felt romantic love for another human being.",1434326400,2,712,4.80327868852459

2923228,2,B000UNYJRW,"I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this one.  There was basically zero chemistry between the two leads.  Matthew Montgomery was fine as always, but his partner was wooden at best.  There are so many missteps in the script that I won't go into details.  But the overarching premise of the movie is what I found so offensive.  It posits the bad promiscuous gay man vs the good gay man in an LTR (even one with no sexual compatibility).  It is either/or, black or white thinking at its most insidious -- and it's anti sexual pleasure stance dates from sometime in the last century.  Why is sexual pleasure still suspect even in a so-called gay romance? Why shouldn't gay men strive to have it all?",1407715200,2,697,4.484126984126984
2923229,5,B000UNYJRW,"I can't decide whether this new genre of gay films is modeled on the screwball comedies of the '30s or just well written romance comedies from the '80s and '90s, but whatever they're doing, it's working. For me, anyway. I think what I'm sensing in terms of the screwball comedies (Hepburn and Spencer Tracy or Cary Grant) is the comfort with gay characters and the willingness to present them as regular folks, like anyone else. And of course, there's the really tender angle characteristic of the more recent romance comedies (Richard Gere, Hugh Grant). If you want unrelenting camp, don't stop here. If you want things blowing up and people dying violent deaths right and left, don't stop here. But, if you want a romantic story well told, this is it. (And Big Eden, Redwoods, What Happens Next, even Coffee Date) I'm discovering that it's no coincidence that several of my favorites feature Matthew Montgomery.",1404864000,2,913,4.896774193548387

Glenn...who has enjoyed his share of flings and short-term relationships, meets Adam through an ad in the personals of a gay newspaper.  They finally connect, and have several dates before hopping into bed...a hop that doesn't work out all that well.  But not deterred, both move forward with their developing relationship.  Add a ""meet the parents"" segment, the struggles of cell phone interference, a funeral on the other side of the country, a retaliatory one-night-stand, and an overheard conversation and you have the makings of a break-up.  Glenn finally decides marriage is the answer, and the wedding scene will make you cry.

2923243,3,B000UNYJRW,"A cute storyline, sometimes formulaic but surprisingly sweet. Relationships are no easy thing and perhaps they are even more difficult for gay men. The movie explores the issues surrounding one man seeking to drop his old swinging ways for a stab at a couple's life. There are bruises and bumps along this road. If you can overlook that this film is not available in HD, has some recurring cliches, and some rough dialogue and acting in spots, then you might enjoy the storyline.",1379203200,2,479,4.783132530120482
2923244,5,B000UNYJRW,"I love this film. I bought it. Two men find each other through the personals. The much anticipated sex is a disaster. The film takes a critical look at the ""gay"" scene and even questions the importance of physical sex versus  genuine love in a relationship. Can two men have a loving partnership without great sex?",1378771200,4,314,4.607142857142857

2923246,4,B000UNYJRW,"I chose this movie because I admire Matthew Montgomery.  I have found his work enlightening about understanding the Gay community and the issues within.  Watching a younger Matthew was fascinating. Matthews expressive eyes convey the emotions experienced by the character; in this way, he provides greater depth and understanding.  He also exhibits the many small gestures /movements that are pure Matthew Montgomery. He has a unique way of making the character his own, and has refined this ability as his career advanced.  In this romantic-comedy, Matthew plays Glenn, a young Gay man unhappy with his life of sex without commitment.  Vincent (Jeremy Lucus), Glenns roommate, finds an ad in the personals of a man seeking a long-term relationship. Glenn contacts Adam (Windham Beacham) and thus begins their rocky road towards a relationship (which includes seemingly incompatible sex).  I was sad for Vincent in this movie, but life does not always provide happy endings for everyone in a given situation.  Additional supporting cast includes Artie ODaley (Eli) and Chuti Tiu (Mary Margaret).  I enjoyed watching this movie.",1378252800,3,1127,5.363636363636363
2923247,5,B000UNYJRW,I love Rob's movies. This is so romantic and fiunny.  It makes you think romance is alive and well in this movie. To me 5 stars is not enough.,1377907200,,142,3.896551724137931
2923248,5,B000UNYJRW,"I don't think anyone actually falls in love until 5 years have gone by. Before that it's mostly limerence and lust. So this movie is about the beginning of a relationship between two men who must begin negotiating all the things you must when you're just starting out. It''s another kind of coming out at a deeper level to just one special person. Even if you've come out to everyone around you, when you begin a new relationship that you hope will last a lifetime, there's a deeper coming out process where you share the deepest things with another person. You become vulnerable to another person. It's a tender and sometimes unsettling process of moving into having a partner.",1376956800,2,678,4.705882352941177
2923249,5,B000UNYJRW,"Its about time a movie is made that ends happy! It not only shows us that 2 people in love can over come any obstacles, it shows that a same sex couples love is as strong as ANY other type of union. Hats off to the makers of this film.",1376784000,4,235,3.72

2923251,4,B000UNYJRW,"This  is a feel good kind of movie, which isn't common in this genre. Sometimes you just want to watch a couple end up together and happy. The main characters are easy on the eye which makes watching a pleasure and they have good onscreen chemistry. The one has what's supposed to be a Southern-Atlanta-accent which isn't very good but he's so adorable I just ignored it. I'm a hetero female and love romance in all it's forms and this one I will absolutely watch again. The trials the characters go through are realistic and and it's nice to watch their relationship develop. All around a few hours well spent!",1376179200,7,611,4.554545454545455
2923252,5,B000UNYJRW,This is the second time I've seen this movie.  Unlike other gay movies this one is moving and touches into monogamy and how you really have to work hard at a relationship to achieve it.,1374796800,6,185,4.285714285714286
2923253,5,B000UNYJRW,"Of all the films I had seen prior to this starring Matthew Montgomery including ""Gone But Not Forgotten"", ""Redwoods"", ""Role Play"", etc., this  is hands down my favorite, and just for the record, it's not because it features full frontal nudity of Montgomery lol).

From his spot on portrayal of a gay man tired of his shallow sexual experiences and hungry for a meaningful relationship, Glenn (Matthew Montgomery) meets his soulmate Adam (Windham Beacham), through a personal ad.  The relationship hits a rocky road when Glenn finds out that Adam is a Republican.  ""Gay Republican"" seems like an oxymoron to Glenn who just can't imagine why Adam would be affiliated with a political party that he perceives as homophobic and totally anti-Gay.

But even after Glenn agrees to move beyond this anomaly and allows the relationship to continue, an even greater deal breaker occurs when Glenn thinks that Adam has stood him up on Valentine's Day. He goes to Adam's house with a beautiful bouquet of roses for their planned romantic date only to find out that Adam is not home.  Adam had actually left Glenn a message earlier that day to tell him why he couldn't keep the Valentine's Day date, but when the voice message was retrieved by Glenn's best friend and house mate it was all muffled due to a technical issue, so his roommate just deleted it without paying any attention to whom it was or mentioning it to Glenn.

Assuming that Adam has dismissed him, Glenn winds up going out for the night depressed and in need of company, so he has a sexual tryst with an old ""booty buddy"". Subsequently, when Glenn finds out the actual reason why Adam couldn't keep their Valentine's Day date, Glenn is ridden with embarrassment, guilt, shame, and fear that Adam will never forgive him for not waiting to find out what really happened.

Can their love triumph over all these difficult obstacles?  No more spoilers here, just a recommendation that you treat yourself to a viewing of this delightfully sweet romantic comedy.",1373500800,,2011,4.8226744186046515
2923254,3,B000UNYJRW,"I liked the story and Mr Montgomery, but to me, he was not paired with the proper partner. This person didn't appear to be his type to me. He seemed to be acting the part, for me it was not believable. The storyline was sound but I was disappointed in the acting.

2923259,3,B000UNYJRW,"I watched this movie with a friend a few days ago.  I'd never heard of it; didn't know anything about it.  As I sat through the obligatory gay scenes of being with my own clique, trying to find someone, answering a personal's ad, etc. etc., I thought, ""Oh brother; this is gonna' be bad.""  And you know what?  I was WRONG.

No, that doesn't mean this was a masterpiece--by ANY means.  Was the dialogue stilted?  You bet?  Were the characters as cookie-cutter as they could possibly be?  On the nosey!  Did I want to slap most of them until my arms got tired?  Hell yeah.  But to see a gay-themed movie that actually PROMOTED a LTR--complete with characters who tried their best to destroy it--but failed--I really enjoyed myself.  Most of my friends can't define what would entail a relationship (let alone a long-term one) and to see a movie where the main characters actually cared about being with one another was very refreshing.  And as predictable as it might have been, I love a happy ending!

2923260,2,B000UNYJRW,"Based on the good reviews here I watched this movie (altho I was hesitant because Gone but Not Forgotten, another Matthew Montgomery movie, sucked majorly) and was disappointed. The premise seemed ok. But just ok. The acting was meh. Background music was a little weird. Direction... ok. As others have said, there was some nudity. But even that was boring. I couldn't help but start to surf the web after 15 mins. And really started surfing the web after 30 mins. I'm writing this review as the movie plays actually.

Nothing in the movie holds your attention. The manufactured drama. The rare bits of comedy. Nothing. It's boring. And I'm not certain what would make this movie better. I don't want to be mean, but maybe better acting, scripting, direction, music, even cinematogrophy. Maybe if there were a few stellar things like acting, or the script or the location shoots, then one might be more interested. And I do realize it's low budget, but there are other low budget movies that held my attention better but were more bare bones in sets.",1294099200,,1050,4.769230769230769
2923261,3,B000UNYJRW,"""Long Term Relationship"" combines elements of similar film s such as ""Broken Hearts Club,"" ""Latter Days,"" and ""Jeffrey,"" and succeeds on its own, due mainly to Matthew Montgomery's sensitive and humorous portrayal of Glenn, a cute  twenty-something LA gay who wants to quit the trolling and have a real relationship. Through a personal ad, Glenn meets Adam, a Mr. Right who may turn out to be a Mr. Not-So-Right due to some compatibility issues. Also included in the mix are Glenn's friends and a roommate who wants more than a friendship. The biggest flaw is the slow-pacing of the story and some predictable plot turns. Worth a look for sure, but ""Latter Days"" remains the best of this genre.",1287014400,,694,4.831932773109243
2923262,5,B000UNYJRW,"Long-Term Relationship is a small budget movie (I believe to recognize the same house used in another movie of the same director...), but with a good plot and nice actors, not overly beautiful, but enough particulars to understand why they are in their role. And then this is a real gay romance movie, with a real love story, and when I say real I mean that it shows that not always love at first sight is enough to build a long term relationship.",1278288000,2,447,4.397590361445783
2923263,4,B000UNYJRW,"LTR is the first film I have seen that deals with sexual incompatability in an otherwise intensely loving relationship, straight or gay.  As this is the main premise of this movie, I felt it brought a fresh and candid approach to the romantic genre.

Unfortunately, while dealing with the matter in a frank way, the resolution was never made clear.

We experienced the failed attempts, the confidences shared with a parent, and the general knowledge of the situation by their friends.

What we didn't discover was how the loving couple resolved the dilemma.

Did they decide sex wasn't important, and decide to marry and enjoy their love and companionship instead ?  Did they decide sex was important, married and sought help with their problem ?

No satisfactory answer is provided, unless you assume that marriage cures all and they lived happily ever after.

This is a brave film that tackled a real issue but delivered no real answers.  Maybe that is expecting too much from what some may feel is essentially a romantic comedy, but I feel if the writer makes this the main premise of the film he has a responsibility to provide a more real-life resolution.  Is it enough to merely raise the issue ?

I'm giving this 4 stars for the premise and congratulate the film makers for taking on a subject that has affected most adults at some time in their life (sexual incompatability).

I'm disappointed by other reviewers juvenile comments about FFN (grow up), but agree that some of the dialogue could have been a little more polished.  But, if you compare the budget that this film was probably made and the important social issues raised against a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster, you have to hand  it to them.  Almost there.",1233360000,2,1728,4.810169491525424

my rental DVD several times.
Despite being based on a comic strip, 'The mostly Unfabulous Social life of Ethan Green, from the same stable, had a pleasant realism, deftness, wit & cute cast, that 'Longterm..' sadly lacked.
 The script, stock cliched characters, acting & direction, all had the feel of a cheap & failed sitcom.
The scene where Glenn reveals to his flatmate, that his new boyfriend is a Republican - shock, horror - is labored beyond belief !

2923268,3,B000UNYJRW,"This is a movie that kept me interested throughout as it explores the relationship between two different types of men who fall in love despite their incompatibility. The two leads are likeable, and so are the actors who play their friends and family. It was refreshing to watch a film about two guys who don't sleep with each other for about a month. I wish the script had been a little sharper but I think the filmmaker has some talent.",1213833600,2,437,4.475
2923269,2,B000UNYJRW,"WOW... I have one word for this movie. Boring. Completely boring. I thought it would be good. But man was I wrong. You know not only was it boring but the actions of the characters were completely predictable. Not only that it was boring. Also the main actors are not exactly eye candy either (Thats what I think. People have different taste). Not that thats what a gay themed movie is for.  But you know you want to fall in love with that characters looks too, not just the personality. There is also a bit of nudity and a slight few seconds of love making, But that doesn't change the fact that it was boring. It was the type movie that when you watched it all you thought about was when is this crap gonna end. It had nothing fun in it. The main characters friends were the only people I actually liked (especially the stupid one), they are the reason I actually gave this movie a star.

The movie was like any other romance movie but gay. and it was boring. This movie wasn't even worth my time. And I like Naked bodies and sweet sweet romances. But not boring ones. I was totally disappointed. So unless boring predictable non-eye-candy movie where as the supporting friends are the best characters, are your thing then you'll like this movie. If not you should not waste your time with this movie.",1204502400,,1303,4.425
2923270,5,B000UNYJRW,"This is a cute movie.  I liked it from the start, despite the lead being Matthew Montgomery from Gone But Not Forgotten (I didn't like him in that).  Yes this is my favourite kind of story folks the gay love story.  And it is.  It has moments to sigh for...moments to laugh for...moments that make you go ""What the hell are you thinking doofus...""  Glenn is not having fun in the gay scene and accidentally comes across an ad his flatmate was going to answer, enter the cute southern boy Adam who seems too good to be true.  And he is because he is...(wait for it, it is scary)...a Republican.  Now as a New Zealander that means nothing to me so it is an ooookkkkkk moment. What I like in this is that for the loving couple who take time before consumating the relationship, the sex is crap.  But they perservere and continue to date and try to have good sex.  Glenn likes sex toys, Adam not so much (well at all).  So that doesn't work despite Adam 'adapting'.  What is interesting is that because Adam has to leave on Valentine's Day and Glenn doesn't get the message he sleeps with his sex-buddy - now is that likely?  I think not, but ok then, he does.  Glenn's flatmate is jealous and ruins it for them...accidentally??  But then fixes it, sort of helps really.  Anyway, happy ending - my favourite result.  As the jacket says, love conquers all...even overcoming the distraction of some supporting characters that are a pain in in the rear.  Watchable, likeable...funny, cute and gay love...it makes me smile.  Who couldn't do with a smile?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-But-Not-Forgotten/dp/B00013WVI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone, But Not Forgotten</a>",1201910400,8,1713,4.992932862190813

2923272,3,B000UNYJRW,A real nice film if you are just looking for some fun viewing. It#'s neither good literature nor a highlight of filming but fun to watch to gay men trying to build a relationship. An every day story. The caracters are nice goodlooking people and the descibtion of gay life is raely realistic. A movie for a nice evening watching tv,1199145600,,331,4.442622950819672
2923273,4,B000UNYJRW,"While not quite 5 star material.  The movie was enjoyable and featured so pretty good actors/actresses.  Loved the best friends of the main character especially his roommate.  You could tell he was hiding something for him from the start.  Also enjoyed the aspect of finding love via the personal ads.  While i've never done it personally like anything else it is possible and yes there are going to be differences and quirks that might annoy you.  But if your really into this person you learn to accept them and they do the same for you.  Thats what i got from the movie and of course it never hurts to have some full frontal going on.  It was the main reason for me liking LTR but again it didn't hurt.

Solid film and worthy of at least a rent then possible purchase on your part.",1196985600,26,784,4.388888888888889
2923274,5,B000UNYJRW,"Yes, this is a low budget movie.  But the acting and writing are well above average and the storyline is excellent.

I've been following Matthew Montgomery since Gone, But Not Forgotten and LTR is his best film yet.  I didn't say LTR was a better film then Gone, But Not Forgotten, but Montgomery's acting is much more developed in LTR.

There's a very fresh approach to gay relationships in this film.  Adam's relationship with his parents is awesome...close, open and honest, which is very rare.  The strange full frontal scene with Glenn and Adam's father is touching and doesn't end with the father making a pass at Glenn.

The thought provoking part of the film is the ending.  Instead of just ending a relationship that is nearly perfect, but still not perfect, the couple marry.  WOW.  Who would have thought?  Good old fashioned commitment saves a relationship!

The sound track is excellent as well.  Jamie Coon's Inside of Me and Erin Torpey's I Want To Be Bad are both incredible songs.",1196640000,16,997,4.760233918128655

8214054,1,B000UNYJRW,"Wow. I've seen a lot of crappy romance movies, but I've never actively rooted against the main characters getting together before. I've also never written a movie review on here before, but this was so bad, I felt that I should warn people. The whole movie, I was hoping that this terrible relationship was just the setup for whatever real relationship came next. But then it just kept going...

It was like watching a friend date someone that you know is wrong for them, but not being able to say anything about it even though you know that nothing good is going to come from it. I mean, if you like the misery of watching two people who you're pretty sure don't even LIKE each other try to delude themselves into thinking that they're happy and belong together, then by all means, this is the movie for you.",1491091200,,809,4.466216216216216
