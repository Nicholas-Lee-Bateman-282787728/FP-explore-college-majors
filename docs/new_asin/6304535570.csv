896657,3,6304535570,"This movie is hilarious, but not because it is supposed to be. It is hilariously cheesy! It actually starts great. It is intriguing, and fun in a sort of spy movie kind of way because of how the protagonist assumes different identities, looks, and accents to suit his various tasks. Only his tasks are criminal: he is a thief. His abilities as a con artist are supposed to be excellent, and although I had no idea a South African accent actually sounded more like a (not-so-great) German one, he is not too shabby at charming his subjects. Even the people he cons cannot help but admire his spunk, nerve, and sly cleverness.
Where the movie loses its way is when he meets a socially awkward, nerdy, mad scientist, a scientist who just so happens to be young, single, attractive, naive, and crazy about a guy she knows absolutely nothing about other than that he is a lying fake.
At one or two points in the movie, I thought the writer of the script had forgotten that he had already included a line previously due to its overuse. I swore if I heard, ""tell me your name"" or ""I'll find you, you found me,"" one more time, I would throw a stuffed animal at my tv.
Also, there was no real development of the protagonist's feelings to indicate what his true emotions were toward the scientist--nothing other than a few wistful smiles here and there and one moment when he talks to himself and says ""she's so great."" It was really haphazardly done and just very cheesy.
I will not say any more so as not to spoil the entire movie, but suffice it to say that had this been more of a spy-esque movie and less of a love story, it could have been great. I am someone who enjoys a good romance, but this movie should not have tried to throw one in. This movie is not a terrible way to spend two hours, but mostly the first hour is the fun part. Then it goes downhill.",1454889600,,1855,4.333333333333333

Great story and love Val Kilmer and his ability to play several very different characters in this movie!  Elizabeth Shue performs well too!  Definitely worth watching, although, I think AMAZON should offer movies over two decades old on PRIME.  There definitely should be a LARGER selection of 4 STAR Plus movies that are over a decade old on AMAZON PRIME to stream!",1452211200,8,490,4.574712643678161
896724,5,6304535570,"I have nostalgia for this movie which makes its great for me.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend it.  It's one of those off brand bond movies from the 90's. I remember that the technology looked top notch at the time; now it's just laughable.  Jack Black makes a pre-fame/rising fame appearance which was cool.  I didn't realize it was him when I saw it the first time since I had never heard of him before... Someone watching it now might not thinks its anything interesting but that was something that was cool when I revisited this movie.  Too bad they never put it on Blu-ray if that's any gauge; still, I think its a great movie and you should see it.  Action/Spy/Russia.",1451347200,,690,4.436507936507937

896888,4,6304535570,"Once again, we see Val Kilmer showing that he is a high-level and multi-dimensional actor who excels in a variety of roles. This movie was not a smash hit at the box office but it is chock full of action, adventure, romance, excitement and suspense. Kilmer highlights his talents playing numerous characters in this film, personalities and accents included. Elisabeth Shue co-stars as his romantic internet and while she's okay, I wish her character had more depth than just staring into Val's eyes longingly the whole film. (Of course, if I was in her position, I'd probably have to do the same!)

This film is based on a television series of the same name which ran from 1962-1969 and starred Roger Moore (of James Bond fame) and it was awesome to hear Roger's voice at the end.

896946,2,6304535570,"Dull attempt to create a new Saint series to compete with the Pierce Brosnan James Bond films has a weird romance novel vibe to it that seems fantastically miscalculated for an action/adventure film.  Casting Val Kilmer is about the only thing the movie gets right--he's superb, feasting on the various accents and disguises in a way Roger Moore and his narrow acting abilities could never come close to approaching on the old television show.  The Simon Templar character is such an excellent fit for Val Kilmer it's almost a crime that Paramount wasn't able to come up with a halfway decent movie around him.

The plot concerns an evil Russian oligarch who is trying to steal the secret of cold fusion from an American scientist (Elizabeth Shue, likable but largely wasted) because Russia has no heat and providing a miracle will be such a boon to his political fortunes he will be able to completely take over the country and push for his goal of a larger Russia that reclaims the satellite states of the former Soviet Union.

It's kind of amazing how dated the plot is considering that the movie is less than 20 years old.  All of the Russian oligarchs are in jail or dead and heating is about the only thing that there is no shortage of in Russia--their entire economy is built on energy production.  Even if you can ignore how far off the mark the particulars of the story are The Saint lacks any genuinely exciting action sequences and seems way too focused on Elisabeth Shue being in danger so she can be rescued by her dream man, the dashing yet emotionally vulnerable Simon Templar who is a romantic at heart--something that is made clear during the opening sequence which depicts him as a child in a Catholic orphanage.

Phillip Noyce is a talented enough director of action but the script for The Saint gives him virtually nothing to work with--the film is handsome enough but some of that production money should have been spent on a top to bottom rewrite of the script.  Some actual action sequences also would have been nice.  Elisabeth Shue's beautiful but socially awkward scientist finding true love isn't really what I was expecting or looking for--it's kind of like someone decided to make a James Bond film from the point of view of the Bond girl.",1434326400,,2268,4.692695214105793

897613,2,6304535570,"This film attempts to remake and update Leslie Charteris' character of Simon Templar (aka: The Saint.) In this modern setting, the Saint is still a criminal who hasn't gone straight and finds himself entangled in issues in post-Soviet Russia where control of energy is vital to the future and evil Communist turned evil Billionaire is planning to topple the government by obtaining the secret to cold fusion. The Saint must obtain the secret from Doctor Emma Russell (played by Elizabeth Shue).

Positives: The film does a great job with its location work, bringing to life Russia in Winter with all its cold and grittiness. Elizabeth Shue's character is pretty well-crafted, cutting against the grain of stereotypical scientists who are cold and lifeless and she's longing for something deeper and heart hungry for philosophy, truth, and beauty.

Kudos to whoever did Val Kilmer's make up. In this version, Simon Templar is a master of disguise and it seems plausible that he could pull it off with how different he looks in each disguise and Kilmer's dialects are masterful.

Negatives: We can start with spending the first six minutes of the movie gratuitously showing Simon being beaten by a stereotypically overbearing priest for refusing to accept the name chosen for him as he was left at the orphanage as a nameless orphan. Will Hollywood decide this cliche is ever overdone?

In the film's second and third acts, the best it can really manage is typical action slock which is not bad but not really good either. Plus the ending drags out through senseless decompression after the resolution.

I also have to say that the film's understanding of science is dumbfounding. The formula obtained for cold fusion is incomplete, but all our heroine needs is two hours in a room without computers or anything to wrap it up. But hey, it's an action film.

The film's biggest flaw goes back to Templar. The character just isn't likable. In fact, we rarely understand why he does anything. He wants to get $50 million in his bank account to retire...why? Why $50 million? And why does he want to quit? Is he wanting to stay out of jails? Does he not like what he does and feels on some level its wrong?  It's never explained.

Part of this is Kilmer who lacks any charm or charisma that actors like George Sanders or Roger Moore brought to the role. There's no swagger in Kilmer's Saint until the end by which point its toolater. There's no sense of fun. It's just a guy doing a job and wanting to make money.

The other thing is the way the film was written makes the character hard to like and it's the way he seduces vulnerable women and uses them for his own ends. First, it's a passenger on the plane who just found out her husband is cheating on her and then Doctor Russell, a lonely eccentric romantic longing for something deeper.  This is contrary to the original Saint films and TV shows, that while roguish, always fought on the side of angels, and left you with the impression that no innocent person had been hurt.

It would have taken magnificent performance to make such a character likable and Kilmer's mediocre performance just doesn't do it.",1402185600,,3157,4.742700729927007

Gave Kilmer a chance to play different roles within one role, and he is amusing and sexy doing so. Fun movie - fun watching Val with the different disguises, voices, accents, mannerisms.

The story is fun, too. He has to steal a formula for clean energy from a scientist (played by very pretty Elizabeth), and falls for her in the process. A Russian mobster wants formula or he will kill her, but she isn't going to let him get away with it and uses her smarts to find him, something no one else has done, in Russia, where they have to flee the mob and get the formula.",1399420800,3,697,4.403100775193798

This, to me, was the pinnacle of Val Kilmer's career; I wish they'd made additional installments as a franchise-type of film.  All of his disguises and dialects were superb; the love story between Simon Templar and Dr. Emma Russell, to this day, leaves me breathless.  I cannot stop thinking about this movie and cannot stand the critics who seem to have had it in for Val Kilmer throughout his entire career.  Mr. Kilmer is obviously brilliant and that is off-putting to those who have no talent other than to have a spot somewhere to lambaste talented performers which comes across as scathing hatred for a man who's never hurt anybody and who has spent many years giving his time and money and efforts for Native Americans and other charities.  That aside, I loved Val as Batman and he was blasted for that portrayal, too.  The Saint remains his best film in my eyes; it remains as fresh today as when I'd originally viewed it in the theatre.

897932,5,6304535570,"The first half is quality high tech International espionage with degrees of engaging characterization. It's solid, fun, kinetic, and a blast.  The best part is how dated everything is. Flip cell phones straight from 1997, and you've got the ill-fated electronica score of the mid-90s guiding you through Kilmer's cleft chin exploits.

The second half is where it stumbles. Originally, the director wanted a wicked awesome sword fight climax that required Emma to die early on in the film. Test audiences being test audiences abhorred the downer, and requested a happy, stupid ending (hence why there's three, or four false flag codas a la Lifetime movies.) It breaks my heart what the studios did to the end. Emma should've been killed off to propel Kilmer's character further. It would've made the last narration by Roger Moore, and Templar's contribution of the cold fusion formula much more potent. Instead, we get a dopey ending.

So what you have is the strangest chick flick of all-time. It's an action-adventure chick flick buoyed by Val Kilmer's charisma, and bad Russian accents. The movie is solid, and one of my favorites for what it is. Five stars. Six when we get the Director's Cut.",1366243200,,1196,4.97

898007,4,6304535570,"This movie shares a cinematic heritage with many other movies about international intrigue and characters who are masters of disguise or espionage. This one is interesting because it comes from a unique time when there were a lot of changes going on in the world. The setting is in post-communist Russia and involves energy tycoons engaging in shady behavior. There is also a story line involving cold fusion that can only be viewed as somewhat silly in retrospect. In any case, the setting and details are not necessarily all that important for a movie like this. The main character, played by Val Kilmer, is an orphan who has mastered the art of disguises and trickery and works as a sort of freelance espionage specialist. His eventual romantic interest and side kick is played by Elizabeth Shue who is as charming as ever, albeit completely unbelievable as a renown scientist. Kilmer and Shue seem to develop some chemistry in the film and Kilmer turns in another unique and engaging performance. The action sequences are just low-key enough to be somewhat different than many of these types of movies but still fast-paced enough keep the viewer interested. There is something about this movie that makes it memorable. Perhaps it is the fact that the main character is more of a one-man-show and his main supporting cast is not a team of gadget-laden colleagues, but a helpless woman who becomes a love interest. In any case, even though the setting and scientific premise seems a bit quaint and dated, the movie still delivers.",1352505600,3,1532,4.8961538461538465

898009,3,6304535570,"My ex-girlfriend was in love with Val Kilmer.  She was his Brad Pitt.  We watched like every Kilmer movie together, and her favorite was `The Saint'.  I probably saw this movie fifty times in the two years that we dated; seriously.  Now, this was YEARS ago (god, I feel old now) and so I wasn't even half the cinephile I am today.  My taste in film generally consisted of explosions, sex and fight scenes and so I was more than fine with watching `The Saint', since it has all three to a degree.  A few months ago I happened to catch this film on television and it brought back memories of my teenage years and `the one that got away' (we're both married with children now and keep in touch, albeit sparsely).

I have never seen the original television series, and I never read any of the novels, so my opinion is based solely on my feelings on the film itself.  Watching it now and pulling it from the context of `yesteryear memories' was a different experience.  The 90's were a big time for spy films and `The Saint' was then and is still considered one of the shallower attempts at the genre.

I blame a lot of that on Kilmer.

I am personally a fan of his work.  I used to really like him as an actor, but even now in my newfound view of film I see greatness in a lot of his work, namely his 90's turns.  He should have been up for an Oscar for his flawless performance in `The Doors', which was just uncanny and still haunts.  He has a great knack for comedic timing, as he's shown as recent as 2005's `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.  It's sad to me that his star persona has diminished and he's basically become a washed up joke of an actor.  His performance here is too calculated for its own good.  He just cannot get the persona of a spy down without feeling, well, like a guy trying to pretend to be a spy.  I understand that the character of Simon Templar is far different than that of James Bond, and so you can't expect the same suaveness about them, but Kilmer just can't convey anything outside of cold calculation.

You have to suspend disbelief with a film like this because rarely do spy movies remain logical throughout.  With the amount of `cool gadgets' and `improbably action sequences', this genre is corroded with aspects that can be deemed `stupid' by the literal mind.  I have no problem suspending disbelief and even forgiving preposterousness if it is handled in a way that makes me wish that it were possible.  `The Saint' never gets there though.  It doesn't grab me by the shirt collar and thrust me into perpetual daydreaming.  It just kind of made me shrug.  Shue is also a disappointment, but she is like the epitome of a one hit wonder (looking at her string of mediocrity, it still baffles me that she delivered something as sincere and moving as her performance in `Leaving Las Vegas').

In the end, this is a film that I remember fondly and maybe that is why I forgive it for disappointing me recently.  It isn't that great of a movie (although the soundtrack is KILLER) but I still like it for reasons not entirely related to the movie itself.",1340064000,2,3075,4.386925795053004

Unfortunately, I didn't have the same viewing experience; I found this movie enormously disappointing.  It probably didn't help that I am not a fan of Val Kilmer (and subsequently found his performance hammy at best, self-indulgent at worst).  None of his so-called disguises hid who he was thus making them null (he actually had it written into the plot: the more the merrier).  It's not surprising to learn that many actors turned down this role (even Arnold Schwarzenegger!).  The plot was preposterously pseudo-sci-fi junk; a one joke concept.  It wasn't even really a ""Saint"" movie, just some guy who happened to use the same name.  There was one too many endings (again, no surprise as the ""real"" ending did not test well with audiences so they had to make a quick change).  As for the miraculous recovery of Elisabeth Shue's character...the oft mentioned heart problem simply went away!  What was the point in giving her a debilitating ailment only to later ignore it because it proved inconvenient to the story (in the first version of the film her character dies)?

This movie is a keeper, I am going to put it in my collection of favorite movies.

I really like the scenery and the neat gadgets that Kilmer's character, Simon Templar, had. The love story between the characters is what grabbed my attention from the beginning of the movie. The way that Kilmer's character could change his appearance, and his accents was interesting too. The dialogue was good, and there was also a good balance of suspense and romance in the movie.

His acting was great. Val Kilmar once again proves that he is one of the most multi-dimensional actors of our time. Just think of all the different types of roles that he's played in movies over the years. In The Saint, he gets to assume even more roles with his constant disguise changes and varying voice inflections. Elizabeth Shue was great as well. For many reasons, I believe that The Saint is one of the best movies of our time.

898187,4,6304535570,"I saw this at the theatres when it came out and was enthralled by it. I saw it multiple times, although that was partially because I was studying in Jordan at the time and in Jordan I would watch American movies just to get a break from my Arabic immersion program (I think I watched more movies that year than I have in the last ten). Nevertheless, the fact that I was abroad made the international setting of it seem more exiting. At that time I had never been to Russia.

I think I watched it once on tape after that, after having lived in Russia (in 1999), and I realized then how much Russians would hate this movie. I've now just recently watched it again for the first time in probably eight years, and of course I've spent a lot of time developing my thinking on international affairs during that span.

Now watch this again to see what was wrong with how Americans viewed Russia in the 1990s. Like Sean Connery's ""The Rising Sun"" on Japan in the early 1990s, this movie reflects how Americans viewed Russia during that time. Not that it was necessarily inaccurate. The speech given by the character of Ivan Tretiak certainly captures how many Russians feel. And Russia did have a kind of hapless reformist president at that time.

The key is the closing scenes in which an American has to tell the hapless Russian president what he should do, and then when another American works some magic behind the scenses, Russians enthusiastically fall for him. This is precisely how the U.S. foreign policy establishment treated Russia during that time. Why it was not clear that Russians would resent this, I don't know.

As far as the movie itself is concerned, I still enjoy the build-up even though the ending is dumb. And I think this is the only movie Val Kilmer ever successfully carried. He has been in other great movies (Heat, Ghost in the Darkness), but he's never led another that I'd consider watching twice.

You know what they say about curiosity...

Val Kilmer gives us a two-dimensional sociopath whose squinty-eyed attempts at acting leave one wishing the authorities would see through his flimsy ""disguises"" and lock him away to spare us the rest of this movie. The romance is cheesy, the ""haunting past"" borders on the absurd, the ""evil Russian Mafia conspiracy"" is painfully stereotypical, the script sounds like a bargain-bin reject, the plot holes are big enough to drive a truck through, the action sequences are the interminable ""everyone is a superhero"" variety that has become so pervasive - and at a 112-minute running time, it all plays out at excruciating length. The film could almost work as satire if it didn't take itself with such stilted seriousness.

Together, Kilmer and Shue sizzle.  Their kisses are hot and passionate.  There is plenty of suspense and intrigue as they are pursued by Russian henchmen.  Beautiful London and Moscow scenery and a rocking soundtrack enhance the chases.

  Val Kilmer delivers his best performance as the Saint and proves that he can hold a movie on his own.  I was quite impressed with his ability to disguise his appearance and voice and pretend to be so many diverse personalities.

898291,4,6304535570,"I first saw this movie in the theater in '97 and though I soon forgot the plot, I came away with a general sense of having enjoyed the film. So I grabbed the DVD when it was on sale for $5 and just watched it again. Now I remember why I enjoyed it so much the first time.

What I really liked:

1) The two lead characters are multi-dimensional.

Simon is nuanced, a bad guy with a code of ethics. I know, nothing new there. But in Simon's case, he seems unaware of his own ethics, only discovering he has them when he comes into contact with someone else whose moral code is so powerful (Dr. Russell). I love the moment when he starts to see the moral implications of what he's about to do---steal from someone he respects---and realizes he can't do it. A moment of redemption, all too quickly followed by another ethical quandary: he is forced to steal her formula anyway in order to protect her.

Dr. Emma Russell so closely resembles the many super intelligent people I've known that she resonates as genuine. Yes, it's very likely that a genius would have palpitations when faced with public speaking. Yes, it's also extremely likely that a genius would be socially awkward, shy, and suffer a lack of social self confidence. In addition, Ms. Shue portrays Dr. Russell with a bit of clumsiness, and sweet innocence and enthusiasm, making her an approachable and likeable heroine.

2) Dr. Russell's heart condition---as near as I can figure without it having been explicitly named---is accurately portrayed. Her symptoms and the need for a pill at specific times does match an actual rhythm disturbance (I have a relative with the same condition). As a discriminating viewer, I find little details like this a thrill, because so many Hollywood movies get sloppy.

3) The movie manages to tell it's story without unnecessary cursing, bloodshed and explicit sex. Sex is even part of the romance, but in a touching, understated way. I'm not against the use of these elements when they're germane to the story (as is the violence, for example, in Saving Private Ryan). However, many modern movies indulge too much in sex, violence and profanity just for audience titillation, or because it's thought to be expected. This film does it all tastefully, placing the violence and sex in the context of the story, and not the other way around.

4) Mr. Kilmer seems to relish playing such a diverse array of characters. I found his accents to be quite realistic and his adoption of each persona was fascinating. Watch his body language--it's distinctly different with each new 'identity.' That's what is called 'character acting,' and I think it's a true mark of talent when an actor can pull it off.

5) It's pure, escapist fantasy fun. You're not supposed to take this movie seriously. This was never meant to win an Academy Award. It's just a popcorn movie, but one with refreshingly rich characters and incredible backdrops in the capitals of Europe.

What I don't like about this movie is mostly nit-picky, but I'll throw it out there:

1) The science of cold fusion is ridiculous. The writers would have done better to not attempt to explain it, as anyone with an ounce of understanding will quickly see through Dr. Russell's 'explanation' at the start of the film. Despite this flaw, I do still greatly enjoy the story and I can still suspend belief enough to go along for the ride. I just wish they'd have treated this with as much care as the heart condition.

2) Speaking of the heart condition, it plays a major part through the first 2/3rds of the film, then abruptly disappears. A miracle cure?

3) Given that the main characters are well-drawn and believable, it's a bit bewildering that Dr. Russell so quickly forgives Simon for his betrayal. After one quick scene where she justifiably rebukes him, she then rather happily trots off with him and all is forgiven.

4) There are two 'false' endings. Just when you think you've reached the end ... you haven't. It goes on. And then on some more. I suppose this was the result of an inability of the writers to figure out how to get where they wanted to go.

As for the DVD itself, I wish there were more special features, at least some deleted scenes. Maybe for the Director's Cut version?",1147651200,12,4243,4.685483870967742

  This film is pretty enjoyable, and has a nice basis that it goes from.  For instance, Kilmer's character does not just change his name because he has too, but because of the anonyminity with which he has lived his whole life.  Thus we are intrigued, and as his character humorously goes from disguise to disguise to escape ""them"" all, we just cannot help but get a little caught up.

  As one reviewer mentioned, Kilmer fans should enjoy his different ""selves"", or saints of the moment if you will.  Yet, this film is actually just good-natured, and a bit dramatic (action) at times too.

Some detractors accuse this Saint of being unrealistic and ""corny"", but fans of The Saint who dislike fictional escapism and ""corny"" entertainment should really find a new hero. There has always been a great deal of escapism and ""corn"" in The Saint canon, films, radio shows, comics, and TV shows. This Saint is certainly no worse, and in many ways is far superior, to other later day Saints like Ian Ogilvy or Simon Dutton. They each had their strong points, but Val Kilmer's Templar is by far a more intriguing character. I have very little knowledge of Val Kilmer's other work, but he's engaging and entertaining in this role. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that the origin of the character is revealed for the first time. Some have said this only takes place at the start of the film, but in reality the entire film IS the origin. It includes Simon's journey from criminal to Saint. His transformation, and three ""miracles"", kept me hooked from start to finish.  All Simon Templar fans should give this one another look.

898325,1,6304535570,"IF YOU A FAN OF THE SAINT (EITHER THE BOOKS OR THE ROGER MOORE TV SERIES) DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!
The only saving grace for this movie is that it starts by exploring The Saint's childhood as the source of his behaviour as an adult - something that was never done in the books or the TV series. Unfortunately, having piqued your interest, from then on it's downhill all the way. That is compounded by a corny script, Kilmer's stodgy acting, and really bad disguises. Only a Kilmer fan could love this movie. It's not even good enough for ""Bad Movie Night"".
The really sad thing is that the movie rights to ""The Saint"" are probably still tied-up with someone who is not capable of producing a good Saint movie. Although I'm not a fan of the current Batman movies, it would be good to follow their example of bringing out the dark side of the character. The Saint is basically a thief. Even when he does get the stolen goods back from the bad guys he does extract his payment, either by taking a commission or by robbing the bad guys (and where do bad guys get their money from?). He is also ruthless - as he has to be because he inhabits a dangerous world. These are sides of the character that for obvious reasons, ATV couldn't bring to the TV version. It would also be interesting to put him in his early context of 1929-1945 but without the corny tosh that Hollywood would make of it.",1110326400,4,1389,4.346153846153846

It's a romance, people.  That may not be what the director/scripters originally intended, but that's the way it ended up.  A wonderful, stirring romantic origin-story that asks and answers the questions, ""Why would someone become a professional thief?"", and ""Why would he change radically to become a ""Saint"", using his former talents for good?""

The answer, of coure, being love of a good woman.  Snicker if you must, but I still believe this can and does happen -- just with less sexy-looking people than Val Kilmer.

Elizabeth Shue plays the naive physics researcher and does it well.  Some critics felt it was ridiculous that she was presented as a genius but couldn't make a public presentation without having heart palpitations.  Actually that's 100% possible, I've seen enough brilliant engineers totally fall apart at management reviews.

Having disposed of these objections, I will say that Val's acting skills made the movie.  Watching his body language change with his accents and hairstyles was amazing.  There is a scene where he actually ""morphs"", instant by instant, in voice and expression from his thief persona to ""Thomas More,"" the poet/artist/traveler who will steal Dr. Emma's heart.  Amazing.

His inner conflict was masterfully portrayed for those who notice subtlety.  He knows he can fool Emma - he HAS fooled her, completely - but then, is he ""pretending"" to fall in love with her or is it real?  What is real?  His self-doubts, his sudden perception of his inner emotional poverty, his impulsive decision to not steal Emma's cold-fusion notes because ""Ahhh, I can't DO this... she's so great.""

The films borders on moronic and juvenile and never attempts to reach higher.  Elizabeth Shue as a fusion scientist provides some comic relief but not nearly enough.  Val Kilmer delves into the Saint as though he is trying to fulfill a contract and ensure there will be no sequels.

The script borrows from the best of the bargain bin.  There are no attempts to bring intrigue or even concern to the screen as these characters wander aimlessly from one scene to the next.

I cannot even express my distaste for the finale where Elizabeth Shue delivers an important scientific briefing while Val hams it up in the audience.  This scene alone sums up everything wrong in modern film.

I know that this will lie among glowing reviews of this same film on Amazon's website.  My only advice is if you find movies like ""Independance Day"", ""Matthew Broderick's Godzilla"", and ""Steven Seagal's Fire Down Below"" (I put some names before the titles because I believe actors should be held accoutable), then you'll love this fun-filled romp through European espionage.",1097366400,9,1259,4.841121495327103

I was very pleased wwith this film and the Saint is one of my favorite characters of all time. There are a few changes here, but most of them work very well within the prequel context. This is the first movie to eplain how a young Simon Templar began his exploits as a master criminal and became a force for justice. I loved the master of disguise angle of the movie. It's far more extreme in the movie than it ever was in the Saint books, but I'm okay with that. I've never recovered from the literary Saint dressing as a nun! LOL! Good old Simon! The Saint has been a source of entertainment for me for years and this film is no exception. It has a great cast and a adventurous vibe that captures the spirit of my favorite Saint adventures. I am more than a little surprised by the complaints on here about the romantic elements of the movie. The Saint stories were always larger than life. Good does not always triumph over evil in the real world, but that never stopped the Saint. What's wrong with a bigger than life romantic adventure? Why must Simon Templar be an asexual being? He has a heart and should have feelings of love like the rest of us. Those who have a problem with romance may not enjoy this movie, but those who like romantic adventures should give this a try. I like a good adventure/love story and this movie is a delightful one. I also don't understand how reviewers can call this movie ""trash"" and then give it 3 stars! LOL!

Although Val Kilmer plays his own version of the character with a lot of impersonations, the movie overall falls flat with a ridiciulous romantic sub-plot involving a cute scientist (Elisabeth Shue.) As if the movie script was written by a pubescent girl dreaming what it would be like to live in such a fantasy world of espionage. The plot was just too absurd and far-fetched to be credible and was too immersed into an idiotic romance which should have never been.

The characters were 2-dimensional cliches that are typical hollywood junk cranked out on the screen year after year.
The Saint was a suave debonaire who helped women in distress but was far too mature of a man reduce himself to the idiotic da-da, all over you, puppy-love romance shown in the film. Such a scenario is one that only immature little girls fantasize about before coming of age. It therefore immediately apparent that the script was written for a teen female audience that would drool over Kilmer and dish out their dollars to indulge in their naive erotic fantasies.

Although I am a very big fan of Val Kilmer's work and own many of his movies, I haven't bothered even renting this piece of trash. I'd rather spend my money and buy the original Roger Moore mini-series instead.",1091491200,,1416,4.871369294605809

Whenever it starts to drag Kilmer turns up in a new disguise and that alone carries the film through to its next thrill. Not to mention that the chemistry between Shue and Kilmer is hot enough to sizzle a steak.

898458,5,6304535570,"I really liked this film, and yes, I have seen the series with Roger Moore.  I note that the reviews here so far seem to fall into two camps: people who never saw the series, and loved the film, and people who loved the series, and just can't get over their disappointment that their beloved character wasn't faithfully portrayed on the big screen.
No, Val Kilmer's Simon Templar is not the same as Roger Moore's. but this isn't really such a bad thing.  The movie is a really nice, underrated spy thriller.  It's got action, romance, exotic locals, love-to-hate-em villains, a likeable hero, and a plot that doesn't strain suspension of disbelief too far.  What more do you want in a popcorn movie?
I'll admit, if you're a real fan of the series or the books it might have been nice to have a movie that reflects the original a little more faithfully.  But it might be well to recognize that the series was not without its faults as well.  For one thing, it always bothered my about the series that Simon Templar is an unadulterated good guy, who never, ever does anything really criminal or base or rotten, yet everywhere he goes, the local authorities are watching him like hawks, as though he is some kind of arch criminal.
I'm also rather thrown for a loop that some of the reviewers here blast the movie for being unbelievable, and then decry Val Kilmer's Simon Templar because he's not like the ""real"" Saint.  True, this version is not all that faithful to the spirit of Leslie Charteris' character, but that Saint was a freelance, adventuring do-gooder, a man who read the papers eager to find a cause to involve himself in.  His moral code was strong, and his motives were also pure: he would never hurt, steal from, or kill anyone who doesn't completely deserve it. In short, the Saint was the Robin Hood of the twentieth century.  Folks, let's face it, this is not the most believable character in fiction.  I grant you, it's certainly fun, and it might have played well in the pulp era of the 1920s in which the character orignated (or even the early to mid 60s when the series was made), but the producers of the film probably felt (and perhaps not wrongly, let's grant) that this sort of thing was just too much for audiences to swallow in today's more cynical era.
If you can get over the fact that this is not really Leslie Charteris' Saint, then you will find this movie to be a really fun, entertaining spy thriller.  I recommend it.",1060387200,76,2451,4.535147392290249

898514,4,6304535570,"""The Saint"" is an action and romance packed movie, featuring veteran actors Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue. ""The Saint"" was originally a television series in the 1960's featuring Roger Moore as the Saint. But as most cases are, this 1997 new movie version of the character of the Saint is only remotely close to the original. And again as most cases are, it isn't really such a bad thing. My suggestion is that if you have seen the original series and you are about to watch this movie, keep an open mind in that the character and the feel of Simon Templar is a bit different.
Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, the man of many faces and names. Though none other than a mercenary spy and a thief, he is always in the right as he thwarts enemies while giving British authorities a merry chase. The country of Russia is in chaos as there is a severe oil shortage. The people are rising in a revolution, the leader being Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) who is in actuality cheating and lying to all his 'fellow countrymen'. In fact he and his son, Ilya (Valeri Nikolayev) are your average power-hungry bad guys, in fact the ones who started a fake oil shortage! Their plan is to steal Dr. Emma Russell's (Elisabeth Shue) fusion power theory with the help of Simon Templar, thus getting more support from the people of Russia. But as Simon falls in love with the beautiful doctor (and she with him), he changes plans and helps her escape the Tretiak's while saving the Russian people dying from the cold.
Val Kilmer does a marvelous job in his character, all of his disguises and fake accents completely well-done. His many disguises change from a long-haired artist, a peppered gray mustache for a Russian, thinning hair and dorky face and glasses for a reporter, and more. His accents are the most well-done and range from a thick Russian accent, bright Australian accent, soft South African accent, and more! And Elizabeth Shue for me has certainly grown up, since I've only seen her as a teenager in ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Adventures in Babysitting"". Her acting is pretty good but I didn't really like her that much as I like most other heroines in other movies.
The story line is averagely good, and as some people have mentioned, at times the movie was a bit tedious and long-drawn. In my opinion, I think they could have cut out more of the romantic scenes and included more espionage, action, escapes, fights... you get the idea. I just felt that just when it was getting exciting, it was either suddenly cut short or the suspense was taken out. What action there was though was fantastic! Very exciting, the best scenes include the Saint stealing a microchip in the beginning and all the escapes from Tretiak's henchmen.
I feel that all action movies should always have a bit of humor instilled and ""The Saint"" does have its funny moments. I love the part in the beginning where Simon is just about to break into a building, discovers that the door isn't locked then remarks, ""I love this country!"" The ending is pretty funny also as he has a run in with some inspectors from Scotland Yard. Simon Templar's car horn is pretty cool!
Put it all together, ""The Saint"" is pretty fantastic if you have a free 2 hours to spare. As I said, if you've been a fan of ""The Saint"" and you're about to watch this movie, keep an open mind if you hope to enjoy it! The PG-13 rating is for adult situations and the action.
A bit of trivia: In the end of the movie, Simon turns on the radio and listens to an announcer. I wasn't sure but I was able to confirm that the radio announcer's voice is none other than Roger Moore, the man who played The Saint in the television series!",1030060800,17,3661,4.515060240963855

He deceives her, she tracks him down, there's a lot of chases, and oh yeah, there's a revolution going on around them. The fun part: The thief is noble at heart, a master of quick-changes and impersonations, and always picks for his personae the names of Catholic saints (a rather telling calling-card, if you ask me, but the movie asks us to ""forget"" that any criminal profiler would catch that within 30 seconds).
It's a romp of a movie. There's definite chemistry between Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue, the leads, and it's delightful to see Kilmer's various personae, how different they all really are. The movie drags a bit in the middle (and honestly, the entire beginning sequence could have been left out safely), but it picks up again. There are some fascinating characters in here, most particularly the greedy ""art dealer"" Frankie, who steals every scene she's in. Unfortunately, the bad guys aren't among the fascinating -- both are two-dimensional and stereotypical. But there's plenty to compensate for the movie's shortcomings. A chase scene involving Shue trying to reach the American embassy is among my favorites in movie history. The sets are very cool. The acting is fairly solid, bad guys aside.

A somewhat intelligent plot and some above average acting make this one of those rare films that's actually worth watching.  The plot is too easy to give away, and I don't want to be one of those people who wrecks the ending, so I'll just say one more thing.

A couple of weeks ago I finally watched The Saint with Val Kilmer.  The reason I wasn't too crazy about the movie was the fact that Kilmer's character resembled nothing of the Roger Moore character.  Roger Moore was debanoir, suave and knew what he was doing.  Kilmer was sometimes not believable and was also in different disguises.  The Roger Moore character was never in disguise and to the best of my knowledge, the George Sanders character was not also. However, I give the movie credit for establishing a plot that gets a little outrageous.  Fair movie, but watch the Roger Moore show if you like the Simon Templar character.",994636800,4,796,4.8088235294117645
898589,4,6304535570,"Having never seen the original Saint series with Roger Moore or other depictions of the character, I cannot comment on how closely Val Kilmer's portrayal of the Saint is to the original.  But as a stand-alone spy movie, the Saint is excellent.  Kilmer has a very different look as a spy and Simon Templar's character throughout the movie is very interesting.  He is cold at times and yet unbelievably warm.  Throw the very attractive and sensitive Elizabeth Shue into the mix and you have a great romance brewing.  But actors interact wonderfully together as the story moves along.
The plot's focus on scandal involving corrupt Russian tycoons is a great look at a possibly near-future situation and the current instability that already affects Eastern Europe.  With some comidy, action, and suspense thrown in, the viewers are left with a very satisfying and enjoyable movie.
This movie is one of my personal favorites, a lot due to Kilmer and Shue's characters, and also due to the plot twists and turns.  The Saint has the right amounts of every ingredient to make it a winner.",991612800,4,1080,4.868852459016393

It has romance, clever humour, a good plot (fantasy that it is) and well-defined characters. There is no harsh violence, bad language or torrid sex scenes. The Saint and Dr Emma Russel's love was so powerful - it was very moving. But make no mistake - this is no soppy love romance movie. The action and humour kept it moving at a fast pace.
I doubt if it was intended to be an exact remake of the original and it may disappoint those who expect it to be such. But for the rest of you, sit back and enjoy!!",990921600,2,642,4.103174603174603

The film doesn't really follow the storyline of the books or the series, with Roger Moore.  If you are nostalgic about the series then this probably isn't the best film for you.  The film itself is a blend of action, romance and comedy at times.  The stars of the film; Val Kilmer (Heat) and Elizabeth Shue (Hollow Man), have a genuinely believable romance that leaves any Val Kilmer fan wishing that they were Elizabeth!  As for the Russians in the film; they add a refreshing edge which reminds us of how corrupt the World can be.  The film follows the life of a thief who's only aim is to make $50 million, any way he can, and he uses the names of Catholic Saints to hide his trail.  Meanwhile in a small corner of the World, Dr. Emma Russel has just discovered a scientific Phenomenon.  The Russians want her discovery and they are willing to pay whatever and kill whoever it takes to get hold of it.  The Saint then gets caught up in a web of Russian Maffia, intigue and love.

However, in regard to the modern day Robin Hood character created by authour Leslie Charteris (who is not mentioned ANYWHERE in the credits AT ALL.....) in the late 1920's, the only ""Saintly"" tie-ins are: Roger Moore's voice-over at the end of the film (the original TV Saint), A Volvo coupe (although not white), the trademark stickman pin, and Orbital's update of the Saint Theme.  Everything else, right down to The Saint's origins, have little to do with the character.  I did like the movie, but after reading so many of the stories, I prefer the RKO films of the 30's / 40's and the TV series with Roger Moore (re-issued on DVD and VHS) as a closer comparison to The Saint character.

The Saint himself isn't quite the character of the criminally out-of print Leslie Charteris novels, but is suitably updated and polished for the 1990s. The film is best considered as an ""origins"" film in the vogue of Tim Burton's ""Batman"" trying to introduce a new audience to the Saint.
Oddly, Mr Charteris does not rate a mention by the films titles.
Plot wise the story hangs together with more coherence that the two ""Mission: Impossible"" movies and Val Kilmer does creditable service as Templar(especially in his various guises). The disguises are a bit more believable and the gadgets are employed in a creative, yet functionally manner. You do believe that the stuff does what is depicted.
The romance angle is tender, but never maudlin or cloying. It adds to the overall enjoyment. It does not make this film a ""chick-flick"".

Although the Simon Templar we see in the film isn't the one we've come to recognise through the literature and other movies, he is still a very likeable character in his own right.
A master of disguise, thief and all round ladies man, Simon Templar takes a job to steal the formula for cold fusion from a  professor so that he can retire on the money that he'll make from the job.
All goes well until he meets the professor and finds her to be a young beautiful woman.  He falls for her and decides not to steal the formula from her but the person who hired him threatens to kill her if he doesn't complete the job as planned.
So, he takes the formula and from then on he does his best to keep one jump ahead of everyone using high tech equipment and pure good luck as well as trying to stop the cold fusion formula getting into the wrong hands.
Does he get the girl?  The ending will not disappoint.
There are three steps to becoming a saint - he may falter along the way but eventually he takes them.  Great piece of evening's entertainment after a hard at work when you just want relax.",976838400,2,1257,4.2426778242677825

As Russian I have to admit I was annoyed about the fact that Russia was pictured so one-dimensionally. It portrayed as an awful place populated by murderers and money-grabbing morons. But the mercenary spy named Simon Templar saved the place. The Saint is driven by pure monetary reasons, but also by crusading spirit (one of the first scenes shows him as a boy reading a book about Knights Templar). Just passing by he manages to liberate the people of Russia from the grip of the monstrous, crazy and power-craving oil magnate. On the way he meets one very nice girl and falls in love. The movie is so bad that it is kind of a satire on itself. At places it reminds me the moronic anti-American propaganda of the Soviet times but in reverse. If you want to see a movie with real suspense, well-developed characters and real Russia you should get ""The Russia House"".

Simon Templar, ""The Saint,"" was one of the latter. There never was much to Templar to begin with; he was just a debonair smart aleck in the tradition of Philo Vance and Bulldog Drummond. But surely even a fourth-rate cardboard character deserves more than this: being turned into a vehicle for Val Kilmer's apparently limitless self-indulgence. The film is actually a Kilmer anthology - donning about a dozen so-called disguises, he never gets around to acting the part of Templar, but he does run through all the trademark Val characters (smoldering lounge lizard, buck-toothed comic, stoic tough guy). We're supposed to care because he doesn't know how to be HIMSELF, but in fact we're grateful for small favors. The movie is also memorable for a second awful performance -- by Elisabeth Shue, who appears visibly frustrated and puzzled over how to play scenes with her bizarre co-star.",973036800,4,1040,5.087719298245614

This is what good spy movies should be like.  Granted Templar is a thief, but that's a technicallity in this movie.  Arguably the best thief in the world is working his way towards retirement  when he gets caught up in a plot, led by a Russian oil tychoon names  Tretiak, to take over the USSR.
Shue plays Doctor Russell who is working  on the formula for cold fusion that Templar is tasked to steal. She becomes  a partner of sorts to Templar in a quest to thwart the plans of  Tretiak.
Every aspect of The Saint comes together to make it a modern day  classic that can challenge the likes of Goldeneye and other great spy  movies.
Not only an action film, The Saint has the nice subplot of a love  story between Templar and Dr. Russell, that plays a larger role in the  ladder half of the movie as the two characters fall for each other.
Why  this movie didn't break out as a hit I think I may never know. At least you  now have the change to make up for what you missed in the theaters. Enjoy a  sleeper hit movie with The Saint.",967161600,20,1279,4.138211382113822

898651,5,6304535570,"For some reason, The Saint was not the hugest hit at the box office. After buying the video and watching it many times, I wonder why.
The acting was great. Val Kilmar once again proves that he is one of the most  multi-dimensional actors of our time. Just think of all the different TYPES  of roles that he's played in movies over the years. In The Saint, he gets  to assume even more roles with his constant disguise changes and varying  voice inflections. Elizabeth Shue was great as well. Her character was both  smart and a little out of it, and I guess if I were designing a genius  character for a movie, it would be like that: smart in their field, but a  little out of touch with the world. The bad guys also did a great job.
The story is fun and exciting, a little unbelievable, but hey, that's  why we go see movies, right? There's gadgets, humor, suspense,  romance...it's all here. The Saint had all the makings of a classic.
Fans  of the TV series will get a kick out of Roger Moore being the radio voice  at the end. I feel that overall the makers of the movie did an admirable  job of taking the Saint story and fitting it into the 1990's while staying  true to the original idea.

There's plenty of action. Gunfire, explosions, car chases,  chases on foot . . . You won't be bored watching the movie.
A master of  disguise. Val Kilmer seems to be having the time of his life as Simon goes  from womanizing hippie to nerdy reporter to tortured artist, all in the  name of his work.
A great villain. Rade Serbedzija is always a delight,  as he appeared in MIGHTY JOE YOUNG and EYES WIDE SHUT, but his role here is  his best to date. You almost want to root for him.

Val Kilmer.
Vilmer, an outstanding actor, is letter  perfect in the role as the title character. Effortlessly Vilmer's character  changes accents, appearances and personas to steal and swindle and,  ultimately, redeem himself.

I didn't find it hard to follow at  all and I'm only 16, I know it was compared to Mission impossible (people  saying that was easier to follow) and I totallt still don't get Mission  impossible.

Elisabeth Shue's character makes your heart ache: someone so beautiful to  be so alone and in search for the magic of love. The chemistry between  Kilmer and Shue is absolutely overwhelming, and it makes me wonder why I  have read so many critic reviews on this movie that have shot it to the  dirt? Why listen to critics anyway? What exactly do they expect? This is a  movie where you have to see the beauty and the fun that it displays, and  understand the purity and magnificence of true, spirited love. Critics can  dog this movie all they want, where it's action may not excite the  ""Armageddon"" fans, and it's suspense may not grip the  ""Scream"" fans, the excellence of this movie is left for those who  can relate to it. In this world that lacks magic, is filled with  disappointments, and sad, repeititive activities, this movie is the spice  that anyone's life can use. Yes, critics, shake your heads in disgust, just  know that The Saint's love story alone by far trascends the over-rated  greatness of ""Titanic"" and other such movies that everyone went  mad over.

There's even a sub-plot about the need for a  clean energy source.
So obviously with all those elements there's  something in here to appeal to everyone. That's not to say the movie's  perfect. Look elsewhere if you want a serious drama, or oscar caliber  performances. But honestly the film succeeds on all counts to be  entertaining and engrossing.
The DVD version doesn't have a lot of  extras; only audio commentary and the trailer. However the picture quality  is amazing. This is probably the sharpest and brightest DVD I have in my  collection. The sound quality is also excellent.
