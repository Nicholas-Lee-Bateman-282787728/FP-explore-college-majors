8264382,5,B00170HV04,"We often equate mobile warfare with WW II, but the reality is that house to house fighting had a major impact on many campaigns.  Stalingrad turned the tide in Russia and Bastogne was the stumbling block for the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge.

But it wasn't just the Germans who had problems in urban fighting.  It stalled the Allied advance in Italy and took a horrible toll on American units entering Germany (Aachen is an example).  And, although they prevailed, the Soviets took terrible loses in the final Battle of Berlin.

This late war film took the lessons of this fighting and applied to the upcoming invasion of Japan.  Fortunately, they didn't need it thanks to the A-Bomb.

The second film is a 1943 British film on the same subject that was also used by the US Army.  It probably was the film that American soldiers saw before D-Day.

This is a good DVD for those who want to know more about this important aspect of WW II tactics.",1314576000,,950,4.508771929824562
