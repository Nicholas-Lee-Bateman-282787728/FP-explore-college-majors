7982665,2,B00008G5ZV,"This was a flawed disc. In the Schumann Rhenish symphony, four of the five movements either had a skip or a temporary freeze.  But that isn't all: the conductor's movements seemed very ""herky-jerky.""  I found out why in the Wagner pieces that followed: the synchronization between audio and video was off by about a beat (most revealing in the opening of Siegfried's Funeral March).  I do not know whether this is common to all the DVDs of this concert or only one batch. In reading reviews of other Waldbuehne concerts I ran across another reviewer who mentioned a lack of synchronization, so maybe it's just a batch problem.  Otherwise, the music is wonderful, the crowd appreciative of the works of two titans of German music.",1518566400,,729,4.808

7982667,4,B00008G5ZV,"The only reason this didn't get five stars is due to the less-than-stellar sound.  The orchestra is, of course, amazing - particularly considering much of the concert was performed during a pretty good rain storm (several times I could hear the rain while the orchestra was playing).  Gustavo Dudamel is an amazing conductor, and conducted this concert entirely without a score; yet I never got the feeling he didn't know exactly where the music was going at any time - or that it was not properly rehearsed.  The problem is that as good as this concert was, it was recorded out of doors, and the normally rich, elegant sound of the Berlin Philharmonic was at times not all that great - not the orchestra's fault, by any means, but it was, after all, recorded outdoors, during a rain storm.  Regardless, I am pleased to add it to my DVD/BluRay collection.  A great concert of a performance and recoding under less-than-optimal circumstances.",1517616000,,941,4.819875776397516

This review is based on the Blu-ray disc played in the DTS format.

This presents a popular programme based around the subject of the Rhine. Schumanns Symphony 3, the Rhenish, starts the concert which then continues with a substantial selection of Wagners music written mainly for his Ring cycle but also including the Liebestod from Tristan and the Act 3 Prelude from Lohengrin. Despite this considerable amount of operatic music the music is presented entirely in its orchestral format without any vocal contributions. The lack of any soloist makes this an unusual programme for the BPO at the end of season Waldbuhne concerts but this does not appear to bother the typically enthusiastic and packed audience.

Gustavo Dudamel, a popular young conductor with a considerable following, leads the orchestra through a programme that has been associated with this orchestra for decades. The music is therefore delivered with complete assurance throughout and will not disappoint although it is also true to say that there are no revelations either. For those, purchasers would do well to consider the renowned readings of the symphony by Szell, Sawallisch Gardiner and Kubelik on CD and Jarvi on BD for example as well as numerous famous selections of Wagners bleeding chunks also available on CD as well as Maazels orchestral presentation of the Ring available on BD with the BPO.

However, this is still an enjoyable occasion and much appreciated by the packed and enthusiastic audience who listen with obvious attention. It is this sense of occasion, rather like the VPO New Years Day concerts, that will attract many potential purchasers of this disc and, as such, it will give good satisfaction.

The visuals are particularly sharp and convey the event well. The DTS HD Master Audio is in 5.0 and not the advertised 5.1. It is arguable that the inclusion of a separate sub-woofer channel may have been an advantage in delivering a fuller bass response from an outdoor event but most will find this more than adequate. Sleeve notes, as has become typical these days, are minimal and relate to the track listing and the technical equipment and staff.

The disc offers a truthful presentation of a popular orchestral Waldbuhne concert with an amiable young conductor at the helm.",1507852800,3,2308,5.060526315789474
7982670,4,B00008G5ZV,"Being a WW II buff but not knowing much about the Eastern Front this dvd was educational.
I reccommend it to those with little knowledge of German and Russian front.  There are
some errors but few.  In a brief clip it shows a B-29 in 1943 dropping bombs on the
Germans.  I knew the war between the Germans and Russians was brutal and this shows
how brutal it was.  Get this dvd if you are a WW II buff.",1345507200,2,402,4.050632911392405
7982671,5,B00008G5ZV,"I think this is really ""Volume 2"" to the documentary ""The Road to Stalingrad""..and is very good ,,and well covers the battles on the Eastern front..after the Battle of Stalingrad..(Which was the turning point).

Also, I am surprised that this documentary has not been given more reviews , as they are both better than most i have seen and both cover  much more in detail and leaves out a lot of the propaganda stories and interviews regarding those stories. (unlike the BBC and ""History Channel"" documentaries.)",1326672000,,511,4.930232558139535
7982672,4,B00008G5ZV,"This DVD chronicles Adolf Hitler and the last days of the Third Reich.  It starts out with the battle of Stalingrad.  In the summer of 1942, the Germans launched Operation Barbarossa; the invasion of Russia.  Germany and Russia had signed a non-aggression pact earlier, but Germany, buoyed by her success in the West, turned on her former ally.  Initially, the Germans moved relatively freely through the Russian countryside.  The battles were fierce, but the Germans managed to keep the Russians on the run.  The Germans, sensing an easy victory, took no winter gear with them.  This omission proved to be a costly mistake.

The Germans managed to surround the Russian forces inside Stalingrad and they controlled virtually the entire city, but the Russians were able to counter-attack and soon the Germans were in full retreat.  This battle marked the beginning of the end for Germany.

The losses suffered on both sides were horrific.  Millions of Russians and thousands of Germans were killed during the war in the East.

This DVD uses actual footage taken during the fighting.  Although the photos are a little grainy, they really tell the story of the  war in the East and how brutal the fighting truly was.  This is a very good DVD.  The narration is helpful in understanding the battles, and each campaign from Stalingrad to the fall of Berlin is covered. One particular aspect I thought was covered especially well in this DVD was Hitler's refusal to let his Generals control the German Army.  It is mentioned numerous times in the DVD how Hitler overruled his commanders, and how some became so upset with him that several of the Generals planned an assassination attempt against Hitler.  Who knows what would have happened if Hitler would have simply let his leaders lead.  I recommend this DVD.  It has a lot of good information in it for people interested in the Russo-German battles of World War II.",1133395200,9,1913,4.881987577639752
