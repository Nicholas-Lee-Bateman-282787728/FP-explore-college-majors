8169257,2,B000MGVCZY,"This is not a very accurate depiction of the Battle of Little Bighorn.  The producers used incorrect pictures of several persons in the video, such as posting a picture of General George Crook while discussing General Alfred Terry.  They also talked about Crazy Horse while displaying a picture of some other Indian warrior,  since there are no authenticated pictures of Crazy Horse  (as far as historians know ).  Plys, the cavalry reenactors were carrying a 50 star U.S. flag.  Not worth the money,  in my opinion.",1462320000,3,516,4.930232558139535

8169259,5,B000MGVCZY,"This is narrated/commented by an Englishman. Strangely, this DVD gets more things right that most of the other DVDs I've viewed. Very good DVD. I recommend it over many of the other Bighorn DVDs.",1429747200,2,195,4.764705882352941

8169263,5,B000MGVCZY,Very good depiction of the true war between the Indians and Custer.  An important piece of history.  Custer didn't count on the Indians having a very excellent strategy for attack.,1364256000,4,180,4.966666666666667
8169264,4,B000MGVCZY,"GOOD MOVIE FOR THE MONEY. THE MAIN ACTOR MAKES THE MOVIE WORTH WATCHING. I AM NOT SURE THE ENDING WAS CORRECT WITH THE WAY IT WENT DOWN, BUT I DID NOT GET IT FOR A HISTORY LESSON.",1345766400,2,179,3.864864864864865
8169265,1,B000MGVCZY,Spend your money on another Custer dvd. This is a waste of that and time. It gives only the most rudimentary details of the battle and is blatantly biased against Custer. Take my word. Don't buy this dvd.,1340236800,10,204,4.394736842105263
8169266,3,B000MGVCZY,"This dvd gives a broad overview of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, with little to gain from it, that a history buff or person intrigued by the events that took place on June 25, 1876 might find to be second-nature to their own knowledge of the battle.  The dvd explores a story that has been established time and time again through books and films also pertaining to the subject.  I would only recommend this product to someone who knows very little about the Battle of the Little Bighorn. I would recommend the much stronger version of the story in the documentary/film ""Last Stand at Little Bighorn"".",1190592000,44,604,4.635514018691588
