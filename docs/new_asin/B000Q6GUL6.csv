2832063,5,B000Q6GUL6,This film was excellent.. I loved it..and great amazon service.. I would watch this again and again and recommend anyone to buy this dvd or any dvd in this way from Amazon (also super fat delivery),1344384000,,197,4.5
2832064,4,B000Q6GUL6,"A funny comedy of 20+ brothers, full of life, sexual desire, nice to watch at.

You will like it, surely, as I did watching during a long weekend yesterday.",1244505600,2,156,4.379310344827586
2832065,2,B000Q6GUL6,"this is disgusting. if you are into crude humor, this is for you. it is really feral. though the end few minutes are ok. Brenden f was good. chris kline is his usual devoid of talent.",1234742400,3,183,4.111111111111111
2832066,1,B000Q6GUL6,"You know I expected so much more from the creators of ""American pie"". That was at least funny.  I personally do not think watching a woman wipe semen off of her leg and then gargleing it. Or listening to a guy who is sitting on the can with diarreha funny!  And that pretty well sums up this movie.  If you like the aforementioned stuff in your movies,  then knock your socks off and rent.  If however, you are like me then you would do best to avoid this.  Try super bad. That one was good as well. this one not so good.",1197072000,8,521,4.0588235294117645
2832067,5,B000Q6GUL6,I thought this movie was so funny and really enjoyed it.  It is an adult movie so DO NOT let kids watch this because there is alot of nudity and sex scenes.  It has alot of sex humor in it which was great and made me laugh all through it.  I can't believe I never heard of this movie until I saw it in the video store!  Enjoy.,1185840000,,326,3.75

8194530,5,B000Q6GUL6,This is one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. The little jokes and quips are just as funny as the big set ups. This is a must buy for anyone who likes this style of comedy.,1476144000,,178,3.8378378378378377
