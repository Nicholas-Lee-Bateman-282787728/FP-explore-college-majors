1920498,4,B0000D1FGF,"Mixing epochs and people-major characters are being performed by the same actors, did they?-it is still, ninety years on since appearing, a powerful testimony to a human endless creative imaginary correlated with technical means available to date in particular social environments.

Looking outdated technically, it is a good work to remake.",1329436800,,341,5.686274509803922

1920500,5,B0000D1FGF,"As is widely known by film buffs, INTOLERANCE was created by the silent film (USA) king D.W. Griffith as a sort of apology for the overt racism in his historic BIRTH OF A NATION. That film was set during the Civil War & Reconstruction in America's South. There were artistic elements & innovative techniques in BIRTH OF A NATION that were so fresh & vivid that they popped up almost 30 years later in GONE WITH THE WIND. Both films celebrated racist reaction. Nonetheless, unlike GONE WITH THE WIND, BIRTH OF A NATION was of such historical cinematic significance that in all conscience I could only deduct a single star to protest the racist message. Fortunately, I didn't have that problem with INTOLERANCE.

It is an unequivocal masterpiece.

The most famous scene in the movie is set in Babylon and depicts mammoth elephant pillars that support multiple levels of terraces, gardens & a huge palatial palace. Hundreds of actors are shown walking up & down an enormous central stairway. The set itself is an achievement that in many ways has never been duplicated since (with the possible exception of the 60's extravaganzas like BEN HUR & CLEOPATRA.) Griffith knows what he's got to work with & allows the camera to take its time focusing on every section & level of this Gargantuan & breath-taking set.

Another great scene that takes place on the same set is dance of women & a man who are celebrating the entrance of the foreign goddess Ishtar into Babylon. If you really watch the dance you can see how sophisticated it is, the skill of the dancers, and the obvious enjoyment they take in their art.

These observations represent a small portion of the film's entire scope. The director contrasts various historic ages in which intolerance is revealed on a mythic scale. Another personal favorite of mine is the representation of Catherine d'Medici the scheming Queen Mother of France. She was a driving force behind the notorious St. Bartholomew's Massacre of the French Protestants known as Huguenots (depicted in the movie.) Catherine d'Medici is portrayed as looking like a bloated hairy beetle just about to pop. It's funny, yes, but the actress is appropriately rather fascinating & repellent.

INTOLERANCE is highly entertaining and an archival essential.

If you haven't already seen it, do yourself a favor & do.

1920501,3,B0000D1FGF,I did not have any problem with this item.  I would buy from Amazon.com again.  It was an Alpha Video and in the past about 75% of Alpha Video's have one or both problems in the video production and in the audio.  I just received an order containing two Alpha videos and I will be returning both because the video quality is very poor and the audio is not much better.,1254528000,2,368,4.154929577464789
1920502,3,B0000D1FGF,"That's to stop my jaw dropping like a brick. The line comes from the Babylon story. The Mountain Maid (Daisy Mae?) also says she'll slap her girdle. Not a saying I'm familiar with. I have to be frank about this creation. The division into 4 parts is a help. I've only watched two, so far, Babylon and the Huguenots, and am giving the rest a rest for the time being. Also, I seem to have picked up the worse of the two versions: my disc lacks the coloured tintings. The visual vision is gob-smacking, as everyone agrees, but the rest is unbelievably naive. Considering the kind of literature that was being written during this decade, DWG seems hardly out of infant school. So you have to honour his achievements, without admiring them for their narrative sophistication. Everything in the Babylon story hovers uneasily between the comically bad and the overpowering. Allowances must be made, I suppose, but there's a limit to tolerance: not everything is acceptable.

After sitting through the next two stories: the Judean and the Modern, I revise my opinion upwards. The Judean is mercifully short, and makes its few points fairly effectively. There are one or two nice shots. Some inspired by the pious paintings of Victorian artists. The Modern story is quite coherent, and quite well-paced. The plot is fairly well conceived, and there's quite an element of suspense. Will the wrongfully convicted man get suspended, or will he be saved? These stories could have made 4 reasonable shorter separate films. They don't really mesh together too well. I can't quite face sitting through the whole lot from beginning to end. You have to acknowledge, however, that DWG certainly set the pattern for a lot of later film-making: I kept getting reminded of other movies that were made much later.",1199491200,5,1790,4.8881578947368425
1920503,1,B0000D1FGF,"This cheapy version of Griffith's ""Intolerance"" (as opposed to the Kino version) is practically unwatchable -- out of focus, poorly scanned, and at times you can even detect tracking lines (i.e. this DVD was simply transferred from a videocassette version).  Would not recommend at all.  Check out the Kino version, as they tend to do good job at transfering old silent films to DVD.

The 1 star review is not reflective of Griffith's film.  It is one of my favorite silent films and probably the most ambitious film ever made in terms of casting, sets and the enormity of the timespan of the four separate stories.  This film is probably much more representative of Griffith's acievements than the racist and way outdated ""Birth of a Nation.""  So this film deserves to be preserved properly, not in this bastardized cheapy version.  Alas, I got what I paid for :-(",1104710400,44,865,4.804054054054054
1920504,3,B0000D1FGF,"D. W. Griffith's films are badly dated now. Birth of a Nation is historically important, but violently racist. Intolerance isn't overtly racist, but just as simple-minded. On the other hand, no one, in the history of film, has ever been as ambitious. No one else has taken four different stories, from four different historical periods, and combined them in one grand epic - like four tributaries flowing into one great river. For students of film only.",1080777600,4,453,4.973684210526316
7999796,2,B0000D1FGF,"This 1937 version of Mill on the Floss with James Mason and Geraldine Fitzgerald is packaged in a brightly colored jacket of nice quality.. However, this film version is an unrestored black and white copy, not of high quality. The film is dark and scratchy, and some of the dialogue track does not align with the actors who are speaking. None of this may matter to historical film buffs who want to see a young James Mason and Geraldine Fitzgerald. The 1939s films Wuthering Heights and Dark Victory, both starring Geraldine Fitzgerald, are far superior black and white films.",1435363200,,576,4.828282828282828

7999798,2,B0000D1FGF,"One reason I like certain very old movies is they give you a glimpse into lifestyles when the film was shot. However, this film is mostly set in ancient times (Babylon, etc.). The sets are wonderful considering the antiquity of this movie, but of course they pale in comparison to modern productions. The viewing quality was poor, with much darkness intruding on the picture frame. You'll have to be a real silent film geek to enjoy this dinosaur.",1389571200,,447,4.743589743589744

7999800,2,B0000D1FGF,The alpha video version I bought was awful. Stopped at 90 minutes and 2:30. If you want to see this get a good version.,1388448000,,119,4.0
7999801,5,B0000D1FGF,Great example of a very early silent movie with awesome cinematography.  The story of Intolerance in the three periods covered created transitions used in later movies.  This is a true original.,1386806400,,194,5.225806451612903
7999802,3,B0000D1FGF,"First of all, the video transfer (Alpha Video) is terrible, to the extent some parts are barely watchable.  This movie would only be about an hour long if the subtitles were shorter.  As they are most 1st graders could read them in a few seconds.  I find myself re-reading the dialog several times during these pauses.

In spite of these technical difficulties I found myself enjoying this way long silent classic.  Director Griffith seems to be apologizing for the racist, if otherwise technically brilliant, ""Birth of a Nation"" here with the intolerance theme.  There are 4 individual stories.  Most of the attention is given to the first 2.  The first is a modern times romance of sorts where two lovers are thrown together by chance and have a child, only to be hampered by temperance do-gooders and a near death experience with the hangman.  The second is the lavish story of the fall of Babylon.  This is the one I enjoyed the most, with some thinly veilled nudity and other debauchery.  I wish I could have a clean copy to see.

The other 2 stories are given less screen time yet central to the overall theme.  One involves Jesus and his forgiveness of the adulterer.  You know, he who is without sin cast the first stone.  Then, the crucifixion.  The fourth story is about the French Catholic (king and queen) slaughter of the Protestants on St. Bartholomew's Day.  The scope is grand and the stories do work together.  If I get a better copy in the future, I may give it another shot.  Oh yeah, Tod Browning has a bit part, helping to write the story and was a second unit director.  On to fame as the director of ""Dracula"".",1380758400,2,1633,4.56551724137931
7999803,3,B0000D1FGF,"Perhaps I'm just being high maintenance and unreceptive to change, but the first version of the film I ever saw was one with alternating colored film (Blue for the cradle sequences, green for the French, red for any battle scene, and straight black-and-white for the modern tale) along with composition by Joseph Turren (or 'Turrin'?). THIS IS NOT THAT VERSION. If you saw the same version I did and are considering this DVD as a purchase, don't. Frankly I wouldn't recommend this rendition to anyone. The assorted samples of classical music from Mozart and Beethoven do not coincide with the images on screen in any way shape or form. The song choices that you here at the strike massacre and when Jesus saves the adulterer make the most serious of scenes appear comic.
Maybe that doesn't matter to you - but if it does I would recommend either muting the television whilst you watch (thus creating an authentic silent cinematic experience) or just buying another release (I believe the version I saw was the 2002 Kino International Corp. release).
Other than these complaints of this mildly OCD movie-viewer, this DVD shows the picture well enough (save for a few instances where the texts were blotted out by a mysterious mass of white).
Also, the version I for-mentioned exceeded three hours whereas this disc hardly passes 2:40. One more reason that I would look else where for a means of viewing ""Intolerance"".",1377388800,2,1416,4.8796680497925315
7999804,2,B0000D1FGF,Having watched Birth of a Nation video (from another surce) I found the quality of this reproduction way below par. Tough to read the titles and the video was not sharp at the four corners.,1375488000,,189,4.428571428571429
7999805,2,B0000D1FGF,"I think the promotion for this film is way overstating the quality of it. When it was new it was probably quite wonderful, but, unfortunately no more. It has pages of text explaining what is going on or about to which is not readable because of the deterioration. The scenes are also in bad condition. A complete image is unusual. It was tedious to watch, so I turned it off and didn't see it to the end. I would not recommend buying it.",1368576000,,437,4.27710843373494
