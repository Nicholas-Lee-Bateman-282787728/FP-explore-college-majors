8545806,5,B009ZVHXY6,"I grew up watching Hopalong Cassidy movies, when I was a kid, in the 50s and early 60s. Watching them again, so many years later, I was not disappointed; the plots are more complex than you might imagine, and the quality of the print isn't bad at all for its age (better on a smaller screen though). Watching them today takes me back to a simpler life, and in today's frantic world this is not a bad thing. Why can't they make westerns like these today?",1458259200,,453,4.27906976744186
8545807,5,B009ZVHXY6,My husband and I remember going to the theater on Saturdays to see Hoppy  as children.  It  was fun watching them again.  And our 4 grandsons really like watching them too.,1456617600,,172,4.451612903225806
8545808,5,B009ZVHXY6,"This boxed set contains 7 discs and a total of 31 movies plus some bonus programs.  I just received this and have not actually had time to view the movies.  I did want to make sure that everyone knows that this is a boxed set and has 31 movies not just 5 movies.  I had to do a lot of research before purchasing this item as all the reviews were about a 1 disc 5 movie item.  Once I've watched all the movies I'll try and come back with a review.  However, You can't go wrong with Hopalong Cassidy partners!  Below is a track listing for this item.
