8097468,5,B000CCRX1A,"The barbers depicted in this dying art are adept conversants; each can maintain conversation with customers as well as tell good stories. Some of the training stories are a bit over the top, especially the ones involving straight razors, which is why I bought it. I only wish that the DVD had included a professional walk through of a straight razor shave given by a barber posted here: [...]",1266105600,,392,4.695652173913044
8097469,5,B000CCRX1A,"great documentary of an unfortunate dying industry.

nice perspectives from a good variety of barbers from different backgrounds and different parts of the country.

informative, yet hilarious at times listening to the older guys take friendly jabs at one another in their home-away-from-home setting... the local barber shop!

a nice length of about 60 mins. plus some extras and about a 20 min. feature of the 'barber museum'.",1198540800,,428,5.264705882352941
8097470,5,B000CCRX1A,"I expected this to be a mildly interesting human-interest piece but I found it more than mildly interesting, and in the span of less than an hour (not counting the terrific extras), I felt a real closeness to each of the barbers interviewed. The film covers lots of cool history of barbering that goes back to the days of (purposeful) blood-letting and the removal of teeth and stitches. It also includes some humorous and eeeky stories of shaving mishaps and high-stress barber-school exams. Most enjoyable though, is the atmosphere and kibitzing that goes on in barbershops. If nothing else, this is a film about the lost art of conversation. There are lots of documentaries out there in recent years about the different parts of America's personal history that are being lost to gentrification and corporate monopolies. This is among the best of them. See this movie and then go out and support your local barber.",1163548800,3,916,4.916129032258064
