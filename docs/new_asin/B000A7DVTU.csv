8075475,3,B000A7DVTU,"Like the title says the transfer sucks. The picture shakes and is full of dust marks and bubbles. Being an AMC release I figured it would be of decent quality but this came out before AMC exploded so they didn't hurt their name with this bad quality. 5 stars for Victor Buono as the Strangler, 0 stars for the picture quality.",1371254400,,326,4.360655737704918

8075477,1,B000A7DVTU,"I bought this exact same DVD, with the same cover, in the Store.  Right out of the box, I tried to watch ""The Strangler,"" with Victor Buono.  I did say ""tried.""  There was NO sound.  A bit of low keyed something which I guess was supposed to be the soundtrack.  But it didn't transfer onto this DVD.  It's a shame because I saw this movie before and enjoyed it.

I took it back to the store for a refund.",1280880000,,404,4.037974683544304
