This DVD demonstrates the contemporary art of kumdo,

The cover of this DVD, which looks like a person in Japanese kendo protective gear, is an accurate indication of the content of this DVD.  This DVD is an introduction to the Korean version of kendo, which is called kumdo in Korean.  This a sport uses a 4 foot long split bamboo stick, as opposed to a real metal sword.  This video begins with a brief discussion of kendo's Korean roots.  The rest of the video is an orientation to a Korean kumdo class. Students see how to bow, to sit, to meditate, and how to move on the floor.  Students don heavy protective gear, learn to strike with a four foot long split bamboo ""sword"".  Strikes to the heavily protected head, wrists and trunk are demonstrated.  The moves are swift, forward and back motions, in sharp contrast to the circular motions of the Korean sword arts that use real metal swords, as shown in the publisher's other DVDs Haedong Kumdo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haedong-Kumdo-Korean-Sword-Martial-Art/dp/B000BBYSOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haedong Kumdo: Korean Sword Martial Art</a>&nbsp;and Ancient Korean Sword and Korean Arts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korean-Sword-and-Weapon-Arts-DVD/dp/B000CC45WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korean Sword and Weapon Arts DVD</a>. Kumdo is a sport for exercise and personal development, rather than for practical military application. Unlike the other DVDs, there are no form demonstrations.

This DVD is more interesting than many martial arts instructional videos.  Its purpose is different.  This is an introduction to kumdo for people considering that sport. For people considering kumdo, its serves its pupose well as it would help potential students decide if they would like to sign up for a class.  For those who have already decided they prefer a martial art with steel swords and practical defense applications, one of the other two videos would probably be more in line with your goals.",1188432000,10,2576,6.541176470588235
