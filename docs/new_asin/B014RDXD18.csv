7420680,5,B014RDXD18,"Roxy & Elsewhere was never one of my favorite Zappa albums  I always felt I was missing out on the visual component, and now I see thats the case because its amazing to watch these guys perform. Cheepnis Percussion alone is worth the price of admission. I only wish it had more music to offset the audience-participation number Be Bop Tango, which is almost as tedious to watch as it was to listen to on the record when you couldn't see what was going on. So Id dock it half a star for that  and for their having made it one of the tracks on the accompanying cd instead of the sublime Inca Roads or Slime/Swifty. We already have this plodder on R&E and don't need it again!",1446249600,21,673,4.25
7420681,5,B014RDXD18,"This movie is awesome & exactly what I always hoped it would be. No annoying claymation that loses its lustre after 2 minutes; no seizure- inducing quick shot changes as in ""Token""; just Zappa & arguably his best band ever, all playing at the top of their game. So thankful that the ZFT persevered the hardships in restoring this footage; it was worth the effort. Simply said, if you're any bit of a Zappa fan, you'll want this!",1446249600,29,428,4.5
7420682,5,B014RDXD18,"This... is what we've been waiting for. The band is top notch, the performances tight, the music complex yet approachable. I understand the technical difficulties of synching the audio to the video kept this in the vault for decades, and to finally see it realized is a blessing. Many diehard fans will miss a few songs from the Roxy and Elsewhere album, but the movie moves along briskly at about two hours and is massively satisfying. The camerawork is fairly pedestrian but ultimately stays out of the way and lets the music speak for itself. And what glorious music it is. This is arguably the most accomplished version of the Mothers, and the precision of the playing brings out the humor, warmth, and musicality of Frank's compositions. No pyrotechnics are needed to bring a smile to the faces of the audiences then or now. Heartily recommended.",1446163200,29,851,4.835616438356165
7420683,5,B014RDXD18,"Just watched it for the first time. Other than wanting more of it, it is everything you have hoped for.

Highlights for me were the original, slower and slightly-different arrangement of Inca Roads, the Cheepnis-Percussion segment (Where Ralph Humphries and Ruth Underwood really shine), and Big Swifty. George Duke steals the show with all of his...stuff. And to see this band play Cheepnis, with all the goofy stuff going on onstage...well, that just about made my life.

Only thing I felt was missing was Village Of The Sun before Enchida's Arf. I've heard those three tunes played together for so long, I think of them as a suite. Perhaps there was something wrong with the video that was just impossible to repair or sync properly with the audio.

There's really nothing more that can be said. If you've been waiting for it for many years (as so many of us have), just order it. If you've never experienced much of Frank Zappa and have heard about this much-hyped concert release only recently, order it, and see one of the finest bands that ever graced a stage.

7420684,5,B014RDXD18,"I have listened to and collected Frank Zappa's music since I first saw him on Saturday Night Live on October 21, 1978.  I saw him live in concert eight times between 1980 and 1988.  ""Roxy the Movie"" is among the coolest and best Zappa concert footage I have seen in thirty-seven years.  The playing is great, the song selection is great, and the sound is great (especially on the 24/48 LPCM stereo audio track).  If you are longtime fan or just looking to get into FZ's music, do not miss it!

By the way, two of the best performances on the Roxy Blu-ray are not part of the film proper, but are extras found in a sub-menu.  I am referring to ""Pygmy Twylyte"" and a song about President Nixon being a not-so-good guy (I am circumlocuting at this present time in order to get this text on Amazon).",1446163200,3,795,4.337837837837838

7420686,5,B014RDXD18,"Then I watched a movie from Hollywood.
This IS that movie from Hollywood - specifically from the Roxy Theater in Hollywood - that Zappa fans have been waiting for what seems like FOREVER!
It is shorter than I'd like - citing that Montana and Dupree's Paradise have been floating around for 10+ years as a preview to the film, and they're not included in the flnal cut.
I'm sure it was very expensive for the Zappa Family Trust to put out the finished film at any length, and it is a respectable (over) 2 hours extravaganza (including the songs available as a bonus feature.)
So although not everything the Zappa devotee could want in this, the Holy Grail of all Zappa video entertainment to come our way, it surely is a toe-curling delight to finally see the greatest assemblange of Zappa's Mothers, along with the stage antics only available until now as audio on the masterpiece Roxy & Elsewhere album.
Great Googly Moogly!!

If you are a fan of Frank Zappa, this movie is a necessity.  This set of concert footage/scenes totally conveys all the complexity, the silliness and the utter musical mastery of this group of players at this moment in time.

7420690,5,B014RDXD18,"A One Star, Five Star review.  The five stars are for Frank and the Mothers.  The one star is for the incredibly bad cinematography, direction, and editing..  It's difficult to describe how bad the production values are, and how unfortunate it is until you see the movie.  I'm not sure the director and photographers understood that they were recording a concert, and that Frank Zappa was the single most important person on stage.  Part of the fun of a Zappa concert was seeing Frank conduct the musicians with hand signals, and the on-stage antics of the musicians as they interacted with the music and each other.

Most of that is ignored by the film crew as they concentrate extended close-ups of George Duke's hands playing keyboards to the exclusion of Napoleon Murphy Brock obviously cavorting around stage.  Perhaps the best illustration of the total tone-deafness of the movie crew to the concert and Zappa is the introduction to Cheapnis.  If you've listened to The Roxy and Elsewhere for nearly 40 years like I have, you could just imagine Frank describing the size and length of the scientists' ties with his hands.  What do you get in the movie during this introduction?  A freaking close-up of the TOP OF HIS HEAD.  Yeah, he's introducing Cheapnis, and these idiots are focused on his HAIR for the ENTIRE introduction.

He did this three nights in a row and you guys never caught on to the fact that you needed to show that?  Oh, my...my,,,my you are idiots.

They couldn't even pickup on what needed to be covered when Frank telegraphed the performer to highlight.  When Ruth Underwood is built-up by Zappa as she going to be doing something special with percussion and is finally unleashed with, ""ladies and gentlemen, here's Ruth..""  The cinema idiots are looking at the floor...yeah...we needed to see the wires and stomp boxes...and not Ruth.  When she does the percussion solo - they're focused elsewhere on the stage and give only brief, very badly framed and shot glimpses of Ruth.

The music is wonderful, the production values of this movie are abysmal - and 20 other synonyms that describe a poorly shot, badly directed movie with editing that is amateurish at best.

Hopefully, they've found jobs as greeters at Walmart because that's about the limit of their talent, and no one lets them near a creative endeavor again.

I understand this was shot on film and one of the problems is that cameras run out of film rapidly and you can lose an entire performance if they run out simultaneously.  In fact, Martin Scorsese had the problem in the Last Waltz when Muddy Waters came on stage.  All of the cameras, save one were being reloaded.  Luckily, he had Laszlo Kovacs as one of his cinematographers, and Kovacs was far sighted enough to have already reloaded his camera and provided solo coverage of Water's performance until other cameras could be reloaded and start recording the performance.

There are techniques you can use to ensure that coverage is always provided, which I'm betting wasn't done, thus giving the editor little flexibility in choosing shots to edit between - and so we see an extended view of Frank's hair instead of the Cheapnis introduction, and close-ups of the floor instead of Ruth Underwood.

Enjoy the music and try to not get too overly frustrated by the dreadful production values.",1498089600,3,3338,4.834507042253521
7420691,5,B014RDXD18,"Zappa can have a tendency to scare away casual rock fans with most of the projects he put together. You will need to have an appreciation for playing music to appreciate this show on most levels but it's a beautiful compromise of his oddly ugly orchestral arrangements and stunning ""rock"" grooves that lay out a perfect canvas to show off the stunning skill of every member of this lineup. ""Pygmy Twilight"" is performed with a lovely young lady's tempestuous dancing for each member of the group. If nothing else, just the release of this show is an engineering miracle of modern technology.

I always wondered what happened to the movie Frank mentions in the album.  Now I know it was waiting in the infamous Zappa vault waiting to be edited and released.  All I can say is that it was worth the wait.  Great video (film) great angles and cuts, great energy and great music.  I was surprised by some of the songs in the movie that were not on the album like RDNZ (I didn't even know that had been written yet) and Geroge Duke's great start to Inca Roads.  At the same time I miss Village of Sun, Dummy Up, Son of Orange County and More Trouble Everyday.

7420729,5,B014RDXD18,"If you've never heard of Frank Zappa, but would like a ""best of"" album to lead you into his esthetic, the ROXY movie wouldn't be a bad choice. When Zappa and the Mothers recorded this film, in December of 1973, the world was witnessing what is arguably the pinnacle from the most iconoclastic, musically astute composer arising out of the 1960s rock upper echelon. After the original Mothers of Invention merged avant garde classical with satire music, jazz, blues, and psychedelia, Zappa the solo artist nose dived into his most musically sophisticated period, from HOT RATS right up to ONE SIZE FITS ALL. During that period, his experiments in several areas of music merged to produce the spectacular you see here. Some of the luminaries of the jazz scene, like George Duke on piano, combine with the Fowler brothers, Ruth Underwood on percussion, Chester Thompson on drums, Ralph Humphrey on drums, Napoleon Murphy Brock on lead vocals, sax and flute, and of course, Zappa on guitar, lead vocals and percussion. I won't cheapen the experience, by describing how wonderful the performance is. I've been listening to the ROXY album forever. Now, I feel like I was at the performance. I have Zappa in my collection that matches this performance, but little if anything surpasses it.

Zappa has often cited this band as his favorite. The quote I remember, was he said he didn't understand why people had a ""fetish"" for the original Mothers, when this band was so much better. The ROXY band performs material from UNCLE MEAT, which I couldn't believe was being performed live. If you know that album, you realize how thick the overdubs were in many places, particular the dense percussion experiments. That music is performed live during the DOG MEAT section. It's a site to behold. Ruth playing crazy fast marimba parts, Chester and Ralph drumming these complicated patterns, with Zappa also drumming on the Timpani parts. This texture was always a favorite part of his Mother's material.  Zappa's genius laid in his understanding of complicated rhythmic layers, and jazz modal melodies. Of course, George Duke amazes, as always. Then, you can watch Zappa's guitar solos, some of the best guitar ever played by humanity. This music is avante guard third stream jazz rock. With a Zappa comedy routine thrown in, for the teen scene. (The dance contest from BEBOP TANGO is the comedy routine, for this show.) So what parts of Zappa's catalogue will you see, and how does the movie fit with Zappa's other video releases?

Of course, if you've seen A TOKEN OF HIS EXTREME, then you have an idea what to expect. However, the ROXY show adds in Ralph Humphrey on drums, and Bruce Fowler on Trombone. (And two more musicians make a world of difference, with the sonic texture and colors.) If you were to take the material from the TOKEN / KCET concert of August 27, 1974, and merge it with the ROXY movie from December 1973, you'd have almost all the songs from the ROXY AND ELSEWHERE album. ROXY the MOVIE has some new live versions to offer the ZAPPA devotee, like a reworked version of COSMIC DEBRIS, the amazing DOG/MEAT section, RDNZL, Zappa's TV commentary I""M THE SLIME, an excellent version of his jazz rock classic BIG SWIFTY from ""Waka/Jawaka"", and an in the studio film from the ""Apostrophe"" sessions. Even with the songs I know inside out from listening to the ROXY ELSEWHERE album, it still comes across brand new, from finally being able to watch the stage antics. It's been a forty year wait until the technology could evolve that could fix the synchronization issues from the original filming of the show. The only sadness I felt, came from thinking about the musicians I've known who were Zappa fans that passed away, before they were able to watch this movie in all its magnificence. The soundtrack to this film is easily among the very best Zappa music I've ever heard. This band was a 16 armed monster, truly ferocious in its power. A must own for any Zappa fan, or newbie wondering what all the fuss was about.",1477958400,,4021,4.7994227994228
7420730,5,B014RDXD18,"The reason to like Zappa's music is because it's so lively and energetic. It's on full display with this disc. Any fan of Zappa should own this. A standout is ""Cheepnis Percussion"" You can see how much fun the musicians are having playing his music. He always brought out the best in his band. According to the liner notes it was very difficult to produce this film. The work put into creating this wonderful document was not in vain. Anyone who loves Zappa's music...or anyone who wants to be entertained should watch this and enjoy an artist at his best. It can be hard to convert a non Zappa fan to his music in the pre Dancin' Fool era. And that is a great shame. This show is Zappa at his 'showman's' best. Watch and enjoy, music fans.

The trombone-sax duel in ""Be-Bop Tango""....and to finally see the dancers after all these years of just ""hearing"" them on the recordso much of this is just incredible to watch.

The camera handlers show decent restraint in that regard. And it's not just a bunch of facial close ups; we get to watch the musicians PLAY. My only real objection is the fact that someone decided to DNR this footage into oblivion. Yes, it banished the film grain, but some of the shots look like paintings instead of reality. I also suspect that this may have been shot 1:33 full frame and was zoomed (and cropped) to fill up TV screens. That would accentuate the grain, so maybe that's why they slathered on the visual noise reduction. This same approach appears to be evident on The Doors live set. Personally, I'd rather have the grain and the added detail. Anyway, after a couple of minutes the quality of the performances becomes the main attraction.

The problem is with the Blu-Ray master. After all the work that was done restoring the film, they went and ran the whole thing through digital noise reduction (DNR) , presumably to remove film grain. I am not sure why people have a problem with film grain, but this is not the first disc I have purchased in which they did this. When you remove the grain of the original film, you also remove detail in the picture. What you end up with is people with no blemishes on their skin and a kind of blurry, waxy, smudged look to what used to be a detailed picture. It's not as bad as the Predator Blu-Ray which is a notorious example, but considering the work that was done to restore the movie, it really is a crime someone decided to mess it up like this by running it through some dumb computer program. Leave the film as it looked , grain, detail and all.  Just because most movies are filmed digitally these days and lack grain, does not mean it should be wiped from historical films.

7420758,4,B014RDXD18,"It took a lot of work to synchronize the audio and the video of those concerts from those 3 nights
at the Roxy in 1973. Don't expect a very clear picture, but who really cares when you can have a
Zappa performance on video from the 70's. There is no big visuals effects on a Zappa concert. The
music is what it counts. It's kind of funny to see Tom Fowler with a big cigar in the mouth for a
long period of time and Frank smoking his cigarette sitting on a chair when he is not busy. The
rhythm section with 3 musicians is solid including the young Chester Thompson. They play a important
role in the show. As usual no music of Frank Zappa can be without flute, trumpet and xylophone. It
is always impressive to hear how much the music here was original with some adventurous time
signatures mixing prog, jazz and avant-garde.

But i personally never enjoyed the Zappa guitar's solo and at the end of the show when Frank invites
people from the crowd on stage to dance during some insane improvised music. It was maybe fun for
the audience, but watch this for 20 minutes on video is not my kind of thing. The editing of those
shows was made to keep the cameras long enough on each members to enjoy the solos. The audio is nice
for a concert that took place 40 year ago and acceptable considering the technical issues they had
to overcome. This is not a perfect product, but a rare and precious thing to have in your prog
collection. It comes with a single cd that contains 6 of the 11 songs on video.",1459900800,2,1500,4.2631578947368425

7420762,5,B014RDXD18,"I do NOT own this Blu-Ray. I am basing my review on seeing this film at a screening at the Egyptian theater in Hollywood last year, hosted by Ahmet Zappa. I've been a Zappa fan for years, and have had the privilege of seeing him play live twice, the first time being somewhere between 1976 and 1979 (the Bozzio years. Massive quantities of chemicals keep me from remembering exactly). So, this stint at the Roxy was just before my time. Or, so I thought...

This is one amazing concert film. I now feel like I was actually there in 1973 for this concert (okay, this film is edited together over three nights at the Roxy). If you are a Zappa fan, this has to be at the top of your list for Blu-Rays. If you are not a Zappa fan, but wonder what it's like for real musicians to play real instruments on stage, you can't do better. (There is some live Gentle Giant stuff that rivals the musicianship ship here. You should seek those out, also).

Roxy the Movie is fantastic, it is the missing element in my decades old Zappa collection, no wonder people are raving about it. And what a hell of a job it was to get this put together with all the technical challenges they faced in syncing the picture and sound.

But I am particularly annoyed by Amazon because they love - they really seem to LOVE - putting Japanese scam artists online pretending to be offering goods they don't have but - if you place an order - they will then try and source in Japan.

7420796,5,B014RDXD18,"I haven't had a chance to view the DVD, so I will only review the accompanying CD, and will add my review of the movie later.

The background story is easily available, but to summarize, in 1973 Zappa played a concert at the famous Roxy club in Los Angeles in 1973 and filmed the show for an airing on the local PBS affiliate.  The audio recording was edited, overdubbed in the studio, and combined with recordings from a subsequent tour, and released in 1974 as Roxy and Elsewhere, which in many fans opinions, including mine, is one of the pinnacles of Zappas discography.  This is definitely one of Zappas most talented bands, and the music combines complex compositions and arrangements, tight ensemble playing, the usual goofy humor and grooves.

The release of this film, which Zappa always intended to do, was long delayed due to technical challenges stemming from errors in the synchronization of audio & video and other problems.

The accompanying CD features most, but not all, of the songs that appear in the video.  The prior CD release Roxy by Proxy contains this material plus several tracks not present on this CD.  The tracks are presented here without the edits and overdubs on Roxy & Elsewhere, and there are several not included on that album.  Ive always found Beebop Tango extended audience participation section a bit tedious to listen, but its interesting to listen to it (at least once).  Some of the previously edited banter fills in clues about what hes talking about.  The instrumental section at the begining is longer than what appears on Roxy and Elsewhere, which is appreciated.  Very good versions of Uncle Meat & RDNZL add to the instrumental content.  Cozmik Debris is presented in a slower, bluesier, work-in-progress version than would end up on Apostrophe the next year.  Another surprise is the drum solo version of Cheepnis, which precedes the full version.  Truth be told, most of the edits and overdubs did serve to improve the final product on Roxy & Elsewhere, and though I haven't heard it personally, it seems that Roxy by Proxy contains a more complete recording of this concert, but the CD makes a nice companion to the video, so 5 stars for the CD.

Almost every Zappa fan, by now, knows the story of Roxy the Movie. How the sound and the footage languished for 40 years because the technology to repair a horrible, horrible mistake that was made during all four shows hadn't reached a point where it could be showed. At all!! Not even a little. Every once in a while FZ would attempt to apply current methods to repair the damage but after decades of trying new ideas and buying the best tech at his disposal it couldn't be repaired to Frank's satisfaction.

The project went back to the vault to wait for the technology to come around. And then, in 2015, yep, last year, Roxy the Movie was released on Blu-ray. The liner notes by John Albarian, who edited this together are a brief, amusing look at the project. As for what you see and hear on the disk:

The musicianship, song choices and execution by FZ and the Mothers is extraordinary. Consummate professionals at their peak. Rockers will love it, jazz lovers will love it and goofballs like me will love it. The sound quality through my home theater system was amazing. I chose to go two channel for the initial pass but will be running it again in 5.1 with ""live"" filtration. It bumped, it rocked and I could hear every instrument even when the camera wasn't on that instrument.

Video quality was very, very impressive on my 55"" LED Samsung. Very focused, no noise or distortion that I could see. Very sharp images throughout. No hot-spots or blocky shadows that I could see at all. I find this very rare in concert videos from that time. The editing was extraordinary. No ""smash cut"" MTV-style editing, it flowed, it moved and it enhanced the experience of being onstage with the band. It went close in when it needed to and broadened out when it needed to. And with that stage and that many musicians this couldn't have been easy.

To sum it all up. This Blu-ray was money well spent. A marvelous account of this week in 1973. A preserved slice of a turbulent time in music and world politics (Vietnam was still very much an issue) and in chaotic domestic unrest. Frozen on the fingertips of Zappa conducting his passion for us, his music, his musicians and himself. Amazing. Buy this and watch it over and over. Make your friends watch it. Make your kids watch it.

Let me add one note of negativity. It's about that audience (more accurately those FOUR audiences) at The Roxy on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in 1973. Dang, were people really that reserved and restrained at a frickin' Zappa concert? You could sense the frustration from FZ during a few moments. I had to laugh. I've seen FZ twice and used to frequent The Roxy during the late Seventies and all of the '80's and have never seen such a sedated audience. When I saw FZ the audience went nuts from start to finish.",1452124800,5,3008,4.510091743119266

7420824,5,B014RDXD18,"You are on this page because YOU like ME have been waiting to see this little film since you first dropped the needle on side one of Roxy and Elsewhere and Zappa explains he choosing his words carefully because they are making a film for television.  You and I eagerly awaited this movie, especially since we were only partially let in on the Bebop Tango gag.  Along the way I was lucky enough to see this line-up a few months after this show... April '74 I think... when Zappa and The Mothers schlepped on down to Colorado Springs after a gig in Denver the night before and en-route to Phoenix (I think).  Yes folks, you read that right, Colorado Springs, the ""little Evangelical Tehran"" of the United States of America.  In an interview that appeared in the Gazette Telegrah the next day Frank said ""you would think this town had never seen a rock-n-roll show before"".  The Colorado Springs gig was fun because there were lots of military guys in the audience and Zappa was fond of military in his audiences.  Anyway, back to this little movie.  IT IS SWELL AND WELL WORTH THE WAIT!  The liner notes include a technical but not too technical explanation as to why the synchronization of sound and picture could not be rectified until recent technology emerged and why we had to wait so darn long for this.  The problem was the % of out of synch varied widely so it was an impossible task to pull 21 hours worth of film together and have it in sync with the music.  Just look at that 93% 5 star review average.  I don't think I've ever seen a rating this high on Amazon.com for a movie or music release.  Epic.  It's as big as Billy the Mountain and cooler than Studabaker Hawk.

I am so glad that YOU and I finally get to participate fully in The Bebop Tango choreography gag. Brenda really does look like ""a professional harlot"" doesn't she?  This film was a Zappa family passion and I am also thankful that Gail got to see it through before her recent passing.  RIP Gail and thanks Zappa family for making this happen!

The song selection, while incomplete, shows the viewer exactly how highly skilled this band was, and their great sense of humor as well. The percussion section alone makes this disk a must-watch, with Frank adding his drums skills on a couple of tracks.

My only quibble with the presentation is with Frank's guitar tone. He fell in love with that Mutron pedal during those 1973 tours, employing it on every one of his solos on this DVD. The effect sometimes muffles the volume of his guitar, rendering his brilliant playing to a sameness that doesn't quite reveal the true genius of his skills. However, that won't stop me from watching this disk many more times in the years to come. It's Zappa and the M.O.I at their very best!",1449964800,,888,4.515527950310559

I memorized all the words, even the spoken bits. It is still one of my favorite Zappa records. To now get to actually see this performance after almost 40 years was a very special treat. To finally see ""Rick, Jane, and Carl"" and the rest do the be-bop tango, oh my god. To see ""Cheepnis"" and ""Penguin in Bondage""! All I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you to the Zappa family for going through all the effort to finally put this out.

As far as the music, what can I say, this is the best band Frank ever assembled, and they are awesome, beyond belief. Frank's guitar playing is great, as usual. There are a few things I miss from the album, like ""Pygmy Twilight"", ""Dummy Up"" and ""Village of the Sun"", but the rest is pretty much all there. You also get some other classic Zappa tunes like ""Cosmic Debris"", ""Inca Roads"" and ""I'm The Slime"". ""Pygmy Twilight"" is included in the extras, but it is not as good as the album version. I know Frank enhanced the album tracks with some studio overdubs, and you can tell where he did that in some parts. It's pretty interesting if you are a hardcore fan of the album.

7420853,5,B014RDXD18,"I have waited 40 years to finally see this.  The very first FZ album that I bought way back when was ""Zappa/Mothers Roxy & Elsewhere"".  Listening to Frank talk between songs, you knew it was being filmed and I figured that it would be out at my local theatre soon.  I didn't realize all of the technical problems that happened while it was being filmed.  And now, unfortunately, after FZ and his lovely wife Gail have passed away, the problems were finally overcome and we have this great concert film.  Some of the songs are different from the ones that were on the original album, as I understand FZ recorded the show over 3 nights at the Roxy and I'm guessing that Joe Travers and the Zappa family picked the best performances that were filmed as opposed to which ones were better musically.  Not that there's anything lacking in the music.  It's just that having listened to the Roxy/Elsewhere album for years, the songs as they were featured on that album are just really embedded in my head.  I'm just glad that I'm finally able to see one of FZ's best bands perform live.  Just to see Napoleon Murphy Brock, Tom & Bruce Fowler, Ralph Humphrey, Chester Thompson, George Duke, and the incredibly talented Ruth Underwood in action with FZ is my dream come true.  Also, they did use the take of ""Be-Bop Tango (Of The Old Jazzmen's Church"" that was featured on Roxy/Elsewhere.  So we finally get to see what Lana, Rick, and all of the other ""dancers"" look like.  For me, this is the BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!!",1448150400,2,1507,4.561338289962825
7420854,5,B014RDXD18,"""Roxy and Elsewhere"" has been one of my go-to Zappa albums from that great 70's era band and I've been excited about experiencing this film since around year 2000 when a 3-minute internet video made the rounds with clips from the shows promoting the 'soon-to-be' release of the legendary Roxy performances.  This promo prompted me to buy my very first DVD player in anticipation of this film.  The dvd never materialized.  Some years later the same promo trailer made its way as a bonus on the BABY SNAKES DVD but alas no full 'Roxy' video.  Many know that in the intervening years, the internet has been wailing and gnashing teeth about when this 'Holy Grail' would ever be released to the public and why hasn't it, dammit, and what's taking so long, etc.  15 years have gone by and I assumed it would never see the light of day.

Surprised when this finally surfaced and I am pleased with the results.  (It's been in the pipeline so long it's offered in an advanced medium, Blu-ray). Incredible, intimate footage of my favorite Zappa band.  Sound quality is fantastic and the song selections don't repeat other already-available videos of the era.  This presentation enhances the ""Roxy"" LP without repeating it too much, and shows off the dynamic chops of these great musicians, and without the headache-inducing 'stop-action' camera tricks Zappa employed at the time.  Some gripe about what was left out but with almost 2 hours of footage, this is a complete package and isn't tedious. It flows really well.  Even my wife, who doesn't care for Zappa, enjoyed this.  If you're a Zappa fan, if you've enjoyed ANY previous Zappa video, you should see this.  And Congratulations to the Zappa Family and ZFT for this long-awaited labor of love.",1448150400,,1742,4.805369127516778
7420855,4,B014RDXD18,"Missed out on the Zappa '70s concert phenomenon, so this was a great disc to see. Didn't really picture the Roxy to be as big as it seemed; thought it was more of a bar/band dive, with a small stage, floor, chairs and a larger drinks bar, but ROXY THE MOVIE made it seemed larger.

The music, too, weren't as 'chunky' or as polished and settled in as the later ONE SIZE FITS ALL or YCDTOSA, Vol 2 -- I liked that collection (and versions) of tunes better. But SEEING Zappa and his OSFA/Prog Jazzy band in concert action was the appeal. Especially George Duke noodling about his keyboards, Napoleon Murphy Brock moving about onstage with his horns, and above all seeing Ruth Underwood so happy and smiling, playing her marimbas and percussion-- so this was Zappa's mid-'70s band in action! FZ doing some nice guitar licks, too, and some ""lesser known"" songs given the spotlight, with room to breathe. (But... have to confess, I like that later TOKEN OF HIS EXTREME/KCET concert dvd better for all this.)

This is a brilliant opportunity to see forty years on (rather than just listen to) one of the truly great Zappa albums.  It is unadorned and refreshingly free of theatrics and special effects, letting the viewer concentrate on the extraordinary playing.  I'm at a bit of a loss to understand why the Pygmy Twilight/Dickie section was been relegated to the 'extras' section and the stupid sound effects over Zappa's opening speech annoy the crap out of me.  I'd also have loved to see a bit more of the Bolic Studios session.  But these are tiny criticisms of what is, overall, a major addition to the Zappa canon.

There were overdubs and post production on ""Roxy & Elsewhere"" that aren't present here, and there is also material on the DVD that isn't on the original record. In particular, seeing the percussion section play ""Cheepnis"" without the rest of the band is pretty impressive. Overall, the DVD gives a great sense of a relatively young band playing impossible music with a kind of a ""who says we can't do this"" sort of vibe.

7420869,5,B014RDXD18,"If Roxy & Elsehwere is any sort of indicator, the Roxy shows were among the best shows of the '73-'74 era which is many people's favorite era of Frank's shows.  So you can imagine my excitement to see this DVD, and it did not disappoint.

As it turns out, they recorded the shows with only 4 cameras, and one of them was from a distance and rarely used.  However, due to a camera malfunction, the cameras ran at incorrect speeds and until digital technology advanced towards its current state, they did not have the technology to fix it.  The end result is fairly clean, and they did a great job cleaning up the audio.

As far as the musicial content, the band is great.  These particular shows featured both Ralph Humphries and Chester Thompson on drums and they take full advantage of having two drummers in the band.  My favorite track is either RDNZL (which was a shorter, earlier version), or perhaps Big Swifty which is arguably the best performance of the song ever released.

I would say this is definitely a must for any Zappa fan whether it be a diehard or a casual fan.  My only complaint is they didn't include other songs like Montana or Village of the Sun.",1447200000,,1170,4.481132075471698
7420870,5,B014RDXD18,"Like many of you Zappa Freaks, I've been waiting to see this footage for 15 years and after years and years of posting on Zappateers and Zappa.com, the complaining, the teasers, the arguments over what to expect, so on and so forth.....it's finally here!  I needed about a week to watch the entire film.  Why?.....because it's so friggin good that I actually wanted to make it last!  I watched a song or two, ten re-watched them over and over again before going on to the next ones.
Highlights......
1)  Cheepnis Percussion:  worth the entire purchase just for this.  Amazing tightness between Ralph, Chester and Ruth.  Even the other players who are taking a break during their performance (you can actually see Fowler sitting on the stage enjoying watching them shine) seem mesmerized by what these three are doing.
2)  Frank's percussion performance during Dog/Meat.  He joins Ruth at the percussion section for some pretty impressive snare/conga/kettle-drum playing.  This really makes me appreciate the fact that Frank composed EVERYTHING.  Many people use the term ""genius"" far too often, but in the case of a true musical genius,, that's exactly what Frank was.
3)  Ralph Humphrey & Chester Thompson:  I love the duel drummer format on the Roxy & Elsewhere record, but to actually see these two guys play on and off each other is a real treat!  Ralph especially impresses me.  I've always loved his playing (especially on Apostrophe) and the guy is so underrated in the Zappa universe.  Perhaps way too much has been said of Bozzio and not enough about Humphrey.
4)  The sound!  It is incredible.  Is it true that this soundtrack is not overdubbed in any way (other than obviously remixed for a DVD release)?  The band is so unbelievably tight and awesome that it amazes me that Frank felt the need to go in after the fact and overdub a lot of parts in the studio.  If he released it exactly the way they performed in on those nights, it would be just as good as what was released 40 years ago on the R&E record!
5)  Enchindas Arf/Don't You ever Wash That Thing:  Plenty has been said over the years about these two compositions, so I won't repeat it all except to say that to finally see them performed live by the ensemble they were specifically written for is like a musical dream come true.  Prog Rock masterpieces!...(YES, they ARE Prog Rock)!!
6)  Frank's Attitude Throughout:  Frank just seems to be having a great time.  Let's face it...sometimes Frank came across a little cynical on some live performances, but here he just seems to be enjoying himself so much.  Maybe deep down he knew he had the best touring ensemble that he would ever have, playing the most intricate jazz/rock/prog/blues mishmash that he would ever compose, playing close to home in his hometown, while being professionally filmed for prosperity (oh how right/wrong he was).

The problem I have is I want to play and share this with everyone I know, but unfortunately most people just don't ""get"" Frank.  I DO and I'm proud that I do!

7420879,5,B014RDXD18,"A great concert DVD. It may not have the flair and verve of Baby Snakes, but this is a good testament of a time when actual human beings made proper rock music. A well-rehearsed band featuring some of the most musically-talented members of the seventies Mothers highlight an excellent concert. Most of this show has been heard for decades on the Roxy and Elsewhere album, but there are plenty of additions (and subtractions) to the set list to make it seem kinda new to any viewer. The video is professional, but lacking all the fades and dissolves you'd find in more modern presentations. That doesn't detract from a great concert by one of the Great American Composers of the 20th Century.",1446595200,3,691,4.7190082644628095
7420880,5,B014RDXD18,"What more can I add to what everyone else has written? It's all true. This is an incredible performance by one of Frank's greatest bands. I have been listening to the ""Roxy and Elsewhere"" album since 1977. Two years ago I saw ZPZ play the entire album live. I pre-ordered the Blu-ray two months before the release day and received it (as promised) on October 30, just in time to celebrate FZ's favorite holiday. I love it so much that I then ordered the DVD so I can share it with friends on computers and at places without Blu-ray players.

7420882,5,B014RDXD18,"Can't disagree much with everything already said, but will add my 2 cents anyway.  Don't know anything about cinematography, but I thought the camera work imparted a vividly stark realism to the show. The band's performance was as as close to perfection as humanly possible and the sound quality was so good that it's hard to believe this was recorded 42 years ago.  The comaraderie of this band was shining through with a warm quality that was palpable.  This film made me feel really good.  May be my favorite concert film ever.",1446508800,8,530,4.728260869565218
7420883,5,B014RDXD18,"Yes, yes, yes, it's so great and it's so good for you!  I have nothing to add to everyone's superlatives, and I endorse them all 100%.

I just have to ask a question, though ...  I have the bluray, and it fills the screen in the usual 16:9 modern way. But I wonder if Roxy was filmed that way 1973, as I think that would have been an uncommon format in those days.  For example, I have Baby Snakes on DVD, filmed in 1979, and it is in the typical 4:3 format of the time.

Now I am wondering if Roxy was also actually filmed in 4:3 ratio, but in order to fill the bluray screen left-to-right, the top and the bottom have been cut off.  So what we are seeing is actually incomplete, to placate people who just can't handle black sidebars.

If anybody has the DVD version, would you please comment on how the image appears?  And of course, if anybody has seen the bluray AND the DVD, I'd be very interested to know if the DVD image is more complete than the bluray.

I just want to see as much of that ""professional harlot"" as possible!  Thank you!",1446508800,6,1045,4.154228855721393

had, as noted in the title, songs from other gigs. So you need both, if you want to be complete. The songs are fine and the video has I Am The Slime. It's on other videos and the one with the Don Pardo intro and bits is the classic version. Other songs had their ultimate stage presence here on Roxy.",1446508800,,609,5.1
7420886,5,B014RDXD18,"No one on Earth creates music like Frank did. He threw all musical styles/genres into a blender and created a unique brew that has never been surpassed. The first time I heard Franks music was 1975, in my parents backyard - my neighbor had Inca Roads blasting on his stereo. At the time I was listening to prog-rock and fusion but this record grabbed my attention because it was nothing like I had I ever heard before. I asked my neighbor what he was listening to, he invited me in, and we listened to all of One Size Fits All. I could not wipe that huge grin off my face and the next day I ran out and bought it. It remains my favorite Zappa record and ranks in my all-time top five list. When I watch this performance that grin comes back and I feel like Ive transported back in time.

The band looks like they are having a blast, everyone is smiling, the musicianship is amazing and Im surprised how good the video looks for a recording made over forty years ago. If you own the Roxy & Elsewhere CD youve noticed that the Blu-ray/DVD does not contain the same songs. Two of the songs omitted from the movie are unfortunately, Village of the Sun and More Trouble Everyday, but some songs that are fresh on the video are Inca Roads, Cosmik Debris, TMershi Duween, RDNZL, Cheepnis-Percussion, Im The Slime and Big Swifty. When the end credits roll, we a treated to footage of the band rehearsing in the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen?

I have to say again this lineup of musicians is amazing. Im impressed that the dual drumming team (Chester and Ralph) can play so intense and not fall over each other. Ruth Underwood is smiling so much that its infectious. George Duke owns the keys. Tom Fowler grounds everything with killer bass playing while smoking a cigar. His brother Bruce adds some great horn playing. Napoleon is a showman and of course Frank is conducting, singing, enticing, and laying down some killer riffs proving without doubt he is one of the greatest guitarists. If you notice closely in one frame Toms cigar is there and another frame its gone  same thing with Franks cigarettes. Must be due to the fact that a lot of the film was unusable and the video was pieced together the best it could, and the end result is many hours of hard work and outstanding video editing. The liner notes explain this in detail.

When I saw Frank in concert my least favorite part of the show was audience participation. Always, some willing audience member would go on stage and it would always turn into an embarrassing spectacle. I think this was done because - Frank liked the craziness that would ensue, the audience felt like part of the show, and to give the band members a break. This spectacle is now for all to view during Be-Bop Tango.

The video runs for about 1 hour and 32 minutes. Audio options are a stereo PCM or DD mix. The DD mix states 5.1 but the rear speakers aren't used much. Both mixes sound good but I prefer the PCM mix  it has more of an open natural sound, where the DD mix sounds more detailed but louder, maybe due to added processing. Bonus features include  three additional songs, a discography, and a DVDography. Also, included is a CD of the show less five songs.

Overall this is a fantastic product and a tremendous effort by all involved. Any Zappa fan will be proud to have this in their collection and Im sure I will be watching this many many times.",1446508800,16,3393,4.461290322580645
7420887,5,B014RDXD18,"I pre-ordered this puppy and received it on Halloween, which somehow seems appropriate. It certainly was quite a treat. In my mind, the best Frank Zappa concert film released to date. The band is simply amazing, featuring some of my favorite Zappa alumnus: Keyboardist George Duke, vocalist/woodwind player Napoleon Murphy Brock, bassist Tom Fowler, trombonist Bruce Fowler, Ruth Underwood on percussion and drummers Chester Thompson and Ralph Humphrey. Boy do they kick ass. Zappa himself is in great form and seems to be totally enjoying himself. It's like stepping in a time machine and reliving those four nights 40 years ago.

Special kudos to the editing, finally syncing the audio and visuals seamlessly and providing an exceptional concert experience. No attention deficit editing here. It allows for an entirely immersive concert experience. The audio is clear and full. It's a shame it took so long, but the Blu Ray is the perfect media to experience this masterpiece.

If you're a Zappa fan, buy it now. Guaranteed you will love it. If you're not a fan, buy it now, so you can finally understand what all the hoopla is about. Without a doubt, Roxy was an amazing Halloween treat for me in 2015! And one I can keep on enjoying.",1446422400,7,1237,4.913875598086125

7420890,5,B014RDXD18,"Forty plus years.  That is how long it took to put this together.  Few things are worth that kind of wait.  This is one of them.  If you are a Zappa fan, or a rock and roll fan, or a music fan in general and hold the live concert recording as exalted above all studio creations, then let me suggest a live album for you.  ""801 Live"" is pretty much the band Roxy Music, minus its lead singer, Brian Ferry.  It is tight, it is crisp, Brian Eno and Phil Manzanera are at top form, and you end the album thinking, ""Man, that must have been a hell of a show to see.""

Speaking of Roxy Music, Frank Zappa and the Mothers' live album ""Roxy and Elsewhere"" is even more incredible. How incredible?  I will argue that it was the best live unit ever assembled, and featured the late, great gift from God herself, George Duke; the incredibly talented master of mirth and music Napoleon Murphy Brock; the charming and musically lethal Ruth Underwood; the amazing Fowler brothers: Bruce on trombone, Walt on trumpets, and Tom on bass; and an amazing drum duet in the persons of Ralph Humphries and Chester Thompson.  Album credits also include Don Preston and Jeff Simmons, who are no strangers to any Zappa-phile.  The guy with the long hair and big nose is there too, playing guitar and jumping into the percussion area when he isn't too busy sitting down.  This lineup is also featured on the ""You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore Volume 2"" which was recorded in Finland, and brings the complexity, soul, and utter joy of this unit as it slew that audience.  By the late 1970s, the Mothers' lineup had changed, but the joy of the live performance went unbridled: add Adrian Belew and Terry Bozzio to a band and you cannot lose.  And heck, I have to go back in time and mention Roy Estrada and the Flo and Eddie years - pure musical theater with a heavy emphasis on the music.  The Mothers were a band that you wanted to see - not just hear.

Let me get back to the point: I just got this DVD in the mail.  Following a Halloween viewing of the 1994 film ""Ed Wood,"" I eagerly turned the sound up on my ""entertainment system,"" and awaited the revelation of this holy relic from the Zappa vaults.  You just don't see this stuff anymore.  As a fan of the ""Dub Room Special,"" and of Bruce Bickford's stop-motion animation, I find that it distracts from what I want to see, which is the band.  Why?  Because each carefully-selected and intensively-rehearsed musician on Zappa's stage was a master of their instrument(s).  This DVD gives you the music and no filler.  Have you ever wanted to really get a good look at what two drummers look like when they play as a singular unit?  You get that.  You want to get a good gander at Ruth as she wears out marimbas and x-phones?  You get that too.  Do you miss George Duke?  You get him in his glory, doing what we all love him for.  Nappy and the Fowler Brothers?  Well, Walt isn't on this DVD but Tom and Bruce are solid and the irrepressible Mr. Brock is always a joy to watch - switching from sax to flute to microphone and back again.  You can easily see that the band was having a good time, the audience was having a good time (at least those who stood up for the Be Bop Tango), and YOU will have a good time too.  Due to a camera screw-up with the audio synchronization, it took many years to re-create this show.  The audio and video qualities display the meticulous hours it took to create this.  Buy it.  Buy two and give one to a total stranger.  Buy three and tell people that you did!  You get to watch a great band perform incredible feats - it is as visually stunning as it is musically stunning.  Forty years.  And I hear that there is a lot more film down there in the vaults - one could only imagine what is down there.",1446336000,60,3763,4.300142247510669

My expectations lowered a bit when I saw the playlist and realized it wasn't going to be the same as the album. Then, after receiving the DVD and reading the liner notes about the difficulty in syncing the video and audio and the fact it was recorded over 40 yrs ago, my expectations fell even more about how good this was really going to be. WOW, what a pleasant surprise! Whoever spent what must have been countless hours putting this together (John Albarian?) and syncing it up deserves major, major kudos! Great video in 16:9 format for todays widescreen and even with the inexpensive soundbar and subwoofer on my TV, the audio is great and the syncing is fantastic.

I saw Frank 8 times from '74-'84. 1974 my buddy yelled ""Whipping Post"" during a quiet moment in the show (Albany NY) which seemed to piss Frank off, yet he actually recorded the song a few years later (google it). Best show I saw...Hawaii, 1976 (Jan 77?...really cool story where I had to leave the show early and almost missed my midnight flight back to the mainland).

Considering this was filmed in 1973, the audio quality is great and the video quality better than many other concert films I've watched from the same era.

If you've ever seen Frank live, this is the DVD that will bring that memory back to life.
