8186094,5,B000OPPQFA,Gave us the information that we needed to help our dogs learn these skills.  Thank you so much for writing such an informative book.,1394928000,,132,4.5
8186095,5,B000OPPQFA,"I was amazed at how quickly my dog started weaving after watching the first few lessons.  She is a herding dog and loves to play the game with me.  By using the 1 idea of ""going neutral"", she went from running by the weaves to hitting them everything at home!!",1389312000,,260,4.18
8186096,5,B000OPPQFA,"Excellent step by step instruction of a good program to train your dog to do the weaves fast with a reliable entry from any angle.  Emphasis of the program is to train your to be independent.  Stresses that weave pole performance is based off of training and not handling.  I haven't finished the program so I cannot comment on if it is effective, but I get the approach.",1266796800,3,371,4.426470588235294
8186097,5,B000OPPQFA,"This DVD does a fine job offering a training system to train or improve you dog's weave pole performance. Joe uses positive methods, lots of rewards, and is effective in showing step by step how to improve speed and accuracy in the most difficult obstacle on the agility course.
Alot of time is spent on training progressively more difficult entries, and using them in a course.
If you're on the fence about this purchase, I say buy it.",1200182400,5,436,4.602564102564102
8186098,5,B000OPPQFA,"I am so impressed with the results of training w/Joe's methods as presented in this video that I'm recommending the video to all my agility friends.  After reviewing the video a couple of times we started to train from 6"" channels to closed poles with 100% success in just 2 1/2 weeks.  WCW is a systematic method for teaching your dog how to weave when his method is followed without skipping any steps.  He presents the steps in an easy to follow training plan and he explains why its important to follow his method of training.  The second part of the video takes weaving to new levels teaching your dog to performe weaves without breakouts, or missed poles and with speed and precision regardless of the entry or where the handler is or what the handler is doing.  Your dog learns to execute weaves independently of you.  This is the best agility video I've seen!",1191369600,6,867,4.561290322580645
