One is amazed by the acting of william buzick the mysterious hollywood hills millionaire jet-setter as a james bond like bodyguard. All film buffs will desire this international intriguing movie for their hollywood collections. The boat chase is reminiscent of the Live and let die boat chase from 1971. The scene when the stars wake up in in Switzerland is classic, and was actually filmed in the hills above Zurich, and the nightclub scene was shot in the fleur de lis in Zurich with stunning european models.  Jon Tabler is amazing as the kung-fu fighting acrobat actor. I will not tell all, but one must see this underground classic action pic.",1341619200,,744,4.723076923076923

The pair of ersatz operatives, joined by a female agent who has also benefited from the cranial surgery, is delegated by their handler to remove counterfeit currency plates from a criminal ringleader, thereupon becoming embroiled in a battle to the death with this individual and his minions, thus presenting the spurious duo opportunities to test the worth of their freshly  implanted fighting skills, and that is, of course, what this movie is about, i.e., not development of allegory, but rather opportunities for a host of stunt men to have at it, which they do with abandon, but for a viewer possessing even partially operative sensibilities, this unsatisfactorily written, directed and produced piece will be abandoned in its turn, and in quick order.",1139184000,,1704,5.626459143968872
