7974323,5,B000077VR1,"This is a great video IF it is used with training and not as a substitution for training.

Most training schools only meet twice a week for a few hours... even then the trainer focuses more on his advanced students and has one of his advanced students work with the newer ones.  With that in mind, being able to observe and practice the basic bumps, rolls and tie ups away from class can really help.",1297296000,,400,4.32
7974324,5,B000077VR1,"Of all the training books and videos I've bought on the subject, this is far and away the best.  It features a very young John Cena, Christopher Daniels, and Samoa Joe...this is back in the day before Samoa Joe became a complete doughboy.

Tom Howard, the narrator and instructor, is outstanding.  Excellent presentation and speaking ability.  He stresses safety, realism, and strict form.  It's a one camera production, but it's well lit, and Howard is very careful about making sure to turn the participants to face the camera so that hand positioning is clear.

It's a shame Howard did not go on to bigger roles in the big leagues...he deserved to.

Overall, if you are interested in learning pro wrestling, BUY THIS DVD!",1216684800,2,724,4.837398373983739

He wants to be a pro wrestler and this product has given him a advantage on how to make the moves before he even goes to the school he will be going to to learn what he needs to know.,1200009600,4,288,3.661290322580645
