619952,5,6303292860,"This is a very good action/comedy Julia & Nick are a great pair.
This move is about 2 reporters always trying to scoop the other one
on the headline story and end up falling in love with each other.

619953,3,6303292860,"This one was okay, but a bit too long. The funniest part is actually the scene where Nick Nolte and the boyscouts find Julie Roberts skinny dipping, giving Nick a chance to expose ""the real Julia"" to the boys. And isn't Nolte a bit old for Roberts here? Well, if you're looking for a contrived romantic comedy, look no further.",1159056000,,327,4.466666666666667

619955,4,6303292860,"This movie--and it's a movie, not a film--features contrived plot twists, an improbable romance, and predictable writing.  It's light in every way--just a little scary, just a little romantic, just a little funny.  This is not sophisticated movie-making.

However, I have moments when I want a little brain candy to keep my interest without stretching my intellect.  And in those moments, I confess, this is what I drag out.  Here's the plot: two rival newspaper reporters investigate a suspicious train crash, despise each other, are endangered, fall in love, solve the case.  I hope I didn't give too much away.  Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte don't have the snappy reparte that the screenwriters were so obviously going for, but close.  They're both great-looking and winsome enough to root for.  Predictably, Robert's character is smart and sassy, while Nolte plays a womanizing rogue.  The glowering but still incompetent bad guys threaten the daring duo without disturbing your dreams.  It's not the screwball comedy to which it's paying homage, but it's a grade-B imitation of an enjoyable genre, and sometimes that's enough.  Watch it with butter on your fingers.",1122940800,16,1169,5.192513368983957
619956,4,6303292860,"Now they have accepted women in the press, and what's more as reporters, competition among journalists is no longer what it used to be. It was natural among men. It is perverse, perverted and absolutely distorted when men and women are competing for the same scoop. That's why a simple train accident became a real plot and criminal attack that aimed at getting rid of one person and some secrets. Life would have been so much simpler without all that competition. The criminal cover-up of the criminal activity of some chemical firm and not so clear senator or should I say senatress only came out because a woman put her pretty nose in some dirty dish and some silly excited male followed the draft and came running after her. There would have been no crime if there had not been a female reporter on the beat at this very moment. That's why women should not get mixed in real business and the real world : to let things remain simple and not to criminalize simple human transactions. The film is quite schmultzy but it is kind of entertaining, though we know from the very start what is going to happen, but the rhythm is fast enough to make us believe we are really running after a gang of shady characters. We have the impression of running after some shadows like a famous little dog after his tail in some waltz of Chopin's. Except that here we don't really who is running after whose tail or whose tail is running after whom.

619957,2,6303292860,"I Love Trouble is a lightweight romantic comedy of helium-filled proportions. It is effectively a vehicle for everyone's favourite movie darling of the early 1990s, Julia Roberts, to have some fun and look lovely while getting one up on the dastardly male lead played by Nick Nolte.

Nolte plays Peter Brackett, a veteran newspaper columnist for the respected Chicago Chronicle.  Ever the ladies man, Brackett can do little wrong in the eyes of the bevy of woman he attracts, his loyal readers, and even his grumpy editor. He manages to fly by the seat of his pants with deadlines looming and get his stories filed on time, every time (even if it does mean plagiarising himself!). Having just released a novel, Brackett is about to hit the book tour circuit, and life is looking good for this charming, yet slightly sleazy bachelor. This is of course until journalistic competition, in the form of the lovely Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts), comes along with her quick wit, sharpened pencil, keen nose for a story, and obligatory short skirt.

In the end, this film runs out of steam and the ludicrous and contrived ending is probably 30 minutes too late in arriving. The actual train crash plot becomes secondary to the romantic battle between the two leads, which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter and some clichd one-liners. There are plenty of awfully large plot holes in the story, some wide enough to fit Julia Roberts' smile through sideways, and you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the contrived scenarios. If it was an effort to recapture some of the past glories from the screwball comedies of the late 1930s, it failed miserably.",1103846400,3,1692,4.909090909090909
619958,5,6303292860,"Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte play reporters working for rival newspapers, with some fun antics following.  This movie is reminiscent of a movie that Rock Hudson and Doris Day might have starred in.  It is one of my favorites.",1069545600,2,225,4.743589743589744
619959,4,6303292860,"Roberts and Nolte are rival reporters chasing after a story involving a train derailment that ultimately leads to murder.  This is a chase film set in the same vein as the legendary ""Thin Man"" series and with Roberts and Nolte it really works.  Watch for the hilarious scene where Nolte exposes the 'real' Julia to a troupe of Boy Scouts.
The transfer is not anamorphic but, having said that, there's little else wrong with it.  Color balance is strong.  Shadow delineation, while not superb, is nevertheless strong and accurate.  There are some film artifacts that float by but nothing that terribly distracts.  The Dolby Surround track, although not 5.1, has a nice spread along the three front channels of my home theater.  No extras, a disappointment, since at one time this film was slated to get a special edition treatment on laserdisc with deleted footage and added scenes.  Oh well, what's here is solid and thoroughly enjoyable.  If you like madcap adventures this one's for you.",1046476800,2,989,4.909638554216867
619960,3,6303292860,"The problem with this movie is, that the makers just could not decide what sort of movie they were making. Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a thriller? It might even be an action movie! Now one could say that I Love Trouble  offers something to any kind of audience, but the truth is that it has  become to much of a compromise. Nolte and Roberts try hard and their  performances go a long way towards saving a rather uninteresting movie, but  personally I think that their efforts should have been used on a better  script producing a better balanced story. On the whole this is a nice  movie, but not something you want to see more than one time.",951868800,8,646,4.297520661157025

620129,2,6303292860,"What woman could fall in love with a man that calls her a female dog? This movie makes real-life offensive comments seem fun and innocent, when they are actually berating and demeaning. These two characters take a lot of psychological abuse from each other. What is the theme? Two reporters that start out hating each other, then have a happy romance while they stop fighting each other in order to fight other people that happened to be murderous maniac criminals. There is a happy ending in the movie, but who could be happy after so much? I don't think its realistic enough to get into it, but maybe it can make someone else gain courage in either or both journalism and dysfunctional romantic relationships.",1456444800,,711,4.741935483870968

620169,5,6303292860,"I used to watch this movie off and on many years ago but apparently on VHS because I couldn't find it on DVD.  Of course, I don't even own a VCR anymore, so buying this on DVD online was a little more expensive than I would have originally wanted.  I was even hesitant because of some of the negative reviews.  I thought that my memory of the movie was off and that perhaps it wasn't as good as I remembered.  After buying it and watching it, though, I'm very glad I got it again.  I remembered everything pretty well, but I also liked Nick Nolte movies from this time frame.  So, this one was a good one.  I am also a Julia Roberts fan so even the moments where it might have felt like her acting was ""blah"" it was still good enough for me.

The main reason I like it, though, is that the idea of news reporters actually digging into a story because there is something being hidden is a nice thought.  I rarely see a news story these days that I feel like they have even made any effort.  They sure don't follow up with anything locally so this movie is a nice difference.  I realize there were complaints by some that there was too much going on and that the story didn't follow one thing, but that's kind of the way that movies go.  There was the main story being chased by two reporters that were rivals and had an obvious attraction.  The ""love story"" is kind of behind the scenes which is better in my opinion because it is really more of an action suspense movie anyway. The humor is OK but not horrible.  It IS a 90's movie so you can't expect it to be as good as one from nowadays!

Overall, it is entertaining so I will give it 5 stars.  The DVD worked and wasn't actually too bad of quality.  What more can you really expect from an older movie?",1436486400,7,1756,4.14792899408284

This was another one of those fake Julie Roberts movies . . . bubble gum and apple pie (which we know she is more of a curry and yoga gal).

I enjoyed Nick Nolte and Julia's deal to be like the Hardy Boys teaming up with Nancy Drew to solve the mystery.  The use of a wild goose chase is one you have to see to believe.
I was happy to find this film and for such a reasonable price, though I had one fear: that it would be like my DVD copies of ""Runaway Bride"" and ""Eight Legged Freaks""--MISSING MATERIAL FROM THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.  I know there is the line on the back of the case that says it's presented in widescreen format and that the black bars are normal; however, I still have my VHS copies of these two films, and it's like the restoring company(or companies) decided to do the work to make it visually dynamic, but then took the lazy route and added the black bars over screen material instead of actually making it widescreen!
I do hope that a company will someday restore these films to their full glory, but for now, at least the parts I can see look good. Thus the four star rating instead of five.",1403049600,8,1150,4.369158878504673

620338,4,6303292860,"These two stars make a great duo in this movie that includes intrigue, romance and laughter. It may be somewhat predictable, but there is nothing wrong with a movie ending the way you want it to.",1390953600,,195,4.444444444444445
620379,4,6303292860,"I remember he said she said, which this movie I am sure borrowed off of that idea, competitors in the news team, and trying to out scoop one another, this one leads to a killer trying to kill Nick Nolte and Julia Robert's characters, for going overboard and trying to get the story first, so they team up to survive.  He said she said, was tasteless and full of junk john hughes style, and this one is way better than that one, even if Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Perkins are two good actors, and it had one scene that is a memory in itself... She throws the coffee cup at his head.  This one had more humor, action, love, and twists.",1381276800,4,632,4.214876033057851

620382,5,6303292860,"Julia Roberts does a great job as the spunky cub reporter, Nick Nolte is perfect as the jaded and charming newspaperman and the mystery is very intriguing and still relevant. The mystery is tempered by a growing attraction between Roberts and Nolte and the film manages to maintain a very workable balance between comedy and drama. Women will love this movie but there is enough action to make this a good date night pick as well.",1373673600,,430,4.671052631578948
620383,4,6303292860,Love Julia Roberts n Nick Nolte. Couldn't believe they would be believable together but they made it work and there was never a dull moment.,1370131200,,140,4.64
620384,4,6303292860,"The main actors are not favorites of mine so it takes something for me to give four stars.  The story is as believable as a movie can be.  Thr stunt people deserve a hand or thumb up.  Photography is better than a great many movies you see today.  Very important to me the audio id very good.

If you are interested in personal opinions I will say this is not a movie I am going to sell, give away or throw away.  It will be watched at least one more time.",1367452800,,456,3.956043956043956
620385,4,6303292860,"I know this movie has not gotten the best reviews, but I have a soft spot in my heart for it. Simply speaking, I love magic, and Julia Roberts' character in this film apparently is a magical hobbyist. It's never discussed, but several plot points involve sleight of hand being displayed.
The plot is not too incredible, and it's just an enjoyable little film.",1367193600,,359,4.625
620386,5,6303292860,I saw this movie years ago and liked the pairing of Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte. The movie is funny for a suspenful type of film. I enjoy the humor and the story plot was great as well. Hence the 5 star review,1364774400,2,210,3.9069767441860463

620388,4,6303292860,"I've seen I Love Trouble several times and it never gets old. It is from the early 90s but is a story that is still entertaining today. Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts play competing reporters at different newspapers in Chicago. When a major story breaks, they both compete to scoop each other, but ultimately decide to team up when it becomes clear that their lives are endangered. Julia Roberts shines in one of her first leading roles, showing us what got her to be known as America's sweetheart. Nick Nolte is also fantastic. He is a very good actor who doesn't get many good roles anymore, because of his past. It's good to see him playing a likeable character instead of making a cameo as a psychotic drunk. I Love Trouble, and I love this movie. It's a great story with an excellent cast and thoroughly entertaining.",1361577600,,820,4.585034013605442
620429,5,6303292860,My daughter and I used to watch this movie a lot and that was a long time ago.  I really didn't think they would have it.  But I forget I was dealing with amazon. LOL!!!! Amazon carries what you can't find anywhere else.,1359936000,2,220,4.093023255813954

620434,5,6303292860,"A well written script highlighting the competive enviroment between two newspapers and their reporters. Nick Notle played a excellent part. To bad his drinking problems caught up with him.
A young Julia Roberts plays a excellent part. My family enjoyed this DVD very much and would recomend it.",1315353600,2,294,5.145833333333333

I like that I knew the two would get together, and throughly enjoyed that their getting together was so entertaining.  The story line is good as well.  All in all, one of my favorite movies of all time - one I plug in when I want to be distracted from the stresses of life.",1298937600,5,442,4.045977011494253

620438,5,6303292860,"I just couldn't take a break thru the entire movie I loved it so much. Julie just out did herself in this one, she's so charming, witty. Not to mention she is very beautiful, but I think more men than me has said that about her.

Noltie did a fine job, but without Julies part in the movie it wouldn't have had the effect it had.

Have fun with this, the part where Julie came out of the lake was great, I couldn't stop laughing. She has a gift from God for expression.",1237939200,3,469,4.032258064516129

I love the humor, the constant niggling of the characters against each other even while they fall in love with one another, and the ending has your heart going!
