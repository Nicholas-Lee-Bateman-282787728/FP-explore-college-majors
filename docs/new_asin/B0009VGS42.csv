8067557,5,B0009VGS42,"These dances are so much fun you won't want to stop.
You might even lose a few pounds.
Shawn's teaching techniques are the best.",1312848000,2,128,4.375
8067558,4,B0009VGS42,"This instructional DVD is actually incredibly helpful in trying to learn the dances.  He's slow enough for everyone to get it, but not so slow that the quick learners are ready to throw something at the screen.  My only complaint is that when you finally have the dance down and are ready for music, it's not the music you'd dance to at a country bar.  I understand this is probably due to music rights and costs, but it does make for a totally different experience once you try it out in public.",1247529600,4,496,4.369565217391305
8067559,5,B0009VGS42,"This is my 4th Shawn Trautman DVD.  And it's as easy as the first one. It's all broken down into easy steps.  When he first does the dance to show it to you, you wonder how can I do that?  But when he starts to teach it, there is no problem putting it all together step by step.  I'm looking forward to the Smokin' DVD's.  Anyone should be able to do line dance with his lessons....",1220659200,5,382,3.973684210526316
8067560,5,B0009VGS42,Loved it!!  It was so clear and concise.  You could see every step.  The line dance was easier to learn because of the video.,1193961600,4,125,4.125
8067561,4,B0009VGS42,"I would give this dvd 5 stars because Shawn goes through each dance in such detail so you have no problem learning.  The only thing is, when I go out to do line dancing, the dances were totally different!! I later came to find out that every ""country"" club has different dances.. even if it's a few steps that are changed up.",1188518400,5,325,4.241935483870968
8067562,5,B0009VGS42,"A great introduction to line dancing.  Shawn makes learning so easy, I can't wait to move on to another DVD in the series.",1165017600,2,122,4.304347826086956
8067563,5,B0009VGS42,"Just as the first volume, this volume shows you the step-by-step dance moves at different angles at a very good pace. This will add to and build on the dances in your dance repertoire. My children even danced with me and were keeping up and having a great old time! The instructor doesn't leave you hanging and explains everything clearly. What's also nice, once you've mastered the basics, he adds special moves at the end that can make you look like you've being doing it forever and that gives you the freedom to improvise some things on your own. I really recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to learn how to country line dance. They really do these dances out on the dance floor, so it's stuff you can use and apply in real life!",1138492800,17,737,4.426470588235294
8067564,5,B0009VGS42,"I own many dance instuction tapes and DVD's from other instructors, but they're all collecting dust. They move too fast, causing you to replay and replay and replay and replay. Not, Shawn Trautman's. I have 4 of his now. This is the best instuctor out there. Anyone, and I mean anyone can learn to dance with his DVD's.",1132272000,12,319,4.517241379310345
