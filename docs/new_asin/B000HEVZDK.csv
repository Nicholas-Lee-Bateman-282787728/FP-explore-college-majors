2636043,3,B000HEVZDK,"This serialized filmed adventure, combining live actors with marionettes, delighted Baby Boomers for years, and this collection of 15 random episodes should be cause for rejoicing in nostalgia-hungry circles. Not that this is a perfect showcase for this material. For one thing, the episodes are not presented in chronological order; the very last installment (titled ""Dynamite"") is fifth on the roster, followed by ten previous episodes. Would it have been all that difficult to put them in proper sequence?

The episodes (16mm prints from an old syndication package) have not been digitally restored, although that really doesn't matter to me. In fact, they look just like I remember them: in black-and-white, a bit grainy, and showing occasional signs of wear. So these technical shortcomings only serve to enhance the nostalgic experience of watching this series again.

DIVER DAN won't mean a thing to anyone who didn't grow up watching these adventures as part of their local TV kids-show programming. However, for those of us who were enthralled by the fish marionettes -- and the flesh-and-blood Miss Minerva -- this disc is a bona fide blast from the past.",1219622400,7,1165,5.191489361702128
2636044,5,B000HEVZDK,I used to watch Diver Dan as a kid in the 1960's. It was great to be able to see it on DVD and share with other kids.,1215388800,,117,3.2142857142857144
2636045,2,B000HEVZDK,"Yikes, This show gave me the willies when I was a little kid and it is even worse now. It looks cheap, dark, and oppressive. The puppet fish used to give me nightmares with their flapping mouths.",1207267200,,195,4.297297297297297
2636046,5,B000HEVZDK,"Nostalgia at its best!!! I remember this show in New York City and it was one of the featured items on the Officer Joe Bolton show, along with the Three Stooges!  It was awesome then and it is awesome seeing this show now on DVD.  It does not get any better than this!",1191974400,4,268,4.037735849056604
2636047,3,B000HEVZDK,"I was glad to order this DVD, having awaited the arrival of DIVER DAN on home video for years -- but enjoyable though it was watching this DVD, this isn't really the proper release of DIVER DAN on digital video disc. The Alpha DVD is apparently unlicensed, and while it's good to have the 15 shows included here, this is going to look a lot better when and if the actual owners of the series ever get an edition of their own out. For starters, they're in black-and-white (which, yes, I know is how all of us saw the show in 1960-66 or whenever we caught it), but the series was actually show in full color, and should be presented that way. But worse is the fact that not only are the story-lines incomplete, because the makers didn't have complete story-arcs among some of the 15 shows here, but they're also out of sequence, so that the first installment of what was the last story in the series comes at the very end of the disc, over an hour after the material that is supposed to follow it. The transfers are also flawed in places -- for the price it's okay, but I'll gladly buy this material again, to get this series done properly if the owners of the series ever give me the opportunity.",1173484800,33,1195,4.315555555555555
2636048,5,B000HEVZDK,"This is an exceptional example of children's television from the late fifties and early sixties. It appears to have been made from the original film master. Image and sound are crystal clear. The DVD contains fifteen thoroughly delightful episodes of DIVER DAN.

I was amazed with several aspects of the show. The writing is some of the sharpest you'll find in children's television. Baron Barracuda is consistently laugh-out-loud funny. (Baron Barracuda was the pattern for Sesame Street's Count von Count.) Each fish character has a clear purpose and each episode is a morality tale with lessons to be learned for young and old alike. Finally, the movement of the marionette fish is magical. No strings are visible and their movements really mirror their moods!

For those of you who are old enough to remember the original, this will quickly become one of your favorite DVDs. (Several friends and colleagues have already requested their own copies.) For those of you who never had the pleasure of seeing the original, DIVER DAN is one of the best examples of children's television from the Black and White era. Its storylines are as relevant today as they were then. Before you know it, you'll be introducing all your friends to the most evil fish ever to stalk the ocean seas... the one DIVER DAN ominously refers to as... ""The Baron"".",1161993600,36,1339,4.920353982300885

8139158,2,B000HEVZDK,"The description of this item needs to plainly state how many episodes are included on the disc, and that they are not in order as to make any sense of continuity or a complete story.
Misleading and disappointing.
Not worth it.",1480377600,,226,4.536585365853658
8139159,3,B000HEVZDK,"This is one boring black and white DVD. I bought this out of curiosity after reading the reviews about it. It ranks as quite silly and dull. I never knew such a kid's classic existed until I found it on Amazon. It was just plain silly and unbelievable. In this volume Diver Dan was not allowed to meet the mermaid, because Neptune rules wouldn't allow it. How ridiculous is that.  Anyway, I'm glad I didn't spend too much on this stupid little DVD. If anyone is interested in purchasing this dumb kid's show buy it used.",1422057600,,520,4.416666666666667

8139161,5,B000HEVZDK,"Brilliantly conceived children's show, photographed through an aquarium window to simulate undersea activity with fish marionettes, an intrepid diver, and a beautiful and wise mermaid (swoon). It is over 50 years old now, so a few politically incorrect instances occur, but they do not detract or spoil the overall charm of this series.",1390262400,,336,5.3584905660377355
8139162,5,B000HEVZDK,"I loved watching this live action TV series when I was around 10 years old, it was a filler on WPIXTV in between other TV shows. I often wished it had been a thirty minute show. Because of the way the series was shown on WPIXTV the plots were hard to follow as they were usually continued, so the DVD brought an end to that issue!
Besides all that I had a huge crush on Diver Dan, and when I would get under my mother's nerves she would tell me,""Go, go watch ""Diaper Dan,""""...",1371772800,,476,4.074468085106383
8139163,5,B000HEVZDK,"A number of reviewers have written that although they enjoyed the selection of various episodes of DIVER DAN on this DVD, they still yearn for the ENTIRE show--thus revealing themselves to be true connoisseurs of cinema, with the most elegant, sophisticated, and exquisite taste!

The complete series is available on DVD over at Nostalgia Family Video. (Even though the main format in which they sell DIVER DAN is VHS, nevertheless, as explained on their home page, you can instead get DIVER DAN--and whatever other titles of theirs you want--on a ""No Frills"" DVD that they will make for you.)

I got the VHS tapes of DIVER DAN from them a few years ago and they look and sound GREAT! Thrilling to hear the theme song again:

* Opening theme

Below in the deep there's adventure and danger;
That's where you'll find Diver Dan!
The sights that he sees are surprising and stranger
Than ever you'll see on the land!

* Closing theme

He moves among creatures
Of frightening features:
Flashing teeth, slashing jaws,
Flapping fins, snapping claws!
He protects and he saves
His friends under the waves;
That's where you'll find Diver Dan!

--written, performed, and sung by the show's sound engineer, Jack Sky.

A great, delightful, wise, and unforgettable show.  For children of all ages--including this 55-year-old reviewer!",1279324800,2,1320,4.9908675799086755

8139165,5,B000HEVZDK,"This DVD brought back so many memories!  The special effects are hokey, but are so ""of the era"" that it makes it even more charming.
