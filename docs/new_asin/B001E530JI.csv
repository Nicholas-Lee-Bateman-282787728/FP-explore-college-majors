3545708,5,B001E530JI,This is a great old show.  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be released.  These shows were written at a time when they really wanted to entertain you. They have simple but good plots and William Conrad is a likable character.  I hope that they will release the rest of the seasons soon.,1231891200,8,297,4.175438596491228
3545709,5,B001E530JI,I enjoy all the old TV shows.  They were great then and are great now.  I look forward to them being released.  Cannon is right there with them.,1231372800,6,144,4.071428571428571
3545710,5,B001E530JI,"I had been waiting for years for the release of Cannon on dvd.  William Conrad is an affable, yet tough connoisseur / detective.  In the series, he is always underestimated by the villains.  They inevitably learn, too late, that, while, short in stature and stout in figure, he will work through the case and come out on top.  By the way, it is great that he got this gig, because, after playing a terrific Matt Dillon on the radio series for many years, he was rejected for the television role (Gunsmoke) because of his appearance.  Anyway, great, well crafted detective series that will be worth the price.",1231286400,12,608,4.644859813084112
3545711,5,B001E530JI,"William Conrad had been around for quite some time before he became best known for being private eye Frank Cannon in the Quinn Martin television series, ""Cannon."" He had been an actor, producer, and director for movies and television shows, and was best known for three programs that used his voice only - being the voice of Matt Dillon on the radio version of ""Gunsmoke,"" the narrator of the classic cartoon series ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" and the narrator of another Quinn Martin series, ""The Fugitive.""

When Martin looked for someone to play an overweight, but very capable private eye in Cannon, he could have picked a better actor than Conrad. Even though he was best known for his vocal talents, Conrad made Cannon a flesh and blood character - charming, humorous, compassionate, and on occasion, violent. For once, Conrad had a chance to show as much talent on camera as he had off camera. And with Martin's penchant for creating solid detective dramas, Cannon became a very popular series.

Conrad would have other notable gigs after Cannon, the emcee of CBS' Thanksgiving Day festivities, the DA in ""Jake and the Fatman,"" and for too brief a time, ""Nero Wolfe,"" but he will always be remembered at the portly detective who drove a Mark IV, had a car phone (very rare at the time), and who knew as much about cooking as he did the law.",1219449600,3,1361,4.714285714285714
3545712,5,B001E530JI,Alright the 2nd half of the first season. Really looking forward to this release as well as the rest of the series. My only complaint with the first release is that CBS did not give the master tapes any remastering and it's kinda blurry. All the other CBS releases are perfect picture but not the Season 1 Vol 1. Very upset about that.,1219363200,4,335,4.333333333333333

3545718,4,B001E530JI,"Watching old TV series is such a relief from today's TV filth. Cannon was a favorite of mine when it first came on; but, some of these episodes do have a touch of B-Movie about them.",1422057600,,182,4.083333333333333

3545720,5,B001E530JI,"I bought this two-volume set of Cannon as a gift for a relative.  He loves the series and I do as well, but I've not bought these DVDs  for myself because Amazon's product information does not indicate that the DVDs are close-captioning or subtitled.  I am hearing impaired and I need the captioning in order to follow the dialogue.  However, I am happy to say that the person who received my gift informs me that these two volumes do contain close captioning for the hearing impaired.
I tried to update Amazon's product information to include this, but I'm not sure my addition will be accepted.  I really wish Amazon would take the presence or absence of captioning much more seriously. Many customers  must make a decision on whether to purchase a DVD on the basis of the description and if it is wrong or incomplete, it is the customer who must suffer!",1419638400,,856,4.598684210526316
3545721,4,B001E530JI,"I bought this series simply for nostalgia's sake. I like William Conrad as an actor. I remembered having seen this series when it first aired and enjoyed the shows at the time. Purely for nostalgia, I wanted to see them again.

Three things struck me as I watched the series that I didn't even notice at the time:  1) all the cars in the show are Fords, 2) there were no seat belts, 3) no one locked their cars. Motels have evolved since this series.

Conrad is a likeable overweight private detective who takes on clients he believes are innocent. He is the protector of the underdog and women. The stories are still interesting and believable. Setting are, of course, period. A nice glimpse into Southern California history and values. Emphasis is on story line and character rather than special effects. Car chases are in most episodes.

For anyone wanting to dip into TV nostalgia, this series is a must.",1415059200,,908,4.65625

3545725,5,B001E530JI,"Jake & the Fatman is wonderfully entertaining and well worth the $.  It is P.I. excitement and humor at its' best.  But I can't understand how the ""bad"" guys can miss their shots at the fatman.  What a large target!

Please give us the rest of the series!",1396310400,,255,4.25
3545726,5,B001E530JI,"I only started watching Cannon because I saw him on the original
pilot of Barney Jones! My dad was a big Cannon fan and after the
first show I loved it! Like Jones Cannon wasn't like your typical
young good looking PI and that's what made those shows work!
Yeah they were funny at times but more like real life! Not every guy
or policeman or PI are Burt Reynolds! I hate that they divide the
seasons up like they did with Streets of San Francisco! what a
bunch of money grubbing Hollyweirdos! and where's the rest
of the Barnaby Jones series? Anyway Cannon is a great 70's
detective show that gets overlooked but it's a must for any fan

3545729,5,B001E530JI,Buy this if you want to happily revisit some fine old detective action. A great period series. Kids get interested in the older vehicles and 70's habitats found in this show.,1388534400,,174,4.645161290322581

3545732,5,B001E530JI,The first season of this show had more action and excitement compared to the other seasons of this show. Martin Sheen was in a couple of episodes and he was very good.,1364947200,,167,4.25

3545737,5,B001E530JI,"Really enjoying seeing these old shows again.  My grandfather and I used to watch Cannon together and when I saw the first volume of Season 1 become available I put it in my wishlist and my son bought it for me for Christmas last year. I then ordered the 2nd volume a month or so later.

My only complaint is that I wish the studios would put ALL of Season One in ONE set vs. breaking them into 2 volumes -- just because NOW we only get 10-12 episodes of a show in one entire season doesn't mean we've ""forgotten"" the good old days of 30-35 episodes in a season....would rather pay a bit more to get full seasons, than have to order 2 different sets (and it takes up more space on the DVD shelf).",1321228800,,696,4.110294117647059
3545738,5,B001E530JI,"This was the best ever it brought back times when tv was great. Good clean tv when you knew the good guy was going to win. Not like the shows of today where you know the plot already. Old tv had great old actors who had movie, and acting training not like now. I buy these old shows because I grew up on them my parents loved old tv very much. My parents are gone but I remember them though old tv shows. And it makes me smile when I think back of them and their old tv shows. Thanks for the memories.",1320278400,3,501,3.8737864077669903

3545740,5,B001E530JI,"I was a year old when this show aired the first time, so all I was ever told was how much I loved it as a child.

So I decided to try it to see if it held up, and I was not disappointed. It may not be the greatest thing ever, but it was still a lot of fun.",1302134400,,256,3.2666666666666666
3545741,4,B001E530JI,"The heading gives practically the whole review. Cannon is a very good,and different sort of tv action show. Frank Cannon is always poking fun of his own weight, but when the chips are down he mixes it up with the bad guys like his athletic tough guys brethren. The picture and sound quality is excellent and I like the way it is packaged as well. My only complaint I have is the same I have with to many series releases. To squeeze every dime out of the buyers they can, they have split the season in half so you will spend twice as much to get the whole season. I only bought the half seasons because I shopped around and bought it cheap after it had been on the market a while.",1300492800,,679,4.151515151515151
3545742,5,B001E530JI,This is a great DVD.  Cannon is one of those series that can be watched over and over again.  I just wish that the seller was able to locate Season One so that I could purchase it.,1291507200,,180,3.8378378378378377
3545743,4,B001E530JI,"I don't know why everyone makes a big deal about Frank Cannon's weight. Sure back in the day he might have been considered heavy, but in modern times he'd blend in just fine. Seriously, have you been to Milwaukee lately? How about Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Chicago or anywhere they sell ""real""(as in cooked with lard) grits? This poor guy was a drop in the fry grease bucket compared to what we got walking around out there nowadays. There should be more Frank Cannon spin-offs on TV now than there are for CSI or Law & Orders!

I liked old Frank. I especially liked how, to compensate for the fact that he was never gonna chase anyone on foot, the writers would add in a chase scene where a criminal on foot is chased down by Cannon in his huge monster car. Then instead of tackling the bad guy he smacks him with the car door, or on a good night, actually runs the bad guy down! WHEEEEOOO! That was fun! And remember how they had to imply the love scenes with the ladies, cuz nobody wanted to see THAT, and even though it was only hinted at the actresses still looked really uncomfortable. It's hard to believe that when he shot this show he was a mere 22 years old.

I really appreciated this show because at the time I was a bit of a stout lad myself and it was nice to see someone like me up there on the small screen. Frank never let his weight get in his way (except when he was looking for his weener) and that was something I admired. Where are the heroic, smart chubbies of today? We don't have any. Instead one of our most popular TV shows is about real life fatties who need to make a public spectacle of themselves to lose weight! They sit there and bawl for an hour while an angry she-male yells at them.

We need more shows like this one. Well written dramas, whether they are detective, doctor, lawyer or anything else are like the canaries in the mine shaft. Once they start disappearing the industry is in big trouble.",1288828800,3,1937,4.315934065934066
3545744,4,B001E530JI,"Oh how I enjoyed the Quinn Martin produced shows of the sixties and seventies. Cannon was no exception. William Conrad, before Cannon, was a CBS employee for many years. The voice of Matt Dillon on the radio version of Gunsmoke, and narrator of ""The Fugitive,"" CBS promised Conrad his own series, on TV. Conrad was a big man, and hollywood, with it's obsession with thin and beautiful, stepped out of it's obsession with Cannon. Season 2 was fun to watch. Some of the era's best stars were on the show. The Lincoln Mk 4 Cannon drove, and his mobile car phone were fun to watch as well. This show was nominated for emmys, and was no slouch.

The only things that would make it a little better, would be commentary by say, some guest stars or someone significantly connected with the show. I know this is difficult, since most of them have passed on. William Conrad died in 1994. I also wish that CBS would release the series by seasons rather than volumes. The quality of the DVDs is good, but not outstanding. No HD here, but good. I wish somehow we could get other Quinn Martin shows released to DVD, like Twelve O'Clock High, and the FBI.",1278115200,13,1140,4.480769230769231
3545745,4,B001E530JI,"This show is a great example of 1070's popular culture.  From the far-out plots to the funky hairstyles and clothes to the big Detroit cars with velour upholstery, this series can't be beat.  And William Conrad as Frank Cannon is icing on the cake!  He definitely doesn't fit the normal image of a suave, handsome private eye like Mannix.  Just a plump guy who's on top of everything and is quite athletic to boot.  You will enjoy every minute of these well-produced DVD's.",1277683200,,473,4.650602409638554

3545747,4,B001E530JI,"This is one of the best series of the '70s. My only complaint is Paramount didn't remaster the episodes.

3545748,3,B001E530JI,"In this 1971-76 crime drama, William Conrad (Marshall Matt Dillon on ""Gunsmoke"" and narrator for TV's ""The Fugitive"" and ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"") plays moustache, rotund, pipe smoking private investigator Frank Cannon. The 13 episodes in this 4 disc set include ""To Kill a Guinea Pig"" with Vera Miles as a doctor being intimidated into accepting a prison inmate she formerly rejected for a medical research experiment. The intimidation includes the horrifying discovery the villains have killed a monkey by hanging. The gruesome scene is shown in silhouette. John Rubinstein, son of Classical concert pianist/composer Arthur Rubinstein, plays a cult leader in ""A Deadly Quiet Town"". Martin Sheen is a disable ex-cop in ""Devil's Playground"", a role he later reprises in ""A Flight of Hawks"". Frank Cannon was not only a detective, he was also a food connoisseur. In ""The Island Caper"", Cannon uses an electric fan to aid in preparing Peking duck. 1970's TV detective buffs should fare quite well with this DVD set.",1242950400,3,1009,5.158536585365853

3545750,3,B001E530JI,"William Conrad, got his first lead in a television series in 1971, as an ex-LA cop turned private eye, Frank Cannon.  At the time, police and crime dramas were big, and were about to explode in popularity.  Following in the wake of late 60's programs like Dragnet, Mannix, Colombo, The Mod Squad, Adam-12, and Ironside (just to name a few), Cannon was part of the early wave of a genre that would soon flood the airwaves in the 70's.  A Quinn-Martin Production, the program has the familiar basic packaging of the company's previous prime time successes, The Fugitive, The FBI, and The Invaders.

Bill Conrad was a big man, an obvious fact that the series' writers made a point of emphasis, and humor, for the character Frank Cannon.  They put Conrad's obesity out in the open, with frequent references his size and weight, or being on a diet.  Cannon blames himself for his weight problem, and being something of a gourmet cook, doesn't make things any easier.  It all seems unkind, but this was a different era, and Bill Conrad appears to have taken it all in stride.  He may not have had the ideal body type, but Conrad was certainly up to the physical demands of being the lead in an action series.  There are plenty of fights, chases, shootouts, and car crashes, and Mr. Conrad proves to be very light on his feet, and quite a scrapper, with the muscle power to fling attackers around with ease.

Among the highlights in the second half of the first season, are `A Flight of Hawks"", where Cannon is hired by an insurance company to look into the death of a man killed in a car wreck.  The investigation leads to a group of mercenaries.  Cannon is quite impressive, assembling and firing a machine gun, then challenging a P51 Mustang fighter plane.  It's not realistic, but it sure is fun.  In `The Torch', Cannon investigates a fire that claims a life.  Anthony Zerbe impresses playing a high tech expert in arson, who gets tangled up in murder.  `The Island Caper' provides a change of pace, as Cannon is sent to a tropical island to check into the security of a bank.  In `Flight Plan', Cannon is hired by a devious and ruthless criminal (Cesare Danova), who wants to disappear, and nearly falls victim to his own ingenuity.

Smart, capable, tough as iron, and big of heart, Frank Cannon is a true pro, who operates with a unique flair.  Conrad brings humanity and warmth to the character, which is a plus, as the writing is generally adequate, rather than outstanding, and Conrad's ability to win the audience over with charm and humor helps make some of the weaker stories still pretty enjoyable.

William Conrad, who had a long career in films and television as an actor, director, and producer, got his start in radio.  With a powerful and distinctive voice, he was Marshall Matt Dillon on the long running radio serial version of Gunsmoke, and appeared in thousands of other radio dramas.  He also did narration for numerous films, and television productions like The Fugitive, as well as voice work for cartoons like Rocky and Bullwinkle.  He was posthumously elected to the Radio Hall of Fame, in 1997.  Besides Cannon, Conrad also starred in the television series Nero Wolf, and Jake and the Fat Man.  This very talented man, passed away in 1994 at the age of 73.",1239408000,9,3278,4.649305555555555
