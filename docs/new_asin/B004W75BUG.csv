4485959,4,B004W75BUG,"It's a shame this 3rd season is considered too over the top to be shown on cable TV; after seeing the Comedy Central Roasts and ""South Park"", I'd concluded there wasn't much that was too much for cable. After watching the first installment of this new season, I just don't understand why Adult Swim doesn't air it.

It's the same old loveable Shin in this third season. There's a bit more of the dark ""bunny"" aspect included in this latest installment, but that aspect is easily skipped by those who find it disturbing. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the new season and hope there are many more to come. The gang's all here from Ench to the teachers to the neighbors and the Shin clan of oddball characters. I really like and recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first two seasons. Shin's an acquired taste and not for everyone, but once a fan, always a fan!",1316822400,,860,4.477707006369426
4485960,3,B004W75BUG,"I've always liked Shin Chan, both the Funimation re-dub for Adult Swim, and the original manga. Even though they made some significant changes to the original Japanese version, it's still very funny and watchable (if not for kids). I was thrilled when I saw Season 3 part 1 up for release, and ordered it immediately.
However, I was rather disappointed when I watched it. While previous seasons and episodes were much more balanced in their use of varying settings/jokes and used the very adult and dark humor sparingly, the new season features a whole lot of sex jokes and some quite dark humor in just about every episode. One thing that made the first two series as fun as they were was a sense of balance in the humor. The new series really lacks this, and the show suffers as a result.
Another small annoyance of mine is the rampant political ""humor"" in many of the episodes. While the character of Georgie has always been used to poke fun at conservatives/rich people, since the debut of the new series I noticed a major upswing in random potshots at supposed conservative viewpoints/references to people not liking the president as being racist, etc., and it's rather annoying. While I am admittedly a conservative myself, and not terribly appreciative of the political humor, I'm more annoyed that the writers felt the need to include so much of it. Several sketches featuring Georgie seem to be entirely based on it, to the point where I will skip them when rewatching. Again, I see a lack of balance as a problem here; while the first two seasons used the political humor as a way to develop Georgie's character or to use an occasional reference to recent political events, they seem to have gone overboard with the new season. Rather than being used as an occasional joke to add to the humor of the overall sketch, the writers seem to have devolved into launching gratuitous brickbats at any and everything conservative in response to various political events of the last two years. I don't think it adds to the humor in the slightest, and I hope they tone it down a bit for the next part of season 3.
Overall: I think the new season is okay, and features much of the humor that we've come to know and love from Shin Chan, but I agree with Joe and Brian about the direction in which the new season is going. Here's hoping part 2 is a little more enjoyable!",1312416000,2,2367,4.598108747044917
4485961,5,B004W75BUG,"I will give Funimation/Amazon any amount of money for this series to continue! I thought I was at a lost when this stopped airing and no more dvds were being produced, but fate told me to randomly Google search Shin Chan 4 days ago. I Found this. I love this dvd! That's it.",1312329600,3,274,4.188679245283019
4485962,4,B004W75BUG,"It has been two long years since we last saw Shin Chan, but now he is back and the hilarious ""mature-themed"" anime series is more outrageous, more risque and more offensive than ever!

In America, we have Bart Simpson. In Japan, they have Crayon Shin-Chan.

The similarities, people will complain about the series and its theme but while Shin-Chan of Japan is more troublesome in a Bart Simpson kind of way, the US adaptation of ""Shin-Chan"" takes it a step further by making it more mature-themed similar to ""South Park"".  With the storyline somewhat rewritten for Americans, because the series is not being aired on television any longer, the writers can go much further for its mature content.

But make no doubt about it, while children in Japan watch ""Crayon Shin Chan"", the American version is definitely not for children!

Whether the storyline features Shin Chan showing off his butt cheeks, the children's mothers having a sucking contest on a bottle to the teachers at his school always talking and wanting to have sex, to Shin's father being told by a co-worker to have a three-way between his wife and her sister, suffice to say, ""Shin-Chan"", especially with this latest season 3, part 1 is much bolder and possibly offensive to some people.  Otherwise, if you enjoy series such as ""South Park"" and are up to mature humor featuring kids, then this series is definitely for you.

So, what is ""Shin-Chan""?

""Crayon Shin-Chan"" is a popular manga and anime TV series that has been airing on TV Asahi since April 1992 and has been a ongoing manga series since 1990.

I've been a fan of the series as far back as 1993 and have always been in awe of the anime series, merchandise, video games because despite the show focusing on a troublesome child, unlike ""The Simpsons"", Crayon Shin-Chan is quite blunt about mature situations, enjoying pulling down his shorts and cracking jokes but being the epitome of a child that goes way overboard and his parents, friends and people in school try to cope.

Also, his parents Hiro and Mitzi are not the average parents. Having to deal with being a low income family, they are just as cynical as Shin. And his friends and their parents are just as dysfunctional.

Having been wanting this series to come out in the US (note: it was shown in Hawaii via English subtitles back in the mid-90's) over a decade ago, I have to admit my surprise during a late Saturday night and discovering the series known as ""Shin Chan"" on the Cartoon Network.

Since this series has been ongoing since the early 90's, FUNimation Entertainment decided to change a few things for the American release. The order of the episodes are not featured in the original Japanese order and the biggest change is that the writing is more adult-themed and focuses on American pop culture with the jokes featured in the series. So, there will be references to pop culture news and celebrities of the time. The characters have also been slightly changed in order to give them a more comedic approach.

With the release of the DVD series, ""Crayon Shin Chan"" has been uncensored and is definitely targeted for mature audiences. Each episode of the series contain three short episodes that vary in length and are often a continuing of a previous story or a totally different story overall.

""Shin Chan - Season 3, Part 1' continues episodes 53 through 65. The following episodes are included on two DVD's (spoiler-less summaries).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Shin Chan"" is featured in standard definition (4:3) and is an anime that has its own distinct style of character design and animation. Simple colors, line drawings with no major shading. Because animators have to crank out many episodes of ""Shin Chan"" daily, there is no time to focus on detail and shading. So, ""Shin Chan"" is not exactly a series to look for animation quality. But picture quality is clear and although not vibrant in colors, what makes Shin chan work is its storyline and the ability to use simplified drawings and color pallet to bring out the humor of the series.

As for the audio, audio is primarily in English and featured in Dolby Digital Stereo. And I have to give Laura Bailey a thumbs up for capturing Shin's voice. Akiko Yajima has created a distinct voice of Shin Chan in Japan and Laura Bailey does a great job in capturing that voice for the FUNimation Entertainment dub. In fact, I'm quite impressed with every voice talent on the series.

It's important to note that because ""Shin Chan"" is a series with a storyline and characters that have been heavily modified for American viewing, there would be no way to include the original Japanese soundtrack since the storyline and characters would be completely different.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Shin Chan Season 3, Part 1' features trailers for each of the four volumes released on DVD thus far from FUNimation Entertainment plus FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have always been quite biased towards ""Crayon Shin Chan"" and have always wanted the series to get picked up and somehow get broadcast in the US. Of course, only Hawaii has been fortunate to get episodes with English subtitles shown and for us in the mainland, we had Japanese video rentals as an alternative at that time. I've been a big fan of the series throughout the years that my friends would be shocked about the series and instantly became fans.

I would go on to import the video games, the manga and even had Shin displayed on the back of my old racing car during my college years. So, suffice to say that when ""Shin Chan"" was shown on the Cartoon Network, I was amazed and enthusiastic. Granted, I know that there were changes made to the series and that this would not be an exact translation of the Japanese series but with over 15 years of episodes shown in Japan already, it would be too difficult for any anime company to pick up the series and show any backstory to the characters.

So, what FUNimation Entertainment, the ADR team and the writers had to come up with in making episodes from later ""Crayon Shin Chan"" episodes and creating a storyline and new storylines for the various characters is quite a challenge but they succeeded. Of course, the changes to the series makes ""Shin Chan"" more adult-themed and because it's no longer on television, the writers get a bit more leeway by making more sexual references but also including some other jokes that may be deemed very offensive.

But the series is now along the lines of the humor you would see on ""South Park"" and there is no doubt that with ""Shin Chan - Season 3, Part 1', it's much more bolder than the previous episodes.

The bottom line is that ""Shin Chan"" is an animated series in the US that is targeted for adults. Trust me, because this series features children, this series can be as equally obscene as ""South Park"" and you definitely don't want your curious children near the room.  Some may mistake this as the same episodes from Japan ala ""Crayon Shin Chan"" but it's not.  The English dialogue has changed to become much more mature.

While the first two seasons aired on the Cartoon Network, some may wonder if they need to go back and watch the previous volumes and the answer is not really.

In Japan, the series has been going on since 1992 and while the series has stopped airing as of 2010 due to the death of series creator Yoshito Usui.  The US adaptation didn't start from the beginning of the Shin-Chan run (this is when Shin was much younger and didn't have a sister).  If anything, the only reference from the past episode is how Shin accidentally blew up their old home but other than that, you can actually start with season 3 and still understand what is going on in the episodes.  If anything, a lot of these episodes are stand-alone and can be watched in a different order.

But otherwise, if you do enjoy ""Shin Chan - Season 3, Part 1', then definitely go back and purchase the previous four volumes on DVD.

Overall, I admit to be biased towards ""Crayon Shin Chan"" and since I do review ""South Park"" and other mature-themed animated series, I'm actually quite open to the humor and comedy of ""Shin Chan"" and for me, its amusing to see how creative the American writers have done with the US adaptation thus far!  Especially to see how raunchy and how over-the-top they can get.  I will say that there were some moments in this volume, I felt like ""Oh crap!  I can't believe they did that..."".  But once again, I'm open to it, so I'm not easily offended.

Once again, this is not an animated series for children despite it showcasing children.  Nor is it the exact same series of what is aired in Japan.  But if you are looking for a hilarious, outrageous and even offensive animated series and are open to that type of comedy, you can't go wrong with ""Shin Chan"".",1312243200,4,13740,4.608302507192766

**For your kind consideration**

  I have been a HUGE fan of Shin Chan since episode one, and I just want to share a quick nugget about myself. I am one dedicated fan. The kind of guy who said, ""Well, Weezer (the Green Album) is good, if you like Weezer."" And I stand by that brand of loyalty today. So, needless to say I bought Shin Chan sea. 3 pt. 1 'sight unseen'. And as long as you're dubbing it, I plan to keep buying. However, as a super happy fun time loyal fan I must be candid in my review. So here goes. Cons - What's up with all the generally GRATUATIOUS perverstion and psychotic killer tendancy in almost every episode? Who decided that the core characters of the show, Shin, Georgie, Maso, Boo, and Penny should take a total back seat to so many random 'extras' who all seem to share the same sexually deviant or homicidal personality.. Its like Miss Polly took extra strength nympho pills, and over 2 years managed to infect 3/4 of the entire cast. Even Mitzi to an extent has traded her ball-busting cynicism that I've grown to love for wonton tripe. Seriously, so far, the series is playing out more like Mystery Science Theater 3000, where a small group of wiseguys are merely improvising adolescent quips over a classic piece of Japanese family sitcom. Also, who thought it was a good idea to turn Nanako into a gold-digging star-humper? Or, that Penny's father's abuse holds some newfound sentimental value to her?? It was hard enough to watch some of the Penny-based episodes of season 1, and 2, but those in season 3 are boarderline unwatchable. I understand that there's no chance of this show ending up on TV in season 3, but that's no excuse to compromise quality family satire for shock's sake..  just cause you can. You have a responsibility to those of us who first fell in love with the high caliber whitty comedy of Shin, his family, friends, and the quirky, but (what's the antonym for perversely obnoxious) citizens of Kaskube.. Whew.. Thanks for listening. On the pros side, there are still plenty of LOL moments that give me hope for future installments. But, please give us some more Shin, Georgie, Maso, Boo, and Pennie. Mister K, Principal Ench, Yonro, and Action Bastard!! Thank you, SO MUCH for your time, and efforts to bring unique entertainment to the United States.

Super Shin Fan,
--Joe",1312156800,13,2356,4.6514423076923075
4485964,4,B004W75BUG,"NOT a show for kids. This is adult humor.
Okay guys, I LOVE Shin-chan, I looooove the voice actors, and I, in general, love Funimation. So I got the new Shin DVD set and preordered the second one. I watched this set and nearly every line is about sex, at least with some characters. I thought all of the filthy jokes from the first 2 seasons were hilarious and so are most of the ones I've seen here. It's just nearly EVERY new character is acting like a hipster horndog and eventually it looses a small bit of it's charm. Season 3 doesn't have quite as much diversity as the first 2 seasons which gave us more adorable situational humor allowing the viewer time to dig into the characters and their little ""twisted world"" right before the hard jokes pop out and shock us. One big dark or dirty joke after the next without pause can make the viewer feel numb. It almost transforms the characters more and more into, well.. psychos trying their best to be hip (think Quentin Tarantino), instead of the oddball overwhelmed maniacs we all adore. Things do feel more balanced after you adjust a little, but never as balanced as seasons 1&2. It't all shock and no innocence and the (relative) innocence is what seperates it from its competition (ie. South Park and Family Guy). Honestly, most of what I find overdone were the new characters and all of the teachers. I do realize it's just a continuation or evolution of the brilliant work Funimation did with the first two seasons. For me, at least, it's a bit to far of an evolution. Still enjoyable and funny, they're just not quite the same characters you remember.

What doesn't change much are many of the central cast: Shin, Hiro, Mitzi, Hima, Georgie, Boo, and Ai for example. So there's tons of fun to be had as always. The voice acting... amazing as ever.

Summary: If you thought the first two seasons went way to far and were insultingly crazy, or even traumatizing, steer clear. If you can't get enough sharp no-holds-barred, break every rule comedy in your life then look no further. Dedicated fans of the show will consider this a no brainer. It gets half a star removed for not quite having the congruity I was expecting personally and another half star for lack of real bonus features like commentaries, so 8/10. I love love love Shin so I'll probably keep buying and watching and I hope my review was helpful.",1312156800,8,2371,4.563380281690141

8444757,2,B004W75BUG,"I am a hardcore Shin Chan fan. This review isn't easy to write because I incredibly loved the last two seasons!

This first part for the third season is more ""modern"" than anything from the last two seasons. This third season is apparently taking place two years after the last season which makes sense because that's about the time between the dubbing of the second season and this one. Within those two years, it's like a jumbled mess. Basically, things like Georgie's family losing their money and Shin and Paris had dated. You're expected to just go with whatever the show tells you when they bring up all this new information with very little background story, especially with the story aout Georgie's family and the loss of their assets.
Now, when I said this season is more ""modern"", I meant that there are a LOT of modern references in it. To me, those references really kill the show. It's almost as if this season is relying on connecting to the fans more? I don't watch the show to connect to it; that's basically the exact opposite of why I watch it.

Another aspect that really hurts this season would be the lack of good material for the episodes. Honestly, no Shin Chan fan can deny that this season is far more offensive and shocking than the last two seasons. For example, there's an episode where Shin is supporting Hitler, etc. That episode is actually one of the better ones from the first part of the third season, I found that most of the episodes from the last two seasons were hilarious, and I only dislked a few. Now, into the thrd season, it's the other way around. Most of the episodes aren't as entertaining as before and there are only a select few that I enjoy. I feel as though the material is a bit too ""cheesy"" and expected. Everything in Shin Chan should be unexpected and take you aback whether it's due to the crude language, character personalities, etc. On an ending note, there isn't much of Ai to be seen in this season, yet. I love Ai, and it's a bit saddening to not see her appear regularly like she did in the last two seasons.

Some of the good aspects of the show would be the increased volume of offensive language, etc. That's something that really makes Shin Chan different from other anime. Also, the graphics seem to have improved, as well. Better graphics is necessary when an anime has mediocre drawing such as Shin Chan's. There are also new characters, too. The ""Flamer"" and Bitzi are nice additions to the show. Each have different personalities and a bit of the episodes focus on building their character.

I really, really wish I could have wrote a better review for this, but Funimation definitely went too overboard on things that should be kept to a minimum.
Well, this is the last season that Funmation will be dubbing, and honestly, I feel like I was ripped-off. I'm glad I didn't pay much for this, because if I were not a hardcore fan, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money.

I'll still purchase the second part of the third season only because I'm a hardcore fan. I'm not really holding out any hope for it, though. For the last season that Funimation dubbed, they should have made it 100x better than the last two seasons, yet it's glorious flame managed to die out within a short period of time.",1366502400,2,3266,4.5288135593220336
