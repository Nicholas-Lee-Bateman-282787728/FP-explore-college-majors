3498849,1,B001BSBBGW,"After having seen the movie ""Ed Wood"" - I had to find out for myself if ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" really was the worse film of all time.  I was truly not disappointed.  A ten-year-old in his backyard garage could have tuned out a better flik.  I wonder if Wood really knew he was turning out such a clunker, and was just putting us all on?

3498850,5,B001BSBBGW,"I am a total nut for these old movies so I'm probably not going to be very unbiased.  This one is truly a fun movie with some fair (for the time it was made) special effects.  I liked it and am glad I have it in my collection but for the ""never-happy"" ones out there, this one isn't for you.  It doesn't compete with modern day special effects or even plot but for B movie addicts it's a must have.",1236038400,,398,3.95
3498851,5,B001BSBBGW,"As with Ray Harryhausen,I'm sure Ed would have loved to film in color if he could have dug up the financing. The colorization is good quality,and a half second blooper seems to almost be tied in perfectly with Gregory Walcotts line: If a little green man jumps out at me,I'm going to.....",1235433600,,288,4.5576923076923075
3498852,5,B001BSBBGW,"Ed Wood's legendary stinker should require no introduction.  After all, what other movie can be considered among cinema's most important by virtue of being so irredeemably terrible?  Starring archival footage of a post-mortem Bela Lugosi, unedited single-take scenes, live script-reading and the worst special effects ever conceived by man (eat your heart out, Mr. Lucas)--all of these elements conspire to ensure that you've seen better quality videos produced on certain well-known websites.  Yet all of these ridiculous elements conspire to create one of the funniest movies of all time, even if it is unintentionally so.

Now Legend Films has arrived on the scene to breathe new life into this ""masterpiece"" through its advanced colorization process.  Honestly, while watching this DVD you will not be able to tell that the color was added decades after the fact.  Legend has had its ups and downs in terms of color saturation and believable palate, but they clearly brought their best effort to Plan 9--it looks as though it was filmed yesterday.  Also included on the DVD is the original black and white version, but even as a fan of the classics, I strongly urge you to consider watching the color version first--it is simply that much better.

The special features really put this DVD over the top, though.  Included (as is the case with many Legend Films DVDs) is an audio commentary in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 vein by the show's star, Mike Nelson.  As you can imagine, Mike avails himself of the lush material presented by Plan 9, to hilarious result.  Even people who have never seen Mystery Science Theater before will undoubtedly find this commentary hilarious, particularly if they are movie fans.  Also worth a mention is a short video of Director Ed Wood doing a vintage striptease (Ed, it appears, was as interesting in life as his movies might suggest) and Mike Nelson's comedic explanation of Plans 1 through 8 (for the curious).",1227571200,8,1957,5.006172839506172

3498858,4,B001BSBBGW,"Ed Wood is far from the worst director in history, nor is Plan 9 the worst film ever made. Harry and Michael Medved gave Eddie and his movie those titles in their book, The Golden Turkey Awards. By doing so they helped embed Plan 9 and Eddie into the collective consciousness, so in that regard, they did Eddie a favor.

But after viewing countless obscure and popular films for a few decades now, I can state with 100% certainty, Harry and Michael Medved were very wrong about Ed Wood.

Don't believe me? Then watch something like Curse of Bigfoot (1975) or Frankenstein Island (1981) and get back to me. The fact that Plan 9 is the only film in which Maila Nurmi appeared in her Vampira costume also secures it's special place in movie history.

NOW ABOUT THE PLAN 9 DVD:

The B&W version looks much better than the colorized version. The colorization is okay (though not very believable), but it softens the image and reduces the contrast. The dvd menu music is very annoying. Why didn't Legend use music from the actual movie?

The ""deleted scenes"" are not actually deleted scenes. They are actual clips from the movie that Legend has added goofy sound effects and cheap animations to in a failed attempt to be funny. Mike Nelson's commentary/riff is interesting because it's basically a draft of the final Plan 9 Rifftrax riff he did later with Bill and Kevin. Mike always sounds so lonely doing riffs by himself.

The other extra is a list of ""Plans 1 through 8"" narrated by Mike Nelson. It's done in a cheap Flash animation style that hasn't aged well, and I hate to say it, but it's not Mike Nelson's best writing; it just falls flat.

I also question the cover design. Why is Bunny Breckinridge looming large dead center between Dudley Manlove and Joanna Lee? It should have been Tor Johnson in the center, sandwiched between Bela Lugosi and Vampira!

But, considering the low price, this is still a good deal and I still recommend it. I hope Legend releases an updated version with new extras and a better cover.",1467849600,3,2022,4.612813370473537
3498859,4,B001BSBBGW,"I've been a fan of Ed Wood for years.  The most entertaining of his movies is Plan 9.  It is pretty cheesy of course, and having it in color doesn't diminish it's cheesiness.  In fact, I think it highlights it.  But cheesiness is an endearing quality in my book.  The colorized version also has lots of bonus features, including a commentary by Mike ""MST3K"" Nelson.  But the biggest bonus?  Whether intentional or not (and I prefer to think it was unintentional, like most of Ed Wood's movie faux pas), the company misspelled ""Restored"" on the DVD cover.

3498875,1,B001BSBBGW,"I could not agree more with the general consensus that ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is in fact the worst movie ever made.  The acting is beyond horrible.  The script is absolutely terrible.  None of the dialogue makes any sense!  To make a long story short, it's just plain awful.  However I am not saying don't see it!  Buy or rent ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" as soon as you can.  You will be laughing so hard you will probably pass out.  I have seen it dozens of times and I am always laughing myself silly.

In this classic of the wrong kind, two aliens named Eros and Tanna attempt to conquer Earth by ressurecting recently dead humans and using them as an army to overtake the planet.  Their reason for doing so is to prevent us from developing a weapon called the Solaranite.  The Solaranite can actually explode sunlight and destroy the entire universe.  All seems lost for humanity but never fear!  Our heroes Jeff Trent (Gregory Walcott), Army Colonel Edwards (Tom Keene) and Police Lieutenant Harper (Duke Moore) will face the evil aliens and save the day.

Despite the fact that it was not exactly what writer and director Edward D. Wood, Jr. had in mind, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" will have you laughing all the way from start to finish.  Criswell's opening narration is so badly written you can't help but laugh. There are more laughs through out from the acting as I mentioned earlier to the poorly constructed sets (Check out that airplane cockpit set!) and the god awful editing, you will be entertained (As well as very confused, especially when Eros tries to explain how the Solaranite works.) from start to finish.

This particular DVD is very well made.  The colorization is done very well.  Just another reason why every Ed Wood fan should have this DVD.  I actually have two different DVDs of this movie.  The other one I own, which just has the movie in black and white, has the very well made documentary ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood:  The Plan 9 Companion"". (It is included on later issues of the movie with the title ""The Ed Wood Story:  The Plan 9 Companion"".)  The documentary is a little long, but it's still quite good.  It features interviews with many of the surviving cast and crew of ""Plan 9"" and has some very good stock footage of Wood himself.  It's unfortunate that the documentary was not included on this particular issue.

In closing it should be noted that Ed Wood was a complete no talent.  The man could not write nor could he direct.  In the popular 1980 book ""The Golden Turkey Awards"" authors Harry and Michael Medved named Wood ""The Worst Director of All Time"" and rightfully so.  Yet despite that, Wood deserves to be remembered as well as respected.  As bad as he was as a director and as terrible as his movies are, he managed to get the movies made.  That in an of itself is quite an accomplishment.  He was not a bad person at all.  He loved movies and the art of filmmaking.  You can't knock a guy for that!",1345766400,7,2958,4.508474576271187
3498876,5,B001BSBBGW,"In my personal opinion this is not the worst Ed Wood movie. It's the best he have done. You should see the others movies. If Ed Wood had dedicated to be comedic director, It could have been the greater comedic director of all time. Anyway, I love everything about this DVD, It's so much fun with all the special feature are awesome and hilariously and the color are amazing. Great job for Legendary Films.",1311379200,,405,4.486486486486487
3498877,5,B001BSBBGW,"I honestly don't see how this could be rated the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time (behind ""Troll 2"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" the Worst Film in History). Besides the ""cheap for it's time"" special effects, I don't think this movie is quite bad, at all. In fact, I liked it. Although I DO think that part of the reason it's rated so badly is because this movie was actually intended to be serious, although it seems completely, 100% legitimately like satire or comedy. I'm willing to guess that's probably why it's called such a ""bad"" movie. But aside from that, if you go into this with an open mind and don't expect bourgeois film-critic-calibur greatness, you will be entertained.

I also wasn't aware there were two versions of this DVD, but I apparently have the Image Entertainment one, and that is the right DVD.",1298246400,,818,4.5646258503401365
3498878,3,B001BSBBGW,"Things may be flying around on the end of string, but who cares? The
techo-nuts out there wouldn't know how to make a good movie today if
they didn't have all the computers and special effects to do the work
for them. Back in those days the film and TV industry used what they
had: nothing. I could name 20 movies made today that, if it wasn't for
special effects and computer graphics, they would be just bits of film
on the editors' floor.

It is a typical movie where aliens meet humans, and the arrogant humans
who think they are superior, try to shoot them down because they are
suddenly scared of the unknown: aliens.

The back-drop for the outer space scenes looked a bit silly and I'm sure
they could have painted it much better. Some of the night scenes looked
to me as daylight, but I'm not sure as I had my hand over my eyes. If I
didn't know better I would have thought that the aliens were more human
than me as I've been told many times that I live on another planet.

I like inspector Clay as he is a 200 year younger than ""The Addams Family""
version of uncle Fester while he was still on steroids, but his grave that
the policeman got into didn't look like any grave I've seen. It was more
like plaster cast to me.

The uniforms the aliens wore were more like a ""come as you please"" day at
the office, but everyone forgot. The purple satin top over pants are real
stylish (get some imagination for heaven's sake).

This movie is no different from a lot of films, TV and live shows from the
'50s and '60s. The sets were put together with cardboard, glue and chewing
gum. Amateurish at best, but what wasn't back then.

There are a lot worse out there than this one and I have reviewed one of
them (not this one). There are a million and one nit-picking faults with
this film, but if anyone did that they would have to condemn most of the
movies ever made, as there are lots just as bad or worse.

I am glad that there were plans 1-8 in the ""Special Features"" as it gave me
a standard for Plan 9, and I'm glad they all failed.

I gave the movie 5 stars because it is just another film from the 1950s and
came nowhere near the title of ""the worst film of all time"", and hope a lot
of people enjoy it. As with everything that is at the forefront of a
developing industry, there is the beginning, the middle, and what I call
the techno-advance. In films it is great graphics, million dollar crappy
acting, and over-the-top special effects. Give me the old stuff any day.",1297555200,2,2481,4.230443974630021

3498882,3,B001BSBBGW,"Well, at least I finally saw this ""famous"" movie. It took me a long time but so many people have said ""it was so bad that it was good"" I finally gave it a shot.

Well, I agree ""Plan 9"" is bad,  but I'm sure there are worse ones out there. Really! I've seen worse (usually the ""B"" sci-fi movies of the '50s, too!)

I loved the first third of this film. I laughed many times at the hokey flying saucers, the walking ""dead"" and the corny dialog. I thought, ""Wow, this was a bad (meaning good) as advertised,"" but then I found the film starting to lag at the 35-40-minute mark and recovered a little bit in the end, but not enough to make me want to watch this again. It got too talking and too preachy. Holy cow, this movie is nothing but preaching for everyone to take ""flying saucers"" seriously. Then we got more preaching at the end about the usual how- violent-mankind-is"" blah, blah, blah. The writers here obviously took themselves too seriously. They should have just kept it as sci-fi/horror flick without all the heavy-handed preaching.

8284707,3,B001BSBBGW,"While I was cleaning out my attic recently I found an old paperback compilation titled ""Son of Famous Monsters,"" a softbound volume containing a selection of articles from editor Forrest J Ackermans late and lamented ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" magazine.  Famous Monsters was a monthly magazine I read as a child.

One of the articles in the dusty old book was a feature about the movie ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""  The article was published at around the time of the movies original 1959 release, or shortly afterward.

It was fascinating to see what the movies publicity coverage was like while ""Plan 9"" was still contemporary, and even more fascinating to see the movie treated with a modicum of respect. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" sure hasn't gotten much respect over the years. Generally its referred to as the worst movie ever made...when its referred to at all.  It must be tough to live with a designation like that.

But speaking for myself, I changed my opinion of ""Plan 9"" a while ago, under some unusual circumstances. It was then I understood exactly why the plan worked.

Four or five years ago I was out of town on a trip, at a hotel in a city far away from home. One night I was feeling pretty lonely and isolated, unable to sleep although it was very late at night. So I took a walk to the lobby of the hotel to get myself a Coke and a smoke. Remember, this was the middle of the night. Passing by one of the convention rooms off the main lobby, I heard laughter, cheers and some applause. I wondered what kind of meeting or reception could possibly be taking place at close to three in the morning.

When I asked at the registration desk about the commotion, the night manager told me a film convention was going on at the hotel that weekend, and that the late show had just started in that particular room.

Somehow the phrase the late, late show struck a pleasant note in my memory. With 24-hour television programming, little room exists anymore for a late, late show. At one time almost every city with a television station had one.

The Late, Late Show came on at least once a week, usually on Saturday nights, and would feature an old moviegenerally of the lousy varietyinterrupted frequently by commercial advertisements for businesses both local and national.

Sams Furniture of Phillipsburg Pee-Yay had a great commercial on Altoonas Late, Late Show on WFBG, politically incorrect as all get out when you think about it. featuring three mustachioed cardboard puppets, dressed as Mexicans--complete with sombreros--playing guitars and singing the Sams Furniture Store jingle to the tune of La Campasita.  I still sometimes catch myself whistling that little tune and thinking of those puppets.

And Ed Eisenhower, the host of KDKA in Pittsburghs version of the Late, Late Show, would shamelessly hawk the Sealy mattresses available at the Kelly and Cohens Department Store. At the end of the show, hed kick his bedroom slippers off so hard that the slippers would fly up into the air over his head. Then hed jump onto the Sealy bed and pretend to go to sleep.

The Late, Late Show would usually precede a pre-recorded prayersometimes called Sermonetteto conclude that days television broadcast. The playing of The National Anthem would follow a television test pattern and then the hiss of dead air would continue until early morning. It was like your televisions way of putting on pajamas, saying goodnight and climbing into bed.

Anyway, that night in the hotel, I wandered over to the convention room at the hotel that night and listened in for a moment, then opened the door and stepped inside. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I realized that the room was large and filled with rows and rows of collapsible chairs. Mesmerized people filled most of these chairs, and seemed were enraptured by watching a scratchy 16mm print of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""

Some people standing near the door looked like they were in charge of things, and I asked them if it would be okay for me to stick around and watch the movie for a couple of minutes. They shrugged and invited me to stay and watch the whole thing if I liked. So I found an empty chair and watched ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" for the umpteenth time, with a room full of strangers in a hotel in a city far away from home. But in a way, I suddenly felt closer to home than Id felt in years.

Sometimes I think were very spoiled as a society by being given too many choices. With non-stop, around-the-clock cable broadcasts, movie channels and pay television stations, having only one entertainment choice is rare.  Often the choice was a scratchy, faded print of a lousy old movie that nobody really wanted to see, even when it first premiered at the local Bijou.

Early in my life existed a time when any movie on television after one oclock in the morning was a good movie, because it meant there was somebody else in the dark and silent night world who also awake and unable to sleep.  And the commercials were sometimes the icing on the cake.

Finding that room full of people in the middle of the night watching ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" reminded me how much I miss that. Knowing that there are other lonely souls out there gives us a sad sense of hope and longing that only people who are alone in the middle of the night can feel. Meeting some of those people, and sharing some time in their company, was something extra.

Books have been written about Edward D. Wood, Jr., and how awful, and unpolished and awkward, his movies are.  Its true that Plan 9 is a terrible movie, but many terrible movies exist...and more are released every week of the year.  And yes, ""Plan 9"" is ineptly made,  But Ive thought about it many times since that night and have realized that the only real difference in quality and style between ""Plan 9"" and, say, a movie like DeMilles 1956 version of ""The Ten Commandments""the movie ABC Television still shows America each and every Easteris that one of the movies had a tiny budget and no major stars and the other had the backing of a major studio and a cast of expensive megawatt Hollywood luminaries, both behind and in front of the camera.

But ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has something that most movies, including many of the most expensive and profitable movies ever produced, do not have, never had, and never will have: ""Plan 9"" has a spirit and a heart thats full of enthusiasm, joy and happiness.

Obviously made by people who love movies, seeing ""Plan 9,"" once or again, is like going back to your old high school and checking out that years class play after having seen all the plays on Broadway, or like watching a group of small children staging a pageant, earnest and solemn in their efforts to appear grown-up.

And since seeing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" that night in a room full of strangers, I think of it as a comfort movie.  I sit down and watch it again from time to time.

I watch it every time I feel alone, or left out or forgotten...or when Im just feeling a need for a boost of enthusiasm and joy.",1503792000,,7041,4.578361177406523

Plan 9 is an operating system that is designed to replace UNIX. Oh yeah It is also a movie.

""Future Events Such As These Will Affect You In The Future!""

Due to their inability to make friendly contact with the earth government the aliens on the first 8 plans they must resort to Plan nine. This basically consists of reanimating the dead to become their army of conquest. Will the plan work?

Due to low budget and the unfortunate early demise of Bela, Ed Woods has to resort to his Plan 9. You will notice that a lot of the scenes are done with curtains. Does his plan work?

This would be a one star movie but because this is a must see to be culturally literate I gave it three stars.",1497571200,,944,4.433526011560693
8284710,5,B001BSBBGW,"Now I understand why this Ed Wood movie is a cult classic!  The props (flying saucers that look like frisbees), Bela Lugosi prowling around in his Dracula cape, and generally horrible script executed by wooden actors, all add up to a screamingly funny experience.  This is a trip.",1493596800,,280,4.8125
