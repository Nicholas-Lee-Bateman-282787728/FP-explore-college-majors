8619374,5,B00FY83CBW,"Buoy begins with a series of beautifully constructed and cropped images of landscape and interior which capture a real sense of place and establish the pacing of this film.  It's a bold concept (only one character on screen; a single telephone call) which sounds as if it would be difficult to make interesting.  Doughton's script and the incredibly, skillful acting on the part of Tina Holmes both contribute to the gripping and moving impact the film has on the viewer. Ms. Holmes seems completely natural and believable as the character she plays.",1394582400,,550,4.967391304347826
8619375,5,B00FY83CBW,An honest and compelling story. The clean and elegant cinematography were wonderful. Beautifully acted. An unusual film and one worth watching.,1389744000,,143,5.857142857142857
8619376,5,B00FY83CBW,Steve Doughton's first feature film shows an assured emotional hand and strong directorial vision. The award winning screenplay comes to life through the nuanced performances of it's two actors. Yes - two - and only one of them is on screen. The other is her brother on the telephone. A committed approach to the cinematography makes more of less. Allowing Tina Holmes to inhabit formally composed frames while avoiding unnecessary camera movement or cutting drew me in to the subtleties of her character's relationship with her estranged brother portrayed by Matthew Del Negro. Mr. Doughton has made a brave film that trusts the intelligence of his audience and rewards them for their attention. Bravo!,1383955200,,703,5.175438596491228
8619377,5,B00FY83CBW,"Buoy is the kind of film that envelopes you.
From the opening credits to the moment the ""action"" begins, you are poised, through Doughton's careful composition and thoughtful editing, for the shifting expectations that question an uncertain dialogue between a traveller's tales and ""ordinary"" bourgeois life.  Add the emotional complications of an estranged sybling's rivalry to Italo Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"" and you only begin to get the idea.  Buoy surrounds you with its only setting, an upper-middle class home in the suburban Northwest, then takes you inside a single conversation between a brother and his sister.  Intimacy, expectations, life choices and desire are all in flux as the two try to understand each other.  Buoy reveals an almost pedestrian psychedelia as the conversation fractures and pauses, then mutates and swells. It is a brilliant script and a remarkable film.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1383868800,,930,5.386206896551724
8619378,5,B00FY83CBW,"Excellent indie! Sort of a NW ""My Dinner with Andre."" The film is about one phone call between two estranged people that will hold you throughout the film. Buoy relies on a solid screenplay and clever dialogue, without it there's no way the film could have held my interest. The cinematography is well executed and helps the film move along without feeling forced by the director. It's great to see an indie film succeed in a format and style few big budget films do anymore. Highly recommended viewing.",1383523200,,503,4.7272727272727275
