Except for the cleavage, the film wasn't worth watching. Why do you knock someone out first to get them to stop screaming if the object is to kill them anyway?

The acting was not good. The script was bad as was the dialouge. They couldn't match gunfire sound and muzzle flames. I didn't even like their fonts. Poor production all around. Not worth a rental view.

8318304,1,B001LJMAK2,"The acting is so bad in this movie, calling it ""B-rate"" would be a flat out lie.  Makes Dolph Lundgren look Oscar worthy.",1268524800,,121,4.260869565217392
8318305,3,B001LJMAK2,"The men and women who set out to protect and serve find they must often deceive to solve the case. Following the riveting hunt of a helpless murder witness, the deadly war between the Special Forces and the drug lords rages on. Amidst this ongoing battle, murders are committed, hits are made, and the chances of survival shrink minute by minute.

I must say, this is a pretty good action flick! Between the drug lords, battles, murders, and deadly war, let's just say this film is full of suspense. I was impressed with the quality of the film as well. There are some well known actors in the film too. I think it is definitely worth checking out on a rainy day.",1265673600,4,663,4.434426229508197
8318306,3,B001LJMAK2,"Reading the write up on this movie, I thought I would by it for some cheap thrills. Thought I would get some undercover good guys getting in lots of well choreographed fights with the bad guys and that would be it. This was more. It was filled with enough action. The chief bad guy over acted a bit, but did a good job. There was a nice comical moment when they killed the guy who could not ""hold his water"". Being a helpless romantic, I wish the romance between Vic and the dealers girlfriend had been explored a little bit further. The two big goons for the drug dealer could have seen more action, so we could have yearned for them getting their just rewards in the end, but since we did not, they were just two big goons who got theirs in the end. This was well worth what I paid for it. Just wanted something to fill the time. Instead I got a pretty decent action flick.  I only wish this could be a series.",1236384000,4,912,4.1525423728813555
