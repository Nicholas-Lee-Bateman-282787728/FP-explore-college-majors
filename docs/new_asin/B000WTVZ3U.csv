2991720,5,B000WTVZ3U,"I did not know what to expect from this movie, but the movie description sounded very interesting.  I was attracted to it because it seemed like a ""triumph through adversity"" true story.  I really liked this movie a lot.  It was very well documented and a compelling story of large family farm that went through crisis and wound up re-inventing itself through the persistant vision of farmer John.  I really like how John follows his heart in farming and expressing his artistic endeavors.  There is no BS with this man.  His relationship with his mom was very touching too.  I was so inspired by this movie as to start to be more active in organic farming in my own yard.  I do not have a farm, but I do have a yard and access to good composting materials.  I also am looking into finding community supported agriculture (CSA) farms locally.  I was very interested in the biodynamic organic farming methods that John uses and is in Eliot Coleman's books.  I really enjoyed the musical pieces in the film by Leslie Littlefield too.  My son really loved the ""Bug Song"".  Overall it is very worthwhile watch that will inspire you to: Follow your dreams and heart, be persistant, deliver valuable goods and services which people will flock to, farm your large or small plot organically, and support locally grown organic produce.  If this was the intent, it was certainly worked on me.",1229644800,3,1382,4.680497925311204

We loved the opening where John takes a bite out of a clump of  dirt...this is something my husband does!  He tells everyone how much he loves dirt!  I hope to add it to your school library....so much here in this film about rural life,communities,families, what it means to be different,and the same...the filmmaker must have had tons of material to work with.  As my husband said, ""Thank goodness John's mother bought that movie camera."" Good films about contemporary rural life, such as this one, are rare.",1204070400,8,660,4.655172413793103
2991723,4,B000WTVZ3U,"The BS factor seems to be relatively low. Very little pretense, from about as far as you can get from either coast. I'm not a farmer, but I lived close to this area & I can relate to the characters in this dying segment of the United States. John Peterson is an original, born & breed on a midwest farm. A farmer was all he ever wanted to be . It was his destiny & inheritance. Success, failure, success, failure, success. That is also an American story. But failure for the American farmer today is  inevitable. The farm John grew up on was a success. It fact it was easier to be a farmer post World War II than the mid 1960's & even today. John felt the guilt as his family's farm slipped slowly out of his grasp. He attended Beloit College in Wisconsin, basically because it was the school closest to the farm. People were drawn to him because of his natural goodness, forthrightness & nonconfrmist attitudes. He drew the counter-culture crowd, they used to be called hippies, to his farm in sort of a loose commune-type atmosphere. The economy of the whole country was entering a recession & farmers started losing their land, including John. Because he was a controversial character, he was a easy target to blame for the bad econmomic times. This is one man's life but it also an important documentary on the disappearence in America of the family farm from degradation of the land through chemical pesticides, fertilizers, overuse & urbanization. John, in another trait that is so very American was able to reinvent himself & yet able to stay on the land. It is that oppotunity for second & even third chances that has drawn people fron all over the world for over two hundred years. I did not know about this movie until I saw a blurb on the cover of the dvd in a rental store that indicated the Al Gore has viewed it. Some excellent extras, including two music videos fron John's girlfriend, Lesley Littlefield, that I watched twice. Really, a worthwhile effort.",1202860800,27,1971,4.567796610169491
2991724,5,B000WTVZ3U,"How often do we come across entertaining movies from a Midwestern America point-of-view, and more specifically a farmer's point-of-view?  I can't say that I ever have before. This movie engages people on so many levels! Adults can relate to the wonderful family histories of people and property, the way one's occupation can break your heart, the need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off afterwards, and the powerful pain that made-up gossip can inflict.  I especially appreciated the film maker's gifts for making the audience see and respect people who can seem invisible in our society.  For example, an aging mom or the Mexican-American worker with a gazillion handy skills.  My church paired this movie with Barbara Kingsolver's ""Animal, Vegetable, Miracle"" for a thought-provoking focus on the food we eat and how we obtain it.",1202601600,12,839,5.147058823529412
2991725,4,B000WTVZ3U,"I didn't know what to expect from `The Real Dirt on Farmer John'.  Knowing that America was once known as ""the bread basket of the world,"" I knew this documentary would have some import, but I never realized that it would be this engaging.

You get the idea you've stumbled into a different story when John Peterson, the focal point and protagonist of this little movie, is performing his work on farm machinery looking like Elton John if he had become a farmer.  Flamboyantly dressed, we see a man with a colorful personality and an even more colorful past.

Since The Depression John's Scandinavian family obtained a farm in North Central Illinois where corn and hogs kept their existence simple, yet plentiful.  After his father died when he was fairly young, John had to take over the farm with his mother's support and his uncle's inspiration.  Determined, John like many other of his neighbors, fell upon hard times.  Remembering Willie Nelson's initiatives with ""Farm Aid"" during the eighties, the film reminded me so much of those news reports that showed the farmer's existence being put to the way side.  Like many effective documentaries, this film has home movies showing actual auctions as many American farmers lost their livelihood to real estate developers.  The shift in America's agriculture is entirely accessible in this fun and informative little DVD.

Education was John's ace in the hole.  He went to Beloit Community College during the hippie era and was able to recruit several friends who wanted the communal lifestyle.  Artsy met earthy, and John offered a virtual paradise.  Yet, differences often create suspicion, and John's neighbors started rumors that devastated him personally and financially.  People started to scapegoat John for misfortunes that occurred and labeled him a Satanic cult member.  At the head of the opposition was Sheriff Don, who is often interviewed and makes the story less remote and more real.

While John is resourceful, what actually transpires and how he copes is enough to see it all for yourselves.  'The Real Dirt on Farmer John' is an enjoyable experience that yields a large crop of interest.

(I have two things in common with John Peterson.  One is that we both bear the same name, and the other is that we both grew up eighty miles apart from one another in Illinois.)",1200787200,23,2336,4.943589743589744

This film is life-affirming in so many different ways, and such a visual and emotional treat. It speaks to many cultural and ethical issues, including of course to the issue of corporate vesrsus local, organic farming, our flagrant use of pesticides and herbicides, and oil-based nitrogen, etc.

It also speaks to the value of human artistic endeavors, to the unfortunate conservatism and closed-mindedness of many traditional farming communities, to the value of human diversity, and much more.

For instance, the 2 people featured in the trailer as attempting to start a CSA... what you see in the trailer is their only appearance in the film. They don't show up anymore.

It is a story about a farmer who experiences tremendous adversity, and it is an inspiring story and you do feel for the fellow. But it is not a farm film at all. The end is a glorification of the CSA model and what can happen when community comes together, but there is nothing specific or egaging about the farming system itself.

Not a terrible film (though I personally didn't enjoy it much), but don't be fooled by the trailer, it isn't a film about farming. It is about 1 man's experience as a farmer/seeker/adventurer.",1421712000,,838,4.58

2991736,3,B000WTVZ3U,"The title of this one really does say it all, it's about Farmer John not about farming. We watched this because it showed up in the list of farm and food related ""More Like This"" recommendations. It claims to chronicle that farm crisis and while it is certainly related, this is about one man and his journey of failure to success after he takes over the family farm.

Having grown up in a farming community and seeing many, many estate auctions of failed farmers as American agriculture shifted from farmers as ""men of the dirt"" to farmers as ""men of the corporation"", I was very interested in this movie. However, I don't feel it delivered on that level. John is largely responsible for his failure though he did receive a lot of help in failing from those around him that didn't understand him and USDA policies and rhetoric (the one thing the USDA is good at). He is also very responsible for his success despite all those around him, so again, good story but not about farming, just related to it.

As an aside, the little movie about bees contained within this movie, is VERY good. Loved that!

2991758,2,B000WTVZ3U,"The Real Dirt on Farmer John concerns a middle-aged farmer, John Peterson, who lives on land that has been handed down in his family since the 1930s. John's tragic story is typical of what has befallen so many family farms in the U.S. over the past hundred years - times are tough. Eventually, John decided to try organic farming to save his farm.

The twist in the story is that John is a bohemian. He attended Beloit College in Wisconsin and enjoyed everything that the counterculture had to offer. But when John tried to bring the counterculture's ideals to his farm, the neighbors weren't very happy.

The two paragraphs above provide a broad overview of the film - otherwise, nothing much happens. In this narcissistic film, the viewer is forced to watch Peterson:
-  eat dirt from his farm,
-  walk around the farm in unique clothing (such as a bee costume), and
- Go on periodic trips to Mexico when things on the farm get to be too much.

Peterson also filmed his mother when she was near death from brain cancer. She is barely responsive and I wondered if she was able to consent to being filmed - at the very least the scene is uncomfortable to watch.

John portrays himself as something of a martyr when discussing neighbors' disapproval of him. He claims that the neighbors burned down a building on his property, but offers no definitive proof. In the end, the only certain thing is that people in John's small town don't care for people who are different - which will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever lived in a small town.

To be fair, there are some strong aspects of the film. One thing that I liked was the cinematography - the film looks nice on the screen. Also, the local sheriff - a man John claims has tormented him - appears and offers unintentional comedic relief as he admits that he kept close tabs on John. At one point the sheriff allows that it was OK if John had a devil worship cult at the farm - but the sheriff says that he was upset when John's alleged Satanic activities disturbed the cattle in the area.

2991761,5,B000WTVZ3U,"John Peterson's grandfather bought a farm following the Great Depression.  His father farmed it, and raised John to be a farmer as well.  But the easy credit of the 80s imploded, and John had to sell all but about 28 acres.

His satanic cult was prospering.

Except the credit crisis was real, and the cult was in the imagination of others.  They both affected Farmer John in profound ways.

The Real Dirt on Farmer John is John Peterson's story.  He grew up on the farm, but his dad's early death due to complications from diabetes put the farm on his shoulders.  This farm boy also went to a local college (Beloit) and was exposed for the first time to... people unlike him.  He fell in love with art and artists, and invited them to the farm.  Needless to say, artsy folk look and behave differently, and soon rumors of a satanic cult started circulating.  John was just trying to keep the farm, and his friendships, continuing.

The farm credit crisis led to a loss of the majority of the acreage, and his reputation, sullied, didn't endear him to the sheriff and his neighbors.  John traveled, trying to get his head together.

Eventually (and the path is described in this movie), he begins to develop his small farm into one producing organic farm products sold at a roadside stand.  This eventually becomes a community-supported agriculture (CSA) operation called Angelic Organics.

This entire story is touching, inspiring, and hopeful.  Farmer John refused to be pigeon-holed into a ""farmer"" stereotype, nor was he willing to hide or escape from his farming background.  What he learned was that his passions were shared by others, and today Angelic Organics is a model for the survival of other small-scale farmers.

His father died when he was still young and all the work fell on his shoulders.  He went to the closest college in the area, Beloit, which was, at that time a magnet for hippies from the East coast.  This expanded John's interests....and for a while the farm was a haven to kids from all over who wanted to be ""close to the land.""

I don't want to spoil the story but it is a wonderful tale of his progression as he goes through the changes in farming and the ups and downs of his personal life.  I felt a personal connection with the family since mine was from the same area and the folks in the home movies all looked very familiar.

I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves the land... and life.",1246492800,,838,4.104294478527607
2991765,5,B000WTVZ3U,"The Real Dirt on Farmer John tells the incredible yet true story of John Peterson who was one of the very few farmers able to remain a farmer after the devastating financial crisis most farms faced in the 1980s. The story is told very well with great footage of John's family and himself when he was younger growing up on what was then his parents' farm; this really serves to give us an excellent idea of what farming life was like back in the 1950s. There's also interesting commentary by John's neighbors even if they aren't always too kind to John; he was not like them so they thought him weird. Worse yet, they intentionally and very maliciously spread bad and false rumors about him which you will learn about as you watch this movie. The documentary flows along at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The cinematography is excellent, too.

We see wonderful footage of John Peterson growing up on the farm; his mother had purchased a movie camera and she loved to document their life on the farm. John is able to recall his father and his kindly Uncle Harold by reviewing these old home movies and that's great. We see them building their barn (this clip is actually near the end of the film) and we also see them plowing the fields and raising livestock.

The story is told through John's eyes; we learn how when John's father died he was expected at an early age (he was just starting to get ready for college) to run the farm; he even chose a college only eight miles away so that he could tend to the farm as much as possible. He especially didn't want to fail his parents by having the farm go south on his watch. We learn how the farm became a hippie haven in the 1960s when John was in college. The idealistic young men and women from Beloit College helped John to run the farm and they all had a great deal of fun doing it; this also introduced John to new ways of thinking and a whole new sense of artistic creativity and freedom that he cherishes to this day. Unfortunately, however, we also learn that the farm was not always an easy place and John admits that he had to take time away from the farm more than once in his life. He traveled to Mexico to deal with his feelings and get a reprieve from the pressure of it all.

Amazingly enough, John manages to save the farm despite the economic woes most farmers faced during the 1980s. I don't want to tell you how he saves the farm; it would spoil it for you and I don't want to do that. I have also left out some other material so that this documentary will be as powerful and interesting as possible without spoilers.

The DVD comes with some very nice bonus features. We get a documentary feature entitled ""Bitter Harvest;"" ""The Bug Song"" music video and ""The Farmer John Song"" music video. There are deleted scenes and even more!

The Real Dirt on Farmer John is quite a powerful, moving documentary that will touch your heart and stay in your mind for quite some while. John Peterson's story is inspiring to say the least; and that's terrific. I highly recommend this DVD.",1246060800,3,3055,4.380952380952381
2991766,5,B000WTVZ3U,"""It used to be that everyone in this country had a connection to farms, but now most of these farms have gone"".  This film shows the history of farming in the US, through the eyes of a particular farmer in the Midwest, John Peterson.  Bankruptcy eliminated most of the small family farms, being unable to pay back their loans from the 70's on through the 90's.  This was also the fate of John Peterson, who had to sell most of his land (330 acres), and was left with only 22 acres.

John Peterson is a wonderful individual.  He's not only a farmer, but he's also very fond of art.  He makes all kind of stuff, he writes, he paints, he sings, he makes music videos, he performs in theatre and of course he is the star of this movie.  He is also aware of his being not very common.  In his hippie period, he said his farm was located on the ""Midwest Coast"".

But he's also a tough guy.  No matter how big the misfortunes, after some retreat and meditation, he always comes back with a new plan, and goes forward.  So, after suffering from bankruptcy, he decided to quit chemicals and transforming his farm to organics, like it used to be, in the 20's, fertilizing with manure.  The next logical step was getting involved the community.  His farm, Angelic Organics, has now 1200 shareholders from a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme.  Each shareholder receives each week a box full of fresh and healthy vegetables and fruits.  This way, the farm performs its historical role again, reuniting the people with the source of the food.

We should definitively all be supporting farmers who switch to organics.  They need us, as we need them.  Look for organic farmers in your local communities.  It's good for your health and it's good for the environment.",1234483200,6,1760,4.583333333333333

I didn't know what to expect after seeing John plow a field in drag on his tractor but the film turned out to be more human and multi-dimensional in short order. From losing his father early to losing his mother late, John moves from a seemingly idyllic boyhood to a college experience that has one of his feet in the past and one in the future to an adulthood marked by a struggle to articulate his vision for living his life, all the while enduring the ignorant judgments and harassments of his neighbors. How fair and proper it is that John found his niche in organic CSA farming. May many happy days and bountiful harvests fill the rest of his years.",1233187200,5,714,4.416666666666667

I was attracted to it because it seemed like a ""triumph through adversity"" true story.  I really liked this movie a lot.  It was very well documented and a compelling story of large family farm that went through crisis and wound up re-inventing itself through the persistant vision of farmer John.  I really like how John follows his heart in farming and expressing his artistic endeavors.  There is no BS with this man.  His relationship with his mom was very touching too.  I was so inspired by this movie as to start to be more active in organic farming in my own yard.  I do not have a farm, but I do have a yard and access to good composting materials.  I also am looking into finding community supported agriculture (CSA) farms locally.  I was very interested in the biodynamic organic farming methods that John uses and is in Eliot Coleman's books.  I really enjoyed the musical pieces in the film by Leslie Littlefield too.  My son really loved the ""Bug Song"".  Overall it is very worthwhile watch that will inspire you to: Follow your dreams and heart, be persistant, deliver valuable goods and services which people will flock to, farm your large or small plot organically, and support locally grown organic produce.

3226220,4,B000WTVZ3U,"The BS factor seems to be relatively low. Very little pretense, from about as far as you can get from either coast. I'm not a farmer, but I lived close to this area & I can relate to the characters in this dying segment of the United States. John Peterson is an original, born & breed on a midwest farm. A farmer was all he ever wanted to be . It was his destiny & inheritance. Success, failure, success, failure, success. That is also an American story. But failure for the American farmer today is  inevitable. The farm John grew up on was a success. It fact it was easier to be a farmer post World War II than the mid 1960's & even today. John felt the guilt as his family's farm slipped slowly out of his grasp. He attended Beloit College in Wisconsin, basically because it was the school closest to the farm. People were drawn to him because of his natural goodness, forthrightness & nonconfrmist attitudes. He drew the counter-culture crowd, they used to be called hippies, to his farm in sort of a loose commune-type atmosphere. The economy of the whole country was entering a recession & farmers started losing their land, including John. Because he was a controversial character, he was a easy target to blame for the bad econmomic times. This is one man's life but it also an important documentary on the disappearence in America of the family farm from degradation of the land through chemical pesticides, fertilizers, overuse & urbanization. John, in another trait that is so very American was able to reinvent himself & yet able to stay on the land. It is that oppotunity for second & even third chances that has drawn people fron all over the world for over two hundred years. I did not know about this movie until I saw a blurb on the cover of the dvd in a rental store that indicated the Al Gore has viewed it. Some excellent extras, including two music videos fron John's girlfriend, Lesley Littlefield, that I watched twice. Really, a worthwhile effort.",1202860800,27,1971,4.567796610169491

Adults can relate to the wonderful family histories of people and property, the way one's occupation can break your heart, the need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off afterwards, and the powerful pain that made-up gossip can inflict.  I especially appreciated the film maker's gifts for making the audience see and respect people who can seem invisible in our society.  For example, an aging mom or the Mexican-American worker with a gazillion handy skills.  My church paired this movie with Barbara Kingsolver's ""Animal, Vegetable, Miracle"" for a thought-provoking focus on the food we eat and how we obtain it.",1202601600,12,839,5.147058823529412
3226222,4,B000WTVZ3U,"I didn't know what to expect from `The Real Dirt on Farmer John'.  Knowing that America was once known as ""the bread basket of the world,"" I knew this documentary would have some import, but I never realized that it would be this engaging.

You get the idea you've stumbled into a different story when John Peterson, the focal point and protagonist of this little movie, is performing his work on farm machinery looking like Elton John if he had become a farmer.  Flamboyantly dressed, we see a man with a colorful personality and an even more colorful past.

Since The Depression John's Scandinavian family obtained a farm in North Central Illinois where corn and hogs kept their existence simple, yet plentiful.  After his father died when he was fairly young, John had to take over the farm with his mother's support and his uncle's inspiration.  Determined, John like many other of his neighbors, fell upon hard times.  Remembering Willie Nelson's initiatives with ""Farm Aid"" during the eighties, the film reminded me so much of those news reports that showed the farmer's existence being put to the way side.  Like many effective documentaries, this film has home movies showing actual auctions as many American farmers lost their livelihood to real estate developers.  The shift in America's agriculture is entirely accessible in this fun and informative little DVD.

Education was John's ace in the hole.  He went to Beloit Community College during the hippie era and was able to recruit several friends who wanted the communal lifestyle.  Artsy met earthy, and John offered a virtual paradise.  Yet, differences often create suspicion, and John's neighbors started rumors that devastated him personally and financially.  People started to scapegoat John for misfortunes that occurred and labeled him a Satanic cult member.  At the head of the opposition was Sheriff Don, who is often interviewed and makes the story less remote and more real.

While John is resourceful, what actually transpires and how he copes is enough to see it all for yourselves.  'The Real Dirt on Farmer John' is an enjoyable experience that yields a large crop of interest.

(I have two things in common with John Peterson.  One is that we both bear the same name, and the other is that we both grew up eighty miles apart from one another in Illinois.)",1200787200,23,2336,4.943589743589744

It is a story about a farmer who experiences tremendous adversity, and it is an inspiring story and you do feel for the fellow. But it is not a farm film at all.

Having grown up in a farming community and seeing many, many estate auctions of failed farmers as American agriculture shifted from farmers as ""men of the dirt"" to farmers as ""men of the corporation"", I was very interested in this movie. However, I don't feel it delivered on that level. John is largely responsible for his failure though he did receive a lot of help in failing from those around him that didn't understand him and USDA policies and rhetoric (the one thing the USDA is good at).

My parents are from Iowa and Illinois, so this Mid-western tale struck close to home. The documentary really showed how backward thinking folks can be back home and forward thinking, plus resilient.

3226255,2,B000WTVZ3U,"The Real Dirt on Farmer John concerns a middle-aged farmer, John Peterson, who lives on land that has been handed down in his family since the 1930s. John's tragic story is typical of what has befallen so many family farms in the U.S. over the past hundred years - times are tough. Eventually, John decided to try organic farming to save his farm.

The twist in the story is that John is a bohemian. He attended Beloit College in Wisconsin and enjoyed everything that the counterculture had to offer. But when John tried to bring the counterculture's ideals to his farm, the neighbors weren't very happy.

The two paragraphs above provide a broad overview of the film - otherwise, nothing much happens. In this narcissistic film, the viewer is forced to watch Peterson:
-  eat dirt from his farm,
-  walk around the farm in unique clothing (such as a bee costume), and
- Go on periodic trips to Mexico when things on the farm get to be too much.

Peterson also filmed his mother when she was near death from brain cancer. She is barely responsive and I wondered if she was able to consent to being filmed - at the very least the scene is uncomfortable to watch.

John portrays himself as something of a martyr when discussing neighbors' disapproval of him. He claims that the neighbors burned down a building on his property, but offers no definitive proof. In the end, the only certain thing is that people in John's small town don't care for people who are different - which will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever lived in a small town.

To be fair, there are some strong aspects of the film. One thing that I liked was the cinematography - the film looks nice on the screen. Also, the local sheriff - a man John claims has tormented him - appears and offers unintentional comedic relief as he admits that he kept close tabs on John. At one point the sheriff allows that it was OK if John had a devil worship cult at the farm - but the sheriff says that he was upset when John's alleged Satanic activities disturbed the cattle in the area.

Perhaps ""back-to-the-earth"" folks will enjoy The Real Dirt on Farmer John. Its charms were lost on me.",1296691200,4,2154,4.4770408163265305

3226258,5,B000WTVZ3U,"John Peterson's grandfather bought a farm following the Great Depression.  His father farmed it, and raised John to be a farmer as well.  But the easy credit of the 80s imploded, and John had to sell all but about 28 acres.

His satanic cult was prospering.

Except the credit crisis was real, and the cult was in the imagination of others.  They both affected Farmer John in profound ways.

The Real Dirt on Farmer John is John Peterson's story.  He grew up on the farm, but his dad's early death due to complications from diabetes put the farm on his shoulders.  This farm boy also went to a local college (Beloit) and was exposed for the first time to... people unlike him.  He fell in love with art and artists, and invited them to the farm.  Needless to say, artsy folk look and behave differently, and soon rumors of a satanic cult started circulating.  John was just trying to keep the farm, and his friendships, continuing.

The farm credit crisis led to a loss of the majority of the acreage, and his reputation, sullied, didn't endear him to the sheriff and his neighbors.  John traveled, trying to get his head together.

Eventually (and the path is described in this movie), he begins to develop his small farm into one producing organic farm products sold at a roadside stand.  This eventually becomes a community-supported agriculture (CSA) operation called Angelic Organics.

This entire story is touching, inspiring, and hopeful.  Farmer John refused to be pigeon-holed into a ""farmer"" stereotype, nor was he willing to hide or escape from his farming background.  What he learned was that his passions were shared by others, and today Angelic Organics is a model for the survival of other small-scale farmers.

This expanded John's interests....and for a while the farm was a haven to kids from all over who wanted to be ""close to the land.""

I don't want to spoil the story but it is a wonderful tale of his progression as he goes through the changes in farming and the ups and downs of his personal life.

3226262,5,B000WTVZ3U,"The Real Dirt on Farmer John tells the incredible yet true story of John Peterson who was one of the very few farmers able to remain a farmer after the devastating financial crisis most farms faced in the 1980s. The story is told very well with great footage of John's family and himself when he was younger growing up on what was then his parents' farm; this really serves to give us an excellent idea of what farming life was like back in the 1950s. There's also interesting commentary by John's neighbors even if they aren't always too kind to John; he was not like them so they thought him weird. Worse yet, they intentionally and very maliciously spread bad and false rumors about him which you will learn about as you watch this movie. The documentary flows along at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The cinematography is excellent, too.

We see wonderful footage of John Peterson growing up on the farm; his mother had purchased a movie camera and she loved to document their life on the farm. John is able to recall his father and his kindly Uncle Harold by reviewing these old home movies and that's great. We see them building their barn (this clip is actually near the end of the film) and we also see them plowing the fields and raising livestock.

The story is told through John's eyes; we learn how when John's father died he was expected at an early age (he was just starting to get ready for college) to run the farm; he even chose a college only eight miles away so that he could tend to the farm as much as possible. He especially didn't want to fail his parents by having the farm go south on his watch. We learn how the farm became a hippie haven in the 1960s when John was in college. The idealistic young men and women from Beloit College helped John to run the farm and they all had a great deal of fun doing it; this also introduced John to new ways of thinking and a whole new sense of artistic creativity and freedom that he cherishes to this day. Unfortunately, however, we also learn that the farm was not always an easy place and John admits that he had to take time away from the farm more than once in his life. He traveled to Mexico to deal with his feelings and get a reprieve from the pressure of it all.

Amazingly enough, John manages to save the farm despite the economic woes most farmers faced during the 1980s. I don't want to tell you how he saves the farm; it would spoil it for you and I don't want to do that. I have also left out some other material so that this documentary will be as powerful and interesting as possible without spoilers.

The DVD comes with some very nice bonus features. We get a documentary feature entitled ""Bitter Harvest;"" ""The Bug Song"" music video and ""The Farmer John Song"" music video. There are deleted scenes and even more!

The Real Dirt on Farmer John is quite a powerful, moving documentary that will touch your heart and stay in your mind for quite some while. John Peterson's story is inspiring to say the least; and that's terrific. I highly recommend this DVD.",1246060800,3,3055,4.380952380952381
3226263,5,B000WTVZ3U,"""It used to be that everyone in this country had a connection to farms, but now most of these farms have gone"".  This film shows the history of farming in the US, through the eyes of a particular farmer in the Midwest, John Peterson.  Bankruptcy eliminated most of the small family farms, being unable to pay back their loans from the 70's on through the 90's.  This was also the fate of John Peterson, who had to sell most of his land (330 acres), and was left with only 22 acres.

John Peterson is a wonderful individual.  He's not only a farmer, but he's also very fond of art.  He makes all kind of stuff, he writes, he paints, he sings, he makes music videos, he performs in theatre and of course he is the star of this movie.  He is also aware of his being not very common.  In his hippie period, he said his farm was located on the ""Midwest Coast"".

But he's also a tough guy.  No matter how big the misfortunes, after some retreat and meditation, he always comes back with a new plan, and goes forward.  So, after suffering from bankruptcy, he decided to quit chemicals and transforming his farm to organics, like it used to be, in the 20's, fertilizing with manure.  The next logical step was getting involved the community.  His farm, Angelic Organics, has now 1200 shareholders from a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme.  Each shareholder receives each week a box full of fresh and healthy vegetables and fruits.  This way, the farm performs its historical role again, reuniting the people with the source of the food.

We should definitively all be supporting farmers who switch to organics.  They need us, as we need them.  Look for organic farmers in your local communities.  It's good for your health and it's good for the environment.",1234483200,6,1760,4.583333333333333
