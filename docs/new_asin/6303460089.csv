652492,3,6303460089,"I have a good majority of Gary Daniels' films. This is the second movie that he plays the bad guy. Unfortunately, he does not get enough screen time; but then again, this movie doesn't do him justice. He is one of the two leading roles, and they do more talking about his character than you actually see his character. For example--his character is supposed to be a real evil guy and the main nemesis, yet you get more insight to all the other bad-guy characters more than you do Gary's character. And for a martial arts film, you hardly see him practicing and/or fighting. Gary should have turned down the role!!",1218931200,,613,4.531531531531532
652493,3,6303460089,"Former actor/kickboxer Albert Pyun conceived and directed this futuristic kickboxing movie.  It's mainly just a series of well-staged kickboxing exhibitions, featuring some of the sports' most notable figures.  The plot (what little there is) focuses on the only human world champion kickboxer, played with little vitality by Keith Cooke.  One of the cyborg companies, helmed by villainous Tim Thomerson and Norbert Weisser, creates a real killing machine, played like a machine by the usually more reliable Gary Daniels.  Daniels' fans may be in for a shock as he is an out and out bad guy in this one.  Usually when good guys go bad, their performances do as well?  Anyway, to ensure that Daniels wins this corporate-sponsored tournament, they kidnap Cooke's manager/girl friend, and install a microchip in her neck which makes her go gaga if she doesn't behave--and the mean Weisser makes Jo train Daniels (which makes no sense).

The required preliminaries produce the two finalists:  Cooke and Daniels, in a rather anticlimactic and unexciting match.

There is some corporate satire here but overall it's all been done to death, and only the fighting sequences make it worth catching.",1092528000,,1189,5.21578947368421
652494,2,6303460089,"Here's Keith Cooke playing Chance O'Brien, world kickboxing champion in a future not many years hence. A new generation of fighters sporting a variety of cybernetic enhancements is coming up, certain of their superiority. To prove which corporation manufactures the most advanced cybernetics, a no-holds-barred tournament is held where every fight is to the death, and Chance is the only competitor who's purely human. This is an idea with potential. But it's so badly executed, and the ending is such a complete waste, that it's a total embarrassment.
This can be laid soley at the feet of the writer/director. The actors all turn in creditable performances, but they're fighting an uphill battle. Don't bother with this movie.",1039392000,,728,5.230769230769231

652496,5,6303460089,"In the search for disconcluded titles there is always the risk that the movie won't be up to your standards and you will have spent outrageous amounts of time or money or both on somthing dissaponting.  But let me assure you this one is a true diamond. If your a big martial arts fan this lost video is the treasure that leads us to addictions.  Its a tounament style fighting movie with Keithe Cook and Gary Daniels in which the leading product in the world is cybernetic implants that make you look better and give you instant athlettasism. The only fighter that does not have implants is Chance O'Brien (cook) who is considdered in the movie to be the best fighter in the world. In order to rescue his kidnapped love he has to go through the tournament full of companies selling thier augmentation using the tourament as a national advertiseing method. Very creative and eloborite powerful fight scenes.
If you like this kind of stuff as much as I do, I'd say do whatever it takes to find this movie and get it in your VCR!",983404800,4,1026,4.481283422459893

He has the all the qualities, and the best, not like others martial  artist, who have a lot of bad movies, whith horribles fights secuences.

652568,1,6303460089,"The actors may well be good -- one cannot judge when the directing is weak and the script little more than non-existent. Imagine, if you will, a Dick-and-Jane book for little kids into which a villain (corporation & marketing exec) and a not-so-intentional villain have been introduced. Can you hear the dialogue? See Dick fight. See Jane be blackmailed. See Dick jump to conclusions based on 40% of the facts.

What is really sad is that the concept has real possibility in the hands of good script writers and better direction. To be fair to the director, when the script is little better than ""See Spot take a Poop"" the scope for excellence is fatally compromised.",1426032000,,667,4.75

652575,4,6303460089,"This is a straight to VHS style movie that for some reason I like. Something about the bad acting mixed with terrible fight choreography yet you can tell the fighters are talented in some of the more unusual styles of martial arts. The sloppy cut edits makes me laugh, along with Tim Thomerson's red hair. I had a ""Hey, it's THAT guy!"" moment before I recognize Gary Daniels who plays Xao. I remember him mostly from Jackie Chan's City Hunter. (Love the Street Fighter II scene in City Hunter where he played Ken!)

652576,5,6303460089,"When evaluating the action films of the 90's one factor is very evident. That factor would be; they simply cannot get enough cyborgs. Never before has a decade explored the studio space in the cyborg department as well as the 90's. It's a decade that couldn't take the typical man vs man battles, it had to kick it up and sprinkled in some half human half robot action. A concept we couldn't be happier with. So obviously when we came across Heatseeker and read the synopsis ""A kickboxer declines an invitation to participate in a kickboxing championship where a company plans to plant cyborg-enhanced fighters. When he declines, the company kidnaps his fiance forcing his participation,"" we said oh man we gotta get in on that. Sure it's a film that's been done more then once, but when a concept isn't broke why would you fix it?

So Heatseeker starts out with our films hero Chance O'Brien, guess Lance Uppercut would be too obvious, as he wins the championship for the greatest fighter on the planet. With this win he gains the attention of the diabolical Tsui Tung, who runs an underground cyborg fighting arena. Tsui offers Chance O'brien a shot at the title but is turned down. Being Tsui doesn't approve of the answer, him and some goons sneak attack O'brien and kidnap his old lady. Once this happened Sid was floored because this film has clearly lifted parts of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring-VHS/dp/6302669960/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring [VHS</a>] plot! Tsui parallels Vachs in an identical fashion, down to the bad guy lair and weird Chinese chick. Seriously...this guy had a deranged Chinese chick too! Naturally O'brien is the film's Matt Collins and exacts his revenge by fighting cyborg after cyborg. In the end he gets the girl and roundhouse kicks Tsui with such force that he actually dies. The final frame is an ultra B zoom in of a sweaty O'brien with the look of victorious fury in his eyes.

Heatseeker in itself was pretty awesome if we may say so. Our guess is it had to be awesome when your going to lift the plot of Death Ring, except sprinkling in some cyborg action. We honestly couldn't even get mad about it, because if your going to emulate something why not emulate the best? Obviously it paled in comparison to the mighty Death Ring, but delivered so much confusion and poor poor acting we just had to love it. The fighting scenes are typical B fashion. Not one punch or kick comes within a foot of anyone....just the way we love it. The only thing missing from this movie was a cyborg version of Apache. Now if we had seen something like that we easily could have found a Woody Award for best picture in Heatseeker.",1303257600,2,2720,4.834763948497854

7847634,3,6303460089,"Keith Cooke, the cult superkicker who many people would've loved to see in more movies, achieves something of a career pinnacle with Heatseeker  the only starring vehicle hes ever had. Disappointingly, this high point does not exactly constitute a highlight, per se. Consistently flawed despite an explosion of physical talent, the film just barely manages to scrape a decent rating through sheer grit. I don't recommend it, but the B-movie aficionado in me won't allow a lower ranking.

The story: In a future when organized combat is waged by technology-enhanced cyborgs, the last 100% human fighter (Cooke,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-O-Brien/dp/B000F3WBKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China O'Brien</a>) is forced to enter a deadly tournament by a ruthless corporate agent (Norbert Weisser,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Doom/dp/B0002XVSKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Doom</a>).

Cooke is in great shape and shows off all his best taekwondo moves, but his character is bland beyond all likeability. He and the rest of the performers are at the mercy of a script that directs its energy into unwanted venues. The crux of the story is the kidnapping of the leads manager/fianc&eacute;; Tina Cote (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Guns/dp/1573624063/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Guns</a>) was one of the movies few opportunities for dramatic worth, but her character spends most of the feature being mind-controlled and molested in a farfetched plan to get villainous fighter Gary Daniels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Tiger/dp/B0009ETCZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Tiger</a>) to fall in love with her. Cookes character is left almost completely in the background. Its an oddly joyless story, plagued by an epidemic of white characters with Asian names: Daniels is called Xao, fighter Chad Stahelski is called Chung, and Norbert Weissers character is called Tung and spends the movie wearing teashade sunglasses.

The fight content becomes the pictures last opportunity for entertainment value, and overall, it succeeds (though to what degree diminishes as one's expectations rise). A whopping 20 full-length fight scenes almost guarantee that there will be at least some matches for anyone to enjoy, and the cast includes a nice selection of onscreen fighters - Thom Matthews, Burton Richardson, Jahi Zuri, John Machado, and Richard Cetrone. I was pleased to see that significantly less slow motion and obstructive editing have been utilized than is Albert Pyuns norm, though the choreography tends to be bland and the pacing far from dynamic. The Cooke/Daniels dream matchup is decent, though my favorite fight is a winning effort for Pyun regular Earl White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis-2-Nebula/dp/6303584616/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis 2: Nebula</a>).

Theres a bit of B-movie abandon to keep things entertaining enough throughout, including an odd scene in which Cooke is beaten unconscious by some thugs for no reason before having his clothes stolen by children, leaving him to run naked through Manila. Maybe experiences like that limited the mans willingness to submit himself to the whims of a director, but whatever the reason ol Keith never received top billing afterwards, you can be assured that the ranking of his credit does not indicate the quality of this movie. I better post this before I rethink my generosity",1446076800,,3594,6.281947261663286
