This one though, man, it can only fall into the so bad its good category. Flying fish that eat people.....ok...this guys randomly snorting fish scale powder cause hes convinced its cocaine, then he turns into a fish monster........okie dokie. Please be intoxicated and with some friends while watching. Otherwise you'll be forcing yourself through the movie by yourself like I did upon first viewing. I don't suggest that.",1373587200,,541,5.089887640449438
7943074,4,B00005KB6O,This movie is just plain fun to watch.  The effects aren't too bad and just - the whole film is so quirky that you cannot help but watch it.  It really has everything in place for a great shlocky horror film.,1347580800,,208,4.048780487804878
7943075,3,B00005KB6O,"When I saw all the American names,I was immediately confused by the horrible dubbing. People are talking, but the camera doesn't show their face. Three young ladies and two horn dogs go boating. As luck would have it, the motor conks out and it is raining. Fortunately a yacht is nearby and they are rescued, only to find an experimental oceanographic research vessel specializing in deep water life, that is empty.

The five make themselves at home and attempt to figure out the enigma. The girls take off their bikini tops to dry off and one was nice enough to shower (full frontal nudity). They consume the fish in the refrigerator, a major plot point as they now become infected with a carnivorous mutated fish that lives out of water (the smaller ones fly through the air.)  Fish-People turn against people.

The special effects were bad. The plot, which started out good, became silly when they used the bad special effects. The dialouge was very weak. With the movie being so obviously dubbed, they should have created new dialouge with some hip American slang instead of attempting a phrase for phrase translation. The movie was originally titled, ""Plankton.""  The girls were pretty which might be the only reason to watch this film.

F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1314057600,,1263,4.855813953488372
7943076,2,B00005KB6O,"needed more action and creature action, longer creature closeup time. kinda fake and dumb movie. i like the flying fish and grosse creature stuff later. they could have made this picture more fun and interesting tords the end somehow.",1239667200,,234,5.0256410256410255
7943077,3,B00005KB6O,"Creatures From The Abyss follows a group of five kids who get stranded out in the ocean when they run out of gas.  They find an abandoned yacht and come aboard.  Of course in horror films we all know this is a classic case of ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"".  The yacht was used by a crew of scientists studying radioactive fish.  The crew are all toast, but the fish monsters remain and proceed to attack our heroes.  The science of the fish is more complex than it should be, but two things are for sure-The fish are carnivorous and HORNY.  One guy is having sex with a chick and then starts transforming into a large fish while he also vomits small fishlike monsters on the girl's face(his eye also pops out and falls into her mouth).  Later she gives a painful birth(or is it a miscarriage?) to what looks like a big gloppy puddle of caviar.
I realize how tantalizing I'm making this film sound, but it's really only so-so.  It seems to take quite a while for anything to really happen, and even when it does it still seems kinda boring in a way.  The acting is what you'd expect, and the characters are the usual suspects are far as cliches go. As expected, they do and say inept and illogical things.  If your boyfriend was being strangled by a woman with a giant fish monster protruding from her head, I seriously doubt saying, ""Please, leave him alone"" is gonna help much.
It's not without it's entertainment value though.  It's so cheap and dumb that it's funny and amusing at times.  One particularly funny part has to do with the ship's alarm system.  It's one of those verbal alarm systems that tells the crew when the self destruct mechanism has been activated and is counting down.  There's also a verbal coach for the shower to tell you how and when to masturbate.  Anyhow, the self destruct is activated and the alarm is instructing to evacuate.  After a few minutes of the characters running around in panic the alarm says, ""Is anyone listening to me?  I still hear footsteps!  Evacuate!""  I don't know, I just found that quite funny.
The look of the film is the typical look of the Italian films of the late 80/early 90s.  Think Zombi 3.  The DVD has an interview with the director which lasts only a minute or so.  Not much to say about the film I suppose, and I don't blame him.
Anyhow, it's good for a laugh, but Argento it ain't.",1217116800,,2361,4.391705069124424
7943078,4,B00005KB6O,"yes, this movie is BAD! but it's fast paced and very funny! it's not like watching Manos: the Hands of Fate, which is just painful. it's an Italian teen horror film from the 80's so expect anything. the dubbing is the most obnoxious and hilarious i think i've ever heard. image quality is pretty decent. hell, it's a win win situation. fun flick. very cheap. and you can even get it in an inexpensive triple feature set from Shriek Show if you wanna boost some weirdness to your collection.",1207958400,,490,4.51685393258427
7943079,3,B00005KB6O,"This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen. In fact I found it enjoyable. It's about these 5 kids who go out on boat trip on the ocean and end up running out of gas. They then spot another
ship and they then board it. (it's deserted of course), except for one derelict who's lines throughout the movie were..grrnnt,
uhgggffhh and some other unintelligle gack.
The kids then start wondering what happened to the crew when one of the guys begins reading about the crew's experiments with the
fish etc. One of the guys thinks it was a lab to mfr drugs(wait till you see what happens to him)
The movie itself wasn't bad, the acting was kind of lame. The SFX
were some stop-motion and other just hammy kind some good scenes.
The part I like is when one of the guys turns into a fish/squid
something or other while he's making love.(She gets mutated also)
The part i thought that really sucked was when the ship exploded at the end, sheesh they could of at least used a miniature and blown that up instead of superimposing flames etc over the ship
Other than that i thought it was an ok flick",1020729600,2,1086,4.354679802955665
7943080,2,B00005KB6O,"I was looking forward to watching this previously unreleased (at least in the States) euro-horror flick originally known as ""Plankton"" which is about some mutant fish terrorizing 5 teens on an abandoned research ship.  I knew ahead of time it was going to be bad, but I was not prepared for the magnitude of how godawful it actually was.  Does that mean I didn't enjoy it?  Of course not --- it's so inept in every way that you can't help but laugh at it's amateurish execution.  Atrocious acting and dubbing (the voices are so detached that sometimes it is hard to figure out which character is talking!), awful special effects (superimposed animated flying fish!), terrible editing, phony rubber monsters (and one stop-motion tentacle-man-creature), and even explosion fireball footage superimposed over a model ship being blown apart.  Even the few 'gore' scenes are disastrous because they build up and don't deliver...and what's with that animated fish (?) flying out of that chick's mouth?!?!  Her head should have exploded instead (guess they didn't have the money to do that).  Best scene is when a guy turns into a fish monster when making love to one of the girls.  His eye pops out of his head and falls in her mouth.  Yeaah!  Unfortunately, there are quite a few lulls in between the chuckles and the film really is recommended only for diehard euro-trash fans.  It's good for a few laughs, but I doubt it will revisit my DVD player anytime soon.
So how does the DVD look?  Thankfully, the film is sharp and does not suffer from that awful artifacting that was so evident on Shriek Show's ""Demonia"" DVD.  So, this is a very good sign for Shriek Show and bodes well for their upcoming releases.  The extras include a few trailers (Demonia and 2 Asian horror flicks - which are not at all my thing and the 2 trailers showcase exactly why I dislike that genre so much), but not a trailer for ""Creatures From the Abyss"" which is probably because there never was one.  There is a picture gallery (which I didn't bother going through) and a brief on-screen director interview - if I were the director, I would have been embarrassed to show my face!  Anyway, I must admit that even though the movie really BITES, it does have a weird charm to it and this DVD is a welcome release from Shriek Show.  Looking forward to many other obscure and ""unreleasable"" releases from them in the coming months.",1008374400,8,2401,4.692124105011933
7943081,4,B00005KB6O,"All I knew about this title was that it was an Italian horror film.  I'm glad I took a chance on this DVD, because Creatures From The Abyss (AKA Plankton) turned out to be a hoot.  From the bad dubbing and inane dialog, to the cheezy, but fun SPFX, this one reminded me of later films by Lamberto Bava (Graveyard Disturbance, Prince of Terror) and Lucio Fulci (Ghosts of Sodom, Zombie 3). The plot is simple: 5 kids out for a good time take refuge on a deserted ship, where they soon discover mutant plankton, which attack them one by one.  Some of the effects reminded me of Carpenter's The Thing, but much more crude. So grab a six pack and enjoy.  THIS ONE'S ONLY FOR THE MOST TOLERANT ITALIAN HORROR FANS!  you'll love it.",1002672000,5,726,4.348148148148148
