8481191,5,B000GAKOX2,I was glad to find this obscure horror film on dvd -I had been looking for it for a long time -it has a good looking creature in it,1520121600,,131,3.5517241379310347
8481192,4,B000GAKOX2,"The movie is called ''El Trono del Infierno'' from 1992 which in english it translates to The Throne of Hell, a story of a group of archaeologists that find a small idol in the shape of a small dog with ruby eyes, after unearthing the thing inside a vase they unleash a powerfull demoic force that causes both an eclipse & an earthquake, it also possesses one of the fellow archaeologists.
The demon inside of the man slowly starts to poison him to the point of bleeding from every hole in his head and change his voice to one more disrupted and more violent, on another side of the wold a bearded and long haired knight who it's asumed to be an angel awaits for the demon to fight banishing it to the hell it came.

This is one of the most badass Mexploitation movies i've ever seen, the make up and gore is pretty gruesome and detailed for such a short budget and the acting is pretty good too, it has some flaws like most movies do but it also has some memorable moments and the most ridiculous climatic battle between good and evil this side of the river.

A MUST SEE FOR EXPLOITATION & HORROR FANS.",1333324800,,1103,4.298076923076923
