8039993,4,B00067VVVY,"The Swiss Conspiracy was an ok movie, the sound quality wasn't too good and it was a little hard to follow but it is better than movies they make nowa days. Moon Of The Wolf was a great movie the sound quality wasn't that good either, but it kept your attention right until the end, it is the perfect Saturday night movie.",1307232000,,322,4.209677419354839
