I'm curious to see what will become of him and the direction of the show in the third season.  I never watched this while it was on TV but am glad to have it via Netflix.",1253836800,3,447,4.506172839506172

I hope whom ever the company is that put the Earlly Edition TV show out will complete the series their is nothing more earitating then to only be able to get half a series. That's Why I feel they should with the older shows put out the series in a completed form. It would be to their advantage to do so and if I may say give them a better return on their investment.,1252713600,,488,4.041237113402062

3874522,5,B0028SVY20,"What a treat to see more of this wonderful show on DVD, I have almost worn out my first season of this great show.  I can add no more to the first review's momments except...YOUR SO RIGHT!!!!",1246320000,,191,4.162162162162162
3874523,5,B0028SVY20,"Early Edition was one of the most interesting and entertaining hours on television during its run and after picking up season one, it's nice to see the second season of this fabulous show coming out. The characters were likable, and all too human at times, making them even more likable. Kyle Chandler proved the perfect choice as a regular guy with foibles who at first tries to cash in like any of us would on his good fortune, then realizes the great responsibility which has been laid at his door, quite literally.

Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) has been kicked out by his wife and forced to find a hotel. A yellow cat accompanies a newspaper which Gary eventually discovers is quite special. It is tomorrow's news today, and day after day it is delivered to Gary's door. He reacts as most of us would at first but his good nature finally takes over and he realizes there is a reason he's been chosen to receive the paper.

What followed each week was fabulous. One week it was humorous and the next heartbreaking. Shanesia Williams was terrific as his blind pal Marissa, who tried to keep him grounded and lead him towards the right path when the direction seemed unclear. Fisher Stevens was perfectly cast as his pal Chuck, who wanted to take advantage of Gary's windfall but often ended up helping him instead because deep down he was a good guy. It was sort of like Rockford and Angel, just less pronounced. At least in season one.

What helped to make the show special was the Chicago atmosphere and some tightly written shows about delicate choices made from the heart, some of which had grave consequences. The moral dilemmas continued, as in Quality of Mercy. In this episode, Gary saves someone, only to read the ""next"" paper, and discover that person is now going to kill someone innocent. There was always so much day to day slice of life humor in this show that you bonded with the characters in a way we don't anymore. The drama was human also, particularly so in The Medal, where a Vietnam Vet is racked with guilt.

The affection the writers had for classic movies came across to a great degree in season two. In Romancing the Throne, a Princess from Morania takes a break from her duties with Gary and helps save a couple of lives. It is obviously an homage to Roman Holiday. Where or When takes a page from Hitchcock's Rear Window, as Gary is laid up with a broken leg, and becomes tangled up with what may be a 50 year old murder just across the way. A Bris is Just a Bris is an obvious nod to A Kiss is Just a Kiss from Casablanca, even if the amusing story-line where Chuck starts telling the truth (gulp) and Gary gets tangled up with a klutzy librarian have little in common with the classic film. Anyone who's seen In Old Chicago with Tyrone Power and Alice faye will enjoy Hot Time in the Old Town, in which Gary wakes up two days before the great Chicago fire after a bump on the head!

The show's characters and their interactions had a very real feel and each show had its share of fine moments. Often mixed with humor, but sometimes quite poignant in the end, each week was special. From late September of 1997 to late May of 1998 fans of this show relished the hour spent each week with Gary and his pals.

Season two episodes include: Home--The Medal--The Wedding--Jenny Sloan--Down Sized--Angels and Devils--Redfellas--March in Time--A Regular Joe--A Bris is Just a Bris--A Minor Miracle--Romancing the Throne--Walk, Don't Run--Return of Crumb--Mum's the Word--When and Where--The Fourth Carpathian--The Quality of Mercy--Show Me the Monet--Don't Walk Away Renee-Hot Time in the Old Town--Second Sight

Having purchased season one for someone I love I'm glad season two is now on its way. Early Edition truly stands out as something of quality. Gary and his friends, and that mysterious yellow cat, were welcome visitors each week and this is another fantastic release for the show's many fans.",1242518400,44,3927,4.658008658008658
3874524,5,B0028SVY20,"This season is arguably better than Season One in the sense that the characters have been established and the writers were able to focus more on the episodes without having to worry about backgrounds, the ""how"" and ""why"" of the paper, etc.  But as many after me will probably say, all four seasons were excellent and we're looking forward to the last two seasons being released in the coming year or so.",1242518400,27,403,4.597222222222222

3874548,5,B0028SVY20,"The overall theme of the series's sophomore outing seems to be While there's life there's hopeor perhaps, It's never too late to mend.  Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) certainly finds enormous changes occurring in his own sometimes frantic life: not only does he continue to get tomorrow's Chicago Sun-Times today, courtesy of the marmalade tabby he calls Cat, but he's burned out of his apartment in the Blackstone Hotel and gifted with his long-time hangout, McGinty's Bar, which proves to have an upstairs loft that he transforms into a comfortable abode; and his mother, Lois (Tess Harper), joins his father, Bernie (William Devane), in knowing about the Paper.  Meanwhile Gary, his best friend Chuck Fishman (Fisher Stevens), who comes in to manage the bar while he's doing his saves, and blind Marissa Clark (Shanesia Davis-Williams), who becomes the bookkeeper and HR director for the business, cope with a laundry list of people including a heartless developer (Alex Rocco) who plans to demolish the house that serves as a group home for a bunch of orphans, a troubled Vietnam veteran (Louis Gossett Jr.), Gary's own former sweetheart (Cari Shayne) and her driven fianc, a young woman (Robyn Lively) supposedly dying of cancer and a boy with leukemia who's taken to refusing his treatments, and various others, including a Balkan princess who teaches them that sometimes the Paper knows even two or three days ahead what's going to happen (She had to be there..., as Chuck says), and one very angry mummy (yes, the Egyptian kindand not a human one, either!) that may or may not have some pretty strange powers.  Ron Dean returns as tough, skeptical, 250-pound plainclothesman Zeke Crumb, who, after retiring from the Chicago PD, joins McGinty's staff as a bartenderand begins to reveal that under his crusty exterior he's really rather fond of both Gary and Chuck.

So far this and the previous year are the only sets of EE available on DVD, although it ran for two more.  Buy them both, and bombard Paramount and CBS with requests to bring out the others!",1422662400,,2060,4.959420289855072

As a huge fan of 50's, 60's and 70's tv shows, this show delivers on great acting and good , clean shows. The stories are quality and well written, not slow and boring.  And Kyle Chandler is one VERY handsome man!!!! The only disappointment is, where are the rest of the seasons??? It's not fun watching and re-watching the same 2 seasons over and over and not being able to complete the series.

She likes that the stories are clean (no swearing or sex), Hobson's predicaments are clever and/or thoughtful, and I like that he always tries to do the right thing, a precious trait in a world that often disregards the importance of living by a good code of ethics.

What a great show to exemplify how people should behave- Love one another unconditionally and try to help others. Kyle Chandler is a very likeable, average, good-looking, easy going guy with two good friends, one with a conscience and one without which makes for the perfect dynamic and knowing that tomorrow's news is within reach and could help with financial issues.

me as rather unlikely (of course, once you assume that ""Early Edition"" is possible in the first place).",1300838400,,436,4.826666666666667
3874625,5,B0028SVY20,"This show was a favorite of mine with good old fashion moral lessons, and respect and concern and love for our neighbors who we know and those who we do not know. This series is just the kind of entertainment that is good for the entire family, and how much  of  television  can you say that for today??? I highly recommend this show and just wish it's concept would come back into T.V. today. Did I mention the elements of insights into the future in a unique way puts a really fun twist to each episode,even bringing some historic events into a unique view. BUY it !!!",1299369600,4,570,4.308411214953271

3874633,4,B0028SVY20,"This second season boxset played virtually fine (I tested each chapter of all 22 episodes on the five discs).

I remember watching the first season of Early Edition (well most of it) on ITV back in the late 90's and it was a lot of fun and a warm drama. It's just a shame that it only lasted four seasons and didn't last longer.

There was a delay in the UK for the second season. Eventually Sky One premiered it in the UK (along with the third and fourth seasons). I only caught the first two episodes, the season premiere ""Home"" and ""Faith"". So I'm glad that CBS DVD have finally released the second season on Region 1 after a twelve month wait.

Fingers crossed they release the third season around the same time next year (around June/July 2010), with episodic promos for all 23 episodes if possible, and the alternative ending to the second season episode ""Hot Time in the Old Town"" as DVD extras.",1256256000,4,902,4.421686746987952
3874634,5,B0028SVY20,"I nearly didn't make it through this season set because the first two discs contained weak episodes with too much sap and movie-of-the-week type topical stories.  Please.  I couldn't understand how I'd watched the entire series originally if it had gone this soft-headed in season two.  Fortunately I stuck with it and was rewarded in the last three discs with episodes that went back to, and often outdid, the strengths of season 1.  Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler)--the protagonist who gets tomorrow's Chicago Sun-Times today--is not a sap.  He tries to do his best and won't turn his back on those who he feels need him, but he is not entirely a willing hero, and he isn't too surprised when his help isn't welcomed.  Even more skeptical is his friend and co-worker Chuck (Fisher Stevens), who along with co-workers Marissa and ex-detective Crumb, helps to ground and expand the focus of the show.  After the first two discs, the show's humor returns, particular in the wonderful ""The Fourth Carpathian"" in which four Carpathian brothers, Crumb, and Gary's parents are featured in an episode that is light-hearted but still full of heart.  As Crumb says ""someone or something is watching over Gary"" and I appreciate that whoever is sending the newspaper is kept cryptic.  The first two discs veered too close to the worst of 'Touched By an Angel,' (even though I like the best of that show) but the last three discs maintain a good pace and are very entertaining. In honesty, the only episode I strongly remember of the whole run was that in which Gary sees his successor, and I dearly hope that the show will keep being issued so that I can be reach that point again.",1254700800,3,1667,4.740484429065744
8356996,5,B0028SVY20,This is a great show! I was fortunate enough to find season 1 for a great deal on a well known auction site. But theres no way I was going to pay such a high price for the second season. Thankfully there is a DVD rental place you can get both seasons as a rental for a fair price. Its affiliated with the most well known video streaming service. Hope this helps someone! And hopefully we will be able to get all of the seasons someday.,1509321600,,435,4.069767441860465
8356997,5,B0028SVY20,"I haven't bought it on DVD as I missed my chance to buy it at a decent price. Now the DVD is overly expensive. I have the first DVD and seasons 3 and 4 on DVD which are unfortunately bootlegged copies but I wanted them. I have the whole series on VHS from when it ran on CBS and Fox Family Channel. I wish that CBS Paramount did put the last two seasons on DVD. I'd rather have the official copy than a bootleg. They (CBS) realeased the complete set of ""Walker Texas Ranger"", I don't know why they didn't do that with Early Edition. This was a great show and a lot better than what's on TV now days and it's a shame it only lasted for 4 seasons when much worse shows like ""The Walking Dead"" won't go away. Anyway, just wanted to throw in my two cents.",1505952000,2,751,4.013333333333334

8357002,5,B0028SVY20,"An exceptional show from times (only 20 years ago) when you didn't have to shock to come up with ""good entertainment"". The lead actor has all the pathos needed to make you believe that he is exactly suited to the role even as he is dragged almost kicking and screaming to be a true ""angel of mercy"".
Whilst I am very glad they released seasons 1 and 2 onto DVD, they really should just get on with it and release seasons 3 and 4 as well. Its been seven years since they released the others.
If anyone is interested there is a petition to release them on change.org.
Given the amount of utter garbage that is quite happily released on DVD these days, I am shocked that it hasn't been done yet.",1456617600,9,692,4.25
