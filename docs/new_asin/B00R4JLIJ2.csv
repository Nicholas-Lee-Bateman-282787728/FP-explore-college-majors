6898661,5,B00R4JLIJ2,"I started practicing yoga a few years ago and took classes at a gym.  The classes were amazing and even though I'm not the most flexible person, I felt powerful, calm, strong, and energized after each class.  After leaving the gym because of the high cost, I've been searching for almost a year for a DVD that would give me the same feeling.  I've purchased 10 yoga DVDs, but my search has ended.  THIS DVD IS AMAZING!  It nearly mirrors the classes I took.  It is difficult for me because I'm not flexible and out of shape, but I just modify the moves to fit my needs.  I will never go anywhere again for yoga, this is it.

Great beginner DVD.  Challenging enough to give you a nice sweat!",1441929600,9,690,4.286821705426356
