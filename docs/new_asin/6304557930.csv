8512360,4,6304557930,"When my brother and I were quite young--our father taped this movie off some Kung-Fu Sunday show on his Beta machine. It really kept us amused. For probably the past 15 years or so the movie came up on and off in conversation--but no one knew the title of the movie. Finally I couldn't  resist any longer and I started searching for it. After poking around for a  bit and one movie bought that wasn't it--I finally had it in my hands. The  movie was just as remembered up until the cut snake scene. That was really  a disapointment as it was an important part in visually showing him learn  technique from the monkey. Hell-it was also amusing. It also seems to me  more was cut, like his training on the monkey dudes property after his  demise by the Snake Fist. Does anyone know how much is cut? My brother and I both really enjoyed reminicing  with this movie but was a bit turned off by the cut(s). Its still  fun--maybe someone has the forbidden  un-cut version?",964569600,2,966,4.406779661016949
