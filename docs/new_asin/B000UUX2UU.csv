2925262,5,B000UUX2UU,"Making their way to America with little to nothing, many Jewish immigrants escaped German persecution, and prepared for their own kind of war while living in the United States.  Each having their own reason to enlist, most did it for personal and/or ideological reasons, the immigrants soon became part of the Military Intelligence Training Center (MITC) at Camp Ritchie, Maryland.  Sometimes called the Military Institute of Total Confusion because of its revolutionary, unpredictable nature, these soldiers were to be used for the unique purpose of interrogating German prisoners of war.

With intimate knowledge of the enemy, the Ritchie Boys used their ingenuity and imagination to not only display conspicuous gallantry, but also engage in psychological and intelligence endeavors beneficial to the Allied efforts.  A typical soldier can be trained for war in half a year.  Becoming a fluent interpreter, translator, and interrogator in any foreign language simply can't be accomplished in that amount of time; as such, the Ritchie Boys had an invaluable purpose.

The majority of the documentary is about each soldier's role during the war, and the various interesting details each can remember.  Telling stories of their experiences during war with humility and comedy, recalling past events and how they're affected today, is hilarious at times and very inspiring at others.  Displaying other-worldly courage, one of the Ritchie Boys (Werner Angress) even jumped from a plane on D-Day, without having gone through Airborne training!  As someone who has been skydiving several times, this astonishes me.  Another soldier (Si Lewen) was part of a direct broadcast to German soldiers, an attempt to convince the enemy soldiers to surrender.  Since the broadcasts were initially from speakers adjacent to the microphone, high fatalities were guaranteed.  Countless other stories amaze throughout the documentary, and I'm quite sure I could listen to these guys for quite some time.

Former soldiers, military history buffs, and proud Americans should know about the important contributions made by Jewish immigrants during one of our nation's most precipitous moments.  Since I fit all three of the above qualifications, it's obvious that I loved the Ritchie Boys.",1218067200,15,2268,5.4798850574712645
2925263,5,B000UUX2UU,"The Ritchie Boys is  a valuable document on interrogation written for the
public and describing how a group of highly trained American GIs were
able during World War II to obtain priceless intelligence information from
German prisoners without resort to torture or inhumane treatment.  These
GIs have never received the recognition they deserved for saving countless
lives and helping to shorten the war.  Their methods and success contrast
with the barbaric treatment of prisoners and suspects by American personnel
during the second Iraq War. This is a book that will hold the attention even of
a reader initially believing that he has no interest in the subject!  It is a record
of heroes who could take justifiable pride in their significant accomplishments
but who never sought glory they deserved and deserve, as some are still living.

2925264,5,B000UUX2UU,"This is a wonderful chronicle of a group of men who take you down a path of memories few people even know about.  They are loveable and sad, intelligent and successful men who helped the US in WWII.  Interesting twists and turns.",1208563200,2,229,4.428571428571429
2925265,5,B000UUX2UU,"I first saw this as a special on the Discovery Network's Military Channel. I had to wait several months before it became available on Amazon but it was worth the wait to own it. These men's stories are compelling and fascinating. This dvd should be shown in every civics class in the country (provided we started HAVING civics classes again).

The men who trained at Camp Ritchie were almost exclusively European Jewish refugees who had just recently escaped from the Nazis. Yet they all volunteered to return to Europe to serve their newly adopted country.

They all took this very seriously but the dvd does make use of the usual humorous soldier stories. Such as the one where two of the Richie Boys who are now with the US Army in a forward area doing POW interrogations complete a fake prisoner interrogation report stating that they have captured Hitler's latrine orderly and he gave them very detailed information on the fuhrer's private parts. They sent it to their immediate superiors and they all had a good laugh. Until someone forwarded it to a higher HQ and a Colonel from Washington showed up to meet the latrine orderly for himself!

This is a must for any student of WW II.",1197072000,7,1189,4.679425837320574
2925266,5,B000UUX2UU,"Put me to use. That's what the so-called Ritchie Boys asked of the U.S. Army in World War II, and they got what they wanted. These new recruits, alien refugees--some fresh off the boat from Europe--were shipped off to Camp Ritchie to learn how the German military did its thing so they could interrogate prisoners in warzones. It's a World War II story that hadn't been told yet, and the Ritchie Boys themselves make for engaging watching and a wonderful story. These are soldiers most of us can relate to, people who weren't so good at handling firearms but became single-minded in their work to charm, confuse, and terrify POWs who showed up and had information they wanted.

This is an excellent addition to the growing sub-genres of Jewish and World War II documentaries, and sports skillful use of talking-head inteviews, music, and archival footage.

DVD Extras: A full 43 minutes of deleted scenes and personal accounts fill out the disc.",1195776000,11,945,4.863354037267081
2925267,5,B000UUX2UU,"After just happening to see this on television, my son took my brother an I on a tour of World War II Europe. Among others, we took a guided tours of Normandy, Ste Mar Eglise, Malmady, Bastogne and Auschwitz. Returning home, I took another look at The Boys - and it all came alive. Rather than a well done documentary, it a classic story of of the human race at its best - up against the human race at its worst. I'd reccomend this to anyone who enjoys authentic history, a great story and an excellent piece of film. The production is 5-star.

The stories of these gentlemen before, during and after the war is incredible. There's sad dark events and hysterical humor - all in the same film. It's a treasure.",1195171200,7,709,4.371212121212121
2925268,5,B000UUX2UU,Well done video about a small but important part of WW 2.  Ft. Ritchie was closed by BRAC so the history will soon be difficult to locate......,1407715200,,143,4.296296296296297
2925269,5,B000UUX2UU,"This was a really good documentary.  The only thing I would have wished were different would be a little more attention paid to how the RBs served no ONE particular unit; as MI they had some level of freedom to move between and among units.  I find that quite unusual.  Glad to recommend and it's a surprisingly easy, sometimes even humorous (although there is nothing funny about the war) watch for a WWII-related documentary.",1406678400,,427,4.743243243243243
2925270,4,B000UUX2UU,Interesting.,1406073600,,12,12.0
2925271,5,B000UUX2UU,Great film - amazing story.  Another piece of fascinating history.,1406073600,,66,5.6
2925272,5,B000UUX2UU,"This DVD describes how Jews exiled from Germany and other Nazi-occupied territory came to the USA, joined the US Army and went back to aid our war effort.  Important history.",1393891200,,174,4.8
2925273,5,B000UUX2UU,"I thought I was pretty well-informed about WWII but this was a facet of the war I had never heard.  I was entranced by the stories of the participants and the documentary did an excellent job of combining the interviews with photographs of the subject matter discussed.  Even the ""extras"" were great.  It was so good I have recommended it to others.",1377993600,,349,4.596774193548387
2925274,5,B000UUX2UU,Looking for a some good history; then watch this and see how we took good German Americans that help defeated the Nazi's,1375660800,,120,4.5
2925275,4,B000UUX2UU,Purchased this copy for a WWII navy veteran who worked at Fort Ritchie in the 50s and 60s.  Reliving his days at this beautiful former U.S. Army post is especially important for him.  The movie weaves a very telling story of the beginnings of U.S. Army counter-intelligence.  The individual stories of these men is a tribute to our country's dedication to opening up new vistas for all peoples who come to our shores.,1374883200,,417,4.684931506849315
2925276,4,B000UUX2UU,"Heard about this group from a family member of a serviceman who was a member of the Ritchie Boys, so I had to see what was said about them.  Had never heard about this group only about the Indians they recruited.  Great History.",1361318400,,228,4.27906976744186
2925277,5,B000UUX2UU,Most interesting and informational.  It shows how immigrints appreciate this country and are willing to show their appreciation by serving in the U.S. Army.  It's a great video to pass around to the family.,1350259200,,206,5.029411764705882
2925278,3,B000UUX2UU,"They were refugees from Germany and German-occupied Europe, and a few native-born Americans. They were mostly Jewish, and trained together at Camp Ritchie in Maryland. They are old men now, and the movie is their memories of their time in Europe as intelligence agents. Mostly, they were interrogators and interpreters. They also worked successfully in propaganda. In fact, as you would imagine, anywhere that knowledge of the local language and of German was essential.

There are some very interesting stories here, but there are also a lot of slow spots. I know one cannot judge documentaries against dramas, but for a documentary, it is good material and too conventional a presentation.",1336694400,3,691,5.225225225225225
2925279,5,B000UUX2UU,I was very impressed by this video.  One of the Ritchie Boys is a retired faculty member from the University I work at.  I had heard bits and pieces of this era of WWII for many years.  It is an amazing story of these young men and all that they endured during their very early adulthood. I would recommend this video to anyone who has an interest in history and the very human side of it.,1329782400,,389,4.092105263157895
2925280,5,B000UUX2UU,"Unique, sweet documentary about a mostly Jewish group of refugees who had fled
to America, and, wanting to do something to fight Hitler, became an intelligence
unit for the Army.

While occasionally very sad and moving, more than most WW II documentaries there
is a big dose of ironic Jewish humor in these men, as well as a very positive life force.

Simple in its construction -- mostly talking heads intercut with photos and newsreel
footage -- it manages to capture the awful insanity of war and the power of refusing
to give up a sense of humor at the same time.

A rare and powerful combination.",1321142400,2,601,4.598130841121495
2925281,5,B000UUX2UU,"My father was one of the Ritchie Boys, so this was a must.  He had been a member of an IPW team, and this DVD let me know what had been missing from his description of WW2. Since viewing this movie, I have spoken with some of the Ritchie Boys, and enjoyed our conversations immensely.  I have also visited the Ritchie Boys exhibit at the Holocaust Museum in Detroit.

This DVD has been an exciting adventure into the (personal) past.",1318032000,,433,4.3875
2925282,5,B000UUX2UU,"As always, amazon is a fast dependable company. Have shopped here for hears and plan to continue. Thank you amazon, for your excellent customer service.",1316390400,,152,5.12
2925283,5,B000UUX2UU,"I just viewed this film on-line and am still in shock. One of the Ritchie Boys is a former employer whom I was Personal Assistant to in the late 80s in NYC! If only he had shared this part of his life with me! Fred Howard in the film is the same flamboyant, over-the-top, brash man he was in the office. Tall, very handsome, with a distinct German accent, he returned after WWII to make a name for himself in business. The word 'genius' is not sufficient to describe his mind. When you walk into a Duane-Reade, Walgreens, or supermarket, you will see his designs. He invented the ""Leggs Egg"" among other items we take for granted. All the shelving that holds the merchandise. I knew he was brilliant but had no idea of his involvement in the war.

If only Fred Howard had told me of this background he would have learned something about me he never knew--my uncle was shot down over Germany, was captured and imprisoned in a Stalag until the end of the war.  A tall, football player in high school, he returned to the US at the end of the war weighing barely 120 pounds. Mr. Howard and I could have talked for hours about the war because I became obsessed with the subject of Germany during WWII and to this day continue to study it. Amazon.com can certainly verify this with the films and books I have purchased over the years on Hitler, Count Von Stauffenberg, Heydrich, Albert Speer, Ernst Hanfstaengl and numerous other famous figures from that era.

I remember attending Mr. Howard's 60th birthday party at Le Cirque in 1987. He is now 84 and I am almost 70. This film was made in 2004 so I don't know if Fred Howard is still alive. I would love to have the opportunity to visit with him and his wife and have a long talk about what I saw in this remarkable film. He did mention working for intelligence during the war but, to be honest, I didn't believe him! Blame it on my youth!

I happened upon this film by accident. This film should be shown in every high school and university in America. Young German men (all Jewish) who left Germany in the 30s and arrived in the US only to be trained as interrogators and dropped over Germany at the end of the war! Why hasn't someone in Hollywood made a film of this story? Amazing! Simply amazing!

The Ritchie Boys spotlights certain members who tell the story of their involvement in the group along with family photos and personal gems that are both tearful and enlightening. Fred Howard's story about Marlene Dietrich is wonderful! So Fred!

This is a story you have never heard before. It opens up new vistas to those of us who study the second world war and Germany, in particular.  Of course it was not by accident that I found this film today. Divine intervention for sure! Now, after all these years, I understand why Fred Howard was the character he was. If only I had known back in the 80s when I was his Personal Assistant! It would have made the experience so much richer! What a man! What an incredible story! I loved this film.

NOTE* Since writing this review I have learned that both Fred and his lovely wife have died. He died in his sleep the same day the Bernie Madoff scandal hit the papers. Ever the stock investor, I hope and pray this was not the reason for his death.  If so, add another victim to Madoff's list.",1313452800,13,3288,4.394736842105263
2925284,5,B000UUX2UU,"Few people know about the Ritchie Boys.  More should.  This film tells the story of German Jewish refugees who because of their knowledge of the German language and culture became valuable intelligence gathers during World War II. They Trained at Camp Ritchie in Maryland, and then undertook sometimes dangerous assignments on behalf of their adopted country.  It is a moving story of some unsung heroes of Wrold War II.",1296086400,,420,5.057971014492754
2925285,5,B000UUX2UU,"This documentary is absolutely fabulous! It shows how people who say they never truly were soldiers at heart were able to gather valuable intelligence from German prisoners of war during World War 2 without ever resorting to torture or ill treatment.
It is deeply saddening that this particular skill seems now completely lost. If we think about Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and the cruel techniques we have seen used recently on prisoners of war and the poor results such demeaning 'techniques' have given we cannot help but wonder why the art of collecting intelligence is now practically .... defunct.",1277596800,,598,5.112244897959184
2925286,5,B000UUX2UU,This is a nostalgic and historically important film comprised of present day interviews and films of the period.  It gives a very moving account of these patriotic and extraordinarly brilliant intelligence officers who were forced from their European birthplace in their youth and who found acceptance in their new homeland--the USA.  During WW II their gratitude was expessed by exemplary military service which they carried out without blind vengeance or injustice.,1253664000,2,467,5.563380281690141
2925287,5,B000UUX2UU,"I am buying this for my dad who was in Army Intelligence in WWII and trained many, gifted European POW's as Army Intelligence staff not far from Camp Richie a few years after the war.

This is one of the the best written and certainly most humorous documentary on WWII I have ever seen.  You would love to spend a weekend with the guys in the film just listening to their stories and enjoying their spirit and heart for God, country and others. These are the kind of men that have made America great in he past. May God give us more like them in the days ahead.",1222473600,2,561,4.185185185185185
