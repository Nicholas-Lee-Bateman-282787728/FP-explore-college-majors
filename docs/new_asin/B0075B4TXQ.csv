5057131,5,B0075B4TXQ,"This is truly a good show that is meant for mature and open-minded audience. Some of the things that go on in this show can be a little over the top, but I feel this is what makes it original in it's humor. At first you'll look at the show and be like ""What the hell!?"", give it a season and you'll either be hooked or think it's too much. It's all in your own opinion, just speaking mine.",1361491200,,389,3.9367088607594938

5057134,4,B0075B4TXQ,"I've watched entire series on Hulu and found it quite entertaining. It's super-funny with lots of action and just enough raunchy behavior to keep you coming back for more. Now, the show gets 5 stars, but this set gets 4. It does have plenty of behind-the-scenes features and being an import, it has the original music from the UK broadcast. Because of the 50i format of UK broadcast TV, I had to buy a compatible blu-ray player. Just Google Blu-ray Player 50Hz compatibility and you'll find a page of approved players. I plan on buying more region-free import sets from Amazon.uk so this will pay for itself within a few months. The first two seasons (series) played flawlessly in the new player. But Series 3 had a problem. Disc 1 was on the loading screen for about 5 minutes before ejecting the disc and going back to the home screen. I repeated this a couple of times before turning off the player, turning it back on and trying again. This time, the disc started playing after loading for a couple more minutes. The other discs in Series 3 also take a couple of minutes to load, but does eventually start playing.",1348531200,9,1118,4.567164179104478
5057135,5,B0075B4TXQ,"I was wondering if any of you guys out there have found this box set for Region 1. I absolutely adore this show and am really bummed out that they don't have in available for Region 1.
If the guys find it available for region 1 PLEASE send me a message.

Oh and this show is just brilliant, if you haven't seen it I recommend that you do.",1334361600,5,338,3.9705882352941178

8510500,5,B0075B4TXQ,"Misfits is easily my new favorite show. I had to play the DVDs on my computer due to a ""regional error"", since they came to me from the UK, but other than that I have no complaints.",1393804800,,181,3.918918918918919
8510501,5,B0075B4TXQ,"My daughter requested this series for XMas.  It arrived on time, in perfect condition, and was exactly as advertised.  I would recommend utilizing amazon to my friends and family",1388188800,,178,5.103448275862069
8510502,4,B0075B4TXQ,"Season 1 & 2 are absolutely perfect.  I just started watching season 3, but I can tell the quality has dipped slightly.  Not enough to scare you away from the show as it's still very addictive.",1386028800,,193,4.333333333333333
8510503,5,B0075B4TXQ,"This series is so incredible. I would recommended that any Sci-Fi person watch this. I know its British and that can put some people off but this one is incredible. Its kind of like Chronicle and Attack the Block only better. The whole plot line is incredible. You become attached to all the characters.

I find myself quoting some of the characters. If you watch this you will enjoy it muchly.",1382486400,,394,4.549295774647887
8510504,3,B0075B4TXQ,The blu-ray is supposed to be compatible with western players but it did not work on the US PS3. Fortunately I was able to return the product even though it was opened.,1378166400,2,168,4.28125
8510505,3,B0075B4TXQ,This is a fantastic series! The problem with this set tho is the fact that it doesn't play on all bluray players in America at least.. It isn't region restricted it only plays in bluray players with 50i compatibility if I'm not mistaken. Great purchase I just wish I knew about the 50i issue :),1369267200,4,294,4.363636363636363
8510506,5,B0075B4TXQ,GREAT. I loved having this box set. I live in the U.S. and I was afraid that I would have to buy a separate region unlocked dvd player to watch this. I was going to do it anyway because thats how much I wanted to own this on dvd. But when I played it into my Smasung Blu-Rey player it worked andI couldn't have been more happier!,1367452800,,329,3.925373134328358
8510507,5,B0075B4TXQ,I've heard many rumours that the US market is looking to re-make this awesome UK series. There is No Way they would be able to do this series justice. Do yourself a favour and watch the original version. you will love it!!,1363651200,,222,4.309523809523809
8510508,3,B0075B4TXQ,I made the mistake of purchasing this box set (along with Series 4) on Blu which listed Region ABC on the Product title without doing my research. Just an FYI it will not work on a PS3.  Looking into buying a new Blu Player just for these discs I've bought.,1361750400,12,257,4.14
