8373635,4,B002M9FXW2,"Honored to be the first!!!!!! Just a quick review. Terrible print!! But interesting nonetheless. Interesting scene of Roman legion marching by the sea. Gives indication of militarism of ancient Rome.
Moreover, but I felt a convoluted ending, with characters being mixed up. Maybe I am wrong!!
Finally, provides good companion viewing with Kino's ""Cabiria"" and ""Last Days of Pompei""
Enjoy. Look for other Vista titles: i.e. a silent version of ""Spartacus""!!!!",1418256000,,458,5.464788732394366
