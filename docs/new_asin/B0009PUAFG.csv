2310739,4,B0009PUAFG,"This movie is a must see for anyone. It is one of the most beautiful pieces of film out there.  Though, in this production they spliced in recent footage that breaks the tranquility of the orginal film and gives the true art a comically hokey twinge.  Buy this dvd and watch it with the family, show it to your friends for the sake of all humankind.

2310740,3,B0009PUAFG,"I just loved watching this on PBS and thought my deaf son would greatly enjoy.  I checked on my TV to make sure it was captioned and then placed my order from Amazon for the DVD.  I was terribly disappointed that it is not captioned.  Not sure why that is, but the version shown on PBS was.

The show is just great to watch but loses it's value with no captions.",1111968000,2,362,4.056338028169014
2310741,5,B0009PUAFG,"If you are an ""outdoorsman"", you will find this film truely inspiring. Most of us go out camping or hunting with the camper, hibachi, and a truckload of gear. Or, we go into the BWCA for a week to really ""rough it"". This guy will humble anyone who calls themselves an outdoorsman in this manner. He builds everything he needs from raw material. I spent the whole film watching in awe as he builds a cabin from the ground up, including a rock fireplace. He even carves his own hinges for the door! I couldn't help but list all the talents one must have to truely live without civilization; Master craftsman, farmer, hunter, fisherman, navigator, tracker, butcher, botanist, on, and on. I also was hoping he would expound upon the internal feelings and thoughts of being that isolated. Maybe the book has more of that. I'll have to read that as well. If you love the outdoors, watch this!",1111708800,5,886,4.578616352201258
2310742,5,B0009PUAFG,"I SAW THIS MOVIE ON CPTV (CONNECTICUT PUBLIC TV), AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A BOOK OUT ON THIS, I WOULD SUGGEST SEEING THE MOVIE.  IT IS VERY INTERESTING.  IT SHOWS THAT A MAN CAN SURVIVE ANYTHING IF HE PUTS HIS MIND TO IT.  IT IS A TRUE LIFE MOVIE ON A MAN WHO DECIDES TO LIVE IN THE WILDERNESS IN ALASKA AND HOW HE SURVIVES, IT IS ALL LIVE FOOTAGE.  IT SHOWS SURVIVAL SKILLS TOO.  THIS MOVIE IS TRULY INSPIRING.  SUCH A SHAME HE WAS NOT RECOGNIZED WHILE HE WAS ALIVE.",1110153600,18,465,4.054945054945055
2310743,5,B0009PUAFG,"A story that is hard to believe but in the end you will have a great respect for a true ""individualist"". Amazing details of a man later in life, and his dream, especially when one reads the book of the same title comprised of his journal entries. You want there to be more pictures than the hour presented.",1106352000,13,306,4.293103448275862
2310744,5,B0009PUAFG,"The film follows Richard Proenneke through the seasons of a year, showing his efforts to build a house and live alone in the Alaskan wilderness.  It appears to be composed primarily of original footage shot by Proenneke, often of himself.  As a result, almost all of the shots are still, and many show Proenneke walking away from the camera, presumably because he has just started filming.  Despite this limitation, Proenneke manages to show a great deal of the construction of his house and his explorations of the local area.  This footage is accompanied by a voice-over that I believe are excerpts of Proenneke's contemporary journal, read by the filmmaker, Bob Swerer.  Proenneke's ability to make useful objects from local, raw materials is astounding, and a pleasure to watch.

The film does not explicitly address many of the questions that one might wish to know about the internal experience of life alone in the wilderness, such as how it feels to have only minimal contact with other people.  Instead the film focusses on the external realities that Proenneke faced, leaving me to wonder how I would feel in his situation.  But the slow, mesmerizing pace of the film gave me a quiet feeling of being alone, perhaps addressing some of those questions implicitly.  It is a very unique film, with the words and images of a single person, away from society.  I suspect that it will be of greatest interest to people who have themselves wondered whether they might like to live alone in the wilderness.",1105315200,59,1508,4.87843137254902

2310753,5,B0009PUAFG,Such a great show.  I saw it years ago on PBS telethon and I finally broke down and bought it.  I've watched it several times with different family members.

2310764,5,B0009PUAFG,"This production is music to my overly-urbanized soul.  I can turn it on and feel so much peace from the music and the narrator's soothing voice.  Dick Proenneke lived in a way that humans were probably meant to live if they weren't keen on socializing and pooling resources.  He lived alone in the Alaskan wilderness for years, putting all of his boy scout skills to use.  He always seemed to have plenty, and mother nature was his entertainment.  Highly recommend this to anyone with a love of the outdoors and a desire to connect with nature even vicariously through others.",1492214400,,576,4.72
2310765,5,B0009PUAFG,My husband and I saw this on PBS one night and stayed up watching it!  Now whenever it is on we can't seem to turn it off!

2310766,5,B0009PUAFG,I always enjoyed watching this on PBS with my father growing up when it was on so when I found it on here I had to purchase it. A little expensive but in my opinion it is worth the money as this movie is something I feel everyone should watch at least once. The way this man went at such an older age and was able to carve out a life for himself in a harsh land shows how with the right determination anything is possible. I enjoy watching this movie to fall asleep to as I find his voice and the older movie audio sounds very relaxing. If you have never seen this movie I highly recommend purchasing this and adding it to your winter movie collection as it is a movie I can watch over and over and never grow tired of.,1489708800,,719,4.0

My kids (1st and 4th grade) really liked the Little House books so I was hoping they would enjoy this movie as well. They did! I put it on while we were playing board games but we quickly gave up on the game to watch this story of building an Alaskan wilderness cabin by hand. Very relaxing to watch and no animal violence takes place on screen that might upset tiny viewers. Great documentary for all ages.,1483833600,,506,4.28125

2310793,5,B0009PUAFG,"Saw this on PBS years ago, and was simply fascinated with Dick Proenneke's Alaskan adventure.  It took a very creative engineer and amazing individual to build his lovely little house without help, power tools or modern conveniences, manufacture kitchen tools from used gas cans and wood scraps, and live well there for a very long time.  It was amazing to watch as he set his camera rolling, pursued the task at hand, and then re-set the camera for another activity.  I cannot imagine another person on the face of the planet having the physical strength, adaptability, intelligence, creativity and stamina to do all this man did for so many years.",1462924800,5,649,4.881818181818182

2310810,5,B0009PUAFG,"""Alone in the Wilderness"" is probably the best CD I own.
 I have watched this CD several times and never tire of seeing it.  The author's first chore was to build a cabin that would be tight and sturdy and keep him warm during the winter months in an area that was rarely seen by other humans.  All cut and carved by his efforts, the cabin's pieces are put together from top to bottom.  A neater or better-made cabin you can't hope to have.  My favorite part in the building was the way he made and covered the roof.  Very interesting and pretty, I think, and all made from what he found growing around him.
 It is easy to see that he is very happy with his choice to live virtually alone, depending almost completely upon his ability to survive whatever comes his way using his own skills and efforts.  His contact with the rest of the world appears to mostly be his brother who came to see him no more than once a month and that seeming to be a quick in-and-out trip.  The animals he encounters are beautiful and sometimes funny.  Occasionally showing that we don't actually know as much as we think we do about these wonderful creatures.
 I suggest a cold or rainy night, a cup of your favorite hot drink, a quiet and cozy place to curl up.  No interruptions if possible.  The perfect time to watch this CD. One of the best buys I ever made!  I do hope that you will enjoy this true story as much as I did the first time I had the privilege of seeing it.",1450224000,,1457,4.212996389891697

Proenneke literally arrives in Alaska with nothing but a few tools, some food and a camera and sets out to document his new life. From building his log cabin, to making his own tools to dealing with the wildlife and gathering food it is simply amazing and, above all else, TRUE!

2310885,5,B0009PUAFG,"I saw a part of this movie on PBS as a kid and was fascinated by it. I caught the show right in the middle though and had to leave before seeing the ending credits. I never knew the name of the film, but I always remembered the images and story. Flash forward 10+ years (I'm 27 now) and while browsing bushcraft and survival themed YouTube videos I saw a suggested video thumbnail that I immediately recognized.

Since then, I have watched part one and part two at least 30+ times. These movies are truly inspiring and wholesome. Every time I watch them I am motivated to be a little harder working, to take more pride in what I do, and more focused on making my life exactly what I want it to be. I just love these movies so much. I constantly have them on my iPad to watch whenever I find myself with some down time. There have been many plane rides or lunch breaks where I end up talking about My personal hero, Dick Proenneke.  It's sad how our culture has changed and how much knowledge, skill, pride, and self reliance we have lost. These documentaries stand as a stark contrast to the direction in life we are all herded into these days.

These series of documentaries are truly priceless, a wonderful gift, and great entertainment for any age.",1391299200,5,1251,4.383620689655173

2310888,5,B0009PUAFG,"Loved it!  We went to Alaska in June 2013 so this was so interesting to us. The ingenuity and perseverance is incredible! A story for all the family to enjoy at a time when ""dealing"" with  life doesn't seem to be an option, showing that it's about what you need and not what you want. You do not need a lot to live.

It is nice to see a good quality relaxing documentary that is not staged and full of a bunch of marketing garbage. Dick Proenneke built his cabin from scratch, even crafted his own utensils and lived in the wilderness for over 30 years. Not to mention he did most of the real building when he was in his 50's!

2310896,5,B0009PUAFG,"I saw this film on PBS about ten years ago, and have thought about it many times. I mean, what little boy doesn't dream of building his own cabin out in the woods? And what man still wonders if he could, given the opportunity.

Well, now I have a friend, in his late 20s, who just bought a piece of property and is planning to build his own cabin to live in, much as Richard Proenneke did in Alaska in 1968. My friend is inspired and influenced by this film and the accompanying book, and he gladly loaned it to me to watch.

I was as inspired by this film the second time around, and now I'd like to read the book to find out ""the rest of the story.""

There is much to appreciate here, but probably most inspiring to me is the way Proenneke gathers his materials, constructs his tools and builds his cabin. He is obviously a master carpenter putting together a lifetime of skills (while in his 50s) in the remote wilderness of Alaska. Even his self-filming techniques are interesting, especially in this day of people taking ""selfless"" all the time.

I highly recommend this film to those who love the outdoors in general, Alaska in particular, or who can appreciate a man who pursues his dream to live a life of self-sufficiency.",1387584000,3,1231,4.409691629955947

It wasn't that the movie was boring it was just so calming and relaxing we nodded off! We watched it again and left it in the DVD player because we want it there for decompression time.

I bought Part 2 and it was equally enjoyable there was a lot of re view of the first in it with a decent amount of new scenes.

It a cute production, a lot is shot himself on old (9mm ?) which is no HD but it has a wonderful quality, and it is interspersed with the occasional slightly more modern footage of wildlife to augment the narrative (he narrates it from his original diary).

His journey and skills are incredible, let alone the landscape and wildlife (Alaskan mountains and lakes, caribou, wolverines and pine martins), and it really captures a time gone by. But also this mans independence and strength is clearly demonstrated which is a strong message to anyone about self reliance and the simplicity and beauty of a life 'out of the system' and in with nature.

It really is simply a film on a disk, no bonus features or options, no 7.1 surround, not feature length, just a simple film of a comfortable length (60 mins).

Filmed in the 1960s, it shows a man secure enough in his own capabilities to not only stake his life on them, but to spend every bit of remaining energy on a painstakingly complete document of the process. Like an ancient Youtube vlogger, Proenneke rolls 8mm footage of himself hunting, canoeing, interacting with potentially dangerous wildlife and building an astoundingly cushy log cabin from nothing more than natural materials, then overdubs his own narration track to boot. With a warm, familiar personality and a straightforward, no-doubts conviction, he's one half Bob Ross and the other half Les Stroud, decades before either came to prominence.

I will say this... Here is the very real manifestation of what so many of us dream about, but so very few will ever actually go and do. Also worth noting that if we were to define ""Rustic Carpentry Genius"" in comparative terms, Mr. Proenneke would be the Albert Einstein. I look around the world I live in and see virtually no one who has these kinds of skills anymore. I imagine that at one time, many men knew how to do this sort of thing- maybe not quite to Mr. Proenneke's level of mind-boggling proficiency, but at least the basics... These days, we're just such a different breed of people and not necessarily better off for it. In watching the movie, you're at once reminded of not only your dreams, but also your limitations. Franky put, Mr. Proenneke was a very rare bird- the sort of man who had the work ethic of a mule and took genuine pleasure engaging in hard, productive labor. The sort of guy who preferred Alaskan Winter to Alaskan Summer (he said this in the film). There's no doubt, this man was cut from a very different cloth.

life alone in absolutely the most beautiful place in the world, this dvd will put
you there.  I have the book, which has been my winter read now for several years.
Between reading this book several times and having friends living in Alaska, I decided I had to purchase the dvd to actually see through this man's eyes, exactly
everything in detail, that he seen and accomplished.
  It is absolutely amazing.  I have had the video for three days and have watched it each day....it takes you through building his cabin, which  had logs in place up to roof edge in 10 days, with nothing but hand tools.  Very few men could
even begin to accomplish this today, especially alone and with no modern tools.
He canoe's through miles of beautiful lake front which also has great fishing.
When he slips the canoe into the water, you will see some of the most
beautiful, serene background that will just about take your breath away.
  It is hard to actually describe everything in this dvd, creating his own furniture from scratch, down to making a spoon for his sourdough pancakes to creating bowls.  It shows picking mountain blueberries and one scene shows taking wild cranberries and making his own syrup.
 He makes friends with birds and some animals by providing meat scraps during the long months of snow and ice.  If you are a hunter or animal lover, you will
definitely appreciate the many scenes that are often so close you can count the
hair above their eye's.  There are both caribou and moose with racks that are huge.  One caribou has a rack that looks the same height as its own body.  Even makes you wonder how in the world he could carry such a rack.  There are bear with cubs, mountain sheep with full curl horns, wolves, beaver and even one
huge wolverine playing in the snow and rolling down a long slope.
 He picked beautiful flat stones up and down his many lake trips and created a
fantastic stone fireplace.  One scene in the film does show him sitting beside it with a fire going.  It looks so warm, when you consider, that just outside, the
snow is almost to the edge of the roof.
  He creates a huge wooden sled for hauling over the snow and ice, just out of
spruce boughs.
  This man did more physical work in one 10 day period while constructing his
cabin, than most men would do in a one year period.  He spent 35 years in the wilderness, absolutely alone, except for the occasional visit by plane, of a friend that would re-supply some of his basic food needs, such as flour, sugar, etc.,  In 1998 at the age of 82 years, he could no longer stand the 50 degree below temperature and turned his wonderful creation over to the Lake Clark National Park.
  As said, I have make his book a yearly winter read and now with the dvd, I can
relive his time spent there.  What a fantastic creation this man made for
other people to enjoy.",1295740800,4,2927,4.453007518796992

2310962,4,B0009PUAFG,"Fascinating account of how a man embraced the wilderness and made it his lifestyle. He never says we have too many things; he merely shows the contentment when you don't have them. A former diesel engineer, briefly intrigued by the thought of building his own log cabin in Alaska, easily does so and finds himself so much at peace with his environment that he makes it his world for the rest of his life.  [...]",1280620800,,411,4.48
2310963,4,B0009PUAFG,"The work -- carrying sand and gravel, cutting trees, poles, moss, etc. for his cabin -- is impressive enough, but the cutting of boards from logs for the window frames and doors with a hand saw, making hinges from Spruce roots, and even a wooden lock for the door, produces at first admiration and then a sort of awe. He also makes the furniture, fireplace (with stones he collects from far and wide), spoons and bowls. He makes a fridge in the permafrost and takes temperatures on a warm day to show the contrast.

I thought about the planning involved in both the design of the cabin, and in the securing of supplies for his garden and to carry him through the winter. Then I factored in the solo filming of it all, which I know from experience, is time consuming and requires some thought and expertise.
The shots of wildlife in the area around his cabin are impressive and I forgot most of the time that the shots of himself had been carefully staged. And it all comes off rather matter-of-factly as if it is no big deal, just a guy having a little bit of fun.

Of course he hunted (including dressing and butchery) and smokes a variety of animals, tans sheep skin, and grows a respectable garden -- in Alaska.

The last few minutes of the film indicates that he went on to live in the cabin for 35 years, but does not indicate how he developed and edited the film, what he did for money (I presume trapping?) or how he replenished his tools and gear. He was a mechanic prior to heading out there, but did he come back to civilization for money? Perhaps the book gives more details.

I am not a builder, or particularly adept with my hands, but this film really reveals what it takes to survive in the wilderness -- skill with your hands AND brains. He must have practiced a fair bit before heading out; no one can just cut a long board by hand with a rip saw without some practice (and he obviously knew how to keep his tools sharp). So what we are getting is the culmination of a life's experience and learning. At 51 he had what it took to make both a life and a film to be proud of.

We may not all be builders, but all of us, by the 50 year mark or so, have amassed a certain body of knowledge and skills to allow us to create our own masterwork. In the end this is the strength of the film, it is not only ""mesmerizing"" as so many reviewers have said, but also inspiring.

What are you waiting for, get out and make your own metaphorical cabin in the woods!",1280620800,8,2467,4.249466950959488

The only thing you don't get with it are the breaks where you might get little bits of conversation and little known details or stories that Mr. Proenneke told over the years to his family & friends.

But, this is totally worth the price of this DVD.  It's good quality, although the colors are muted just as they were from the original old film shot in Alaska.  In my opinion, it adds to the charm of the whole thing.  I just wish I was sturdy enough to try to live this life for myself!",1276905600,,623,4.032520325203252

2310968,5,B0009PUAFG,"What can I say but watching this is best done when you get peace form the wife/kids/dog etc.

First lets get the technical bit out of the way, the DVD is sold in NTSC (yankee) format and we use PAL in good ole blighty. But when I stuck this in my DVD player it works fine! It also plays fine on the PC, so you won't have any issue watching it and you won't need any fancy multi standard players/TV's.

Ok, now the subject matter, it's about this guy Richard Proenneke who goes off to live in the wilds of Alaska Now as you might imagine, Bovis/Wimpy/Laings etc haven't got there yet so he has to build his own house to start with.

This turns out to be a log cabin watch as he chops out the logs and builds this from the ground to the roof, all the time watching out for bears, fishing for his dinner and doing a bit of the amateur naturalist.
There is a commentary by one of his friends Bob Swerer, which really goes well with the film. So whether you are into woodwork on a large scale, watching nature or survivalism then there is something here for you. I would rcommend you buy the book and read it, most of the commentary comes directly from it and you get a fuller picture of his life there and some excellent glossy photos too.

It's every outdoorsy hermit's dream! The DVD is great and the book that is also available is really good too. I recommend the video if you want some good entertainment or some encouragement to get ""off the grid"" and build your own cabin. (All by hand!)",1268179200,,617,4.669724770642202

Watching the solace of a humble man choosing to survive in the Alaskan wilderness; building his log cabin, all his necessities,  digging a fridge and freezer underground, hanging his meat in the trees, passively teaching you everything it takes for survival. The movie earns its worth by just watching him carve with his axe - unbelievably skillful.  Sharing his relationship  and respect for nature is an amazing gift and a  beautiful experience for anyone.  I was so pleased when my 24 year old son was blown away by it.

It is totally motivating for anyone wanting to get away to Alaska and build a cabin and live in the wilderness.  I have watched this movie at least 20 times - and I can rarely stand to see a movie more then twice... it puts me in a great mood and motivates me to get up and do something on a really grand scale.

If it were on VHS, it probably would have worn through by now.  I find it to be very invigorating, that this man left civilization as he knew it to live in the wilds of Alaska for one year.  Of course he stayed a lot longer.  His details of what and how he did them, make you want to be there too.  After watching the video several times, I was curious about all of the details they don't show, so I bought and read it as well.  I highly recommend both.",1251072000,,597,4.094827586206897

Is it Boring to watch a man building a cabin, hiking through the woods, filming wildlife, living day-to-day? On paper it sounds that way but you find yourself entranced nonetheless. It is worthy of the book and incredibly relaxing to watch. Proenneke's skill and Know-how is amazing. The seeming ease in which he builds and goes about his daily routine is awesome in it's own sense, yet talented people make things look easy and we all know that this was no mean feat. His love of nature and of the land shows through. There are many scenes of the landscape and wildlife that left even my active ,two yr old daughter mesmerized(you would have thought that Barney was on)
Just like the book, the film preaches(without preaching) the message: work hard, be self reliant, respect the world around you...ECT. Highly recommended to young and old and to families.

2310984,5,B0009PUAFG,"Alone in the Wilderness is a collection of film footage captured by Dick Proenneke, as he roughed it in the wilds of Alaska. The film documents his settlement and construction of a log cabin in Twin Lakes, and is narrated by Bob Swerer using Dick's own journals that he kept during that time.

This guy was amazing. One easily forgiven male chauvinistic remark aside, the documentary presents us with a very capable, impressive human being. Watch as Dick strips trees to form his cabin logs, notches each one for a perfect fit, then proceeds to build the cabin, roof it, build clever hinges out of nothing but wood, and even more. Quite ingenious.

Aside from filming his progress on the cabin, Dick also documented his adventures as he explored the nearby wilderness, encountering bears, sheep, caribou, and even a comical wolverine.

Other documentaries on Dick Proenneke are available as well, I'll probably buy them, and you might even get a kick out of Bob Swerer's CD ""You Don't Know Me"" which showcases his colorful singing voice.

His skills and his love of nature are unquestionable; he was truly an admirable person.  After viewing the program several times, and seeing the solitude in which he lived his life, I couldn't help but to also feel a little sad.  Did he pass his skills on to anyone?  Were his talents lost to the world when he died?  Did he ever have a meaningful relationship with another person during all of those years?  I understand that it was his life and that he was living his dream, not mine or anyone elses.  But, I can't help but think about what this great man could have taught and shared with others.

When I first watched it I had no idea that it was just home videos that were shot to document this fascinating man's odyssey. This is true reality TV and like one of the campaign relations hosts said on WHYY recently, ""reality TV on broadcast TV is about as real as a $3 bill.""

Mr. Richard Proenneke was an extraordinary hunter, camper, farmer and all-around outdoors man. I could never imagine how even a group of men could do half of what he did. What I also enjoy and take from this film is the simple element of it. There were no bells and whistles, it's just an educational film that is also very entertaining because Mr. Proenneke  did all the things that most of us wish we could do but never have the opportunity.",1229299200,,823,4.303225806451613

Everything about this DVD is pure relaxation and meditation, and we watch in complete fascination as this man builds a cabin by hand before a magnificent backdrop of mountains, water, and sky, and explores the land around him while living on his own. The wildlife footage is fantastic, as is the soundtrack, and narration by Bob Swerer. All of it is soothing and peaceful -- it is true nourishment for the soul. My 4 year old daughter talks about Mr. Proenneke all the time, and about building her own cabin in ""a different wilderness"" (her words), and says to me with the true earnesty of a 4 yr old ""Mama, I love Dick Proenneke."" To which I say, ""I know sweetheart, I do too."" We watch this A LOT, and I never tire of it. It is a beautiful testament to living in complete rhythm with life, and being satisfied with being.

It seems like a little piece of the 50's, and very authentic. However, DO NOT BUY the companion DVD: ""THE FROZEN NORTH."" It's much the same video from Alone in the Wilderness, with much of the exact same narration, but the narration is entirely unintelligible. It's Dick Proenneke's own narration, I believe, but save yourself the disappointment--his microphone, and his delivery make him sound almost retarded--and most of it is literally unintelligible. It was a colossal disappointment, and I love the first film. To say the second DVD is a rip-off is an understatement: Bob Swerer Productions should be ashamed to sell it.

2311000,5,B0009PUAFG,"There are a lot of great reviews here and I don't think enough can be said about Dick and his life.  It's interesting to read all the reviews and see what other people's perspectives are and how his life has inspired them.  The things that stood out for me is Dicks self discipline, work ethic and values.  I highly recommend watching the video first and then reading the book (One Mans Wilderness).  The video was made off the 1972 best selling book but helps you visualize Dick's daily activities as you read.  The book fills in all the holes that you miss in the video; they definitely go together well.  Dick reminds us (me) about keeping priorities straight, specifically what a person needs versus what a person wants.  I have been guilty of allowing my ""wants"" in life dominate me at times and not keeping things in perspective.  Dick's life serves as a reminder to me that all people ""need"" shelter, nutrition and good physical and mental health; everything else is a want.  Hard work and accomplishing something with your own hands is one of the best rewards a person can give to themselves.

This video is watched almost everyday in our house.  My wife and son watch it too and it never gets old.  There is a peace to it that you'll never get from TV.  I made the mistake (not really) of loaning it to a friend who has watched it with his boys more than 20 times in the past couple of weeks.  I can't imagine too many people that would not gain something from this and Dick's legacy.

Don't pass up the opportunity this video offers.  I would love to see this expanded on and learn more about Dick and his life prior to his first full year in Alaska (1968).  I welcome one of our era's great movie directors/producers get a hold of this, do the research and accurately put his life on the big screen for all to cherish.",1203638400,,1829,4.411940298507463

This is a great video to own for anyone who loves the great wilderness outdoors, and for those who appreciate ""things made by hand."" Proenneke was ""one of a kind,"" and one to learn from.

He wants to find Mr. Proenneke's cabin, now preserved for public use and historic purposes, and go there for his 50th birthday to spend a couple of weeks at least.

2311015,5,B0009PUAFG,"Dick Proenneke almost lost his eyesight after some diesel fuel splashed into his eyes while on the job.  That was in the early 1960's.  So, he decided that, while he still could, he would take his brains and brawn into the Alaskan wilderness to see if he could carve out a life for himself in some of the harshest conditions imaginable.  Fortunately for us, he brought along a little 8mm film camera to film some of his exploits, and he also kept a daily journal.  35 years later, at the age of 82, he decided that he had proven himself and left his little slice of paradise behind.  Those minus-forty degree temperatures in the height of winter get a little tough for the old bones.

The result of Dick's little film clips and his journal is the documentary, ""Alone in the Wilderness.""  Much of the hour-long DVD is given over to clips of Dick building perhaps the perfect log cabin with his own two hands - even making his own tools.  Even a master carpenter would have to feel a little inadequate watching Dick cut his own lumber, carry logs over one shoulder, build a fireplace and chimney, and even use Alaska's natural permafrost to create his own refrigerator!  This is all after Dick makes several of his own tools - truly amazing.

Other segments of the film are simple explorations of the wilderness by Dick and his camera.  Look for some amazing shots of fish, moose, bear, mountain goats, wolves, and most charmingly, a wolverine playing slip-and-slide down a snowy slope.  Proenneke's journals are read in voiceovers by the filmmakers, and he writes with a plain Iowa sensibility (""Winter comes on, quick as a broken shoelace.""

This is back-to-basics filmmaking about a back-to-basics man.  Yet through this simple film perhaps the simplest questions are asked and answered - how much does a man need, how much can a man withstand, and how much of our modern-day baggage is really all that necessary.  The answers are, in order, not much, a lot, and very little.  An excellent film.",1172448000,28,1996,4.692528735632184

In 1968,One man, Dick Proenneke actually did it and luckily for us he took his cameras and diary with him. Proenneke was a tough guy with a gentle humor and an almost poetic love of nature. He built his own cabin, hunted, fished, planted and watched the wildlife go by. He lived like this for 30 years and only left because at 80 something he felt like he was slowing down a bit.

After watching for only a few minutes I was struck by how much you need to know in order to survive in the wild for even a few days. Proenneke was a carpenter and mason and had a good knowlege of science. His  idea for a ""refrigerator"" probably would never occur to most of us today. I only wish the documentary could've been longer. The life of Dick Proenneke was really remarkable. I plan to get the book that goes along with the film. If you love the TV show Survivorman (I do) then Alone in the Wilderness is perfect for you.",1140912000,28,994,4.226315789473684
2311022,5,B0009PUAFG,"This film is technically excellent, but there is an old timey ""feel"" to it, reminding me of ""educational"" films (narrated by the incomparable Alexander Scorby) I saw as a boy sitting in darkened grade-school classrooms, while other kids passed notes and whispered and giggled.

The narrator of Alone in the Wilderness, Bob Swerer, is also incomparable, and for me makes the film more than the sum of its parts. Swerer's hauntingly intimate and intelligently hokey voice is in the first person, the script taken from the journals of Dick Proenneke. Once you hear Swerer's voice you can't get it out of your head.

""Survivalists"" would be more interested in the hunting, fishing, and canoeing aspects of Proenneke's 24 year adventure, and the lake itself looms large, but the film is most profoundly a lesson in Proenneke's extraordinary woodworking using simple hand tools. You are taken step by step, though not painstakingly, through the construction of the cabin. These are not primitive, ""heritage"" tools--Proenneke lacks no kind of saw, for example. The ""stars"" of This Old House might take note of the degree of fit and finish Proenneke brings to his little cabin and hearth--nothing less than amazing. A brief shot of meat frying in a pan, and an array of condiments, shows that Proenneke, thanks to the seaplane visting every so often, did not lack certain amenities of civilization, such as Tabasco sauce.",1138665600,7,1413,5.060085836909871
2311023,5,B0009PUAFG,"This film saved me alot of time and money. I'd always had a dream to do this. It's one thing to leave everything, when there wasn't much to leave, but this man left modern convenience behind. He left TV, radio and telephone. He left everything that we take for granted in our lives, everything that everyone can't live without. He didn't take bug spray! He didn't even have a dog! The lure of freedom is enormous. Most people want what this man got in some form or another, but the price tag for most is way too high. In todays world, you could buy this kind of freedom, but once you get channeled by ""the system"" you become hardened, and are conditioned by the rules and regulations invented by man. Todays environment preaches hard-work and structure to ""get ahead"". To chuck-it-all would be an embarassment in the eyes of peers and family, and therefore we are all victims of our own environments and self-made realities (no matter how much money we have). What this man did was not easy, just think about what he had to leave, what he had give up, and once so, could never go back. Those cold -80 nights and -40 days. It's amazing he did it, and us viewers not knowing what he left behind. What were the motivators? We can only speculate. But for anyone who's ever experienced a BAD camping trip, and know how miserable it is to be wet, cold and dirty.. what this man did was nothing short of amazing, and I could watch it over and over.",1133740800,64,1441,4.400749063670412
2311024,5,B0009PUAFG,"When you first see this movie you will probably think it was shot for the movie theatres but it is really just one guy with a camera documenting his adventure in the wilderness. Little did he know he did such a great job it rivals what is released today in both quality and interest.

You will also be amazed at how easy he makes it seem to live alone in the wilderness, building a cabin and surviving through very cold temperatures, and along the way documenting things such as air and water temperatures, ice depths, animal movements, etc. He also shows how he built things he needed like a spoon and sled, also how he found food and kept warm through the winter.

And the beauty of the area is astounding! No wonder he picked it for a location to live, a nice lake and mountain range, he shows the surrounding area as well, climbing to the highest peaks to film.

The only drawback here is the film is too short, apparently he filmed much more but most was lost due to deterioration of the movie reels. What is left here is a real gem, a must for anyone that loves nature. Great narration caps it off, a real treat for all.",1133481600,89,1126,4.30188679245283
2311025,4,B0009PUAFG,"This is a great and amazing story.  Just the fact that Proenneke accompolished his goal of forging a life in the wilderness is amazing and fascinating.  But watching him do it is really a treat.  The cinematography is spectacular, and even more so when you think that he shot this by himself on cameras he back-packed in, in color, in 1968!!  And to tell the truth, what we see him do would be hard to believe- if we weren't watching him do it.

Whether it's Alaska's vistas, Proenneke's series of astonishing accomplishments, the wildlife of Twin Lakes, or the fact that this was filmed in 68 and looks so good, Every frame is worth watching a few times.  There's so much packed into this movie, that it's kind of amazing in itself.",1133308800,34,733,4.515151515151516
2311026,5,B0009PUAFG,"I bought the DVD because when I saw this on PBS I was simply mesmerized by it's simple and calm beauty.  True, the skills Dick had and the way he built tools and his cabin was very cool, but I thought the greatest part of the film was his love for nature.  Even though he had to shoot and eat a Ram, he still felt bad for the old guy.  The little clip of the wolverine rolling down the snowy hill was unreal.  I love wolverines!!! The only part I did not like was the ending narration by the woman, who said something to the effect that his spirit will live on in the perfect notches of his logs.  Wrong!  It lives on in that beautiful Alaskan boreal wilderness called Twin Lakes...the moss, the spruce trees, the blueberry bushes, all the mountains and lakes, and the animals.",1127779200,120,777,4.2517006802721085
2311027,5,B0009PUAFG,"This movie protrays a craftsman who wanted to make a difference in his own life.  By doing so, he has inspired many others to know that they can live without depending on a lot of people or government.",1127088000,8,201,4.2894736842105265
2311028,5,B0009PUAFG,"I saw this adventure on PBS last evening and wished I had the courage and talent to do what this brave soul did.  He did have a few things from the modern world: staple groceries (flour, salt, sugar), plastic lining for the roof of his hand made cabin, (which he laments using) cement for his cabin's chimney, and a gun for protection and food, but for the most part he is alone except for God and the wild animals.....he didn't even have a dog or cat for company!  What a blessing to see that someone can live an ongoing dream for over 35 years.  You must see this.",1121817600,,566,4.222222222222222
2311029,5,B0009PUAFG,"Haven't we all thought, ""Gee, it would be nice to live a simpler life, somewhere out in the woods, away from the world . . .""?  This film documents a man's journey into the Alaskan wilderness, where he builds his own cabin, fishes and forages for food, and uses common-sense ingenuity to overcome the challenges of daily life.  I agree with another reviewer: This film does not preach-- However, it gently teaches that ""the simple life"" is full of hard, yet rewarding, work.  The film's pace is mesmerizingly slow, with grainy old-fashioned photography and a soothing narrative by its subject, Dick Proenneke.  It's incredible to imagine that he lived ""alone in the wilderness"" like this for over 30 years.",1120608000,19,706,4.907563025210084
2311030,5,B0009PUAFG,"I left Colorado's light several days ago to work in hazy Los Angeles.  The drive out is always a reminder of what I am leaving, as the intimidatingly enormous 14ers (like Gray's Peak) loom over I-70 -- almost daring me to leave -- slowly disintegrate into staggered planes and red rock plateaus, in turn losing their scorched colors and fading into a clay-type desert.  It is here I feel really alone.

In the motel during my night-over in Utah, I watched Alone in the Wilderness.  I had missed the first few minutes, but wasn't paying attention much.  What caught my eye right off the bat was the color.  Films don't look like this today, they are all cartoony, over-saturated digital oilslicks.  Wilderness was grainy, faded, low-contrast, and quite remarkable to watch, until I realized what was going on, really noticed what the film was about.

Here was a man, who left his job to live secluded from the (technological) world.  He built a cabin without disturbing the trees directly around his plot.  He eventually added a beautiful chimney, made of stones collected throughout various hikes at varying altitudes.  He built snowshoes and a dog-sled (despite the lack of dogs), and a backpack that could carry anything (slab of wood for a table top, or nearly an entire caribou).  At one point, he needs a wooden spoon, so -- where today we would hop in the car, drive through traffic to a store and purchase one -- he carves a wonderful spoon out of wood, polished and perfected and filmed in less than an hour.

I couldn't help but wonder if this film was a godsend; am I doing the right thing moving away from the mountains, where I am constantly outdoors in the sunshine?  In California, I spend my days indoors, looking out into traffic, and usually I'm too busy to care.  In the evenings, I have headaches, and easily become grumpy.

What is it we want in life?  Alone in the Wilderness does not preach ""leave the complex, live for simplicity.""  The film doesn't preach at all, in fact.  The viewer simply watches this man's life, which is a far cry from ""simple,"" by the way; it is constant work to stay warm and well-fed.  The dangers of the surrounding wildlife isn't far from Mr. Proenneke's walls of comfort.  In one hilarious moment, though, Mr. Proenneke turns the camera onto a wolverine that had been avoiding him, only to capture it rolling (literally sprawled out, rolling!) down a huge snowy hillside, enjoying the powdery snow and the bright sunshine.

At my young age, I must do what I feel is right for me.  But that doesn't mean I can't put this disc in the player and vicariously live through a man far more brave and happy than I could ever be.",1118793600,349,2672,4.614406779661017
2311031,5,B0009PUAFG,"Alone in the Wilderness was a PBS special that won the hearts of our family.  The story is an unbelievable one that had our jaws dropping most of the time.  What this man accomplished by himself, building a log cabin by hand with no help and so precisely, was truly astonishing.  This story is funny, heartwarming and a must have for anyone who loves the outdoors!",1118707200,22,364,4.484848484848484
2311032,5,B0009PUAFG,"I saw this documentary on a local PBS station.  A truly compelling story about a man, at age 47, who goes into the wilderness of Alaska and lives in solitude for the next 35 years.  At age 82, he decides the 50 below degree winters are getting to be a bit hard on him.  The DVD documents his life in the wilderness, his thoughts, his very innovative woodworking and much more.  A very fascinating story for those interested in the human will to endure and face the challenges of nature.",1118102400,20,486,4.366666666666666
2311033,5,B0009PUAFG,"Nothing short of awe-inspiring!

This hand-crafted one-man production leaves ""reality"" programming in the dust.

Proenneke is superb as humble director, camerahand and narrator rolled into one through four seasons of life alone in the Alaskan wilderness.

Around 1968, at age 51, Proenneke suffers a life-changing industrial accident and departs the lowever 48. Single handedly, he builds a new home and life in the breathtaking but remote Alaskan bush.

We watch in amazement as Proenneke - by hand alone - constructs the historically solitary home that shelters him for decades and now stands preserved as a National Park tribute to him.

Thers are no power machines, not motorized equipment and only basic hand tools.  The rest is left to Proenneke's incredible hard labor and ingenuity.  His fascinating narration takes us through every step.

Long before there was ""Survivor,"" there was Proenneke.  There is the real McCoy.",1114732800,4,928,5.344827586206897
