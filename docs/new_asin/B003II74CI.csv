8397394,5,B003II74CI,There  are  10  DVDs  and  so  far  I  have  had  time  to  watch  three  of  them.  They  are  excellent  value.  The  filming  and  sound  are  very  good  and  Kleiber  has  to  be  one  of  the  greatest  conductors  of  all  time.  His  conducting  is  poetic.,1355270400,,265,4.068181818181818

8397396,5,B003II74CI,"This may be my favorite DVD box set. It's amazing. Boy oh boy did Kleiber have a lot of charm and insight and charisma -- the New Years Concerts are splendid, the Brahms symphonies are power-houses, the Beethoven symphonies are incredibly vivid, and the operas are all top notch. Most highly recommended.",1287273600,13,304,4.865384615384615
