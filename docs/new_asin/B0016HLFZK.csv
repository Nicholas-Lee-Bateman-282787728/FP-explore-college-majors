8262573,5,B0016HLFZK,"COLD WAR BELOW is the 3rd in a series of DVD films by Periscope Films delivering authentic US Naval training and promotional films. In this DVD format, you'll learn about the development of the missiles that lead to the Polaris program. Starting with the BAT in 1945, the Regulus and the Polaris, this historic footage will keep you on the edge of your seat.

In 1960, the development of the Polaris was complete and submarine platform for launching them. The first Fleet Ballistic submarine (FBM) was deployed in 1961 in Submarine Squadron 14. This fleet was eventually expanded to 41 boats and deployed worldwide insuring peace as a deterrent to war. You'll learn about the men of the Blue and Gold crews that manned them, how they endured the 60 day patrols and the training they received while in port.

Included is the exploits of the USS Sea Dragon and it's Artic expedition. It's mission was to find a passage from the Atlantic to Pacific oceans including going under the North Pole. This secret mission is documented in this segment. This was a very dangerous voyage as no one had ever attempted to sail under this ice cap.

If you are a seasoned submariner or and interested historian, you'll find this DVD to be exciting and educational as an addition to your collection.",1131062400,10,1281,4.73542600896861
8262574,5,B0016HLFZK,"""The Cold War Below"" is Volume 3 in Periscope Film's series of historic submarine documentary and training films, and in my opinion it may be the most outstanding one.  Of course I'm biased because I spent most of my career on a boomer and this disc is chuck full of missile boats.

It features a bunch of rare films including two that profile the Polaris FBMs -- that's fleet ballistic missile submarines for those of you lubbers.  For me just watching this is a real time warp -- especially seeing the old ""poopie suit"" uniforms we used to have to wear on the James Polk!  If you ever wanted to show your wife or kids what life was like aboard one of the '41 for Freedom' this is a great way to do it.

There's truly some outstanding memories locked up in these films, and I should know because I watched them twice the day I got them.  In addition to the Polaris films, there's a film that shows the Regulus II supersonic cruise missile, which was the bird the Navy would have gotten if Hyman Rickover and Red Raborn had failed to deliver on Polaris.  I did not realize how close to operational the Reg II really was -- this film even shows it launched from the submarine USS Grayback.  Pretty freaking neat!

Finally, a real treat, there are two films on the disc about the USS Seadragon.  This was a very storied nuke boat.  The first film has an interview about the Seadragon's trip underneath the ice through the Northwest Passage -- something that made headlines during the Cold War.  I especially liked the boat's commander speaking directly to the Russians, errr, camera,  ""Now that we've been up there, we intend to stay there.""  Well we did!

Anyway, the last film on the disc is the most poignant, a home movie made by a crewman on the Seadragon and narrated by the C.O. Tom Jacobs.  It's hard to believe they made something like this considering how us submariners are known as the silent service, but they did.  I figured this would be a very primitive, very cheesy film but I found it to be very real and actually moving because of the comraderie you see on board the boat.  Heck,  I remember similar scenes from my own career.  When I got my dolphins finally pinned on, I was very proud.  Then my friends threw me into Pearl Harbor, and I was very proud and very very wet.

Anyway, this disc will give you a glimpse into a whole lost era in the submarine navy's history, one you probably never heard much about.  All in all, an outstanding DVD well worth the price of admission.",1130889600,14,2495,4.423245614035087
