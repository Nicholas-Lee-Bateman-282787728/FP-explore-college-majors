2911817,4,B000TYWW80,Hey Mikey what is your head for? Nothing your as smart as a 2x4! Love the design skills and the rides.,1370908800,,102,3.9047619047619047
2911818,5,B000TYWW80,I really like the show American Chopper. You need to get Season 7 and on. You get how ever many words I write and if that a problem I won't do anymore of these !!!!,1367107200,,164,3.7142857142857144
2911819,5,B000TYWW80,"Yes, the DVD did not have a menu like seasons 1, 2 & 3.  I wish the video would fill the whole screen.  The visual quality is good though and just to watch the episodes is great.  Like the others who have rated Season 4 and beyond I wish the Discovery Channel would have made these.",1363996800,,282,4.0
2911820,4,B000TYWW80,I gave this DVD as a birthday gift~ I haven't heard back from the recipient.  I hope he likes it.,1363478400,,97,3.85
2911821,2,B000TYWW80,"I really enjoyed the comments of both parts of season 4 of American Chopper. I agree $5 per episode is expensive.  You can download season 4 per episode for $1.99 from iTunes, a software program from Apple.  There are 20 episodes of this season that you can download.  You could also buy Amazon instant video season 4 of 24 episodes for $29.95 or $1.99 per episode.  This will put it in your digital library that you can watch when you are on Amazon.con online only.",1312070400,2,466,4.447058823529412
2911822,1,B000TYWW80,"I bought the first three seasons of American Chopper. They were complete seasons. I will watch the rest in reruns, or if they show up online. Nobody gets my hard earned money twice for one season of any show. If these seasons of the show get released in a legit set--one season, one set--I will probably buy it.",1288051200,3,311,4.379310344827586
2911823,3,B000TYWW80,"This was kind of a let-down because I didn't realize they split up the seasons into two parts to get more money.  I didn't mind paying $30 or $40 per season, but now I think they're just getting greedy.",1261353600,3,202,4.17948717948718
2911824,2,B000TYWW80,"The dvds are definitely manufactured by someone different than the first 3 seasons.  The dvds are really bad in the fact that they are out of order on the disc (episode wise).  I also had a disc arrive that did not even work.  The best part is that the cheap producers did not use any anti-burning techniques, so you can burn / copy them all you want.  Might save you some money if you don't want to pay the 30 bucks per set.  I would ask around if I were you before buying.

On a good note, the show is still excellent and provides lots of entertainment.  I love American Choppers.  I just hope they choose a better company next time to release the dvds, just for their sake, because pirating is going to be an issue with seasons 4-5-6 (which I bought).",1202860800,8,754,4.223776223776224
2911825,3,B000TYWW80,"has no extra features like some of the other seasons I've gotten. Almost has a pirated feel to the quality, or lack of. You insert the disc and it just starts automatically into the episodes, no menu or anything. Feels like I should have paid some guy $5.00 from he's car trunk for it.",1193529600,16,285,4.296296296296297
2911826,2,B000TYWW80,"This set includes 3 disks with 2 shows per disk, total of 6 episodes.  The episodes are:

42.  Carroll Shelby Bike 1  original air date: 1/31/2005
43.  Carroll Shelby Bike 2  original air date: 2/7/2005
44.  Lincoln Mark LT Bike 1  original air date: 2/14/2005
45.  Lincoln Mark LT Bike 2  original air date: 2/21/2005
47.  Junior's Dream Bike 1  original air date: 3/7/2005
48.  Junior's Dream Bike 2  original air date: 3/14/2005

I believe these sets are privately produced by Amazon, definitely not by the Learning Channel's production company.  This is a bare bones set.  NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk.  Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at $5+ per episode, the price is steep.  Come on Learning/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!",1192060800,18,843,4.769230769230769

8211469,1,B000TYWW80,"Don't waste your time buying on Amazon, buy off I tunes and then you can transfer the actual file to any device that you want instead of being forced to view on Amazon Video, I Tunes is also cheaper priced.",1463702400,,206,4.175

8211476,4,B000TYWW80,"They are a hoot to watch and see how they work out stressful situations, and kill the time with jouste wars and paintball games.
I can relate to pulling pranks on team mates, and gives me more good ammo to deal with around my work place.
Very fully group of guys.",1387756800,,263,4.176470588235294
