7849254,5,6303515924,"What a fantastic set released by Cabin Fever! Remastered and Unedited, hosted by Film Historian Leonard Maltin. This set is the second in the series, the first being Volumes 1 - 12. These are VHS standard play and if you have a VHS/DVD player, you can watch them. I don't even think these are available on DVD but if they are, they are rare indeed since the company is no longer in business. Each volume is introduced by Leonard Maltin and he talks about the episodes briefly. This set consists of 36 EPISODES, 4 on each VHS. I am going to try and dupe these over to blank DVDs for preservation on my Magnavox VHS/DVD recorder. I believe these are also in chronological order which is an added plus. Well worth the few bucks I spent on this set!",1425686400,2,745,4.366906474820144
