2832024,4,B000Q6GUVQ,I LOVE THE AVATAR SERIES FOR THE MOST PART.  THE SECOND SEASON IS MY LEAST FAVORITE (NOT REALLY SURE AS TO WHY THOUGH).  THIS SEASON HAS SOME GREAT EPISODES IN IT AND IS A MUST HAVE IF YOU'VE WATCHED ANY OF THE AVATAR AND ENJOY IT.  I ALSO RECCOMEND THE OTHER TWO SEASONS THE THIRD IS MY FAVORITE MOSTLY DUE TO HOW EVERYTHING TIES TOGETHER AND THE INTERESTING TWISTS THAT WE MAY HAVE SEEN COMING BUT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW THEY WOULD GET THERE.  SO ENJOY THE SERIES AND ALL THE SUSPENSE AND ACTION OF THEM.,1240272000,,502,4.144329896907217
2832025,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"Some of the kids in my daughters school started showing up with blue arrows on their foreheads, so I asked what it meant, being the dumb grownup that I am.  Avatar, was the answer, and one of the other children brought a copy the next day for ""everyone"" (me, my wife and our daughter) to watch.  Now I have never shrunk from watching endless repeats of Finding Nemo, or Cars, but I was not prepared for the Avatar phenomenon.  It drew me right in and has held my attention though each episode, and I sometimes think I like it more than my own daughter likes it.  There is nothing not to like about this series and it is truly for every age group, which is pretty amazing.

One of the other parents I know passed on Avatar, without watching any, claiming it was too violent, too much war, blah, blah.  In fact, it is about a world at war, and a very long war.  And there is some violence, although I do not believe a single character has been killed, nor has anyone shed blood.  There have not been any moments when my daughter felt too frightened to watch.  And it is really not about war but about being redeemed from war.  The Avatar, a young boy, is trying to stop the war and save the world.  But it is not namby pamby about showing some pretty  hard fought battles and the creators have clearly done some intensive studying on the different martial arts styles.  Anyway, the stories are all great and you should become addicted too, just like me.",1206835200,7,1451,4.32962962962963
2832026,5,B000Q6GUVQ,I've become addicted to this crazy little series. It's a little corny is some aspects but it's also rather entertaining. I also let my neice and nephew watch this series as it's good clean animation that I don't have to worry about them picking up bad habbits for language from.,1193270400,,278,4.58
2832027,5,B000Q6GUVQ,It's the Avatar. My whole family enjoys watching it together or seperate. We eagerly await the new episodes on TV.  There really isn't anything not to like. If you like the show. You will like the DVD. Kudos to Amazon for offering the same or similar pricing as Wal-Mart. I am only sorry to see the show come to an end...,1191369600,,321,4.262295081967213
2832028,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"I am amazed at how when I walk by as my children are watching this cartoon, I get sucked in.  It's fun, exciting, and wholesome.",1191283200,,128,4.12
2832029,5,B000Q6GUVQ,The only problem with this DVD is that you have to wait for the next season..,1191283200,,77,3.875
2832030,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"I have to admit, in this day and age, very few animations that are ""made-for-American-audiences"" have caught my attention like AVATAR, THE LAST AIRBENDER.  I came across the pilot episode by accident, flipping channels and ending up on Nickelodeon. I am an anime fan and an artist/writer myself, so I was obviously interested.  And I gotta tell ya, for an animation that is intended for children, it is much more intelligent then I thought it would be.  And seeing as how one of the creators is a student of the martial arts, (the influence being obvious to me), the creators seem to be writing what they know and have executed their story successfully (with a flare of the fantastic I might add).  This particular volume (Vol. 4) has shown a variety of character reversals that I found to be accurate after viewing the previous Books and their volumes.  In my opinion, if a parent wants to slowly introduce their child to some of the philosophies behind martial arts, and the models, philosophy and lore that underpin many philosophical systems and the spiritual energy practices, religious observance and personal discipline associated with the CHAKRAS (Sanskrit term meaning wheel), this volume is a great way to start. I just hope the creators and their associate writers continue to remain intelligent with their writing in the next few animated books, Fire and Air.  If so, their successful executions I believe will follow...  (Many props to the Korean/Japanese animators). Looking forward to seeing the rest on DVD.  (NOTE: These animated books are best viewed without commercial interruptions.)",1190592000,,1603,5.068441064638783

8194519,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"My son and I really enjoyed this series, it was well written and animated. I like that it was as gross as many of the other Nicktoon, very family friendly, it does have its groaner moments though, and occasion spots where you go, could have done without that.",1454716800,,259,4.416666666666667
8194520,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"Love the Avatar series. Movie quality was great, I'd say a good 480P. Audio is a perfect match, no lip sync or lag. Shipping was fine.",1431820800,,134,4.1923076923076925

8194525,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"This is such a great series.  One of my Aikido kid students recommended it to me and I got hooked early.
Strong characters, both male and female; great villains; awesome fight sequences; good communication modeling (even for adults); and an epic finish.",1289779200,,253,5.023809523809524
8194526,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"This is One of the Best Anime Ever release. My daugher, who is a senior, was very upset when I gave away this set to my neices and nephews. She is now demanding that I buy her a new set. You cannot go wrong with this product. It is good for the young and old alike.",1287619200,,265,3.75
8194527,5,B000Q6GUVQ,"My whole family enjoyed watching this series on TV. So when I saw that I could buy the whole set, I did. There are life lessons in every episode. I would rate this a PG for parental guidance. Somethings will have to be explained for children that are even older than 7. I would not recommend this for children younger than 7 years old though.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-The-Complete-Book-2-Collection/dp/B000QUEQ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 2 Collection</a>",1264291200,,572,6.441558441558442
