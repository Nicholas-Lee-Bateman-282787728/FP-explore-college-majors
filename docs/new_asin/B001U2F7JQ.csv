8342630,5,B001U2F7JQ,"Chuck Smith and other pastors from Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa debrief us with the latest on how Biblical prophecies from 1,000s of years ago are being fulfilled today.  They are using scriptures and recent news stories to update us on the state of the world in comparison to the state of the world described in the scriptures leading up to our Lord's return.  Every new years eve Chuck gives these updates to encourage believers to turn to the Lord and to show how God's Word never fails, and that it is relevant to today.",1238025600,4,521,4.531914893617022
