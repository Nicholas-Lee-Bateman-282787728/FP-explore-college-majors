5463108,5,B00AOCDDO4,"Great family movie that we will enjoy over and over. Loved the message and of course, loved the dog, Duke!",1365724800,,106,4.35
5463109,5,B00AOCDDO4,"As soon as my daughter brought this movie to my attention I had to see it! It has two of my special interests, the first (of course) being dogs and how they relate to their two legged friends, the second the mental and physical aspect of any returning soldier.

PTSD (or Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder) is (finally) recognized around the globe yet has existed for as long as warriors have been in active duty. It can be summarized also that it is not only soldiers but anyone who has undergone dramatic experiences as well as their immediate families which often suffers the consequences.

I have seen first hand PTSD resulting of four years of trench fare (grandfather), WW 2 labour camp (father) and soldiers who have come and gone (ret. AFES caseworker for ARC).  I hope you will join me later this week as I return to this subject with another review!

Terry Pulaski's story related in the movie 'DUKE' will introduce anyone to the struggles even the most dedicated and well trained soldier feels when faced with such challenge as PTSD and disability. Some do recover, some struggle their whole life and some lose the battle.
Four years in the trenches left my grandfather with only one lung (mustard gas) and the fear of any whistling sound. An honour soldier standing at 6' 3', no one guessed his fears but his closest loved ones as he flinched  at the mere sound of the wind!

Back to Terry and Duke though! This is the warmhearted story of one veteran struggling to deal with flashbacks and his fears at no longer fitting amongst family and society. He finally leaves his wife and daughter, living for a decade on the edge of society with an amazing dog as his only companion. 'DUKE' is a breathtaking recount of one's man struggles and his four legged friend. As for Duke himself, this beautiful collie will pull at your heartstrings with his show of unconditional love!

Based on a true story, this movie shows Terry coming back from Iraq, wounded both in the leg and in spirit. He loses everything but Duke's steadfast love (as only four legged friends gives), until one day tragedy strikes and they are separated.

I would not spoil this story for you so I will refrain to say anymore. This is a movie with a heartfelt message, one based on love and hope, but also duty and honour and a reminder that a soldier's duty is to never leave any man behind!

Steven Weber as Terry Pulaski and Mark Jean as director are to be applauded for a fantastic rendering of DUKE, a dog like no other!!

5 Stars and people, grab a copy and enjoy with the whole family!

Remember that unless stated otherwise, reviews are only a reflection of my opinion!",1363046400,15,2650,4.5813953488372094

It's a kleenex box needed movie, but it touches your heart and you don't even have to love dogs to enjoy it, but is will sure appeal to dog lovers, border collie fans, and just plain soft hearted romantics of the world. Gives a good insight into what some of the returning vets,and their families are facing too. Recommend it for a Hallmark flic as not being to sappy either.",1357084800,14,485,4.170212765957447

5463164,5,B00AOCDDO4,"Ah, Weber from Wings. He is so fantastic in this role. The movie is great, moving, emotional, sad and yet wonderful! You have mixed feelings as to why he does what he does in the beginning, but as it goes, you will understand and actually related to it. The dog is so loving, he will steal your heart. I watched it first, then again that night with hubby. I finally asked him, ""Honey, why are your sinuses so messed up,"" (knowing why, but had to tease him) he just grabbed another tissue and replied, ""What do you mean?""
Yes, you will shed some tears, heart tugs and then elation! He is a Vet with PTSD, but dog to the rescue and then the whole Community gets involved. I so recommend this movie. My brother caught a piece ot two of it and asked if he could watch it. I said of course, but he said, ""If that dog dies I'll come after you."" He loved it too. Buy the movie.

Dare patrols the neighborhood as a detective and attempts to keep out various criminal elements. When a cop killer named ""Winkie"" arrives in the neighborhood, Dare become obsessed with finding a man who appears to be a ghost.

The film was engaging up the end which caused he to scratch my head. Seriously? That is how they wanted to end this film? Can I get an alternative ending?

The film is a crime drama with some violence. The acting was decent as was the tale up until the end.
