Well it's quite realistic as I mentioned in the title it really shows the reality of corrupt goverments not just in Guatemala but any countries who suffer similar political and social woes around the world. For me the timing is the best the movie is fluid it doens't cut short the aspect ratio good a 16x9 and of course it broke new ground by filming in a real prison with real prisoners, but the most that I like is that it is not like any other prison movie out there, it wasn't filmed just for entertainment but to see on how our societies are misjudging from one another and that suspicion and disrespect can lead into caos . Im sure this movie was new and great experience not just for actors but for guards, prisoners and authorities alike. I hope to see more filming production from casacomal in the future I recomend to watch this movie with an open mind.",1293062400,,998,4.370967741935484
