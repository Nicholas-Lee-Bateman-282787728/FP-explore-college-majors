8239322,5,B0010Y0XNE,"""Andre Rieu: Live in Tuscany"" was a gift for my sister and brother-in-law. The music is very beautiful and especially romantic. What a wonderful show performed live in the Plaza de Republica in Cortona, Italy. You cannot help but dream to walk in the Tuscan countryside with someone you love. Let your soul wander around in the historic town of Cortona. Andre Rieu with his orchestra, chorus and soloists were magnificent! It is a perfect gift for a special couple or someone extra special in your life ... someone who is passionate about life, love, music ... Italy ... a romance writer, artist, musician ... or just romantic at heart!",1517011200,,636,4.790909090909091
