8378186,5,B002R02F36,One of the greatest trilogies ever. If you love French films (and who doesn't?) and Juliette Binoche and Irene Jacob than you will love these films!!,1520899200,,149,4.769230769230769

8378188,5,B002R02F36,"Blue is among the best films I have ever seen. It has emotional power, a compelling story, surprising twists and elaborations, gorgeous imagery, living characters and numerous small stories that work together to bring an image of a woman and her life. I have now watched Blue perhaps 4 times and each time I see more--I love the way the theme color is woven back into the film.
The Red and White films are interesting and pleasant but are not of the same caliber for me.",1501027200,,470,4.476744186046512
8378189,5,B002R02F36,I've always loved the Three Colors trilogy. I bought the set on VHS back in the 1990s and of course it's almost impossible to buy a VCR now that they are no longer made. So I was thrilled to find a DVD set so reasonably priced.,1496707200,,227,3.9565217391304346
