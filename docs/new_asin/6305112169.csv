970237,4,6305112169,"Thoroughly enjoyable movie from start to finish. The western comedy genre is littered with well meaning but not very good entries with a few exceptions like Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles and quite possible James Garner's Support Your Local Sheriff and very few others nevertheless this western comedic gem is a great addition to this genre. Kudos to cast, writer (Talbot Rothwell), and crew. Definitely worth checking out.",1387584000,,419,5.268656716417911
970238,4,6305112169,"A highly amusing comedy and one of the very best entries to the Carry On series. The historical ones were generally regarded as the best in the  series and this one is exceptionally good ranking alongside Cleo (1964),  Don't lose your head(1966), Screaming (1966) and Up the kyber (1968) in  terms of quality. The players all take on surprisingly realistic American  accents and the whole scenery and costumes make this a little more  beleavable than ususal. The best players are Sid James as the rumpo kid in  one of his best roles in the series, Jim Dale, Joan Sims and Kenneth  Williams. This was probably the most darkest and violent of all carry On  films made but the shoot out scene at the end is wonderfully staged. A very  good comedy and a classic in the series.",967248000,11,772,4.576642335766423

Three women want to help him and each declares her interest with the prefix ""we go  together like...""  [visualize the women for yourself] --  [a] ham  and eggs  [b] peaches and cream  [c] syrup and pancakes. It was years  ago that I watched this movie and I still smile recalling the hi jinx and  farce.",917568000,4,435,4.271604938271605

970403,3,6305112169,"Not bad, for a western comedy. In this film a bad man called the Rumpo Kid takes over Stodge City. He is challenged by a lawman named Marshal, who is a plumber instead of a marshal. The movie is notable for an incredibly unconvincing Indian chief called Big Heap.",1431216000,,263,4.387755102040816

7883486,5,6305112169,"As other reviewers have said, this is one of those ""types"" of movies that you either love or pretty much can't stand. Yes, it is extremely corny. Yes, it is full of double entendre. Yes, it feels dated. So, if that isn't something you enjoy...this is not going to make for one of those great movie-viewing sessions.

With that said, a quick look at Wikipedia reminds us that the ""Carry On"" collection includes 31 low-budget British comedy motion pictures  four Christmas specials, a television series of thirteen episodes, and three West End and provincial stage plays. So, there is something here that many people have found extremely entertaining.

One of the most fun parts of Carry On Cowboy, and other early pieces in the series, is finding those actors who keep popping up in more current movies and television. For example...it was fun to watch the 'younger' Joan Sims here, and then watch her in a more mature role as the crazy spouse of 'Rocky' in the BBS show ""As Time Goes By"". There are a lot of us who watch these things with our iPads on our laps, ready to hunt down those familiar faces...it's all part of the fun.

It's movies like this one that makes my Amazon Prime subscription worth keeping around.",1455580800,,1218,4.651162790697675
7883487,1,6305112169,"There were too many ""double entendre"" phrases to give this movie a possible passing grade.  My brain grew tired watching the overkill of a promising movie plot!  The screenwriters sentenced this production to death with the constant play on words.",1455235200,,247,5.15
7883488,4,6305112169,This was a pretty good film overall. The plot was slightly similar to Blazing Saddles (without the racial elements) and the actors were surprisingly strong. I'm glad I decided to give this film a look.,1453852800,,201,4.771428571428571
