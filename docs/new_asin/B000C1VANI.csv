The crew of the residential wing find themselves back at Earth, but are separated from it by a temporal barrier. When the pilots cross this barrier, the realize that Earth is actually in a different time continuum. The crew of the Watcher's Nest must collapse this barrier to stop the invasion, even if it costs them their ticket home, and their relationship with Misaki.

This DVD is the 2nd season of Divergence Eve. It is better than the 1st season, but still a little better than average. I like the way season 2 starts off. We get a better understanding of Misaki's feelings and we see some flashbacks about her past.  This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized., especially in season 1. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you. If you can rent it before buying it, I recommend doing that before you buy it.",1353801600,,1712,4.5732899022801305
8095130,4,B000C1VANI,"In 2003, DIVERGENCE EVE  aired on Japanese TV, earlier this year, ADV Films released the first season on DVD.

  Coming out in January 2005, is the second season of the series titled DIVERGENCE EVE: MISAKI CHRONICLES.  A twelve episode series that aired in 2004.
  In season one, the main storyline took place in the 24th Century where intergalactic space travel has become a reality.

  One of the major outposts in the space is the ""WATCHER'S NEST"", an inflation hole drive portal that is being under attacked by these mysterious force known as GHOUL.

  A group of young female cadets who have just finalized their training as elite pilots of the Seraphim Squadron are about to meet their match against the GHOUL.

  The main focus among the female cadets is Misaki, your typical cute and clumsy girl who happens to go through some unusual, mysterious transformation when she comes in contact with a GHOUL.

  In ""MISAKI CHRONICLES"", the first episode focuses on Young Misaki as she remembers her father (a famous pilot) and training hard in school to follow her father's footsteps.

  She teams up with her cadet friends as they undergo training and all fine and dandy right?

  Unfortunately not.  Because the last we saw these women at the end of DIVERGENCE EVE, they were either dead, discharged or MIA.

  Reality is either not reality and something is definitely wrong.
  Thus the storyline shifts to Lieutenant Commander Ertiana and the survivors of WATCHER'S NEST who are trying to find out about the mystery of why the Earth is normal and the Universe is in chaos.

  The storyline takes you to space and into history as the GHOUL has found a way to go back in time (episode 2 and 3 takes Ertiana to feudal Japan) and possibly change the future for Earth.

  One thing that will definitely remind you that you are watching a DIVERGENCE EVE anime is that all the women are well-endowed.  As mentioned in my last review for the series, this anime screams out ""BOOB-FEST!""

  This second series is no different as Misaki's assets are shown quite a bit and anime fans of fan service will not be disappointed.

  As for the anime, MISAKI CHRONICLES is definitely a beautiful anime to look at.  The female characters are strong, sexy and independent and interesting.

  As for the storyline, I actually found the anime series much more enjoyable than DIVERGENCE EVE.

  The preview DVD I watched had three episodes and all I can comment right now is that the three episodes were enjoyable, but I emphasize that it helps to watch the first season of DIVERGENCE EVE before watching MISAKI CHRONICLES for better understanding of the characters, GHOUL and the twist in the universe.

  So, far this anime features some intriguing twists and I'm enjoying it thus far.",1220400000,,2768,4.788912579957356
8095131,5,B000C1VANI,"Misaki Chronicles vol 1. is a fitting follow-on to the Divergence Eve series. Like the first series, the first few episodes start constructing a deep mystery, leaving the viewer to try to guess what's going on.

The first episode seems to be set just before the events of Divergence Eve, but we later find out that the timeline jumps around. The story in fact follows Divergence Eve, but provides prequel episodes of Misaki at the academy. Only we find out later that the events don't exactly follow what was 'supposed' to happen.

The series then begins to jump around in time, featuring several historical events from Japan's history (1594, 1936, etc). Unfortunately, the events do not have as much significance to Western viewers, and an Extras page with historical info and the significance of the event would have probably been a good idea.

The extras aren't quite up to the standards set in Divergence Eve. I particularly liked the tech specs on the inside cover from the original trilogy, but that is sadly lacking. Instead we're treated to an image of the girls in skimpy swimwear.

Of course, the first thing one notices when watching this disc is the girls ... and their attributes. Most of the female characters are well-endowed, and some (such as Misaki) are quite bouncy. The fan service is probably actually a little subdued from the first series, but that's not saying much.

Like the first series, you may start watching this for the fan service, but the engaging story will draw you in. Once the story starts moving, the fan service actually subsides in favor of the deep plot. It isn't often that I watch an entire 5-episode disc from start to finish in one evening. This one (as well as the first series, which I also highly recommend) is one of the few exceptions.",1144886400,3,1785,4.745161290322581
