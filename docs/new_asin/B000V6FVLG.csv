2930811,5,B000V6FVLG,"I'm 62 years old and I've gone to lots of yoga classes with mostly young people and I can't turn my body into pretzels anymore. I found this video in a class for seniors and I love it. It allows me to get the most out of yoga without feeling guilty about not being able to twist my body into positions that I can no longer do. It's fun, relaxing and great for stretching and balance.",1270684800,13,383,4.052631578947368
2930812,5,B000V6FVLG,"Excellent videos for beginning and older yoga students ~  Peggy has a very calming voice and is very easy to follow.  If you are just learning about yoga, it is a great set to have!",1258329600,5,181,4.142857142857143
2930813,5,B000V6FVLG,"There are three different DVD's in this set. I have only done the one for backs so far. It is amazingly relaxing. I have tried yoga videos before and have found them to be too difficult for me. I am in my sixties, not very flexible, with knee and back pain. I was able to do all of the exercises in the DVD for backs except one. I was finally able to do it with a yoga strap. I felt immediately better after the exercises and continued to feel better the next day. Some of the exercises are the very poses I had to do in my physical therapy sessions for my arthritic knees.

I think Type A personalities would find Peggy agonizingly slow and soft-spoken. I can see my Type A daughter falling asleep right away. But it is the very slowness and low-key aspects of her approach that relax me. I found that I did not even need to watch the video. Her verbal instructions were very thorough and understandable. She even tells you when to breathe in and out. I expect that the deep breathing alone helped me relax and, thus, decreased my pain.

I appreciated it that she did not get into the spiritual parts of yoga. I am only interested in how it can help me physically. I did the whole video one exercise after the other. But many people may not have time for that because it takes over an hour. The good thing about the DVD is that it is divided into seven different sections so that one can pick and choose the sections to do depending on need and time.

I would recommend this to any one who is able to tolerate a very slow and deliberate pace. If you know you are the personality type who can not tolerate slowness, then this is probably not the DVD set for you.",1255046400,82,1662,4.2037617554858935
2930814,2,B000V6FVLG,"Peggy may be good but on these videos, she talks way too much and then is like her students are doing it for the first time so she stops to correct them. Also I do not used them anymore because my lower back begun to hurt again, unfortunately maybe my back is too sensitive so I am stuck with the three dvd's and I don't even used them. I guess there is no such of thing as gentle yoga for the ones who suffer of back problems.",1252627200,6,427,3.9195402298850577
2930815,5,B000V6FVLG,"I am in my 20's and overweight due to a health condition. I always wanted to try yoga, but was always intimidated because of my size and inflexibility. Not anymore. The modified poses make it easy for people of any age, fitness level or flexibility to do yoga (I got the set from my 77 year old grandma who used them). I come away from each routine feeling stretched, relaxed and renewed. In just a few short weeks I have already increased my flexibility. Plus, the relaxation at the end of each session is an added bonus. I highly recommend this series to anyone who has ever wanted to try yoga. It is easy to follow and really is for everyone. To heighten the experience I recommend doing it by yourself and playing relaxing music, makes it a much more enjoyable.",1240012800,35,765,4.432624113475177

My Physical Therapist told me to keep using the techniques!!  Peggy Cappy makes it so enjoyable and ""YES..ANY BODY CAN DO THIS!!"" I have been using it every morning since I got it and LOVE IT!! I tried a Pilates DVD for Beginners, and only made myself limp more.  This set contains 3 DVD's:  Yoga for the Rest of Us, More Yoga for the Rest of Us and Yoga for Back Care.

2930829,4,B000V6FVLG,"Warm up exercises are very easy to do. Expect anyone could do these because they are done in a chair. Standing exercises are much more difficult and require you to pay very close attention to instructions in order to do these right. Very easy to not do right. Sun salutation is extremely difficult to understand for a beginner plus some of the moves are very difficult. I found that I needed to buy another DVD on ""Heart Healthy Yoga"" by Peggy Cappy to get a good understanding of how to do these moves plus much more preparation before attempting moves. So I think this DVD is OK but if you are like me you will need better instructions for standing exercises and for sun salutation. I bought several DVDs and also bought Peggy Cappy's book in order to better understand moves. What I did was check out the book plus lots of Peggy Cappy DVDs from the library and then select the items I wanted before making purchases. The right combination was not obvious from the titles or descriptions.",1412208000,3,990,4.5363128491620115

Peggy's tape are wonderful, she always shows different ways of doing each exercise by way of having a room of people doing the same thing but different.  She spends time explaining each step and always letting you know if you can not lay on your back you are getting the same benefit by doing this in a chair, if you can not stand on one foot you will reap the same benefit by doing.....
All exercises have a variety of ways to do them and she is not a show off and is usually doing the simple way, letting others do the medium and more difficult ways.",1403827200,3,697,4.072992700729927
2930834,5,B000V6FVLG,I love Peggy Cappy! I do her yoga every day. It really is for everyone. I am in my sixties and I really feel great after doing her yoga.

2930835,3,B000V6FVLG,"I thought the program also included specific poses for arthritis suffers, but did not find that.

2930837,5,B000V6FVLG,This group of exercises is easily accessible to those of us who are older or who have chronic muscle &/or joint issues.  It does move slowly and I can imagine that if you are younger or have no other issues this might be too slow for you even at a beginning level.,1394496000,,264,4.076923076923077
2930838,2,B000V6FVLG,"I was really studying all the Peggy Cappy titles, because I like her calm teaching, but this series of discs was not the right choice unfortunately.  It's too slow, not intense enough for me.  Perhaps as I age it will fit a need, but it's not right now.",1393200000,,253,4.25
2930839,5,B000V6FVLG,Peggy Cappy's Yoga for the Rest of Us DVD series is a true beginners workout.

I noticed that Peggy's soft voice and precise instructions (no music in these videos) help me relax - workout sessions seem to fly by. - Never been much for yoga and am surprised that Overall we feel stronger and more agile-  Good activity for cold winters.,1389225600,3,375,4.434782608695652

I am going to get this DVD for my mother who is 83.  I think she will be able to do most of it.

I can see that it will help with strength and balance.",1388534400,2,414,3.8

2930847,5,B000V6FVLG,"These yoga videos are perfect for me (woman in 60's)!  I have tried other videos, but Peggy Cappy's timing for breathing is perfect.  Her voice is calming.  Whenever my back pain acts up, I do some yoga exercises and the pain disappears.",1365120000,2,237,4.595238095238095
2930848,5,B000V6FVLG,"I started yoga after a back procedure in December 2011 at the recommendation of the doctor. I was skeptical.  I started at the gym and enjoyed it so much that I purchased this dvd as a recommendation from the instructor.  It is gentle/therapeutic yoga and you can do it as your body lets you.  What I like is that it is a 3 dvd set, two dvds are 50 min sessions of different yoga exercises. The third is back basics which is 2 hours but you can just choose a section to do.  Yoga has helped me alot. When I started my flexibility was very limited. If I tried to touch the floor my fingers were at least a foot from it and now I can touch the floor and that is only in 2 months of yoga.  I am a firm believer in yoga now! I love this dvd set and have recommended it to several of my friends.",1330819200,6,790,3.9125
2930849,4,B000V6FVLG,"Most of the Yoga videos are too long.  I don't have the time or interest to spend 60 or 90 minutes in front of the TV.  For someone who is super fit, this would not be a good choice.  For an older person, someone who either has a handicap or is not in good shape, this would be a fine choice.  The only complaint I have is that it does not go into enough detail for the different poses.  Maybe it's not necessary.  In my salad days I was exposed to Yoga that was more precise, but this is no longer necssary for my purposes.  I want to remain flexible and improve my balance without being macho.  This works.",1330214400,4,608,4.050420168067227
2930850,5,B000V6FVLG,"So far I have only used the Back Care Basics DVD but it is THE BEST I've ever done for back stretches and exercises. Can't recommend it enough! I bought the 3-pack because it was such a good value. I had already viewed the Back Care Basics from my local library and new I wanted it. I know the other 2 DVD's will be great. I don't know how yoga people would view the video, but for back care I think it is fantastic.",1324166400,3,416,3.9642857142857144
2930851,3,B000V6FVLG,"It's pretty good. I like that I can choose a short segment. Having taken from a fantastic teacher in the past, I am a little frustrated by the lack of directions as to form for each pose. She gives only very basic cues. There is a good mix of poses on each of the 3 videos. A nice workout. Like that she gives the option of using a chair (similar to the Yoga for Osteoporosis book).",1309910400,8,382,4.0394736842105265
2930852,5,B000V6FVLG,"wonderful dvd-being a senior citizen, I needed something suitable for me, not someone young and fexible-the instructor had a wonderful soft voice and used simple to follow instructions-just what my body needed, actually what everyone needs-this dvd is for anyone who needs to improve their body at a slow and easy pace-----the seller shipped this out quickly and the dvd was in perfect condition.",1297468800,4,396,5.203125

I've had trouble with my back for several  years, and since I've been following this video the pain has been greatly reduced.  The relaxation part at the end is not to be missed!",1286755200,,336,4.442622950819672

2930856,5,B000V6FVLG,"These dvds, all three are designed for those of us who are not agile, physically fit, or young.  I purchased this set mainly to get the back care basics dvd... the other two dvds are also good. Peggy Cappy has a calm, soothing voice and narrates and demonstrates the programs along with a some of her students.  These students represent a wide range of ages and abilities. If a 90+ year-old person can do this, then why can't I?

The back care basics is wonderful for strengthening and helping those with back problems. This dvd was the reason I bought the set. I am a very overweight grandmother with arthritis and have had back problems for most of my life. (And I have never been or hope to be an athletic person.) I am able to easily follow the step-by-step moves and am realizing increased strength and flexibility.

The other two dvds are basic yoga routines done with support (and security) of a chair to help develop the balance and flexibility for healthy living.  These are my goal for the future.  I plan on being able to do all of the three videos with ease.",1284249600,4,1070,4.461538461538462
2930857,5,B000V6FVLG,"I wanted to resume yoga after many years of not practicing. But I soon found out that even 'beginners' dvds were too strenuous for me; I have several issues of stiff places, sore places, old injuries to even BEGIN to do what is described as 'beginners poses'..so I began searching for 'senior yoga' and found Peggy Cappy's dvds and her book. I had had one of her dvds, years ago, but gave it away when I quit yoga..I ordered this set of 3 and her book and her 'heart healthy' dvd. Her book encourages me to do what I can, and most important, I can do her modified poses and feel the benefits. I have a long way to go, to be more flexible; but I recommend these and the book to anyone who wants to resume yoga practice, but are afraid to try..she is very gentle, encouraging and patient as a teacher. The people in her dvds are ordinary people (like me) and that is encouraging as well.",1277510400,28,885,4.242603550295858
2930858,4,B000V6FVLG,"I ordered this product because I have disabilitiy in one of my legs, and overall muscular weakness.  I have difficulty doing most any type of yoga or exercise.  I have been able to perform most of the exercises and stretches in these DVD's.  In each DVD, several options are given for performing the poses, depending on your abilities.  The program moves at a slow pace.  After the first or 2nd run through, you may find yourself wishing it moved a little faster.

Overall, I think these dvd's are good for people like me with limited mobility and/or disability.  My favorite is Back Care Basics, followed by the original Yoga for the Rest of Us.  I don't use the 3rd, More Yoga for the Rest of Us very often.",1273190400,19,709,4.484375

I started this series when I was recovering from a very bad foot injury and had very limited mobility (ie: couldn't walk). This was probably the only form of exercise I could handle because the entire series is done on the floor. The exercises Peggy shows you in this DVD are incredible - they are so simple and relaxing but feel SO GOOD. I love how this DVD has different sections in it too, so if you don't have time to do the entire DVD you can pick and choose. I would do two sections a day and then it felt like something new all week. I don't use the DVD as much anymore because I pretty much have the routines memorized and do a lot of the moves on my own now, but I am forever grateful for Peggy for creating this video because it has helped me so much.",1511049600,,879,4.0285714285714285
