The flashes of boobs are so few and far between that they might as well have been omitted (not to mention the context, one scene is actually discussing NOT having women stripping at car events because the lady racers think it doesn't add anything to the culture).  I saw exactly two brief flashes of babes in bikinis taking their tops down.  At least it wasn't censored like many Street Fury dvd's are when produced by TokyoPop, but there was basically nothing worth censoring anyway.  The featured model doesn't show any skin whatsoever, she just promotes her web site basically. It kind of annoys me that the girl on the cover is so scantily clad and prominent when that's not at all what this dvd is even about.

Car stuff is ok if you are into amateur drag racing and illegal street racing.  And yeah, some silly segments with the two jokers running around.  If you're into that.",1422662400,,977,4.61271676300578
7949829,1,B00005Q4E0,"I think this video was perhaps the cheesiest and corniest car video I have ever seen. horrible interviews and corny characters were not the only problem. not enough race coverage and not so hot cars. The music was descent and some of the girls were hot. but don't be fooled. you won't last to the end of the DVD. bottom line, its a waste of money. I recomend the G-force tape or the ""ultimate street machine"" .",1017532800,3,410,4.337662337662338
7949830,4,B00005Q4E0,"The first installment of Tokyo Pop's Street Fury video magazine captures the import-lover's attention immediately.  The car shots are many and beautiful, and there are plenty of drag racing shots, as well.  The hostess is beautiful, and doesn't sound like an idiot.  It has a decent soundtrack, when there is music.  Plenty of interviews with famous drag racers.
There are two things which keep this from being a five:  first, and not too egregious is the sense of discontinuity throughout the magazine.  One video segment doesn't necessarily lead into the next very smoothly.  The more obvious fault of this video is the two characters thrown in for 'comic relief'.  They drive around in a rustbucket and assault street racers, asking them questions about their cars, which proves to be merely annoying rather than funny.
Street Fury Gold kicks off the series with a winner.  If you're an import fan, pick this one up.",1007424000,6,919,4.954248366013072
