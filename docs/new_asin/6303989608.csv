7858668,5,6303989608,"Ok, so I know most of these reviews were made over 10 years ago, but since Renee is my mom, I had to comment back. This video was made purposefully to give people a ""BASIC"" knowledge of sign language. She has been a ASL interpreter for over 25 years and is highly respected in the deaf community. She's one of the most requested interpreters in the area, actually. She has interpreted for pro sports teams, a US President, theater productions, and many other celebrities. This video is not meant to teach the grammar and culture of the deaf. It's meant to be a tool to help regular people interested in knowing basic signs. Not as a substitute for higher learning. This was just a fun project for her. Sorry if it disappointed some, but like the title says, it's BASIC Sign Language. As in, here's the sign for ""Restroom"". If you want more than that, go to a educational setting.",1301443200,,879,4.5
7858669,5,6303989608,I have seen the video quite a few times now to review what I have learned.  Renee is very pleasant and fun to watch.  She teaches the basic signs and the fingerspell alphabet with clarity.  I would highly recommend this video!,988848000,10,226,4.463414634146342
7858670,4,6303989608,I had taken a community school class and I learned more from Renee. It was a good start to learning basic sign language. She started with basic vocabulary. She was clear and slow which made it easy to understand. The  best thing about the video is that you can watch it over and over.,954720000,21,284,4.2592592592592595
7858671,5,6303989608,"I had taken Sign Language before, but I had lost some of the words. With it on tape it not only brought back the words but I can review it over and over again.  I can always review it again anytime I want to. In a classroom  you know the words in class but when you get home to pratice you forget.  This is something that you can do on your own time. I will even pratice  words in the car. If you want something for the kids or yourself to learn  Sign Language is a great language to learn. Both you and your kids could  learn this at the same time of having fun. Impress your friends!!!!",924652800,9,588,3.940677966101695
7858672,3,6303989608,"This tape is for a beginner who has no previous experience with the deaf community.  The etiquette of interacting with the deaf population is shown. For those unfamiliar with deaf interaction, this is extremely important.  She gives very basic information including such important factors as facial  expression, numbers and alphabet plus a limited vocabulary in ASL. This  tape can help a neophyte get started but is disappointing for people  already familiar with deaf culture and seeking to expand their vocabulary.",924134400,14,517,5.4125
