5911447,5,B00EF4U78M,The 3 Pack Loney Tunes SuperStars collection does have Full and WideScreen formats.  I gave the 3 pack an A+.  It's fun for the entire family.,1409788800,,142,4.423076923076923
5911448,2,B00EF4U78M,"Why can't Warner Bros (all studios) put out collections of the all-time favorites, as other reviewers stated, this is a fair collection but contains several odd episodes that weren't good in the 1960's and are less good 50 years later....",1391385600,3,238,4.975
5911449,3,B00EF4U78M,"There have been many Looney Tunes collections that have came out on DVD since 2002 with their first Looney Tunes; Golden Collection. While there have been a lot of ups, there have been many downs as well. Since 2010, Warner Brothers had decided to stop releasing Golden Collection editions, while strongly releasing 6 volumes that have been strong, they have not been able to follow it up very well. When they had started the Looney Tunes: Super Stars collections in 2010, there were hopes and promises with releasing promising collections. It had worked with releasing collections featuring shorts from Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck nicely, but sadly, they have had mostly mixed results with later releases from Foghorn Leghorn, and Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner in 2011. Now, 3 of the first four Looney Tunes: Super Stars collections are together in one compilation. But is it worth the money? Well, mostly no and yes somewhat.

Looney Tunes: Super Stars 3 pack consists of shorts featuring the definitive Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn and the thrill of the chase with the Coyote & Road Runner. The collections is all previously released DVDs from 2010 and 2011. Not really new shorts before. The collection works well with the Bugs Bunny shorts with many never released on DVD before with funnies like Bedeviled Rabbit with the goofy Tasmanian Devil, and the Million Hare where Bugs is competing against Daffy Duck for the chance to win The Million Box. The Foghorn Leghorn DVD  is alright, but not all of the shorts feature Foghorn, but still shows some funny shorts like Banty Raids where Foghorn takes in a crazed rooster who has a hankering for swooning lady hens and 60's surf music, and Weasel Stop where Foghorn teams up with a goofy weasel who wants chicken, but is outwitted a slow wood-widling dog. The Coyote & the Road Runner one though is the one that is completely fallen flat, where none of the classic shorts by the great Chuck Jones from he Termite Terrace era are featured at all, instead the lesser-recognized ones by the Rudy Larriva era are shown, and honestly are not as funny, as the thrill of the gags before. The ones Robert McKimson directed worked better a bit with Sugar And Spies and Rushing Roulette. But overall, doesn't strike with the formula that Chuck Jones made legendary.

Overall, you really don't get as much for your money with the Looney Tunes: Super Stars 3 pack. It would sit better for its bets if it included the ones that Warner Brothers had made with Pepe Le Pew: Zee Best Of Zee Best from 2012, where all of Pepe's shorts were shown, no shortcomings, and the Sylvester & Hippety Hopper disc: Marsupial Mayhem from earlier this year where it showcase not just Sylvester going after the giant kangaroo, but also trying to appeal to his son Sylvester Jr. nicely. This one doesn't work as well for just one as a must buy. If you are new to the Looney Tunes cartoons, I would definitely recommend the Looney Tunes: Platinum Collection or all of the Looney Tunes: Golden Collections for the money.

5911452,5,B00EF4U78M,Great Looney Tunes DVD. Good Ole Bugs as always with a little Foghorn and Wile E. Coyote as well.  Cant beat the price for these great old and new cartoons. There are 3 or 4 new age (2000 or newer) cartoons on the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner disc. I own the Looney Tunes Gold Collection Vol. 1 and this was a great edition to add. None of the cartoons on this DVD package are in the Gold Coll. Vol. 1.  I really enjoyed this Super Star 3 Pack and would recommend to other Looney Tune fans,1488412800,2,491,4.0

5911455,4,B00EF4U78M,"Three of the eight Looney Tunes Super Stars DVD volumes are in a 3-disc set, a 3-in-1 reissue of the original Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote volumes, for the price of a single volume, if not less! Sadly, 2/3rds of the Bugs Bunny DVD's shorts are still in Faux-Widescreen-only, hence being a reissue. The other 2 volumes offer Fullscreen AND Widescreen viewing options! What's more, this collection came in 2 different covers and boxes; one with blue and silver all over the cover and box, the other mostly white all over, but they're still 3-in-1 reissues of the individual DVDs; my sister has the white one, mine's the blue and silver one, and the contents are the same. Hers had a disc tray inside for the discs, but mine had its discs on top of each other; thank goodness for 6-disc DVD cases! At any rate, all 45 shorts on all 3 discs debuted from 1949 to 2010! Too bad none of the other volumes of the Super Stars collection got reissued in this manner! Individually or in sets like this, the Looney Tunes Super Stars DVD collection is a worthy accompaniment to the Golden and Platinum Collections, even with repeats, since Tweety and Sylvester's volume's full of repeats from the Golden Collection!",1485907200,5,1233,4.686635944700461

5911457,3,B00EF4U78M,"We enjoyed both the Foghorn Leghorn and the Bugs Bunny discs included with this set, although, as someone who is very familiar with the classic shorts, I must say the episodes here are definitely among the more obscure. I didn't get too many ""Oh I have always loved this one!"" moments while watching. But the set was bargain-priced, so I really wasn't surprised. Great for an evening of chuckles, though.

Unfortunately, the ""Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner"" disc is a joke. All episodes included were very modern, all made post-1970. As the daughter of a classic Roadrunner fanatic, I was SO disappointed by this, as was my husband. We pretty much skipped through and ultimately did not even watch this one.

Will have to invest in a more comprehensive set to share with the kids.",1483574400,2,783,4.75

8605041,4,B00EF4U78M,"This presents 3 DVDs of the Super Stars series. Bugs Bunny, Road Runner, & Foghorn Leghorn. Also with Foghorn are the gophers and the Mexican crows.

The road runner/coyote toons are from the 2000s, 90s, and mid 60s.

No special features other than trailers on the Road Runner DVD and widescreen/full screen options on that and the Foghorn DVD. The widescreen does not work on all Tv's.

There are 1000 or so WB cartoons. Most are shorts under 10 minutes. These should be released in one giant collection. Or one for each decade. They are starting to get it right with the Porky Pig collection which has every one of his cartoons from his debut until the 60s. We collectors want some order and completion rather than a few random cartoons put out.",1512777600,5,747,4.601503759398496
