3517207,1,B001CR49QG,"In the 1970s I was a talent agent in NY and it was part of my job to see as much theatre as possible. I was less interested in Bway and more interested in finding new talent. Announcements from every showcase (a no-salary, limited-run play that showcases actors, designers, playwrights, etc.) would arrive daily at the office. One was for a play that featured Jack Wrangler. Of course, I wanted to see this guy in-person.

From the moment he walked onstage, the evening turned excruciatingly painful for me. Apparently he was so deluded w/his own talent that he had no inkling that he was an embarrassment of major proportions. Let's start w/looks. A dwarf: very short w/a giant head. Not appealing. That voice: screechy and whiny simultaneously. How endearing. Acting talent: OMG. Dude could not say one line w/out it being so over-the-top, so horrifyingly wrong, so devoid of instinct, understanding or character analysis that it was like watching a parody of the worst acting you had ever seen.

I didn't stay to see if he got naked and left at intermission. As is often said about people who find their livelihoods in the sex industry: thank god for hookers and porn. Or else these no-talents would starve to death. In all my years of representing talent, this is right up there as one of the five most painful evenings of my career.

That his jerk managed to parlay his arrogance and stupidity into more than a one-line obit is a testimonial, I suppose, to how starved homos were for sexual entertainment in those days.

And, an BTW, the line that he was a ""director"" of just about anything is so bogus and self-serving that it merely offers addl proof of his conceit and self-deceit. (Do a search and see that this shrimpkin had no career other than porn -- and, in my view, he wasn't very good at that either.)",1247184000,3,1817,4.651090342679128
3517208,5,B001CR49QG,"""I never wanted to be an intellectual; I just wanted to be lusted after"". And so, Jack Wrangler's statement set the tone for this entertaining & fascinating documentary on his life & career, which was colorful & unusual, to say the least.
He became the poster boy for gay porn, sort of a ""Robert Redford"" for the genre, with his blond, masculine good looks. During the 70's, when the industry was finding its identity, Wrangler shot to the top.
What was even more stunning (which stunned everyone) was his 90-degree turnaround into forging a loving relationship with middle-aged singer Margaret Whiting in the 80's (whom he later married). Come what may, it just proves the point that love takes all forms, and nothing is really impossible...including love between a gay porn star & a songbird. It's obvious they really cared for each other.
Also amazing was how he re-invented himself after leaving porn. In an industry in which there is such a strong stigma attached once you perform in adult films, he found a new career as playwright, director & producer of many successful stage plays.
A truly remarkable man, every inch an actor (hence, here was an openly gay man who successfully managed to cross over into straight adult films!), Wrangler was one-of-a-kind. For anyone interested in the early days of the adult industry--and Wrangler himself--this is a must-see!",1242691200,2,1370,4.960869565217391

3517210,5,B001CR49QG,"Jack Wrangler passed away this week. I saw this film at last summer's Philadelphia gay film festival, and can recommend it to all who would like to know more about this sometimes contradictory, always interesting man. He was more than a ""sleazy porn star,"" having achieved success behind the scenes in theater and being highly respected by his co-workers. And his relationship with the love of his life, singer Margaret Whiting, is surprisingly sweet and surprising. The film could never explain all - but it gives a portrait of Jack pretty well. He will be missed.",1239148800,13,565,4.895833333333333
3517211,4,B001CR49QG,"In this age of ubiquitous internet pornography it may be difficult to grasp what a major impact Jack Wrangler had on the emerging gay community in the 1970s.  A failed actor and director, he originally drifted into pornography as male model--where his super-masculine image startled both gay and straight men who had been taught to think of homosexuals as limp-wristed and effeminate.  There was an immediate demand for him in gay film pornography and he was a tremendous success, making over eighty films, numerous personal appearances, and endless licensing deals.

Wrangler ultimately became a source of controversy for the gay community; although he himself was gay, he eventually moved into straight pornography, which had wider distribution and therefore bigger budgets and bigger salaries.  Many of his gay fans considered him something of a traitor for this--but this flap was nothing when compared to his love relationship with singer Margaret Whiting, a union that dropped jaws and set tongues to wagging in every gossip column from New York to Los Angeles.  Was he gay or straight?  Was he just a porno star on the make for a wealthy and well-regarded recording artist?  Just who the hell IS Jack Wrangler, any way?

WRANGLER: ANATOMY OF AN ICON answers most of the major questions.  Mixing narration, vintage film clips and interviews with friends and family, the bulk of the film is a prolonged interview with Wrangler himself, who does a credible job of describing his Beverly Hills upbringing as John Stillman, his career, and his relationship with the twenty-years-senior Whiting.  Are there unanswered questions?  Of course there are.  But on the whole, Wrangler comes off as intelligent and forthright, and now with hindsight acutely aware of his position as a gay man who made a host of unorthodox decisions for unorthodox reasons.  It is interesting stuff.

The DVD includes a handful of bonuses; the only significant one is a director's commentary by Jeffrey Schwartz.  Entertaining for those interested in the ""golden age"" of gay and straight pornography--and those who remember Jack Wrangler fondly.  Recommended.

3517212,5,B001CR49QG,"As a gay boy not of legal age when Jack Wrangler was in his ""hayday"" I became aware of him very early on, obsessing about this starkly beautifulu man and casting him in my youthful, sexual fantasies.  At 44, I now had the wonderful opprotunity to learn about the man behind the myth, cliche'd as that sounds.  ""Wrangler"" is a reasonably fair handed documentary look at one of gay porn's first stars, and dare I say it?  Superstars.  He was the first to cross-over into the heterosexual market, but far more remarkable was his ability to step beyond the boundaries of porn altogether, creating a life as a creative force on Broadway and ultimately marrying his soul mate...no less a woman, as much as surprise to him as to his devoted audience.  In the interviews within this film, we find that Jack is forthright, witty, charming, and still quite handsome at 60.  His willingness to be so candid about a life that many others would try to leave behind, makes him all the more likeable and strengthens his ""legendary"" status.  The extras on this disk offer much more detailed anecdotes from his days in gay porn, and throughout all of the film Jack's innate sense of humor propels the film forward where the director might otherwise fail to do so himself.  For film historians, gay men over 30, and anyone who might hold an interest in this subculture and vanished piece of American film history...""Wrangler"" works.",1233100800,9,1414,4.719512195121951
3517213,4,B001CR49QG,"When Jack Stillman took a new last name and bared it all before the camera, little did anyone know that this Beverly Hills child of privilege would become a name that would still resonate in the history of Gay Culture. In ""Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon,"" director Jeffrey Schwarz gets Wrangler to open up about his life, both as a show-biz brat and as a man who grew up and out of an industry legend.

Using a broad array of personalities, from Rod McKuen to Samantha Fox, Wranger's life and times are entertainingly illustrated. Wranger was both a product of his times and someone who helped to define them: the fact that he was so eager to sell himself as a legitimate entertainer AND as a product line was unheard of before Wrangler did it. There are plenty of images from Wrangler's life and movies, smartly juxtaposed with the timeline. As Wrangler grows older, the life he chooses to lead with pop-diva Margaret Whiting is given a fair explanation; a part of his life that seemed inexplicable to many gay men when it first unfolded.

Funny, interesting, bemusing and at times bittersweet, ""Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon"" is both interesting as a portrait of the man and of the times he lived in. Given that Gay and Straight Porn was once looked upon as a potential art form (before VHS and Downloads made it a dime a dozen industry), ""Icon"" is the real life counterpart to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>&nbsp;and a heck of a lot more historical.",1232841600,7,1566,5.089494163424124
3517214,4,B001CR49QG,"Wrangler has a legacy that will put him in the gay history books forever, which is what I think he really wanted.  Madonna may have learned a thing or two from his marketing startegy.  Regardless, he was a very likable, sex icon for the 70's early 80's the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time.  Really a product of the times, he had an impact that still ripples throughout the community.

This film is okay - but feels a little lightweight.  It is easy on the drama and tells us a lot of the obvious.  Interesting though is to hear him finally explain his marriage to Margaret Whiting and how that has worked all these years.  Some of the comments he makes in interviews in the ""extras"" section are more interstesing than those included in the film.

Overall, enjoyable and great to see a documentary about a very worthy subject.",1231372800,11,839,4.437908496732026

Also I  purchased some of his older films, which are available on DVD. so here's to Jack, thank you for sharing all your beauty and talent with all of us, and for me, showing me how there are so many men from various  backgrounds who enjoy each other, freely as they should.

3517217,5,B001CR49QG,"If you grew up in the 70's, you undoubtedly were exposed to at least one image of Jack Wrangler in the advertisements of your Dad's ""special magazines"". Wrangler started off as a gay porn icon and later delved in to the straight porn world, and could actually ""act"" (with tongue in cheek). The extended interview with Jack in the special features portion is hilarious and REALLY gives the viewer a taste of what gay porn culture was like in it's early days. There are tons of movie clips from both eras of his career, some with brief nudity. By the end of the film, I wanted to hang out with Jack and just go out to lunch or something. He really seems like a nice guy. Completely fun and entertaining and informative.",1315094400,,717,4.4393939393939394
3517218,3,B001CR49QG,"Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon is a documentary of ex-porn star Jack Wrangler. The interviews didn't really entertain me, but the old film footage sure did. I'm sure the movies that Jack Wrangler starred in were respectable back in the day, but today they look hilarious. Jack Wrangler's dialogue in those movies made me laugh out loud. What is disappointing is that for a documentary about a porn star, there are very few sex clips, and not as much nudity as you'd think. All in all, it's a documentary that's worth watching once for gay porn fans.",1309996800,,547,4.649484536082475
3517219,3,B001CR49QG,"The late Jack Wrangler was the lust object for thousands of emerging gay men during the late seventies and eighties. I loved his over-the-top exhibitionism, when closeted men were just beginning to dream of wearing sexy clothes and bathing suits which meant they should get in shape to flaunt it all--like Mr. Wrangler.

This is a good summary of what this gay icon was all about although my big complaint about these documentaries on sexual outlaws never show us the good, hot stuff that made them legendary. We're given montages of magazine and tabloid covers and very brief snippets from some of Wrangler's films, with just a brief glimpse of genitalia. But nothing is conveyed about the sizzling scenes that Jack created when he was in the throes of letting it all hang out on movie screens. The part of the documentary showing Warngler and his improbable wife, songstress Margaret Whiting is still surreal to watch.  A little disturbing to me was watching Wrangler in the deleted scenes contained in the ""Bonus"" part.  He often laughs maniacally about some incident he's describing and sometimes just babbles incoherently which makes one wonder if he was taking medication during these deleted observations.

In any case, this documentary is definitely worth a look at anyone interested in the wild and glorious days of sexual liberation when one could go to a big city and see a gay pornographic film without fear of being arrested and the film quite often showed Jack Wrangler in all of his naked glory.",1295568000,,1510,4.909803921568628

3517223,5,B001CR49QG,"Hmmmm, how do I write a review about a great documentary covering
one the of most explosive, controversial and pioneering icons of
1970's gay porn, and do it without my review getting rejected for
being inappropriate or lewd? (Cracks knuckles, clears throat!)

Okay, I'll give it a go!---Jack Wrangler was a galvanizing as well as
tantalizing figure to millions of gay men in a time when the gay community
was coming into it's own on the world stage and searching for icons to identify itself.
Here he was, this beautiful, virile, MASCULINE white man with washboard abs,
golden hair, the voice, the smile, and of course.. shall we say, THE GOODS!! (-:
He forever shattered the stereotype of the weak effeminate sissy who couldn't
defend himself, wore his mother's clothes, etc., which had been drilled into the
minds of mainstream society as well as many an isolated shame-filled gay man
who had been shunned, beaten up, and pushed far back into the closet!

Born into a very wealthy Beverly Hills family, he grew up alongside the spawn of
the old hollywood elite. But Jack Wrangler was a different kind of guy who could
move between the world's of the Hollywood elite and the low brow world of the
gay street life in L.A. during the 1960's. Trying to capitalize on his looks,
chiseled physique and Hollywood pedigree, he made a foray into the world of legit
movies in 1968. He did a few roles here and there, but nothing that made a big splash
or would've alerted the movie world that a new master thespian was on the horizon!
The thing that struck me about Jack in this docu-bio was his complete candor
and total lack of guile while telling his story!
He was really a decent guy who you could've approached and befreinded.
He made a move to NYC in 1969 to try to get into the broadway acting scene to gain
some credibility in his chosen craft, but very soon realized that he was a big fish
way out of his native pond in cold, dirty & competitive New York City!
He moved back to L.A., and some time during the early 70's, when porn chic had become all
the rage, and both the gay liberation and sexual revolution were in full tilt,
he emerged as JACK WRANGLER!!--America's first gay porn icon!
He made countless gay porn flicks, many of which have become classics,
had legions of male fans, did strip shows and lectures across the country,
and was celebrated all over!--And the ladies dug him too! (-:
They provide very good video clips and footage throughout this documentary.
I was noticing while seeing it, that some of the fictional ""Boogie Nights""
character ""Dirk Diggler"" was based partly on John Holmes and partly on Jack Wrangler.

Anywayz, ol' Jack was partying hard 70's style, making hit films and having
a gay old time, when he decided to do something that shocked and alienated
many of his devout gay fans....he decided to make the switch to straight porn!
(GASP!!--Oh no, he di-in't!!) Many of the female porn stars of the time lined
up to have their chance to work with Jack Wrangler, and to experience
his GIFTS first hand! (-: He made several well-recieved ""straight-for-pay""
films and gained many friends within the straight porn industry for his
professionalism and machine-like dependability!
As if his gay fans weren't already confused enough, he then ups the antie
and gets MARRIED!!--Yes, to a woman!---Yikes!
This was quite the dinner party conversation, and many scoffed & made cruel jokes.
But Margaret Whiting, a successful singer from the early 50's was convinced she
had found her man, and knew all about his ""shenanigans"" despite the pleas of her
then teenaged daughter and all of her freinds! (Clutch the pearls, honey!!)
Jack was ever honest and completely identified himself as a gay man (with bi tendencies).
He told her that he didn't think a marriage would work, but Margaret wasn't hearing it!
The two were married and went through alot of  ups and downs, but stayed together for
over 25 yrs until Jack's death earlier this year. The one thing that his marriage did
save him from was the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic in the early & mid 80's!
Both Jack & Margaret lost alot of dear freinds and collegues to the vicious virus!
They spent time in AIDS wards and hospices, trying to bring comfort and relief to
the many victims of the disease and also spent a great deal of money as well.
Through it all, Jack Wrangler never forgot who he was and remained a decent,
funny and very affable person who had led a very very interesting life! (-:
Rest In Peace Jack! (1946 - 2009)
This DVD was very enjoyable and I purchased it for my collection.
(Also see ""Gay Sex In The 70's""...it's another great documentary about
this amazing time in America and in gay/bi history!)",1248912000,7,4700,4.6727053140096615
3517224,5,B001CR49QG,"I have never seen a Jack Wrangler blue movie, ever. I was way too young when he was in his heyday, but I did come across one of his sex mags when I was a teenager. Nevertheless, I certainly knew who he was. In the gay community, he was legendary. He sort of broke the mold of the gay clone of the 70s, who all had mustaches and wore leather. Jack Wrangler was blond, clean-shaven, and golden.

WRANGLER: ANATOMY OF AN ICON DVD was one of Amazon's recommendations and so I decided to check it out. It was eye opening.

First off, Wrangler is really down to earth and didn't seem to take himself too seriously. He was born Jack Stillman in Beverly Hills, CA, and had an upbringing most of us would die for. He wasn't thrown out or disowned by his wealthy parents nor did the bad porn directors exploit him; he got into the adult entertainment business because he wanted to. He enjoyed it, liked showing his face, and branded his name--""Jack Wrangler""--to everything from poppers to sex toys, and he eventually crossed over to straight porn (funny that nowadays it's the straight adult male star who goes gay for more money). Wrangler, though gay, ends up falling in love with singer Margaret Whiting and they ended up getting married.

He would go on to become a mainstream director and producer for stage plays and musicals. This doc was done in 2008 and features interviews with Wrangler at that time [Wrangler passed away on April 07, 2009, from lung disease at the age of 62 (LA Times)]. He's funny, warm, and very different from what I expected.

The documentary tells Wrangler's story through photos, clips from interviews on talk shows, and some from his adult movies. There is some frontal nudity but there aren't any hardcore porn scenes, so don't worry.

Interviews with wife and singer Margaret Whiting, Wrangler's peers other adult actors/actresses and adult film makers, and gay personalities etc., are also peppered throughout the movie, as well as some great old footage of Hollywood in the 70s, including shots of old gay porn theaters in NYC and SF.

For special features there's almost 35-minutes of out-take interviews with Wrangler and audio commentary by director Jeffrey Schwarz, editor Jaime Meyers Schlenck, and composer Michael Cudahy.

The film was entertaining and interesting. In the film, Wrangler recalls his father's dying wish as wanting him to do something on a grand scale, now that he was on the straight and narrow.

I think for a generation of gay men, Jack Wrangler already did something big (no pun intended). He was comfortable being a gay man and made no apology for it. He wasn't embarrassed or ashamed of his sexuality--or the sex itself---being top and/or bottom in his movies, thereby allowing other gay men not to be ashamed of themselves either. Perhaps that's why he was so legendary. Of course, looking like everybody's all American didn't hurt either.

Anyway, if you enjoy documentaries and like gay themed movies, especially about gay history, get WRANGLER: ANATOMY OF AN ICON. I have some catching up to do on my classic gay porn viewing, LOL.;-)",1247270400,3,3097,4.795497185741088

8288913,5,B001CR49QG,"I have never heard of Jack Wrangler until I was researching gay icons of the 1970s. Jack Wrangler was a well-known gay actor of adult entertainment, starring in both gay and straight pornographic films, who married Margaret Whiting, 22 years his senior. Being in competitive and social ballroom dancing, I've witnessed similar unions like this between an older woman and their gay male escorts/dance instructors, so I was intrigued by Mr. Wrangler and Ms Whiting. Wrangler was a rugged, handsome man who tried to find legitimate work in Hollywood and New York. He admitted he didn't have much talent as a singer/dancer, though he said he ""could dance a mean fox trot."" One of his first roles was a in a gay-themed play, ""Special Friends"", playing a male go-go dancer. Life can sometimes imitate art; moving to New York, Jack found work as a go-go dancer and bartender. Go-go dancing led to becoming a male stripper, where he found an appreciative audience; his name derived from the Wrangler brand shirt he was wearing. This ""exposure"" was all he needed for the adult film industry to take notice and offer him roles in gay adult cinema.
Wrangler traces his acting career from being cast as a child in a religious program, his stint at producing and director plays for dinner theater, his salad days as a stripper, to his stardom in many adult films. He speaks of transitioning from gay adult cinema to straight, which caused some of his fans to turn against him. Once he met Margaret Whiting, Jack became less involved in adult films and at one point, Margaret asked him to give it up. He focused on her career and began to write, produce and direct plays for the legitimate theater, which is not surprising, considering his earlier experience with dinner theater. He is very charismatic, even when being interviewed. Clips of his films are featured in this documentary, along with interviews from friends and Ms Whiting as well.",1469577600,,1930,4.833836858006042
8288914,5,B001CR49QG,"Excellent documentary that gives us the life story of one of the most famous 70s gay porn stars who eventually crossed over into mainstream porn.  It really takes the viewer back into the hedonistic era of casual sex before AIDS came along and spoiled the party and the video revolution changed the adult film industry, for better or worse. Jack really bares his soul (no pun intended) as to what drove him to make the choices he made, and his story resonated with me on a very personal level.

The use of 1950s stock footage during his childhood years was a little overdone, but that is the only complaint. Good interviews and cameos from some of the famous ladies of the industry too such as Sharon Mitchell and Gloria Leonard.
