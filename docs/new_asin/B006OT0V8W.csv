I do not agree with those who say this movie had twists; to me, the plot was fairly linear and unraveled in exactly the expected way. This is not to say the film is dull or not worth watching. The tension is achieved well; the acting is very good overall, and above all, the characters act in believable ways, which is unusual in this type of movie. No one character does something that makes you want to yell at them for their idiocy.

While the ""mystery"" is easy to guess, I would not say the movie is predictable, simply because I do not believe the focus of the film was to keep a big secret until the end, but rather to see the main character deal with her situation.

Overall, the film is fun and well-made.",1332374400,5,831,4.280254777070064
8502347,5,B006OT0V8W,"At the core of Claustrofobia, you will find a well paced thriller... a whodunit. It opens with a scene that I found most chilling (a boy and girl in an abandoned morgue. Lured by the girl's sexual promise to climb into one of the boxes, the boy does. As she counts to ten, she locks it and leaves him there). This is not a spoiler, by the way... it's the opening scene and it ran chills through my spine.

Claustrofobia then time warps into the future and becomes a tense whodunit with twists and turns. While there are segments that move slower that one might like, the payoff each time is well worth the pacing that gets you there. The key cast is young and sexy and fun to watch.

There is, by the way, a first in Claustrofobia. The film contains the very first iPad murder scene. How does someone use an iPad as weapon for murder? That would be a spoiler, but you can find the scene if you're interested on Youtube.

The end of Claustrfobia is not predictable. In fact, I am pretty certain no one while watching will drift into the theory that comes to light. The twist is twisted.

Who will like this film? Whodunit fans. Thriller fans. Serial murder fans. Fans of small places. Fans of people who definitely require psychotherapy. Detective story fans.

And... for those that are not partial to sub-titles, don't let them stop you with Claustrofobia. It's well worth the watch.
