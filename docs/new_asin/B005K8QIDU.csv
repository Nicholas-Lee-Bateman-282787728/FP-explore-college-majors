4715598,5,B005K8QIDU,"Really great music video of the greatest Christian rock band.  Visuals, vocals, variety are really great!  It was good to see Doug X Volz with the band since I had only seen live performances with John Schlitt.  These guys are really still better than anything out there in Xn rock.  You won't regret buying this one to complete your collection.",1337040000,9,345,4.7
4715599,5,B005K8QIDU,"OK - I'm sitting here kind of floored. I bought this concert DVD out of curiosity just to see if these old guys could even do half justice to their classic Christian rock songs. After about the 5th song I'm realizing this is maybe the best rock concert DVD I've ever watched (maybe only Rush Time Machine is better). If you've never heard of Petra, then you should check them out even if you know nothing about Christian music. It's just great, great rock, performed with precision, outstanding vocals and superb melodic structure. Good gosh these old guys can play. I own over 400 concert videos - I don't recommend this lightly!",1328659200,29,630,4.633928571428571

4715602,5,B005K8QIDU,"It's great to finally see Greg X. Volz in action after hearing his voice for so many years.  The performances are fantastic and the set list is almost exactly what I would've hand picked myself.  Greg's voice does sound a tad overly ""processed"" (auto tuned?) though.  That bothers me a bit.  Still, I give this five stars because it's just that good.",1420588800,,350,4.596774193548387

4715608,5,B005K8QIDU,"Well, reading the other reviews here provoked me to buy this DVD.

It is truly an excellent production, and captures the musical excellence of Petra, as great in musicianship & encouraging gospel content as when I saw their 'Beat the System' tour live in 1985.

My kids ages 10-19, are re-discovering this now classic Christian Rock for themselves - they love it !  The only problem is it's meaty nature (both musically & lyrically) shows how shallow much of Christian Rock has become.

Praise God for the preservation of this message - due to the updated nature of this production (the sound is superb, just fantastic for a video - I am tempted to go buy a new audio system for our TV just to enjoy it in it's fullne3ss), a new generation can enjoy excellent 'old school' Christian Rock.

The cool thing is, these guys don't play 2nd fiddle to any 'mainstream rock' band - they're on a par with the best in the world.

Thanks Petra - you guys have served the LORD & built up His fellowship in our hearts - and it's fun to rock out and be encouraged in body & spirit !

Thanks for NOT selling out for millions of $$$ and selling out the message (which you could have done, given your talents).

See you soon......David in East Texas",1393804800,2,1232,4.420353982300885
4715609,5,B005K8QIDU,"This DVD is a must have for Petra fans, nice to see they guys I grew up with together one more time. Petra's lyrics are great, due to their faith and never waivering from it.",1391817600,,174,4.0
4715610,5,B005K8QIDU,I have enjoyed all of Petra's music except for two songs. The group is very scripturally sound and is great to listen to,1390089600,2,120,4.260869565217392
4715611,5,B005K8QIDU,"What a surprise! Petra, the band that 30 years ago created the classic albums ""Never Say Die"", ""More Power to Ya"", ""Not of this World"", and ""Beat the System"", are back, rejuvenated, and spot on musically in this concert DVD from 2011. Yes, Petra here truly are on fire and play peerlessly. The audio and video are flawless. And the band plays with precision, excitement and energy. Greg X. Volz was clearly ""in the moment"" with this music as he leaped and moved around on stage like a guy a third his age. Vocals....lead and harmony....were outstanding, really contributing to the enjoyment of this DVD. It's very nice to hear musical, clean, layered vocals (reminiscent of Styx, Queen, Sweet and other bands of yore) in this day and age of growled vocal deliveries. Highlights for me were ""Angel of Light"", ""Clean"", and ""Too Big to Fail"" but really, everything's a highlight on this concert DVD, which is a joy to see and hear...with lyrics that pull no punches and speak truth. PETRA. Who woulda thought, after all these years?!? Never Say Die!",1387065600,6,1046,4.752747252747253
4715612,5,B005K8QIDU,"Why did I rate it this high?  It's the original band!  Older, grayer, but still the best at Christian Rock, love it.",1383696000,,116,4.2272727272727275
4715613,5,B005K8QIDU,"I love Petra and this was a great video to add to my collection. Plus their documentery was a great bonus video that was included.
Well worth the money!",1380672000,,152,4.275862068965517
4715614,5,B005K8QIDU,"I am not going to say a lot here...BUY IT!!!

Some of the best classics, well filmed and sound is good.",1365292800,4,114,4.2272727272727275
4715616,5,B005K8QIDU,I bought the DVD to have a clearer view of this than what is on YouTube. My 6 year old son loves it. He knows all the musicians by name and loves the songs. I had to take video of him pretending to be the bass player and then the lead singer (hilarious).,1363910400,4,254,3.811320754716981
4715617,5,B005K8QIDU,Nothing like sitting down to a few hours of praise music that can make you thankful that you know and love God. These guys put so much heart into their music ministries. They want you to come to know God and love Him like they do. Fantastic! God is so good!,1356739200,4,257,4.0588235294117645
4715618,5,B005K8QIDU,"Love the live video, and especially love the documentary! Very interesting to see the genesis of the group, get to know the guys better and understand what they went through. Five stars--get it now!",1353456000,3,198,4.852941176470588
4715619,5,B005K8QIDU,"Petra has always been one of my favorite bands.  Some more conservative Christians may not like them because of the rock format of their music, but listen to the words......they are Biblically-based, and reflect the joys, struggles, heartaches of every believer.  The songs have real Biblical content....most are based on one or more texts of Scripture.  I still like to listen to them....even at 61 years of age.  This DVD is a must for anyone who enjoys Petra.",1345680000,10,462,4.884615384615385
8476533,5,B005K8QIDU,"This review is actually for the Classic Petra CD, Back to the Rock, but it works for this DVD just as well.  See my comments on the DVD in the last paragraph of this review.

If you are a classic rock junkie like me--always on the lookout for new music with that throwback sound--look no further than this Classic Petra CD, Back to the Rock.  When I first began my pursuit of Christian music as a 20 year-old in the late 1980s, a lot of what I sampled was pretty disappointing.  Understandably, there just wasn't much in the genre able to stand up to the legendary bands I grew up on such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and The Who or 1980s giants like Rush, Styx and Van Halen.

Enter my future wife, who had been following Christian music her whole life.  She had older brothers who were listening to everything available on the market.  She introduced me to Petra in 1989, and now nearly 30 years later, there hasn't been another Christian rock band that has risen to their iconic stature.  From their beginning in the early 1970s, Petra set the standard and paved the way for all of Christian rock.

I have not been aware of any new material from Petra for at least 10 years, and I stumbled on this classic set by accident--I am really glad I did.  With Petra, the Greg X Volz era stands the test of time better than the newer material with John Schlitt on vocals.  The albums from the Volz era have that classic feel that never sound dated.

These new recordings, with all the original members of Petra, are amazing sonically, and I like them all better than the originals--no kidding!  The new tracks have more depth, richness of tone and detail than the original tracks.  My ear can pick-out and focus on each instrument more easily.  I was simply stunned at Gregs vocal ability after all these years.  In a lot of ways, I like his voice better now, because he doesnt sing as consistently in the highest octave any more.  Incidentally, I understand that he is (or was) able to sing in 4 different octaves and was recruited, but declined, to join REO Speedwagon back in the day.  The sound leveling of the mix and overall production of the CD is stellar.

For what its worth, the band produced a live DVD (sorry, no Blu-Ray) of these songs.  The audio and video quality, camera work and production is excellent.  One of the band members, John Lawry, runs his own production studio.  There is also a 2nd excellent band documentary DVD included in the package.  I recently purchased the DVD (which came personally autographed) on Gregs website for less than $20.  I feel like Im undergoing a Petra revival here recently!  Go for it and check out this new material.",1488585600,,2666,4.492723492723493

8476537,5,B005K8QIDU,Why is there not a follow-up album? Why is there no Blu ray? Honestly best performance ever. The behind the scenes DVD was worth the purchase price alone. All the power and message of early Petra laced with today's higher quality recording technology. Back in the day Petra pushed technology boundaries with mixing equipment and even repurposed back masking. This DVD definitely continues that tradition. God Bless Petra. Petra continues to Bless God.,1448755200,,451,5.191780821917808
