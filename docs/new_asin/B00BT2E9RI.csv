5670977,4,B00BT2E9RI,"The video is great, but included shots of the actual birth of the puppies, which didn't interest my 5 year old granddaughter, and was a little gross to watch!  Otherwise, the growing puppies and their antics were cute.  This must have been taken very early in the life of the series, because those seen on television today are a little faster paced and comply with the name - they're mostly cute!",1381536000,6,396,4.563380281690141
5670978,5,B00BT2E9RI,I love this show on TV and loved when I found it for $5 on Amazon. Too good to pass up. Watching puppies play and explore always helps me relax when life is stressful. :),1375747200,,170,3.8857142857142857

5670987,2,B00BT2E9RI,"This is NOT like the ""Too Cute"" episodes aired on the Animal Planet TV station series.  This contains GRAPHIC birth scenes which may upset some viewers.  I am a nurse, and such scenes disturbed my elderly dying patients.  They wanted happy stories, like on the TV show.  This is NOT the same.",1428969600,7,292,4.5576923076923075
5670988,5,B00BT2E9RI,My dogs favorite movie,1427673600,,22,4.75
5670989,3,B00BT2E9RI,"I assumed this would be a collection of many ""Too Cute"" episodes that only involved puppies. There is ONE episode of ""Too Cute"" (which happened to be the only episode I watched previous to buying this -__-). It was mostly a hodge podge of animal planet shows that involved puppies.
3 stars because I wasn't happy with it.
So if you're buying this for ""Too Cute"" episodes, you're better off just buying a season.",1423094400,5,411,4.5675675675675675
5670990,5,B00BT2E9RI,"I am not much of a dog person, but I love to watch them on tv and this show is one of my favorites. This disc not only includes a too cute special on pups but also two episodes from dogs 101. It's all fun to watch and educational. This disc is a must have, especially for dog lovers.",1421107200,,283,3.8135593220338984
5670991,5,B00BT2E9RI,"I haven't played this for my two dachshunds, but my little male saw the episode on an Animal Planet episode and was mesmerized by the puppy sounds....He kept cocking his head from side to side every time a puppy made a sound :-)",1419984000,,228,4.325581395348837

5670993,5,B00BT2E9RI,"It's a DVD about puppies.  Need I say more?

There is an abundance of footage and information about raising certain breeds of dogs.  For animal fans, dog fans, and enthusiasts of the fuzzy and adorable, this DVD is about puppies.  For those looking for information about dogs as pets, this DVD is about puppies.  For those looking for the complete DVD collection of the SAW movies, this is a DVD about puppies.

5670999,3,B00BT2E9RI,"The, probably newer, episodes of TOO CUTE are much better, in my opinion.  Newer ones seem to have little or no birth experience,  which some may feel isn't so graphically needed in this context.",1393632000,8,195,4.705882352941177
5671000,5,B00BT2E9RI,"This movie is so cute, just as it says.  You fall in love with the puppies and kitties.  The DVD is of good quality and it was shipped in a timely fashion.",1393545600,,155,3.8125

8573485,4,B00BT2E9RI,I love the Too Cute Series and this DVD is great but it only contains one full episode and then two little features. I was hoping for more episodes. I guess I misunderstood what I was buying. Still cute but I'd pony up more money for a full season if I had to do it over again.,1494288000,,277,3.8771929824561404
