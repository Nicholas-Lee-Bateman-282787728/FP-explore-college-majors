2460457,4,B000CEV3MS,"""The Hanging Gale"" is everything one might expect from  a BBC production; excellent performances, superb production values and a wonderful Donegal location.

It needs to be pointed out that the previous poster's scepticism re:- what might be expected from BBC Northern Ireland in terms of accuracy and fairness WOULD HAVE been perfectly justified until a few years ago.  While I was growing up in Belfast the SECOND most corrupt public organisation (the Stormont Unionist government being the FIRST) was the BBC.  Foreigners who trust and admire the BBC will have a hard time coming to terms with that fact.  Let them realise that we are talking here about a BBC in Northern Ireland which , at one time, would not tolerate the use of the word ""IRISH"" in its programme titles!  Hard to believe, I know.  It is to the credit of the BBC in London that that situation no longer obtains. However, the shame which Ulster unionists brought on one of Britain's most revered institutions remains a serious blot on the BBC's history.",1142208000,18,1023,4.844827586206897

2460460,2,B000CEV3MS,"I bought this because Michael Kitchen is prominently promoted in it, but he's not in it near enough to justify using him to promote the film. To boot, it's a depressing and repetitive production with scene after scene of pleading, crying, and threatening. The characters are mostly stupid and irresponsible, which makes me not give a damn what happens to them. I wouldn't have paid good money for this had I realized how meatless of a role Kitchen's character is. His performance does not suffer. But the whole foolishness of the story is not worth viewing.",1425686400,11,557,4.8125

2460462,5,B000CEV3MS,"Excellent period piece.  Story of the strife and politics that Irish families suffered in the wake of the famine. People are poor, starving; crops are failing.  Folks had little to no income to afford their rents or buy food. Not exaggerated or embellished, the story follows one particular family's struggles in parallel with an English ""management"" replacement (played superbly by Michael Kitchen).  Kitchen's character at the outset of his arrival in the village only sees the issues from his role as the manager for the owner of the farms; while the families in the local village see him only as the ""outsider"" and ""enforcer"" of the landowner's wishes.  Over time and as events unfold, he comes to feel empathy for the families and struggles with his own feelings of loyalty to his position and the plight of the villagers.",1400803200,5,827,4.928057553956834
2460463,5,B000CEV3MS,"Excellent tutorial on England's ""siege"" of Ireland and the devastating effects on the Irish population. The acting was excellent.

2460464,5,B000CEV3MS,"As an American of Irish descent (of the O'Reagan's) this stupendous series nearly broke my heart as I watched my ancestors being so sorely oppressed.  When Lord Hawksborough offers free America passage to tenants at the end it made me think of 15 year-old Annie Moon who was the first immigrant from Ireland down the gangplank to Ellis Island on January 1, 1892.

""On the first day of January,
Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis Island and they let
The people through.
And first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.""",1385510400,4,1243,4.3405172413793105
2460465,5,B000CEV3MS,"This series brings to mind Woodrow Wilson's comment that film is ""history written in lightning."" Of course, he was talking about ""Birth of a Nation,"" which, although it's a great film, mendaciously tries to justify one of history's great injustices, slavery.
The Hanging Gale is also about one of history's great injustices-- the English exploitation of Ireland that climaxed in the Potato Famine of 1848-- but there is nothing mendacious about it.  Of course, I wasn't there, but the series seems absolutely fair and truthful in its treatment of the tragedy.  It presents Irish brutality and greed along with English, and it is unflinching in its dramatization of a situation that left little room for compassion, honesty, or hope. It's also wonderfully written, produced and acted, and because of that, very worth watching despite its very grim subject. One of the best TV mini-series I've seen.",1384646400,4,897,5.136986301369863
2460466,4,B000CEV3MS,"i'd give the movie 4+ stars because i came away from it with a sense of having been there. This film may idealize the characters a bit, but maybe not. Outcast, wet, ruined, desperate and dying though they were, there is an undercurrent of triumph - principles and compassion didn't quite die in the fight - it's not an entertaining film as such, but i think i've added to my appreciation of the place and time of that potato famine ... and the smell of rotting potatoes. Even though it is a common story in the history of the human race - poor, tired and hungry with nowhere to turn,  i'll watch it again on an inevitable snowed in winter day ahead expecting to learn more. Michael Kitchen seems to craft his characters with a soul of their own - if there's a ""people watcher in you,"" you'll find his portrayal of Captain Townsend interesting.",1354665600,5,843,4.438709677419355

2460475,5,B000CEV3MS,"EXCELLENCE in cast, writing, music, location, and historical truth. This could be called a documentary/fiction. I visited Ireland and did some research into ""The Great Hunger"", or potato famine, and this is spot on. You have to read Irish publications to get truth. I'm absolutely amazed the BBC allowed this. Irish people still are shy in talking about the famine event.

This story focuses on the accounts of a family of 4 boys, the Phelans, and their struggle during the famine years. The story idea was originated with 2 of the 4 McGann brothers that played the 4 Phelan brother roles. In their struggle, the absent landowner sends an agent, Capt. Townsend (wow! played by Michael Kitchen, doing as super as he has done with Foyle's War). Those McGann brothers were equally good in their portrayals as Kitchen was as the man caught between duty and desire to help the poor. There is suspense, mystery, action... and beauty amid the wretchedness.

Having been all over Co. Donegal, Ireland (the origin of my ancestors) I can attest that this footage taken there is exactly how most of the country looks. The wild countryside yet exists. The music by Shaun Davey, placed behind the perfection of acting, costumes (some just like old photographs and written first-hand accounts of the famine years)...well the music is as enthralling as the story. A must see for any Irish, history, & Kitchen fans.

1: Begins in may, 1846, Co. Donegal, and a new land agent replaces a murdered man. He soon finds deplorable conditions for tenants of the estate and a desperate Irish poor. While trying to seize animals in loo of back rent, a farmer is shot. Just as harvest time arrives so does the potato blight.
2: Fr Liam Phelan is returned to Donegal just as the potato crop is lost & records his first instance of death from want. Townsend must begin turning out tenants--11 in all. One, Mary, is hired as his servant. A letter is sent by the United Sons of Freedom, 10 Nov, 1846 sentencing Townsend to death.
3: Daniel, leading USofF, tries to avenge wrongs through violent reactive measures. His brother, Fr. Liam, begs for peace. Conor begs Coulter for a fight to earn $$$. He takes a fight against a Brit soldier ending in consequences. An assassination plot is devised against Townsend. Crisis descends upon the Phelan family.
4: Lord Hawksborough offers free America passage to tenants. Yet famine, starvation, struggle, and death continue. Some proud Irish people refuse to quit. A life/death struggle--a holocaust for many. Desperate days for others. A gritty depiction of Ireland's Great Hunger.

Some nudity, violence, mature audience. NO subtitles or CC, but still worth seeing. I'm so glad I bought this. I'll re-watch it.
Historically accurate according to the Irish books on the famine that I own, and what I witnessed in historical sites in Ireland. The tumble down houses yet lay in waste.",1288396800,8,2895,4.878048780487805
2460476,5,B000CEV3MS,"We absolutely love Michael Kitchen since seeing Foyle's War on PBS.  He is excellent in this movie as well as the the brothers in the story played by 4 actual brothers.  What good acting by everyone!

Highly recommend this movie for the historical story & wonderful cast.",1281657600,7,271,4.723404255319149
2460477,5,B000CEV3MS,"Watched this once and threatened to donate the DVD. Found that I could not due to the haunting nature of the people being portrayed. Unlike another viewer, I was and am somewhat knowledgeable about how the Irish were/are abused by England. Land taken and handed over to the English; Irish landholders made into indentured-like workers on what had been their own land; starvation; poverty; etc. Your sensibilities are assaulted at the unfairness of it all. And the Michael Kitchen character struggles with his own sensibilities in his role as an Englishman.

But bringing history into DVD in a dark photography mode with the highly talended and respected Michael Kitchen, well that really gets you over and over. I am preparing to watch this again, because some form of reality needs to be remembered or I am just anxious to revisit angst. The watching is not comfortable any more than clearly understanding the why or the how of the indominable Irish.",1279756800,12,951,4.94375
2460478,4,B000CEV3MS,Very well done and a shockingly true and well balanced view of the actual experiences of both the Irish people and their English land agent living out a tough life in rural Ireland at the start of the famine.,1266883200,6,208,4.358974358974359
2460479,5,B000CEV3MS,"This four-part film is top-notch.  It is not only the story of the Irish potato famine of two centuries ago, but it is about man's inhumanity to man, about how man is a wolf to man because largely the rich own everything, including the land you live and work on, and including the law, while unprivileged human beings (with no inheritable wealth) are merely serfs, slaves, consumers, ""creatures.""  Michael Kitchen, a wonderful, even adorable actor, plays a dishonorable role in this film, an agent of the rich (in England).  When the Irish Phelan family lose their home and land by Part 3, one wonders what Part 4 can say or illustrate.  It seems as if the film is over at this point.  The finale has been shown and completed.  Part 4, however, is a worthy counterpart to the first three parts.  Do not discount it.  This film is very instructive, by analogy, as to what will or can occur should men and women defend liberty in America now that Global Governance has started it's greedy (carbon trading/vegetarian/GMO foods/international socialism) claims, with the Elite (rich) at the very top giving the orders.  Potatoes anyone?  Or shall everyone just eat cake (if you can afford it)?  Highly recommended, particularly for those who are not egosyntonic.",1264118400,6,1257,4.854460093896714
2460480,2,B000CEV3MS,"The film was, understandably, sad and gloomy. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone because of that. However, from a personal point of view I enjoyed it and the actors were good - especially Michael Kitchen - and the scenery was lovely.",1238371200,5,234,4.7317073170731705
2460481,5,B000CEV3MS,"The Brothers McGann star in this exciting, yet deep film about the four Phelan brothers during the time of the Potato Famine. Though they all lead very different lives, there is the heart and blood ties that keep these four brothers united in one way or another. Michael Kitchen as the new Land Manager is a great asset to this film. If you liked him in Foyle's War, you'll love him in The Hanging Gale!",1193443200,6,403,4.386666666666667
2460482,5,B000CEV3MS,"Until viewing this superb albeit very dark and bloody BBC presentation of ""Hanging Gale"", I had NO idea of the plight of the Irish in the mid-1800s.  This presentation dwells primarily on the struggles of the Phelan family and mainly about the four brothers as played wonderfully by real life brothers, Paul, Stephen, Joe and Mark McGann--who are very rugged and very handsome; with one brother being a rather emtionally torn priest and all of them prone to violence and not above committing murder.  The brothers are trying to deal with the devastation of poverty, starvation, crop failure, etc.  (along with some of the dreariest  weather that I've ever seen on film) that is happening to their family and friends and, of course, that meant dealing with Captain Townsend as played greatly by Michael Kitchen who is a rather ""mild-mannered"" agent for the absent and without a clue land owner.  This 2 disc (two episodes on each disc) mini-series is greatly acted and directed.  I certainly now have more knowledge and understanding of what happened to the Irish during the time being depicted.

Be advised that this is no cushy ""Hallmark"" presentation.  It is a very harsh and realistic presentation that never lets up from its depiction of some very grim times.  If you love good drama that will leave you weak in the knees from emotional exhaustion, buy these DVDs.",1189987200,30,1368,4.887445887445887
2460483,5,B000CEV3MS,"Set in County Donegal, Ireland, just prior to and during the Irish Potato Famine in the mid 1800s, The Hanging Gale is a powerful and emotionally charged, not to mention insightful and informative, account of one family's struggle to survive the devastation--a situation made only worse by the cruel and unbending governance by the British.

The series stars the four McGann brothers as the four Phelan brothers.  Brother Liam (Paul McGann--Withnail and I, Horatio Hornblower, Fish) is a Catholic priest, a man whose faith is sorely tried throughout the family's ordeal; while Daniel (Stephen McGann), a passionate and angry young man with a dangerous secret, is a school teacher.  Brothers Sean (Joe McGann) and Conor (Mark McGann--The Grand) live and work with their father on the family farm, along with Sean's wife, Maeve, and their small children.  The Phelan's holding is a small one and is one of many let by Lord Hawksborough, a highly unsympathetic, avaricious absentee British landowner--a man whom we never see, but whose presence (not to mention iron will) is represented by his agent.

The series opens with the murder of the agent by a radical and dangerous group of Irish vigilantes.  Enter Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War) as Captain Townsend, the new agent.  Townsend is appalled by what he sees and is sympathetic to the plight of the Irish tenants, but he is not the landowner.  His duty is to his Lordship--to manage the property and collect the rents on his Lordship's behalf.  Apart from writing to his master to inform him of the situation and to make requests on behalf of the tenants, there is little that Townsend is able to do.  It is Townsend's good nature that creates the tremendous tension in this splendid series, for we are torn as we sympathize with both the Phelans (and the other tenants) as their situation goes from bad to worse and with Townsend, whose hands are tied.

I don't wish to delve in detail about the complexities of the plot and the twists and turns that it takes as I don't wish to spoil anyone's enjoyment of this fine series.  Suffice it to say that the series (produced in 1995 and consisting of four 50-minute episodes) is a captivating--indeed riveting--historical drama that will keep one on the edge of one's seat and waiting in anticipation for the next episode.  It has the added benefit of being educational and informative, and it provided much in the way of conversation for our family in between episodes.  As should be obvious, this is a heavy series, but it is not one that will be soon forgotten, and I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys top quality (and well-acted) historical drama.  I would go further, however, and recommend it to anyone looking for a good, captivating drama, full stop.

Very highly recommended!",1146787200,68,2788,4.862579281183932
