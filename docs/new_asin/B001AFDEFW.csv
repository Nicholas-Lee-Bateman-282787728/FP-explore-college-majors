In addition to all of the excellent stand-up comedy, this DVD also has almost 15 minutes of absolutely hilarious bonus material, including one of the worlds only comedy DVD alternate endings! If you are wanting some quality stand up comedy without all the filth that seems to accompany so much of todays humor, then this stand-up comedian is the one for you. His delivery is flawless and his material is laugh-out-loud funny. I enjoyed this DVD immensely and am looking forward to his next one!",1400025600,,586,4.811881188118812
8277280,5,B001AFDEFW,"This is without a doubt one of the best comedy videos I've ever seen, Christian or otherwise. There are so many things I love about this DVD its hard to know where to start. First, Mr. Marshalls material is all original and not a bit of it is racy or unfit for the family. I love that his humor is good enough for any main stream audience but is also suitable for a church service. Second, I really like his approach and delivery. Although he is apologetically southern, he doesn't do redneck jokes or trade on the southern culture. Last, but certainly not least, I like that he delivers a heartfelt, seeker-friendly testimony toward the end. He makes a point of not being preachy, or pushing his faith on anyone, while still communicating his love and faith in God. This DVD is a sure bet and worth every bit of the asking price and more!",1400025600,,839,4.419354838709677
8277281,2,B001AFDEFW,"There was some of his stuff that wasn't a very Christianly kind of example. One him talking bout watching Jerry Springer a few times, it was one of his skits. Also talking of a person in his family being a pharmacist, cause he had a meth lab. That wasn't funny. And while I realize that you can't control the clothes your audience wears, you can control where the camera goes, and they had a woman wearing a dress that had more of her breast showing than not and kept showing it all at least twice in a row. Once they did just focus on her face. I would expect this from a secular comedy show, but for one boasting a Christian comedy, I would expect better editing. If everybody isn't ready to start their movie yet, but you put it inside ur player, I'd suggest pushing mute. Cause hearing him do the mic check over and over in their loop, is tiring to hear while waiting on others to be ready. Oh, he also does joke about suing the place he rented to do their show in bonuses. As for his comedy beyond that. Some is really funny and I did get a good laugh at some parts and other parts wasn't that great. My husband liked it alright and one of my son's mentioned it wasn't as funny as he hoped. I felt they same way. Now I hope to one day sell it, cause I'm not thinking any of us will really miss it. My youngest son 14 didn't laugh much either. I'd guess they'd all give it a two or three, but I gave it two, cause when on stage in front of possibly billions, you really have to be extra mindful of how much Christ, representing you're doing, so you don't lead others astray. Now if a non Christian or even Christian who isn't very grounded in God watches this they could be influenced that what we watch such as Jerry Springer really doesn't matter and that's far from Truth.",1390521600,,1779,4.174418604651163
