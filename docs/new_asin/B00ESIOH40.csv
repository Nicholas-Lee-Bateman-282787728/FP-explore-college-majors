8608931,1,B00ESIOH40,It was aweful. I sent it back and asked for a refund. It was a DVD copy of old VCR tapes from what looked like the 1980's. VERY poor picture quality and VERY boring. Was basically unusable. Try and get a teenager from our modern culture to pay attention and learn from this. Not going to happen. As you can tell I was very disappointed. 1 star is not low enough.,1489622400,,362,4.112676056338028
