3798773,5,B001UHOWX8,"White Christmas is perhaps the most delightful holiday movie ever made.  All of the songs are wonderful and showcase the talents of the actors.  It is an excellent family movie - one that can be enjoyed not only at  Christmas, but throughout the year.  I have seen many old movies, a large  number of them musicals, and this one rates among the highest of my  favorites, both for story line and songs and music.  Its a can't miss,  all-around great show.",913766400,,454,4.518518518518518
3798774,4,B001UHOWX8,"Here's a semi-remake of ""Holiday Inn"" (1942), with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire.
In this one, Bing and Danny Kaye play a couple of ex-soldiers who become a show business sensation after the Second World War. They work their way up to big-time Broadway producers. On a road trip, they meet up with the Haynes sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney).
The boys follow the Haynes sisters to Vermont, where they're doing a show at a local inn. It turns out that the inn is run by the boys' ex-Army General. Seems that the ""Old Man"" is in a jam, on account of there being no snow for the ski crowd, and the inn is practically empty. So the four entertainers decide to put on a show to help save the day for the General.
Fine performances all around, and some pretty good (if uneven) dance numbers. Mary Wickes plays a delightful busybody, and Vera-Ellen and Danny Kaye light up the screen.
The movie is fine family entertainment, but only so-so as a musical. It also contains one of the least believeable lines in movie history. Rosemary Clooney, to Mary Wicks, on learning that the inn is in hard times financially: ""Oh, please! Couldn't you tell the General that we don't want to be paid? We wouldn't want to be paid if the inn is doing so poorly!"" Can you imagine a show person, living show-to-show, asking not to be paid?!
Anyway, lots of good dances and a few good tunes, like ""Snow"" and ""Count Your Troubles"", and of course, Bing crooning ""White Christmas"".",883785600,5,1459,4.551330798479087

Danny Kaye is fantastic as are the other actors.  It is so nice to watch a movie that is decent.  No scenes with immorality, numerous swear words and violence.

3798824,3,B001UHOWX8,"The 1954 WHITE CHRISTMAS began as a project to reunite Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, who had previously co-starred in the Irving Berlin musicals HOLIDAY INN and BLUE SKIES. When Astaire declined, he was replaced by Donald OConnor; when OConnor became ill, he was replaced by Danny Kaye. Since Kaye was not a top level dancer, musical numbers choreographed for OConnor were performed with Vera-Ellen by dancer John Brasca. Rosemary Clooney, Dean Jagger, Mary Wickes, and Anne Whitfield round out the leading cast, and Barrie Chase and future Oscar-winner George Chakiris appear in small roles.

Crosby and Kaye are WWII G.I.s whose friendship evolves into a popular song and dance stage act. Clooney and Vera-Ellen are a sister act who cross their paths. The four go to a winter resort in Vermont owned by Crosby and Kayes former commanding officerand discover there is no snow and the resort is in danger of closure. But it just so happens that the resort has a Broadway-style stage, and quite naturally they decide to put on a show. Romantic complications ensue, but the ending is inevitably happy, complete with long awaited snow, Christmas trees, and the cast singing White Christmas.

The performers are expert and attractive, the production values excellent, the cinematography appealing, and director Michael Curtiz gives the thing a handsome look and a good tempo. Even so, the film has a bland cottage cheese quality. The Berlin score is not among his best; excepting White Christmas (which debuted twelve years earlier) none of the songs are especially memorable.  Vera-Ellen and John Brasca are spectacular dance partners, but their dance numbers fail to linger in mind. The plot is a collection of clichs, and the script lacks wit. White Christmas may have been the top grosser of its year, but seen today, it is only mildly entertaining and completely unmemorable.

3798876,3,B001UHOWX8,"Men were in war together. One was a famous NYC entertainer. The other a wannabe. The wannabe saved the entertainer's life during an air raid. Then after the war they teamed up and became a famous duo entertainment act. The one meets two girls. He gets them in on the act at a resort in VT.

I appreciated 3 things in this movie. Danny Kay as a young goodlooking man not the creepy scary looking one I knew him to be. A beautiful ""modern"" VT Inn setting. It wasn't common to see such a nice place in movies back then. And more of the era where men and women dressed appropriately acted appropriately and talked appropriately. America appears to be so lost in his tattoos, body showing, sweat suit wearing, foul mouth talking, obesity showing culture of today.

But the plot line was just too goofy. The lines were just snoozing. The ""acts"" where they danced and sang were stupid. The characters were not very attractive. Yes I said Danny Kay was goodlooking. But that was for him. When they showed his legs . . . eeewww. And Vera Ellen . . . with those bony bow legs and that weird shaped head of hers. She looked like a woman in her 80s trying to play a part in her 20s/30s. Clooney was never good looking to me and Crosby wasn't either. When the two women dance with those feathers . . . just dumb. . . and what a dumb song too. Anyway the plot was just too forced. It was like we are told to find romance between the characters when there isn't any. We are told to find the ""confusion"" that created the tension when it could have easily been cleared up. But of course wasn't or there would be no movie.

I think this movie is one of those movie that is a bigger deal because of Bing Crosby's Hollywood persona than the movie deserves. It reminds me of The Wizard of Oz. We are all supposed to be so fond of it. Sorry. I'm not fond of that movie either.",1514764800,,1854,4.216901408450704

However, please be aware when purchasing the Diamond Anniversary Edition 4-disc set: while both Amazon as well as the back side of the Blu-ray's slipcover states that this is a 4-disc set with a ""BONUS 12-SONG CHRISTMAS CD"" included... this is NOT the case!!! I was disappointed to not find the CD, as it was the aspect to convince me to buy it this Christmas (I already own an earlier edition).  I would like to figure out how to rectify this matter - whether it's for Amazon or Paramount to resolve this... ???

I've attached a photo showing the slipcover stating the CD info, next to the back side of the actual case (which makes no mention of the CD?). My guess is that this is mis-packaged with a 3-disc version of the set, at least this recent batch.

Another reviewer has already posted about this same issue, and tried a replacement/exchange with Amazon to just receive the same thing, so that's obviously not going to solve the problem.

In 2009, I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Christmas-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B002MU4NN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Christmas Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;with an additional DVD of bonus features, and replaced it with the new Diamond Anniversary Edition in 2014. I did not have a Blu-ray player then; otherwise I would have purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B00MMPB45Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;edition.

Bing Crosby (Captain Bob Wallace), Danny Kaye (Private Phil Davis), Rosemary Clooney (Betty Haynes), and the always underrated dancer Vera-Ellen (Judy Haynes) are in top form. While not all of Irving Berlin's songs in this film are top-drawer, most are first-rate. Character actor Dean Jagger plays the gruff General Tom Waverly, the boys' former Army commander, who now owns the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, whom the four principals save from financial ruin by performing their show at the inn.  The second disc contains all of the bonus features from previous editions, plus a few new ones, including a ""virtual duet"" between Bing and Michael Bubl. Rosemary Clooney's poignant commentary track from 2000 remains intact on the main DVD. The other documentaries include featurettes about Bing and his childhood home, Danny Kaye's life, including his showbiz career and his humanitarian work, the making of the movie and the writing of the song itself, a retrospective look back with the late Rosemary Clooney, a tour of Clooney's Kentucky home, the transformation of the film into a stage musical (see below) and a 1954 UNICEF documentary, ASSIGNMENT: CHILDREN,  with Danny Kaye (introduced by Michael Bubl - the documentary can be played with or without the intro). There are also two theatrical trailers and several photo galleries. I had more detailed information in the review that was wiped; I tried to remember as much as could - my apologies to other customers for leaving any details out.

HISTORICAL NOTE: WHITE CHRISTMAS was the first movie released in Paramount Pictures' new widescreen format, VistaVision, which unlike its competitors, CinemaScope and Cinerama, was compatible with existing theaters and projection equipment. WHITE CHRISTMAS was supposed to be the third Bing Crosby/Fred Astaire musical for Paramount, following 1942's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-Inn-Blu-ray/dp/B074Q1PKCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday Inn (Blu-ray)</a>&nbsp;and 1946's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Skies/dp/B07485FCT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Skies</a>, but Astaire turned it down because he had just completed filming MGM's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Band-Wagon-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007939MK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Band Wagon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and wanted to spend time with his family before starting another film project. Other accounts claim that Astaire had another commitment, was either ill or injured, and that he believed was too old for the part. Donald O'Connor was originally signed as Astaire's replacement, but suffered an injury, so Danny Kaye ended up with the role of a lifetime.

I watched the bonus disc again recently. Here are a few more details:

1) Bing's 1976 performance of ""White Christmas,"" where he sings the seldom-heard opening verse. This was the last TV performance of the song aired during Crosby's lifetime; the 1977 special, BING CROSBY'S MERRIE OLDE CHRISTMAS, featuring the ""Peace On Earth"" / ""The Little Drummer Boy"" duet with the late David Bowie, aired after Bing's death.

2) The unadulterated 1971 performance of ""White Christmas,"" without Michael Bubl, is from the NBC special, BING CROSBY: THE SOUNDS OF CHRISTMAS. This special, the 1977 special, and two earlier specials from 1961 and 1962, are available on the DVD collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bing-Crosby-The-Television-Specials-Volume-2/dp/B0041EVYYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bing Crosby: The Television Specials, Volume 2</a>, which I own.

3) There is also a 1948 black-and-white performance of Bing singing ""Silent Night,"" with a boys' choir. I don't believe this is available elsewhere.

4) There are two performances featuring Danny Kaye - one in black-and-white from 1963, featuring Danny and the late great Nat ""King"" Cole duetting on a jazzy version of ""Jingle Bells,"" and a color performance from 1965, featuring Kaye's reading of an excerpt from Charles Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL. Both of these performances are available on the DVD collection,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-With-Danny-Kaye/dp/B00914ETQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas With Danny Kaye</a>, which I also own.

This musical was later transformed into a stage play (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irving-Berlin-s-White-Christmas/dp/B000ICLTFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irving Berlin's White Christmas</a>). I purchased the original cast CD in 2010, and saw the stage play at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in December 2012. If the play comes to your area, go see it; it is excellent.

The aforementioned HOLIDAY INN, starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, was recently made into a Broadway musical (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-Inn-Original-Broadway-Cast-Recording/dp/B06XWFCGDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday Inn (Original Broadway Cast Recording)</a>), which I own as well. An excellent television version was recently broadcast on PBS' GREAT PERFORMANCES series. Check your local listings or the PBS Web site for air times. A DVD/Blu-ray version of the same performance is available as a bonus disc with the 75th Anniversary Edition of the original movie.

I hope modern Hollywood never remakes this film. While there are contemporary performers who could do it justice - Michael Bubl, Kristin Chenoweth, Jane Krakowski, Sutton Foster, Harry Connick, Jr., and young dancers such as tappers Melinda Sullivan and Sarah Reich, to name a few - the last thing we need is to turn WHITE CHRISTMAS into a hip-hop mess, as Will Smith recently did with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Blu-ray/dp/B00R878NI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie (Blu-ray)</a>.  The hip-hop generation has HAMILTON; that is enough.

Five stars for this terrific film.",1512864000,10,7398,6.864749733759319

I love Danny Kaye in anything he does, but Bing shows his age in this movie, and it's really hard for me to imagine him as the love interest for Rosemary Clooney. Of course, Bing's singing in the movie is good, but his rendition of ""White Christmas"" in this movie can't hold a candle to the way he sings it in the 1942 ""Holiday Inn,"" which incidentally is the movie that introduced the song. As far as Vera-Ellen, her dancing was okay in this movie, but she looks impossibly thin, especially when you compare her performances to those in some of her other movies, such as ""On the Town"" for one. ""White Christmas"" is entertaining viewing, but to me the plot is very thin. The big gem in this movie, though, is ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep.""

3798946,5,B001UHOWX8,"We've been watching White Christmas as a seasonal tradition since the very first VHS of it was available, and have owned VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray editions of the film. Before that we made sure to catch it on TV, and I've personally watched the film every year since the early 70s.

The Irving Berlin score is wonderful. You can't beat Bing Crosby singing any song, and in particular his recording of White Christmas was the number one sold song for many decades. Danny Kaye is very funny, and several of the clever exchanges between Danny and Bing make me chuckle every time I see the film. The story is light but warm, as the film is actually more of a light romantic comedy than a holiday film, but combines both elements in satisfying fashion.

As many times as I have seen this film, I've never seen a presentation that rivaled our experience of viewing the Blu-ray version. Colors that I never noticed before just pop out of the screen. In particular the red hues are much stronger than in any other presentation I've viewed. It is simply gorgeous. As an example, in the sequence where Danny and Bing go to see the sisters' performance, during the ""Sisters"" number there is a red flower on their table. By the time the sisters change and join them for a chat, the flowers on the table have magically changed to orange flowers. In more than 40 years of watching this film I'd never noticed that before, but with the vivid color presentation of the Blu-ray, you can't miss it.

The sound quality is also terrific. White Christmas has had a HiFi sound track since its first VHS release, but my impression is that this was the best we've ever heard it sound. It is possible that it sounds no better than the DVD, and we were being carried along by the ""honeymoon"" of the Blu-ray experience, but either way, it had a great sound.

If you treasure this film as we do, I obviously highly recommend that you move up to the Blu-ray version if you have a Blu-ray player.",1503273600,5,1966,4.483240223463687

But it was on VHS - seeing it now she was blown away by the quality of the DVD -  and that was made from the movie which was made a long time ago.
I must admit that the colors are a little bit brighter than real life, but this is what directors did when color movies first came out in large numbers.

The dancing is fabulous and rivals Bing's crooning.",1493856000,,411,4.061728395061729

3799060,4,B001UHOWX8,"Classic seasonal movie though obviously totally secular. Storyline and camaraderie is reflective of the post WWII era movies. Humor is classic as well with the two lead characters of Crosby and Kaye, and it comes from an era when actors were so versatile and many well-trained in music, dance, and acting. NOT what you see today. There are a few dance numbers which have a sultry undertone and costuming, but not horrible. Just beware of those depending on who is watching the movie.",1484092800,,483,4.831325301204819

3799122,5,B001UHOWX8,"Several years ago a locally-owned video store in my area was closing its doors and liquidating its inventory.  It was at that time that I purchased a well-used copy of Irving Berlin's holiday classic ""White Christmas"" on DVD for $2.00.  This particular item was designated the ""Anniversary Edition"" and had been released sometime around the year 2000.  Each and every December my wife and I would make it a point to view it and over time it has become one of our favorite films.  After all, what's not to like?  Just a few days ago we sat down to enjoy ""White Christmas"" one more time.  Unfortunately the film got stuck in the third scene and nothing we tried seemed to correct the problem.  It was time to order a new copy.

Lo and behold, within just three days we received our new copy of ""White Christmas"" in the mail from Amazon.  Great service!  This new edition released in 2014 has been dubbed the ""Diamond Anniversary Edition"".  We were pleased to discover that Paramount has put together an impressive collection of great new features for this release.  In fact, the special features included in Disc 2 add nearly two hours of informative and highly entertaining material to this package.  Then there is the remastered film itself.  it is simply incredible.  We do not have a HDTV but we found the video quality to be nothing short of stunning.  In retrospect we are very grateful that our old copy wore out.  Hopefully, my wife and I will be enjoying ""White Christmas:  Diamond Anniversary Edition"" for many years to come.  The folks at Paramount have outdone themselves with this one.  Very highly recommended!",1483056000,23,1622,4.725

The enhanced resolution of the VistaVision photography is obvious from the first scene where Bing sings ""White Christmas,"" and the colors are mind-glowingly wonderful. The liquid satin gowns in the finale look as sumptuous as they likely did in person.

The movie is enchanting and perfection itself, an incredibly sweet story that gets far too little airtime at Christmas.

Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy and avoid the commercials and resolution drop of cable or satellite.",1482019200,,565,5.119565217391305

Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye lead a stellar cast, while Michael Curtiz directs. Some of the sets look pretty fake, but this film doesn't suffer because of that; the colorful surroundings and colorful characters make up for this slight deficiency. There are a lot of recognizable musical numbers, most notably White Christmas, of course. The special features on the blu ray are excellent, and really worth your time.

We bought this pack, never intending to watch the Blu-Ray disc, as so many old films on Blu-Ray have been ruined (quality-wise) when they are transferred to BR Disc. However, we tried this one on a lark and it was amazing! Now it is the way we watch it all the time! The colour is so much better and they really look real! the sound is fabulous and you'll find yourself re-watching numbers or wanting to just re-watch the whole film as soon as you finish!

On Blu-ray, it finally looks as it should with VistaVision's motion picture high fidelity shining through. A crystal clear, color-saturated image looking lush and lovely. It's always been a source of regret Paramount's original recording sessions for this score did not survive the dumping down to mono. We get a rechanneled effort at faux stereo, but honestly, the restored mono mix is more satisfying herein. Regurgitated extras from a previous release, augmented by a CD sampler of the stars singling Christmas carols not indigenous to the movie's release is the only NEW extra. Bottom line: a must have.

When the General walks into the dinning area and is met by some of his old platoon.  Danny Kaye has always been a favorite of mine, since his T.V. show back in the early 1960s.  I love Rosemary Clooney's voice and am searching out any recordings I can get of her at her best.  She was a heavy smoker so when she teamed up with Barry Manilow to record Green Eyes her voice wasn't the same and she couldn't put the power behind it like days of old.  I also learned that Vera-Ellen was anorexic and that is why you always see her in a turtle neck or some other form of style to hide the neck.  Because of her condition the neck appears old and they couldn't show that.  She was a fantastic dancer and where she got her energy from is beyond all understanding.  I can't wait to get the anniversary edition of this movie.  Christmas is not Christmas without White Christmas.",1458604800,,1009,4.2356020942408374

3799460,5,B001UHOWX8,"It's ""White Christmas"" with Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby!  What more can I say?!  Okay,...it's the classic that millions of people look forward to every December for the music, dance, drama, and hilarious comedy of Danny Kaye.  With Danny Kaye, you don't need anyone else, but they added Bing and two pretty ladies to the mix.  I have loved this movie since I was a child, and now I own it so I can share it any time of the year with my daughter, sister, niece, and any grandchildren that may come along later.  It's one of those classics that every movie lover should own, or at least have access to.  (Yes, I'll loan it to friends, provided they put some collateral down, like a car or a diamond tiara!)

I can't call it a Christian movie, because the truth of the Bible is missing, i.e., the REAL Christmas story of the birth of Jesus Christ.  It is a movie, however, that you can safely show to your family.  This is a truly decent, lovely movie which is happily lacking the filthy language common to most of the current movies and TV.  It's a true family classic, and it's the perfect movie with which to settle down with a cup of cocoa and slice of toast -- a great comfort classic.  I love it and highly recommend it.",1453593600,,1222,4.315789473684211

3799514,5,B001UHOWX8,"This is a 1954 Holiday musical.  It is really a very fine movie.  Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera Ellen are wonderful.  Vera Ellen is one of the best female dancers in Hollywood History.  When she gets really serious they bring in John Brascia to dance with her.  If one wishes to see him again, see him dance with Cyd Charisse in ""Meet Me In Las Vegas"".

My family and I watch this movie every Christmas Eve Evening.  We have done so for ears.  We basically have the movie memorized.  We thoroughly enjoy t and often make jokes using lines from the movie during the year.  It sort of makes our family feel closer.  Thank You...",1451174400,,648,4.406779661016949

3799519,5,B001UHOWX8,"The Bluray is worth buying even if you are like me and own multiple other copies. The color is vivid, everything is in sharp detail, and the sound is richer. I have watched this movie for 40+ years in every format which has been available, including re-release in the theater, and this is the best viewing experience outside of the theater I've ever seen. If you love this movie, buy the Diamond Anniversary edition on bluray. You will not be disappointed.",1450742400,,456,4.6419753086419755

3799564,4,B001UHOWX8,"This is a great family movie, especially if you watch it every year at Christmas time like we do. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye make a great team, Bing doing the singing (along with many trademark Crosby turns of phrase) and Danny doing the joking and some dancing. There's lots more to be said about the movie, of course: read IMDB or wikipedia.

The DVD version itself is ok. The biggest disappointment was in the special features. They have 2 theatrical trailers and an interview with Rosemary Clooney, which are ok. But the commentary track is, I hate to say, really bad. Basically it consists of Rosemary chuckling at different points in the movie. She reveals a few interesting tidbits, but by and large it's extremely disappointing. We were looking forward to lots of stories about the cast and crew, verification of trivia we had read, but simply got a few reminiscences about her and Bing Crosby and a bunch of chuckling.

Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby look more like Lon Chaney doing an ad for Phantom of the Opera. The video is OK. Filmed in VistaVision, this version, disappointingly, doesn't have the width of the original release.

Also, too many times it is on a channel that has numerous commercials.  With the DVD, we can watch it when WE want, and without commercials.

This is a holiday classic full of schmaltz, but it stands the test of time. Danny Kay and Bing Crosby singing ""Sisters"" still makes me laugh even though I have watched this movie countless times. Rosemary Clooney's velvety voice and Ellen Vera's pulse taps are amazing. This movie has become part of our family's holiday traditions.",1422057600,,459,4.679012345679013

Plus it has some of my favorite old movie actors (Rosemary Clooney, Danny Kaye, Bing Crosby and Vera Ellen), and is a fun musical romp from beginning to end! Danny Kaye was a comic genius who could also sing and dance, and Vera Ellen was such a totally amazing dancer that it's worth watching this movie just for her performances. (Best: near the beginning of the movie, ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing."") Makes me yearn for a simpler time!",1420243200,,622,4.417391304347826

3799869,5,B001UHOWX8,"There are a handful of movies in my collection that I pay to update when they become available in a newer or better format and White Christmas is one of those. Last year I upgraded to a blu ray player and 51' plasma TV and discovered that the DVD version that I owned was much grainier than I had remembered on my old analog TV. I made a few inquiries on a video collector's board and they told me that the Diamond Anniversary Edition blu ray/dvd combination would be a significant upgrade for me. Amazon had it at a great price so I gave it a try and, holy cow, were the folks on the collectors board right!!!!! The colors and clarity are just incredible. I saw things that I'd never noticed before, such as the small sparkling rhinestones in the blue fans in the ""Sisters"" number (I've even seen one of those fans in a museum and hadn't noticed the sparkles!), the detailing on Rosemary Clooney's earrings in the ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" scene, the depth of color in the layers of Rosemary and Vera's dresses (the dress that Vera wore in ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"") and a thousand other small details. The sharpness of this copy is just wonderful.
This edition comes with a blu ray, a DVD and a CD of songs from the movie. The CD isn't a soundtrack (as we all know, there IS no official White Christmas soundtrack but, I'll stay focused and not go off on a rant about that) but is Bing, Danny and Rosemary singing their own versions of some of the songs, with Michael Buble thrown in. Some people don't see the need to have a release that has both a DVD AND Blu Ray but, personally, I like it. I tend to visit a lot over the holidays and always take some of my favorite movies with me and not everyone has a blu ray player.
So, to sum it up, if you are a die hard White Christmas fan, THIS is the version for you!!!",1420156800,3,1845,4.229461756373937

3799879,5,B001UHOWX8,"I've watched ""White Christmas"" countless times, always around the holiday season. It's almost as old as I am !  Though the acting is sometimes cheesy and the plot completely contrived to set up the musical numbers, I still love every minute of this movie. The singing, dancing and choreography are just stunning. The big scene at the end where the doors open up to reveal snow falling on the Vermont inn always makes me cry, as does the tribute to the General.

The big musical is a lost genre in Hollywood, but thanks to streaming video and remastered films we can enjoy them over and over. My only criticism is that ""White Christmas"" is obviously shot on the Hollywood back lots rather than on location - had it been filmed on location, the scenery would have been as stunning as the singing and dancing.",1420070400,,806,4.590277777777778

3799898,5,B001UHOWX8,"I won't bore you with a detailed description of the storyline we all already know and love.

How Pvt Davis (Danny Kaye) saves Cpt Wallace's (Bing Crosby) life during their forward deployment as part of the 151st Infantry Division in 1944. After which Davis imposes himself upon Wallace to join his song and dance act, together becoming nationally famous. During a break after their last show before Christmas some 10 years later in Florida, they see an act, the Haynes Sisters, and meet Betty and Judy (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) deciding to join them to a Vermont ski lodge instead of their original plans in New York. Upon arriving in Pine Tree, Vermont, they discover that the lodge is owned by their old beloved General Waverly (Dean Jagger), but the resort is going through hard times due to the unseasonably warm weather. So Wallace and Davis decide to bring their act up to Vermont to put on a Christmas show. Sprinkle in some budding romance (Bob Wallace, Betty Haynes), interfering friends (Phil Davis, Judy Haynes), and misunderstandings which all then build up to the grand finale of a 10th year reunion of the 151st and the extravaganza rendition of ""White Christmas.""

Oops, I did it again. My wife says I talk too much...

I gave this movie 5 stars. What did I like about it? All the catchy hum aloud tunes -- ""White Christmas,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Sisters,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" and ""Snow Snow Snow"" to name a few.  An interesting look at behind the scenes production of a show. The dress rehearsals comprising vignettes of the final show. The dancing in the dress rehearsal called ""Minstrel.""

And all the classic lines in the movie --
Phil Davis: ""Boy, girl, boy girl? It's cozier, isn't it?""

Novello: ""How's your coffee holding up?""
Sheriff: ""Yeah, warm it up a little.""

Phil Davis: ""How much is 'wow'?""
Bob Wallace: ""Somewhere between 'ouch' and 'boing'.""

Phil Davis: ""My dear partner, when what's left of you gets around to what's left to be gotten, what's left to be gotten won't be worth getting, whatever it is you've got left.""

The film is bookended by two different renditions of ""White Christmas,"" but I personally like the music box version at the beginning better.

(SPOILER ALERT) I'm sure there was not a dry eye in the house at the end of the movie when the troops stood to attention ready for inspection, and the general's adjutant tells him, ""Just routine, sir.""",1419897600,,2452,4.789099526066351

My 8 year old son absolutely loved it, too, and we watched it several more times at home via free internet streaming. This was our first introduction to Danny Kaye, and we became quick fans, enjoying his performance in Court Jester just a few months later.  Anyhow, Christmas was upon us again, and much to my disappointment, I was unable to stream White Christmas. Thankfully, the dvd was available at a great price. Can't rate it highly enough. This will become an annual tradition. (And my next Danny Kaye movie to try out will by Secret Life of Walter Mitty!)",1419206400,,672,4.463414634146342
3799965,1,B001UHOWX8,The movie was great as expected. The visual quality of it was horrible. I have seen this on TV many times and it was never like this. Perhaps the HD version distorted the film somehow. It was pixilated and slow to transition as if there was a digital delay. My suggestion....buy the video.,1419206400,,289,4.471698113207547

3799970,5,B001UHOWX8,"I'm not a fan of double dipping, unless there are noticable improvements.  I won't bore you with a movie review - I know a lot of people like myself just want to skip to the chase and find out if it's worth buying again.  I can tell you the difference between the last blu-ray release and this one is pretty amazing.  Colors pop and the picture is razor sharp.  I noticed none of the fuzziness that marred the last release.  The sound quality has also been markedly improved - so much so that it almost hurts the movie - there is a huge and noticable difference in the sound of the actor's voices when they burst into a song - of course the vocals are not live and were either pre-recored or dubbed in later - it's just that the difference between their speaking voices and the recorded vocals is so magnified by the perfection of the audio track that it's actually a little bit distracting.  Still, for a movie this old - this is about as near-perfect as you could ever ask for.  Definitely worth buying the upgrade - no question about it.",1419206400,3,1040,4.329896907216495
3799971,5,B001UHOWX8,"Always a delight--still a classic.  Lovely bit parts by Dean Jagger as General Waverly and Mary Wicks as the Housekeeper.  Perhaps Rosemary Clooney's finest film:  she's sounds like a smooth Christmas liqueur and looks like a luscious bit of Christmas marzipan.  The finale of White Christmas, probably the biggest selling most popular American Christmas song ever, is still heartwarming no matter how many times you see it.  A great family film:  great songs by Irving Berlin, great dancing by Vera Ellen and company, Danny Kaye at his smarmy charming talented best, and Bing Crosby crooning like always.

I am not totally sure what else I can say it looks like over 1000 people like this movie,so you know it's got to be a great one. I will admit I don't have much patience for movies around a certain time period to me they seem slow,but I like White Christmas despite the singing and dancing. The songs were decent songs and I like watching the dancing especially when I saw Vera Ellen and Danny Kaye dancing just the two of them. Those two really know how to dance as,well as sing. I like at times when Bing Crosby,Rosemary Clooney,Vera Ellen and Danny Kaye all sang together. I liked when they sang the song snow together the best. I also liked when Bing Croby sang Blessings to Rosemary Clooney,There were so many cute scence in general in that movie to many to name. Great story line and the main characters were cute together. Bing Crosby was cute with Rosemary Clooney and Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen as well. The perfect combinations.

3800108,5,B001UHOWX8,"White Christmas has often been compared to Holiday Inn, the film that first introduced Bing Crosby's greatest hit recording. White Christmas, however, is much more than just a retelling of the Holiday Inn story. The music is better integrated into the plot; the story is better, and there is no comparison to the Vista Vision color screen process used in the film. When I first saw it, I was astounded at the 3D depth of field seen in the closing number (3D illusion without the glasses that were standard at the time).

For me, this is the one holiday movie that I want to see every Christmas. Irving Berlin's musical numbers are outstanding; Vera Ellen's and Danny Kaye's dancing spectacular (I even know all the words to ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" though I can't dance a lick); and Crosby and Rosemary Clooney provide great musical numbers. Paramount was never known for great musicals, but this one is truly outstanding.",1416355200,4,943,4.820987654320987

3800213,5,B001UHOWX8,"One of the best movies that I have ever watched, I have always loved this movie and think I always will. Not just because it starred men like Bing Crosby and Danny Caine. But because the plot, the acting and everything were outstanding. Although a bit heavy on the military gung ho theme, it held up several conducts which are respected in most civil societies. And I would venture to say that even today most would think that such respect for those who served in the military is well deserved. While most would probably not take it this far, it nonetheless, has within itself something that sparked a truly amazing response from me. And I have never had the honor of serving in the military of my nation.",1408838400,,705,4.515625

The first dance scene between Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen is fantastic.  I love the song Bing croons to Rosemary Clooney over sandwiches in the Inn's lovely kitchen.

3800283,3,B001UHOWX8,"For a holiday film, White Christmas lacks the magic, miracle and wonder of It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. If this is a Christmas film then the Christmas season should have been more front and center. Instead the holiday season is just a sideline to support the duo story of Kaye and Crosby helping a struggling ski lodge owned by their former commanding officer in the war and the budding romance both Kaye and Crosby's characters have with the two ladies that brought them to the Vermont lodge in the first place. There's nothing really Christmas about this story at all other than it just happened to fall during the holidays which equals the character singing some Christmas tunes. In fact this would make a better Valentine's Day story than a Christmas story.

Bing Crosby sings better than ever but his age is well past the character he is depicting with one of the worst make-up jobs to make him look younger. When the picture was shooting between September and November 1953 Bing was 50 years old. Danny Kaye was the perfect age of 40 so he fits just fine.",1393027200,,1082,4.606217616580311

I want to go back to that era & STAY THERE!!! The cast is spectacular with talent overload.  The musical score is classic, written by Irving Berlin, the performances are impeccable. Danny Kaye is one talented dude, as well as the great Binger & Rosemary Clooney. The little known Vera- Ellen is one of the greatest female show dancers I have ever seen. All in all, even if you're not crazy about musicals this one you will love. One of finale skits ""I Wish I Was Back In the Army "" is a showstopper as well as the gorgeous finale classic "" White Christmas"". A WINNER !",1388361600,,706,4.30827067669173

One would think that with such a quintessential classic they would have done a restore on par with the Wizard of Oz.  It's not horrible, by any stretch of the imagination, just not as crisp and detailed as it could be.  Punching up the colour is really not enough.  The costumes alone demand more.  Other than that, you gotta love it!!!",1388361600,2,511,4.440860215053763

The musical numbers are perfect examples of choreography in the 50's....Vera Ellen doing tap....Danny Kaye doing ballroom....Rosemary Clooney at the height of her talents..watch for George Chakiris as a chorus boy in her Carousel club number....  When the snow starts falling at the end, it's just the perfect Christmas tableau. It takes me back to my childhood Christmases.  The Irving Berlin score is wonderful and there's a happy ending.

3800450,5,B001UHOWX8,"This is one of the kind of movies that are not being made any more - not even by Disney who used to specialize in ""feel good at the end"" movies.
This film is bright all the way through - you can see everything on the screen -- no distorted monsters and no dark places with invisible contents in the corners.
It is an especially great ""people"" movie and the folks are people with whom you can immediately identify. And they are played by excellent and well known (at least at the time the film was made) actors.
You don't have to be into ""Musicals"" to love the whole picture all the way through.
And it is not going to offend anyone by being a setarian show - it has the spirit of the season all through it.  Yes Irving Berlin called it ""Christmas"", so forget that - it is not a religious movie.
It's about American music, American people, Family values and American places, in a time when this was an American country.
You don't just feel good at the end - you will enjoy it all the way through.",1388016000,,995,4.209424083769633

3800460,1,B001UHOWX8,"This review is for the Amazon Prime version of White Christmas.

Near Christmas of 2013, I ordered the Blu-Ray of White Christmas to watch on Christmas Eve.  Unfortunately United Parcel Service (UPS) found that they had underestimated the demand for Christmas gifts and the Blu-Ray sat on their truck for Christmas.

Instead Amazon ""gave"" us an Amazon streaming version of White Christmas.  The problem with the streaming version is that the bitrate is only 2.5mbps as opposed to the 15+ mbps version on Blu-Ray.  What that means is that while both videos have 1080 lines, the Amazon prime doesn't have the moving detail that the Blu-Ray has.  In other words it's like there is a dirty window in front of the image with the Amazon streaming version.

The odds are good that if you are watching on a small screen or are far away with a medium sized screen, you won't notice.  Anyone else, there is a BIG difference in picture quality between the Amazon streaming version and the Blu-Ray version.  The Amazon streaming version has even worse quality than the worst HD cable channel I've ever seen.

So, if picture quality means anything to you, stay away from the Amazon streaming version and purchase the Blu-Ray disc.  We'll be watching the Blu-Ray this Christmas and will never (ever) look at the Amazon streaming version again.",1387929600,2,1329,4.836283185840708

I've watched it probably 30 or 40 times over the years, and never seem to grow tired of it.  I finally decided to buy the video to add to my collection of Christmas movies.

3800491,5,B001UHOWX8,"Purchased White Christmas, It's a Wonderful Life, and Miracle on 34th Street all in Blu-Ray as a bundle. These older films really come to life in Blu-Ray, White Christmas is wonderful, It's a Wonderful Life included the colorized version and it is also really good. Miracle on 34th Street only available in black and white and perhaps the difference not as noticeable. Also note that the audio is enhanced on Blu-Ray and White Christmas reflects this quite well. Experience here is that recent movies are pretty darn good on just a decent DVD player and you may not need to spend the extra money for Blu-Ray, but it can really make a difference on many of the old movies.",1387497600,,671,4.647058823529412

3800559,4,B001UHOWX8,"Originally intended as another vehicle for Fred Astaire and Crosby, as soon as Astaire read the script he declined the offer and asked to be released from his contract with Paramount.  Donald O'Connor was signed to replace Astaire but an illness caused him to drop out.  In stepped Danny Kaye, who demanded a salary of $200,000 and 10 percent of the gross (and he received it).  Vera-Ellen, seven years older than Rosemary Clooney, played her younger sister and had all her song vocals dubbed by Trudy Stevens, except for the song Sisters, where Rosemary Clooney sang both parts!

The story is pretty basic.  After the war, an established Broadway entertainer, Bob Wallace (Bing), is saddled with an overly ambitious would-be entertainer, Phil Davis (Kaye).  Wallace is unwillingly dragged into a partnership by endless guilt readily supplied by Davis.  Wallace soon rues the day he joined forces with this conniving manipulative stinker who tries to micromanage every aspect of Wallace's life, including the women he keeps throwing his way.  Enter the sister act and the introduction of a conventional movie romance times two.  As in, boy (Crosby) pursues girl (Clooney), boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy eventually gets her back (but was the effort really worth it when he learns along the way just how nasty she can be?).

This film is helped immeasurably by the addition of Mary Wickes and Dean Jagger.  The songs are great (especially my favorite, Snow).  Making this a must see every Christmas.",1386806400,,1502,5.012096774193548

3800591,5,B001UHOWX8,"One of Irving Berlin's ""recycled"" scores, in which he includes a lot of his own songs of ""yore"" (and a few new ones).  Berlin provided the plot outline for this one; said plot is a fairly idiotic one in the manner of most 1950s musicals (yeah, I know ski lodges suffer when there's no snow, but NO GUESTS AT ALL???)  The magic is in the casting, partly accidental:  Donald O'Connor was supposed to play the part that eventually went to Danny Kaye, but the chemistry between Crosby and Kaye is just TOO good.  Rosemary Clooney, in what was nearly her only movie appearance, gives a glamorous, moody performance, and Vera-Ellen is charming (her problems with anorexia--notice the high collars on many of her outfits, to conceal scarring--meant she didn't do some of the dancing numbers she was supposed to). And Robert Alton's choreography simply explodes off the screen.

White Christmas is a treasure trove of Irving Berlins most memorable songs, among them Count our Blessings Instead of Sheep, Sisters, Mandy and the beloved holiday song, White Christmas. This Diamond Anniversary Edition Combo Pack includes the Blu-ray and DVD versions of this timeless musical, plus new special features and as an amazing added Bonus, you get to own the exclusive 12 track song Christmas Music Compact Disc.

Two talented song-and-dance men Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye team up after the war to become one of the hottest acts in show business. One winter they join forces with a sister act Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen and trek to Vermont for a white Christmas. Of course, theres the requisite fun for the ladies, but the real adventure starts when Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye discover that the inn is run by their old army general, who is now in financial trouble. And the result is the stuff that dreams are made of!

FILM FACT: All songs were written by Irving Berlin. The centrepiece of the film is the title song, first used in Holiday Inn, which won that film an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1942. In addition, Count Your Blessings earned the picture its own Oscar nomination in the same category. The song ""Snow"" was originally written for Call Me Madam with the title ""Free"" was dropped in out-of-town try-outs. The melody and some of the words were kept, but the lyrics were changed to be more appropriate for a Christmas film.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Most composers would consider themselves lucky, well okay, blessed to have one film built around a song they wrote, but Irving Berlin's White Christmas which became such a popular holiday standard, it spawned two film musicals with yuletide themes. The first, 'Holiday Inn' [1942] marked the introduction of Irving Berlin's soon-to-be iconic tune by the quintessential crooner, Bing Crosby, who put such an indelible stamp on the song it would forever after be associated with him. Twelve years and millions of record sales later, Paramount went back to the Irving Berlin, and approached the prolific songwriter about mounting another Christmas musical. This time, 'White Christmas' wouldn't be just a part of the score, it would be the films title, and Bing Crosby would be back to star and sing once more. The result proved just as irresistible as 'Holiday Inn,' and in the intervening 60 years, 'White Christmas' has become an equally beloved and revered classic and this warm and sprightly film should have an annual viewing in every home each December.

I love and adore 'White Christmas' and I never tire of watching it, which is well matched up against such as other immortal Hollywood musicals as 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'Meet Me in St. Louis,' 'An American in Paris,' and 'GIGI,' it pales in comparison, but still has a magical glow about it. Director Michael Curtiz did a great job with 'Casablanca,' but he's no Vincente Minnelli, a schmaltzy script that tries to emulate Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and with the exception of the title song and a few others. 'White Christmas' remains very happy go lucky typical genre entry, but the enthusiasm and talent of its first-rate cast and intoxicating seasonal alluring songs, that definitely makes it a must watch around the Christmas festive season.

Much like the Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland let's-put-on-a-show backyard musicals it so closely resembles, as well as Judy Garland's 1950 vehicle 'Summer Stock.' 'White Christmas' tells a showbiz story sprinkled with romance and a big helping of schmaltz and Christmas is merely a backdrop and plays a very minor role in the proceedings. After aspiring song-and-dance man Phil Davis [Danny Kaye] saves the life of headliner Bob Wallace [Bing Crosby] during a Nazi strike in World War II, the two men team up and form a highly successful nightclub act. Their tour brings them to Florida, where they encounter the two sisters Judy and Betty Haynes [Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney], aspiring entertainers, and Judy and Betty slyly wangle their way into Bob and Phil's good graces, and the quartet heads up to Vermont for the sisters' holiday gig at a country inn, which they soon learn is run by Phil and Bob's former army commander, General Waverly [Dean Jagger]. Lack of snow and balmy temperatures threaten to close the struggling hotel and bankrupt the general, but Phil and Bob hatch a scheme to revive business and restore their respected leader's decaying sense of self-esteem. Yet pulling off the plan without upsetting the general's pride and their own burgeoning romances with the Haynes sisters proves to be quite a challenge.

This classic film is light and airy, with plenty of comic situations and big-time production numbers, 'White Christmas' dazzles and entertains, and for the most part, it succeeds greatly. Even Irving Berlin tunes outshine some of his colleagues' finest work, and Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney give each their all. The charming Sisters is performed straight by Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, and then given a hysterical drag twist with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye. (Watch as Bing totally cracks up as a result of Danny's over-the-top prancing and swishing and definitely one of the film's high points.) Ballads such as Count Your Blessings and the torchy Love, Look What You've Done to Me are given solid readings by Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, and Danny Kaye clowns to perfection in the avant-garde Choreography and lilting It Happens While You're Dancing and his non-musical shtick is first-rate, too, especially with Vera-Ellen, and Danny Kaye is one of Hollywood's most accomplished dancers, taps and twirls her way through a host of demanding routines, while providing some acerbic line readings that perk up the mundane screenplay.

Rosemary Clooney is known primarily as a singer and remains one of the premier interpreters of American popular songs, but she makes a fine dramatic impression here. Though her character is a bit too goody-two-shoes, Rosemary Clooney remains believable throughout and creates a comfortable chemistry with a ba-ba-ba-boom Bing Crosby that helps sustain the film between songs. Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen supply the comic relief, and their wisecracking provides a nice contrast to the gooey eyed cooing and sullen bickering of their co-stars. The priceless Mary Wickes is also on hand as the busybody housekeeper, and her impeccable timing and dry comebacks add welcome zing to each scene in which she appears.

'White Christmas,' however, is all about Bing Crosby, and in one of his last romantic roles, the crooning Bing Crosby seems to be having a ball. Though clearly reaching the upper limits in the leading man age bracket, he relies on charm, sophistication, and his velvet-toned voice to see him through, and the result is a wholly satisfying performance, which begins and ends with his signature reading of Irvin Berlin's holiday classic. The final five minutes of this cheery, heart-warming musical will surely have you and yours dreaming of a white Christmas, too, and no doubt inspire repeat viewings in the yuletide seasons to come.

Paramount Pictures chose White Christmas to be its first film to be produced in VistaVision, the studio's widescreen answer to CinemaScope. The New York Time noted the technical achievement in its review: ""The colours on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring or very little."" White Christmas was Michael Curtiz's first directing gig at Paramount Pictures after he left Warner Bros. His Paramount Pictures contract allowed him the freedom to direct films for other studios as well, and he thus floated around town from then on.

Blu-ray Video Quality  I always thought 'White Christmas' looked pretty darn good even on the inferior NTSC DVD, but this Blu-ray blows that relic right out of the water, at last making this musical appear as vibrant and stunning as it surely did upon its initial release in 1954. The improvements are immediately noticeable, beginning with the VistaVision logo and opening credits. Clarity, contrast, and especially colour saturation are supreme. Delectably bold reds and deep, lush greens truly pop off the screen, yet never look garish. A few white marks dot the print, but the number of imperfections sullying the image has been drastically reduced from what afflicted the previous inferior DVD. The standard definition version looks dull, flat, and washed out compared to this glistening 1080p image transfer, which truly does the Technicolor photography proud. Varying shades of blue and yellow and the entire pastel palette are all perfectly timed and balanced so the picture always looks smooth and cohesive. Even the drab army scenes early in the film exude a faint sparkle they've hitherto lacked, and accents, like Bing Crosby's yellow socks or Rosemary Clooney's painted nails and lips, nab our attention without overwhelming the entire image. Fine details are also much easier to discern. On the inferior NTSC DVD, the background items often appeared fuzzy and slightly unstable, but the Blu-ray crystallises even the smallest objects so we feel much more immersed in the atmosphere. Textures, such as suede, wool, leather, and satin, are very strong, and close-ups, especially those of Clooney, nicely reconcile sharpness with the cinematography's inherent warmth. Black levels are pitch-perfect throughout and just look at the inky hue of Rosemary Clooney's gown during Love, Look What You've Done to Me and the jackets of Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby during the minstrel number and the bright whites resist blooming. The natural grain structure on the Blu-ray remains intact, providing the desired feel of celluloid. Grain intensifies a bit in the background, and at times, various elements can look a little soft, but such minor annoyances rarely drag down the film's enjoyment factor. Noise reduction, edge enhancement, and banding are all blissfully absent, making this transfer a pleasure to watch from start to finish. Once again, this high-definition effort from Paramount Pictures is a huge step up from the previous inferior old fashioned NTSC DVD and well worth the extra investment.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Both the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and the Restored Mono DTS-HD Master Audio are included on this Blu-ray disc. The track trumps the inferior NTSC DVD's 5.1 Dolby Digital audio, but doesn't provide any real wrap-around sensation. The sound is still largely front-based, and minimal stereo separation never widens the field enough to make an impression. Dynamic range is solid, with both highs and lows enjoying fine presence and clarity. Bass tones shine whenever Bing Crosby sings; when his dulcet baritone slides into the lower register, we're treated to full, resonant bass shadings that add immeasurable nuance and weight to his performances. Just the familiar phrase ""I'm dreaming of a white Christmas"" proves why Bing Crosby wrote the book on crooning, and the audio here serves his marvellous instrument well. Rosemary Clooney's voice also sounds warm and velvety, and good fidelity distinguishes the instrumentals. Dialogue is always clear and comprehendible, and sonic accents like Vera-Ellen's taps and the slamming of doors are crisp and distinct. Unfortunately, some surface noise remains audible during the quieter scenes, and during Rosemary Clooney's Love, Look What You've Done to Me some static-laced pops disrupt the torchy song. Such interference continues to rear its ugly head during subsequent musical numbers, marring enjoyment somewhat. Still, this is a good quality track that honours the Irving Berlin tunes that help lend 'White Christmas' to its classic status.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Rosemary Clooney: This commentary by the late, great Rosemary Clooney may not rank high on anyone's list of stellar efforts, but it's wonderful to hear the recollections of this accomplished singer, which are all presented in a delightfully honest, matter-of-fact manner. The large gaps in the beginning are off-putting, to say the least, as Rosemary Clooney merely chuckles at the action on screen, but as the film progresses, she opens up a bit more, praising Irving Berlin, discussing a typical shooting day, and exulting Bing Crosby's style and impeccable preparedness. There's not a whole lot of substance here, and the gaps do continue throughout, but fans of the film will still enjoy watching the film with Rosemary Clooney, who comes off more as an enthusiastic aunt or grandmother than a high-falutin film star.

Special Feature: NEW! White Christmas Sing-Along Lyrics: This Blu-ray exclusive, is the 'White Christmas' Sing-Along, which can be accessed two ways. Viewers can either choose to have the song lyrics pop up automatically for all 13 tunes as they watch the entire movie, or they can select each number individually from a menu.

A number of film historians weigh in on these topics, and we're also treated to George Chakiris' own personal perspective, but sadly time has not been good to George Chakiris, as I was shocked by how he has aged.

Chaplin [President of The Roger and Hammerstein Organization]; Walter Bobbie [Director of White Christmas: The Stage Musical] and Bruce Pomahac [Director of Music at The Roger and Hammerstein Organization] who talk extensively about how they brought all of their artistic team together, to bring the classic film to fruition. We also get to hear about the stage adaptation and transforming the classic film musical into a Broadway successful show and the changes necessary to make it work.

Special Feature Documentary: White Christmas: A Look Back with Rosemary Clooney [480i] [17:00] A holdover from the previous DVD release, this standard making-of documentary showcases Rosemary Clooney's memories, which run the gamut from casting and her relationship with Vera-Ellen to the chemistry between Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby and talks about the impromptu on-set visit by the King and Queen of Greece [which you see a short film clip], but Bing Crosby was absent, as he decided that playing golf was more important.

Finally, 'White Christmas' is one of Hollywood's most beloved holiday classics, and its arrival on this re-mastered Blu-ray is such good news indeed, especially as it a far superior to the previous Blu-ray release. Though the story may be trite, the talent and enthusiasm of the accomplished cast keeps this musical fresh and lively throughout repeated viewings. With a lush video transfer, solid audio (despite a few glitches) and a healthy spate of new extra supplements, so making this one Blu-ray disc that will brighten even Ebenezer Scrooge's day. It's also a huge step up from the previous inferior NTSC DVD release, and is well worth owning on Blu-ray. Because of all this, that is why I was so keen to own this classic festive film, especially as it has now been re-mastered on this Diamond Anniversary Edition, as it cannot be beaten and is also a timeless classic, as you get a warm glow viewing this amazing Blu-ray disc and that is why it is a great honour to have this included in my Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

3800662,4,B001UHOWX8,"Forget the so-called entertainment stars of today and their barely audible mumblings of popular vulgarities and screamings of meaningless musical sounds in useless reality movies produced and directed by money motivated drama school dropouts. Entertain us. Take us away from reality for an hour or so with corny, unlikely plots such as with White Christmas. So the singers are all dead--- So what? The vibrations from their songs are captured on tape and still haunt us; and what living child of the Great Depression doesn't associate Irving Berlin's classic title song for this Video with Bing Crosby's once popular version of it? The story is benign and corny, but the product is more than worth the money.",1371254400,,708,5.05982905982906

We have most of it memorized, and no shortage of Mistie comments each time. After the intro, which is WW2 and some tiny fragments over the next 5 years, the whole story takes place in about 4 weeks, from when the boys meet the girls to Christmas Eve.",1366934400,,384,4.422535211267606
3800677,5,B001UHOWX8,"Many years ago, the first video tape I ever bought was of this movie. I'd play it every Christmas, but with time it became worn and hard to watch. And, of course, it wasn't sharp, with poor color. So, finally replaced it with this, the color and sharp picture make this classic much more enjoyable.",1366675200,,298,4.4363636363636365
3800678,1,B001UHOWX8,"I first watched this movie YEARS ago on television and didn't understand it.  I think I was 10.  Well, 40 years have past since then and I still don't get the supposed ""charm"" of this film.  For starters, Crosby and Kaye are too old for their roles.  Like way too old.  Then you have to get past Rosemary Clooney's way-to-happy-to-be-here face/personae.  Add to that, sorry Clooney fans, she just can't sing.  I have always wanted to slap the face of the first person that ever told her that she could.  Ah.  Vera-Ellen.  Cutesy-cutesy and yes, she can dance (some) but her smile just gets in the way.

These four ""kids"" have the idea to go to Vermont to help out the old General of Crosby and Kaye from the war.  The General has an inn.  The ""kids"" have an idea.  (Oh, it's a little patriotic, too).  I find it stomach-turning to see/hear ""the kids"" on the train all excited about snow.  It's a song.  ""Snow"".  Rosemary Clooney wants to wash her face and hair in it.  No kidding.  Those are the lyrics.  This makes Clooney, right out of the gate, an idiot.  Who the hell wants to wash themselves in freaking snow?????  And Clooney is old enough to know better.

For a ""Christmas"" musical, there is woefully little holiday cheer here.

The General's former troops come to the inn, (thanks to ""the kids""; the troops obviously had nothing else to do on Christmas Eve) and the film goes dark and long and funeral-like.  Ghastly.  It's a long, long scene and one that the film should have done without.  Everyone rallies for the General.  Whomever he was/is.

What little comedy there is is supplied by Mary Wickes.  Well, thank God for that.  The plot twists don't even twist as movie fans have seen this sort of thing a thousand times before.  And better.

At the pinnacle of ""the big show"" that ""the kids"" have put on for the troops, everyone is singing ""White Christmas"", the barn door opens and it is snowing, and Rosemary Clooney gives Bing Crosby the gift of

a glass horse.

This is NOT a Christmas movie.  This is just plain 2 hours wasted out of your life.",1366588800,7,2062,4.475675675675675

The sound quality on the songs (and there are a lot of them in the movie) is also excellent. There are MANY favorite musical moments in this movie, but the one I like best is the one where Rosemary Clooney sings ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" in a supper club. She looks beautiful, and note that one the male dancers who accompany her in this song is the very handsome George Chakiris, who later went on to play Shark's leader Bernardo in the movie ""West Side Story.""",1360886400,,635,4.170731707317073

When their friends come over & watch classics like these & White Christmas, they too, laugh uproariously at them.  Then they sit back & wonder why shows today aren't funny!  The grace of Vera Ellen & Danny Kaye, & the beauty of Rosemary Clooney's voice, the innocence that life can be if we remain focused on others instead of ourselves--all of this comes through in WC.

It seems like all you can do is watch it again from Amazon.",1358812800,,347,4.292307692307692

3800755,5,B001UHOWX8,Many say It's a Wonderful Life is the movie to watch at Christmas. It has Jimmy Stewart so that's a plus. In addition there is a great cast with him. For my money it's this movie. Listening to Bing sing the title song takes me back to when I was a kid when life was simpler. The rest of the cast is very good and the musical numbers top notch. My father was a World War II veteran and this was one of his favorites. Maybe watching it reminds me of him. I know I feel better after watching it. 'Nuf said.,1358553600,,503,3.9411764705882355

This isn't just a Christmas musical but also a romantic comedy. The chemistry between these actors are genuine. And I agree with my 83 year old father about how this is what movies aught to be like. Movies to help make you smile and laugh, the ability to enjoy as a family and one that can become a family tradition to watch.

The color on this copy is out of alignment, resulting in a double film image (a separation between color and black-and-white). Bing's ""baby blues"" are lower than were they're supposed to be and hairlines (especially in the beginning when the men are in uniform) have a large color gap where you can see black and white (almost as if this were a colorized black and white film). I also had some trouble with the audio sync. I may have a bad copy, given all the good reviews but clearly this DVD is unwatchable! Big disappointment.

Amazon Streaming - Watching using the browser on a 23in monitor/tv was fine, but on anything larger it would appear pixelated and grainy. It would be nice if the browser viewer could get an upgrade and be able to stream HD movies.

Overall - The warmth and charm of the movie made up for any audio/video quality issues. I highly recommend finding some loved ones and sitting down to watch this charming Christmas classic.",1355875200,,528,4.666666666666667

It's an all star cast with star rated singers and dancers.  This dvd is nice and the extras are fun.

This isn't just a Christmas musical but also a romantic comedy.  The chemistry between these actors are genuine.  And I agree with my 83 year old grandfather about how this is what movies aught to be like.  Movies to help make you smile and laugh, the ability to enjoy as a family and one that can become a family tradition to watch.

3800913,5,B001UHOWX8,"I first saw White Christmas on NBC's ""Saturday Night At The Movies"" in December, 1964 (wow) and have gone through a few phases with it since.  As a boy I liked it; as a teenager I thought it was hopelessly sappy and disappointing because, aside from the big finale, it seemed to have little to do with Christmas.  Now, as an adult, it's an absolute must-see every Christmas season.  I've come to realize that the key is to appreciate it for what it is: a big, expensive, expertly-crafted mid-1950's Hollywood musical, intended to be fun, lightweight entertainment (although the story it tells is very much in keeping with the Christmas spirit).  I love it because, however contrived, it lets us spend a couple of hours in a world now more than half a century in the past that, considering the negative, vile material which is now presented as entertainment, is a very nice place to hang out for a little while.  Enjoy the great dancing and singing, the dialog (which is wittier than most people think), and the spirit of caring that it ultimately stands for.

As to the quality of the video itself, until now White Christmas never received the restoration it deserved.  The VHS version was not good - dark and grainy.  The DVD version was a lot better, but the medium brought attention to other flaws such as the wavering brightness of the first ten or 15 minutes of the film. It appears as though the Blu-ray release has finally addressed those flaws.  I recently happened upon a store showing this on a 75"" HD display and I was impressed with the video quality.  The sound is ok, better than earlier remastered versions I've heard, but this may be the best it can get.  For some reason motion picture sound recording lagged way behind picture quality for many years, but I digress.  Enjoy!",1355529600,,1791,4.632911392405063

I bought the DVD of it a few years ago and it is now one my favorite annual movies to watch around Christmas. The songs are wonderful and the cast has great chemistry, especially during the musical numbers at the ending.

Trivia: Vera-Ellen, who played Judy Haynes, did all her own dancing scenes, but she couldn't sing. All her singing numbers were dubbed by somebody else.",1355270400,4,502,4.456521739130435
3800939,1,B001UHOWX8,"I really have no idea how people consider this a ""holiday classic"".  The photo on the cover is the best part of the movie. Really.

 Hard to follow storyline, I forgot it was a Christmas movie at all.  It is mostly about glorifying the Army and war.  I heard it was based on ""Holiday Inn"", a MUCH better movie and musical.  I wouldn't waste my time on White Christmas.

Idk if it was originally in BnW-the version I watched was ""update"" in color--but still was awfully dark and kinda depressing.  There was no  chemistry between the males and females, as there was in Holiday Inn, and most of the singing and dancing was solos done by one woman (and wasn't entertaining in the slightest), while Crosby and partner barely got screen time! What a waste!

I can't help but wonder if there are fake reviews on this movie just to keep the rating high..for some reason.",1355270400,4,863,4.4743589743589745

3800955,5,B001UHOWX8,"A bona fide hit musical that dazzles many decades after it first premiered. Starring none other than legendary Bing Crosby, comedian Danny Kaye, singer Rosemary Clooney, and exciting dancer actress Vera Ellen. Two successful stage stars get hooked up with a sister act and find themselves involved with an old army general who's retired and stuck with a white elephant of a failing ski resort. They conjure a plan to infuse new life into the resort by staging a commemorative brilliant show to build esteem not just into the resort, but the retired general himself who's not all together happy being retired at what he was good at. Many tuneful numbers and stage acts with the wonderful Vera Ellen doing some stunning dancing that just beef up the star power behind her with lovely holiday standard vocals, and dance acts of their own. Colorful, and memorable.",1355011200,6,860,4.897260273972603

Really shows a different time of movies where it was relied on CGI or special effects. Where the actors and actress' really had talent a movie was an actual show. Not just sex and violence.

3800994,5,B001UHOWX8,"This must surely be the archetypal Christmas movie (Paramount, 1954)! It starred Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye (who was brought in to replace an injured Donald O'Connor). Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney play a pair of singing sisters whose charm entices entertainers Crosby and Kaye to journey to Vermont for the winter snow. In Vermont they stay at an inn run by an old army buddy, played by Dean Jagger, and with Mary Wickes as the long-suffering housekeeper. You may remember her playing the same role in Doris Day movies a couple of years earlier. The inn is in financial trouble because of a lack of winter snow (global warming even then!) so Crosby and Kaye bring the cast of their New York show to Vermont to put the show on there and - the snow falls right on cue as the show opens. Robert Alton choreographed the two big ensemble numbers.
The film score was by Irving Berlin with a host of fine tunes: a reprise for `White Christmas' (first heard in Holiday Inn, Paramount, 1942); `The best things happen while you're dancing' (Kaye and Vera-Ellen); `Sisters' (well, you know who, and reprised by Crosby and Kaye in drag), `Count your blessings', `Love, you didn't do right by me', `Snow', `Heat wave', and others. Though the plot was hardly gripping, this was a thoroughly enjoyable family film that deserves its many repeats on television.

3801007,5,B001UHOWX8,White Christmas is my favorite Christmas song whether it be by Bing Crosby or Rosemary Clooney or whoever. Its a good song. And this is a good movie. You wouldnt think of Christmas while watching it though. They talk about the holiday but its only at the begining and the end mostly the end that we show any signs that Christmas is near. Its a musical and except for a song called Snow White Christmas is the only Christmas song in the whole movie. Still as I said its a good movie. Merry Christmas,1335225600,,498,4.308510638297872

When I saw that this was on blu-ray I wasn't expecting the quality to be that much different than the DVD of it, boy was I wrong! When I watched it in blu-ray it was as if I had never seen it before due to the studio restoring its colors & clarity! The colors were beautiful and you can see how truly detailed their outfits and make up are. It makes you feel like you're in the movie back in 1955, the quality of the newly restored picture is unbelievable. For those of you who have never seen White Christmas, this movie has it all, singing (of course since its 2 stars are Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney), dancing & comedy by Danny Kay & Vera Ellen, and a bunch of beautiful stage performances all mixed in with the Christmas feeling.

3801025,5,B001UHOWX8,"First let me say this, there are two conflicts in this movie technically. The first is between, Danny Kayes character. And Bing Crosby's character, in the Army, Phil Davis-Danny Kaye. Had saved the life of his captain Bob Wallace- Bing Crosby, after the war they become a famous song and Dance team. Helped along by the manipulation of Phil, who everytime Bob doesn't want to do a show, phil points to his arm. And Bob gives in and does the show, the second is between Bob and one of the sisters. Who gets second hand information from the house keeper, who doesn't even get all the information herself. And yes, it lasts longer than ten minutes. She walks out of rehearsels, treats him like crap at the Big Christmas party, where Judy and Phil announce their fake engagement, so Bob and the other sister will hook up. She eventually leaves vermont, and heads to new york. Meanwhile Bob has to go to New York, to go on the Ed Harris show. To plug the show they're doing in Vermont, while there. He goes into a night club, where the other sister is now a performer. He tries to talk to her, and tell her that Phil and Judy's engagement was fake. She kind of dismisses him, and it's only after she's watching the Ed Harris she realizes how wrong she was, this conflict isn't really even fully resolved. Until she shows up at the end in the big christmas show they're doing. And this lasts a good 20 minutes to almost thirty minutes of the movie, it's a good christmas movie. Fred Astaire was supposed to be in it, much like he was in ""Holiday Inn"", him and Bing Crosby were going to make a kind of trio of christmas movies. Fred got sick, and they landed Danny Kaye, this movie should be in your collection. Yes there's singing, but this movie is smart. Doesn't really drag, I highly recommend it.",1327622400,,1794,4.422960725075528

3801069,4,B001UHOWX8,"It should be noted right off the bat - I don't like musicals.  White Christmas however, is one of the few exceptions.  Typically, I think it's absurb how normal people break into song in the middle of conversations.  In White Christmas though, it makes sense.  Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye are two World War II vets that become a singing and dancing duo after the war.  Their performances, and the performances of the members of the show, make up the bulk of the musical numbers.

A yearly standard for my wife's family at Christmas, I saw White Christmas for the first time a few years ago. I must admit to being surprised by my interest in the story and characters.  Kaye is determined to marry Crosby off, in the hopes that a married Crosby will be less of a workaholic.  Kaye identifies Rose Mary Clooney's character, Betty, as a possible love interst.  Only problem - other than Crosby's resistence - is Clooney is the older sister in a sister act and she is determined to play mother hen to her baby chick, to paraphrase Kaye.

Everyone ends up at a job in Vermont at Inn owned by Crosby's and Kaye's former WWII General, General Waverly.  Sadly, the Inn is doing poorly (partially due to a lack of snow at a snow resort at Christmas time) so the team decides to spark interest in the resort by staging their Broadway show at the Inn.

If you are a fan of musicals, the singing and dancing are classically brilliant for the most part - or so my wife tells me. For me, the story can be a bit contrived at times, it's the performances and dialogue that really shine.  Note Crosby calling Kaye a ""Weirdsmobile"" at one point for all his scheming.  For a film originally released in 1954, it looks and sound great on Blu Ray.  I bought this for my wife for christmas this year after hearing that many of these older films look and sound amazing on Blu Ray.  I have to say I agree.  I'd say that I'm now interested in purchasing more older films like this to add to my collection of modern films.

There are a good number of special features on this Disc.  First off, a commentary track with Rose Mary Clooney.  It seems a bit akward at times.  I think it would have been better if perhaps they had someone knowledgable of the film sit with her and discuss parts of the film with her.  She is quiet for a good part of the commentary and only has a handful of interesting stories to tell.  In fact, she makes a point in talking about story flaws in the film on several occasions, which seems odd.  There are featurettes on three of the four leads of the film (no Vera Ellen for some reason).

One issue I have with this Blu Ray, is it tends to be priced high.  I picked up a copy before Thanksgiving when it was $16.99.  It's usually $24.99.  I recommend waiting until after Christmas and perhaps you can find it for less than $20.",1324771200,3,2828,4.345419847328245

3801073,3,B001UHOWX8,"We just finished watching this movie and my wife and I absolutely love this movie. But we were greatly disappointed in Paramount's ""faux"" restoration of this classic. In Paramount's rush to make the anniversary deadline, they went with the cheapest quickest restoration. My wife and I had watched the Breakfast At Tiffany's blu ray disc (which is also Paramount) and that terrific was a restoration job. There was no film dirt or scratches to be found. It looked absolutely beautiful! With White Christmas, there was still plenty of film dirt and flicker (this is when the brightness dims constantly). Although the colors looked better than the standard DVD there was still room for improvement. I wish Paramount would have gone the way of the Breakfast At Tiffany's restoration. My wife and I still love White Christmas just as much as we did but we're terribly dissatisfied with Paramount's restoration.

3801075,3,B001UHOWX8,"Vera made the show for me... what a talent, never heard of her before or after but then again I am too young for her era... Bing looked waaay tooo old for Rosemary and his makeup waxed n waned to ill effects but yes his voice is priceless... My only issue was the end scene with the snowfall in the background and all the performers just act like it is comfortable with 32degree weather behind them... the SNOW song on the train etc is poorly written but Irving is such an incredible talent I forgive him for such trivial notions... Danny Kaye is adorable in this role and seemed to be overshadowed by Bing, no FAIR!!  Oh well, heartwarming tale of WWII pals and connections available like the mafia... you just show up based on a letter/TV cattle call!!  Reminder of all the men who served bravely and assimilating with great unease in the aftermath, wonder if the Iraqi vets will experience same... Overall great entertainment for 1954 especially Vera!!",1323907200,,955,4.6117647058823525

The color pops beyond my expectations and the detail in closer shots is amazing.  Beard stubble on soldiers, fur on clothing, designs on clothing, and Bing's eyes never looked so blue before... just details.  I found myself not so much watching the move, rather just comparing this newer version with what I've been used to seeing over the years.  John Wayne's ""The Searchers"" is another one to see for the same reason.  Transfers from original Vista Vision films seems to have a lot, and I mean a lot of potential.  I've seen White Christmas for years and years most of my life and it has truly been a treat to see this classic once again for the first time!",1323907200,,789,4.4
3801077,5,B001UHOWX8,"White Christmas has been one of my favorite movies since I was a wee tyke, and after wearing out three copies on VHS, I realized that it was time to take the plunge and purchase it on dvd. It arrived in a timely manner and was well-wrapped for safe delivery. The dvd case was in pristine shape, and the dvd itself had no flaws whatsoever.

This movie is, in my opinion, THE best Christmas movie out there. It stands among the ranks of Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, and has a sense of nostalgia that simply cannot be found in movies nowadays. The vocal performances by Crosby and Clooney are unparalleled, and Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen's dance performances take the film to a whole other level. The cast is extremely talented, and film production is very well done -- especially for the time.

Since receiving the film three weeks ago, I have watched it four times already and have fallen in love with the film all over again every time I have watched it. This film is comparable to none other, and is the perfect stocking stuffer or Christmas gift for anyone who wishes for the old days when Christmas was more about the simple things.

I personally would recommend this film to anyone. Lovely story, lovely production, and the film itself is all-around the best.",1323734400,2,1283,4.545454545454546

The Dancing is wonderful and the signing even better.  I like Counting your Blessings number even better than the signature White Christmas although the finale is wonderful.  I like Mary Wickes is wonderful as the busy body housekeeper.  rosemary Clooney did a wonderful job along with Vera Allen.  There is a great short retrospect given by Rosemary Clooney.,1323648000,2,513,4.839080459770115

3801080,5,B001UHOWX8,"I saw this movie on it's original release year, and being a kid I was worried about there being too much singing and dancing.
That didn't last long, especially after one look at Vera Ellen!  Her dancing with Danny Kaye, and the spirited and dynamic musical numbers made this a startling revelation for me!
The spirit and joy of Christmas are never more present than in this very heartwarming tale.  The giving back, as if from Son to Father (in this case Officer to General -Ret.) is both the basic idea and long-lived celebration of Christendom's most joyous birth.
As a musical it is top notch.  I can't think of any musicals that can top it!  My title review of ""Christmas for The Greatest Generation"" is just that -- an appreciation of the folks of that era that gave us the joy and spirit of the Christmas Holiday without goinbg over the top.  It pays homage to the guys and gals that brought us back from the agony of war to the peace and beauty of a 1950's America expanding its chest to encompass the best of the American Dream.  If you can think of anyone better than Der Bingle and Rosemary Clooney to sing these marvelouos Irving Berlin tunes, then I must have missed them!  The Blu-Ray transfer is immaculate and makes the music even more appreciated!
I was also taken with the splendid performance of Dean Jagger as the retired General whose Vermont Inn is in the doldrums.  Upon reflection, he reminds me of the Captain of the first ship I was on in the Navy some XX years ago!  A very real person; a touching human being.  He may have been the antithesis of Omar Bradley, whom the soldiers referred to as the ""G.I's General"".
I am thoroughly at peace when I view this movie.  It has the heart and soul of an era, and the music that properly defines it.  Remember, this is POST-WAR America.  For those many of you who were not there, this is a nod to the folks who entertained us after the heartbreak of WWII, when many of the 'Greatest Generation' were lost.  Luckily for us, there were people back then who knew how to entertain to the fullest -- with both a simple story and glorious song and dance!  THIS IS A REAL CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!  ***** 5 STARS WERE NEVER BETTER USED!*****",1322524800,6,2195,4.43640897755611
3801081,5,B001UHOWX8,"I absolutely love this movie and always have.  Watching it again and again on this ""restored"" version make me love it even more.  Noticing continuity issues and some of the film imperfections just renew my appreciation for it as a little bit of history/art.  After all, once upon a time you just saw the movie once in the theater.  No one ever thought you'd watch it eight times the week of Christmas break so it's unlikely you'd ever notice that Rosemary Clooney's coffee cup emptied and refilled itself magically two or three times in a matter of 30 seconds!
I start tearing up in the first scene when I think of all the soldiers from every war who never made it home for Christmas and I'm crying again (happy tears!) at the end when the general tells the men what a sorry outfit they all are!  In between there are plenty of laughs and such wonderful dancing.  Oh, the dancing!  Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen are AMAZING.  I sort of tricked my nephew into watching part of the movie with me once (he saw the beginning and thought it was going to be a war movie!).  When we got to the dancing on the dock in Florida, even he was impressed--how could you not be?

3801082,5,B001UHOWX8,"Forget reviewing the movie, that's pointless, it's a classic. However, the home media versions ever since VHS have been disappointing at best. NOT ANY MORE. Finally somebody ""got it"", and spent the money on the right post-production, and got this movie scanned in and converted to full 1080p HD. The imagery is jaw-dropping, no exaggeration. Many old movies look so-so on Blu-Ray, mainly because the parties involved don;t spend the cash to do full HD scans of the film and the proper post work to enhance it all. Granted it's not cheap, but the results are amazing when they do. White Christmas is now a jaw-dropper quality-wise. LADIES: have a look at Vera Ellen's dress when her and Danny Kaye are dancing on the pier, there are details in her dress that we never saw before (and I'm a guy and usually don't notice that stuff).

3801107,5,B001UHOWX8,"Ok , sadly we get vhs, several dvd versions and now the blu  ray reviews all stuck together because of amazons well laziness in this regard. Sure I am grateful they provide customer reviews but it's torture in some aspects when you are looking for a blu ray review.  Blu rays can be so different than a standard dvd! This one is ALOT better than any previous dvd release. It has all the extras of the Anniversary Edition too! Lots of interviews. The picture mostly looks fantastic , better than it's ever looked since it was on the big screen. BUT it's not perfect some scenes go fuzzy a little and were probably never as clear as the other scenes to begin with. BUt those are rare, you do see some small white specks now and again but they are no distraction and this movie has been worked on unlike lets say 'quo vadis' which left the lines in. this has no lines! or bad damage, so it's a fantastic improvement and even if you saw it in a theater it would probably have lots more specks than the few here.  The sound is 5.1 but it still mainly comes out your center speaker , this was a mono movie after all but I do barely hear the side speakers, barely. Still that's no big deal considering how wonderful this classic movie looks, and it's a classic in so many ways, a classic musical , a classic comedy buddy team up , it's old hollywood at it's best and it's in color which is another bonus as many movies back then were in black and white and lets face it musicals and period dramas don't look as great in black and white. This isn't though and it's just a wonderful movie on blu ray. It could have been perfect but it comes close to that!",1305936000,8,1646,4.219047619047619

Danny Kaye is brilliant in anything he does, and Rosemary Clooney was charming as always, but it seemed like the entire second half of the movie was dedicated to Vera Ellen's unremarkable dancing skills. The songs were kind of boring, and the dancing sequences in the second half are only mildly less interesting than a drum solo. The story itself could have been interesting, but they chose to spend more time on the dancing and singing than the actual story, so it felt like a lot was missing in the overall feel of the movie.

3801138,4,B001UHOWX8,"White Christmas,released Oct./54,was the first to use the Vista-Vision film process. This entailed using about twice the actual film space than ordinary film and the resultant prints,it was thought,would appear more vibrant and clear. The print used here is definitely wonderful;more on that later.
The plot of White Christmas is a kind of remake of Holiday Inn(/42)with Bing and Astaire starring then. Unlike Holiday Inn though,this time around they got it right. Holiday Inn had a complicated and ponderous plot going all over the map and never in the end really satisfied. In White Christmas,even though the plot is almost see through,its' solid cast of players,its' numbers and inherent pleasant sensibility make it most entertaining to watch. Bing in Holiday Inn seemed a little on the stiff side but here he's as cool as a cucumber in mannerisms and in his delivery of his lines,in that inimitable relaxed Crosby style.
The story opens during WW2 and two entertainers Bob Wallace(Crosby)and Phil Davis(Kaye)with the Army 151st Division,are entertaining their comrades. Bob is a captain and in civilian life was a big name singer,while Phil is a Private First class who assists Bob with music and even in his act. During an air raid Phil rescues Bob from being hurt by a falling wall. While convalescing Phil asks if after the war they don't become a team. Bob balks but Phil starts using his heroic deed of saving Bob's life to persuade him to do it.(This old ""wound"" would be something Phil would use off and on throughout their relationship whenever he wanted something).
The war ends and Wallace and Davis actually become the hottest thing on the Great White Way and in the entertainment business in general. While in Florida they receive a telegram from an ex-army buddy asking if they wouldn't mind checking out the act of his sisters Betty(Rosemary Clooney)and Judy(Vera-Ellen).This they do and they are quite impressed. Judy and Phil hit it off right away but Betty isn't too impressed with Bob. In fact she reveals it was her sister that wrote the letter they received. Before the sisters can finish out the night their landlord has come with the Sheriff to collect some rent from them. Phil,unbeknownst to Bob,gives the girls their train tickets and they make their escape.
Later on the train heading to New York and beyond Bob is flabbergasted that Phil hasn't got the train tickets and that they have had to shell out $95 more to get on the train. Eventually the truth comes out and the girls thank both of them for their generosity(Bob is seething)and tell them they are heading to a place called Pine Grove,Vermont for their next gig. Phil persuades Bob to go along and they all head off for ""snowy"" Vermont.
Upon arrival there is no snow and it seems the Inn they are scheduled to play in is doing horrendous business(due to the lack of the white stuff) and they can't afford to pay them full salary. The owner walks in and it is none other than their former commanding officer Major General Waverly(Dean Jagger).He indeed confirms the lack of business but he insists to see the act and pay them in full.
Phil and Bob are heart broken for the General and his circumstances and it is decided to bring the entire cast of their Broadway show up to Vermont to perform. To get some publicity he enlists the help of a popular New York variety show host to plug it. The conversation is overheard by one of the staff who mistakenly come away thinking he is going to exploit the General by playing up the down and out angle. Of course it's horse manure but Betty gets wind of this and quits the show,returning to New York.
Bob goes on the show as scheduled and Betty watches. Realizing she was mistaken she rushes back to Vermont to rejoin the cast on Christmas Eve. It's a great reunion;the general's place is saved and Phil and Judy and Bob and Betty declare their love for each other. The film ends with the refrains of White Christmas.
This films grabs its' groove early on and sticks with it pretty much throughout the picture. The plot as I mentioned is the old boy meets girl,loses girl and gets her in the end thing,coupled with we gotta sing and dance to save the day thrown in for good measure. It's been there,done that and have the tee shirt time,but with a few twists and turns and the solid cast it comes out a winner. Also mentioned was that Bing was in fine form here both in acting and singing. His cool and relaxed demeanour really sold a good part of the film. Danny Kaye was quite a talent and he is in fine singing,dancing and acting form also. Rosemary Clooney in the best movie of her career shows off her abundant talent in both the acting and singing department. She showed alot of acting chutzpah and never let anyone get the better of her in a scene. Vera Ellen was,well,Vera Ellen. Looking positively anorexic she had enough talent to execute her dance routines well but her frequent camera looks are bothersome. For example,at one point Kaye and Ellen go into what one could easily consider,in style anyways,an Astaire/Rogers routine in the ""The best Things happen While you're Dancing"" number. Unlike Rogers who rarely if ever looked into the camera while dancing,Ellen is too frequently looking at us as if to say""Aren't I doing Well?"".It spoils this and every other routine she executes,no matter how competently she does them.
In the technical department the print used here is a very good one. There are some areas which could use a cleaning up but generally it is quite crisp and clear and the producers succeeded in giving their movie lots and lots of colours,which come through vibrantly. The film is in its' original a/r of 2:35:1. This is the two disc ""Holiday Edition"" and it comes in a two one sided disc set,in a keepcase. Housing the keepcase is a clear and silver lined plastic cover. The inside front of it sports a picture from the film of its main stars and in front of that there is a flat clear bag of plastic shavings simulating snow flakes. In addition there are eight 4""X6"" repro lobby cards enclosed. Extra features include:commentary by Clooney,backstage stories,a short on Clooneys Kentucky home,a short on Bing and Danny Kaye,a short on Irving Berlin and the music for the film,the stage production of the film,two theatrical trailers and a look back at the movie with Clooney herself.
All in all a good holiday themed movie and its' stars are in top form. Never mind the plot just go with the flow and enjoy the high production values,the production numbers,the great Berlin music,the wonderful clarity of the picture and above all the good on screen chemistry of its stars.

3801166,5,B001UHOWX8,"Each year I try and highlight a holiday classic that I think deserves more attention than it usually gets. For me the thing I notice is that the classic holiday films that I recall all had positive messages in them without making fun of people, harming people or trying to make light of the holiday. That seems to be the way things go these days.

Everything from Bad Santa's to holidays people hate to spend with family is fair game in the holiday films made these days. It kind of makes you wonder just what kind of holidays the folks in Hollywood had when they were kids. Mine were all filled with the joyous wonder of a child that believes in that magic of Santa Claus. Today's film makers all rely on the Grinch.

But occasionally the powers that be on the west coast decide to bring back the classics. Such is the case with the blu-ray release of the Bing Crosby hit WHITE CHRISTMAS. I've watched this film every year for some time now (it's my wife's favorite) and enjoyed it each time. But this new blu-ray release made me feel like I was seeing a whole new movie.

For those who've never seen the film it follows the careers of two entertainers who met up during the war, a seasoned stage vet played by Bing Crosby and a partner he picks up while in the service played by Danny Kaye. After the war they pair up and become quite successful as a duo, so much so that Kaye longs for the days when Crosby will find a woman and settle down so he'll have some time to himself.

Enter the Haines sisters, sisters of an old Army friend looking for advice. More than advice the elder of the two (played by Rosemary Clooney) catches the eye of Crosby while Kaye gets the younger one (Vera Ellen) to assist him in keeping it going. Soon the whole group heads to Vermont where the girls have a gig at a resort inn.

Low and behold the owner of the inn is the general that Crosby and Kaye served under and admired. With no snow on the ground and all the general's money tied into an inn about to go under, Crosby decided to bring the cast and crew of his show to the inn under the guise of a rehearsal. Point of fact he's hoping the appearance of the show will draw people in.

Mix up and overheard phone conversations lead to a misunderstanding in the romance department but all is solved by film's end. And along the way we're treated to some fantastic dance and musical sequences with songs by the outstanding Irving Berlin.

So what makes this movie feel so special now? Paramount has done an amazing job of revitalizing this film. The restored print looks amazing with colors that seem to pop off the screen and dazzle like never before. The classic end sequence with the title song and the four main stars decked out in red Santa outfits offer some of the brightest reds I've seen onscreen.

But more than, that this film has more heart than anything made in recent times. We're at a mid point in the history of this country. WW II gave us a war where we had clear cut heroes, a war where we were doing the right thing. Vietnam gave us an undefined war that resulted in protest and a completely different treatment of the soldiers who returned home. The soldiers depicted here in the film's opening and the respect they offer the man they served under in the film's finale show a different time and a different attitude.

Perhaps there were well deserved moments of disrespect to be aimed at career military strategists at one time, but they were few and far between and the entire group didn't need to be lumped together. And sadly it seems that happened and continues to this day. But the tide is finally turning and a newfound respect for those in the military is growing. Too bad Hollywood is more focused on the things they do wrong than the things they do right. Perhaps there's some justice though in the fact that films dealing with how bad the military is these days seem doomed at the box office.

So where does this tie in with WHITE CHRISTMAS? The story. The tale of two men affected by the war, brought together by the war and who offer up their services and admiration for a man they followed in the war. You can't help but watch the final sequence of this film and not swell with pride at the reunion of soldiers there to honor a man who commanded them in battle. But enough with the military.

The film is filled with some of the best music and dance seen on screen. Watching Kaye and Ellen glide effortlessly while the tune ""The Best Things Happened When You Dance"" or listening to Crosby sing ""Counting My Blessings"" to a Clooney as they fall in love continue to entertain to this day.

As I said earlier, while watching this new blu-ray release of the film I was stunned by the appearance. I found it breathtaking to see the colors pop, the crispness and clarity of the picture and the sound that filled the screen bringing this classic back to life.

So often we forget those wonderful movies we grew up with, those that came to life on a one night each year around Christmas. With new technology we have the opportunity to not only relive those great movie moments, we have the chance to share them with an entire new generation. And with the restored versions, like this one, we have the chance to see them as they were meant to be seen.

The new blu-ray edition of WHITE CHRISTMAS has extras but those aren't the important thing. It's the movie that is. And if you receive a blu-ray player for Christmas, this is one film that you should definitely add to your collection. You can make the viewing of WHITE CHRISTMAS an annual event in your home just as we have. And you'll find yourself singing one tune or another days after watching.",1292803200,4,5661,4.3944603629417385
3801167,5,B001UHOWX8,"I have just seen the Blu-Ray DVD of ""White Christmas"" and I am blown away. I have this film on VHS, DVD (anniversary edition) and I have seen it at the movies twice. Nothing compares to Blu-Ray. The colors and clarity will have your eyes wandering all over the scenes. It's hard to focus on the main actors as the background actors, dancers and sets all seem to pop off the screen. Of course the main action is spot on. You'll be amazed at the way the fabrics in the clothing become apparent. I must also note the soundtrack has also been scrubbed. This is the best sounding version I have heard to date. I'm talking about the restored mono track and the 5.1 surround track. The orchestrations seem fuller and richer and there is more clarity between Bing and Danny in their duets. This is the real deal.",1292803200,3,804,4.402684563758389
3801168,5,B001UHOWX8,"I first saw this film as a TV rerun as a kid, and enjoyed the post war ambiance, the costumes and the dance.  It has since become one of the 20 or so films I watch every year at Christmas time as a matter of personal tradition.

The film is typical for the time, 1950s, with wonderful costumes, especially for women.  The music is Irving Berlin classic and enhances the winter concept and the Christmas holiday especially.  The colors are intense and designers and filmographers have obviously gone to considerable effort to create eye pleasing contrasts.

Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby were wonderfully paired.  The combo of Hope and Crosby established Crosby as the straight man in a comedy duo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Road-With-Bob-Hope-and-Bing-Crosby-Collection-Road-to-Singapore-Road-to-Zanzibar-Road-to-Morocco-Road-to-Utopia/dp/B0001FGBZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Road With Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Collection (Road to Singapore/Road to Zanzibar/Road to Morocco/Road to Utopia)</a>, and Danny Kaye had a brilliant career as a funny man,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Court-Jester/dp/079215519X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Court Jester</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-General-1949/dp/B000PDZS4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector General (1949)</a>.  Their pairing seems almost inevitable.  While I could see Kaye guilting out Crosby over a broken arm suffered while ""saving his life,"" I couldn't really see Hope in that role.  Their two styles of comedy were different.  Kaye's slightly sly comedy was perfect for the part.  Though I know Crosby was often the ""handsome"" man in many of his films, I've never really thought of him as such; but his staring opposite the very gifted singer Rosemary Clooney (George's aunt, I believe) seemed to be perfect.  Certainly their duets worked well, and his often bewildered or knowing expressions were a perfect foil for Clooney's irritation.

For dances, Kaye and Vera Ellen were perfect choices.  They looked like they'd been dancing together for years, and there was no sense that either was trying to dominate the scene.  Though the routines are probably pretty meek and tame by ""Dancing with the Stars"" comparison, they are still classics for the 1950s.  I particularly enjoyed the choreography that featured Vera Ellen as its focus.  Her athletic talents and tiny figure were very well presented.

The story itself is charming and so era appropriate.  The notion of a family gathering in front of the TV set to watch a variety show together is so 1950s and also much a part of my own childhood.  The war was still recent enough for people to remember it vividly and yet distant enough for them to have lost contact with those with whom they had served and from whom they thought they could never part.  The series M. A. S.H.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H-Martinis-and-Medicine-Complete-Collection/dp/B000HT3P5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection</a>, captures some of the types of expriences that created these types of intense relationships.  There was a sepia tinted nostalgia among those who had served, that I recognized even from my father's own stories of his war time experiences.

The movie manages to capture that era's sense that life would never be as intense or as purposeful and important as it had been during the war.  It wraps it up in pretty ribbon and surrounds it in snow, making it a perfect holiday film.",1292716800,2,3648,6.011605415860735

This is well worth the upgrade and tops last years significantly.  The clarity and colors are brilliant.  Never have I seen such variations in colors within the set on any edition before.  All shots are spot on.  One prior writer indicated background seemed to fade on occasion or got blurry.  This is by design and how it was filmed and meant to be to ensure you 'focus' attention on the subjects within the shot.  This type of filming was done all the time.  However, the close-ups and images are excellent.  You'll also get all the special features noted within the other 2 disc set (which are all great to view particularly Rosie and Nick Clooney's sections) I wasn't too sure if blu-ray would have made this much of a difference, but it actually does.

White Christmas was the first film made in the Vistavision format and that is how the director and cinematographer wanted the movie to be viewed and that is what I want to see when I watch it!

And there are some wonderful, worthwhile extras -- in HD! -- including Rosemary Clooney's Old Kentucky Home.

Another recommendation:  the colorized Blu-Ray version of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  I have never been a fan of colorized movies -- until now.  Even though, as expected, the fleshtones are a bit off, watching this great movie in color was indeed a revelation!

I first saw this movie as a child, long, long ago, and have never forgotten that final scene with the entire cast in red and white, singing the title song with snow floating down all around. Magical. Today, the plot is, well, nothing less than corny, but you've got to hand it to the stars - they were talented, show biz pros. Vera-Ellen's dancing was amazing, and the sound track contains such classics as ""Count Your Blessings"", ""Sisters"".  Watch it for some old fashioned sentimentality, nostalgia, and post WWII can-do Americanism. It's a lot of fun, even the preposterous parts (breaking into song at the railway station, for instance, or expecting the General to have been intimately acquainted with Privates Kaye and Crosby.)

I notices one or two focus issues, minor in comparison to the brilliant colors and overall sharpness of the images.  Rosemary Clooney talks about how blue Bing's eyes were -- well, you can certainly see that.

The movie is pure musical entertainment -- the story is just something upon which to hang the numbers.  Vera-Ellen was an incredible dancer.  Rosemary and Bing were bron to duet.  And Mary Wickes, as always, stole all her scenes.",1290902400,6,659,4.678260869565217
3801179,5,B001UHOWX8,"I cannot count the times that I have watched Paramount Pictures' White Christmas. This 1954 film has it all-great cast, Irving Berlin's music, sets and colorful dance numbers.  Perhaps, what is best of all, it is set during the Christmas season.

Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen are the core of this splendid film.  Toss in the rugged Dean Jagger as a tough as nails but kind hearted retired US Army Major General operating a New England Inn, you have a tremendous story.

The train trip from Florida to Vermont with Bing, Danny, Rosemary and Vera-Ellen is a delightful romp.  The character interactions make one yearn for the old days of train travel where the pace was relaxed and life just flowed by its own currents.

The number, Sisters, performed by Bing and Danny is just plain hilarious. It is a good showcase of these two fine actors.

The title song White Christmas ends the film in the Vermont inn.  It is one of the most beautiful numbers with gorgeous sets.  The Christmas ballerina and tree are just outstanding.

Audiences made it the top grossing film of 1954.  This two disk Anniversary Edition does not disappoint.  The special features disk is a real Christmas treat with nifty bio sketches.",1289606400,2,1235,4.800947867298579
3801180,5,B001UHOWX8,"In 1954 ""White Christmas"" was welcomed and immortalized as the #1 christmas movie & song.  Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen are forever are remembered and celebrated every holiday season!!!!  Wide Screen and Technicolor in 1954 was the new standard and the vibrant pallet of color for this movie was spectacular to say the least!!!!

When home videos began in the 1970's with VHS analog (240 lines of resolution)  was  fun but very small with full screen and letter box only.  In the 1990's DVD with digital (480 lines and progressive upgrade to 480p (480 x 2).  The digital restored better color and an anamorphic format allows us to view widescreen (in a small scale)  Then in 2005ish blu-ray was develpoed to move us into the HD Home Theater.  And now with full HD Home Theater 55' or bigger!!  (Mine is a 9 footer and white christmas is awesome) we have 1080p and dolby digital sound.

Well this brings us back to ""White Christmas""  If you're like me you have the VHS, DVD, and the 50th Anniversary 2 disc DVD versions.  Each is better than before but not living up to this color extravaganza The way it was always to be seen.

NOW finally Paramount HD releases a version of ""White Christmas"" which exceeds not only all the previous video versions but by far is hands down better than the original 1954 Movie Theater film.  Why????  This is HD digtialized picture all colors are perfect  (ie the song duet with Clooney & Ellen ""Sisters""  their dresses, feather fans are wonderfully detailed and the vibrant eye popping color blue is unbelieveable.  This detail along with all others in the film are seen crystal clear for the first time ever!!!!!  Plus the Dolby Digital sound is flawless you never miss verse, conversation or the spectacular music of Irving Berlin sung by our players!!

Hopefully you get to see this Home Theater Blu-ray edtion as big as possible so you can witness what the 1954 movie audiences experienced.  You'll be watching this more than once and all year around.

NOTE: All SPECIAL FEATURES are the same as th Anniversary Edition except they have been upgraded (2009) to HD except (White Christmas: A Look Back with Rosemary Clooney (2000).

This is Only the blu-ray edition review, no standard dvd included.  This is a keeper in your holiday library.  ENJOY!!!!",1289606400,23,2316,4.756281407035176

It is a highly entertaining film that leaves you with a good feeling inside.  The stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney are all wonderful.

The new Blu Ray transfer is magnificent.  The picture is so sharp, so crystal-clear, so detailed and so alive with brilliant color, that it is hard to believe that the film is over fifty years old.  While watching it, I almost felt like I was there in person.  Fortunately, the picture was shot in real Technicolor, and was filmed using Paramount's VISTA-VISION, which created a much larger image on the film allowing for incredible sharpness of vision.  The newly remastered 5.1 DTS soundtrack fills your viewing room with rich, lush sound and sharp dialog.

3801183,5,B001UHOWX8,"This is probably my favorite Christmas movie. Today I just wanted to write about some of my favorite parts and some things my family and I spoke about during this viewing.

While there are four big stars in this film, for me the real standout is Doris-the blonde in the beginning. She may not have gone to Smith but she gets two great lines. ""Mutual, I'm sure"" in response to Bing's how are you and ""Well, I like that without so much as a kiss your foot or have an apple"" (paraphrase). I have no idea what that means but it's funny!

Bing is, hmm is there a nice way to put this?, really old. ""The Country Girl"" is from the same year but it is in black and white and thus more flattering to the ancient Bing.

As for Danny Kaye, I have to admit we skip his big number, ""Choreography."" I try to watch it every couple of years but this year I was outvoted by the rest of the family and quite frankly I didn't really mind. There's something about that number that is just really weird.

My favorite number is still the Sisters song although if I paid my money to see the Haynes sister and only got one song, I think I'd be pissed. I have a younger sister so we always like to joke around and sing the song ourselves (although I'm no Rosemary Clooney!)

We also spent time trying to figure out in what year this is supposed to take place. While 1954 is the obvious answer due to the release date of this picture, the General wants a position in combat which would indicate Korea which had been completed by that time. I realize that accuracy was never a big priority for studio films but that bothered us. Is there something we missed?

I also must say that I don't feel very sorry for the General. Generals are feted and get all sorts of pensions and bonuses and good stuff. I would feel sorry for the 40-year Private Danny Kaye.

And how annoying is the busybody housekeeper? Who can't even eavesdrop on the phone properly creating a needless rift between Betty and Phil?! She also swore to stop gossiping if her information about Phil and the General was wrong, which it was! Who here thinks she really did stop? I highly doubt it.

But Overall: 5 of course! Highly recommended!",1275523200,4,2177,4.318627450980392

They're wonderful movies in their way, but ...

I like the light, easy, breezy banter of ""White Christmas."" It's fun to watch Bing and Danny whip through classic Irving Berlin numbers like ""Blue Skies"" and ""Heat Wave"" en route to ""playing Santa Claus for the old man"" (marvelous Dean Jagger) and finding love with Rosemary Clooney of the white-hot voice and Vera-Ellen of the mile-long legs.

This anniversary edition boasts beautiful color transfers - I've never seen the credits or the costumes look so rich. The sound is marvelous.

Best of all, Rosemary Clooney does the commentary. Unlike so many commentators, she knows when to be silent and let the film work its magic, and when to pop in with a warmly friendly story about Bing or Berlin. She rarely calls our attention to technical details of the production - she concentrates on the people, which I greatly enjoy.

3801220,5,B001UHOWX8,"Director Michael Curtiz, and writers Norman Krasna and Norman Panama, and Melvin Frank present us with a sentimentally simplistic tale of two showbusiness partners and the performing sisters they encounter.
  While stationed somewhere in Europe during World War II, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis(the legendary Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye), entertain fellow soldiers in General Thomas F. Waverly's(Dean Jagger) unit amid the ruins of a city, bringing a brief moment of delight to the battle-hardened and battle-weary. But shell fire brings the festivities to an end.
  When Phil rescues Bob from a collapsing wall, denting his shoulder in the process, Bob offers to reciprocate, and ends up agreeing to form a stage act with Phil.
 Their postwar lives are filled with nightclub acts, and the ultimate acquisition of their own television show.
  As a favor to an Army buddy (Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer of ""Little Rascals/Our Gang"" fame, who appears only in a photo)the two got to Florida as talent scouts to see the act of his two sisters, Judy and Betty Haynes( the incomparable Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney) at a nightclub called Novello's (Herb Vigrian). The men are attracted to each of the sisters, but the subsequent sit-down session, there is friction between Bob and Betty, and attraction between Phil and Judy, which is more than coherently expressed in one of my favorite dance numbers, ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"", which is still beguiling to watch all these years later.
 Soon, the sisters must bolt to avoid confrontation with the Sheriff( James Parnell) for accidentally  burning a hole in the carpet of their rented residence. Bob and Phil cover for them onstage in an uproarious moment. Bob's exasperation over this increases later when he finds that the Haynes Sisters have commandeered their sleeping quarters on a Northward bound train. But things are smoothed over in the dining quarters with a meal and a song.
  Phil's scheming, resulting from his desire to follow Judy, results in all four ending up in Vermont when Bob had originally wanted to return to New York. They all end up at an inn where they are reunited with none other than General Waverly, the struggling innkeeper who lives with his housekeeper, Emma( Mary Wickes) and his granddaughter, Susan (Anne Whitfield).
 The four entertainers pool their resources and talents (in addition to hiring more dancers) to help bring business to the inn with a splashy number which might be considered politically incorrect by today's standards. But a later number, ""Choreography"" was amusing, and highly suitable for  both Danny Kaye's comic abilities and Vera-Ellen's fairy-like grace.
  Bob and Betty gradually warm to each other amid the lovely tune, ""Count Your Blessings"".
  But at one point, Phil's and Judy's constant scheming goes awry, resulting in misunderstandings, and Betty's departure for a job in New York, where a pursuing Bob uses his connections to make an appeal that will help General Waverly.
  Amid a lively score by Irving Berlin, we encounter a young George Chakiris(later to gain fame as ""West Side Story's"" Bernardo) in a cameo role,and bask in a little harmless holiday hokum with a lot of warmth, all in a film that has earned the right to be deemed a classic.",1261353600,3,3272,5.07089552238806

3801227,5,B001UHOWX8,"What is it about Irvin Berlins White Christmas that makes it so timeless? Is it the rich message within? Is it the down home family values? Some people may claim to you that it's the music, but even then I'm a tad bit skeptical... songs like ""Choreography"" fall a little flat on my ears. What really makes White Christmas a timeless holiday smash in my opinion, is the legs. Lots and lots of long white legs. Everywhere.

Bing Crosby is his usual charming self, with his razor quick wit, and that subtle ""I'm a total f'in jerk in real life"" grin. Danny Kaye is the perfect side man, uneffected by the Bings powerful aura and constantly along for the ride and the fortune, due to a minor injury he sustained to his elbow during the war. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen get themselves entangled into the plot due to their little, quote/unquote ""larceny operation"". At this point the movie starts to take off, with dancing, more dancing and most importantly- legs. Just check out the limbs on Vera Ellen as  she dances to the song ""Mandy.""  Hoooooooooo! In 1954 it was a talented movie crew who could slip those little things past the censorship bureau. Kids won't notice unless they know where to look.

Anyways, this is the type of movie that deserves to be seen in its full grand spectrum. I had the pleasure of seeing this at the movie theater a few days ago, and it was a brilliant sight to behold. On TV it ain't as great, but if you have a killer set, and a fresh copy on DVD or Blu Ray, you might get a close enough experience.",1260057600,3,1532,4.402826855123675

3801231,5,B001UHOWX8,"The print transfer in the two-disc, 55th Anniversary Edition DVD set does justice to Loyal Griggs's vibrant Technicolor cinematography, which makes the 1954 movie look appropriately like a bright red candy box. Although Frank Capra's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Wonderful-Life/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Wonderful Life</a>&nbsp;deserves its place among the pantheon of Christmas movies, this comparative confection still deserves special mention. Granted the plot, what there is of one, is rather thin, it is splashy good fun directed by the dependably versatile Michael Curtiz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/6305736650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>) with several Irving Berlin standards and four superb variety performers in their prime. As much as Capra's film is an annual tradition, it is really this film that I look forward to the most of all the holiday classics.

The storyline focuses on two former soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, both song-and-dance men who become best friends when Davis saves Wallace from a falling building during WWII. After years of post-war success on Broadway and the nightclub circuit, they become reconnected with their gruff but lovable former army commander, General Waverly. The general now owns a Vermont ski lodge, but he is treading water financially since there is no snow as Christmas approaches. As it turns out, the Haynes sisters, Betty and Judy, are playing the lodge during the holidays, and of course, romantic entanglements ensue all the way through the big finale when all four star in a show that they hope will save the general's lodge.

All of this seems rather incidental to the musical numbers showcased in the then-revolutionary widescreen process called VistaVision. The most relaxed of actors during this era, Bing Crosby plays Wallace with his natural lan, and he croons the classic title tune early on and leads the group sing of the same song at the end. In contrast, Danny Kaye plays Davis with his mercurial style intact, though compared to his other films of the period, he is relatively subdued here. With her smoky, silken vocal skills on display, Rosemary Clooney plays Betty, Wallace's love interest, with aplomb and complements Crosby easily on ""Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep)"". She also delivers a nice torchy Berlin tune with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"" despite some silly man-choreography.

I have to say the most impressive performer of the quartet is Vera-Ellen, a phenomenal dancer who was the equal of Astaire and Kelly at her peak. She makes even Kaye look good in their musical duets - ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" and the amusing Martha Graham riff, ""Choreography"". However, her best numbers are with dancer John Brascia - the elaborate ""Mandy"" number where her pliable, slender frame seems to be everywhere on the screen, and the brief rehearsal number, ""Abraham"", where she and Brascia snap, pop, clap, kick and swing with unerring military precision. It's worth noting that her singing is dubbed by vocalist Trudy Stevens, which is pointed out by Clooney on the less-than-informative audio commentary track. Much better is the 16-minute retrospective interview with Clooney on Disc Two where her natural sense of humor emerges.

There are other numbers worth mentioning in the movie - the duet, ""Sisters"", done first straight by the women and later by the men as a comedy routine in half-drag (Kaye steals this bit handily with his over-the-top clowning); the foursome on the vintage Berlin ""Snow"" and ""Gee, I Wish I was Back in the Army""; and of course, the title tune at the end. Way over on the sidelines, Dean Jagger lends his warm dignity to the role of the retired general, and Mary Wickes plays Emma the housekeeper in her typically sarcastic manner. This is undemanding entertainment and a dependable holiday classic that feels like a favorite well-worn blanket.

The remaining DVD extras are all on Disc Two. They include six new featurettes - ""Backstage Stories from White Christmas"" with historians and critics telling the tales along with remembrances from dancer George Chakiris; ""Rosemary's Old Kentucky Home"" looks at her childhood home which has since turned into a museum; ""Bing Crosby: Christmas Crooner"" takes a superficial look at the star with interviews with his widow Kathryn Crosby and son Harry; ""Danny Kaye: Joy to the World"" focuses more on Kaye's philanthropic work with UNICEF; ""Irving Berlin's White Christmas"" is about the origins of the classic song; and ""White Christmas: From Page to Stage"" shows how the recent Broadway show evolved.  There are also two theatrical trailers included.",1258416000,14,4781,5.454054054054054
3801232,5,B001UHOWX8,"I first saw ""White Christmas"" when I was a teenager back in the 60's. I loved it! After Bing Crosby's death the film was unavailable for many years due to issues with his estate. For at least ten years, I missed watching it on TV every Christmas season. When it was finally released on VHS, I purchased it immediately. I was in heaven. When my daughters were young and I popped ""White Christmas"" in the VCR, they would say, ""Oh no, not again!"" It became a running joke in our family for me to ask, ""Anyone want to watch White Christmas?"" Well, my daughters are in their 30s now and VHS has given way to DVD. I have the first DVD version which has been viewed over 100 times. After reading the review of the improved quality, I've decided to purchase this upgrade. The movie is simply wonderful! It's romantic, funny and highly entertaining! The Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont is simply gorgeous. The inn was actually a movie set but how I wish there were such a place! If you are undecided about purchasing this movie, just read these classic lines in which the Danny Kaye (Phil Davis) character said to the Bing Crosby character (Bob Wallace)  ""My dear partner, when what's left of you gets around to what's left to be gotten, what's left to be gotten won't be worth getting whatever it is you have left."" ...to which Bing Crosby replies, ""When I figure out what that means I'll come up with a crushing reply.""

Is there anyone who hasn't heard (and maybe even hummed along with) Bing Crosby singing ""White Christmas"" and/or Bing and Rosemary singing ""Counting Your Blessings""?  And who can forget the hilarious rendition by Bing and Danny of ""Sisters""?  The ending show put on by the stars for the ""General"" (admirably portrayed by the late, great Dean Jagger) can't help but bring tears to your eyes.  This classic movie was made during a period when morality was still envogue and does not, therefore, contain even a single curse word or sexual innuendo.  It is genuinely a true family movie in every sense of the meaning.  It also instills the lesson that when one jumps to conclusions without having their facts straight, results can lead to unjustified, even hurtful actions.

Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye are sensational together and Rosemary Cloony and Vera-Ellen are a great addition to this movie.

Shortly after WWII two former army buddies are working the night club singing scene when they run into two 'Sisters, Sisters.....' and then life really takes off for them.

This movie takes you to Vermont, just in time for the ski season, before Christmas, and well, Vermont just so happens to be quite hot.  Throughout the movie there is just great fun and even better music and even some good dancing.  Danny Kaye has some great slap stick comedy, he sings and dances with Vera Allen.  Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney link up and sing together.  There is romance in the air and still, there is no snow.  What to do?  They are visiting a ski resort, attempting to make some dough, but no snow, no show, no dough.

Bing Crosby goes out of his way to help and the story becomes so very good after this.

3801256,5,B001UHOWX8,"Although Frank Capra's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Wonderful-Life/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Wonderful Life</a>&nbsp;deserves its place among the pantheon of Christmas movies, this comparative confection from 1954 still deserves special mention. Granted the plot, what there is of one, is rather thin, it is splashy good fun directed by the dependably versatile Michael Curtiz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B00009W0WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>) with several Irving Berlin standards and four superb variety performers in their prime. As much as Capra's film is an annual tradition, it is really this film that I look forward to the most of all the holiday classics.

The storyline focuses on two former soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, both song-and-dance men who become best friends when Davis saves Wallace from a falling building during WWII. After years of post-war success on Broadway and the nightclub circuit, they become reconnected with their gruff but lovable former army commander, General Waverly. The general now owns a Vermont ski lodge, but he is treading water financially since there is no snow as Christmas approaches. As it turns out, the Haynes sisters, Betty and Judy, are playing the lodge during the holidays, and of course, romantic entanglements ensue all the way through the big finale when all four star in a show that they hope will save the general's lodge.

All of this seems rather incidental to the musical numbers showcased in the then-revolutionary widescreen process called VistaVision. The most relaxed of actors during this era, Bing Crosby plays Wallace with his natural &eacute;lan, and he croons the classic title tune early on and leads the group sing of the same song at the end. In contrast, Danny Kaye plays Davis with his mercurial style intact, though compared to his other films of the period, he is relatively subdued here. With her smoky, silken vocal skills on display, Rosemary Clooney plays Betty, Wallace's love interest, with aplomb and complements Crosby easily on ""Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep)"". She also delivers a nice torchy Berlin tune with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"" despite some silly man-choreography.

I have to say the most impressive performer of the quartet is Vera-Ellen, a phenomenal dancer who was the equal of Astaire and Kelly at her peak. She makes even Kaye look good in their musical duets - ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" and the amusing Martha Graham riff, ""Choreography"". However, her best numbers are with dancer John Brascia - the elaborate ""Mandy"" number where her pliable, slender frame seems to be everywhere on the screen, and the brief rehearsal number, ""Abraham"", where she and Brascia snap, pop, clap, kick and swing with unerring military precision. It's worth noting that her singing is dubbed by vocalist Trudy Stevens, which is pointed out by Clooney on the less-than-informative audio commentary track in the 2007 DVD package. Much better is the 16-minute retrospective interview with Clooney where her natural sense of humor emerges.

There are other numbers worth mentioning in the movie - the duet, ""Sisters"", done first straight by the women and later by the men as a comedy routine in half-drag (Kaye steals this bit handily with his over-the-top clowning); the foursome on the vintage Berlin ""Snow"" and ""Gee, I Wish I was Back in the Army""; and of course, the title tune at the end. Way over on the sidelines, Dean Jagger lends his warm dignity to the role of the retired general, and Mary Wickes plays Emma the housekeeper in her typically sarcastic manner. Special mention needs to be given to Loyal Griggs's vibrant Technicolor cinematography, which makes the entire movie look appropriately like a bright red candy box, and the print transfer in the DVD almost fully captures the original visual quality. This is undemanding entertainment and a dependable holiday classic that feels like a favorite well-worn blanket.",1228089600,6,4102,5.475513428120063

3801275,5,B001UHOWX8,"Back in 1954, director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962, who won the Oscar for Best Director for the 1942 film ""Casablanca"") directed a musical that has become a beloved Yuletide classic for many people (myself included): ""White Christmas"".  With the all-star cast of Bing Crosby (1903-1977), Danny Kay (1913-1987), Rosemary Clooney (1928-2002), Vera Ellen (1921-1981) and Mary Wickes (1910-1995), the film is often regarded as an updated remake of the 1942 classic ""Holiday Inn"", which also starred Bing Crosby and featured the same classic Yuletide song, ""White Christmas"".  Though the two films do have many similarities (they're both musicals with lots of song and dance and they both have two main male characters), there are sufficient differences in their respective plots to make each film a unique viewing experience.

""White Christmas"" begins on a World War II battlefield with soldiers performing a Christmas show for their fellow soldiers.  The two starring soldiers are Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye).  During the performance, all of the soldiers in attendance pay homage to their commander, General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger).  The film then moves forward to its present day of 1954 where it finds Wallace & Davis as being very popular and successful on-stage song & dance performers.  After one of their performances, they go to a nightclub where they a performance by two beautiful sisters: Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy Haynes (Vera Ellen).  Bob & Phil become infatuated with the pair (Phil more than Bob).  They meet each other and Phil sneakily arranges for himself and Bob to go to Vermont, where the Haynes sisters are going, instead of their planned destination for their next performance.  Bob isn't too happy initially with Phil's subterfuge, but relents and enjoys the trip with the Haynes sisters to the Vermont ski lodge.  Sadly, when they arrive, there isn't any snow; but they quickly discover who owns the ski lodge: their former commander, the retired General Thomas F. Waverly, who is assisted by his daughter Anne Waverly (Anne Whitfield) and Emma Allen (Mary Wickes).  The unfortunate lack of snow isn't very good for the ski lodges business, but Bob & Phil decide to help the retired general in the best way that they know.

Songs by Irving Berlin in ""White Christmas"" include many wonderful and catchy tunes as listed below.  (Vera Ellen's singing was dubbed by Trudy Stevens.)

* ""The Old Man/Gee I Wish I Was Back In The Army"" (5 stars, performed by Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and chorus).
* ""Sisters"" (5+ stars, Rosemary Clooney, Trudy Stevens and chorus).
* ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" (4 stars, Danny Kaye with the Skylarks & chorus.)
* ""Snow"" (5+ stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, Rosemary Clooney, Trudy Stevens and chorus).
* ""Blue Skies/Mandy"" (4 stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and chorus.)
* ""Choreography"" (5 stars, Danny Kaye, the Skylarks & chorus.)
* ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"" (5 stars, Bing Crosby.)
* ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" (5 stars, Rosemary Clooney.)
* ""What Can You Do With The General"" (5+ stars, Bing Crosby.)
* ""White Christmas"" (5+ stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Trudy Stevens & chorus.)

""White Christmas"" has deservedly become an annual Yuletide classic that will be enjoyed by many generations to come.  Overall, I rate the film with 5 out of 5 stars.  Also on the DVD is an excellent commentary by Rosemary Clooney.  Sadly, ""White Christmas"" was Vera Ellen's second-to-last film after she decided to retire from acting.",1200182400,3,3570,5.0717948717948715

3801283,5,B001UHOWX8,"The movie gets five stars, but I can't get used to this anamorphic widescreen version.  The movie was restored several years ago and to me my VHS copy looks better than this one.

Great Irving Berlin score. The plot is simple but charming. Leaving the Army after W.W.II, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis team up to become a top song-and-dance act. Phil makes it his mission to find Wallace a wife.  They meet a pair of beautiful sisters (Clooney and Ellen) who also have a song-and-dance act. Bob and Phil follow the sisters to a Vermont lodge, only to find their former commander, General Waverly, as the lodge owner. A series of romantic mix-ups ensue as the performers try to help the General. Many people think this is a remake of Bing's 1942 film, ""Holiday Inn"", but it really isn't.  The only similarities are the song ""White Chrismas"" and the Vermont Inn is the remodeled Connecticut Inn used in ""Holdiday Inn"".

Bing is his usual charming self, complete with his jazz lingo ad libs and beautiful singing voice. Parts of his big hits ""Blue Skies"", ""Heat Wave"" have been added to the score.
 A rather subdued Danny Kaye puts in one of his best performances. His singing is good and his dancing is ok.
Vera Ellen does some wonderful dance numbers.  People rave about ""Mandy"" and ""The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing"" but take a look at ""Abraham""- she's incredible!
Rosemary Clooney adds her near perfect voice and a commentary to this film.",1198800000,2,1445,4.665354330708661
3801284,4,B001UHOWX8,"This is a great family movie, especially if you watch it every year at Christmas time like we do. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye make a great team, Bing doing the singing (along with many trademark Crosby turns of phrase) and Danny doing the joking and some dancing. There's lots more to be said about the movie, of course: read IMDB or wikipedia.

The DVD version itself is ok. The biggest disappointment was in the special features. They have 2 theatrical trailers and an interview with Rosemary Clooney, which are ok. But the commentary track is, I hate to say, really bad. Basically it consists of Rosemary chuckling at different points in the movie. She reveals a few interesting tidbits, but by and large it's extremely disappointing. We were looking forward to lots of stories about the cast and crew, verification of trivia we had read, but simply got a few reminiscences about her and Bing Crosby and a bunch of chuckling. I'm enough of a die-hard fan of the movie that I watched the commentary all the way through, but my wife gave up part way through, it was so bad.

But the music and production numbers are as good as any classic musical. This movie has the destinction of being the first film ever produced in the VistaVision process. This was an early motion picture High Fidelity medium. The frame had twice the resolving power of regular 35mm.

3801292,4,B001UHOWX8,"Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) meet in the Army during World War II.  Davis saves Wallace's life during an air raid and uses the incident to guilt his way into show business.  It seems that Wallace was a famous singer before the war and can't say no to Davis who wants to become his partner.  When the two encounter their old general at a Vermont inn, they hatch several convoluted schemes to help him out.  It's all done in a lighthearted way and there are plenty of musical interludes.

Bing Crosby is perfect as Bob Wallace and Danny Kaye manages to hold his own for the most part.  Kaye is certainly the better dancer and physical comic but his singing voice was exposed a time or two during the course of the film.  The story is terrific for the first half or so, but gets into trouble when a misunderstanding causes a rift between Crosby and his would-be girlfriend.  She is so bitter and judgmental toward him, giving him no chance to even explain what's really going on, that by the end I don't even want him to take her back.  But most of the story is good fun even if it doesn't all make perfect sense.  It's one of those movies that requires you to sit back and enjoy the silliness.

This movie is a Christmas classic and I watch it each year.  The chemistry between Crosby and Kaye gives the movie great heart and the snappy patter is exceptionally sharp.",1197331200,7,1390,4.38671875
3801293,5,B001UHOWX8,"A great movie with a great cast and, of course, great music! Having said that, I must agree with another reviewer who feels the 'Choreography' number is out of place. Still, all in all, a wonderful way to spend an evening as Christmas approaches. I have the 2000 release DVD and had not intended to buy a newer version until it finally comes out in high-def, but I noticed that while the 2000 version has an aspect ratio of 1.85 this edition is 2.35. Perhaps now the entire letter written by Betty will be viewable onscreen instead of the bottom line being missing. I haven't had an opportunity to see it, so I don't know. As beautiful as the colors are in this movie, I can't wait to see it in full 1080 resolution on my big TV! I do hope it is released that way soon. I don't know whether HDDVD or BlueRay will win the war, but whichever format this movie is released in is the one I will buy.

Now for the Blu-Ray. I purchased this over Christmas, 2010, in hopes it wouldn't be another one of those transfers that looks the same as the one being replaced. I'm glad to say it isn't...in fact, White Christmas finally looks the way it should! Having bought each previous release starting with VHS and progressing through every DVD release, I can tell you that the studio never made the previous releases look really good. White Christmas always had a picture quality that was below what I expected from a DVD and I took a leap of faith with the Blu-Ray. This time I was rewarded with a picture that is absolutely gorgeous! During the 'Sisters' routine you can see the individual strands of the feathers and it gives you the sensation of being there in person. On board the train when the bar-tender is making the drinks, the glasses and drinks look real. This is one time I can confidently say there is no comparison between the DVD and Blu-Ray versions...Blu-Ray wins hands-down all across the board. I think you can tell that this is one of my cherished movies by how many releases I own, more cherished now because it finally looks great. I can recommend this version whole-heartedly without worrying that someone will buy it and not see any improvement over their older version, and I do recommend it. If you love 'White Christmas', then this is what you have been waiting for...you won't be disappointed!",1197158400,15,2310,4.513126491646778

3801295,5,B001UHOWX8,"""White Christmas"" opened in The Big Apple's (New York's) Radio City Music Hall in 1954 to record breaking crowds.  With Irving Berlin's music and the song ""White Christmas"" already a huge success, this show was sure to be a winner!  An unprecedented 6 weeks of rehearsal time was granted for making the movie before even shooting it, which ensured it's perfection.

The movie displays the superb singing and acting talents of super-crooner Bing Crosby, the multitalented singing, dancing, comedy talents of the extraordinary and unsurpassed Danny Kaye, the beautiful melodic voice and wonderful acting talents of Rosemary Clooney, and the sensational dancing and acting talents of Vera Ellen.  Danny and Vera danced and sang their way through this movie together as a couple.  What a talent combo!  It should be noted that the sensational Vera Ellen only went on to make one more movie in 1957 before she retired from the silver screen.  Also note that Vera is the only one whose singing voice was dubbed in because it was said that she couldn't sing, but she sure could dance enough to make up for it!

Paramount's famous designer Edith Head designed the costumes for the movie and the girls' gowns and dance costumes are absolutely stunning!  Even the guys look great.  You'll notice Danny Kaye with a grey-blue suit, with matching socks and shoes in a dance number that really accent an extension of the movement of his whole body all the way down to his feet.

The show begins on Christmas Eve, in Germany, 1944.  In the midst of airplane gunfire and bombs falling from the sky, a USO-type show put on by Army Captain Bob Wallace (Bing) and Private Phil Davis (Danny) attempts to entertain their troop.  Their commander is General Waverly, a Major General (a 2-star general), a really nice guy and they absolutely love him.  Right after the show, Davis hurts his arm pushing Wallace out of way and milks it every time he wants something from Wallace.  Davis uses the ""how I hurt my arm saving your life"" routine to get Wallace to include him in his show act after he gets out of the war and all through the picture. Hence, the act name ""Wallace and Davis"".

As Wallace and Davis are getting very well known in show biz, they meet the 2 sisters of an old army friend. You only see the guy's photo but I think it's a grown-up Alfalfa from the Little Rascals.  The Hanes sisters are Betty (Rosemary) and Judy (Vera) Hanes.  You first see them doing an act ""Sisters"" and the show soon takes a turn toward match-making.  Davis and Judy decide to ""help"" Wallace and Betty get together.  Davis figures that if he gets Wallace interested in a woman, Davis can have some down-time for himself.

The boys soon follow the girls to their gig for the holidays at The Columbia Inn, in Pine Tree, Vermont.  They are surprised to see no snow AND the Inn owned by their friend, the now retired General Waverly.  The General has sunk all his money into the Inn and there's no business, so Wallace and Davis decide to bring their whole New York show, cast and crew to Vermont to put on an extravaganza to help out the General's business.

The movie has TONS of great songs, sung by everyone except Vera.  Vera gets a few notes in here and there, but, they are someone else's voice dubbed in.  Songs include ""Sisters,"" ""White Christmas,"" Counting Your Blessings,"" ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing,"" (Song and dance), ""Snow,"" ""Mandy, There's A Minister Handy,"" ""Gee I Wish I Was Back in the Army,"" and ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me.""

On a side note, the song ""Sisters"" brings back fond memories for me.  A friend, Karen, and I worked together on the Training Staff for about 10 years and we had gotten to be really close friends, like sisters.  Like most people today, we were overworked and underpaid.  Whenever things got stressful at work, we would sometimes pop out of our cubicles, go arm in arm, and sing a few bars from that song.  It always lightened up everybody's' load for a couple of minutes.  So, whenever I hear that song, I always think of Karen. I'm sure the movie will trigger some memories for some of you, too.

On another side note, you may notice George Chakiris in the dance scenes.  He was seen as a supporting dancer in many movies before appearing in ""West Side Story"".  An interview with Rosemary Clooney from 2000 is also included in the special features.

The movie finale is superb, very heartwarming and very Christmassy!  Of course, there is a happy ending.  (Well, who wants to see an UN-happy ending?)

Can't imagine there is anybody on planet earth who has NOT seen this movie unless they have been in a coma since 1954 but just in case, this movie is absolutely FANTASTIC!  It's a movie that you will likely watch over and over again through the years, certainly during the Christmas holidays.

Love the dresses the girls are wearing for the finale, too!  I always said I was going to make myself one just like it and darn it I'm still gonna do it!  I have to stop WAITING for the time to appear and just TAKE the time to do it!

Anyway, get the movie for yourself or give it as a Christmas gift.",1196899200,10,5130,4.577850877192983

However, as a fan of this movie, I must comment that I'm happy to see this movie come out in a collection seperate from the dreaded label of ""WIDESCREEN COLLECTION"" that many Paramount movies possess. Why Paramount was doing that to all their movies is beyond me, but over the last few months, they've begun to stop.

However, this does not mean the DVD is a new release. This IS the exact same DVD release originally printed in 2000. The cover and slipcover are the only new features of this release. If you're like me who's anal retentive and wants to get a fresh crisp copy that's decorated only with words and art from the movie, this exchange may be worth the extra $10.00 or so, but only for that reason.

Not so! This new ""remaster"" is just as dreary-looking as the older DVD. Grainy and soft with an unstable look and dull colors except in some brightly lit ""performance"" scenes. Also lots of dirt marks and scattered speckles, plus an ugly splice or two. And NO new extras!

3801306,4,B001UHOWX8,"Firstly, I should disclose that I've never seen IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE - I was never able to catch it when I was a kid, nor as an adult. I watched White Christmas when I was 12, and was completely enchanted by it. Twenty years later, and it still a film that holds tremendous charm for me.

We live in such a selfish postmodernist cynical world - optimism and hope are in short supply, especially in a generation of adults raised on a narrow-minded pop-culture diet. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is great, but every now and then I need a reminder that being kind to another human being isn't something to be sneered at. White Christmas is that film.

Bing Crosby is paired with Danny Kaye, which surprised me initially considering he's usually seen with Bob Hope. There's a different energy there, but it's no less fun to watch. Bing Crosby brings his wonderful voice, and Danny Kaye brings his humour and sense of fun. Perfect. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Lynn are wonderful as the Haines sisters. And Dean Jagger is very dignified as General Waverley. Mary Wickes is also fun to watch as the nosy Emma Allen. The only jarring note (for me) is an odd modern dance number right in the middle of the film. Whuh? That sequence hasn't at all dated well.

For me, this is the film that I try and watch every Christmas. And with its appearance on DVD, I finally (at last!) have a permanent copy of my favourite Christmas film! Isn't technology wonderful?",1180051200,3,1447,4.515267175572519

3801325,5,B001UHOWX8,"I saw this movie for the first time this Christmas season.  We rented it from Blockbuster, and I watched it a few times already.  I am thinking I will have to buy it.  I won't give you a summary since others already have, but here are my thoughts on the movie:

Bing Crosby's voice alone is enough to make me watch this movie.  In the beginning of the film, he sings White Christmas in front of all the men in the army.  When he sings many of the men look down and get tears in their eyes.  Although it was probably done as an effect for the movie, his performance is moving enough to make you get teary-eyed without having to act.  All four of the main characters' voices blend together really well, especially in ""Snow.""

This is one musical where you actually love the musical interludes - because that means dancing! Vera-Ellen has to be the most physically fit person that has ever existed.  I couldn't imagine doing the dancing that she does for 2 solid minutes without falling over!  All the dancing is fun to watch and covers a wide spectrum of styles.  You get soft-shoe, tap, ballroom, show, and even modern!

I love all the fun characters that pull the movie along in their mischievousness - the guilt-tripping friend, the plotting sister, the snoopy housekeeper.  And of course the actors and actresses themselves are what drive the movie.  Bing Crosby is feeling and charming, Danny Kaye is dramatic and fun, Rosemary Clooney is serious yet passionate, and Vera-Ellen is light-hearted and oh so talented!  On top of the incredible casting, it's amazing that a movie with that much wonderful singing and dancing could also have a heart-warming and fun plot.  The movie is a bit on the cheesy side, but that only makes it more fun.  You often find yourself saying, ""Oh bother!  Here we go again!""  Besides, what's a Christmas movie without a bit of cheese?

I highly recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",1167350400,2,1937,4.556521739130435

Through the creative movie magic of Hollywood, the film opens with a sound stage depicting a scene out of World War II, Christmas Eve, 1944, and the troops bid a fond farewell to General Waverly (Dean Jagger), which later segues way to post-war America.  Two fictitious World War II veterans, the former Capt. Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and PFC Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) venture out as an entertainment duo who woo the nightclub crowds.  They decide to add an addition to the act, two women, Betty(Rosemary Clooney) and Judy(Vera-Ellen), two sisters who are also singers, after they find out that the women have been forced out of their apartment by their landlord. The four book a gig at a Vermont inn, which surprisingly is run by General Waverly, and the last hour of the film centers around dedicating a show to the man.

The film is rich with plenty of songs and dance performances.  Indeed, the film shares company with other movie musicals that came out during the early to mid 1950s.  With Great American composer Irving Berlin providing the musical compositions for the film, how could they go wrong?  This is pure entertainment with all the holiday galore that has a combination of a Norman Rockwell painting with all the tinsel and quaint surroundings of a Vermont country inn to the colorful excitement of an upbeat Broadway musical.

Crosby, Kaye and company sang snippets and full versions of Berlin's tunes.  There is much patriotic fervor during the opening scene of film, which begins with the very sentimental ""Gee I Wish I Was Back In the Army."" Snippets of ""Blue Skies,"" ""Heat Wave,"" and ""Let Me Sing,"" are sung by Crosby and Kaye.  Crosby sings a sentimental version of ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sleep"" to Rooney as well as the most popular songs in musical history, ""White Christmas,"" which has sold over 170 million recordings (noted in the Guinness Book of World Records) during the finale.  The standout numbers and performances in the movie are the collaborative scenes done by the four singing together or as duets, the fun and delightful ""Sisters"" and ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, the patriotic ""Gee I Wish I Was Back In The Army,"" the torch song rendering of ""Love You Didn't Do Right By Me,"" which bears similarities to ""Love Me Or Leave Me,"" and the upbeat minstrel number, ""Mandy,"" which has a riverboat look and feel with painted black-faced performers and nineteenth century costumes.

The collector's gift edition of WHITE CHRISTMAS that came out in 1994 is by far exceptional.  The film was released in the innovative VistaVision, and has been better enhanced with this widescreen version.  The package came in a nice collector's box which included a souvenir book with brief commentary by Rosemary Clooney and behind the scene photographs of the actors on the set of the film, the Decca records release of songs from the movie in cd format that includes Peggy Lee and Trudy Stevens's vocals, a copy of Rosemary Clooney's script, and a nice b/w promotional photo of the four actors.

When watching WHITE CHRISTMAS or hearing the memorable tunes, Christmas memories may abound.  For any holiday movie aficionado or anyone who enjoys movie musicals, add WHITE CHRISTMAS to your collection.",1166227200,,3543,4.961148648648648
3801328,5,B001UHOWX8,Saw this film when I was 7 years old.  Bought the VHS version in 1990. I play it every Christmas season and my grand children love it.  It's a tradition  and I still cry at the end.  The BEST Christmas musical ever created!  Now it's on DVD. Wonderful for gifts to the whole family and your friends.,1166054400,,299,4.175438596491228
3801329,5,B001UHOWX8,"I know it sounds scary, but it's just one of the many reasons why this is one of the greatest films ever.  Don't be misled by comparisons to Bing's earlier ""Holiday Inn.""  That's a great film too, but when they held a sprig of mistletoe over ""Holiday Inn,"" and gave it a big, warm, Technicolor kiss -- they ended up with ""White Christmas.""

Rosemary Clooney is a star here. She's at her most gorgeous and in her best voice ever.  Hearing her rich, beautiful alto renditions of ""Count Your Blessings,"" or the mournful, haunting ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me,"" is like pulling a thick comforter up to your chin on a snowy night.  Clooney went on to a long illustrious career, of course, becoming an acclaimed jazz vocalist in her later years, but I will always love the Rosemary of this period the best.

As much a star, but with a lot more twinkle, is the real stand-out, Vera-Ellen, who deserves extra accolades for being one of the first stars to be known only by her first name.  She has the added distinction of being the sole reason for hearing someone at our house say every Christmas, ""Look how TINY her WAIST is!""

She was a power-house dancer, but has never garnered the acclaim that she deserves.  Her other best-known role was ""Miss Turnstiles"" in Gene Kelly's ""On the Town,"" but her dancing skills are highlighted more in ""White Christmas,"" being the only real dancer in the quartet.  Director Michael Curtiz brings in John Brascia, an athletic and powerful dancer in his own right, just to keep up with her.  He seems to, but, honestly, you can't take your eyes off Vera-Ellen long enough to know for sure.

Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye bring all their star power to complete the quartet of principal characters.  Crosby is smooth as usual, and a little understated, with his legendary pipe and even more legendary pipes, while Kaye's comic craziness is the spike in the eggnog.  Their duet in drag (not full drag, mind you, like..say... Gene Hackman in ""The Bird Cage"") is a highlight of the film that still makes me smile after all these years.

Take these four superstars, dress them up in some of Edith Head's best designs, give them wonderful songs from Irving Berlin, add great supporting actors like Mary Wickes and Dean Jagger, a splash of Vista-Vision, a heapin' helpin' of Technicolor, march in a platoon of veterans, pour in a tanker-truck load of sentimentality, then tie it all up in some pretty Christmas wrapping, and you have yourself a classic.",1165190400,98,2474,4.655172413793103
3801330,5,B001UHOWX8,"Absolute best Christmas movie.  If you like watching movies from an era where life was simplier and you love musicals, you will love this movie.  I have the soundtrack as well, although they have a replacement for Rosemary Clooney since she had a special contract and couldn't be on it.  Its the xmas album I listen to the most.  Again, definitely my favorite Christmas movie out of about 30 Christmas movies that I own.",1164672000,5,420,4.635135135135135
3801331,5,B001UHOWX8,"White Christmas is my all time FAVORITE movie. I've loved it since the first time my parents made my sister and I watch it twelve years ago (I was 9).  I've watched it so many times that I can not only say/sing the entire film, but I think I could probably act out the entire thing, too.  I feel that it is a movie that can be enjoyed year round, not just at Christmas. In fact, I don't really even consider it a Christmas film. I mean it only really has 1 Christmas song in it, and most of the movie doesn't take place at Christmas.

The cast does a wonderful job with the acting, singing, and dancing. They are all amazing, especially Vera Ellen in the dancing numbers...I didn't realize someone could move their foot that fast until I watched the coreography number.

My favorite two songs in the film are ""Sisters"" and ""The Best Things..."", but all the songs are fabulous.

If you like musicals, buy this film. You won't be disappointed.",1164672000,5,941,4.385057471264368
3801332,2,B001UHOWX8,"Having seen HOLIDAY INN at least a dozen times, I realized that I'd

never seen its reworked version, WHITE Christmas until it showed up on

TCM the other day. Aside from some great musical numbers (esp. the

dance sequences) this was an overlong snore. The plot was so convoluted

for such little payoff -- all that secrecy/misunderstanding for the

General's surprise party. And nothing says ""Christmas cheer and warmth""

better than a stage recreation of a bombed-out European landscape! By

contrast, HOLIDAY INN, had a nicely paced inherent structure in its

telling of an inn open only on holidays and some truly memorable tunes

and musical numbers. That film's atmosphere and warmth seemed genuine

and not wrapped up in the false sentimentality and schmaltz of the

remake. The only reason to buy a DVD of WHITE Christmas would be to

have the ability to skip to the dance scenes.",1164585600,5,889,4.89261744966443

3801334,5,B001UHOWX8,"This film has been a favorite of mine for as long as I can remember.  Sure, it may be a little cheesy, easily predictable and perhaps even dated, but I can't help but love this classic film.

Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Danny Kay, Vera-Ellen, Dean Jagger and Mary Wickes sing, dance, snoop and grump their way through this outstanding bit of film.

Crosby and Kaye are a couple of performers that following WWII and a 'saved life', team up to form a hit singing/dancing duo that meet up with the two sisters of an Army buddy a short time before Christmas.  What follows is fun romp of good intentions and misunderstandings that culminate in the perfect ending to any Christmas film!  In between the humerous beginning and touching ending, we're gifted with some wonderful song and dance routines and simply a lot of fun.

This DVD is a true gift to fans of the film, as the late-great Rosemary Clooney sat down for an audio commentary of the film that makes this priceless to fans of the film.  There are many that prefer the film, Holiday Inn, but for my money and my enjoyment, you can't beat this film.",1161820800,4,1108,4.5376884422110555

I truly adore this movie, it is and will always be one of my most favorite movies of all time.  Bing, Vera, Danny, and Rosemary are the best, and as far as I am concerned, THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER MADE.

3801339,5,B001UHOWX8,"It is rare to see an old movie that combines good songs, great actors, and a sharp script.  Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, and Rosemary Clooney can brighten anyone's Christmas in this movie.  The plot revolves around Crosby and Kay, old army buddies who make it big in show business after the WWII.  They meet two sisters who are going to a Vermont Inn for a Christmas show.  The Inn is not in good financial shape, and it turns out to be owned by the general who was in charge of Crosby and Kay during WWII.  The musical score is provided by Irving Berlin, and includes such songs as ""Count Your Blessings,"" ""Blue Skies,"" and its namesake, ""White Christmas.""  Most of the dances are well choreographed.  There is one that is in the middle of the movie that isn't entertaning, but overall, the dances are great.  I am a big fan of both Bing Crosby and Danny Kay, so this movie is right up my alley.

My favorite part about it is that it required pure talent; there was nothing fake or phony about the elegance of their dancing or the pure sounds of their voices. I wish there were more movies today that weren't just awed because of their special effects or computer graphics.

3801347,5,B001UHOWX8,"To some, White Christmas is a song that is heard on the radio in December. But to others, White Christmas also refers to a great movie that has stood the test of time.

Having a score by Irving Berlin is on the same scale as having John Williams manage the music. There are many great songs heard throughout this movie. While older people may appreciate these a bit more, the younger generation would also benefit from the songs. In a sad world where rap is the dominating music genre, many have not heard lyrical music. The overwhelming majority of 5-21 year olds are not quite sure who Bing Crosby and Perry Como are. Some aren't even sure who John Lennon or Brian Wilson were.

The movie is also great. The actors can also sing and dance, something that isn't done all too often today. One of the best points of this movie is that everyone can watch it--it's not rated but is probably worth a ""G"". You don't find gems like this one very often in the modern world where there is no cursing and no sex.

One of the extras is an interview with Rosemary Clooney. Quite a few interesting facts are brought up, including details on the production of the movie and how it was originally to involve Fred Astaire.

3801350,5,B001UHOWX8,"Although Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" deserves its place among the pantheon of Christmas movies, this comparative confection from 1954 still deserves special mention. Granted the plot, what there is of one, is rather thin, it is splashy good fun directed by the dependably versatile Michael Curtiz with several Irving Berlin standards and four superb variety performers in their prime. As much as Capra's film is an annual tradition, it is really this film that I look forward to the most of all the holiday classics.

The storyline focuses on two former soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, both song-and-dance men who become best friends when Davis saves Wallace from a falling building during WWII. After years of post-war success on Broadway and the nightclub circuit, they become reconnected with their gruff but lovable former army commander, General Waverly. The general now owns a Vermont ski lodge, but he is treading water financially since there is no snow as Christmas approaches. As it turns out, the Haynes sisters, Betty and Judy, are playing the lodge during the holidays, and of course, romantic entanglements ensue all the way through the big finale when all four star in a show that they hope will save the general's lodge.

All of this seems rather incidental to the musical numbers showcased in the then-revolutionary widescreen process called VistaVision. The most relaxed of actors during this era, Bing Crosby plays Wallace with his natural lan, and he croons the classic title tune early on and leads the group sing of the same song at the end. In contrast, Danny Kaye plays Davis with his mercurial style intact, though compared to his other films of the period, he is relatively subdued here. With her smoky, silken vocal skills on display, Rosemary Clooney plays Betty, Wallace's love interest, with aplomb and complements Crosby easily on ""Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep)"". She also delivers a nice torchy Berlin tune with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"" despite some silly man-choreography.

I have to say the most impressive performer of the quartet is Vera-Ellen, a phenomenal dancer who was the equal of Astaire and Kelly at her peak. She makes even Kaye look good in their musical duets - ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" and the amusing Martha Graham riff, ""Choreography"". However, her best numbers are with dancer John Brascia - the elaborate ""Mandy"" number where her pliable, slender frame seems to be everywhere on the screen, and the brief rehearsal number, ""Abraham"", where she and Brascia snap, pop, clap, kick and swing with unerring military precision. It's worth noting that her singing is dubbed by vocalist Trudy Stevens, which is pointed out by Clooney on the less-than-informative audio commentary track in the DVD package. Much better is the 16-minute retrospective interview with Clooney where her natural sense of humor emerges.

There are other numbers worth mentioning in the movie - the duet, ""Sisters"", done first straight by the women and later by the men as a comedy routine in half-drag (Kaye steals this bit handily with his over-the-top clowning); the foursome on the vintage Berlin ""Snow"" and ""Gee, I Wish I was Back in the Army""; and of course, the title tune at the end. Way over on the sidelines, Dean Jagger lends his warm dignity to the role of the retired general, and Mary Wickes plays Emma the housekeeper in her typically sarcastic manner. Special mention needs to be given to Loyal Griggs's vibrant Technicolor cinematography, which makes the entire movie look appropriately like a bright red candy box, and the print transfer in the DVD almost fully captures the original visual quality. This is undemanding entertainment and a dependable holiday classic that feels like a favorite well-worn blanket.",1133827200,8,3805,5.0637958532695375
3801351,3,B001UHOWX8,"After hearing about the film for ages I finally watched the movie about 3 years ago and found it pretty boring.

The film doesn't have much of a story but stars an all star cast including Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney. Crosby and Kaye are song-and-dance men who hook up, romantically and professionally, with a ""sister"" act (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to put on a Big Show to benefit the struggling ski-resort lodge run by the beloved old retired general of their WWII Army outfit. Crosby is cool, Clooney is warm, Kaye is goofy, and Vera-Ellen is so so but dose great in the dance numbers. The film includes such songs as ""Sisters"" which is in the movie twice first with Clooney and Vera-Ellen singing and then Crosby and Kaye do their own halarious drag version, then there is the coll song ""Snow"" which I like alot  and the slow but memrable and cant get out of your head ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" and of course the clasic ""White Christmas"".

The movie itself is great and I love it because of the feelings it brings.  The story is kind of silly and trite and the songs don't advance the storyline.

It's a great old movie, with Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby starring as old army buddies who become successful in show business after World War II.  They meet the Haynes sisters, played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen, and end up going to Vermont with them for the holidays.  Bing and Rosemary fall in love, pushed together by the other two, while the four of them try to do something nice for a retired general who is now running the Vermont inn where they are staying.

The movie has some good music and dancing, a decent story and a lot of laughs.  It's one of two Christmas movies I have to watch every year (along with ""It's a Wonderful Life"").",1096588800,4,707,4.407692307692308

They all end up traveling together by train to Vermont where the sisters are performing for the christmas holiday at a ski resort.  When they arrive, they find no snow and very few customers, and the general that Crosby and Kaye served under.  Needless to say, they try to help out, and in doing so, they reawaken the spirit of christmas and giving in everyone.

3801366,4,B001UHOWX8,"Many people find WHITE CHRISTMAS to be a nostalgic trudge down memory lane.  But in truth, it's hard to think of a more prescient film, anticipating, as it did, problems that would not even have a name for another 25 or 30 years.  Yes, I'm talking about that infamous lack of snow in Vermont in 1954.  Decades before ""global warming"" became a buzz phrase, director Michael Curtiz, writers Krasa, Frank and Panama, along stars Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney and Danny Kaye were bravely tackling this hot issue with style, wit and aplomb.
OK, so I'm kidding, but not so much about the style and wit.  It's there in abundance (one can argue about the aplomb, though).  It's got it all, Crosby and Clooney singing, Kaye and Vera-Ellen dancing.  Great stuff.  Yes, the corn grows high in Vermont, or at least until that first snow hits.  Some complain about the rather calculated post-war military sentiment, and it is true that ""What Can You Do For A General"" is not exactly the film's high point.  Dean Jagger is solid though as the dignified general, and he and the perennial private Kaye play well off each other.
While both WHITE CHRISTMAS and the much earlier HOLIDAY INN were classic Bing Crosby vehicles, the former cannot really be said to be a re-make (in any sense) of the latter.  It was probably inevitable that Crosby would have to do the title song in some Technicolor vehicle or other, but an attempted remake of the Astaire/Crosby classic would probably not have been a good idea .  Both films the  show-biz revue in the New England inn theme, the buddy theme and the inevitable romantic complications with show biz gals who really just want to settle down.  But the Kaye/Crosby camaraderie angle plays sweeter than the Astaire/Crosby rivalry.  Was that a 50s thing?  Hard to say, although many point to that era as being more conservative than preceding decades had been.  It is at least interesting that the hint of show biz cynicism in HOLIDAY had been replaced by show biz warmth in the later film.  (Significantly,Rosie's mistrust of Bing's motives in helping the general are totally unfounded.  He's not a huckster, but is, true to form, just a decent guy who happens to be in show biz.)
WHITE CHRISTMAS is also a little more seasonally specific than HOLIDAY INN.  Crosby fans can justify dragging out the latter almost any old time of year, since one or the other of those holidays the inn was open for must be coming up.  WHITE CHRISTMAS will likely remain an annual seasonal favorite for most: although who's to say that a little WHITE CHRISTMAS in July would do a body any harm for that matter.",1073088000,2,2615,4.692982456140351
3801367,4,B001UHOWX8,"After watching this movie at least thirty times over some forty years (nearly every Christmas), it feels like I'm reviewing a member of the family. ""How do you rate your Aunt Vicky? Compare and contrast with other aunts and cousins.""

Since numerous reviewers have already summarized the plot nicely, I'll move right on. This is a loose reworking of Holiday Inn, which was actually a better movie. The musical and dance numbers were better in Holiday Inn, and the story was even a bit more interesting. But White Christmas is in bright, clear color, and they apparently had a bigger budget for sets, so it looks better than Holiday Inn.

I've always enjoyed the first half of the movie better. The story is simpler, the characters are sympathetic, and there is a more relaxed feel to it. The second half gets fairly maudlin before coming to an abrubt and happy conclusion. Once they take care of that troublesome general (What DO You Do With a General?), they can get back to the main plot of pairing up. After all, this is really a romance story, decked out in sleighbells and mistletoe.

So even though this movie is getting dated and creaky with age, we still have it to our house for Christmas every year, along with Aunt Vicky.",1072310400,7,1232,4.6422018348623855

I can't believe how many people have written cynical remarks regarding this film, all I can say to all of them is this- LIGHTEN UP! I read one review from someone who said they hated this movie because Bing Crosby was a child abuser. This is not true.

Like the title implies, SNOW! SNOW! SNOW! SNOW! on Christmas Day! I love to see SNOW on Christmas! The ending of the movie is not really surprizing, but a true delight! When General Waverly (DEAN JAGGER) is told by one his officers that it's snowing, he goes out the front door to see the creation of a winter wonderland in Pine Tree, Vermont! When I see this I start to cry! Then as the end of the movie comes, Bob Wallace (BING CROSBY) has the backdoor opened to reveal the winter spectacle to the crowd of soldiers and their families, who have gathered to give their formal general of WWII a most heartwarming memorable Christmas reunion ever! I cry all the harder! The songs of Irving Berlin are priceless. Next to WHITE CHRISTMAS, I throughly enjoy two other songs; SISTERS, SISTERS and COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS! But the true magic of WHITE CHRISTMAS, isn't just the music or the SNOW, but something that lies deep inside of all of us! When Wallace and Phil Davis (DANNY KAYE) tag along with the Hayne Sisters, Betty (ROSEMARY CLOONEY) and Judy (VERA MILES) and travel by train to an inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, they chance encounter the boys former general the landlord of the inn! With good intentions Wallace invites the whole crew from New York to come up and rehearse in Vermont, at quite an expensive price tag! All goes well until nosy housekeeper Emma (MARY WILKES), overhears part of a phone conversation between Wallace and producer Ed Harris, and spills the beans to Betty without getting the FACTS! (SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SHOOT EMMA! I WOULD NOT WANT ANY SNOOPER LISTENING ON MY VERY PERSONAL AND PRIVATE PHONE CONVERSATIONS! THAT'S TRESPASSING!!!!) Betty becomes infuriated with Bob, thinking he's pulling an ANGLE, heads for a new job at a N.Y. nightclub. To make matters worse Davis and Judy fake an engagement, thinking Betty wouldn't have to take care of Judy any more! (BOY! PEOPLE REALLY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT GETTING ALL THE FACTS FIRST!!!! STUPID EMMA!!!!) But only when she sees Bob making his pitch on TV and learning the FACTS that this is a special Christmas present, not a publicity stunt, she regrets her decision and returns to Vermont to help out with the show. Danny Kayes performance is a gem! Who else could play the simpleton grateful soldier who uses that old ""I SAVED YOUR LIFE-BUT YOU OWE ME A FAVOR ANYTIME (remember my broken arm) GIMMICK!!!!"" This is ROSEMARY CLOONEY'S, DANNY KAYES, and DEAN JAGGER'S greatest film ever! To see General Waverly dress in unform again makes your heart warm inside! Then the surprize revealed to him in the dinner theater brings tears to your eyes! And then the SNOW! WOW! WHITE CHRISTMAS is all this and much more! The music, the performances, all memorable! As for the SNOW, I live in Connecticut, in New England! And Vermont is here with us too! To me WHITE CHRISTMAS is New England at Christmastime! A time for joy, love, celebration and great faith!

3801370,5,B001UHOWX8,"Well, actually, it is not like the ones I used to know, because I wasn't alive when ""White Christmas"" was made.  But that doesn't stop the waves of nostalgia from coming over me every year when I watch this film.
Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen, Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney are each perfect in their roles, and make a nice balance of comedy, dancing, crooning and romance.  The storyline is a bit sweet, but no more so that egg nog, cookies, candy canes and everything else that makes Christmas great.  I want to sit next to that big open-hearth fire and pour a buttermilk for my lady.
The all-Irving Berlin soundtrack is great.  My favorite number, aside from White Christmas of course, is Choreography.  But they are all winners.
The DVD has a few nice extra features.  Rosemary Clooney gives a fond look back.  This is a DVD that is worth the money, as it gets at least a few plays every year.",1070323200,14,892,4.503105590062112
3801371,3,B001UHOWX8,"Ok, I saw this flick when it was first released. Since that time I CAN'T consider Christmas complete unless I watch this movie at least 2 or 3 times.  No, it's not the Greatest Movie Ever Made, but it's so darn enjoyable; director, cast, and crew just seem to do everything right.  I formerly preferred the VHS tape to the 2000 DVD release, tho today that tape is no longer playable; the DVD has slightly greyed color with (apparently) a bad yellow layer in the master negs. My DVD players have OK color controls that fix this (even though yellow is the worst color to try to correct with most consumer-grade equipment). But the DVD image has two other problems -- most scenes show an irritating flicker and some subtle vignetting in corners, with too much contrast overall that makes for glossy noses, shiny foreheads, and other glazing effects on highlights.  The DVD flicker and vignetting (it showed up on 3 players and 4 tv sets) are truly irritating, spoiling what is otherwise a very good 4-star movie and a good old-fashioned Christmas story.  If you have an above-average VHS player, stick with the remastered tape if you can. The DVD looks rather dim on HDTV, and S-video or composite hookups don't help (Looks worse on S-video) but these do generate a very sharp image. I tried 2 copies of this DVD, both had the same problems. The defects are slight; many viewers won't notice, but those who do seldom fail to comment. Be prepared to twiddle with your tv picture controls. The image doesn't stop this very pro cast from Paramount from doing a wonderful job with what is essentially 1950's fluff, but who cares?  Berlin's music is wonderful (""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"" has to be one of the more perfect Hollywood-musical songs ever written). Even Dean Jagger makes his predictable lines ring true. Crosby and Kaye are quite good together, and Rosemary proves that the old way of just singing a song with sincerity beats hysterical wailing any day. Perky Vera Lynn does some of her best footwork here. With the way Vera must have worked-out, how could she stay so spindly yet look so delicious (my wife wants to know). The production numbers are above-average for Paramount, perhaps due to director Curtiz' expert touch (he also gave us 'Robin Hood' in 1938 and 'Casablanca', among many, many other great hits).  Even if the ending stretches credulity beyond any semblance of reality, enjoy it anyway.",1069718400,10,2429,4.771428571428571
3801372,5,B001UHOWX8,"I am not going to waste one minute of anybody's time here doing a re-cap of the story line to this movie. If you grew up in the United States of America at any time over the last fifty years you know who Wallace & Davis are, you know who the Haynes Sisters are, and you know who General Waverly and his family are. You know where the Columbia Inn is, you know it has trouble paying its way financially because it is a winter resort that doesn't have any snow, and you know that Wallace & Davis are going to pull out all the stops to save the day. AND you know they WILL (...They ALWAYS do! Every Christmas!).
  You also know that the centerpiece song of this film was first written for, and performed in, another Bing Crosby film called ""Holiday Inn"" (an Inn that HAD snow), released twelve years earlier and took off in popularity during World War Two to ultimately become the single most popular song ever written (though Paul McCartney's ""Yesterday"" has long tried to ""edge"" it). You know also that this same song...and others from ""Holiday Inn"",got recycled AGAIN into another movie titled ""Blue Skies"" (Crosby & Astaire once more) that fell IN BETWEEN ""Holiday Inn"" and ""White Christmas"". But you also know that the old saw about ""Third Time's The Charm"" came true here big time. THIS Irving Berlin Christmas extravaganza is the one that really hits the home run right out of the ballpark.
  So, enough with what you know!!! Here's what yours truly knows. There are people out in this world who like to consider themselves ""cool"", and ""hip"", and ""with it"", and they like to snicker and smirk and revel in cynicism and sarcasm...believing these are the hallmarks of ""sophistication""...and such people tend to regard films with strong sentiment like ""White Christmas""as being ""cornball"" and ""sugary syrupy"" and ""cloying"".
Well guess what, people. THESE turkeys are the kinds of JERKS Wallace & Davis say the army makes ""thousand dollar jobs"" for.
They are emotional ignoramuses. The ""Soulfully Challenged"". Nobody needs their opinions. They can take their black clothes,
their tie-dyed hair, and their 847 body piercings, and TAKE A HIKE!If you POSSESS a heart and a soul, the end of this film is one of the most moving things you will ever see in your life. If you don't , then more's the pity for you. ""White Christmas"" is a gift in and of itself to each person who sees it, because not only does it make one's spirit soar to watch it, but it lays down an example for all of us. It says if you will unselfishly ""go that extra mile"" for someone else...not only at Christmas, but ANYTIME...then you can sometimes get a real-life spiritual payback that can send your heart right over the moon.

3801373,5,B001UHOWX8,"Back in 1954, director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962, who won the Oscar for Best Director for the 1942 film ""Casablanca"") directed a musical that has become a beloved Yuletide classic for many people (myself included): ""White Christmas"".  With the all-star cast of Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, Rosemary Clooney, Vera Ellen and Mary Wickes, the film is often regarded as an updated remake of the 1942 classic ""Holiday Inn"", which also starred Bing Crosby and featured the same classic Yuletide song, ""White Christmas"".  Though the two films do have many similarities (they're both musicals with lots of song and dance and they both have two main male characters), there are sufficient differences in their respective plots to make each film a unique viewing experience.
""White Christmas"" begins on a World War II battlefield with soldiers performing a Christmas show for their fellow soldiers.  The two starring soldiers are Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye).  During the performance, all of the soldiers in attendance pay homage to their commander, General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger).  The film then moves forward to its present day of 1954 where it finds Wallace & Davis as being very popular and successful on-stage song & dance performers.  After one of their performances, they go to a nightclub where they a performance by two beautiful sisters: Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy Haynes (Vera Ellen).  Bob & Phil become infatuated with the pair (Phil more than Bob).  They meet each other and Phil sneakily arranges for himself and Bob to go to Vermont, where the Haynes sisters are going, instead of their planned destination for their next performance.  Bob isn't too happy initially with Phil's subterfuge, but relents and enjoys the trip with the Haynes sisters to the Vermont ski lodge.  Sadly, when they arrive, there isn't any snow; but they quickly discover who owns the ski lodge: their former commander, the retired General Thomas F. Waverly, who is assisted by his daughter Anne Waverly (Anne Whitfield) and Emma Allen (Mary Wickes).  The unfortunate lack of snow isn't very good for the ski lodges business, but Bob & Phil decide to help the retired general in the best way that they know.
Songs by Irving Berlin in ""White Christmas"" include many wonderful and catchy tunes as listed below.  (Vera Ellen's singing was dubbed by Trudy Stevens.)
* ""The Old Man/Gee I Wish I Was Back In The Army"" (5 stars, performed by Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and chorus).
* ""Sisters"" (5+ stars, Rosemary Clooney, Trudy Stevens and chorus).
* ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" (4 stars, Danny Kaye with the Skylarks & chorus.)
* ""Snow"" (5+ stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, Rosemary Clooney, Trudy Stevens and chorus).
* ""Blue Skies/Mandy"" (4 stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and chorus.)
* ""Choreography"" (5 stars, Danny Kaye, the Skylarks & chorus.)
* ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"" (5 stars, Bing Crosby.)
* ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" (5 stars, Rosemary Clooney.)
* ""What Can You Do With The General"" (5+ stars, Bing Crosby.)
* ""White Christmas"" (5+ stars, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Trudy Stevens & chorus.)
""White Christmas"" has deservedly become an annual Yuletide classic that will be enjoyed by many generations to come.  Overall, I rate the film with 5 out of 5 stars.  Also on the DVD is an excellent commentary by Rosemary Clooney.  Sadly, ""White Christmas"" was Vera Ellen's second-to-last film after she decided to retire from acting.",1067385600,6,3506,5.020689655172414
3801374,5,B001UHOWX8,"Ok, I finally got tired of trying to find this film on some time when I can watch it! I grew up loving sweet Danny Kaye, and this film was my favorite as a young girl. It was made two years prior to my birth (aging myself aren't I?), but though the plot is corny, I still get a thrill when all the men stand for 'their general'. Bing Cosby and Rosemary Clooney were two of the most gorgeous voices for this type of stuff, and though I am deaf now, my memory fills in the gaps. So I am buying this beautiful movie, and introducing it to a newer generation who will love the ballerinas at the end, and maybe they will get as much joy from this movie as I have all my life.

3801375,4,B001UHOWX8,"Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) come together as a song and dance team after Phil saves the life of headliner Wallace on the battlefield on Christmas Eve.  Anything Phil wants, he can get from Bob by making reference to the arm he injured (a phantom injury to be sure) in the saving. Now, he just wants Bob to take things slower.  To that end, he is trying to get him to settle on a girl.
Enter the Haynes's sisters, Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen), one of whom forges a letter from their brother to Bob and Phil to come see their act and give some pointers as a favor to an old army buddy.  It appears that Judy and Phil may have orchestrated the whole thing - Phil to get Bob to settle down and Judy to get tips from the pros.  Now, Bob - though attracted to Betty - is a cynic and figures everyone's got an ulterior motive and is not surprised to find out the letter is a forgery.  Betty is, however, offended that he thinks the SHE is playing an angle. Later, she will be convinced that Bob is playing an angle at someone else's expense and the resolution of the conflict makes for a wonderful and classic romance story.
After getting the girls out of a jam, thanks to Phil, the foursome end up going to Vermont where they run into their old general running a ski resort. But there is no snow.  Bob & Phil come up with a plan to boost the old man's spirits.  There are two plot lines here - one the romance between Bob and Betty, and, two, the relationship between the general and his old troops.  It is maybe not a GREAT movie/musical but it certainly is good.  Songs include White Christmas (of course), Sisters,  The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing, Count Your Blessings,  and What Do You Do With a General.
The Clooney commentary is very interesting.  She points out a lot of things I would not have noticed and has a lot of funny stories about virtually every scene.  For instance, the drag scene where Crosby and Kaye are performing ""Sisters"" ... they had already made so many mistakes that they didn't think it would be used and just really cut up.  When she pointed it out, I saw things I hadn't seen before.",1066608000,37,2165,4.3399503722084365

I bought this movie because it's becoming difficult to find it on television during the holidays at a time when I'm able to watch it and on a channel I recieve on my TV.

""White Christmas"" is the annual holiday right-of-passage that follows the exploits of two G.I's , turned Broadway showman.  Together, they bring their latest hit to a quaint inn in Vermont and save it from going out of business.  The film stars Danny Kaye, Bing Crosby, Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney and is riddled with the kind of Christmas magic that one doesn't seem to get from later film fare based around holiday themes. No! This is not the first time the world heard the title tune.  That honor belongs to ""Holiday Inn"" a 1942 musical with Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby also from Paramount but available on DVD through  Universal studios.
Paramount has done a down right injustice to this movie on DVD.  Colors are not well balanced, shifting in range and consistancy from scene to scene.  Just watch the 'Sisters' number to see how Clooney's and Ellen's dresses shimmer from sky blue to aqua-marine. Some colors, like the red santa uniforms used for the final production number, are orangy red and bleach out the rest of the scene in a mess of undistinguishable browns, beiges and really, really soft greens. Also, a disturbing amount of pixelization and edge enhancement really give the film a hard edged look.  The soundtrack has been remixed to 5.1 but is strident, scratchy and poorly balanced.  There's a featurette which basically amounts to Rosemary Clooney (the only surviving cast member at that time)spouting off about how great everybody was and what a joy it was to be in the film.  Yeah, whatever!  A theatrical trailer comes with it. Big whoop!  What we need is a complete, frame by frame restoration to make this film come alive on DVD.

3801379,5,B001UHOWX8,"The story opens during WWII, as two soldiers are putting on a Christmas Eve show near enemy lines.  Flash forward a few years and the two soldiers (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye) are now successful Broadway entertainers.  They fall for a nightclub sister-act (Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen) and the foursome spend Christmas in Vermont at an inn that just happens to be owned by their beloved old colonel (Dean Jagger) who's down on his luck.

This wonderful musical is my favorite Christmas movie; it's sentimental and sweet and has four hugely talented stars.  The Irving Berlin songs are upbeat and lovely and, of course, the classic ""White Christmas"" tugs at your heart.  Bing plays the sensible, hard-working guy who funnyman Danny is always trying to marry off.  Rosemary is a sensitive singer and Vera-Ellen is a dazzling dancer.  They have such a good time together that viewers can't help but be carried away by the pure joy of it all.

This movie is firmly-rooted in the fifties, purely G-rated and many call it corny, but I love this kind of movie.  I can't count the number of times I've seen and yet it's never gotten old for me.  The actors are beautiful, the romance is innocent, and the happy-ever-after finale with everyone dressed in red and white amid gently falling snow is unforgettable.

3801380,5,B001UHOWX8,"This is pure entertainment. Like so many people here, I grew up to this movie. I usually put off seeing this movie until the last because it's so WARM, I like to end up the holiday with a high note.
The plot is fine, it's no ""A Christmas Carol,"" but it's breezy. Whoever questions Bing Crosby's talent doesn't realize that here he is at his prime, just doing what he does best, being relaxed, charming and in wonderful voice. And he is hilarious in this movie for his ""hipster"" dialogue: ""Grab the cow"" when he says to Rosemary Clooney when he wants her to pick up the milk. He talks about women as ""scatbacks"" and ""first sackers"" and in my 41 years I still have no idea what he's saying but I still find funny. When Danny Kaye brings up children to the Haines sisters in a leading way, I love the way Bing whispers, ""Pushing... pushing...""
I feel bad for Clooney. She has a somewhat thankless role as the B - I - T - - - H sister because she completely misinterprets what Bing's up to but she comes around. She's still gorgeous, sultry and worth chasing. And the way she does ""Love"" is drop-dead phenomenol, even though the New York dancers that surround her are, of course, the same ones who dance with Vera-Ellen at the inn.
Danny Kaye is great, a wonderful sidekick. And he's a great dancer, too!
Vera-Ellen is a dish, quite a capable actress and comedian. (I like the way she says guiltily, ""I'm not the kind of girl that throws herself at a man,"" to which Danny Kaye fecetiously replies, ""No one would think that."") Or watch the movie just to see how startlingly tiny her waistline is. But I am always annoyed by the way at the end Crosby and Clooney are passionately making out and all of a sudden Kaye says ""I'll join you"" just unconvincingly grabs her and kisses her, like, ""Oh, me too, it's part of the ending.""
Dean Jagger, a marvelous actor, has kind of a thanklesss role, too, playing a Sad Sack kind of figure. Yet he still delivers. In the movie, they worry about him becoming a pathetic figure but they kind of end up making him such with that song, ""What Do You Do With a General?"" (I still like the way Crosby does up on the end note of ""un-em-ployyyyed."" Can you tell I've seen THIS movie too much?) I like how they call him the Old Man even tho he and Crosby were about the same age.
It's fun, it's Christmas. Great great movie.",1040601600,4,2348,4.3144796380090495
3801381,5,B001UHOWX8,"After only seeing this movie twice, I had the catchy numbers Snow, Sisters, the Minstrel Number, Count Your Blessings, Choreography, and my favorite The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing stuck in my head for a week. Made in 1954, you no longer see the real dancing in movies, where the girls could dance in stiletos and still look beautiful and graceful at the same time. And the songs are filled with pure Christmas joy and love.
After saving Bob Wallace's (Bing Crosby) life, Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) teams up with the entertainer to form the team wallace and Davis. They woo crowds with their dance steps and catchy tunes. Soon they become a huge production, with shows filled with show girls and dancing guys.
One evening before leaving for New York before Christmas, Wallace and Davis stop by a club to see their old army buddy's sisters perform. Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy (Vera Ellen) Haynes are trying to make it big as well. Through some confussion and singing, the four end up going to Vermont together. They end up staying at the hotel of Bob and Phil's old army general.
I'm not going to give away what happens, but I do want to tell you this movie is worth watching. The dancing and singing is sensational, and the characters lovable. This is definitley a great Christmas classic. Oh and by the way, Rosemary Clooney just so happens to be George Clooney's aunt.",1040342400,3,1384,4.676229508196721
3801382,5,B001UHOWX8,"...or what your tastes in movies or TV usually are. I care even less about anyone's threshold for what some people call ""schmaltz"". This story of two World War II Army buddies (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) and their postwar show business career has been a Holiday tradition for half a century now, and shows no sign of fading in the forseeable future. Unlike a lot of musical extravaganzas, this one has a not-too-shabby plot. Crosby and Kaye are manipulated into auditioning a sister act (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) in Florida and end up in a more than professional relationship with the girls. So they wind up in Vermont at the next stop on the sisters' tour, at a struggling ski lodge owned and operated by their old general (Dean Jagger). It doesn't help the success of the Old Man's civilian business venture that there's been no snow in the area since Thanksgiving. Crosby's fine baritone shines as per usual, Kaye reminds us that his main talent was always dance, Clooney was in perhaps the finest voice in her career, and I'm suprised that dancer/ singer Vera-Ellen wasn't that well-known outside this film. I think this film was the stepping-stone for Jagger to his role as the principal in TV's ""Mr. Novak"". Anne Whitfield is adequately sweet-young-thing as the general's granddaughter Susan, much in the manner of Elinor Donahue in ""Father Knows Best"". We all know the signature tunes here. The title song, of course. The Clooney/ Vera-Ellen duet ""Sisters"", which also enjoyed radio success at the time. But a few other numbers here bear note as well. The Kaye/ Vera-Ellen dance number ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"". The pointedly satirical ""Choreography"", a telling shot at the artsy direction stage dance performance was taking at the time. The signature Clooney torch song ""Love You Didn't Do Right By Me"". With all that in the show, it isn't too diffucult to let the rather trite ""What Can You Do With a General"" skate a bit. As a movie fan, I'm into Trek, Bond, flicks of Tom Clancy origin. I'm bonkers about the new ""Lord Of the Ring"" trilogy. As a music fan, my main addiction is progressive, I've loved Miles and Brubeck since junior high, I have a certain nostalgia for blues metal trios like Grand Funk and Cream. But I feel that an appreciation for ""White Christmas"" transcends genre boundaries. Sure it's brazenly sentimental.

The ""Technical"" people who reviewed this seemed to enjoy picking it apart, but its content still shines thru! Bing singing WHITE CHRISTMAS in ANY forum is a JOY!His duets with Rosie are as smooth as honey and her presence there must've been the Sweetest gift to the general public in 1954! Though the film was originally scheduled to reunite Bing with Fred Astaire, Danny Kaye delights as his partner....
It is the first Christmas without Rosemary Clooney, indeed none of the principals are with us, yet thru this superb effort of Director Michael Curtiz, we are reminded that the joy of their personages STILL live, and make us smile inside!

3801385,5,B001UHOWX8,"This may seem like a long review but it is worth it if you are a fan of the film.
It is my decision not leave reviews for the same movie or product twice. In this case it may look like I have left 2 reviews for the movie WHITE CHRISTMAS (WC). This is not the case. In the past I left a review for the DVD version of WC and now I'm leaving it for the WC Collectors Edition (WCCE).
I already have the lp of WC but missed the opportunity to purchase it on cd. Good luck trying to find the soundtrack to WC it is in heavy demand.  Anyway I was searching for the cd soundtrack on a Ebay. Whenever I typed in ""WC"" I got pages and pages of results, too many to sort through. I did no better when typing ""WC cd"" in the search engine. Then I remembered that Peggy Lee sang in place of Rosemary Clooney on the soundtrack and I typed in ""WC and Peggy Lee"" and only a few items came up and one of them was the WCCE. At first this item looks like any other WC video offered up on the auction block. Nothing special. However, I wondered why the movie image popped up when I did a seach for Peggy Lee ,since she was not in the movie, and this is what I discovered.
Back in 1994 Paramount put together a 40th anniversary package for fans of the film. This package included a widescreen vhs version of the film with a couple of trailers for the film, a copy of Rosemary Clooney's actual script, an 8x10 glossy photo of the 4 film stars in one of the films ending dance sequences, a copy of the soundtrack cd that I had been looking for, and a booklet with photos from Rosemary Clooney of the film during production with comments. All this was packaged in an attrative white book. Written on the inside cover of the book is a one page letter from Rosemary Clooney detailing her thoughts on WC then and now.
The price I paid for this new unopened package was less than the price of some new cd's. I don't think the seller knew what they were selling and I don't think buyers who glaced at the picture knew what was being offered. I got the better end of the deal. This is an outstanding item for fans of the film. The booklet, with it's commentary hints at Rosemary's relationship with some of the cast members. I was startled to find that Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen were not that close, mostly due to Vera-Ellen and what is hinted at as her stand offish attitude. The script actually lists Donald O'Connor in the role of Phil Davis. Evidently Mr. O'Connor injured himself prior to the filming and that was when Danny Kaye took over the part.
Finally, WCCE is more than worth the price for real fans of the film. With Rosemary Clooney's passing earlier this year it is unlikely that a more complete editon of this film will ever be released as she was responsible for much of the background info in the WCCE and the DVD version. I just can't praise this edition enough. If you are a real fan of the movie you will want this item and may want to purchase it before Amazon.com runs out.",1039651200,,2970,4.1923076923076925
3801386,5,B001UHOWX8,"I work for Warner Bros., and I am well aware of the fastidious care that Paramount took with this  DVD re-mastering of White Christmas in 2000.  I am thrilled with the copy that I bought and think it looks fantastic considering the early era of Eastman color negative with which it was photographed. The luscious Technicolor saturations come through with flying colors. The remarkable VistaVision resolution translates very well to DVD.
Are there technologies in 2002 that can get rid of some of the subtle color fluctuations? yes there are..., and you can see it on Roman Holiday and Sunset Blvd., and most effectively on Singin' in the Rain, but the technology wasn't available in 2000.
Regardless, I think this DVD is a fabulous buy.",1039305600,4,736,4.88
3801387,5,B001UHOWX8,"White Christmas takes me back to those days when I was a kid. This film was shown almost every year. Irving Berlin's White Christmas, was about two army buddies who sang and danced for the troops of their squad. ""Bing Crosby"" was superb in honoring his world war two general with the rest of the boys from his army bunker. ""Danny Kaye"", was the jokester of the singing dual that helped with  setting up the general's ceremony. A touching film, full of emotions & fun; will leave u smiling and singing.

They draw in the crowds at the ski lodge in Vermont where the janitor there is the old Army general (Dean Jagger) that Bing and Danny knew. Within time, they gather up there old army pals and secretly prepare a show for General Waverly. It's quite a tearful moment when it happens.

3801389,4,B001UHOWX8,"Someone described the film as 'happy,' and it is just that! It could've been conceived any time of the year, but as it is, the story takes place ten years between two Christmases. A title card opens the story on Christmas Eve of 1944; it then passes through time, and settles into the current year of the film itself- 1954, after which it ends with a luminous Christmas Eve snowstorm. Do the math. BTW, while Bing Crosby is the star of this one as well as 'Holiday Inn,' I don't entirely understand how this is a remake of that. (No other holidays are mentioned in this film.) But it does have the late Rosemary Clooney (a siren of beauty and a joy to hear) playing nicely off Crosby, especially in the duet ""Count Your Blessings,"" as well as the ingenious Danny Kaye- particularly fine in the satirical ""Choreography"" and his glamorous, Astaire-like dance with Vera-Ellen to ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing."" Sadly, they only dance together once, but that inconsistency is probably due to the producers' earlier plan to have Fred Astaire (and then Donald O'Connor) in that role. The other numbers- ""The Army,"" ""Sisters (both versions),"" ""Snow,"" ""Mandy,"" and the title number- are all winning.",1038528000,4,1206,4.802884615384615
3801390,4,B001UHOWX8,"It is a very cute movie, but I have to admit that is is also very corny. Bing Crosby is great, as usual, but the plot is pretty drab. The songs are pretty awful, and the dancing is okay. All in all thuogh it is a very cute movie",1038182400,3,228,3.673469387755102

3801392,5,B001UHOWX8,"I watch this movie so much around the holidays that my eyeballs start to bleed around the middle of December. It's a happy, fun to watch movie, with lots of fab singing and dancing! (Talk about talent, actors like Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and the others, they not only had to act, they also had to sing and dance, and all here do each task wonderfully.)
There's also a lot of witty banter between Bing and Danny. In the dressing room, on the train,or anywhere, you can tell that these two men had an affection for each other and it's very charming.
Two wee, but particular things I've noticed after so many viewings: You get a ""brief"" glimpse of Bing's underwear, in the opening dressing room scene, when Danny and Bing are changing clothes after a show. There's a lot going on in this scene, clothes changing, shoe throwing, and some of that witty banter, but if you watch closely, Bing takes his pants off,and right there and for a few fleeting seconds, before he can pull his shirt tails down over his chubby mid-section, there they are. Nothing X-rated or anything, just you know, one of those things you see after you watch a beloved movie four thousand times.
There's also the coffee glitch, when the Haynes sisters are discussing their brother's letter, before performing for Danny and Bing. Skinny sister pours some coffee while talking to Rosemary Clooney about their brother who is out of the country, ""in Alaska"" and the camera shot of her changes to a close-up. I think she pours the same cup of coffee twice, but you can check it out for yourself!
I spent a great deal of this movie trying to figure out if Rosemary is heavy or if Skinny sister is just so wretchedly thin that everyone looks hefty when next to her!
But these are endearing aspects of the movie, the songs are classic and great and it's just as corny as you'd want a Christmas holiday musical to be! Where else can you hear Bing and Rosemary sing about insommnia and contemplate eating liverwurst sandwiches by a fire?
In the end, all find what they're looking for, and we get snow, sleighbells, children and the stars in Santa suits, who could ask for anyhing more?",1037664000,,2149,4.569948186528498

Great songs - not just 'White Christmas', but 'Count your blessings', 'Snow', and 'The best things happen while your dancing' to name a few.
Fantastic dancing - Vera Ellen...need I say more?  Beautiful and extremely talented...her partner in the 'shows sequences' is phenomenal as well, and Danny Kaye isn't exactly a slouch.
A fun, campy 1950's story - more engaging than that 'other' famous Christmas movie with Jimmy Stewart.
Clean humor - I'm not opposed to a little sex and violence now and then, but it is refreshing to see that it isn't a requirement in a movie.

Alright-the movie doesn't contain violence, nudity, cursing or hip-hop versions of Irving Berlin tunes-so if that's your preference for movie 'talent', then don't even think about watching a movie such as this-REMEMBER FOLKS-it's from 1954!  Anyway, since out here in the northeast we have had one of the hottest summers on record-I decided to think cool thoughts & put this movie on one sultry 95 degree evening.  I sat back & thoroughly enjoyed watching this again(my family alternates Christmas films every other year)& plan to put it on again over the Christmas holidays.  For anyone that claimed that Bing was just 'walking through' this film or that he wasn't as great as he was a decade or 2 before this was made-you couldn't be more wrong.  In fact, everyone connected with the film said that working with Bing was not only a pleasure but a helluva lot of fun as well.  I suppose I'll get mostly negative points for this review but I really could care less-I think I'll live.  Very highly recommended for fans of great Christmas movies as well as TRUE TALENT.",1029456000,4,1273,4.838709677419355
3801395,5,B001UHOWX8,"And it sure would be dandy.... if you'd put this in right now
So much for that tacky opening line. This is one of my favourite Christmas movies. I watch it over and over and never get tired of it. One of the reasons I like it is the fact that although it is a musical, the songs are not tiring or tedious, and there is enough of a real story - however minimal it may be - to hold it together between songs. Yes, it is lightweight fluff. But it's lightweight, not empty, and that's the difference.
I think the cast is brilliant, and the dialogue is a continous laugh - particularly the exchanges between Wallace and Davis. Always, always getting on each other and in such a funny way. That makes for lots of good quotes. Michael Curtiz doesn't play any games with shadows here as he does in Mildred Pierce, Casablanca, or even King Creole, but his direction is still all good.
Rosemary Clooney is very beautiful here as Betty, and has more depth than her superficial platinum-haired sister with the legs. Vera-Ellen (Judy) can dance - and act to a point - but Betty is better in my mind by a long way. Bob and Phil (Bing and Danny) are great also as I have already mentioned. Dean Jagger (the general) is fine, and the nosy housekeeper is one of those hilarious minor actors who liven up any movie with their presences...
The dance numbers and songs... ""Mandy"" is unique, interesting - but not a favourite. And the Choreography number is far from a stunner except for the first line... ""The theatre! the theatre! what's happened to the theatre?"" said as Danny Kaye says it.
Well, I think I have said enough. If you haven't seen this, you should. If you have seen it, you should see it again.",1028678400,5,1690,4.402555910543131

The performances cannot be bettered; Bing and Rosemary make a delightful singing screen couple; while Kaye and Vera-Ellen make the perfect matchmakers heckling on the sideline.  Mary Wickes (SISTER ACT, NOW VOYAGER) is hilarious as Jagger's busybody other half.

It's like so many others of its kind, but remains a perennial favorite because it's Christmas-themed and so it comes up every year.
Rather than detail more about the movie itself, which has been amply explored in many other of the customer reviews, I want to briefly discuss the features on this DVD.
First, there's a decent ""the-making-of"" type of documentary.
And then there's the audio commentary by the movie's ""leading lady"", Rosemary Clooney.
The latter is so awful it's almost worth hearing just to know how bad an audio commentary can get.
To the extent that Clooney actually says anything interesting about the movie, it was already said by her or others in the documentary.  The rest of her commentary consists of chuckling, interminable pauses, trite gossip, and cheering on the characters onscreen (e.g. ""Way to go, Vera!"").
So only get the DVD if the movie itself is what you want in your collection.  The extras don't amount to a hill of beans.",1010534400,7,1198,4.945273631840796
3801401,4,B001UHOWX8,"Irving Berlin's wonderful collection of songs find a well-suited home in the holiday classic ""White Christmas,"" a movie bursting with vibrant colors, a zesty, delightful cast, and a plot that bears nothing but sheer whimsy and comical brilliance from some of the all-time greats. Inevitable comparisons to ""Holiday Inn"" arose at the time the film was released, though there's no reason not to fall in love with this movie's warm and spirited appearance.
Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye star in the film as army buddies Bob Wallace and Phil Davis. When an attack commences on their campsite, Phil is injured while pulling Bob from danger, and wittily uses his injured arm as a way to convince Bob to join him in a singing duet, leading to their popularity as Wallace and Davis becomes a hit. After receiving a letter from an old army pal, they head to Florida to see the Haynes Sisters, composed of motherly Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and crafty Judy (Vera Ellen), who wants nothing more than to see her sister married and happy.
Finding that they have a common goal, Phil and Judy cook up a scheme that lands the four of them in Vermont, where the girls are to perform at a ski lodge that has been doing poorly due to lack of snowy weather. What's more, the owner of the lodge is none other than Phil and Bob's old army general, Thomas Waverly, whose financial situation is increasingly unstable because of the lackluster season. What do the boys do? Why, they cook up a plan to whip the general's self esteem back into shape, all the while falling in love with the sister act as they await the much-anticipated snowfall.
The story may not be as complex as past Christmas films, and even for a musical, though it's certainly never dull, thanks in part to some grandiose musical numbers and exuberant dance sequences. There's a great deal of schmaltz to be had with the romances between Phil and Judy and Bob and Betty, but it all goes down easy like an overly sweetened snow cone. Director Michael Curtiz is careful to keep the romance and the outside stories in equal measure, for a movie that's half sweet, half sweeter.
This snow cone is made easier to swallow by the acting on the parts of Kaye, Crosby, Clooney and Ellen, who each supply humor, wit, and tact into their characters. Kaye is the standout, employing his graceful way with comedy into Phil with incredible results. Dean Jagger makes the general more than just a secondary character, while Mary Wickes provides some lighthearted moments as the maid Emma.
The physical appearance of the movie is superbly mounted, a handsome displays of nicely-paced choreography, winsome costumes, and striking music and dance sequences. Irving Berlin's classic songs, from ""Sisters"" to ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" make their way into the story, some as entertainment pieces within the film, others as advancements of the romantic angles. The famed title song makes its appearance in the film's finale, which crowns the film in a glorious tapestry of costume and music. On a side note, this was the first film ever to be shot in what was known as VistaVision, a widescreen format that works well in capturing the film's various setpieces.
In the end, ""White Christmas"" is little more than a fairy tale spun from sheer whimsy, but its a striking example of a fairy tale done in all the right ways. The appeal and talent of its quartet of stars adds a much-needed charm to the material, as does the production design, bringing Christmas to life like never before. To watch the film with a cynical eye is to miss out on the magic and the joy this underrated classic has to offer.",1009324800,17,3632,4.730283911671925
3801402,5,B001UHOWX8,"This classic Christmas movie is a comfortable blend of music, romance, holiday sentiment, and humor.  Okay, so I have a keen grasp of the obvious.  Laying aside the sentiment, etc., I want to focus on the humor.  For me, this is the real appeal of annually viewing this film.  Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are among the funniest comedy teams.  Their snappy repartee rivals anything done by Groucho and Chico, Abbott and Costello, or even Hope and Crosby.  Under the deft direction of Michael Curtiz, the comedy sparkles.  Amidst the holiday schmaltz, zingers abound.  Why they didn't cast Bob Hope in Danny Kaye's part is puzzling (maybe it was the dancing), but it was a fortunate choice.  Early in the film, Danny's efforts to fix Bing up with a ""dumb Dora"" chorus girl gets the laughs going nicely.  Later, after Danny announces his fake engagement to Vera-Ellen, the same blond nuclear scientist nasally intones, ""Gee, I wish it would happen to me!""  Danny deadpans, ""So do I.""  The look that Bing gives Danny across the table as they contemplate a photograph of ""Freckle Face"" Haynes is priceless.  Great timing and delivery by an enthusiastic cast carry the film over the potential pitfalls of frequent and lengthy song-and-dance routines, and the unlikely plot premise of the ex-general's problems.  The lightweight story is merely a framework for the spirited singing and dancing.  The minstrel show number is great fun, and nobody sings ""White Christmas"" like Bing Crosby.  Multiple viewing only increases the enjoyment.  By the way, fiscally speaking, ""Wow"" falls between ""Ouch"" and ""Boiinnngggg!"" ;-)",1008288000,10,1609,5.057034220532319

3801405,5,B001UHOWX8,"The spirit of Christmas is alive and well in this delightful musical which features a number of songs, as well as an original score by Irving Berlin, entertainingly presented by the crooner, the comic, the singer and the dancer-- and not necessarily in that order.  It's ""White Christmas,"" directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen.  One of the most popular films of 1954, it opens and closes with the title song, while in between it's filled with one great musical number after another.  It's just after the Second World War; the popular General Waverly (Dean Jagger) has retired to run an inn in Vermont, while a couple of his men, Captain Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Private Phil Davis (Kaye) have gone on to fame and fortune in show biz.  During a Christmas break from their successful show in New York, Wallace and Davis follow an up-and-coming act known as ""The Haynes Sisters"" (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to Vermont, where they discover their former commander is in trouble; there hasn't been any snow this year, and no snow means no business at the inn for General Waverly.  But not to worry; with Wallace and Davis on hand, as well as the Haynes sisters, the General's problems are as good as solved.  It's just a matter of figuring out exactly how to go about it, which-- and, of course, it's not much of a surprise-- they do.  And along the way the audience is treated to some spirited and memorable production numbers.  They just don't make `em like this any more, and it's a shame.  Because this is pure entertainment, and one great show.
 Veteran director Curtiz, who directed his first film in 1912 in his native Hungary, consistently demonstrated his versatility again and again with films ranging from ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" ""Life With Father"" and ""Casablanca,"" to later fare such as ""King Creole"" in 1958 (which starred Elvis Presley).  And with this one he certainly proved that he knew his way around a musical.  Granted, it was hard to go wrong with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney and Vera-Ellen on board, but there's a big difference between delivering a finished product and making a great movie; and this one definitely falls into the latter category.  The story is solid, and Curtiz makes the most of the talent at his disposal.  Bing is at his best, and the antics of Danny Kaye are a joy to behold, as are the delightful song stylings of Rosemary Clooney.  But with all that talent on hand, the single element that truly takes this film to that higher plateau is the presence of the perky and winsome Vera-Ellen.
 Thought by many to be the best dancer ever to be a part of the studio system, Vera-Ellen is an absolute delight in this film.  Though she couldn't sing (her singing was dubbed by Trudy Stevens), what she could do on a dance floor more than made up for it.  Whether it's the ""Sisters"" number with Clooney, one with Danny Kaye or just with the guys in the chorus, she is mesmerizing to watch.  It may be a style that defines another era, but when she's dancing-- like Gene Kelley-- it's a timeless proposition and becomes entertainment that belongs to the ages.  It's just such a joy to watch someone like Vera-Ellen do what she does best.  It's transporting.  And when you consider that she is but a part of the equation here, it's easy to understand why this film remains so popular to this day.
 The wonderful Danny Kaye gives a terrific performance here, as well.  It may lack one of the tongue-twisting numbers he was famous for, but he still has ample opportunities to showcase his many and varied talents, which he most certainly does.  There was never any question that this was Bing's picture, but he couldn't have asked for a better second banana than the charismatic Kaye who, like Vera-Ellen, is virtually spellbinding when he's doing what he does best, which is just about anything he does in this film, whether it's singing, dancing, mugging or just throwing out a line to Crosby.
 Clooney's part may not be as flashy as those of her co-stars, but she sure can sell a song, and whether it's a solo or a duet with Bing or Vera-Ellen, there's no doubt that it's another of the many strengths of this film.  And she mixes well with the laid-back Bing who, though clearly the star of the show, demonstrates his generosity as an actor by always allowing and never begrudging his co-stars their time in the spotlight.  Crosby was a star and he knew it without having to prove anything; he also knew there was plenty of star dust to go around, and because he let it his movies (this one included) were all the better for it.
 The supporting cast includes Mary Wickes (Emma), John Brascia (Joe), Anne Whitfield (Susan), Richard Shannon (Adjutant), Grady Sutton (General's guest), Herb Vigran (Novello), Johnny Grant (Ed Harrison) and Percy Herbert (Train Conductor).  Thoroughly entertaining in the truest sense of the word, ""White Christmas"" is an engaging, enduring and uplifting film that will whisk you away to a magic place in your heart and in your mind.  It's so refreshing to take this journey to a time that may not have in reality been any easier, but at least seemed simpler and somehow less convoluted than our present era of ""political correctness.""  A time in which films like this one were not only able to be made, but were subsequently welcomed and embraced by audiences everywhere.  Today, we have ""Harry Potter,"" a new kind of magic and a great film in it's own right; but there will always be a place for Bing and his bunch, because theirs was a magic all their own, the kind that's lasting and immortal.  And it's all a part of the magic of the movies.",1006646400,2,5658,4.664652567975831

It's technicolor a it's best with a cast of memorable and funny characters and a soundtrack like no other! This film is the perfect follow-up to Berlin's previous hit, Holiday Inn. So curl up in a warm and cozy quilt, relax, and enjoy a look back into the heart-warming holidays of the musical 1950's in Berlin's WHITE CHRISTMAS!",999734400,2,672,4.516393442622951

3801410,4,B001UHOWX8,"The array of talent in this film is so outstanding that to describe the gifts of Bing, Danny, Rosemary, and Vera-Ellen would seem practically overkill. The musical numbers around which this show is based are perfectly delightful - brilliantly executed and ranging from the delightfully silly (Sisters) to the sentimental (Count Your Blessings) to Broadway show-stoppers.
This film has no literary value - one would search in vain for theme, plot, characterisation, or depiction of relationships. The ""climax,"" in which the World War II veterans are re-united to pay the surprise tribute to the Old Man, is so unrealistic as to be silly. It is purely a musical entertainment.
It's quite delightful - a relaxing interlude during any time of holiday stress. This is the perfect gift, in particular, for senior citizen relatives... but make sure it is not yet on their shelves, because it very likely is.",998006400,3,900,5.087837837837838
3801411,5,B001UHOWX8,"What ""White Christmas"" lacks in plot excitement, it makes up for in great dialogue, pretty little songs, and the adorable goofiness of our dear Danny Kaye.  He and Bing Crosby are old army buddies who have evolved into a wildly popular song-and-dance team.  When Phil Davis (Kaye) attempts to romantically entangle Bob Wallace (Crosby) with one of the singing and dancing Haines sisters they meet in Florida (Betty, specifically), he carts all four off to a cozy little inn located in Vermont.  (The sisters were booked to do their show there.)  Seems the inn has fallen on hard times due to the lack of snow in Vermont that year.  Guess who owns the hotel?  Phil and Bob's old general from army days!
Bob decides he has to do something to dredge up business for old General Waverley.  He, Phil, and the Haines sisters bring the entire casts of their respective shows to perform at the inn and hopefully draw in crowds.  Meanwhile, Betty Haines' sister Judy (Vera-Ellen) is conspiring with Phil to make Bob and Betty (Rosemary Clooney) fall in love.  But fate is heartless, and even as Bob gets a great idea to cheer the ol' General up, Betty misunderstands his plans and gets upset, thinking he is conspiring to commercialize on General Waverley's hard luck for the benefit of ""The Wallace and Davis Show"". (Note: the scene where Judy tries to convince Phil to set up a phony marriage engagement with her is not to be missed.  How can Danny Kaye make his voice crack like that?!)
Eventually things work out to the benefit of all, but not before Kaye's had the chance to come out with such tongue twisters as ""When what's left of you gets around to what's left to be gotten, what's left to be gotten won't be worth getting, whatever you've got left,"" and such classic lines as ""you're happy for the wrong reasons, and that's the same as being lonely and miserable, except it's WORSE.""
Don't miss Kaye and company performing the satire ""Choreography"", making fun of modern dance.  Actually, come to think of it, don't miss ANY of this masterpeice!  BUY IT NOW!",997142400,2,2059,4.673130193905817
3801412,5,B001UHOWX8,"I don't know what it is about this film but it stands alone as the best Christmas film of all time and it will probably never be toppled from it's throne.  Although a couple of the dance scenes are a little lengthy, it still carries the viewer along in a way that is delightful and entertaining.  Studded with stars, the most brilliant is Rosemary Clooney. She carries the film in every way. She is as talented as she is beautiful. I was 47 years old before I ever saw this movie and as far as I'm concerned I wasted 47 years of my life!  Start showing this classic to your children at an early age.

It's got a sappy old General, the most popular American song of the 1950s, a glamorous snowy finale, and, best of all, Rosemary Cloony.  Her voice is more cloying here than on her jazzier recordings, but still has that sexy turn to it.

3801414,5,B001UHOWX8,"The person who described this movie as ""Attrocious""in his review probably listens to (c)rap ""music"" also. However I agree with Leonard Maltin when he stated in his review that the subject movie is not half as good as the ""original"" Holiday Inn. In that regard I submit my comments about Holiday Inn (which I taped in December,1980 on Beta"") and as I entered this description in my personal catalogue, viz:
Cassette No. 30, Dec. 1980. Holiday Inn (1942) Features the wonderful music and lyrics by the great Irving Berlin, including the premiere of ""White Christmas"" sung (naturally) by Bing Crosby (aided by Marjorie Reynolds). As usual, Fred Astaire is marvellous and the rest of the cast, Virginia Dale, Walter Abel and Irving Bacon give full value for their fees. This movie is much better than ""White Christmas"" but suffers because it was filmed in ""glorious"" black and white. ASIDE: Fred Astaire, after auditioning in his very early years was summarized by his auditioner as follows: Dancer,balding,sings a little not much of a future.",993254400,,1039,5.011560693641618
3801415,5,B001UHOWX8,"I've loved this movie since I first saw it when I was 10 years old.  Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are two of the greatest actors that ever lived!

My sister and I are looking for it for a variety show that we're doing for our church.)  But seriously, it's one of the greatest Christmas musicals I've ever seen!

All this movie is, is a fluff peice.  They sing, they dance, they feel happy and then they go back to singing again...round and round we go...and where are we going? where is this movie taking us? NOWHERE!  Correct me if I'm wrong-which I'm not-but isn't a story supposed to have conflict!?  Isn't that one of the BASIC components to a good story?-Or ANY story, really?  Why Yes! I believe it is! Does this movie have conflict? No, I believe it doesn't!...well, okay...ONE IOTA of conflict is all it has, and the conflict lasted only 10 minutes or so.  That is it!  No other conflict in this whole feature length film.  I swear, I think this film was only meant to showcase the singing and dancing talents of Bing Crosby and company.  There is even a number in here that has NOTHING to do Christmas-and there is very little of anything to do with Christmas in this movie now that I think about it.
If you want to ONLY smile and feel happy as you watch happy people sing and dance then get this movie.  Otherwise, don't bother yourself.  The singing and dancing talent is very good, I will give it that...but trust me, that's ALL this movie has.",985132800,12,1326,4.43801652892562
3801417,5,B001UHOWX8,"I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old back in 1977 on a black and white tv.  Even as a kid I appreciated the fun story and catchy songs.  Years went by and as a  teenager I would look for this film every Christmas time.  It was never played, why I don't know, and as time went by I thought I had forgotten the name of the movie.  As a result my trying to view this film I became introduced to other Christmas classics such as Holiday Inn and Christmas in Connecticut which had similar summaries in the tv guide.

When I finally saw this film again it was 1986 and because I had not seen the film in almost a decade I though that the film had been colorized.  The colors were so bright and festive that I thought Ted Turner had colorized this film.  It was at this time he was destroying some films such as Miracle on 34th Street and The Maltese Falcon with this process.  However,  I noticed that this films color was better than any thing Turner had done.  I then learned that this movie was filmed in color and the first film to use the widescreen VistaVision format.  I had just recently purchased the lp of this film and was familiar with all the songs but when the songs are integrated with such fine actors as Crosby, Kaye, Clooney and Ellen and along with a simple but good romantic story I couldn't believe how much I could enjoy a holiday movie.  I also taped the film and later purchased the VHS version.

 I had been awaiting the DVD release but after reading other reviews about the poor quality of the color I put off buying it.  However, I bought it because of the commentary by Clooney and her interview.  I was not disappointed.  She actually seemed to be having fun recalling memories while commenting on the film.  Clooney made this DVD worth the purchase price.  Although I must agree with the other viewers, the color is horrible.  The version I taped off of tv had better color.  The color in this movie has been muted to the point where the film looses some of it's festive feel.  I do have a question that if anyone knows the answer to I would appreciate an e-mail with that answer.  ""Why does Peggy Lee sing the songs on the lp album with Crosby and Kaye instead of Clooney?""",979430400,2,2207,4.27536231884058
3801418,3,B001UHOWX8,"I love this movie. It's an outstanding film and a shmaltsy Christmas tradition. I only wish someone who cared about the movie could have been involved in the production of the DVD. Paramount must have used a fifty year old projector with a 3-watt bulb for this one. The color fluctuates continuously, as though someone was playing with the brightness. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but it's such a shame to let a flawed transfer like this out for such a fine movie.  The ""making of"" documentary with Rosemary Clooney was excellent. In fact, the movie clips in the documentary look infinitely superior to the body of the DVD itself. Paramount should hang it's head in shame at producing a DVD with such a low-quality image - and they're charging more than your average DVD as well! The audacity astounds me! I can only hope they recall this mess and re-transfer the film. Would I buy this, knowing what I know now? No, I don't think so. I'd wait to see if they re-release it.

3801419,5,B001UHOWX8,"I remember the first time seeing ""White Christmas"" at my Aunt Helen and Uncle George's house on Goals Road. They lived in the country,and it was snowing,and Christmas was two days away. What a great film to welcome the coming holiday. The funniest part is when Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye are in drag doing the ""Sisters"" number. I read that Danny started to ablive,and when he was hitting Bing with the feather,Bing started to break up,so they reshot the scene,but kept the original one. I'm so glad they did. The only Actor that couldn't sing was Vera Ellen. They used another singer for her numbers,but Vera could sure dance. Rosemary Clooney is the only living cast member,and still tours the USA with her band. Irving Berlin songs are fantastic.""Snow,Will Follow the old Man,""and my favorite,""Count your Blessings."" I loved Bing Crosby's voice,and Danny Kaye had a Unique style of dancing.

3801420,5,B001UHOWX8,"""White Christmas"" is a classic - corny, sentimental, predictable and absolutely WONDERFUL. The music, by Irving Berlin, is exceptional with the Bing Crosby version of ""White Christmas"" the ultimate! Rosemary Cloony, one of the best femal vocalists ever, is beautiful and has the great ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" in the super sexy black gown. Was there ever a better film dancer that Vera Ellen? I doubt it. (I had the pleasure of meeting her years ago and she was a warm, delightful person.)
Now the DVD version. It just makes this holiday delight even better. There is a wonderful interview with Rosemary Cloony that makes the DVD very special, but to top that there is her commentary track to be played with the actual film. Her recollections of things that happened during the filming are funny and delightful. At one point, she tells how Bing was breaking up during the filming of the song ""Sisters"" when he and Danny Kaye take over for the girls. He never thought that take would be used, but when the director compared that version with the more serious one, he chose the one with Bing breaking up.

These movies helped give me an idea of what glamour and drama were  back in the turbulent 60's.  I think White Christmas is a great movie  because it combines many of the elements that make a good movie.  It has  two love stories, not just one with Kaye and Crosby.  Also, they play off  of each other wonderfully.  Rosemary Clooney sang and did a spectacular  job.  There are fun song in this movie such as (Snow), and (Gee, I Wish I  Was Back in the Army) that I have never been able to forget.

Not because it's real, but because we want it to be.  Not because it's action-packed, but because it's simply wonderful. The  characters are lovable and their talent is undeniable.  It is what it was  designed to be: a charming movie with outstanding musical talent performed  and showcased.  I love it for all that it is AND for all that it isn't.  We  don't make 'em like that anymore and it's a shame we can't enjoy that kind  of innocence more.",941932800,5,621,4.222222222222222
3801433,5,B001UHOWX8,"I admit it....I watch this movie years round. YES! Even in July. It is such an up lifting movie with great lines, songs, and acting. And who thought you would ever see Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby in drag??!!!! A MUST  SEE any time of the year.",933724800,,242,4.148936170212766
3801434,5,B001UHOWX8,"The critics are wrong.  How can a film featuring the world's most talented individuals be anything but wonderful.  Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby light up the screen every available instant and Danny Kaye is fabulous.  As  a 19-year-old who loves movies, I can't name a movie that has touched my  heart, or introduces the Christmas season better than White Christmas.  Watch it with the whole family!!",924480000,,403,5.03030303030303
3801435,5,B001UHOWX8,"For some reasons the ""Critics"" don't like this film but that's understandable.  They usually don't have clue.  Believe me this is a fabulous movie.  Don't try to take it seriously, it's just fun.  You can  tell the cast was having a blast filming it.  You should have one watching  it.  If you're a Bing fan then you'll love this movie.",914976000,,336,4.483333333333333
