8128218,5,B000G11DAO,You have to respect John. He was a pioneer. After viewing this I do understand the use of the round pen as never before. Great training aid. Too bad most of his stuff is out of circulation. He is still current in training methods as far as I am concerned.,1414022400,,255,4.12
8128219,5,B000G11DAO,I was glad to find this tape. I'd lost the one I had for years.  John Lyons is the best for horse training and I've seen most of them.,1362182400,,134,3.6206896551724137
8128220,5,B000G11DAO,"I met Mr. Lyons many years ago when I was a young girl. Watching his Symposium, I was able to help several friends with their hard to catch horses.  Even in these days with all of the Johnny Come Lately ""Natural"" horsemen, I still find myself falling back to using Round Pen Reasoning with almost every horse I work with. It is old school and it works!!  No halters, no 'sticks' no gimmick tools to buy.  Just a lariat and a round pen and your patience!",1348012800,,453,4.244186046511628
