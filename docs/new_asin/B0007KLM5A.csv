8557527,2,B0007KLM5A,"I was looking forward seeing this dvd on working with leather, but I was greatly dissapointed when I did. I found very little that I liked about it, mostly because I had expected to learn how to make real leather bags and trunks. But the ones that she makes on this dvd is only made to look like the real thing - and that was not what I was looking for. I found this dvd not worth the money, sorry. This is my opinion anyway. The dvd on how to electify your doll house was great and if you are about to make your own doll house, I can recommend that one.",1284076800,,554,3.955357142857143
