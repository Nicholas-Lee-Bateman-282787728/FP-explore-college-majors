8336096,5,B001QOGY90,"Mikael Hafstrom's SHANGHAI is about to come out on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc and what a film it is. Set in Shanghai during the second world war with Japan having taken over most of China John Cusack as an American agent arrives in the port in search of his best buddy who was living in Shanghai and working for the US Government and has turned up missing. It does not take Cusack long to learn his whereabouts and to go after his buddy's asian girlfriend to learn more about him. Filled with spies, terrorism, counter terrorism and grit this 105 minute film races you forward as Cusack's character comes up against the Japanese troops already there and the resistance fighters set to try and topple them or die.

Chow Yun Fat plays a wealthy Shanghai merchant and Gong Li his wife. Ken Watanabe of Last Samurai fame plays the Japanese officer in charge of the port and in this film you are never very sure who is an ally of whom or who is spying on whom, how many double agents there are, and what everyone is set to gain as the real time history goes along toward the American/Chinese/Japanese clash that we know is coming and maybe is already here.

Set mostly at night the film glimmers with action, fantastic locales, beautiful women, and intrigue. Assassinations are the order of the day (or is that night) and Cusack manages to save lives as he hears of those dying around him, those tortured, those defenseless left to rot in a jail cell ... well .. you get the drift. Gong Li (in what I consider her best role yet) constantly veers from one man to the other never letting us know firmly in whose camp she is really in. Cusack falls for her at once, but we are left on the edge of our seats never quite sure if that is the one woman he should be falling for or not. Speaking of women we have the Nazi official's aryan wife who tries to bed Cusack, the Japanese lover of both the Japanese officer and Cusack's missing friend, show ladies and dance hall girls who are working both sides just to stay alive, and then Ms. Li who loves her Chinese husband, but is finally attracted to Cusack, and the Japanese officer all at the same time. Is she really pitting each man against each other? Does she really head up the Chinese resistance? Make sure when you purchase your copy of this amazingly excellent film that you turn on the ""english"" subtitles so you know what she is whispering in these men's ears in her native tongue.

Dark, adventurous, nail biting, spectacular I will not ruin it further by saying any more, but make sure you land yourself a copy of this film and enjoy it. You will not be disappointed, but you may be left just glancing every now and then over your shoulder in the darkness.",1291420800,7,2701,4.408817635270541
