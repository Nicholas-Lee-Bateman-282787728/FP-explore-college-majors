1989661,1,B0001DA0I8,"This is horrible.  The original concert I saw on HBO was very good.  This is a foreign very poor dubbing.  I doubt seriously it is legal to sell it in the USA.  The picture quality and the audio quality are extremely poor do not purchase this concert I sure wish I had not wasted my money on it.

It certainly did not even deserve one star.",1311379200,,340,4.090909090909091
1989662,5,B0001DA0I8,It turned out to be a lot more than I expected. It has great live performances of Dolly and Kenny seperately and together. We also have very nice extracts of both practising together.,1296950400,,183,4.575757575757576
1989663,4,B0001DA0I8,"I have this basic performance on VHS tape, and wanted to preserve it on DVD.  It's an interesting and entertaining look at the interaction between these two country (and sometimes cross-over)Super Stars.",1264809600,2,203,5.34375
1989664,5,B0001DA0I8,"A real enjoyable music DVD.They sing their hit songs both in solos and duets and do a tremendous job as only that pair can. It's a fun show and makes you feel good when its finished. They sing over 15 songs plus a medeldy and end with Islands In The Stream. All round good entertainment.

1989674,5,B0001DA0I8,"This DVD has to be the very best of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. It is of a concert of their ""Real Love"" tour together and the chemistry between them is electric. It has beautiful singing, comedy galore and shows wonderful entertaining little clips of behind the scenes on the tour.  If you love Kenny & Dolly and only get the chance to buy one DVD of either of them, make this the one. If you happen to be a little bit down, put it on.  I guarantee within 5 minutes you will be smiling.  It has the power to change you from a grouch to being on top of the world!!! Excellent!!!",1315526400,4,580,4.115044247787611
1989675,5,B0001DA0I8,"After Dolly and Kenny Rogers recorded their mega-hit ""Islands in the Stream"" in 1983 it was decided they would star in a Christmas special that aired on CBS in December, 1984 called ""A Christmas To Remember"". The album the special came from sold in the millions and the special itself was a huge ratings bonanza so the two decided to go on a world tour during much of the mid eighties to early nineties.

 This DVD called ""Real Love"" shows the wonderful chemistry both performers have with one another. Although an import from Asia, the disc plays on all DVD's and the clarity is excellent. We see both Dolly and Kenny performing their own solo hits, and at the end the two are joined together on stage for some amazing duet work including ""Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight"", ""We've Got Tonight"", and ""Islands in the Stream"".

 There is also some behind-the-scenes clips of the two working in the studio.

 This special originally aired on HBO in February, 1985 which coincided with Dolly's release of her RCA album, ""Real Love"" that also served as the title for their follow-up duet of the same name.",1313193600,5,1096,4.652849740932642

8010217,5,B0001DA0I8,This DVD is worth buying. Especially if you like Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton. I saw this concert in Dallas Live in 1985. It was my first concert & I was 14 years old. I've been a Dolly Parton fan since 1977. I'm 44 years old now. But Dolly is still my favorite singer. I was glad to find this concert on DVD. I use to have it on VHS. My only complaint is that they didn't show the entire show. It just has highlights from the show. Kenny & Dolly had great chemistry together. I'm hoping someday they will release the entire show on Blu Ray. Trust me Dolly & Kenny fans want to see & own it.,1461542400,2,590,3.966386554621849
8010218,5,B0001DA0I8,"These were two of the best singers the early 80's had, just by hearing their names on this concert, it's a winner! A total must have for everyone who enjoys country music and pop as well, highly recommended.",1460937600,,207,4.473684210526316
