8346810,4,B001VYO7EE,"Because of the wallstreet greed that most of your big to small distributers of classic film ,both local and foreign, many intresting classic films arn't being distributed cause they would make greedy companies profit in the long run, These companies don't cater to the fans of serious classic films. We are a large minority group, not the large majority of casual viewers who will only look at classics recomended by Authoritie. We are anti authoritie . We make are own decisions. Like the swing kids did. So as a result no one ever hears Tinos Rosi or Luis Mariano or Marika Rokk. Just Martine Carol or Jean Paul Belmando brigette Bardot. Recentley no german film actor or directors to the larger target of between 33 and 45 except for us serious classic film fans. That large target it's usually half thats intrest in the german film classics of 33 and 45 but only the direct propaganda only not the hollywood side. The other are politically correct ,backstabing conservatives. Well. We serious fans have to buy expensive dvd players to be able to get the foreign classics we want to see that the greedy big corpcatters won't distribute in the united states. We have to learn some foereign words too to understand when we buy at an internaitonal website. If amazon.com sells it good cause the advertisement is english. This isn't marcel pagnols best classic but it's good. It was his only feautre shot in color. It wasn't france's first talking feature in color. There first talking feaute in color was in 1946 in Agfa color from the austrian plant geva. Why didn't pagnole use that process. He used a process that was primitve addtive process Rouxe color system. By 1948 such a process was too impractical. Single strip color was slowly developing. This was Tino Rossi's first feature in color. He was the bing Crosby of France. Possibly after his work prohibiton was up. Unfortunatley he collaborated with the nazis .He would do some more movies but he began to conscentrate on his singing only. This is a low budget story of Franz schubert . The famous composer of Ave Maria. He decide to take a break from his teaching and composing and takes a hike. He meets a milliner and falls in love with his daughter. He sings almost throughout his picture. The daughter is played by pagnoles wife, The front cover is just a publicity shot cause in the film they go for the braided style. This is a good film . May be not the best of pagnole . But it's worth the collection",1270512000,,2469,4.6521739130434785
