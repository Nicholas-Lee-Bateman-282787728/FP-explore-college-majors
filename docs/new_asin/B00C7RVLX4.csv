5696613,5,B00C7RVLX4,"Synopsis:
A superhero team of brothers fighting against spiritual wickedness and evil, armed with faith lasers (not guns) special martial arts skills, and the power of the Holy Bible, these young boys display courage in the midst of battle while delivering their friends and community from dangers that range from the terrible Evil Bots to the bully on the street corner. And while they did it, they also help teach about literacy, math, and science skills along the way. This action-packed animated series is full of faith-based adventure, drama, and fun for kids of all ages.

Dove Worldview:
This is a terrific animated series with the Boys of Valor bringing their ""old time religion"" to a contemporary audience, complete with faith laser battles and high energy. The boys, Jerry the oldest, Calvin, Samuel, Daniel, Timothy, Micah and David, battle dark-faced evil spirits and also red and yellow faced enemies. They use faith laser swords and martial arts moves including punching and kicking. They know how to knock down the demons with spiritual warfare!
This is a unique four-disc DVD set which features the following episodes: Disc One: ""The Spirit of Division"", a short called ""Anger"" and ""Physical Science""; Disc Two: ""Mr. Gun Control"", ""Full Throttle"" and ""Alphabet""; Disc Three: ""The Thankful Heart"", a short called ""Maurice and the Snowball"", a short called ""Ninja Vanish"" and a short called ""Multiplication"" and ""On the Couch"". Finally, Disc Four: ""Captain Doubt"", an ""Inside Look"" with a character, David a.k.a. ""Maurice"" and a short called ""Positive Faith.""

This is a terrific series which kids will love and it focuses on spiritual warfare. As the demons set out to pit people against each other and to focus on mind games, the Boys of Valor fight with the Word of God and their swords of faith and they do great harm to these demonic forces. There is nothing frightening or over the top and we believe this is a solid series, imaginative, and worth viewing. It deals with various issues including one featuring a kid that is angry because his parents do drugs and he feels forsaken. This is the only element that might be a bit much for younger children but they will relate well to everything else in this series. With an emphasis on keeping a thankful heart, unity with others, and a focus on God, we are pleased to award this fantastic DVD set our Dove ""Family-Approved"" Seal for all ages. This would make a great Sunday school or kid's class tool for spirtual warfare lessons.",1367280000,5,2499,4.905437352245863

5696645,5,B00C7RVLX4,10/10 good movie great movie. Loading screens remind me of the good old days of vidya games. Purchase at least 3 copies because your bound to burn through the first two from watching it so much,1441670400,3,193,4.388888888888889

5696649,1,B00C7RVLX4,"This is a movie, with loading screens.

The 3D animations in this movie reminds me of The Hobbit trilogy, not flawless.

The purpose of this movie is to spread the word of christianity, though I'm now even more firm in my atheist way.

Storywise, it's about a group of black kids fighting japanese mechas, because someone thought that would be cool.

[Loading screen]

The main mecha boss was finished off by the worst dancing move I've ever seen, which completely failed to snatch viewers from Glee.

All in all I've rated this movie 1/5 Cheese doodles with the motivation that film is quite horrible.
Also it's kinda racist, just because you're black doesn't mean you walk around with a katana in your pocket just in case you happen to run across mechas from Japan, now that I think about it, that's kinda racist against japanese people as well.",1441584000,14,847,4.6891891891891895
5696650,1,B00C7RVLX4,"Just more Christians using their religion to scam people out of their money. If you're a Christian do not buy this because it's not helping your religion in anyway, just making you look like fools. The voice acting is terrible, you can tell it was recorded with different microphones. Sound effects are very rarely heard, and they don't match the situation at all. The animation is god awful, with the characters clipping into each other as if they're really ghosts. What is the point of putting a loading screen in a video?",1441584000,8,524,4.706521739130435
5696651,1,B00C7RVLX4,"A zero budget animated ""series"" done with no talent or effort in order to make a quick buck.  Nobody will be entertained by these discs, child or adult.  They are completely counting on having suckering people in with a supposed ""religious"" theme (though even there they fail as one of the messages the series espouses is ""If I dance for God, he will solve my problems for me"") and by posting their own fake positive reviews on every web site they can.  Do not buy these discs, do not rent these discs, do not watch these discs.",1409356800,23,528,4.422680412371134
5696652,2,B00C7RVLX4,Quality of graphics had plenty of room for improvement.  Great heart and the intent of the message in each video is commendable in this age that tends to fill kids with Godless messages and senseless violence.  Thank you for that.  Improve the graphics and flow of the scenes for next time.,1397779200,5,290,4.647058823529412
5696653,1,B00C7RVLX4,"Don't by this series, the animations is very amateur.  My son didn't want to watch it past five minutes.  I wasn't interested and neither was my son.  I am demanding the store I bought it from to take it back and shaming them for even allow this to be for sale.  Save your money or stick with VeggieTales.",1374883200,13,305,4.206896551724138

8578388,4,B00C7RVLX4,"I love this thing. They fail at their own religious messages, the animation looks like it was done on the budget of a sandwich, and the voice ""acting"" is absolutely hilarious on how bad it is. I know it's trying to be serious but it has me dying from laughter. I can barely write this review with a straight face.",1511049600,,313,4.233333333333333

8578392,1,B00C7RVLX4,"I feel dirty for even giving this product a one star. It deserves negative. Actually, it doesn't even deserve attention. The animation is disgusting and insulting to whoever watches it. The ""characters"" clip through their own bodies multiple times, and in one scene, these so-called Boys of Valor actually do a hip-hop type dance for the Lord to banish the main villain. If your child is blind and deaf, even then this series would disturb them.",1487980800,,445,4.868421052631579
8578393,4,B00C7RVLX4,"I wanted to watch the full series after I watched a funny man's video online. I wanted to continue, despite knowing he has few follow-up videos. I considered purchasing this until I decided to burrow this using my ILLIAD account. After a few weeks, I got the opportunity and I'm glad I did.

The animation looked sloppy. The running animations looked ridiculous. The characters clipped through themselves and each other at times. When the main characters were fighting, there were times when they weren't even close to the enemy. The voice acting wasn't any better. Some characters sounded annoying while others were better. In addition, a couple of their voices sounded recorded. The sound effects were unfitting and they weren't well-placed. It was also fun to point out how nonsensical the series got. For example, Jack goes to hide after running after the enemy. That said, I laughed a lot for those reasons.

In addition, I wanted to mention Physical Science episode. I was expecting an anti-PS message. Instead, I got a video about a mom helping her son with her homework.

The bigger issue is how most of the lessons I found weren't beneficial. People shouldn't be taught to use violence every time an altercation arises. People also shouldn't be taught to tell others they aren't presentable based on their clothing. (Of course, it's a different matter if someone wears something with an offensive message. If you get a comment for that reason, you had it coming.) Also, people shouldn't be taught to resort to violence because, their God was insulted. That reason's not going to justify your actions to everyone.

That said, I didn't find all of the lessons bad. I appreciated how they included lessons about learning basic skills that will be needed. Also, people should be taught that sometimes they have to fight.

I wanted to mention the characters again. I didn't like any of them because, they were bland. One or two them were annoying at times. Also, I noticed that one of the main characters' name changed. His name was Micah yet he got called Michael. Wait a minute. Those are two different biblical figures. I bought this up because, aside from Jerry, everyone has a biblical name.

All this said, I did enjoy watching this. However, I wouldn't recommend this unless watching bad animations is one of your favorite pastimes. Otherwise, this would be a regretful decision for you.",1478822400,,2398,4.894088669950739
8578394,1,B00C7RVLX4,"I wish I could give this less than 1 stars, less than zero actually. If there was an option to physically purchase cancer cells to insert into my own body, I'd be more inclined to do that than watch this series in its entirety. If God is real, this video's existence makes me question the Lord's intent.",1442016000,5,303,4.333333333333333
8578395,1,B00C7RVLX4,"The fact that this series exists, has been purchased and watched is testament alone that there is no benevolent Creator, for He would not allow such a travesty to come to being.",1441670400,3,177,4.5625

Voice acting = literally phoned in
Animation = not present
Message = uninformed and ignorant

Creativity = playing hooky alongside animation

This will insult the intelligence of children, shame genuinely decent people that may be Christians, make anyone who views television or film as the art form that it is cringe with hopelessness, and legitimately make. You. Dumber. Whoever was a part of this isn't smart enough to be ashamed. Boys of valor? Boys of filth.",1441670400,10,497,5.060975609756097
