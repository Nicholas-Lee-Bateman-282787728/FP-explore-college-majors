8379359,5,B002SEQ924,"What a treasure of a show. We found it on Netflix originally.  My kids love it.  My five and almost seven year old are entertained and the content is completely safe for my 2 year old also.  The language is clean... I mean totally clean without ""stupid"" or ""shut up"" or anything quastionable.  There is a villain who is a little hostile at times, but in the end he always softens and the characters are all friends.  Great show, nice price for this DVD.",1365724800,,453,4.345238095238095
8379360,5,B002SEQ924,"My daughter loves Noonbory and the Super 7.  When I put it on for her, you don't even know she is there.  I find it a bit upsetting that the show was cancelled and of the over 50 shows there are so few on the DVD.  I was able to DVR some of the episodes when it was on CBS.  I wish they would put the rest of the shows on DVD and bring the show back to TV.",1287360000,,356,3.4683544303797467
8379361,5,B002SEQ924,"I've enjoyed Noonbory & the Super Seven the most of all the kiddie programs I've watched with my 3 year old (Shaun the Sheep is a close second). Good stories and excellent characterizations along with trippy, technicolor CGI animation. It might seem impenetrable at first (to adults) because of the odd names, strange language and fast action, but after watching it a few times to become familiar with all the characters it reveals itself as a high-quality offering for children with good messages and genuine humor. Favorite characters: Jettybory and Mamby. Jettybory is a slightly edgy member of the Super Seven with super hearing and is a bit insecure about her small stature. Mamby is a little yellow blob that can do pretty much anything. You could rule the world with a Mamby in your pocket!",1282262400,,797,4.867647058823529
8379362,5,B002SEQ924,"If your kids love silly fun, they will love having this dvd with 3 classic Tubaluba adventures. Makes a great gift for any child. I really like the theme song too. I think one of the versions sounds like it might be done by TMBG (theymightbegiants)? It is very catchy and fun...Like the great cartoon jingles of yesteryear! You can't stop singing it...
Great for distracting your children from boo-boos and boo-hoos. Cheers'em up every time. I mean if Noonbory can save TubaLuba from mean frog-bullies, he can certainly distract your kids from the pain of a scraped knee or stubbed toe.
""Noonbory and the Supr 7
They're savin' TubaLuba again and again-- yeah!!!
Noonbory and the Super 7
There's nothin' that they can't do...
Noonbory and the Super 7
Noonbory and the super 7
Noonbory and the Super 7...""

ps. I really like the little caterpillar bory that can turn into a pair of scissors or a trampoline for the Runaway Peach.

(How old am I anyway??!!!!???) These Noonbories are sense-ational for sure.",1276128000,,1011,4.777142857142858

When trouble is brewing or super silly villainy is taking place in the whimsical word of Toobalooba, it's up to Noonbury and his sensational team of super sensing problem solvers to save the day!  Each of our superhero borys has a super sense, including sight, sound, taste, touch, smell and of course, a little common sense and nonsense never hurts!

Four episodes:

Luky's Bubble Trouble

A Honey of a Tale

Problem Peach

A Rosy Day

Social lessons explored:

Sharing

Patience

Teamwork

Helping

MY THOUGHTS:

Okay so at first I thought the Noonbory & the Super 7 DVD looked...strange to say the least.  It is though an adorable DVD and the animation is awesome.  Everything is so colorful, sharp, and very creative.  Not at all cheesy like I thought at first it would be.  The characters are all adorable and I just want to squeeze them!

My sons love this DVD.  They sat glued to the whole episode!  I love the lessons it teaches of teamwork, sharing, cleaning up, just to name a few!  I love how long the DVD is as there really is a lot to enjoy!  My favorite is the last episode where they are cleaning up, as that is something I am trying to teach my 3 year old.  It is also neat that they focus on all their senses (taste, touch, see, smell...)  which is what Aidan is learning in pre-school right now.  So he was excited when he realized they are using their ""senses"" to save the day!  I also at first thought this DVD would be like Japanimation since the name reminded me of that, but it is just a regular old cartoon, just super colorful, fun, and educational!  I definitely look forward to other Noonbory DVD's!",1272326400,4,1642,4.456081081081081
