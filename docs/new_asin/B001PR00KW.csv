8334335,3,B001PR00KW,"I bought this product for my 2 year old who loves songs... as a kindergarten (Biliterate-Spanish) teacher I found the program to be acceptable.  The songs are usually English songs translated to Spanish... I expected to see ""Pimpon,"" ""Negrita Cucurube,"" or at least ""De Colores""...
The problem that I did have was looking at a young gal with purple hair who seemed to be at a dance studio... very sexy, showing off her legs... talking about her nalgas (buttox; slang) and in another episode some cartoon characters ""check out"" a female passing by... also a boy hurting his dog multiple times by smashing the dogs paws by closing the window... slamming the dog with a door... some characters hurt themselves... all of this is not to productive in my opinion...
The songs are a bit fast... kids usually sing at a slow tempo...  Some songs were great...
Graphics are great... full color... grab your attention...",1307145600,7,909,4.858064516129033
