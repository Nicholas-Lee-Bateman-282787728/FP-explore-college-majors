8534283,1,B0091JJ1VK,"PRODUCT IS POOR QUALITY AND PROBABLY IS NOT A OFFICIAL RELEASE.
I RECOMMEND NOT TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
PLEASE LOOK FOR ANOTHER DVD FOR RICK NELSON'S MUSIC",1356048000,7,157,4.851851851851852
8534284,1,B0091JJ1VK,"ABSOLUTLY AWFUL!!!!
DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!
Extremely bad picture and sound (probably taken from a VHS old tape!!!!!)
As a Rick Nelson fan,i already had this  a long time ago,but then, of very good quality because the DVDs were released from original recordings.
Even the black and white clips taken from the ""Ozzie  & Harriet Show"",you can find them at  YOUTUBE of much better quality!!!
A PERFECT WASTE OF TIME .....AND MONEY!!!!

RICK!!!! Rest in PEACE!!!",1354665600,11,454,5.013333333333334
8534285,1,B0091JJ1VK,"I agree with the previous review- the ""Poor Little Fool"" is anybody who spends money on this thing. This is not ""a concert"", as advertised. What it is, is an attempt to make money by packaging a collection of video scrap, and passing it off as the real deal.  The contents: a rehash of some of the Ricky/Fats Concert; poorly filmed bits and pieces of other concerts; music videos from the Ozzie and Harriet Show; and what looks either old, faded kinescopes, or material filmed directly off a TV.
The segments with acceptable audio/video are available in higher quality on other media; and the rest is just awful amateur stuff, with skips and omissions in the sound, and washed out, distorted video.
I grew up as, and still am, a huge Ricky fan. I saw him live, and would love to see a real concert video, but this is not it.",1353974400,17,824,4.456953642384106
8534286,1,B0091JJ1VK,"As a long time Rick Nelson fan I look forward to any ""NEW Product"" of his music and appearances.  This however, is not one of them.  It's a repackaging of the 1983 and 85 Concerts already available.  The packaging is even a different cover than what you see listed and Young World and Say You Love Me are not included!

Frankly, the quality even if you do not have the original 83 and 85 concerts is terrible.  Washed out, faded picture.  The last song ""Whole Lotta Shakin'"" from Ozzie and Harriet is just pitiful.

Save your money and wait for the Ozzie and Harriet DVD release with Rick singing or hopefully the 1978 Lake Tahoe Concert finally seeing a release.
Disappointing!!",1353801600,14,679,4.56198347107438
