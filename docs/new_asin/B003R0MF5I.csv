4172378,5,B003R0MF5I,"Chuck is in its fourth season now and it's still highly entertaining, fresh, and funny. Personally, I even prefer it to the third season of the show. Hopefully, NBC will renew the show one more time!",1301702400,22,199,4.555555555555555
4172379,5,B003R0MF5I,"The only reason i started to watch chuck in the first place, was because matt bomer was in it and i love him, so i ordered the first 2 seasons cus he was only in those two, but then i got addicted to it and order season 3, i am so in love with chuck.  i haven't seen all of season 4, but what i have i have loved and i cant wait for it to come out on dvd...and i mean it seriously, i cant wait, its driving me nuts..lol very recomemded for chuck fans",1301011200,9,450,3.6875
4172380,5,B003R0MF5I,"NBC's Chuck is one of those ""little"" shows that crawls under your skin in way that you find yourself in one point where you realize you are a complete addict. Yes, I am one of them - Chuck's addicts and my judgment cannot be objective, but if you wanna check my theory just browse wast space of internet and you will find millions of post (mostly on twitter) where this ""little"" show is glorified beyond any other TV show. Why is it so. Well, reason one is for sure the fact that show doesn't it in any TV cliche - although it looks like one of several newly streamlined nerd/geek shows, it's actually - TV genre on its own. It is Action, Drama, Comedy, Romance, Spy Thriller & Sci-Fi - all in one amazing mix of 1 hour of TV entertainment. Genre of its own is Chuck's blessing that makes it so appealing to millions of dedicated fans but at the same time it is its curse cause it doesn't fit in networks ""usual"" & one-faced program slots. As a result - this amazing show is in constant flux and permanent state of ""bubble"".
Unfair ratings - over Nielsen, are disappointing cause statistics as always takes ""representative"" household models & test subjects - typical families. But If you are a part of any social network and if you browse people who are interested in Chuck on generic level - you will find that Chuck's audience ages spread goes (at least) 11 - 50, men & women, mainly between 19 & 40 all over the world. That says something about the quality & variety of Chuck - isn't it?
Amazing Zachary Levi (plays main character - Chuck) is so comfortable in his role you got a feeling he doesn't even have to try to act - he looks like he is not playing Chuck - but he is Chuck in a real life. Beautiful and amazingly talented actress Yvonne Strahovski (plays Sarah Walker, CIA agent and Chuck's fake girlfriend - handler / girlfriend / *** spoiler) leaves viewer stunned & not just because of her top-model looks, but cause she is ""chameleon"" capable to express entire palette of emotions in single one hour episode (i.e. Season 4 Episode 9 ""Chuck versus Phase 3). Adam Baldwin (colonel Casey), Joshua Gomez (Morgan), Ryan McPartlin (""Captain"" Awesome), Sarah Lancaster (Chuck's sister) and many more are team that creates magic. Sure, as any show, Chuck has great and not so great episodes, but overall it's a fun filled hour of TV entertainment.
Season 4 is giving us amazing guest star extravaganza - Linda Hamilton (Chuck's mother), Timothy Dalton (amazing villain Volkoff), John Laroquette (again as charming agent Roan Montgomery) and many, many more.
As far as storyline goes I don't want to spoil anything 4 international Chucksters - but main thing is that the show is growing in a natural way that real life goes without usual forward/backward steps in other shows. Season 4 is next step in the evolution of this amazing show & I sincerely hope (I pray to God) there will be Season 5 of fun/action/drama/comedy/romance/Sci-Fi TV entertainment called - Chuck.",1300924800,20,2975,4.625708884688091
4172381,5,B003R0MF5I,"In its surprisingly good fourth season, ""Chuck"" continues its highly entertaining blend of drama, comedy, and romance.  Nice guy computer nerd and newly minted CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levi) is finally teamed, both personally and professionally, with the lovely and deadly CIA agent Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski).

At the beginning of Season Four, Chuck and best buddy Morgan (Joshua Gomez) search for Chuck's long missing mother Mary Bartkowski (extended cameo by Linda Hamilton), thought to be a rogue agent working for the villainous international arms dealer Alexei Volkov (a superbly over-the-top Timothy Dalton).  In a multi-episode sequence, Chuck, Morgan, Sara and the famously gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin) track and eventually confront Mary Bartkowski and Volkov.  Mary's loyalties are something of a mystery, especially after she deprives Chuck of the use of the Intersect embedded in his brain, which provides him with his spy skills.

Season Four was originally scheduled for 13 episodes, before being extended to a full season.  Lucky fans get two season finales.  In the first, Team Bartkowski tries to protect Chuck's sister Ellie from the Volkov gang, as she prepares to give birth to her first child with husband Captain Awesome, and as Chuck seeks a quiet moment to propose to the evasive Sara.  In the second, Chuck and Sara must escape the revenge of the Volkov family long enough to bring off their own wedding.

The steam could easily have gone out of the series after Chuck and Sara finally got together, but the creative team of Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak keeps finding ways to keep it funny and interesting.  Any number of boomer TV series and movie dramas get hilariously ripped off this season, while a parallel storyline has Casey and Morgan as mismatched house mates and agent partners, with Morgan trying to keep secret his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.

""Chuck: The Complete Fourth Season"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1300838400,55,2010,5.153846153846154
4172382,4,B003R0MF5I,"I was afraid that season four would have been as disappointing as the third - but with the Buy More in the control of the CIA and our two love birds are finally together, the fourth season was a vast improve.

4172385,5,B003R0MF5I,I really enjoyed the first episode of Chuck season four. It reminded me of the excitement I had watching during seasons one & two. I was not a big fan of season three but I am very hopeful about season four. I hope they don't spoil it! That's all I can say.,1285286400,6,257,3.9615384615384617
4172386,5,B003R0MF5I,"I loved the first two years of Chuck but hated much of year 3 - last year. I never even watched all of the episodes of year 3 even though I previously bought them all on demand. I started each one but lost interest in perhaps half of them which weren't funny.

During the third year, we happened to have three sets of house guests (we have a lot of guests because we live in a resort) whom we had turned on to Chuck during year 2. Each of the three couples independently complained that it wasn't funny, sweet or entertaining any more! I'm afraid the producers  have damaged the brand significantly with the poor plots and writing of year three! My friends for example, liked the early shows but probably won't watch again.

As I said, I think 4.1 was good and promising. However if they bring back Superman one more time (even in a dream) I'm through for good!",1285200000,2,861,4.3354037267080745

Season 4 picks up after the AWESOME season three ending (Papa Bartowski's message to Chuck),  I don't want to give stuff away, but the search for HER ends up with some interesting parallels to Chuck and Sarah and we get to see Sarah and Casey change and grow.  There are some less than stellar episodes (Chuck vs Murder, Chuck vs the A Team), but for the most part, the fourth season is hilarious (Chuck vs the Wedding Planner) and heartwarming (moments from Chuck vs the Masquerade).  Btw, look out for some awesome payoffs: there is one sound clip that gets repeated at the end of another episode later (and that moment is just perfect, the kind of thought that goes into it).

4172895,4,B003R0MF5I,"Season three of dramedy Chuck found the show getting more serious as it found the main character fully embracing his new life as a spy.  Season four continued that streak.  It's still good entertainment, but the show lost some of its spark as a result.

When we last left our characters, we were watching the Buy More (think Best Buy clone) going up in flames.  Meanwhile, Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) was promising his sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) that he would give up the dangerous world of spying.

The season four premier picks up several months later.  Chuck and his best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) are conducting a secret mission of their own.  They are attempting to use clues left behind by Chuck's dad to find Chuck's mom, a woman who disappeared 20 years ago.  When it turns out that Chuck's former government handers Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) and John Casey (Adam Baldwin) are on the same hunt, Chuck goes back to work for the CIA.

Meanwhile, the CIA rebuilds the Buy More as a continued cover for their Southern California base and giving the old Buy More gang their old jobs back in the process.  Morgan begins dating Casey's daughter.  Ellie starts investigating her family history, and she and husband Devon (Ryan McPartlin) announce they are expecting.  Plus Chuck and Sarah's relationship continues to build as they work through various issues.

But that's nothing compared to what happens when Chuck actually tracks down his mother Mary (recurring guest star Linda Hamilton) who is working for the Russian Alexei Volkoff (recurring guest star Timothy Dalton).  Can she be trusted?  Or is Chuck about to be hurt worse for having tracked her down?

As the season unfolded, I tuned in every week and enjoyed what I saw, but something felt like it was missing.  It was an episode late in the season coupled with a conversation with my brother and sister-in-law that made me realize what it was.  The first two seasons had a sense of fun and wonder about them.  There were lots of laughs and fun.  This season was just a bit too serious.  Yes, there were the random fun episodes, but most of the storyline involving Volkoff was very serious.  Granted, each episode still has some good laughs, but the show lost the sense of fun it had at the beginning.

That's not to say this wasn't worth watching.  The twists to the story were interesting, and I spent much of the season wondering exactly which side Mary was really on.  While the ending of the Volkoff saga seemed a little forced and unbelievable, I did find it ultimately satisfying.

And there are some fun sub-plots to the season.  Probably my favorite involves Morgan and Casey.  The no-nonsense NSA agent has little patience for Chuck's bumbling best friend, and the fact that they have to work together on missions is nothing compared to when he realizes that Morgan is dating his daughter.  Those moments are priceless.

Not quite as fun as they used to be are Jeff (Scott Krinsky), Lester (Vik Sahay), and Big Mike (Mark Christopher Lawrence), the Buy More workers who actually have names.  They haven't really developed much in a couple of seasons now, and as a result, their sub-plots don't provide the comedy they once did.

Speaking of developing, I felt the writers and producers did a good job of developing Chuck and Sarah's relationship.  They have managed to avoid the curse of killing a show when you get the main couple together by developing their relationship and giving them realistic things they need to work on.  It's interesting watching it develop, and I like that.

As always with this show, the acting is top notch.  From everything I've heard, the cast loves working together, and it shows in the chemistry they have on screen.  They also know their characters, and their portrayals are flawless.  In addition to the guest stars I already mentions (who are both great), Robert Englund stops by for the Halloween episode as a man who has developed a toxin to give people nightmares.  Obvious casting?  Yes, but it's also lots of fun.

As with last season, the show was originally renewed for 13 episodes and then picked up for a back 11.  That means that the first 13 episodes tell their own story with a second story springing off that one in the second half.  Even the second half of the season reveals some secrets about the Bartowski family legacy.

It also means that this season set includes 24 episodes of the show in original wide screen and full surround.  In addition to the gag reel and deleted scenes, there's a featurette about Zachary Levi stepping behind the camera to direct the Thanksgiving episode as well as a collection of Webisodes featuring Jeff and Lester's quest for a video game.  Finally, the Blu-ray set (it comes on DVD or Blu-ray) contains an interacting Chuckapedia.

While I missed the lighter tone of earlier seasons, I still enjoyed season four of Chuck.  The characters are still endearing and the storylines worth watching.  If you haven't caught all of season four, fix that today.",1432425600,,5027,4.78281068524971

Watching Chuck and Sarah's relationship develop throughout the season was fantastic as well. There are great character moments for every character in this season, and while a few story lines overstay their welcome, overall it is still a solid season. Volkoff makes a fantastic villain, and I found him hilarious yet threatening, definitely with signs of bipolar and insanity! He's not on the same level as Shaw, but he makes a worthy opponent all the same. This is a great season, of my favorite show.",1428364800,,618,4.785046728971962

4173230,3,B003R0MF5I,"I--like many women worldwide--fell hopelessly in love with Zachary Levi as Chuck in the first three seasons of this show.  The plotlines, the chemistry between Chuck and Sarah (or Lou...or Hannah...or Jill...), how he managed to get out of scrapes...bringing Morgan into the fold in Season 3, all of it.  Had me hook, line, and intersect.

Then Season 4.

Ohhh, Season 4.  Why must you betray me?

I don't know if a writer left the staff, or if they just decided now that Chuck and Sarah are an item that the plots didn't matter as much, or got to a point where they were secure enough in their fan base to start messing with it, but honestly, this season feels overly formulaic and jump-the-shark every episode.  I just finished Disc 3 of this season and honestly...I'm not sure if I want to finish watching the rest of the season, or Season 5 for that matter.

Some people love the Timothy Dalton/Linda Hamilton additions to the cast.  I personally think the season suffers from it.  The Ring and Fulcrum made everything seem actually menacing and dangerous, where as Volkoff just seems campy and silly.  Linda Hamilton is nowhere near as compelling as Orion was.

I think Sarah's character is getting pretty diluted at this point as well.

Essentially, IMHO, this season is to the Chuck franchise what Pirates of the Caribbean 2/3/4 were to the first movie.  If I keep watching at this point, it'll be because I'm invested enough in the characters to want to see what happens to them...not because the story is compelling.  That makes me sad.

On the grainy video:  It just looks to me like they changed filming style this season.  I think that's a stylistic camera choice, not the DVD quality.  I have the other seasons on DVD (not BluRay) as well and they do look different.",1366156800,2,1779,4.644230769230769

If you've followed the season through 3 seasons, by season 4 you know what to expect: an overarching story that just builds and builds, without the ridiculous cliffhangers some shows (Lost, I'm looking at you) feel the need to use to keep you watching.  Each episode is a complete story with a solid beginning, middle and end, but it all points to the ultimate battle that you know is coming.  When it seems things can't get any more tense, they do!  Over and over and over again.  And when the tension gets too strong, they throw in a joke or a lighthearted moment and it just makes you love the show that much more.

If you're trying to decide between the Blu-Ray and the DVD, the Blu-Ray is worth the extra picture quality for Season 4.",1354060800,,925,4.281609195402299

4173377,4,B003R0MF5I,"Chuck Bartowski embarks on a personal mission to track down his missing mother, aided by John Casey and Sarah Walker. However, they soon discover that Chuck's mother may have ties to Volkoff Industries, an international arms-dealing organisation based in Moscow and now their their #1 target. Complications ensue as Chuck and Sarah get engaged, Ellie and Devon have a baby and an old computer resurfaces which may hold the key to an old mystery...

Chuck's fourth and penultimate season is a bit of a mixed bag. It's as reliably watchable as ever but a feeling of staleness is never too far away. Chuck's search for his mum feels a little derivative of his earlier search for his father. The producers try to make the two storylines more individual by painting the characters very differently and approaching the plots in different ways (we meet Chuck's mother very early on and see how she reacts to Chuck's attempts to find her), but there is the feeling that we have been here before. Linda Hamilton's casting as Chuck's mother may also be a geek-friendly nod to the audience (and an excuse for a few Terminator gags), but unfortunately Hamilton gives a stiff and somewhat unconvincing performance that doesn't help the problem.

Much more successful is Timothy Dalton, channelling pure scenery-chewing villainy in his role as Volkoff, an evil arms-dealer with a surprisingly sentimental side (a sequence where he plays charades is particularly demented). His appearances are highlights of the season.

Where the story goes awry is in the show's descent into predictable cliche. Sarah and Chuck have been together for more than five minutes, so clearly they now have to talk about getting married, with all the attendant, predictable storylines that brings along with it. The actors do their best with the material, but it feels like Chuck-the-espionage-comedy-drama is losing ground to Chuck-the-soap-opera, which is a fundamentally less interesting show. This isn't helped by the emphasis moving more away from the Buy More, with less screen time for Jeff and Lester's crazy antics or Big Mike's curiously entertaining Subway obsession. Isaiah Mustafa (aka 'the Old Spice advert guy') appears a recurring employee at the Buy More which sets up an amusing storyline, but again it fails to fulfil its potential and he soon disappears.

Still, the show remains enjoyable on an episode-by-episode basis. At 24 episodes, it's the longest season of the entire series and this would risk the storyline becoming overstretched, but the writers break it into two half-seasons to better handle things. The first half revolves around the battle against Volkoff and the search for Chuck's mum, whilst the second sees a return to more stand-alone storylines before a new story arc involving Volkoff's daughter (an under-written Lauren Cohan) kicks off. This arc, in which Chuck inadvertently turns Volkoff's daughter from an ally into an enemy, is potentially fascinating but falls apart due to some clunky writing and contrived events.

The fourth season of Chuck (***) has many individually entertaining episodes and moments, and the regular cast remains as watchable as ever, but there is a feeling of tiredness creeping into affairs. However, the show is rejuvenated by a shake-up in the final episode that could make the fifth and final season more interesting.

The packaging and discs looked new and authentic, but viewing from 8' away, the picture exhibited a significant loss of detail, noticeable and distracting background pixilation, blotchy colors and a fuzzy quality that looked like I was watching thru a window screen.

4173406,5,B003R0MF5I,"This season of Chuck follow the same formula as Chuck Seasons 1-3. In the past, the show has focused on Chuck trying to stay alive (season 1), Chuck getting the girl and learning about his father (season 2), more of Chuck and his father and his girl (season 3).

Season 4 opens up a lot more characters than just Chuck, Sarah (his girl) and his dad. This time, we get much deeper in Morgan's life. We get a first good glimpse into Casey's past life. And we also continue to look into the dark corners of Chuck's and Sarah's lives.

The series hits some rough spots by including some horrible product placement spots. They were obviously aiming for an effect like the funny spots on Arrested Development, but it just ends up looking like begging and fund raising. Chuck pulls out a Tide stick and points the label at the camera and smiles. A scene starts with a car label that makes the show feel like it's the start of a commercial. And, of course, subway sandwiches are everywhere.

It was a bit much.

The season gets a bit boring somewhere around 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through, but then picks right back up.

The show ends with a cliffhanger (as many do), so you'll definitely want to get the final season 5 after watching this one.",1332374400,,1235,4.399122807017544

4173560,5,B003R0MF5I,"Another awesome season of Chuck down the hatch. I had my worries about what would be seen in season 4, and i am happy to say that any fan of Chuck will not be disappointed. The same-old comedy that existed in the first 3 seasons remain intact, and the fresh continuing new story of Chuck doesnt seem to run out of ideas before running out of episodes(always the worry of new seasons there).

Chuck is back around as our clumsy, lovable hero has gone from unknown computer geek to fresh new spy with the Intersect, and he's got the girl: the beautiful Sarah Walker that waits for him at work everyday. Newcomers who need initiation to the series better remedy that by watching seasons 1-3, cuz this season is not gonna have time to play ""catch up"". Season 4 begins pretty much where season 3 had ended. Chuck wants to find his mother and piece together the mystery of her disappearance from his life at a young age. Morgan, Sarah and John agree to help him do exactly while back at the sunny place of Burbank, we find out Chuck's sister and brother-in-law, Ellie and Devon are due for a child. Meanwhile, Chuck really wants to move things up with Sarah and pop the old question, and get the rest of his family back together in time.

After i was finished watching this, i was relieved to hear that Chuck would be up for a 5th and final season, and of course, the worry of what will happen this season is in check. If watching this 4th season of Sarah taking it upon herself to try to save Chuck from a psychopath who wants the intersect for himself, or Chuck and Sarah's adventures alone wasn't enough for you with this season, well wait till season 5 begins. . .",1318723200,,1662,4.375404530744337

4173577,5,B003R0MF5I,"Chuck is a great show. It is a nice breath of fresh air from other comedies and reality shows. Chuck is one of the most creative concepts on television. I don't want to spoil the story so I won't say much. All I will say is that it is very well written and does not include many cliches. The show is unpredictable and includes many twists and turns. The acting on Chuck is very good. Each actor plays their character perfectly and I wouldn't make any adjustments to the cast. All the actors seem extremely comfortable in their roles. Whoever did the casting is very talented. Chuck is a good mix of action and comedy. The action sequences are intense and the hand to hand combat is wonderful. It is very addicting and fun to watch. Their is a dash of romance but is in no way over the top. If you have not watched the first three seasons then I highly suggest you watch those before this. You can still catch on to the story and enjoy Chuck if you start this season, but you will miss a lot of backstories that make the characters even more likable. In Season 4, we learn a lot more about Chuck and Sarah's relationship. New characters are also introduced. Season 4 is a great addition to the Chuck series. I would like to see much more of Casey and Morgan in the next season. We saw a lot of them in the first three seasons and even in this seasson but I still think they have much more to offer. I think we will see more of Morgan based on the Cliffhanger but I won't ruin anything. One of the best things about this season is that we get to dive even deeper into the characters and learn even more about their pasts. Overall, Chuck is one of the best shows on television. Everything is outstanding and I cannot believe this show doesn't have more fans. I can't wait for season 5. Do yourself a favor and try out Chuck.",1307491200,3,1821,4.235632183908046

This season was no exception, although it seems that the writers had a harder time writing it. There is some back-story that explains why this season isn't as strong as the first ones: apparently it was on the chopping block at NBC, despite the fact it was one of their strongest shows. The fans of this show are amazing though, and have brought it back for yet another season by means of a grass roots campaign for Subway and some of the other advertisers. I like to think that I played a tiny part of this, buy buying the DVDs for the first three seasons, preordering season 4, and writing a few emails to NBC executives. The possibility of a Season five was looking bad right up until the week that the final episode of season 4 aired - then NBC announce it would bring back Chuck for a fifth and final Season, and give it an ending that it deserved.

4173581,5,B003R0MF5I,"Every new fall season, there's this fear that my favorite TV shows wouldn't be on the roster. With CHUCK getting the nod for a fifth and final season, there's a sigh of relief. It's very hard for me to be impartial and critique this show. And I won't even try, really. But, okay, maybe I'll mention that perhaps CHUCK's getting only one more season may be a good thing. In Season 4, there's been a creeping sense of familiarity, a nagging worry that maybe, just maybe, the show's slowing down some.

It's still a cool premise, hapless nerd secretly a brilliant spy. And the cast still demonstrates that banging chemistry. But the central tension always was in Chuck and Sarah's relationship. Once they formally became a couple in Season 3, I was happy as pigs in mud but also concerned about where the show would go from here on out, what with that central conflict being resolved. Remember what happened to MOONLIGHTING once David and Maddy hooked up?

But CHUCK isn't all about a nerd's hopeless romantic pinings. And, in the area of wicked espionage and devilish plot twists and just plain exploiting the Intersect, the show exhibits plenty of legs. In Season 3's finale, Chuck had promised his sister that he's out of the spy game for good, and I think we all got a good snicker out of that. Like a phoenix from the ashes or a cockroach shrugging off the holocaust, the Burbank Buy More store is back, rebuilt and revamped and become a full-fledged, covert joint NSA/CIA operation. Because when Chuck Bartowski doesn't come to the spy game, the spy game comes to Chuck Bartowski.

It's all a subterfuge, of course, his fellow spies assuming that Chuck had quit espionage, with Sarah pulling off missions with John Casey while Chuck frets at home. But Chuck is up to something. He's following leads on his long-thought-to-be-dead mother, with Morgan as his only backup. The subterfuge lasts only during the season opener, though. And, somewhere in this first episode, for fun, we get ""sexting"" between Chuck and Sarah, except that it's really between Morgan and an unwitting Sarah (ugh!). Chuck and Morgan even find time to attend a hand-to-hand combat class in, uh, ""strip-kick,"" a discipline which combines the ""self-defense of Krav Maga with the intense core workout of pole dancing."" Heh.

The rest of Season 4 tracks Chuck's search for his mom and the agents' ongoing mission to take down Volkoff Industries, a new criminal organization. Just about each episode explores a facet of Chuck and Sarah's relationship, ranging from their first fight as a couple to their inability to air out their feelings to why Sarah refuses to bring personal mementos with her on missions. But the show doesn't neglect its other characters, whether it's John Casey's own relationship with his daughter or Awesome and Ellie's pregnancy or Morgan's gradual inclusion into the inner circle (Morgan more or less worms his way in).

Viewing CHUCK is like going to fan boy heaven. It's a big get, casting Linda Hamilton as Chuck's mom. Another nice conceit is that the new BuyMore regularly rotates a roster of agents whose name tag is always ""Greta."" For the first few episodes, each week unveiled a new star cameo. So we see ""Greta"" being played by the likes of geek goddess Olivia Munn, Summer Glau, and even by the Old Spice guy. For villains, we get familiar sorts like Timothy Dalton, Lou Ferrigno, Richard Chamberlain, and Dolph Lundgren (who even quotes his famous Ivan Drago line).

Another thing I love about CHUCK is that it never hesitates to upend the status quo. I love the unpredictability of the episodes. The characters evolve (well, maybe not Jeffster), and, as for Chuck's mom, for plenty of episodes, I wasn't entirely certain which side she'd fall on. At this stage, the challenge is how to keep Chuck Bartowski a total badasss on the field while still retaining his nerd creds. Thank goodness you can't totally shed your neuroses. I guess if you're a sorry bloke what happened to land a smoking hot girlfriend, chances are there's a part of you that'll always be insecure. Except that, lately, Chuck's development hasn't been as arrested.

Just about each episode is terrific, but I did like some better than others, and here's a SPOILERS alert. In ""Chuck Vs. The Cat Squad,"" Chuck reunites Sarah with her old spy team. I love ""Chuck Vs. Phase Three"" because it reaffirms Sarah Walker's badassery. I love that a legend builds around Sarah as she carves a swath thru the jungles of Southeast Asia, beating up on guy after guy in her quest to find an Intersect-less Chuck. ""Chuck Vs. The Muuurder"" challenges Chuck's leadership skills when he's put in charge of a crucial mission, and then a murder mystery surfaces. And in ""Chuck Vs. The Wedding Planner,"" Chuck and Sarah are scammed out of their wedding money and Sarah reluctantly goes to her con man dad to get the money back.

Despite mad support from its ardent fans, CHUCK, each season, has been on the brink of cancellation, so it's amazing and really gratifying that it's lasted this long. And, dammit, you know what, I take back what I said earlier. This show isn't in danger of growing stale. The stories are too inventive, the cast is too good, the humor too water cooler, and the hook simply too irresistible. Hell yes to Season 5. That new car smell forever!!

On the way, he finds out many things about himself and even much more about a girl who enters his life just when everything changes.",1528070400,,415,4.402597402597403

Best Cast I have ever seen put together and the characters were all nailed!!  Romance, comedy, action, adventure, suspense and the emotional bonding mix was superb!  I am still amazed that this show was cancelled, makes no sense to me.",1526256000,,339,4.6
8402839,5,B003R0MF5I,"I love Chuck.  We've been re-watching the series and it's surprising how much we don't remember and how many noteworthy co-stars were on this show.  Walking Dead fans will notice a familiar face when they get to this season.

If you haven't seen Chuck, you should definitely pick up season 1 and start watching.  It's amazing.

One complaint - the seller I got this DVD set from sold it without the DVD liner notes summarizing all the episodes that was present in all the other seasons I've purchased.  Maybe they stopped including it by season 4.  I don't know.",1525996800,,562,4.616161616161616
