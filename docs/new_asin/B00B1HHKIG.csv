8566965,5,B00B1HHKIG,"This movie combined with the book, ""Black Thursday"" is a powerful combination that captures the struggle that is not only happening in Washington State, but every state in the country. Our Constitutional Rights as Americans who desire to peaceably assemble & express ourselves is under fire by local and state governments.  This movie is inspirational, and I hope it not only serves as a wake-up call to all motorcyclists throughout the country, but also every freedom loving American. Excellent job!",1384560000,3,500,5.25
