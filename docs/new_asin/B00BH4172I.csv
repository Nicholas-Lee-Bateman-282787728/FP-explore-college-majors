5620987,5,B00BH4172I,"Our family has enjoyed The Statler Brothers for many years. This film is heartwarming, but a bit sad since they have retired from touring. Their voices have never sounded better though. A good purchase.",1378512000,4,202,4.970588235294118

5620992,4,B00BH4172I,"Having been a fan of the Statler Brothers since they first came to national prominence in the 1960s, their last public performance was a must for me to have.  I already owned the CD of their performance, but the DVD added the visual part I was missing.  Their performance on this DVD was masterful, and I will watch it many times.  Loved the performance, music, stories, and the video leading up to the performance.  If there was one thing  that would have made this better, it would have been that this performance be in BluRay format.  If you are a fan of the Statler Brothers, then this is the DVD to have.",1505520000,,609,4.392857142857143
5620993,5,B00BH4172I,"What a lovely way to end a career!  The tempos were all too fast, but I assume that was them trying to do as many songs as possible one more time to please their family and friends at the concert.  Harold and Don's comedy was spot on too and the musicianship was excellent.  And, if you're wondering, yes, nice things were said about the late Lew Dewitt at the end of this concert...18 years singing tenor with the quartet and wrote their 1st hit Flowers on the Wall.",1503964800,,467,4.284090909090909

I just don't have the words to explain how great & Heartfelt this performance was. I have been in and around Music { Mostly Country} 60 years of my 76 & The Stats are the # 1 Vocal Group of All Time In My Opinion.  After 39 years, Their rendition of All Their Recordings is as 'Pitch Perfect' on A Live Concert, as it was the day they recorded it in The Studio. """"And Thats The Way Folks Want To hear It & The Way The Stats Do It. I Purchase All My Music & DVDs from Amazon and I would Highly Reccomend this DVD of The Stats.

5621069,5,B00BH4172I,"The final concert appearance by the Statler Brothers recorded live in 2002.  Roughly 90 minutes of songs and reminiscing by members of one of the better Country music acts from the 1960s through the 1990s.  21 Musical numbers with spoken interludes.  With the concert being recorded live, some of the songs might not sound as crisp as on a studio production, but it's hard for anything this group does to be considered second rate.  I bought a new copy from a local merchant after the used copy I had purchased on Amazon proved to be defective.  (The seller refunded my purchase costs).  After watching it, my only disappointment was that the concert wasn't longer.  Really too bad many current recording artists aren't as classy as this group.",1417996800,6,744,4.811023622047244

The only thing that happens on Calvary is crucifixion....Do these quartet singers realize that they are asking God for a cross to be nailed to???

5621109,5,B00BH4172I,"I rarely review items on Amazon, but I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this DVD. I saw part of this performance on a local PBS fundraiser, and had to buy the entire concert on DVD. It has become a staple in our house, with my wife and two young children enjoying it as much as I do. The songs are beautiful, the Statlers are SO talented and the jokes are perfect for the family. The performances are incredible, and I can't imagine them ever sounding better than they do here. All this from their very last show and them mostly in their 60's here.

It's very sad for America that these guys have retired, but they deserve it and I hope that they are enjoying themselves. In the meantime, we can watch and enjoy what they left behind. Memories are made of this.",1391126400,22,767,4.289655172413793
