I watched this movie because I'm a huge fan of Kris Lemche and I really enjoyed this film!",1436313600,,207,4.073170731707317
8592261,1,B00DDT93X0,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen (and I sat through 45 minutes of Pacific Rim).

Acting as horrible... and I mean _horrible_... like HORRIBLE. The fight scenes... please don't make me think about them again. The script is full of holes the size of a city bus.

It's a join effort between the entertainment powerhouses of Canada and Romania so I'm not sure how it ended up so bad, but somehow it did...

It would be good for one of the possible three scenarios:

a) you're nine years old and you're poor... poor people have better imaginations... with a good imagination you could pretend this movie doesn't make you want to vomit
b) the cast of MST 3000
c) actually, that's it... no one else.

I can only hope everyone associated with this movie is now dead as I'm 96% sure it gave me rectal cancer.",1400976000,2,805,4.412162162162162
