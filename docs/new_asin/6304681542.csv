The movie could have had a bit more development regarding the patients characters, especially Toni Collette's. The times when Toni Collette is on-screen or singing were absolutely entrancing. After this movie, Toni Collette can do no wrong.  END",898732800,3,405,5.136363636363637

Louis is suppose to direct the patients in a production of his choice but is completely overwhelmed by Roy, a patient, who wants to put on a production of the opera Cosi Fan Tutte by none other than Mozart!

Roy doesn't seem to care that his fellow patients can't speak Italian or for that matter even sing very well. Louis bonds with his players and manages to produce a witty, brilliant, bizarre production while the players accomplish the unbelievable.

The movie stars Toni Collette (who had a war of nerves with producers who wanted her to shave her underarms. She did not want to, believing she was keeping in character...she won).

Barry Otto is fansastic,  you just want to slap him a lot of the time, and Ben Mendelsohn is typically good. It is a shame he has been typcast as commic relief in the US as he is way better than that. If you like music, comedy and something a little off beat and different, give it a go. Strong themes of fidelity and what it means throughout, so be warned. You probably don't want to watch it with a recent ex :-)",1242000000,,610,4.258620689655173

924004,5,6304681542,"I'm a fan of Toni Collette's acting talents ever since watching her play Muriel in 'Muriel's Wedding' (A film I've watched so many times that I'm ashamed to admit the number). I was just as enamored with her brilliant performance in this wonderful film. In fact, the entire cast in 'Cosi' are absolutely brilliant and I laughed so hard I know I sounded like a hen about to lay an egg. Once you've encountered the unique characters in this movie they will become unforgettable. The task of a director attempting to put together a difficult play casting mentally ill patients is a witty concept in itself, but the movie's director, Mark Joffe, molds the story into a revolutionary comedy while also bringing to the surface the underlying struggles of mental illness, relationships, and the all-consuming magic of the theatre. Bravo!!!

924091,5,6304681542,"This is a wonderfully touching movie!  I've watched it several times over and simply love it each time.  It's funny...it's sad...it's human...it's life.  As moving as this story is, I don't recommend it for children due to the language.  On my scale of buy, or not to buy...definitely a buy!

This is the story of a young man (Lewis), an amateur theatre director, who's just having the devil of a time figuring out his life.  He looses his job and reluctantly takes a position as an activities director in a government-run program for the rehabilitation of people with varying degrees of mental illness.

As activites director, Lewis is tasked with organizing a seriously dysfunctional group of mentally ill individuals to put on a show to justify the funding and existance of the program.  He's absolutely horrified when introduced to his ""charges"" and wants nothing to do with the project.  He's persuaded to take on the challenge, and the adventure of a lifetime begins.  As hard as Lewis tries to stay emotionally detached from his cast, he finds he can't help but let them into his life.  To his surprise, the closer he gets to them the more he learns about himself, his own life, and life in general.

For their presentation, the group decides they want to do a play and pick Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte.  I don't think this particular production was quite what Mozart had in mind for his play!  What could go wrong?  Oh my!  What couldn't go wrong?!?!  Everything you can think of happens during the rehearsals and the actual presentation of the play.  The actors are trained well though, and the show goes on to finish...and...what a finish it is!

The sadness, humor and frailty of each character portrayed in this movie is just fantastic.  The acting is superb.  The directing excellent.  This is just an all around good movie.",1138406400,7,1833,4.752380952380952
924092,4,6304681542,"This is a funny and poignant story- our hero is hired to direct a play at a mental hospital as a type of therapy for the patients. Lewis is not quite sure what he is in for. He meets an vaired assortment of societal outcasts and oddballs who in the end don't appear to be all that different from the people outside the institution.

Notable performances-

Ben Mendelsohn as Lewis the director

Rachel Griffiths as Lucy his girlfriend

Toni Collette as Julie a troubled young woman whose parents have sent her to a mental institution to deal with her drug problem

David Wenham ( aka Faramir from Return of the King) plays Doug a disturbed pyromaniac who stirs up trouble for the production.

The patients do not settle for some lame variety show and push to put on an opera- Cosi Fan Tutte by Mozart. They do the opera as a play in English with singing for the finale. The play's theme is echoed by the events of the film- Lewis's friend Nick moves in with Lewis and Lucy and tells Lewis she is cheating on him. They make a bet. The play revolves around two young soldiers who make a bet that their women will be true- and then deceive them and the women fall in love with the new men they think they have met while their men are off at war.

The comedy is typical Aussie- a combo of physical slapstick and sight gags and some biting verbal barbs.

Toni Collette proves here she can sing beautifully- does an a cappella rendition of Stand By Me that steals the show.

Enjoyable overall- a gem in the rough I was pleased to stumble onto!",1124841600,3,1536,4.3426573426573425
924093,4,6304681542,"The Australian film industry gave us this little treasure about a young man who can't keep a job. His tenure at an insane asylum is cut short by an out-of-control patient, who is only one of MANY - you will never forget Roy! The Opera Cosi Fan Tutti is presented in such a fun way that you almost wish you could see the whole thing. The 'heart-warming' ending doesn't detract too much, but be sure to stay ALL the way through the credits.",1115337600,7,438,4.289156626506024
924094,5,6304681542,"""Cosi"" is a great film I think. I watched in the television and I simply liked it very much. After that, I bought the DVD of the film. The most impressive part of this movie is simplicity I think. Yes, it is a simple film but there are secret interpretions and comments about the opera of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, ""Cosi Fan Tutte"". This is mainly why I liked this movie. Simplicity is something magical I think. Everybody can say a lot of things about Mozart, his opera ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" with complicated words but this movie showed me what a mental patient can think about this opera and honestly, I gained a different point of view. Their simple ideas were really very powerful. They seem to be not interested in playing in the opera ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" but when you watch them, watch their actions, you understand that, they believe in playing this opera than any other can. They maybe mentally impaired but their hearts, their souls are as healthy as or maybe more healthy than a mentally normal person. The second important thing of the film for me is the characterisation. The perfect match of the characters really impress me so much. They, the patients always argue with each other but I sense a strange bound between them. So, if you want to see a lovely comedy, if you want to gain a different point of view, if you want to watch two lovely, beautiful and talented actresses - Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths - and if you want to witness to the reborn of the opera ""Cosi Fan Tutte"", I strongly recommend you to watch the movie ""Cosi"".",1112054400,3,1543,4.514285714285714

924096,4,6304681542,"Cosi is an absolutely fantastic find in the sea of Australian movies that are often total trash! A truly honest and original film, it creates several hilarious psychiatric patients including a pyromaniac to make Cosi a captivating story that really does entertain you for a couple of hours.
Based on the play written by Louis Nowra, Cosi is the uplifting story of how a group of psychiatric hospital tenants come together to perform an Italian opera Cosi Fan Tutte (Mozart) against the initial thoughts of the amateur director who has agreed to help the patients ""come out of their shells"". This is a tale of how ""Jerry"" (as one of the patient labels him) learns to accept these people and eventually he discovers and reveals to the audience that although these people are considered ""crazy lunatics"", they are, in essence, no more crazy than the people on the 'outside'.
This movie is for those looking for an original, creative film that guarantees laughs and smiles as well as entertaining characters and good ol' Aussie humour.",1041206400,10,1031,4.897142857142857

924100,4,6304681542,"A poignant and touching australian comedy drama which I highly recommend  to film buffs out for some much needed relief from sci-fi, action films and  special effects. The story centres around Lewis, a young sydneysider who  half-heartedly applies for a job as an occupational therapist in a Sydney  mental hospital, and gets it at he toss of a coin, literally. His main  brief is to organise a variety show for the patients but this is  immediately suborned by one persistent resident who insists they instead  perform Mozart's complicated romance""Cosi fan Tutte"". Thereby he  is introduced to an interesting cast of characters each with their own  phobias, psychoses and hangups. This and his own relationship worries with  partner Lucy do not make life any easier. Enough said.
Lewis' cast is  comprised of the usual suspects. Roy a manic esthete with a thirst for  stage exposure, the painfully shy but suicidal Ruth, Doug the young  foul-mouthed pyromaniac and Julie, the recovering drug addict played by a  svelte Toni Collette almost unrecognizable from her 'Muriel' role. Cuckoos  Nest this is not although the film does lend itself to the same theme. That  united with people with whom we would otherwise not associate for a common  cause, imperfect as they may be is uplifting in itself. Dealing with wilful  mental patients like Roy and the violently agressive Cherry who have their  own ideas about stage direction, Lewis fears for his own safety but before  he quits suddenly realises that for all their idiosyncracies he really does  like the misfits and decides to give it his best shot. Having worked in a  psychiatric institution I found the portrayals well researched and not over  the top as has been suggested. Also endearing was the head nurse, Errol who  despite his burnt out approach and not looking out of place with a fag in  his mouth really did show he cared. My only gripe is that Toni Collette was  underused especially with that marvellous voice. Well, more kudos to the  aussies for a job well done, and this from a kiwi!  Save this one for a  rainy day, or better yet give the disappointing MI2 a miss and rent Cosi  out for the night. You won't be disappointed.",961372800,12,2195,4.8382749326145555
