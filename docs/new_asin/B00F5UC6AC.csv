8612492,5,B00F5UC6AC,"I bought this from Amazon UK and it's fantastic to get the entire live series, two movies and 47 (out of 52) episodes of the Animated Series in a box set. It's the same size as my A&E Mr Bean set from 2003 (also called The Whole Bean).

If you don't have a region-free dvd player, then don't get this set as it won't work for you. DVDs are coded to only play for certain geographies so that movie companies can make more money; for instance, USA is Region 1 and Great Britain is Region 2. The other reviewers likely did not have region-free players. If you don't know whether your dvd player is region-free, then it is probably not.

The Comic Relief and Red-Nose Day sketches are not included here and the live series is missing the sketches with the chair and the turkey.

The Animated series is 6 discs and includes all of seasons 1-3 episodes except for episodes 1, 9, 13, 14, 15 of season 2.

Until the next release of a ""complete"" set, this is as good as it gets for now, as long as your dvd player can play them.",1512518400,,1019,4.21025641025641
8612493,3,B00F5UC6AC,Three discs in the set arrived loose in the case and scratched.  I hope they are still playable but will not know for sure until I give the set to my son for his birthday in October.,1501459200,,182,3.918918918918919
