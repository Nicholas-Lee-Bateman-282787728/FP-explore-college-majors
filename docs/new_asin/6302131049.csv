433223,5,6302131049,"I saw this movie late one night as it was offered on netflix's streaming to computer option and I instantly fell in love with it! It's a romantic comedy but as it was made in 1986 it has such a different, in some ways more authentic feel to it versus the more modern ""rom-coms"". I instantly fell in love with the leads and I just had to own the DvD myself.
As a 22 year old female that isn't too fond over the over the top predictable romantic type comedies coming out these days, this movie was refreshing and genuinely funny. I only wish the film could have been longer!
5 stars!",1294963200,2,581,4.196428571428571
433224,5,6302131049,Has a nice independent film feeling. Roberts plays a good guy this time. Arquette is quite annoying. Worth your time to see this one.,1265760000,,133,4.583333333333333

433226,5,6302131049,"Outstanding screenplay, direction, acting, and musical score. I have watched this film several times, it is an amazing feel good romantic drama/comedy (more drama than comedy, but very quirky and funny in many spots). Rosanna Arquette shines in this film as our hero seeking love, and escape from her small hometown, perhaps more importantly her character seeks to find her inner self. I wish they would have released a soundtrack CD for this film, or perhaps now they could at least distribute it as download as digital music (hoping). I give this film five stars as a romance drama-comedy, but of course it is drama, and independent film, so do not expect huge budget special effects. The film is shot in the New Mexico/Arizona region, with some nice backdrops.  Note: The Amazon description of the DVD here says it is 1.33:1 (4:3 TV mode), but I already purchased two copies and the DVD includes both 1.33:1 as well as widescreen mode (which I have viewed off the DVD).",1187913600,4,972,4.785714285714286
433227,5,6302131049,This movie needs to come out on DVD....  Does anyone know WHEN it might?,1065830400,3,72,4.142857142857143
433228,4,6302131049,"I saw this film when it ran in NYC in 1986, and like the rest of the audience (who applauded when it was over), was totally charmed by it.  I could never understand why it didn't do better at the box office - poor marketing, perhaps?  I understand it's done very well as a video.
The performances and the originality of the script are what stand out in this film.  Rosanna Arquette manages to be funny and heartbreaking at the same time. Eric Roberts is so damned sexy and appealing in this film, it's hard to understand why he didn't get more romantic leads.  When Arquette's character shouts at him, ""Stop looking at me with those eyes!"", every woman in the audience knows what she is talking about. He is magnetic, and gives great dimension to a somewhat underwritten part.  The chemistry between these two is great.  All of the supporting actors give first rate performances.
Some of the quirkiness of Beth Henley's script could have been whittled down - she seems to delight in presenting odd characters for effect, such as the albino bride, schizophrenic cousin and the obese younger brother, who don't add a lot to the story, but seem like contrived distractions.  These elements might work in her plays, but only take away from the development of the main characters and their relationship to each other.
What she does get right is the complex relationship between love, obsession, humor and disaster.  In Henley's world, tragedy exists right around the corner from happiness, and nothing is black and white.
It was interesting to read the comments from Dean, an actor in this film.  It does seem like editing might have done this one in. I could have used more development of the Riley character, a little more humor, and less parading of oddballs.
But all in all, a worthwhile film for its performances and originality.  It looks good too, with lovely shots of the outdoors, and attractive, appealing leads.  All in all, one of the more memorable movies I've ever seen. Even if it stunk at the box office, those involved should be proud of it.",1014595200,23,2053,4.706703910614525
433229,5,6302131049,"Hi, as one of the actors in this small film, I really appreciate the kind words about it. The screenplay by Beth Henley was very funny, infact, in it's original form, the script was a laugh riot. Somehow, either by cost cutting or by director and editing cuts the film was whittled down to a quirky romance, with a lot of the comedy missing. It's still a sweet and funny film. So buy it or rent it, but if you like quirky characters, you'll like this film. -Dean Ricca",980812800,15,468,4.269662921348314
433230,4,6302131049,"A real sleeper - a quirky caricature town masks wonderful character development.  Roberts is extraordinary as vulnerable, loner, insecure, long reformed bad boy from LA; Arquette tugs at heart strings as Scarlet Letter  woman in small town, an outcast as much because she's an individual as  because of what she's done.  Watch for Roberts' scene with Arquette in the  spaghetti dinner hall near the end - if you're not moved, you haven't  loved.  One of my all-time favorite movies, a personal discovery.",923184000,5,504,5.073170731707317
433251,5,6302131049,"The Bee Gees sang ""How Do You Mend a Broken Heart?""  This movie, written by the ineffable Beth Henley, seeks to solve the riddle.  Rosanna plays a girl with a broken heart.  Worse she is a town outcast; those in town think she is a bit of a lunatic for having attacked her jerk boyfriend with a fork.  She enrolls in a theater workshop and slowly becomes involved with Eric Roberts, who is a bit of a misfit himself.  Along the way are a lot of true moments, sublime little touches and some wonderful humor.

""To Be or Not to Be is Not Much of a Choice,"" is the town's motto.  Funny throwaway bit but apropos for the riddle of existence these two lovebirds have to solve.  And solve it they do.  It's a wonderful comedy.  Enjoy.",1394496000,,728,4.248175182481752

433257,5,6302131049,"First off,I love anything and everything Rosanna Arquette. She's pretty,funny,sexy without even trying and just a great actress in my opinion. She can do comedy or drama and in this movie she does a little of both. The story has a little bit of everything in it and the romance between Rosanna and Eric Roberts is one of the highlights of it. The two actors have tons of chemistry and you root for them throughout the movie. I loved it and have watched it many times,it's well worth the money to own it!",1359849600,,503,4.419354838709677

I just bought it (scan and pan) on dvd.  This movie is so charming and yet very profound.  The characters are all interesting even if they are on screen for a short period of time.

This movie deserves a dvd upgrade and a retrospective.

Highly recommended.",1315526400,,333,4.306451612903226
433260,3,6302131049,"Eric Roberts was really good in this movie,unfortunatly the same can't be said about Rosanna Arquette. I didn't like her character much but Eric roberts and her had good chemistry. It also had some memorable lines,like ""He just looks at me,stares at me,with these eyes"" wich she brings up again later in the movie and I can see why. Eric Roberts has some peircing eyes that will leave any woman hypnotized. It's a shame. This movie had alot more potential. I say it's worth a rental but not a buy.",1305244800,,497,4.533333333333333

7821999,5,6302131049,"I love, love, love this movie! If I was to have a cult film addiction, this would be the film (Princess Bride would probably be the only other one for me). In the late 80's, I used to watch Nobody's Fool over and over and then, somewhere along the line, I lost my copy (VHS, of course). When I found it on DVD, I watched it with my 20-year-old son (he is an English major in college and loves discussing good books and movies). I was a little nervous that it was going to look dated and that I was going to be wondering what I had ever loved about watching it 25+ years ago. But I was so pleasantly surprised that I still really enjoyed it. And, an even bigger surprise, my son loved it, too! We discussed it afterwards for quite some time. There are scenes in this movie that have stuck with me over the years. My husband and I have frequently referred to the scene with Cassie and her Cousin Linda, ""I got my TV watching suit on"" whenever we are settling in to watch a movie or something for any period of time. I think the scenes that Cassie has with her Cousin Linda are some of the best because Linda is the one in the movie that has been clearly identified with mental illness (although Cassie runs a very close second), but yet Linda is the only one that seems to really see Cassie clearly. There are so many scenes that stand out in this movie. If you like quirky characters (as I do) and movies that don't necessarily follow the usual formula, you should give this one a chance. It is not your typical rom-com and they even weave in a little Shakespeare which gives Cassie an incredible venue to express her true depth and just how much she has outgrown her small hometown.",1406332800,,1682,4.242990654205608
