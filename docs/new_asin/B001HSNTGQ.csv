3643901,5,B001HSNTGQ,"Few films embody the 60's trend in Hollywood for International Productions that could play in any European Market as well as the good old USofA more than this movie.  It is an enchanting concept. The longevity and varied changing ownership of a hand tooled masterpiece of classic automotive technology.  Oh....and the star power isn't too bad either.  The cast has been mentioned by others.  But the Rolls holds its own against the biggest of them and comes out the true central character it was meant to be.  Quite an accomplishment with no dialogue.  There is quite a bit of interaction with the actors themselves, yet the car never lets itself be upstaged.  A finely tuned performance all the way.  Today's cars should enroll in the Yellow Rolls Royce's acting class about class acting through every social strata in a feature film.  I shall never understand why the Academy wasn't driven to nominate it that year.
You really can't go wrong being the next owner of The Yellow Rolls Royce.",1229817600,36,991,4.816568047337278
3643902,4,B001HSNTGQ,"This is one of those enjoyable movies about the history revolving around something. In this case a classic yellow Rolls Royce touring car. Back in 1965 when this movie was made it wasn't unusual to have all star casts for big production movies. This certainly has an excellent cast with George C. Scott, Shirley McClaine, Ingrid Bergman, Rex Harrison, Omar Shariff, and other notables.  It is good to see the stars in this one and the story is pretty decent as well. This is a family movie that most will enjoy. It involves the life stories of three different owners of the car from when it was new to when it is dated. The car although just an automobile they owned intertwines with their lifes and you will feel if it could talk it would have quite a story to tell. The stories are rich in style and color and the Rolls gives rides from VIPs to common soldiers and travels all types of highways and back roads. Good quality DVD with fair replayability, but without any extras. If you enjoyed ""The Red Violin"" you will probably enjoy this movie.

3643903,5,B001HSNTGQ,"At last, this superb film is on dvd. The three separate stories, linked by ownership of the titled Rolls Royce, star the most incredible cast, with standout performances by Rex Harrison as the husband deceived by a delicious Jeanne Moreau, mobster George C Scott and his bored floozie Shirley MacLaine who dallies with Alain Delon, and the final segment with Ingrid Bergman and Omar Sharif, where the Rolls is used for an unexpected purpose. The music and cinematography add to the magic of this film, which should not be missed.

3643947,5,B001HSNTGQ,"If you love the great Hollywood Stars of the the 1960's, you absolutely must see this movie!  What a cast!  The movie is in three segments.  Each segment revolves around the purchase of the same 1930's Yellow Rolls Royce Phantom from pre-World War I through to World War II.  No, this is not a war movie by any means.  It is all about romance.  The first segment stars Rex Harrison (Charles, Marquess of Frinton), Jeanne Moreau (Eloise), and Edmund Purdom (John Fane) as the principal characters of this piece.  The movie opens in England. It is Rex Harrison who purchases the brand new Yellow Rolls Royce off the showroom floor for his French wife, Eloise, as an anniversary present.  Unfortunately, due to the action occurring at the annual Ascot Gold Cup Horse Race, the Yellow Rolls Royce is sent back to the showroom.
The second segment opens in Naples, Italy where the car is up for sale in an Italian showroom.  This segment stars Shirley MacLaine (Mae Jenkins), George C. Scott (Paolo Maltese), Art Carney(Joey Friedlander) and Alain Delon (Stefano )as the principal characters. Scott plays an Anerican gangster, MacLaine is is fiance, and Carney is Scott's trusted right-hand man.  This, I think is my favorite segment.  I remember watching it as a little girl on the Big Screen of my local theater and fell in love with both the movie and Italy! Again, there is ill-fated romance in the Yellow Rolls Royce and once again, the car is left behind.
The last segment stars Ingrid Bergman (Gerda Millett) and Omar Sharif (Davich) and the action takes place at the very beginning of WWII.  It is Trieste and the year is 1941 when we see the Yellow Rolls Royce dusty and discarded until purchased by Ingrid Bergman (playing a bossy, wealthy American widow touring Europe) through a representative.  Ingrid is superb in this piece (really, when was she ever not!)  And this time, with the romance of the characters centering on the automobile, the Yellow Rolls Royce finally finds a home with Gerda Millett! The Yellow Rolls-Royce is a 1964 dramatic composite film written by Terence Rattigan, was produced by Anatole de Grunwald, and directed by Anthony Asquith. This is a must see movie for all people who love the Studio Movies of the 1960's; and want to see movies with great plot lines as well as watching these actors do what they do best!",1410998400,,2347,4.762962962962963

3643949,5,B001HSNTGQ,DVD read properly. An oldie but a goodie,1408060800,,40,4.125
3643950,2,B001HSNTGQ,"There is no movie here, just three vignettes with no point other than to rehash the same Maugham-ish plot over and over as the titular car passes from owner to owner: a relatively happy person, blissful in their ignorance, has their eyes opened to the real stuff of life and must now soldier on with only memories of their one true love. It must have been a lark for the principal actors, many of whom got to travel to some glorious European locations (if watch it you must, watch it in widescreen), but for the viewer it is an ultimately meaningless slog. A lot of money was thrown at this thing, resulting in grand, sumptuous sets, stylish wardrobe, and the aforementioned locations. However, it is filmed like English television shows of the 1960s, mixing real locations with obvious studio sets  within the same scene, in a truly jarring fashion. Art Carney walks past the camera with an impressive view of Florence behind him and then appears to wander onto the set of Gigi. A cavern where Alain Delon takes Shirley MacLaine swimming, allegedly on the Amalfi Coast, looks like they reused the set from Attack of the Crab Monsters. Rex Harrison's car pulls up to his palatial estate and then he gets out of the car in front of a very obvious painted backdrop. Some of the portrayals are cartoonish: George C. Scott plays an American hit man, famous for rubbing people out with a Tommy gun, as if he were guest starring on Get Smart - he even carries a violin case! The last story is the most problematic, being too short to truly develop the change in Ingrid Bergmann's character, or at least provide a back story to explain her instant change from clueless American millionaire to a combination of Florence Nightingale and Modesty Blaise. This last story would have been better off developed into a movie of its own. In any case, we are never given a reason to truly care about these people, and just as you start to, we're off to the next story. So, except for the scenery, the movie is curiously uninvolving. And you'll begin to wonder, as we all did, whether there was any sort of protective coating on the upholstery of that car, considering all the back seat sex going on in there.",1407715200,2,2191,4.589285714285714

3643953,4,B001HSNTGQ,"Just a great, old-fashioned movie with a wonderful cast.  These kinds of movies are usually fun to watch - The VIPs, Love Actually, Grand Hotel, etc. - when the movie maker takes a thing or a place and tells several stories around it.  The thing in this case is a beautiful car.  I actually got a chance to see this car (or one of the several used in the film) several years ago.  It doesn't disappoint.  So there are 3 major stories -  the first with Rex Harrison is the shortest and least interesting.  The second is great and all the players shine - Shirley MacLaine, Alan Delon, Art Carney and George C. Scott - with the local also playing a big part.  The third story is excellent, as well, with Omar Sharif and Ingrid Bergman.  So sit back, relax and let the movie drive you through an enjoyable, satisfying ride.",1405987200,2,819,4.370860927152318

I remembered it all this time, constantly requested it from NetFlix without result, and finally was able to buy my own copy.  My memory was not mistaken, it is really good and worth seeing.  Of course all the stars are much younger here -- a blond young Shirley MacLaine, early-middle aged tough guy George C. Scott, Omar Sharif looking like a college boy, Art Carney seriously soulful -- all the rest including Rex Harrison and Jeanne Moreau, wonderful supporting cast members -- and the car.  One of the lines from the film that has always been part of my set of favorites is when Rex Harrison likes the Y.R.R. but is concerned about the shape of whiskey decanter and whether the seat is the correct length for his wife's seated comfort.

3643974,5,B001HSNTGQ,"The Yellow Rolls-Royce is unusual in two primary respects.  First is an episodic plot, tied together by this vast, colorful machine and the sex that takes place in its curtained back seat, very discreetly, you understand.  This is a comedy, after all.  To that, add a splendid screenplay, and crackerjack acting by a large cast of stars, some of them playing cameo roles.
  The other unusual aspect of this film is the music, melodies and lyrics both.  Seldom for a non-musical can be heard such memorable songs and themes.  Watch: the music will stick in your head.  The main theme is a sort of fanfare for the car itself, but the Italian songs and the manner in which they are performed are wonderful.
  Of the cast, special kudos are due to Ingrid Bergman, Art Carney, Rex Harrison, Shirley MacLaine, George C. Scott, and Omar Sharif, but watch for Wally Cox!  Imagine all those people, and several more stars, together in one film!  Well, not all really together, because they appear in different episodes.

generation that mine""  Today this movie would be filled with expletives almost naked bodies and the intensity stepped up 100 times.  It does not play well at all in my opinion.  Shirley Maclaine is wasted along with George S. Scott with a contrived plot that is totally unbelievable.  Alain Deleon acting as Maclains lover while Scott is away it laughable.  He just screems gay, there is nothing wrong with being gay it's just that it's highly unlikedly
a gay man would fall madly in love with a woman.  Rex Harrison is the most believable.  Ingrid Bergman is cast as a
rich society matron who rents the car in 1941 just as the war in Europe is exploding all around her.  I find her performance, high strung, and nervous bordering on out and out over acting to the point of thinking, Ingrid get a grip you have over done the script

3643988,3,B001HSNTGQ,"I originally saw this movie decades ago but couldn't remember a thing about it so I bought it and watched it again.  Now I know why it was so unmemorable.  Three tales are tacked together, their only connection being the title car, which was not in every scene and really doesn't provide any interest (in and of itself).  The main problem is a makeshift plot that's built around three incomplete stories.  Stories that are trite and obvious, no surprises were applied.  They simply went from sad to awkward to amusing then abruptly stopped.  The End.  I was left wanting more.
I won't say it's a bad film, it's not, it's slick and polished, but it's not a gem, in spite of the stars involved.  Of the three tales, I enjoyed the one starring Ingrid Bergman and Omar Sharif the best.  But the first tale held the greatest chance for depth, then spoilt it by moving the car 20,023 miles later, to Genoa.  I'm afraid this all reminded me of a very long episode of The Love Boat, but with a car instead.
Not a keeper.  But I am glad I saw it (again) if just for Ingrid Bergman, Shirley MacLaine, and Rex Harrison.",1307318400,2,1108,4.4088669950738915

3643992,4,B001HSNTGQ,"Following up his delicious, star-studded ""The V.I.P.'s"", screenwriter Terence Rattigan crafted another fun ensemble piece, THE YELLOW ROLLS-ROYCE (1964), which follows the adventures of said automobile as it travels through three sets of owners.

The story opens in London, where Lord Charles Frinton (Rex Harrison) buys the Rolls-Royce as a belated anniversary gift for his wife Eloise (Jeanne Moreau), but the car comes to symbolise much more, when Charles discovers Eloise cavorting in the backseat with an old colleague (Edmund Purdom) during the Ascot races.

We switch locations to Italy, where vacationing American gangster Paolo Maltese (George C. Scott) finds the car in an auto showroom.  His bleach-blonde moll Mae (Shirley MacLaine) takes an instant liking to it, and when Paolo is called back to the States to attend to ""business"", Mae travels down to the Italian coast, where she has a passionate fling with gigolo Stefano (Alain Delon).

Finally, we meet up with eccentric socialite Gerda Millett (Ingrid Bergman), who is asked by penniless Yugoslavian partisan Davich (Omar Sharif), to be smuggled across the border.  As Gerda and Davich dodge Nazi bullet-fire--with yapping lapdog Duchess in tow--could romance also bloom?

THE YELLOW ROLLS-ROYCE is a rollicking good time.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it; though especially the exciting final story with Ingrid Bergman.  Perhaps because I've developed a renewed fascination for her lately.  She delivers a fun-loving performance, and looks to have had a ball filming her scenes.

There are sadly no extras, apart from the trailer.  I would have loved the inclusion of the original promotional featurette (""The Car That Became a Star""), but just having the movie on DVD is cause for celebration.  Recommended.",1291593600,2,1785,5.381294964028777

3643996,4,B001HSNTGQ,"I was 13 when this movie was first released. I was very excited at the time, it seemed so sophisticated. Now after many years, it was a nice experience to see the film on DVD. Film making has changed dramatically and this film is a great example of the big films of the early 1960s which were filled to overflowing with big name stars in a highly accessible and understandable plot and script. Today the film may seem formulaic, predictable, and somewhat shallow - but it is still highly entertaining. The first part of this tri-part film stars Rex Harrison and Jeanne Moreau as Lord and Lady Frinton. Lord Frinton seems to have missed all the cues that his wife was no longer interested in him and had found a younger lover. Edmund Purdom plays the younger man. The third part of the film stars Ingrid Bergman and Omar Scharif as an American millionaires and a Yugoslavian rebel. This section is a bit far-fetched as this rich spoiled widow becomes a radiant freedom fighter using her yellow Rolls to carry rebels to fight the invading Italians in World War II. The second part of the film is actually the strongest. It is the story of a gangster returning to Italy with his Miami girlfriend, played by Shirley MacLain. She gradually falls for an extremely handsome and charming gigolo, played by Alain Delon. Art Carney is fantastic as the mobster's right-hand man. He is perfect and he, Delon, and MacLain give the best performances in the film.

There are good bits in each of the three typically rueful stories written by Sir. Terrence Rattigan, but none is wholly satisfying.  Similarly, there's a solid cast, but the stars don't deliver really strong work.

The first story finds Rex Harrison as a painfully oblivious diplomat.  This is followed by a more broadly comic tale with George C. Scott and Art Carney as Runyonesque gangsters in Italy, where Alain Delon shows up to romance Scott's moll Shirley McLaine.  (This may be one of Delon's drippiest performances, and all his exterior scenes seem poorly overdubbed.)  The last story is a rousing wartime propaganda piece that's about 20 year passed its sell-by date.  Ingrid Bergman plays the improbably Republican matron who aids a young freedom fighter played by Omar Sharif.  Of all the 50s and 60s  women's picture May-December romances this has to be one of the most convincing as Bergman is gorgeous here.",1235692800,6,1090,5.0055555555555555

I rate it 4 stars because in all honesty, 5 stars implies ""as good as it gets"" and while its wonderful, its obviously not a Citizen Kane or a Bicycle Thief, but that having been said, it was an absolute amust for my collection.

The movie takes you on a tour of europe, from the life of a British Aristocrat, to the italian vacation of an american gangster, to the mountains of WWII era yugoslavia, and its a really wonderful journey. Rex Harrison is simply superb, and british director Asquith's familiarity with Britain and the English aristocracy of the time and its ways, makes the British portion of the movie the most detailed, accurate and authentic, and will entertain anglophiles, but George C Scott, Shirley Maclain, and Ingrid Bergman carry off the rest of it to perfection. They, helped along by the wonderful camera work, the locations and the sensitive story line, really make make for  pleasurable diverting entertainment.

I wish it had been released as a Blu-ray, but for now I am just happy that they finally released this disc.

3644012,5,B001HSNTGQ,"The Yellow Rolls Royce is a class act from the opening credits to the last shot. A pure example of the silver age of Hollywood doing what it does best. Great screenplay by Terrance Rattigan, gorgeous cinematography, engaging score, and impeccable direction by Anthony Asquith add up to a glittering fun and at times truly touching film experience.
  Interestingly enough both Asquith and Rattigan teamed up before for a similar all star romp with the Taylor-Burton film ""The VIPS"" another story of intersecting lives brought together by a mode of transportation. In ""The VIPS"" it was airplanes and here in this charming film it is a resplendent canary yellow automobile.
  To add to this heady cocktail the director has blended in a glittering all star cast of first rate talent from the early 1960's. This is a truly international roster of superstars each of which brings their unique talents and charms to bear on this film.
  The story is in three acts encompassing events some years apart all involving the Rolls and how it came into and changed the lives of its various owners. In act one Rex Harrison is superb as being well, nothing less than Rex Harrison. The glamorous Jeanne Moreau shows her depth and considerable strengths as his wandering but loving wife. They sparkle and spark as an aristocratic English couple facing a major turning point in their marriage.
  Act two really pops with comic genius flavored with a moving drama as Gangster George C. Scott takes his wisecracking Moll, Shirley MacLaine on a tour of Italy. Scott is revelatory in his roll and is complemented by Art Carney as his loyal and street wise right hand man. MacLaine channels a sharp, witty comic performance that stands with her best of the period. And as the amoral gigolo Stefano who opens her heart to real love and a love of life Alain Delon shines.  They make a stunningly beautiful screen couple and by the end of the act they pluck the strings of star crossed romance beautifully.
  The luminous Ingrid Bergman teams up with Omar Sharif in a romantic tale set at the outbreak of the invasion of Yugoslavia during World War II. Bergman brings to the film a beauty that is timeless and her star persona which is legendary. She is brittle, vain at first, and funny. But with the aid of freedom fighter Sharif she comes to a new understanding of sacrifice and true humanity amidst the tragedy of war.
  And all throughout the films we are treated with spectacular vistas and sights of Europe in a travelogue of breathtaking cinemascope grandeur. The excitement of he Ascot races, the lush seductive beauty of Italy and the rough magnificence of the mountains of Yugoslavia.
  ""The Yellow Rolls Royce"" is much more than a star vehicle, it is the distillation of great filmmaking in a long gone era that both entertains and inspires the heart of all true romantics.",1233187200,23,2858,4.780487804878049
