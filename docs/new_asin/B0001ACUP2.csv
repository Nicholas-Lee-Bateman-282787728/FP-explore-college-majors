8009104,5,B0001ACUP2,Liza at her best. The routine with Arthur in the afternoon was funny and well chorographed. A must for liza fans,1358812800,,112,4.380952380952381
8009105,5,B0001ACUP2,"This is a concert Liza did in New Orleans. But, the VHS transfer is better than the DVD. So, I had someone transfer the VHS to DVD and it worked. A clear copy of her earlier performances. I hope she will have someone redo it, as she is shown as the owner of the program. Fred Ebb wrote her songs and Halston did her wardrobe. The sparkly dress was also worn in the Detroit Concert with Sammy Davis, Jr., and Frank Sinatra. All her concerts are collectibles, but not always put on DVD by the best persons to do the work. They should be on Blu Ray. That would be a treat.",1351382400,,569,4.089285714285714
8009106,5,B0001ACUP2,"I have not seen this tape.  But, I have the ""Liza at Carnegie Hall"" which was recorded in 1979 and was done during the same tour.  It's great.  Now, a website called ""Dress Circle"" (out of the UK) plans to release this on DVD (all regions) on 02/21/2011.  I do not know if it's the hour version that was once released on VHS or if the entire concert has been restored to the DVD.  Unfortunately, they don't give a track listing.

Here are the tracks from the album released at the time:

How Long Has This Been Going On / It's a Miracle
My Ship / The Man I Love
Some People
Come In From the Rain
London Town
New York Medley
Someone to Watch Over Me / 12 Fellas
You and I / The Honeymoon is Over / Happy Anniversary
City Lights
Cabaret
Shine On Harvest Moon
But the World Goes Round / Bows",1297987200,,788,4.04516129032258
8009107,5,B0001ACUP2,"this was an outstanding concert caught on film and I agree with the previous post, one of the best liza ever did. If you had the great thrill of seeing her in concert back in the 70's or 80's this is definitive. I also agree that the vhs out there now is incomplete and missing a number of great moments including shine on harvest moon (which brought the house down in boston) and a few others. There really should be a restored, full-length dvd for this show. it was spectacular!!",1271548800,,481,4.355555555555555
8009108,5,B0001ACUP2,"This show was done in 1981 on HBO I believe, and I think it was one of her best.  I don't think VCRs even existed back then and if they did they were just coming out.  I was so blown away by the show though that I taped the music on a cassette and played it until it was worn out.  I've been looking for this for quite awhile and finally found one I could afford.  It's just as good as I recall, but be warned that part of the original show has been edited out making this video just under one hour long.  I love the song ""City Lights"", but the lead-in to it which is what makes it as entertaining as it is has been cut out as has the song ""Mr. Cellophane"" which was done by one of the young men who shared the stage with her for this show.  I would love to see this released on DVD in its complete and uncut version.",1266624000,2,817,3.8333333333333335
8009109,5,B0001ACUP2,"after viewing this concert tape several times and enjoying it much each time I must say that this is superb from start to finish..if youve seen either of Liza at Radio City or Liza with a Z, I put this on equal footing with those two..as usual I won't do a song by song review of this but heres some favorites..the lady walks onto the stage..then begins ""how long has this been going on?""..she incorporates a couple of other tunes into this one and then it becomes ""how long has this miracle been going on?""..""the man I love"" is wonderful and absolutely beautiful is ""come in from the rain""..the very funny ""Arthur in the afternoon""..that song has nothing to do with the movie Arthur which she did around the time this show took place in case you were wondering..later on is a medley of old New York classics topped by a stunning version of ""New York, New York""..then the wonderful ""city lights"" and ""cabaret""..this version of ""cabaret"" has a nice little introduction that is in keeping with the movie..the end song is ""but the world goes round"" and it is my favorite of the different times Ive heard sing this number..also i forgot to include a song sung earlier in the show about a ship setting in..thats all i got on that last tune..a very good slow tune I am not sure of the name of that one..as i mentioned all in all this is a wonderful five star show..id give it fifty stars in fact if that were possible..i dished out a fair price for this being the loyal fan of Liza that I am..i suppose it must be harder to find then others..but the price really wasn't an issue cause i looked at it like this..say you went to see the lady live in person..youd spend a little more then what you would spend on this..although going to an actual show is a much different experience then watching it on a television chances are you still wouldnt have the luxury of being able to view the show you had tickets for over and over in the comfort of your living room..this show is from New Orleans in 1980..i don't think I mentioned that..Thank You..",1257033600,,2036,4.417553191489362
8009110,5,B0001ACUP2,"Yes she hit her peak during this period, not during the Cabaret years.  After watching this video you will see why I say that -- her beauty, dancing, and most of all her rich voice were just great.  My favorite numbers were (are) ""Cabaret,"" ""New York, New York,"" ""City Lights,"" and most of all ""The Man I Love."" This video shows me why she was considered the premier live entertainer and singer of her period--before the days of Madonna .... way back when :)",1188691200,3,458,4.440476190476191
8009111,5,B0001ACUP2,"It was wonderful when the 1972 TV special ""Liza With a Z"" was so beautifully restored and converted to DVD ... yes, Liza was at her prime then, having just won the Oscar for ""Cabaret"" ... but in all honesty, THIS is the video taped concert that is the best of the best.  Hopefully it will also be updated and appear on DVD...and HOPEFULLY with those missing numbers, which were so tremendous, retrieved and included.

Liza Minnelli was truly at the Top of the Heap these nine years after ""Z"" had been televised.  Those years had brought her just enough more vocal power, more confidence, more ""learning experiences"" to add a luster to both her acting and singing abilities that has never been matched by any other entertainer to this day.

Her ""Come in from the Rain"" will break your heart and bring tears to your eyes just as it did her own on that New Orleans stage.  This video contains the best version of ""But the World Goes 'Round"" ever recorded, just shaking the rafters...and you will have to start laughing watching what the Legend does with ""Arthur in the Afternoon.""  ""An Evening With Liza Minnelli"" also contains her definitive versions of ""City Lights"" and ""Cabaret,"" not to mention the concert opener ""Blue Skies.""

If you know Someone who knows Someone who knows Someone, please urge them to convey the message that this masterpiece deserves to be, should be, must be restored and converted to DVD...ASAP!  But in the meantime, I notice there are only 3 or 4 used copies of this VHS tape left here on Amazon as I write...and they are extremely expensive...but if you can possibly afford one, don't let a classic like this slip away from you.",1183248000,6,1656,4.647260273972603
8009112,5,B0001ACUP2,"This is a definite must-have: Filmed in New Orleans, this is the concert that Liza rocked Carnegie Hall with in 1979. She is absolutely in top form- my only regret is that the show has been edited down to only one hour, when the entire concert should have been released as a 2-tape set.  Well worth the price!",1125360000,2,309,4.327586206896552
8009113,5,B0001ACUP2,"this is a wonderful evening with Liza, she was supurb, enjoyed the entire time of watching her, for anyone who addores Liza Minnelli  this is a got to have. Terri Cooksey",1120694400,2,170,4.483870967741935
