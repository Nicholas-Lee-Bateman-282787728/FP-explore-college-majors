8495331,5,B0069J0PJW,"There was absolutely no reason after his fantastic debut in ONG BAK that Tony Jaa wouldn't be up for more roles. TOM YUM GOONG is the quasi-sequel to ONG BAK, and as one reveiwer has observed, this is of VCD like picture quality. But anyone who has seen Tony in action knows that won't stop any true martial arts fan from grabbing a copy of TOM YUM GOONG.

Plotwise, TOM YUM GOONG is the same movie as ONG BAK, only Tony's character is named Kham, the ONG BAK buddha's head is replaced with two elephants from Kham's village, the movie takes place in Sydney, Australia instead of Bankok, and a handful of the dialouge is in English. They've even brought Tony ONG BAK co-star Petchtai Wongkamlao in as a Sydney cop.

Okay, so that's the plot. Nothing GONE WITH THE WIND-ish. But the film certainly doesn't lack in action. There are a number of great fights in TOM YUM GOONG. The first, when Kham storms into a local poacher station demanding to know where his elephants have been taken. The warehouse fight, featuring Tony jumping into (and kicking his pursuers out of) subway cars, executing backflips and sumersaults to evade his dirt bike ridin' enemys.

The next action scene may be one of the best ones. It is a continuous single shot of Tony climbing up a circular staircase and crushing succesive waves of evildoers to get to the top. This GAME OF DEATH style-battle is immediately followed by a resturant brawl with of the bad guys Wushu-trained henchmen.

Then Tony takes on a Capoeira expert in the sahllow pool inside a Buddhist temple. The is arguably the best one-on-one match Tony has put out. He soon after faces a hulking henchmen named T.K., played by pro-wrestler Nathan Jones, who ultimately defeats Tony.

Finally, we come to the big showdown. As is typical of these movies, the main showdown is preceded with a prelimenary showdown in which the villian (or in this case, villainess)sends out God know's how many henchmen to stop the hero, to no avail. This scene, clearly inspired by Bruce Lee's classic cave sequence in ENTER THE DRAGON, has Tony crippling what must be at least three dozen guys with a combination of throws, bone-cracking joint locks, and high, aerial spinning kicks. After finishing with them, Tony faces his big rematch with T.K.

Bottom line: TOM YUM GOONG is Tony Jaa signing in blood that he is ready to be Jet Li's successor. If anyone felt that Tony would not be able to live up to his own standards after ONG BAK, TOM YUM GOONG will put all that to rest.",1135728000,,2501,4.621621621621622
8495332,1,B0069J0PJW,"Well, the above tells it all - this DVD has only 3.83 Gb of MPEG2 video(half than normal for DVD) which makes this otherwise excellent movie a real pain to watch - persistent pixelation, dropped frames here and there, and judjing by the sound and overused worn-out VHS-like picture ""quality"" this DVD ""edition"" has been camcordered who-knows where. Welcome to one of the worst knock-offs I've ever seen - so much because costs about 10 USD to get it and it's one of these discs that go straight in the trash bin after 110 min of cursing.

CONCLUSION: WAIT FOR EUROPEAN UNCUT TRULY OFFICIAL EDITION -",1134518400,3,599,4.650943396226415
8495333,5,B0069J0PJW,This movie is probably the best martial arts movie I've seen in the longest time.  THe fight scences are incredible. If you liked Ong Bak or Born to Fight then you are going to love this Movie. Tony Jaa kicks more ass in this movie alone than Jet Li and Jackie Chan combined in most their movies. In one fight scene he beats up more than 50 guys back to back each in a unique way. THIS IS A MUST SEE movie for any Martial arts fan.,1134259200,,431,3.954022988505747
