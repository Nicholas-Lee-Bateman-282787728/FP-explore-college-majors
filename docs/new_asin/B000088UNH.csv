1831510,5,B000088UNH,"I bought this vid, not because i'm a ballet fan, but because one of the dancers is Ukrainian, as am i, & i like to collect all things Uke. So i watched. And i was hooked. This is compelling. The guys are intelligent & athletic & fun & cool. I understand better now what ballet is all about. This vid is a huge success.",1046304000,4,318,3.984375
1831520,5,B000088UNH,"I have loaned this DVD to friends to share this powerful film and it has touched everyone.  One friend was so excited she will be purchasing a copy for herself. If you have any interest in dance, in whatever style, this is a 'must see'.",1237766400,,236,4.2444444444444445
1831521,5,B000088UNH,"These men are just splendid, and what dancers! The physical training has come so far. I know Corella is the current hearthrob of ABT, and though he's a great dancer, and very handsome in a young-man, open-faced way, the standout for me by far was Carreno, who is a very strong and masculine Cuban-born dancer with a stage presence that can't be denied, even though he never resorts to be mugging to the audience for approval. He's an incredibly powerful dancer, and my oh my, he's built like a god. He reminds me in his bearing of the great, if underappreciated, Fernando Bujones.

The last time I saw a live performance by this company, Kevin McKenzie was still dancing (he was good, too! Don't listen to what he says!). So I have been out of it. ABT has definitely BROUGHT it in the last few years.
I'm really happy to see anything that is good for ballet. And this is definitely more than good.

Valodia, the catlike dancer from the Ukraine, tells the sad story of his lonely childhood at ballet school alone in Russia, and of his mother, who did without to pay for his room and board (as a dancer from the Ukraine, he was apparently considered a second-class citizen by the Bolshoi School administration, and he didn't get the same perks Russian dancers got for free).

After being denied a place in the Bolshoi Ballet upon graduation, he went out on his own and won two big competitions. At that point the Bolshoi vouchsafed to make him an offer, whereupon Valodia told them that it was too late (which must have been sweet). The Bolshoi's loss is our gain. I've never seen any male dancer with the flexibility and a three-dimensional way of moving that this dancer has.

There are a lot of non-dance moments, but there is enough dance to make this definitely worth seeing.",1231113600,3,1778,4.564263322884012
1831522,5,B000088UNH,"My son was a dance student who ultimately gave it up, largely I think because of the constant ragging he got from his peers in middle school. It's difficult for a young guy to stand up to that kind of pressure; having to change in the men's room at the studio because he's the only boy and there's no men's dressing room, etc - so ANYTHING we can give our dancing guys to help them feel good about themselves is a plus. This video provides really tremendous moral support for young men interested in the arts. Several reviews mentioned the ""normalcy"" that the video seems aimed at portraying. I think honestly that that is its best feature; to normalize the idea of men dancing, to remove the stigma, and to make the idea accessible. It's certainly not a dance video in the strictest sense, but rather an educational tool. If I ran a dance studio and was trying to recruit young men, this would be something I'd show at elementary and middle schools, to prospective students. It's a friendly inside view of a world that most young men have no contact with, that makes it case for dancing as a ""manly"" art on the astonishing athleticism of the dancers. Very educational, in many senses. I recommend it highly.",1218326400,5,1208,4.545871559633028
1831523,3,B000088UNH,"Originally made in 2004 for PBS' ""Dance In America"" series, this 58-minute documentary intertwines the personal stories of American Ballet Theater's reigning danseurs with the creation of a Mark Morris ballet showcasing their abundant talents. Although they come from very different backgrounds (from the Ukraine, Cuba, Spain and the US) and training, their stories are a testament to their passion for dance and debt to Baryshinov. The personal stories go to lengths to establish them as ""regular"" guys (Ethan Stiefel seems 'married' to his Harley Davidson) but the film include great footage of these dancers early years and triumphs and interesting comments from the teachers and parents whose sacrifices paved their way for their sons' successes. The brief Morris ballet (to Schumann) is an apt and joyful conclusion.",1194998400,4,821,5.421875
1831524,5,B000088UNH,These 4 dancers are just magic! To see FOUR such fabulous male dancers in the one company at the one time is astounding. I have been attending Ballet performances and films for over 40 years and I am still saying Wow! Please have more films of dancers of this calibre. I don't think I will be able to afford to come to the U.S.A. to see them in person!,1171929600,,352,4.115942028985507
1831525,5,B000088UNH,"Anyone who appreciates performances by the exuberant and breath-taking ANGEL CORELLA will love this DVD. Along with his three ABT colleagues, Jose Manuel Carreo, Ethan Stiefel, and Vladimir Malakhov, viewers are taken through a real rehearsal by Mark Morris while being shown interviews and photos from the lives of all four dancers!  WOW, I just loved it.",1142208000,,356,5.245614035087719
1831526,5,B000088UNH,"American Ballet Theatre director Kenneth McKenzie (a former dancer himself) knows how to find, encourage, and showcase great male dancers. The four featured here are a diverse group from the current crop of principals. McKenzie seems to look to Spain and Latin America for a certain kind of fiery performer (Angel Corella from Spain and Jose Manuel Carreno from Cuba represent this group here). Russians, who once dominated the ballet stage, are represented here by Vladimir Malakhov (from the Ukraine). Ethan Stiefel (the heart-breaker star of ballet-pic ""Center Stage"") is the sole American.
This film is a documentary with a short dance performance appendix. Each dancer is filmed on his home turf and speaks about the importance of his family and country of origin. Nothing too revealing here. Short clips from auditions and key roles do give the viewer a sense of the unique performance styles of each of these dancers. The dance ""appendix"" is a short work choreographed by Mark Morris to a Schumann piano quintet (mercifully, not to the rock standard ""Born to Be Wild"").
The only annoying thing about this short film is that it seems to feel the need to defend the masculinity of male dancers. Didn't Edward Villella address that issue once and for all in ""Prodigal Son""? My advice is to ignore the rhetoric and just enjoy the great dancing!",1086566400,25,1347,4.964601769911504
1831527,4,B000088UNH,"I must admit to some disappointment in this DVD; not because of the quality of the content but rather the content itself.  Also, this disc is short, very short...only 54 minutes in fact
This DVD features four of the male stars of todays American Ballet Theatre: That being, Jose Manuel Carreno (Cuba), Angel Corella (Spain), Vladimir Malakhov (Russia) and Ethan Stiefel (USA).
I'd expected some extended video of each of the dancers actually dancing, but instead the bulk of the video is more of less a mini biography of each of the dancers with brief snippets of each of them from  previous shows they were in.
There is also an extended section showing them rehearsing a dance, a pas de quatre, danced to Scubert's piano quintet; the finished work is about 7 minutes long and shown at the very end of the disc.  This was well done and performed before a live audience.
I think the highlight of this disc, to me, was a short segment of each of them on a trampoline, with a single photograph frame capturing some spectacular aerial pose at the apex of their leaps. Unbelievable height and agility.
All in all, not quite what I expected when I purchased this DVD. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy it, I did, (getting some insight on the lives of these fabulously talented individual was very interesting,  but it's just not something that I'd probably watch more than once. And watching some of my favorite choreographed dances is something that I do watch on a regular and repeated basis.",1086393600,42,1493,4.643939393939394
1831528,5,B000088UNH,"Born to Be Wild documents the lives and work of four American Ballet Theatre dancers: Angel Corella, Vladimir Malakov, Hose Manuel Carreno, and Ethan Steifel.
Four different men from four different backgrounds...Watch how the beauty and thrill of ballet brought them all to the same place: American Ballet Theatre, one of the world's greatest ballet companies. Woven among the riveting stories of how they became some of the best male dancers in the world are clips of their phenomenal dancing at various points in their careers. At the end, you're treated to their performance of a dance specially commissioned for the documentary!
If you already are a ballet fan, don't miss this! If you aren't, watch it and be prepared to be hooked! This documentary is sure to really change what many people think of ballet!",1048118400,17,812,4.977941176470588

7980634,4,B000088UNH,"Despite a growing number of ballet performance DVDs, ballet dancers, and especially male ballet dancers, are largely a mystery. This work is a welcome addition to behind-the-scene TV and film documentaries about them, although the 54-min moderate length leaves one a little bit underwhelmed. Regarding the work itself, stories of the four men were told roughly one by one, with interval cuts of the others that seemed somehow weird. Highlights, albeit mostly standard staff, include their own comments on this art form, their performance footage in the past and the BTS photo shoot. However, the dance in the end, in my opinion, is not particularly exciting.",1430697600,,658,5.216981132075472
7980635,5,B000088UNH,"Time well spent and wanting repeating -- once the bios are learned there is so much delight in seeing form, energy, and dedication.  Just the final segment, alone, of a complete presentation of a dance created by Mark Morris is worth the expense.  No disappointments!",1389225600,,267,4.911111111111111

7980637,5,B000088UNH,"""Born to be Wild"" was part of the great TV series ""Dance in America"". Although only one hour long, it is so well conceived and edited that it feels far longer, in the best sense. Featuring 4 great ABT dancers (Carreno, Corella, Malakhov, and Stiefel), the focus of the hour is actually on the creation of a ballet for them by renowned choreographer Mark Morris. Thus, it is not your usual ballet film of long dance pieces, but instead is composed of 4 segments showing us the dancers' backgrounds, both here and in their home countries (and which contain excellent vignettes of each in prior roles), and extensive footage of their work with Morris as he creates an exquisite work for them, which is shown in its entirety at the end.

It is a video I find I can watch over and over for there is no extraneous word or image. If you are interested in not just dance but the creative process, you will really like this DVD.",1361318400,,919,4.437869822485207
7980638,4,B000088UNH,Is short film but fun to watch... really good stuff.. especially if you are a Male dancer .. we are going to love it... those 4 dancers will give us a bit of inspiration and motivation to keep it going on this ballet biz... =]..,1302393600,,228,4.088888888888889
7980639,5,B000088UNH,"These extraordinary male dancers seem to enjoy their dancing to the utmost and, therefore, communicate that enjoyment to the viewer.  I have watched this dvd several times with pleasure.
I enjoyed their mini biographies, the rehearsals, and the ballet created for them, the music as well as the choreography.
Fifty years ago there were very few male dancers, great, good, or even mediocre. Today, they seem to be coming up at a steady rate, but these four are at the top of their class.",1280880000,,486,4.785714285714286
7980640,5,B000088UNH,"Of course this are not the current ""leading men"". Still, if you are a balletomane as I am, you will love to watch these beautiful guys doing what they do best. They are all super stars of the ballet world and having seen them dance, one can see why that is true. Plus, it is nice to have a bit of their history as well - how they grew up, why they chose to be a ballet dancer ( or it chose them) and watch a dance choreographed, rehearsed and performed.

I wish there were more ballet DVD's  like this available.",1271376000,,512,4.0594059405940595
7980641,5,B000088UNH,"This DVD has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I have been so disappointed that there are few ballets on DVD that have been produced within the last 5 years.  I bought this DVD because I wanted to see what the ABT has produced since the year 2000 in the form of dancers.

These 4 men are fantastic.  I know for sure one of them was trained by Mikhail Baryshnikov...I think Ethan Steifel.  All 4 men are absolutely terrific dancers not to mention heart throbs with Jose actually taking your breath away with his dancing and masculinity.

This DVD is a documentary NOT a ballet although it has a short dance routine at the end of the DVD showing the 4 men together.
I""m sure it was made to introduce to us the 4 new male dancers
with ABT  It helped me to determine if they are dancers I really want to spend my money on and the short clips showing their dancing ability in the ballets they were in proved to me that it definitely wouldn't be wasted money.  I've already bought ""Le Corsaire"" with 3 of them performing (just arrived in the mail yesterday) and Center Stage with Ethan Steifel which is a movie about ballet dancers not a ballet.  Very great performance by Ethan.

I know I would not have bought Center Stage before I saw what Ethan could do.  I doubt very much if I could go wrong with buying anything that these 4 men are in as ""Born to be Wild"" shows us how incredibly talented they are.

The documentary is acutally out of date already as it was made in 2002 ...7 years ago. I think one of them has left ABT.  However, unlike the lady that said she won't watch it again, I know I will watch it many times just so I can see these amazing dancers both off stage and on stage.  There really does need to be more current ballets available for purchase.
