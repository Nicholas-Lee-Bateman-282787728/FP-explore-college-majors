3535416,5,B001DOBH40,"I received Paranormal State Season 1 as a Christmas present and
when I started watching it, I couldn't stop!
If you are interested in the paranormal, this show is a must see!
I'm very impressed with PRS. I really appreciate the compassion and respect they have for the families. They help them understand what is happening.....and why. I pre-ordered Season 2 from Amazon,it arrived friday and I watched it over the weekend. The last episode, I AM SIX, TOTALLY FREAKED MY THE #@$@ OUT!!!
Also, I really hope Michelle Belanger will come back for a few more shows.

Then a few years later I was able to watch and view all season on Netflix in 2010 but I never had a chance to watch Season 5 until now in 2015 on Amazon stream.  I'm a big fan and really like the documentary show with the characters (original Pen State team) and all their interesting paranormal cases, but now that I finally had the chance to watched all of Season 5, I was extremely disappointed in (Episode 21 ""If I Should Die"") with the New Class/ new Pen State team. None of them look like or sounded like they had any kind of paranormal experience, or they didn't even provided any kind of entertaining value.  Thank god A&E did not produce another season with the New Pen State team.  Please bring back the original team, please add a new season starting in 2015 or 2016.

For me, no other can compare to the sincerity of this team to help, really help the people that asked for help. Not just showed up with equipment and said ""yes you have problems"" and left. They brought in the best armed forces a person could ever ask for, Chip, Michell, father Bob Bailey, and the famous Loraine Warren...and this show was faked, rehearsed. Give me a break. I was married to a cop, and one thing I learned is how to tell when someone is lying. If you do you may get away with it once or twice, but you can't pull it off forever. It's all in the face, and not always what you do or don't say. I don't care how good of an actor you are, you could not pull off concern, sincerity, and that committment for over 5 seasons.....I will forever miss that show, but now I can savor it forever.",1346544000,,967,4.094736842105263

I am constantly trying to recruit friends and family to watch it with me. Not to scare them but to prove Ryan Buell and his team are out there to help the client first and then try to contact anything supernatural. Also that they actually care about the clients well being and not money puts it that much further up on my list. Oh who am I kidding? Paranormal State is my number one show! It's just utterly amazing!",1288310400,,523,4.24
3535457,1,B001DOBH40,"Before you buy this I suggest doing the following:

1. Google ""Paranormal state fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.

2. Read about the two former clients that have come forward with claims of fraud Episodes ""The Messenger"" and ""Hell House"" I believe. One of their former clients is a self proclaimed psychic. However before you dismiss her complaints as trying to get ""15 minutes more of fame"" read the whole story. She was one of the clients in a episode called "" The Messenger"".
This episode had so much evidence that was, let's just say, unfavorable to PRS's credibility that this episode, despite been listed by Amazon as being on the second DVD of Season Two, had been removed from the DVD and you will NOT find it anywhere on Season Two. The unhappy client posted small parts of that episode on YouTube. All the posts were quickly removed for ""legal reasons"", despite the fact that other episodes on YouTube have not been as closely guarded by the producers of PRS.

3. A lot of evidence (to say the least) has surfaced showing that Chip Coffey is briefed well in advance and in great detail by the producers about all the facts on the cases before every showing up on the set. These are the exact same facts he will later use his ""psychic"" powers to sense.

4. If you search the IMDB website on Chip Coffey, you will find out that he is, and has been, a professional actor all of his life.

5. An entire website has been devoted to exposing PRS as frauds, using their own EVP's and video footage. 1. Google ""Paranormal state fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.

3535458,4,B001DOBH40,"The stories in each of the 12 episodes are good and the ""extras"" are also quite interesting.  There is a problem, however.  Most likely due to poor editing, there is a lag between visual and audio which is disconcerting unless the viewer is only paying partial attention.  The audio and video are a bit out of sync; perhaps that's why Season Two is so difficult to locate - the problem was only detected after the video had been released and the distribution company pulled/recalled as many of the copies as possible (at least that's my guess).  If they can correct the problem and make the ""revised"" version available, it should be as popular as Seasons One and Three.",1276128000,,669,4.6440677966101696

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

""Paranormal State"" also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

3535461,5,B001DOBH40,"There are many supernatural/spiritual shows out there, such as: A Haunting, Ghost Hunters, and Paranormal Destinations to name a few. But Paranormal State is in my opinion the best show of its kind. I consider myself to be a believing skeptic, in that while I believe in the paranormal, I am skeptical about these types of shows. Just because I believe in it, does not mean that I believe every ghost story/show I hear or see. In fact, because of my firm belief, I am less likely to believe most stories I hear.
The first episode of Paranormal State that I saw had me hooked. The shows host Ryan Buell, seems authentic, and very knowledgeable about things of the paranormal. I was very surprised to see the way Buell handled things as they unfolded before him. Also I like that the show neither embraces nor dismisses any one faith, (religion) but rather keeps an open mind. Also the fact that the show protects its viewers really caught my attention. There was an episode where the father of a haunted family kept saying out loud the name of the demon that tormented him. For the show, they bleeped the name out. This is because you're not supposed to say a demons name out loud unless you're ready to do battle with it. Buell is also protective of his team. When things start to get too heated, he'll send the less experienced members of the team away.
Another thing that makes this show great is that they don't just get rid of the ghost or demon, or whatever it may be, but they also help to empower the families and stay in-touch with them. Bottom line, this is a great show!",1252713600,6,1580,4.470588235294118

3535465,2,B001DOBH40,"While I enjoyed the first season and the second season just as much, the third was good, but after that it got ridiculous. Buell's grand standing and BEGGING for camera time, ACTING DRAMATICALLY, ppppffft to that!  Buell seems like a man who REALLY likes adulation and also seems to enjoy being the center of attention. I've since read other reports of fraud, fakery and just plain ol' lying in regards to the show. I do believe funky stuff happens that can't be explained, but to lie about it is just plain annoying and hurtful to the clients and those who believe they have a serious problem. Take the 'I am six' episode.  That came across as laughable. The chick, Laura, was SCREAMING for attention and pyschiatric care, and was destroying her family in the process. BUT, the family is just as much to blame as they were filling in the PS group saying they saw her being suspended in mid air and so on...um, ok. The chick seemed to have an almost smile' on her face while being interviewed.  Then theyw ent back for a second episode, more Buell grand standing trying to pick her up off the bed while yelling, ""let her go!!'. While being 'exorcised' she sounded not ferocious but waif like, and she almost looked like she was going to burst out laughing at times.  oops!  In the first one the family said she stopped breathing and it took them almost an hour to get her to breathe again...SHE'D BE DEAD!  Hello!  WAY over the top and unbelieveable.

I ALSO found out that writing on skin is something you can easily do, AND there IS a medical condition called dermatologic urticaria.  Lay mens terms?  Skin writing.  I had a client who had that condition and you can actually write on the skin like a marker on a white board. Clear and crisp. It's a MEDICAL condition and they didn't even explore that avenue.

Whether Chip Coffy is a legit psychic, many say NO that he's a professional actor and is completely briefed on ALL the information before coming into a case. Google I am six fraud and click on ghost theory for more on that. Lorraine Warren, sweet little old lady, famous for the Amityville horror case...um, I wouldn't toute that too loud. That case has been debunked time and time again and the Lutz's basically admitted they lied b/c of finances and to make a fast buck off the Defaeo murders. Sooooo.....I don't give much credibility to this show anymore. A fun ride if you wanna spook yourself out, but don't take everything too seriously....I believe there ARE things out there to explore, but I think PS is possibly full of BS.

Just my opinion, you don't have to like it, comment on it or whatever.",1238889600,4,2618,4.54468085106383
3535466,5,B001DOBH40,"'Paranormal State' was introduced to me via DVD, shortly after season one arrived in stores.
As another viewer noted, once you start watching, you can't stop.
I was highly impressed, and eagerly awaiting season two, which was released in late January.

The series continues with some truly eerie episodes, notably a haunted horse ranch & a discarded voodoo doll that haunts it's previous owners with an unshakable curse.

Ryan Buell conducts himself as highly intelligent, highly curious & sympathetic to the unfortunate souls involved in the various hauntings.
Buell is also very straight-forward, and able to detect how believable some of the paranormal scenarios really are, by way of interviews with the clients.

Buell's team, though not quite as engaging or driven as he is, are also extremely likeable and entertaining.
Chip Coffey, also returns, with his own unique perspective on the troubled spirits that may (or may not) inhabit various locations.
The overall production is fantastic, and offers a true sense of the experiences felt by the Paranormal Research team.
Authentic sounds are also captured, leading to a few stunned responses by the investigators.

Season two offers twelve half-hour episodes in a two disc set.
The extras are minimal, but with a program of such high quality, the various chapters speak for themselves.

Amazon is offering an excellent price for this series, so i highly recommend the curious viewer pick this one up!",1235779200,5,1456,5.205128205128205
