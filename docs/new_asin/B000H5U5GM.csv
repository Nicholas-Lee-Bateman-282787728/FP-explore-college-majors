2626950,5,B000H5U5GM,This is the movie that started it all with the Mighty Morphen Power Ranger Series. I remember the first time I saw this. It was very entertaining. So if you are looking for a fun movie to see this is it. Thank you.,1217203200,,214,4.0
2626951,2,B000H5U5GM,"Welcome to the worst costume party your communtity college drama class has ever thrown.  Super Inframan is everything that you expect it to be by looking at the cover and the title.  A man is chosen to undergo physical alterations to stop the world from being taken over by Princess Dragon Mom and her eclectic group of monsters... rubber costumes, paper mache props, ridiculous logic and scenarios, awful dialogue and acting, incredibly dated effects, it's all well represented here.  Normally this type of movie would be right up my alley, so why didn't it win me over this time?  I think the problem is that although the movie is bad, you can tell everyone involved cared and put enough effort into it to raise it above z-grade shlock (it is a Shaw Bros. picture).  In fact, for 1975 the movie is actually kinda good (in a really bad way... confused yet?).  While I was hoping for a complete and utter piece of garbage filled with unintentional laughs, what I got instead was a mildly entertaining exercise in below average monster movie film making?  I'd compare this to a Power Rangers marathon as it seems like alot of fun at first but shortly after it begins you realize the error in your judgement and change the channel.  Obviously by looking at all the other positive reviews, this movie provides enough charm and entertainment to appeal to some and I can understand that... it's the little Shaw Bros. ""Ultraman"" clone that could after all (maybe I just wasn't in the right mood?).  All of Image Entertainments Shaw Brothers releases have fantastic picture and sound and this one is no different.",1192579200,5,1606,4.748201438848921
2626952,5,B000H5U5GM,"This is a great transfer of a great scienvce fiction/kung-fu action monster movie. IT is so filled with wall to wall action that it borders on insane. I remember seeing TV spots for this film in 1977. It has these cool cyborg type villains who shoot mace-like projectiles on springs from their arms. Inframan himself bounces around and does flips and cartwheels as though HE is on springs. A horrible pan and scan VHS tape was released in the early eighties. This DVD has a fantastic picture and is in widescreen. So you won't miss any of the action. The english dubbed track is lifted from that earlier theatrical/video release. It was recorded by Titan sound Inc. and you can hear the voices of Ultraman regulars like Peter Fernandez of Speed Racer. This is really the original Chinese cut of the film, so the animated american opening credit sequence is not here to be seen. This is a shame since it is an improvement over the bland chinese titles. It should have been included as an extra. But, basically, this is the best way to see Inframan. I believe the ""INFRA"" in Inframan is short for ""infra-red"". There was a lot of research into this at the time. Inframan's costume is red. And there was an Ultraman spin-off character called Redman in the early seventies, so it all kinda ties in.",1173398400,11,1293,4.6017316017316015
2626953,5,B000H5U5GM,"I am not normally compelled to write reviews for products or movies online, but when I found out this movie had been released on Region 1 DVD I absolutely HAD to buy it.  This disk is so much better than I had imagined I thought I'd spread the word.  I never thought in my wildest dreams that a beautiful widescreen print of this 1975 Chinese film with the original bizarre Peter Fernandez-produced English dub would ever hit North America.  Thankfully I have finally been proven wrong!  Previously only available as a Region 3 disk and VCD, this movie singlehandedly caused me to buy a region-free DVD player.  Heavily influenced by Japan's ""Ultraman"" and ""Masked Rider"" television series, this cult classic has everything you need: motorcycles, monsters, martial arts, a cyborg superhero and a frenetic pace.  The movie is almost non-stop action and is suitable for just about all ages.  One word of warning to parents--this disk contains literally dozens of trailers (and other extra goodies) for other Chinese genre movies.  The trailer for one particular movie has English subtitles at the bottom of the screen and an on-screen character drops an ""F-bomb"".  Otherwise, you can throw out your grainy, washed-out bootlegs and pick up the best bad movie ever made.",1164240000,17,1266,4.9904761904761905
2626954,5,B000H5U5GM,"This is a must have for your DVD collection

or at leat rent it.

I saw this on Tv when I was a teen and loved it. Have not seen it since.

Very happy it has been released on DVD.

If you have not seen it you are in for a treat.

Its one of those not done the best movies but thats

one reason it is so good. Surprised it did not become a

cult classic.

This film came out about the sametime Ultraman started in Japan.

I read this was Chinas answer to Japans hit Ultraman.

Apparently it was not a hit in China since no other Inframan films were done that I know of.

Remember this was made during the period of the Chinese

hardline Communist goverment.

The Cd Rom question from a earlier review.

If you cd drive is a dvd is will have DVD printed on the front of the drive.

Put the disk in the drive.  When the movie comes up see if the DVD menu will let you get to the Cd rom features. If not stop the movie and close the DVD player.

Click on my computer, then right click on the Cd drive picture there.

On the menu that comes up click on explore. This will take you to the contents of the disk. Look at the folder names you should be able to tell

which one has the Cd rom stuff in it. Click on that folder to open it.

Then click on the files you want to run.

If it has sub folders you can still tell which folder has what by the name.

Click on the folder you want to open then on the file to run it.

Click= double click

Note- Copy protection on the disk may not allow access to the contents of the disk thru My computer or to the folders on the disk if they come up.",1162944000,5,1582,3.8266253869969042

2626956,4,B000H5U5GM,"I first saw a wonderfully badly dubbed ""Inframan"" on TV some years ago and fell in love with its laughable dialoge, remarkably bad special effects and rubber suit monsters. This movie must be seen and appreciated for all its wonderful awfulness! Lines like: ""This disaster is so bad .... it's the worst in the history of the world!"" That bad, eh? A five-year-old could have dubbed this movie better. Anyway, I love this movie for its crazy and bizarre monsters and villans (and sometimes grusome action). Watch this one with friends and have a party. Just, please, don't take it serious. The Shaw Brothers apparently didn't.",1159833600,5,624,4.89622641509434
2626978,5,B000H5U5GM,"An AMAZING movie !! I was in the 2nd grade when this was first released (im 48 now) and remember how thrilling it was to watch.

The part where infra man is fighting the beetle monster and it grew really tall and then Infra man grew really tall then Infra man threw the beetle monster and it shrank then Infra man stepped on it and its guts were green . hehehe how awesome is that ? Plenty awesome thats how ! And thats just ONE monster !!
  I do kind of feel a little sorry for the kids today who will grow up with memories of Star Wars the Force Awakens and other visually stunning films and who know nothing of cheesy movies.

2626996,1,B000H5U5GM,I don't hate the movie.  I specifically hate the version Amazon Prime has put on their service!  I remembered seeing this movie when I was a kid and it looked much better back then.  This looks to be taken from a bad VHS copy with a tracking problem.  The picture quality is that awful!  On top of that it's full frame!  And it's English dubbed.  I found 3 different versions of it on youtube in widescreen and all of them looked much better.  Obviously DVD quality.  The Shaw Brothers have done a much better job on their movies (many of which are shown on the ELREY network) in DVD format.  But you would not be able to tell from the copy you have dumped on your system.  Plus the online versions are the original language with subtitles.  Very disappointed in this.  Someone at Amazon Prime is just plain lazy!  I challenge you to fix this!,1451692800,3,843,4.354838709677419
2626997,1,B000H5U5GM,"Compare this superhero to those created by the Japanese, this one sucks big time. The transformation from human to superhero was so cheesy and funny.

2627008,4,B000H5U5GM,"I'm not a huge fan of English dubbed Japanese, or Chinese as this one is, films, but this one was on a higher, clearer level. Unless you watch a lot of this type of film, you probably wouldn't recognize any of the names, but the acting was fairly decent for this kind of story. It was, of course, over-exaggerated, like in a comic book and for all I know it may have originated in one. Lots of fun with lots of fight scenes that will martial arts fans ROFL at almost every hand-to-hand fight scene. But don't take my word for it.

2627044,5,B000H5U5GM,"""Super Inframan"" is a Shaw Brothers spectacle that is second to none for insane kaiju action. It's similar to ""Ultraman"" but if anything more ridiculous and full of irrepressible fun. The first element of success here is the setup of the evil Princess Dragonmom (in the original Mandarin, her name is the even more insane Demon Princess Elzebub) living under a volcano with her minions of various shapes and forms taking on civilization. Who can save the planet? Only Inframan, a biologically infused robot powered by a nuclear reactor.

This is really the first Chinese kaiju movie (I normally think of the term specifically related to Japanese monster movies, but it seems to best encompass the genre despite this film having been made in Hong Kong) and while it shares much in common with ""Ultraman"" and other Japanese television shows and films of the era, it has a unique feel that's more mystical (note the scarily Biblical pit of fire) while still being technologically oriented. The monsters are wonderful and the costumes are beyond great, starting at the outset with the first duo to deal with Inframan, the Mutant Drill and Plant Monster. I particularly loved the Plant Monster, who has completely visible shoes sticking out from the two tendrils he walks around on; watch also for the thunderball fists! Rayma (Danny Lee) becomes Inframan, and puts a human element of nobility into the character of a nuclear powered giant while Terry Liu excels as Princess Dragonmom, and is plausibly evil throughout making the two sides dramatically well balanced while still allowing the conflict to continuously devolve into over-the-top fights between unimaginable foes. Like other Shaw Brother spectacles, martial arts come into play, as do ingenious weapons and powers that have to be seen to be believed.

The DVD includes several extras including a lot of Shaw Brothers trailers which strongly hit the themes of martial arts, swordplay, and mysticism. There's also an adequate photo gallery, a choice between the original or English dubbed soundtrack and subtitles, and the original theatrical trailer.

If you want a genuinely fun, uproariously ridiculous monster movie that's a bit off the beaten path, ""Super Inframan"" is a great choice.",1436486400,2,2245,5.145205479452055

I can't give 5 stars due to hilariously choreographed fight scenes and bad voice overs.  The 'monsters' were more akin to Yo Gabba Gabba's creatures that stand and sway than to anything near menacing or scary.  A bad character costume making growling noises and shaking its arms at me does not inspire fantastic Jackie Chan quality martial arts.

Probably a great a movie to have on in the background while playing with action figures and only paying attention during the 'action' sequences.  Great free Prime movie.",1405296000,,636,5.135922330097087

This was Chinas answer to the popular Japanese Ultraman franchise. Ultraman was a huge success in Japan with toys, posters, and even a theme park. Ultraman is still going strong in Japan. Inframan not so much in China. Worth a look.",1353888000,,603,4.864077669902913
2627120,5,B000H5U5GM,"This movie is terrible.  And I absolutely love this movie.

Its hard to explain why some movies are just bad while some trancend their own badness and reach a rare spot where the constant and obvious shortcomings on display are just as memorable and incredibly entertaining as any good, fun movie you've seen.  Like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""StarCrash"" there's too much good-natured, movie-making zeal present in ""Super Inframan"" that even though it does nothing the way a good movie would, you get swept up by its energy and ridiculous audacity and can't help but love every second of it anyway.

Super Inframan's plot is as follows:  An earthquake occurs due to an eruption on Mt. Devil, a previously dormant volcano.  While authorities are still assessing its damage, the scientific institute recieves transmission from a dragon creature that turns into a strangely dressed woman identifying herself as Princess Dragon Mom (no, really!) who demands that all the earth submit to her as slaves and give her control of the planet.  Otherwise she'll destroy them, and has a gang of constantly dancing rubber suited monsters to ensure said destruction.

Because the authorities believe the situation to be the ""worst in human history"" they place a single professor and his science, uh... police team (I assume, as they all have uniforms, helmets, and carry pistols) in charge of stopping Princess Dragon Mom.  Professor takes Reima, one of his science police, downstairs and reveals to him that his plan to stop Princess Dragon Mom is to turn someone into Inframan, an Ultra-Man type cyborg super hero who is powerful enough to fight all the monsters.  Reima volunteers, Professor piles a bunch of random springs, batteries, and wires on him, and before you can say ""terrible dubbing"" Inframan is born!

The film from this point on is pretty much non-stop rubber suited kung fu fights with a level of creative insanity that simply has to be seen to be believed.

Some of my favorite moments include:

-Princess Dragon Mom being described by scientists as ""a creature of antiquity, at least 10 million years of age.""

-The government authority (we never find out who exactly he's supposed to be) leaving the Professor in charge of everything, and 3 seconds later in the very next scene the Professor putting his luitenant in charge of everything.

-One of the science police turns the corner in his motorbike and sees a giant root monster attacking the headquarters, so he phones inside the HQ to let the science police inside know they're being attacked.  Despite the giant roots loudly slamming down on the HQ's translucent ceiling, no one inside seems to notice anything til they get the phone call.

-Professor telling Riema that to be turned into Inframan he must ""go through the sufferings of hell... and maybe even death.""

-Inframan emerging from the lab for the very first time, and, despite only existing for about 30 seconds, immediately being identified as Inframan by three people who have never seen him before.

-Professor riding on the monster's speedboat to go negotiate with the Princess.  The image of him, sitting calmly on a boat between the two monsters is priceless.

-Reima fighting two monsters on his own for about 5 minutes BEFORE deciding to turn into Inframan (causing my wife to wonder aloud, ""What took so long, did he forget he could do that?"").

-Reima reving up his motorcycle and letting it charge, unmanned, straight into a monsters face (that poor stuntman...).

-Inframan using his wrist lasers to cut off a monsters head, only to have it grow back, then to try it again four more times in a row, resulting in 5 heads lying next to each other on the ground.

There's so much more, but I've made my case.  This movie is awesome, and well worth repeat viewings.  Buy it today, play it for a group of friends, and find out how many of your buds have a sense of humor.

Btw, Roger Ebert gave this film 3 stars out of 4.  Seriously.  Google ""Roger Ebert Infra-Man"" and it'll take you right to his website where you can read his review.  Even he's down with this movie, you should be too.",1352332800,2,4121,4.804255319148936

It's theme is based on tokusatsu/henshin shows like kamen rider and kikaider, it stands out and at times can be kind of a special treat.

2627138,5,B000H5U5GM,"Inframan(or ""Super Inframan"")was a live-action film put out in 1975 by the Gods of Kung-Fu cinema, the Shaw Brothers! It was an original movie not based on an anime/manga, but largely inspired by tokusatsu shows, mainly Kamen Rider. It even features music from Japanese shows like Ultra Seven. Quite a few of the martial artists in it were coming out of the Bruceploitation era of the early 70s, but there's some genuinely good fights in this, superhero-style!

The movie is about an evil dragon creature called Princess Dragon Mom(love that name!)who can take on the form of a sexy blonde, and she raises her army of kaiju rejects and gang of Ghost Rider clones to try and take over the world. The brilliant scientist Professor Chang decides to counter this invasion by creating a bionic man, so officer Rayma from the Science Patrol(no relation to the Ultraman one)volunteers to get the Robocop treatment. Rayma becomes Inframan, who can transform into robotic hero with super-strength, super-hearing, lasers, mini-missles, jetboot kicks, rocket punches, and energy blades. His coolest power is turning into a giant and squishing one of the monsters like a roach! In the end, Inframan has to rescue the Prof. and his whiny daughter from Dragon Mom's lair in a kickass scene where all the Science Patrol dressed in Evel Knievel battling the Ghost Riders.

There is some killer fight scenes in this, and all done in glorious ""wha-ta-ta-ta-ta""! The campy flavor of the 70s is in full swing too with corny dialogue and goofy-looking monsters. The English dub is unintentionally hilarious, and totally worth watching over the original Chinese language. The Shaw Bros. brought all their greatness to this with some of the best sentai action ever. This movie is a primo candidiate for your next MST3K session!",1291075200,,1804,5.030100334448161
2627139,4,B000H5U5GM,"This is one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. Imagine Power Rangers in the 1970's and you've got this movie right here.

And while it may sound like I'm slamming on this movie, I actually enjoyed it's cheesiness. Bought this based off a video review I saw, and it made an excellent movie to slam on for my ""Crappy Movie Night.""

Memorable Moments:

* Infra-Man--unknown by all until his creation--emerges for the first time only for someone to point at him and yell, ""Look! It's Infra-Man!""

* Infra-Man summoning the suit, jumping into the air, stock footage of flying for 5 seconds, only for him to land in the exact same spot.

* Towards the end an enemy falls into the water and the explosion happens before he even falls all the way in the water.",1289952000,,929,4.716049382716049
2627140,3,B000H5U5GM,"""Alex if the Answer of this Daily Double is 'Super InfraMan' the Question has to be:  'What is a movie so bad it's good?'""

I first saw this movie not long after it came out. In my personal lexicon, it rates right up (down) there with 'Plan Nine from Outer Space', especially if you are a fan of the classic Japanese Monster Movies, the Hong Kong chop-socky films of the 70s and Grade Z science fiction films.

The best description I ever came up with when I was trying to explain it to my friends was: 'Try to imagine a three-way cross between The Six Million Dollar Man with Lee Majors, Bruce Lee in Flying Fingers of Annihilation or whatever it was, and Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster...!'

The fact that the SFX are so bad (e.g. - the hero is converted to a cyborg basically by piling random springs, batteries and electronic junk next to his body and flickering the image between him as a human and as InfraMan while on a form-fitting operating table with some kind of ray device overhead; in some of the fight scenes the 'rays' don't even go all the way to the target!), only adds to the hilarity.

I am glad this movie has finally become available on DVD, and I expect to keep it in my collection indefinitely for those depressed times when I REALLY need to spend some time rolling on the floor laughing hysterically. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate it for what it is... but DON'T buy it if you are expecting to get the film that should have out-box-officed Star Wars and all it's sequels...!

Search Wikipedia of just google the title of the movie for background on the various released versions to get some idea of the twisted path a movie can follow to reach your screen, or just buy it. It's fun.",1231286400,2,1718,4.386792452830188
2627141,4,B000H5U5GM,"The year was 1980.  My family had just moved from Arkansas to San Jose California.  At the time, Silicon valley was just beginning to come into being.  Most of my new friends were Japanese, and it was then that I was introduced to the likes of early Anime, Ultraman and Kung Fu Theater...for those of you in the area at that time, horror host legend Bob Wilkens not only had ""Creature Features"" on at midnight, but he began to dawn a cheesy Ultraman style outfit and called himself ""Captain Cosmic"" to induce ""Ultraman"", ""Johnny Sacco and his Giant Robot"" and all other manor of Japanese monster / super-hero series upon a generation.  Five years later, a fellow student in my animation and art classes introduced me to this film.  Having disappeared from VHS, it took years of searching and waiting, but when it finally came out on DVD, I had to buy it!
If you've just landed upon this title, ""Inframan"" (now back in it's original Shaw Brothers title, ""Super Inframan"" (Known in China also as ""Chinese Superman""), this is an underground classic!  If you are familiar with Shaw Brothers (brought back to popularity by Quentin Tarintino), this is rather unusual; Shaw Brothers are responsible for the early Kung Fu craze / genera movies of the early '70's.  After the success of Ultraman in China, Shaw Brothers embarked upon this project,,their one and only super-hero movie.
As with all Shaw Brothers classics, this movie is far from an academy award winning plot or acting, and the English dubbing is absolutely terrible...but it all adds to the charm of the movie.  The special effects are almost on par with those of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  The plot?  An ancient demon, ""Princess Dragonmom"" (Priceless!!!) decides it's time to bring her demons and monsters to the surface to conquer the surface world.  To stop her, the world's most brilliant scientist takes a hero agent, combines him with advanced circuitry (vacuum tubes and large transistors and diodes) to create ""Inframan"".  From there on, Inframan encounters all the demons, defeating them one by one, until the final showdown in Dragonmom's lair.
Though low budget, the film is highly entertaining, bolstered by the terrible translation and dialogue.  Best lines:  ""Thunderball Fists?!  Can I have such a thing?""  ""She-demon...she killed me...she's in there!""  Most memorable:  Inside the ""ultra sophisticated"" laboratory / observatory / headquarters (filled with reel to reel tapes and enough blinking lights to induce an epileptic seizure in anybody), the brilliant scientist is informed of a predicament; ""Sir!  Mt. Devil has erupted...ten thousand people have been killed!""  A rapid zoom onto the scientist, who buries his chin in his hand, deep in thought.  ""Oh?  It's weird....""  Yes, a stinker, but a lovable stinker.  Best viewed if you turn off your brain and just watch it for fun...if you do, it's a ton of fun!  A great party flick!
About the DVD:  If you watch it in the English dub, you'll have to turn the volume up almost all the way just to hear it.  There are a few spots where the audio cuts out for a couple seconds at a time.  If you are a Shaw Brothers fan, it's also loaded with tons of Shaw Brothers trailers.  Best of all, except for cartoon violence, it's family friendly.  If your kids love ""Power Rangers"", they'll love this!",1228694400,4,3319,4.854092526690391
2627142,5,B000H5U5GM,"Finally available on DVD from Image Entertainment, the 1975 Shaw Brothers classic ""Super Inframan"" is presented in its 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio and enhanced for 16:9 TV's. The one and only ""Super Inframan"" is now fully restored from the original film negative and loaded with numerous extras. Many people not familiar with the Shaw Brothers might think that ""Super Inframan"" is not for them and just a silly kid's movie. This movie is an absolute delight for any Shaw Brothers or Superhero fan and pure fun for the whole family. The video transfer is from the Celestial Pictures version and its better than any previous version I've ever seen, its clear, crisp and the colors are vibrant to say the least. The sound options include Dolby Digital 2.0 as well as a new 5.1 option. The English dubbed version is not without its share of problems, the volume levels fluctuate up and down and it's muffled in some spots but not enough to spoil the experience for me.

A series of unexplained volcanic eruptions in Hong Kong unleashes a number of bizarre looking monsters from the depths of the earth. These mutant creatures are then transported into the modern day world to control and conquer the humans. The all but ineffective Earth defense team scrambles into action to combat the creatures by any means possible, but eliminating their leader won't be easy. It becomes apparent that the mutant monsters have been summoned by the wicked Dragon Princess and the only help for the Earth will come in the form of a superhero called Super InfraMan!  Will the scientific experiment to create ""Super Inframan"" (Danny Lee) be completed in time and if so, can ""Super Inframan"" save the citizens of Hong Kong and defeat the Dragon Princess (Terry Liu) and her mutant monster skeleton army for good. Armed with an arsenal of super powers including a solar ray, laser eyes, thunderball fists and super human strength; Super Inframan wastes no time getting in on the action. This is not your typical Shaw Brothers martial arts movie and fans of Ultraman, Iron King and Super Robot Red Baron are in for a definite treat. This non stop mind blowing action packed fan favorite is back with more monster mayhem, Shaw Brothers Style.

The only slight problem I have. There is no menu page. You put it in and it goes straight to the movie. After the end credits, it replays the movie. But that is a very small problem. Great to have it on DVD.",1521849600,,371,3.7088607594936707
