155797,5,0792844645,"What do you say about one of the greatest movies of all time FINALLY coming to Blu ray?  You say, ""Lord in heaven, what took you so long?!""  Still, no format of any kind ever dimmed two of the single most brilliant screen performances in history, Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole.  Ms. Hepburn brings a gorgeous, regal, dichotomous, vulnerable, and ruthless power to the life of an early very substantive ""landed"" queen of England; Mr. O'Toole, nearly ruthless throughout (with touches of his own form of vulnerability), is a non-stop tour de force of what a king in his times likely had to be to hold the throne of a developing but still fractured country.  All of the supporting performances - incidentally, the premiers of Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton, to name a few - are as flawless as their megastar counterparts.  The movie, however, belongs to every single scene the powerful and utterly captivating Hepburn marches or gently slides into.  She is shimmering.",1522800000,,975,4.914634146341464

155802,1,0792844645,"So this is a 50th anniversary edition??? The image is strong enough, maybe too strong, too punchy of color - sometimes it looks like OTooles mouth is full of blood - but this is what we get otherwise? It is based on the so-called 4K scan that was screened in select (one or two?) theaters last year, which I enjoyed seeing and thought hopeful. Detail is good, but negative damage has been half heartedly brushed up. There is grain so I don't know why people are complaining there isn't any. Does grain matter when there are so many other problems with this release?

No one has yet mentioned the strange horizontal rippling, very faint, that rolls down some of the darker scenes, then disappears when the film cuts to a different set up/camera angle. Is this inherent in the negative? Or just some brainless encoding mistake?

Audio is idiotic. Such a booming, powerful Oscar winning score should shake the house down. The opening titles usually sound like a call to war. Here, those horns sound like distant traffic, whether in the pseudo 5.1 or the 2.0 mono.

Complaining about the unsteady opening titles is utterly pointless since thats how the film looks on film. Ive seen the film three times projected from 35mm and then one final time last year from the 4K restoration DCP, in which a changeover mark was left.

There are no sync problems; I got close to the screen and consonants hit right on. I even compared to the 2001 DVD. Dont know why some are having sync problems. The films rapid fire dialogue shoots like arrows from Plantagenet mouths, though ADRd lines seem to stand out more than they used to, probably due to a remix from the elements by people who had nothing to do with the film when it was originally mixed.

So there we have it. Buy it in its floppy plastic case if you must. Youll get a pretty good picture of an old movie but youll have to crank up the volume. Its about on par a blu ray release as BECKET, though that other Plantagenet film has stronger audio and better packaging and much better bonus material (the only OToole film with an OToole commentary!!!) but with just as uneven a picture as its unwitting sequel Lion. There seems no chance now of a proper BD release for this film. StudioCanal were always arrogant Philistines with their library. I wouldnt expect anything more from that province.",1521676800,3,2336,4.592326139088729
155803,1,0792844645,"Okay, while Europe has had this monumental classic on Blu-ray for more than a decade, it took Kino Lorber far too long to give us this 'remastered' Blu-ray: advertised as a 4K scan from Studio Canal. Too much gate weave and image wobble. The opening credits are a nightmare. The rest of the movie is inconsistently rendered at best. Colors are better than on any of the Euro-editions. But honestly, they did a 4K scan and didn't check it for instability?!?!? Whose running the show? Helen Keller?  Bottom line: with a superb pedigree and outstanding performances from Kate Hepburn, Peter O'Toole, Anthony Hopkins, and, Timothy Dalton this should have been a highly recommended 'must own' disc. It's not. Will it ever get revisited again? In a perfect world, it most definitely should!  Bottom line: total fail and a real waste of your money.

155804,5,0792844645,"This review is for the 50th Anniversary Restored Blu-Ray Edition of The Lion in Winter.

I have waited for a remastered, English-subtitled release of this glorious film for years.  First, a few words about this edition.  The film has received careful remastering, and the picture and sound put one in mind of a new film, let alone a 50-year-old classic.  The picture is glorious and the sound magnificent.  And the subtitles!  Unlike many subtitles, the English subtitles for this edition follow the script exactly and, in fact, the timing of the subtitles even match the delivery of the lines!  I could not ask for more, and I expected a lot.

I suppose its not a coincidence, but the play and screenplay of my favorite film (The Lion in Winter) and the book of my favorite Broadway musical (Follies) were both written by the same man  James Goldman.  And what writing it is!  The Lion in Winter is not so much a script, as it is a celebration of the English language.  In reviewing the play, one critic said, The Lion in Winter has more wit in every speech than most so-called comedies have in an entire evening.

By the way, for those who don't get it, The Lion in Winter is a comedy.  A comedy about a dysfunctional family.  Many people completely miss the point and think that this is simply a period drama.  It is not.  If sarcasm, wit and amazing use of the English language are your thing, then this film is for you.  Of course, no one spoke that way in the late twelfth century.  But the fact that it is written in modern language just adds to the humor of the piece.  This has been my favorite film since I first saw it, just a few years after its initial release, and even though I have seen it at least forty times, I never tire of the wit, the conflict and the often-subtle humor of the screenplay.  As many people know, Katherine Hepburn won her third Academy award for this film, and it won two more (screenplay and original score), besides being nominated for a total of seven Oscars.  In addition to the magnificent performances of Hepburn and Peter OToole, its fun today to see a practically unrecognizable Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton at the dawn of their careers.

Its possible that someday, another film will come along to usurp The Lion in Winters position as my all-time favorite film.  But until then, and even then, I will never stop singing its praises.  Very, very highly recommended.",1521244800,5,2417,4.552204176334107
155805,4,0792844645,"The Lion In Winter,"" based on the play by James Goldman, is a historical drama about a royal conflict that takes place within the walls of an English castle. All powerful King Henry II (Peter OToole) summons his politically ambitious family to a reunion in 1183. This includes his wife, Eleanor (Katharine Hepburn), whom he has kept in a remote castle to keep her from meddling with his empire. Three sons struggle to win the favor of their fathers favor, as well as his crown. King Henry and Eleanor engage in a battle of wits that pits eldest son Richard the Lionheart (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs) against his brothers John (Nigel Terry, Excalibur) and Geoffrey (John Castle, Man of La Mancha), while the cunning King Philip of France (Timothy Dalton, The Living Daylights) takes advantage of the internal turmoil in his bid to destroy their kingdom.

Ms. Hepburn is terrific as the scheming and shrewd Eleanor of Aquitaine, her verbal duels with OToole a highlight of the film. Hepburn would go on to win her third Academy Award for this performance, the first actress in history to do so. Under Anthony Harveys direction, The Lion In Winter is a witty, literate, and inventive picture though, visually, it tends to be stagey in many of its scenes. An exception is the impressive scene in which Eleanor arrives by boat, making an entrance fit for a queen. Exiting the boat, she sees her husband and dryly states, How dear of you to let me out of jail.

The movie abounds with this kind of dialogue. Addressing her son, Richard the Lionheart, Eleanor candidly exclaims The only thing you want to see is your fathers vitals on a bed of lettuce. Of Henry, she recalls He had a mind like Aristotle and a form like mortal sin. Henry gets in some pretty good zingers, too. At holiday time, he muses What shall we hang  the holly or each other? On being king, he philosophizes Ive snapped and plotted all my life. Theres no other way to be king, alive, and 50 all at once.

Its unlikely the actual Henry and Eleanor were as deft with bon mots, but thats part of the fun of the movie. Its a highly entertaining, often funny, look at two giants of English royalty. Watching Hepburn and OToole is witnessing a Master Class in acting, as they play beautifully off each other with impeccable timing and the ability to convey arrogance, anger, passion, or frustration as each scene requires.

Bonus materials on the newly restored widescreen Blu-ray release include audio commentary by director Anthony Harvey, an interview with sound recordist Simon Kaye, and the original theatrical trailer.",1521158400,,2594,4.74279379157428

155810,5,0792844645,"I can see why Katherine Hepburn got an Oscar.  They all deserved one.  I watched this a day after watching Beckett and liked is as much or better.  O'Toole was incredibly good in both.  Almost but not quite bloody violence in Lion as in Beckett.  Was wondering whether Hepburn would betray me like Burton did (being in a bloody movie).  Lion made me think, I must admit, of a medieval Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.  The dialog was quick and sharp and often (usually) clever.  But also for that reason unreal.  The action came near the end.  Only one complaint at all:  I missed a good 1/3 of what was said because they whispered and mumbled.  I hated that though I kept up with the story in spite of it - all except the King of France.  What was he to do with it all?  It was written by James Goldman whose brother (William Goldman) is also a writer and a fantastically prolific one.  James not so much.  I've read a lot of Williams' novels and once wanted to read them all.  Lion was on the stage before becoming a movie.  I just ordered a copy of the play.  The movie was so good, I wanted to read the play.  On stage, Robert Preston was Henry and Julie Harris was Eleanor.  I'd give anything to have seen that.",1519516800,,1215,4.241228070175438

155816,5,0792844645,"The Lion In Winter is one of those ""perfect"" films.  Perfection in scripting, perfection in acting, perfection in camera, perfection in directing, perfection in setting.  Let's take setting for example.  It is the year 1183 AD, and the sets are rough, austere, lived in, with dirt floors, filthy animals, cauldrons of stew cooking, and drab colors and clothing which are a far cry from the ""bathroom and boudoir movies"" that were rampant in the times.  Like more modern film makers (think Ridley Scott's Robin Hood for example), Anthony Harvey directs this masterpiece with realism.  James Goldman's darkly comedic/dramatic script reads like modernized Shakespeare and Peter O'Toole, Katharine Hepburn, Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of the players, all deliver the complicated intrigue with such believability that the Bard himself must have possessed both Harvey and Goldman.  Even Timothy Dalton makes you forget he was a one-shot Bond, this Dalton was fully deserving of an Academy Award, as was Hopkins.  Between them and O'Toole & Hepburn, the tour de force here is unequaled!

Here's how The Lion In Winter fared in '69 Award season:  Best Actress Academy Award to Hepburn, Best Screenplay Academy Award to Goldman, Best Original Music Score Academy Award to John Barry;  Golden Globes went to producer Martin Poll for best picture and to O'Toole for best actor; and of course pretty much everyone from the director on down to the janitor was nominated for every applicable category!

After Lawrence Of Arabia, this is O'Toole's greatest acting achievement; after The African Queen, this is Kat Hepburn's greatest acting achievement.  The performances turned in by young Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton are stupendous and in Tony's case, really gave indication of where he was headed later in life.  The men in this movie are sniveling, underhanded, sneaky, and quietly violent, all working their subterfuges and deceptions in vile manipulations of each other, while Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn) is only let out of prison for Christmas with her sons, and Alais (Jane Merrow in a Supporting Actress nominated role) is promised to one of the sons but is Henry's ""mistress"".  The cauldron really bubbles and there is hell to pay.  Watch Henry II perform his machinations and see how the rooms full of seriously vehement Agatha Christie type characters with Shakespearean motivations go to town for their own selfish goals.  This movie is an actors paradise and a directors dream, too bad they can't all be this good!

155820,4,0792844645,"Review of The Lion in Winter
Hot Toasty Rag, November 7, 2017

Picture, if you will, Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? set in 1100s England, and instead of dinner guests, the lead couple bickers with their adult children. Now replace Liz and Dick with Katharine Hepburn and Peter OToole. Thats The Lion in Winter.

In 1183, King Henry II is in the winter of his life. He has his heart set on leaving the throne to his youngest son, but his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine wants their eldest son to inherit. For years, Henry has imprisoned the queen in a faraway castle, only letting her out for royal functions and holidays. During Christmas, shes brought home, and the two rulers play a nonstop game of cat and mouse, constantly trying to outsmart and out-hurt the other. With their three sons and the visiting king of France as pawns, its an incredibly lively story.

Peter OToole reprises his role as Henry II; hed already played him four years earlier in Becket. He gives a wonderful, emotional, frustrated performance, but in the stiff competition for Best Actor in 1969, he lost to the unworthy performance of Cliff Robertson in Charly. Its tough to pick which loss is more appalling, The Lion in Winter or Becket. In either case, and even though Im sure Richard Burton would have been just as good if not better in this role, Peter OToole is impressive. The sons are played by Anthony Hopkins, John Castle, and Nigel Terry. It was Anthony Hopkinss second theatrical film, and Timothy Daltons first; Tim was very touched that Kate would come onto the set on her days off to act with him when he did his closeups and her presence wasn't technically needed. Theres an awful lot of touching trivia relating to this film. Peter and Kate enjoyed each others company on the set, having known each other for years earlier; Peter named his daughter after her. And speaking of descendants, Katharine Hepburns lineage can actually be traced back to Eleanor and Henry II!

The art and production designs are fantastic in the film. The castle is expansive, but the rooms are mostly empty. The thrones look worn and slightly coarse, and the jewelry looks rich but primitive. Margaret Furses costumes are in mostly dark, muted colors, and they look very authentic. Furs and large swaths of linen are draped over the actors shoulders; there are no ornately sewn gowns because in the 1100s, lavish clothes couldn't really have been created.

And finally, theres Katharine Hepburn, who won her third Best Actress Oscar for the film. She vacillates between angry, hurt, cunning, desperate, hopeful, loving, deceitful, and exhausted, and each emotional change takes the audience with her. At times shell make you laugh and at times shell make you cry. Youll be kept on your toes, unsure of who to trust or root for, but itll be worth it. After all, as Kate said in the film, Every family has their ups and downs.",1510012800,2,2890,4.737574552683896

In this film, she comes home for the annual Christmas court. Hepburn did a magnificent job portraying Eleanor. Peter O'Toole does an equally magnificent job as Henry II. The disfunction of this family is massive, yet they produced many generations of kings, and in this generation, three of their sons became King: Henry the young King who was co-king with his father but never given any authority; Richard the Lionhearted, the crusader, and the regrettable John who used people to his own ends and caused the Magna Carta to be written just to keep him from continuing his mayhem.

155853,5,0792844645,Classy actors in a great movie.,1489017600,,31,4.333333333333333
155854,5,0792844645,"During the beginning the film, when Henry II played by Peter O'Toole and Eleanor of Aquitaine played by Katherine Hepburn, meet for the annual Christmas fte during which the queen is released from imprisonment for purely ceremonial purposes.
The opening quips reveal the nature of their adversarial relationship and of things to come.

Henry II: How was your crossing? Did the waters part for you?
Eleanor: It went flat when I told it to; I did not think to ask for more.
  How dear of you to let me out of jail.

This depiction is priceless and a perfect indicator of the events to come during this Yuletide family reunion; which to say the least, a graphic depiction of the power struggle between Eleanor and Henry.

This is a simplified depiction based upon fact; however, the overwhelming complexities of the history of The Duchy of Aquitaine, which at one time made up a third of France cannot be told with any coherency in a single film.
There are other films such as Beckett and A Man For All Seasons; just to name a few, which provide minuscule insights into the history of medieval French and English histories which are better left to learned scholars in academia.

These films are filled with historical inaccuracies and typically portray the various players simplistically as either entirely villainous or victims with whom the audience is entirely sympathetic to.

It is the same with The Lion in Winter which, as are the numerous other productions chronicling the events of that period, are nothing but elaborate stagings that are meant to showcase the considerable talents of extraordinarily gifted actors.

While the depictions of verbal fencing and intrigues are oversimplified they are nonetheless imbued with an appreciable quality that make them highly entertaining and believable; provided you don't take them too seriously.

Hepburn and O'Toole are consummate actors blessed with rare talent; they are intellectual equals as are the characters they portray.
The scenes of Ms. Hepburn's interaction with her various offspring in an effort to curry their favor are impressively touching as they are harshly revealing of the complexities of a formidable woman attempting to assess and influence her children; each endowed with decidedly different traits, temperaments and ambitions.

The portrayal of the children themselves as individuals or interacting with one another are well served by enhancements in the script which tend to overstate the qualities of the characters. As I previously indicated, this technique is vital to differentiating the personae of each character, making it easier for the viewer to understand and relate to the character.

Each scene is depicted with flawlessly targeted precision and dispenses with any superfluous embellishments and contain carefully placed moments of humor that preclude the need for overstated scenarios of comic relief in the strict Shakespearian sense.

Although the premise of this film is that of a period drama, the plot is presented in such a way as to portray the lives of Henry's family as a modern, highly dysfunctional family gathered for a Christmas holiday in crisis mode, which makes the subject matter easier for the audience to understand and relate to.

Mr. O'Tooles' performance is nothing less then perfection that is augmented by his strong intuitive sense of understanding how to navigate the complexities of interpreting his character in a completely convincing manner that is finely synchronized with the sensibilities of the audience.

For the most part, the plot deftly conveys the essence of the storyline and is thoroughly entertaining, making each scene an enticement to look deeper into the lives of these two pivotal characters.",1489017600,,3727,5.210702341137123

155964,5,0792844645,"Here's a tremendous movie from 1968, a real classic, and at a great price.  Katharine Hepburn plays her age and Peter O'Toole plays over his age as the mismatched Eleanor of Aquitaine and King Henry II.  So mismatched that he has had her thrown into prison and let her out only because Christmas 1183 is at hand.  Their three sons (played by Anthony Hopkins, John Castle and Nigel Terry) contend for Henry's considerable lands in England and France after he is gone.  A foil is introduced -- the French King, played by a very young Timothy Dalton.

This film has it all -- great performances by a great cast at various stages in their careers, familial conflict, historic conflict (the eldest son, Richard (known to history as Richard the Lion-Heart) is gay, or at least seriously smitten with the King of France), wonderful dialog and no small amount of wit (Eleanor on her role in a prior Crusade:  ""I rode bare-breasted halfway to Damascus.  The troops were dazzled.  I damn near died of windburn"").  Impressive but realistic medieval locations and powerful choral music add to the overall excellence of this production.

I watch this movie very often, and am disappointed that this disc, although it has subtitles for French and Spanish viewers, has none for American/English viewers, although it is an American made movie with English speaking actors.

156136,5,0792844645,"This movie is beyond superlative.  From the costumes and scenery, which reflect both the historical King Henry II's general disdain for pomp and foppish comforts, as well as the likely reality of life in a 12th century castle, to the sheer magnificence of the dialogue, this movie is without peer.  Peter O'Toole is magnificent as the aging King Henry II, at once a powerful and energetic warrior, who has found some peace in his latter years, and wants to maintain that peace.  Katherine Hepburn as Queen Eleanor, the richest and most powerful woman in Europe, is nothing short of legendary.  Richard Burton, as Richard the Lionheart, is entirely believable...one can easily imagine that Richard really was like Burton portrayed him.  The rest of the cast are exemplary and the perfectly chosen for their roles.

This play is magnificent on the stage, but O'Toole and Hepburn give THE definitive performance.  The dialogue is both emotive and literate and filled with humor.  But within moments those humorous lines can become powerfully sad and tragic.  Modern day writers and filmmakers could learn much from watching this movie, far from dumbing down the dialogue, this play raises the dialogue to the level of truly grand.

Possibly one of the most powerful moments ever committed to film is O'Toole's performance when, in the chamber of King Philip of France, the betrayal of all of his sons is revealed.  The moment when Geoffrey reveals John's treachery O'Toole plays as if he were accepting a physical blow.  His speech, ""My life, when it is written, will read better than it lived"", is filled with the tragic reality of lost hope, of lost love, of lost opportunity.  It is an affecting and moving scene, played perfectly by one of the truly great actors.

In short, this movie is as perfect as movies can be.  The perfect confluence of script, cast, direction, scenery, musical score...it doesn't get any better than this.",1430352000,32,1932,4.956521739130435

Close and Stewart are good, but the three actors who play their sons are annoying.  Last night I rented this film version with Hepburn and O'Toole.  Again Hepburn and O'Toole are good, but the three actors who play the sons are just as annoying so apparently that was the intent of the writer and/or director.  Dalton as King Phillip was o.k.  Basically it just comes down to the preference of the person watching Lion in Winter whether you like the cast from the TV version or the movie version.

156196,4,0792844645,"Both the acting and the script are excellent: sharp and entertaining. Henry II, an early English king and grandson of William the Conqueror, is getting old and wants to secure his heir and the line of succession of his crown and lands. This launches a battle of wits in both the domestic and political spheres. If you are interested in palace intrigue, you should watch this movie. Anthony Hopkins (as one of Henry's son's) and Timothy Dalton (as the young king of France) have their cinematic debuts in this film, and Katherine Hepburn (as Henry's wife Eleanor of Aquitaine) and Peter O'Toole (as Henry) could not have done a better job in their roles.

On the other hand, some of the dialogue, while unbelievably clever and fun, comes across as artificial, and the movie as a whole is a little stagey. Given that the film is an adaptation of a play, this is not a huge shock and didn't really bother me. I was more troubled by some dated themes/attitudes. One character is said to be gay, and the other characters (and the movie) uncritically assume that he became gay because his mother spent too much time with him.

For me, the interesting, complex relationship between Henry and Eleanor compensate for the movie's shortcomings.",1422489600,,1233,4.757009345794392

Yes, it's anachronistic and in some cases historically inaccurate, but also one of the best dramas you'll ever see set in any century.  The dialogue is alternatively witty, introspective, devious, or laced with hostility that is thrown like a dagger into the chest of a mortal enemy. Sibling rivalry on a royal scale, the three surviving sons of Henry II  are vying for power and the throne, complicated by the presence of Alis, Henry's mistress who by treaty is supposed to be marrying his heir (Richard? John?) in return for a small but strategic portion of French land. Add  the young King Philip of France, presumed lover of Richard, and son of King Louis, first husband of Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, who has been imprisoned for years for inciting her sons into armed rebellion against Henry, but released temporarily to lend authenticity to the negotiations with Phillip.

I agree with the acclaim associated with the production.  Truth really is stranger than fiction and one simply needs to jump back nine centuries to confirm.  The acting was a little ""hammy/over-the-top/campy"" for me but, then again, there are some pretty big egos on the cast and the characters they portrayed so that was to be expected.

156404,4,0792844645,"This film was adapted from James Goldman's play that bears the same title. He also did the film's screenplay, with the film being directed by Anthony Harvey. This shows throughout the film, although you (or, I, at least) do not mind the theatrical scenes, given the rather superb dialogues and psychological warfare going on between the characters, and especially the two main ones: the old King, Henry II (Peter O'Toole) and his fiery, estranged and imprisoned wife Alienor, Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right.

The title of the film (and of the play) refers to the ageing Henry II, King of what some historians have called ""the Angevine Empire"". In addition to England and parts of Wales and Ireland, it also included most of France; far more of it than what the King of France, to whom Henry owed homage, had himself.

The film's strongest point lays in its constant scheming and verbal warfare, in an atmosphere of utter distrust between just about all the protagonists including Henry and Alienor's three surviving sons (Richard, Geoffrey and John), and Philip, the newly crowned King of France. The action takes place at Christmas, at the castle of Chinon, where Henry has conveyed all the others to let them know who will succeed him, how his vast lands will be shared out and whether, at last, young Alice (the elder sister of the King of France but whom Henry had made into his mistress) will be married of to the heir of the Angevine Empire.

The dominant theme across the whole film is the love/hate relationships and selfish interests between the various members of the Plantagenet dynasty. As for Philip (played by a very young Timothy Dalton), there is in reality only hate as he is forced to compose with his more powerful vassals and tries to pit them against each other. The whole play is a collection of devious plots with just about everyone betraying everyone else.

The central characters are the ageing Henry II and Alienor (superbly played by Katharine Hepburn) who fight against each other like cat and dog all the time, shifting from tenderness, to spite and fury to regrets without anyone knowing for sure when they are really being sincere. Together, they manage to hurt just about everyone else, starting with their sons and including each other. The only character that comes out as being somewhat sympathetic is Alice, probably because she is an unwilling pawn in what is a theatrical and superb ""Games of Thrones"".

The characters of the sons are more contrasted. While Richard the soldier (played by a young Anthony Hopkins) is shown as tormented and used by his mother against his father who knows he is the best of the litter, Geoffrey is devious and cunning, and suffers from his parents' indifference. John, however, is a bit of a caricature and shown as a wimp, according to the traditional portrait of him. Although erratic and not as strong willed as his brothers, he may have not been the utter coward and incompetent that he shown to be in the film.

156413,5,0792844645,"Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I'll just come right out and say it: this is the best movie I've seen.  Based on a stage play of the same name, and a sort of sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becket-Blu-ray/dp/B001D5F2LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becket [Blu-ray</a>],  it is a masterwork of dialogue and acting.  Other films have come close, but in my opinion none have matched it.  This is one of my ""desert island"" dvds, and the one I most strongly recommend purchasing.

Having said that, I wasn't very happy with the transfer.  I don't mean to say that it's bad, because it's not; I just think a film of this caliber deserves better.  It's 16x9 widescreen; the sound and picture, while not as good as they should be, are still fair.  There is a director's commentary track, which I did not listen to, as I usually find them quite dull, but perhaps this one is different.  You may be tempted to buy the Studiocanal Blu-ray; don't, because it's only formatted for PAL.  Hopefully they'll release a North American version soon.

The basic plot: an aging Henry II convenes a Christmas court at Chinon (France), and all sorts of infighting, backbiting, and family drama ensue.  The film/play does take a good deal of license with historic facts, but so what?  They weren't making a documentary.  There was not one miscast role in the entire film, and all the actors complement one another perfectly.  Despite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lawrence-of-Arabia-Restored-Version-Blu-ray/dp/B008Y1YK0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lawrence of Arabia (Restored Version) [Blu-ray</a>] launching O'Toole to international stardom, this is the film where he truly shines.

Top marks from me, and well worth adding to your video library.  I also advise purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becket-Blu-ray/dp/B001D5F2LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becket [Blu-ray</a>], as these two movies make an excellent pair.

Favorite quote (Nigel Terry as John): ""My God, if I went up in flames, there's not a living soul who would pee on me to put the fire out!""

The gist of the plot is King Henry II trying to set up 1 of 3 sons as heir apparent. He favors John, which leaves Richard and Geoffrey scrambling to make alliances with the queen and King Philip of France to ensure that they can derail their father's plans.
Cornball scenes worthy of Shakespeare evolve with Princes John and Geoffrey meeting secretly with King Philip. A knock on the door sends them into hiding behind a curtain. Prince Richard (the Lionheart) enters to plot with France's king. Another knock on the door sends Prince Richard behind another cutain. Enter Peter O'Toole as King Henry to let King Philip know that he better watch his step. One by one his sons are revealed, much to Henry's chagrin. Throughout it all, only exiled Queen Eleanor (Hepburn), pulled out of mothballs by King Henry II occasionally when cavorting with his mistresses might prove too unsightly to his subjects, maintains some sense of dignity, which is probably why she won an Oscar.
Reducing great swaths of history, especially when it involves 2 kingdoms as important as England and France were in the 12th century, is simply asking too much of a 2-1/4 hour movie. Viewers would much better be served by a miniseries at least 10 hours long.",1367193600,,1486,4.8313725490196076
156432,5,0792844645,"I just watched, for the third time, one of the greatest films ever made. ""The Lion in Winter"" is about England's King Henry II and his queen, the glorious Eleanor of Aquitaine. This particular episode in their lives takes place at the Christmas court of 1183 A.D. and is rife with discord and drama as each of their three sons vies for their parents' attention and ultimately, for Henry's crown. The dialogue is deep and rich and the acting superb. Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn embody their roles with robust energy and sublime elegance. This film was viscerally stimulating without gun fights, car chases or explosions. The dialogue driven play was acted out entirely in the candlelit shadows of a medieval castle and was riveting simply by virtue of the stunning acting and gut-wrenching emotion pouring forth from each character in turn.

The film itself is brilliant and finds the cast, writer, and director at the top of their respective games.  As a stage play with rich language and twists and turns and characters with twisted agendas it is converted magnificently to the screen.  This is ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?"" set in Medieval Times and the family dysfunction here is epic.
Set during Christmas ""holdays"" in 1183, Peter O'Toole as Henry ll frees imprisoned Queen Eleanor played by Katharine Hepburn for a verbal donnybrook as they both plot Henry's succession.  Anthony Hopkins in his first screen role is stellar as the repressed and Oedipal first born Richard The Lionheart and a very young Tomothy Dalton does an awesome turn as the slimy King of France.  Hepburn plumbs the depths in this very modern psychodrama;  ""I even made poor Louis take me on Crusade. How's that for blasphemy. I dressed my maids as Amazons and rode bare-breasted halfway to Damascus. Louis had a seizure and I damn near died of windburn... but the troops were dazzled.""  For all her awesome presence and naturalism in her 1930s-1940s classics, this might be her best effort and it did not go unnoticed, she won the Academy award for this portrayal of Eleanor Of Aquitaine.  O'Toole chomps scenery with the best of 'em and as the wild eyed and agenda-driven Henry ll he is tops.  The chemistry between he and Kate belies their 25 year age difference, the two of them match each other blow for blow while serving the script brilliantly.  It's a tour de force really, a great study of two actors fulfilling their roles while truly playing WITH each other.  Damn, they're good.

Henry, the great-grandson of William the Conqueror, was the first of the House of Plantagenet to rule England....at the age of 19, Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine....Their relationship, always stormy, eventually disintegrated: after Eleanor encouraged her children to rebel against their father in 1173, Henry had her placed under house arrest, where she remained for fifteen years.""

Henry's famous despairing cry, 'Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?' -- leads to Becket's martyrdom in his cathedral"" (It should be noted that the Catholic Encyclopedia suggests Thomas' conversion to have been less dramatic; it also indicates that Henry II's culpability for Thomas' murder is unclear.).

156459,4,0792844645,"This is the story of the acrimonious relationship between King Henry II of England and his wife Eleanor of Acquitaine. Henry was the first of the Plantagenets, the son of Matilda of Anjou, who was the daughter of Henry I. There had been anarchy in England for two decades or more after the death of Henry I as Stephen fought to retain the crown against the claims of Matilda, each with their warring armies. This right of succession, continued on with Henry II's sons, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey and John, and was sometimes aided and sometimes resisted by Eleanor, who was kept prisoner for more than a decade by Henry because of her powerful interference. Viewers need to know something of the historical backdrop to fully appreciate the movie; I knew nothing of this historical scenario when I first viewed the movie in the cinema.

There is not a great deal of action in the film, which is all about these family relationships and the right of succession. But the acting of Peter O'Toole (Henry II) and Katherine Hepburn (Eleanor) is excellent, and Anthony Hopkins as Richard (later, King Richard I) is suitably aggressive as the Crusade warrior he was, and John Castle is appropriately devious as Geoffrey. Timothy Dalton also has a well-executed supplementary role as Philip II of France and pretty Jane Merrow plays Alais, Henry's mistress. The film score by John Barry is also noteworthy. This is an excellent film: I have withheld one of the * only because the `action' rarely moves from the castle where they spend Christmas in a film lasting over two hours.

156466,4,0792844645,"Yes, Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn were both magnificent actors. Yes, Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine were magnificent roles for them to play. How could this movie miss?

It is nearly Christmas in 1183, and Henry must decide which of his three surviving sons should inherit the throne. His oldest, Henry III, is dead. Richard, who came to be known as the Lion-Hearted (Anthony Hopkins), is next in line and Eleanor's favorite. But John (Nigel Terry), the youngest and a ratty little pimple-faced twerp, is Henry's favorite. I could never figure why. Perhaps because Richard was Eleanor's favorite. Richard and Eleanor love to fight. They plan and plot and make each other miserable, and seems to relish the fighting as much as anything.

Geoffrey, the middle son (John Castle), is a handsome young man, very self-possessed, very smart, and very calculating. He expects to be John's chancellor when John is king, as Henry has promised.

Another complication is Alais (Jane Merrow), a French princess and Henry's mistress. She has already brought a dowry with her when she came to Henry's court, even though she was just a child then. She is to wed whichever prince is named Henry's successor. But she can't stand John; nobody can. And she really is in love with Henry.

So here comes Philip, the young King of France, to demand that his sister Alais either be married to the successor or her dowry returned. Philip is a charming young man that Henry keeps calling ""Boy,"" even though Philip calls him to task for it.

Most of the story involves the plots, counter-plots, betrayals, and deceits that are involved in the decision about the succession. Since we in their future already know who's going to be the next king, there's no suspense about that. And perhaps for knowledgeable historians there is little suspense at all. But I enjoyed trying to follow who was doing what to whom and why. So just in case you're no great historian yourself, I'll leave off any details.

It's a dark movie in many ways, including the literal. Henry's castle (Eleanor has been locked up elsewhere for years, and is only let out because there is to be a Christmas court) is a primitive thing: it is 1183, after all, and as Eleanor points out, ""We're all savages."" The great hall's floor is strewn with straw, dogs wander about grabbing such scraps of food as they can, and the knights sit at long rough tables with long rough benches. Only the high table is any nicer. But the costumes are lovely, the story is complex, the acting is grand, and a good time can be had in 1183 with the royals.",1337126400,3,2583,4.716186252771618

The 1994 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 12 to 27 February 1994 in and around Lillehammer, Norway. Lillehammer failed to win the bid for the 1992 event. Lillehammer was awarded the games in 1988, after having beat Anchorage, United States; stersund, Sweden; and Sofia, Bulgaria. The games were the first to be held in a different year than the Summer Olympics, the only to be held two years after the previous games, and the last to be held in a small town. The games were the second hosted in Norway, and the second Winter Olympics in the Nordic Countries, after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo.

While many events took place in Lillehammer, skating took place in Hamar, some ice hockey matches were placed in Gjvik, while Alpine skiing was held in yer and Ringebu. Sixty-seven countries and 1,737 athletes participated in six sports and sixty-one events. Fourteen countries made their debut in the Winter Olympics, of which nine were former Soviet republics. The games also saw the introduction of stricter qualifying rules, reducing the number of under-performing participants from warm-weather countries. New events were two new distances in short track speed skating and aerials, while speed skating was moved indoors. Nearly two million people spectated the games, which were the first to have the Olympic truce in effect. The games were succeeded by the 1994 Paralympics from 10 to 19 March.

Manuela Di Centa and Lyubov Yegorova dominated women's cross-country skiing, taking five and four medals, respectively. A crowd of over 100,000 saw Italy beat Norway by 0.4 seconds on the men's 4 x 10 km relay. Vreni Schneider won a complete set of medals in Alpine skiing, while Norway took a medal sweep in the men's combined. Nancy Kerrigan had before the games been clubbed by Tonya Harding's associate, but managed to take silver in ladies' singles. Johann Olav Koss won three speed skating events, while 13-year-old Kim Yoon-Mi became the youngest-ever Olympic gold medalist. Sweden beat Canada in a dramatic penalty shootout in the ice hockey final. With 11 gold medals, Russia won the most events, while with 26, Norway collected the most medals overall.

There is some film grain as befits a film of this era and the Sound Track is unmodified but the film benefits from the subtle image improvement. (All you do is switch off Japanese subtitles). Plays fine on my Region A laptop (Sony Vaio with 1080p) and when I compare with Region 1 DVD there is a big difference. So if US distrbutors cannot get their act together then buy the Japanese version which is available from Amazon in Japan on www.amazon.co.jp.

It may not be the most authentic dialog but it has a great sense of fun and vitality. Up to now I have settled for the DVD which I enjoyed but have just ordered the Japanese Blu Ray (why do they always get stuff first?) which I hope will make it's medieval qualities even more enjoyable. This is a movie for lovers of plot and characters, not for you if you have a youtube attention span, look for car chases and explosions or judge films by 3D and Dolby Surround 7.2 etc...",1307145600,,1465,4.48689138576779

156480,5,0792844645,"Start with a superb play, add a brilliant cast, and wonderful cinematography, and you have one of the best films of the 20th Century. This film stands in sharp contrast to today's epics, which rely on unnatural settings contrived via CGI, as well as contemporary affectations, as directors try to give 10th Century characters 20th Century manners and morals.

O'Toole delivers one of his best roles on film as Henry Plantagenet, an old man of 50 trying to hold on to his life and his kingdom, and make a king out of his youngest son. Katherine Hepburn plays his older Queen, wrinkles and all, who schemes against him. And a very young Timothy Dalton, in his first film, is brilliant as the young Philip II, here to do battle with Henry II.

The dialogue is sharp, witty, and fast; one gets the impression that this is the play Shakespeare would have written had he lived in the 1960s rather than the 1500s. The acting is all top notch; there aren't any Hollywood faces there just to attract an audience. O'Toole and Hepburn were great stars in the 1960s, but they were also great actors.

I could go on, but I'll just say that this has been one of my favorite films since I was a teenager, and no doubt I'll keep watching it for as long as I can.",1303084800,6,1246,4.432314410480349
156481,5,0792844645,"A lot of people mention that this film seems hard to understand. Let's remedy that:

Eleanor of Aquitane, originally married to a French King (with two daughters) tired of him after an unsuccessful Crusade which they both led. She was able to have their marriage annulled thru the claim of consanguinity ... the discovery that they were too close as blood relatives for a legal marriage.

Six weeks later she married Henry of England, who was a marginally closer blood relative than her first husband.

Eleanor, thru various coincidences, had as a female come to the leadership position of Aquitane, the most wealthy region of France, and as a result she nominally controlled about a third of what is modern France.

Two years after she married Henry, he ascended to the Throne of England as Henry II. I believe that Eleanor figured she would not have long to wait to be queen.

She bore Henry II eight children, including five sons.

The eldest, another Henry, eventually embarked on a revolt against his father. Eleanor supported his revolt, which never really got close to succeeding. Henry the son eventually contracted dysentery in a war camp and died. For the crime of supporting the revolt, Henry II kept Eleanor locked away where she could do no political harm for 16 years.

You'll hear reference to just about all of the above during the course of this delightful stage play adapted to the screen. Tho probably too 'dull' for younger ears nowadays, this script is intelligent, witty, and encapsulates the resulting politics over the future of the throne into an entertaining nutshell.

Not only does it include an Oscar winning performance by Kate Hepburn, but Peter O'Toole vigorously gives us a good look at Henry II, who WAS vigorous. He expired at about the age of 56 as a result of injuries sustained during a jousting match! Early looks at Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton are quite interesting. Although Hopkins is instantly recognizable, the young and slim Dalton takes a bit to discover if you didn't already know he was in the film. His voice is quite recognizable, but he has yet to grow into the man who will play James Bond.

So you action and sex junkies can look elsewhere ... this film is not for you. Those who appreciate fine writing and acting for their own sakes will enjoy a two hour feast. :-)",1299110400,7,2327,4.754342431761787

Great Kate's most deserved of her four Oscars (although, ironically, she had to share it that year with that funny girl, Barbra Streisand) came with this movie. Frustratingly, Hollywood only remakes its few GOOD pictures, and so it was with ""Lion in Winter"" a couple of years ago... Was Glenn Close, in accepting the remake, only doing so as a retaliation against Hepburn's assertion that Close had ""big ugly feet""? If so, it was a mistake, as its Kate's shoes which are much too big to fill here.

I can always break out this picture every year or two. The original 1968 take on ""Lion in Winter"" is to Kate what ""All About Eve"" was to Bette Davis, and, I suppose, ""Mildred Pierce"" was to Crawford, and ""Double Indemnity"" was to Stanwyck: an incomparable diva at her very pinnacle of divadom.

Magnificent acting by Peter O'Toole (how could he not have won an Academy Award for his role as Henry II in this movie?) and Katherine Hepburn (who did win an Academy Award for her role). Wonderful depiction of the era and the personalities in power. Dialogue is extraordinary--perhaps because the story was a play before it became a movie. O'Toole is at his best and dominates every aspect of the story--much as he did playing the same role in ""Beckett"", another fine movie co-starring Richard Burton. Giving this movie five stars is inadequate--it deserves at least ten. May be my favorite move ever and ""Beckett"" is not far behind. If there is to be any criticism of this movie it is that Prince John, Henry's choice to succeed him, is portrayed as whiny and immature and even Henry knows that his older two sons will either control him or oust him.

With that being said, the Lion in Winter revolves around Henry II working out the succession to the crown with his surviving three sons, the King of France and Henry's wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. John (the Prince John of the Robin Hood stories) is a slob and not that bright, Geoffrey feels unappreciated and Richard (later known as Richard the Lionhearted) has problems all his own. King Louis of France feels as if he has been slighted and Eleanor has plots and schemes of her own. All of it serves for some interesting drama.

156499,5,0792844645,"This remarkable retelling of acerbic wits from James Goldman's play has as central focus the dazzling performance of Mrs. Katherine Hepburn who (to my mind made her most towering masterwork along her well known artistic trajectory) as Leonor of Acquitaine who matches with her lovely hated husband Henry II (Peter O' Toole). This tormented relationship of struggling power deals with the well known conflict of interests respect the next successor of the Royal crown. The King has his eyes focused in John (Nigel Terry) a very singled-mind and easily handled, while Leonor has her hopes centered on Richard (Anthony Hopkins in his debut) , but the the third son Geoffrey also aspires and so, after the previous agreement established by Henry II and the King of France Philip the state of things will reach its boiling point.

We will presence this dark plot of personal ambitions, unstoppable thirst of power, overpowering greediness, betrayal and double crosses. Father versus son, brother versus brother, mother versus sons; a true scorpions ` nest which reminds a twist of fate respect the monumental Shakespeare's ""King Lear"".

The semiotic language is another remarkable aspect to cite. Watch for instance two clever sequences, the first one when John is relegated by his father in the middle of a rough discussion, and falls close to a cage of pigs, giving a regrettable speech. The other deals when the King in the middle of the night irrupts through the subterranean levels of his castle where the dogs bark just when the Real guards make their appearance.

156500,5,0792844645,"The older I get the more I love this comedy-drama about the competition among the three sons of Henry II (Peter O'Toole) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katherine Hepburn), over who will succeed Henry as King of England (and, at the time, much of France). Henry keeps Eleanor locked up in prison in England most of the year while he pursues romances with much younger women, but he brings her over to France for annual his Christmas court, and the sparring begins. Eleanor favors the competent but possibly homosexual eldest son Richard; Henry favors spoiled, bizarre John. Middle son Jeff is not even under consideration, to his great resentment. All three of the sons are happy to work with the conniving King Philip of France to betray their parents to get what they want. Line after line of witty, thoughtful dialogue woven into a dense exploration of power, politics, and family relationships in medieval Europe. It's almost impossible to imagine such an intelligent, tightly focused script being filmed any more, not by the studios, not by the independents. The castle is authentically primitive with mud, straw-strewn floors and mangy-looking dogs wandering everywhere. Hepburn and O'Toole's performances may seem hammy to some, but the obvious delight they take in each other is infectious. Although their marriage was motivated by politics (England wanted the vast European territory Eleanor stood to inherit), theirs was for many years a true love match. It's heartbreaking as they look back from their old age at the passion they once shared and confront the horrors their sons have become. At the end, after all their manipulations and maneuverings against each other to try to ensure that John or Richard will succeed Henry, it's clear that Henry and Eleanor still have great affection and respect for each other.  Henry calls out to Eleanor as she sails back to her English jail, ""I hope we live forever."" You wish this remarkable, immensely entertaining couple would do just that.",1237248000,,1989,5.064024390243903
156501,5,0792844645,"This movie shares the top spot on my personal ten best list with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Play/screenwriter William Goldman had the idea of putting the spirit and dialogue of a Tennessee Williams/Edward Albee family-centered drama into a well known medieval setting: The household of Henry II, Plantagenet, of England, brilliantly played by Peter O'Toole, and it works unlike any other medieval period piece you've ever seen!

The Plantagenet family is as dysfunctional as anything you've seen in ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" or ""Suddenly Last Summer"", with covetous children, (""Excalibur's"" Nigel Terry, ""Blow-Up's"" John Castle and Anthony Hopkins, doing a bad Richard Burton imitation,) lusting after their parents' land and power, and a king who has imprisoned his wife, Queen Consort Eleanor of Aquitaine, mother of his three sons, for ten years due to conspiratorial behavior. This role is played by the brilliant Katherine Hepburn.

This is topped off by a near familial connection with the truly Machiavellian, newly crowned king of France, Philip II, played by an unrecognizable Timothy Dalton. He plays the Plantagenets like a harp, corrupting the oldest, Richard (yes, the ""Lionhearted"",) and holding the betrothal of his sister to Richard over Henry's head like the Sword of Damocles. Through all of this, Henry and Eleanor spar with each other AND their sons over the heirs they prefer to succeed Henry, the king PLAYING like he favors the gimpish John so as to get concessions out of Eleanor and Richard, and Eleanor favoring Richard, who she has apparently turned into the ultimate momma's boy. Both of them generally ignore the vastly more presentable and level headed Geoffrey, whom Henry and Philip see as a bit of a weasel. Geoffrey makes his resentment for generally being ignored by Henry and Eleanor known throughout the movie, and you have to wonder, as the brood is portrayed by the actors here, why DID they disdain him?! Henry states HIS take on Geoffrey pretty succinctly: ""Geoffrey...! There's a masterpiece! He isn't flesh, he's a DEVICE! He's wheels and GEARS...!""

The deep, personal bollides are thrown back and forth like ninja stars in this drama, gouging each character to the bone:

Henry:""How about a pillow, a shawl, a footstool....? Your oaths are all profanities, your word's a curse...your name on paper is a waste of pulp....! I'M VILLIFYING FOR GOD'S SAKE! PAY ATTENTION!!""

Eleanor: ""How many spindly, ricket-ridden, milky, wizened, dim-eyed, gammy-handed, limpid line of THINGS, will you beget?""

Eleanor: ""As for Richard's wedding day, we'll see the Second Coming first! The needlework alone could last for years....""

Geoffrey: (Dripping sarcasm) ""I know...you know I know...I KNOW you know I know. We know Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it. We're a knowledgeable family!""

Eleanor: ""Be Richard's chancellor!""

Geoffrey: ""Rot!""

Eleanor: ""Sons? That is the SINGLE THING of which I would think you've had enough! We could populate a country town with country girls who bore you sons! How many is it? Let me count the [...]!""

John: ""If I went up in flames, there isn't a living soul who would pee on me to put the fire out!""

Richard: ""Let's strike a flint and see...""

I'm not even sure ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" was this entertaining, dysfunctionality-wise!

Geoffrey and John ally themselves with Philip and things really get heavy as they witness the most shocking scene in the movie from behind a tapestry in Philip's guest quarters. This scene may actually be the basis for the erroneous assertion that Richard the Lionhearted was gay. He probably wasn't. If he were, and considering that this was roughly taking place during the same period as the Spanish Inquisition was getting started, chances are both Philip AND Richard would have been excommunicated SOOOO fast, their heads would have spun, if not been lopped off!

O'Toole and Hepburn chew the scenery like pros, and you'll wonder why O'Toole didn't win an Oscar for best actor for what is easily his best role ever. This film revived Hepburn's career, energized O'Toole's and launched those of Dalton, Hopkins and Terry. (And only won FIVE Academy Awards!)

NOWHERE will you find a more effective and entertaining movie with a medieval setting, and I defy you to come away from viewing this film without becoming a MAJOR fan of Peter O'Toole or Katherine Hepburn's prodigious acting talents!

156502,2,0792844645,"I was so excited to get this DVD and watch it, and was truly hoping to love this movie.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  The constant drama, scheming and wrangling, excessively verbose rambling dialogues and bellowing were non-stop.  Ambition was the only trait any character had.  The intensity was ratcheted very high, and never ebbed or flowed.  It was one dimensional the entire way through. The lines are often horribly delivered, by amazing actors no less, and I blame the script. While I understood the plot perfectly, I could not relate to any characters drive and motives, it was so overdone.  I couldn't summon up any emotional connection for these characters, except slightly for Princess Alais.
There were many main characters, 7 to be exact, and 0 other characters.  No secondary characters.  They basically had the screen all to themselves most of the movie.  Extras were rarely seen, and never had their characters developed.  No interesting ladies maids, castle servants, etc.  These 7 people were given pretty much the entire script.  This was better suited for the stage.

The makeup on Katherine Hepburn was horrendous.  Good lord, they weren't wearing makeup then, just wash the womans face and let her act.  The set was well done however, very believable, although it could have been a bit more elegant I thought, considering their stature as King and Queen.  It was very drab in coloring, and I realize this may have been to lend it authenticy, but they never took any opportunity to use color strategically.  In one scene, all three princes, plus the queen are standing together all wearing brown.  Nothing to break up the monotony.(Many period pieces can be colorful yet authentic, Braveheart, for example.) This movie came off more as an onstage play that happened to be filmed.  I was tired when it was over.  This will be going to the donation bin for me.  I will, however, give the Glenn Close/Patrick Stewart version a shot, as I really do love a good historical period piece.",1235779200,13,2014,4.916913946587537
156503,4,0792844645,"Originally created by writer James Goldman for the stage, THE LION IN WINTER opened on Broadway in 1966 with Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris in the leading roles--and in spite of critical admiration and obvious star power ran a scant 92 performances before closing with a box office thud. Even so, those who did see the play recalled it with tremendous interest, so it was not much of a surprise when the 1968 film version attracted two of the most famous names in cinema: Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. James Goldman adapted his original script for the screen, and the result was an Oscar-winner that lifted Henry II and Elenor of Aquataine out of stodgy history books and into mainstream conciousness.

Although the film was highly, highly praised at the time, and although it won numerous awards, seen today it has three flaws: Anthony Harvey's direction, Douglas Slocombe's cinematography, and John Bloom's editing, all of which wobble between merely acceptable and somewhat weak. In truth the ages of the actors are distinctly odd: Elenor was a decade older than Henry, and Hepburn is very obviously much too old and O'Toole much too young; and the ages of Anthony Hopkins, John Castle, and Nigel Terry are therefore just as out of place in the roles of their sons.

But none of this ultimately matters. Goldman's script is a masterpiece of history, contemporary zaps, and acid wit, and the cast plays it at full strength. Hepburn's performance is justly famous and among the most memorable of her entire career; O'Toole keeps pace and the ensemble follows suit.

The story concerns the bitter divide between Henry II and his queen Elenor, a woman of unequaled power and intelligence who was so annoyed with Henry's multiple affairs that she encouraged their sons to revolt against him--and came very close to knocking him off the throne. As the film begins, Henry has had her under lock and key for several years, lest she do it again; now, however, he summons her to his castle at Chignon for Christmas, and over the next few days they and their sons wrangle endless over which of the children should inherit the throne. The result is a very witty, very stinging portrait of a family that put the fun in disfunctional.

Although Goldman's version of this famous royal fued stays close to history, he is unapologetic in taking liberty with details; even the most casual historian knows perfectly well that Christmas wasn't celebrated in the 1100s at it is presented in this film, and indeed the whole thought that Henry would have bothered to temporarily release Elenor--much less seek her advice concerning their sons--is somewhat ify. But the whole thing is so beautifully written and played that one doesn't sweat the details. Any reviewer who does not also note the memorable score by John Barry, which adds so much to the film, would be highly remiss.

The film ends without resolution. If you are curious to know how it ultimately played out, upon Henry's death in 1189 the throne went to Richard Lionheart; Richard released Elenor, who actually ruled England on Richard's behalf during the crusades and who ultimately outlived all but two of her children: daughter Leonora, who became Queen of Castille; and son John, who ultimately inherited the English after Richard's death. John, of course, is best recalled as the king forced to sign the Magna Carta--and in folklore the cruel and wicked foe of the legendary Robin Hood.

Merry Christmas!

As a period film, it is a mix of accuracy and inaccuracy.  Henry II washing his face with ice water is a good touch, but the rest of his surroundings are unrealistically primitive.  12th century life was far richer than we give it credit for.  The castle should have been teeming with servants and retainers. The clothes are too simple and drab: trade routes imported materials and food as far afield as China. Henry II was arguably the most powerful man in Europe at the time--he controlled more land in modern France alone than the King of France did--and his surroundings would have reflected his status.

  Henry II, Eleanor, and their three living sons did indeed meet for Christmas in 1183.  But while the issues addressed--the question of succession and lordship of the Aquitaine--were real issues, the playwright has combined over 15 years of family strife into a couple days.

Henry II's fondness for his youngest son John is exaggerated: Henry wouldn't have dreamt of leaving the kingship to a younger son. The film shows John as having the IQ of a doornob, while administrative records from his reign indicate he was quite intelligent.

The film's portrayal of Richard is out of date: his weakness of character is entwined with his alleged homosexuality.  Also, primary sources indicate Richard was heterosexual; the theory that he was homosexual or bisexual is based on a modern interpretation of 12th century social norms.  To add insult to inaccuracy, the film shows Richard as a thick-skulled stubborn jock, while the primary sources I've read indicate he was a remarkably savvy politician and diplomat.

While it is historically misleading, The Lion in Winter provides a gripping interpretation of Plantagenet family dynamics, and is a worthwhile buy for anyone who appreciates talented stage-acting and acerbic dialogue.",1212969600,10,2715,5.7475
156508,5,0792844645,"This is one of the best movies made! As close to Shakespeare as you can get in modern times. The dialogue is incredible,especially in the interaction of Hepburn and O'Toole. They also seem to be having such a good time with it. The whole cast couldn't have been chosen more perfectly. The tension between the brothers as they back stab at the machinations of their parents is palatable. For lovers of historical drama this is a must.

156509,5,0792844645,"Katherine Hepburn is considered one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the big screen.  In fact, many of her devoted fans have coined the nickname `Kate the Great' when referencing this cinematic icon.  In this day and age of modern cinema being compared to this legend is one of the highest compliments any actress can hope to receive.  Sadly, I have not seen many of Hepburn's films and so I am really in the dark as to the extent of her talent.  But last night I sat down to watch `The Lion in Winter', a film I had heard much about but knew very little of.  I am now convinced, from just this single performance, that all the praise and admiration is justly deserved (as was that Oscar win).

With quick wit and a masterfully dead-panned delivery, Katherine Hepburn scorches the screen as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Achilles-Heel to her husband King Henry II.  Eleanor and Henry do not have the happiest marriage, Henry keeping Eleanor locked away for the majority of the year because of her rebellion against him.  He allows her to visit for the Christmas holiday and it is during this visit that tension abounds, tension that leads to betrayal and a total collapse of family.  While Eleanor is visiting she rallies behind their eldest son Richard for his right to the throne, but Henry is determined to make his youngest son John the next King.  Left in the middle is Geoffrey, perhaps the most cunning of all, who devises a way of secluding the throne for himself.

Adding to the internal tension within the family ranks is the pressure being put upon King Henry by King Philip of France to give his sister Alais' hand to Richard in marriage.  King Philip is a young King, but a crafty one and soon he is finding ways to destroy King Henry's rule from within his own castle walls.

The acting, for the most part, is flawless.  I've already mentioned my adoration of Katherine Hepburn's marvelous performance, but much must be said for Peter O'Toole as well.  It's still so shocking to me that he has yet to win an acting Oscar.  The Academy must feel really stupid right about now.  His fiery delivery as King Henry is brilliant to witness.  Anthony Hopkins, who makes his big screen debut here, is also a marvel to watch.  It's apparent from this early performance that he would one day become one of our greatest working actors.  His portrayal of the determined yet haunted Richard shows control and maturity beyond his experience.  Timothy Dalton also delivers a fine debut performance as King Philip, infusing enough charisma to make his cunning all the more believable.  Jane Merrow is sympathetic as Alais and John Castle is phenomenal as Geoffrey.  I was astounded by the depth he brought to his character, making him the most fascinating character in my humble opinion.  In fact, the acting in this film is so masterful that I am pained to have to single out Nigel Terry as the biggest drawback to an otherwise brilliant film.  His portrayal of John is excruciating to watch.  Instead of making John a believable buffoon he creates a campy feel that takes away from the impact of the film.  Thankfully the rest of the cast is so brilliant that they make up for his lack of impression.

I will add as a side note that I find it ironic how, while watching this movie, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to the marvelous Glenn Close when watching Hepburn, noticing how their acting style, even their facial features are very similar.  I say this is ironic because come to find out, Close also took on the role of Queen Eleanor in the TV adaptation of `The Lion in Winter'.

Small world.

Much has been said of the Oscar winning script by James Goldman (adapted from his stage play) and much should be said.  The dialog is tight and witty and, while the film is a tad wordy, it flows beautifully, remaining fresh and natural throughout.  Anthony Harvey directs the film with conviction and dedication, and it shows.  From the opening credits to the final frame he beautifully captures the mood presented by the subject.

`The Lion in Winter' is a stunning portrayal of the power of greed and the danger of power.  Watching this dysfunctional family crumble at its very foundation is unsettling yet captivating.  The film does to a degree feel dated; you can't escape that.  The sets and costumes and whatnot are not as fresh and vibrant as one would witness in modern cinema (the recent `The Other Boleyn Girl' is a marvelous example of how orgasmic these modern period films can look) but what doesn't feel dated is the marvelous performances and the smartly written and intricately woven script.

`The Lion in Winter' is a brilliant testament to the fact that no matter when a film was made, if it was made right it will stand the test of time.",1209600000,3,4769,4.632142857142857

We saw this film in the late evening and the magic of that night and the performances of the great cast were something to be remembered. The cast included the one and only Peter O'Toole, the great Katharine Hepburn, as well as Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Timothy Dalton. This film came at a time of some of the most powerful bellowing of Peter O'Toole and Anthony Hopkins revealed what a brilliant acting future he would have.

Hepburn and O'Toole, those giants of the acting world, play off each other with panache, vacillating between restraint and excess, love and hate.

However, watching and listening to three hours of family members scheming and screaming just made me tired.  Maybe it was only two hours but it seemed like much much longer.

156539,5,0792844645,"This is an unbelievably well acted movie with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole, whose characters are Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II, King of England. Included in this cast is Anthony Hopkins as an uncrowned Richard the Lion-Heart, and Timothy Dalton as King Philip II of France, and Nigel Terry as the ambitious but foolish Prince John. With the addition of the Geoffrey Duke of Brittany played by John Castle the group set themselves against one another seeking to manipulate  and use whatever political means available to secure the throne of England when Henry II, finally falls.  Each character is antagonistic towards the other and will stop at nothing at receiving the coveted prize.

Their hatred for one another is expressed in their endless plotting and continuous insulting of one another through witty sarcasm, and venomous spewing. The dialogue is truly what makes this drama entertaining, coupled with each character's attempt to dominate the other through secrecy and political intrigue. In their desire for blood, the pain of each character emerges through their acknowledgement of such, which has fueled the hatred and has embittered their lives. The cast truly engages with one another which truly engages us. It is both a riveting story and an interesting piece of historical fiction.

Note: The Lion in Winter has inspired many to discover more about Eleanor of Aquitaine (myself included). She was a woman who was a legend in her own time so much so that history has always referenced her to being of her homeland, Aquitaine, rather than the Queen of England or France, both of which were titles she possessed in her lifetime.",1187740800,2,1652,5.0625

Secondly, this gives you a taste of English history and insight into how turbulent the monarchy has ALWAYS been.

156560,4,0792844645,"'A Lion in Winter' has an irresistible match up between Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn.  Coming off like a comedic version of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woofe?' in royal proportions, 'A Lion...' has Henry II and Eleanor of Aquataine squaring off about which of their sons will succeed him when he dies.  Living with a mistress, Alais (Jane Merrow) most of the time anyway, Henry's tempestuous relationship with Eleanor is a thorn in each others' sides.  And, while it may be a matter of taste how much their disputes reach decibel levels, it is only proportionate to the wit and laughter it provides the audience.

Henry wants John (Nigel Terry) to succeed him (someone only a dim person couldn't perceive is immature.  His voice seems so common and whiney, I couldn't help but think of Eric Idle of Monty Python fame being equally suited for the role.)  Then, Eleanor prefers Richard (Anthony Hopkins!) her favorite.  He's more well-groomed, but doesn't have the manhood.  Geoffrey is the linch-pin, however; for like many families, the one who's scorned lives by his wits.  Indeed he does.  With Philip II of France (Timothy Dalton!) having a prolonged visit, the stakes of war over succession and negotiation up the ante quite a bit.

With a script that is often hysterical (in both senses of the word) and an able cast, 'A Lion in Winter' is hardly what I expected.  Instead of some sweeping epic with pomp and circumstance, we get an engaging ensemble that delivers great gifts, even from a royal family who seems needy and out of sorts during the holidays.",1172966400,2,1566,4.823970037453184

At first it was interesting and challenging, but at some point it went overboard and I lost interest.  Only O'Toole's Henry II character showed enough humanity that I cared what happened to him.

The movie provokes thought.  While this is a hypothetical Christmas, the real ones must have been something like this.  The facts of history are all on display, Alys and her dowery, the French king (son of Eleanor's first husband) ever ready to deal, the dubious sexuality of Richard, control of the Aquitaine, the naming of a successor before primogeniture was institutionalized, Henry's love child Geoffrey.  The casting is perfect especially Hepburn and O'Toole, I can't imagine any others in these roles. The acting, the sets, the costumes... first rate.  The ending is wonderful.

While the script is fantastic, it is only one reading of history.  While this family has to be as complex and dysfunctional as the movie portrays, I think it's hard on Eleanor.  She was a landed woman in her own right, and Henry was a philanderer of the first order, how SHOULD she have reacted? John might be overplayed as a simpleton, but when he does become king, he loses almost all of England's continental lands and signs away some rights of kings (Magna Carta).

Even if the script WERE less than brilliant, a cast such as this could most likely win awards just reading aloud from the Peoria, Illinois telephone directory.

Oh, and just in case you wonder what relevance this historically based film might have for us today, consider that it was John [eventually crowned king] who signed the ""Magna Carta"" in the year 1215.  This document was the first in British history in which a king agreed [admittedly under great pressure] to limit his monarchic power.

This, then, became the cornerstone of what was later to emerge as England's limited parliamentary monarchy and that of other nations as well.  It further becomes the inspiration for limited government in general and more specifically for that republic that was to eventually emerge in the colonies across the big pond, so to speak.

Consider also that Richard was to go on and become King Richard II, famous for his crusades to the Holy Land.

156566,5,0792844645,"It is the Christmas season of the year 1183 and England's wise but mercurial king, the aging Henry II, greatest figure in Europe since the death of Charlemagne, does what any good father would: he gathers his feuding family together for the holidays. Ah, but this is not merely any royal family, it is the Plantagents, a clan into whose roiling hearts treachery and violence have been bred as a way of life. There is Henry's oldest surviving son, Richard, later King Richard the Lionhearted, a cruel man who lives for war. There is also Henry's middle son, the cold, calculating Duke Geoffrey, and lastly, Henry's favorite, the spineless, conniving brat of the brood, the seemingly foolhardy but inwardly clever teenaged John, whom Henry wishes to one day succeed him as king. And above all this there is the greatest woman of the twelfth-century, Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, Henry's wife, whom Henry has locked away in a castle for much of the recent past, revenge for one of Eleanor's many attempts to wrest the kingdom from her much younger husband, a man she loves and hates with vying, passionate emotion. So into the mix they all go, each of these four dangerous individuals wishing to either wear the crown or see that a favored child does so.

Called together to celebrate the festive season, Henry's family hosts a rival king, the cerebrally-adept Philippe Auguste of France, barely more than a boy but clearly quite taken with being king. It is to Philippe's lovely sister, Alais, that Henry's son Richard is nominally betrothed, but whom Henry has amorally made his mistress for the past several years. Philippe arrives with a demand: marry his sister to Richard at once---in effect making his future nephew king of England---or return those substantial French territories Philippe's father turned over to Henry as Alais' dowry. In an odd twist of feudal legalities, Henry, himself a king, is also a vassal of Philippe, even though there is the curious fact that Henry controls virtually as much of France as Philippe himself does. In their negotiations Henry dismisses Philippe as an inexperienced boy, and Philippe in return explains the cruel math of their situation, that simply put, time is on his side, and all he has to do is wait for Henry, a lion in winter, to die. When the two monarchs reach an impasse on the matter of Princess Alais, Philippe is only too ready to deal with Henry's plotting sons and wife, and the deal-making, each scheming side trying to gain better terms than the other, is a thing of great beauty to behold: like a venomous dance of dueling cobras.

In one poisonously-contested night the lives of each of the six principle figures of The Lion In Winter will be irrevocably changed, and how they all reach their end-points is an intricate tale well worth seeing. The performances in this production are without flaw, the dialogue is spoken in a rapid-fire pace simply unseen in films today---""When the king's off his arse, no one sleeps!""--- and the settings, all created in an age before computerized digital effects, are on a sweeping scale.

In the end one gets the sense that Henry, a man who conquered everything but time itself, a force against which no one is safe, was THEE man of his age, as Caesar was before him, Leonardo later was in his, or Bonaparte farther along.  And yet we watch as despite all his stubborn brilliance the world Henry has made closes in on him through the course of one familial betrayal after another. Though The Lion In Winter ends on what passes for an optimistic note, anyone familiar with English history of the time knows, as Henry did not, what came next, and that shadow this knowledge casts across the near-jollity of the closing scene makes the conclusion all the more poignant.

Simply one of the greatest films that will ever be shot.",1158278400,22,3827,4.792424242424242
156567,5,0792844645,"I remember seeing this amazing film one day years ago and I recently rediscovered it. Henry II is the aging King of England whose oldest son and heir has died and so he must name a new heir. So he summons his family to Christmas court: His eldest son Richard is an able soldier, his politically astute middle son Geoffrey, and the spoiled youngest son John who Henry loves the best are the contenders for the throne. Also summoned are Henry's wife Eleanor who has been imprisoned in a tower, the young King of France Phillp and his sister Alais who is Henry's ward and mistress. All these characters have a different stake in the outcome of who becomes Henry's heir as they fight, plot and backstab to get their contender to the throne.

Some reviews have called his movie ""wordy"" and to be fair it is light on action but it is heavy on intrigue and almost every line in the script (especially those of Henry and Eleanor) is pure magic. The casting is superb with Peter O'Toole as Henry and Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor (She won an Oscar for this role). Look also for young Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry and Timothy Dalton. I highly recommend this intelligent and well casted costume drama to everyone.",1157155200,,1201,4.560185185185185
156568,5,0792844645,"This has to be my all-time favortie move.  Singlehandedly it sparked my interest in British history.  I saw it first in a theater and was overwhelmed, remembered it, and got a VHS version as soon as I was able.  I have probably watched it at least 50 times since.

Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are just SUPURB as Eleanor and Henry.  Henry Plantagenet's rages were the stuff of legend during his lifetime, and the way O'Toole plays him you can see why.  Why Peter O'Toole didn't get an Oscar for this I can't fathom.  He IS Henry, as Eleanor says ""With a mind like Aristotle and a form like mortal sin,"" just as Katherine Hepburn IS Eleanor, ""I married out of love a woman out of legend...""  It is almost like they channeled the personalities of these long-dead monarchs from the ether.  Eleanor:  ""I rode bare-breasted half way to Damascus.  Louie had a seizure and I nearly died of windburn....but the troops were dazzled.""

I agree with the previous reviewer that Nigel Terry plays a dumbed-down, almost cariciture of John.  John Castle plays Geoffrey to a ""T"", just how you would imagine him, caught between Richard and John, and coming up short in his parent's regard.  My only quarrel with anyone in the cast is Anthony Hopkins.  He is a wonderful actor, maybe it was the director, but he just doesn't seem right for this part.  The historical Richard oozed charisma and confidence, this Richard seems more stolid and repressed, but that's probably just me, since no one else seemed to have a problem with how he was portrayed.  Though I will say that in the chamber scene with King Phillip and Henry he is outstanding.  Timothy Dalton as Phillip is just perfect.

The dialogue is amazingly crisp and witty, and the attention to historical detail has been well-researched.  This movie has an almost intimate feeling to it, as if you are watching the machinations and plotting of a very dynamic and even more dysfunctional family who just happen to rule England, Ireland and half of France.  This has to rank up there with one of the finest films ever made.",1154390400,7,2068,4.673130193905817
156569,4,0792844645,"This is an interesting take on the relationship of King Henry II of England and his wife and Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Based upon a stage play by James Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay for the film and won an Oscar for his efforts, it has the feel of theatre to it, rather than film.

Here, Henry and Eleanor are in their golden years. Henry is fifty and his wife, whom he has had imprisoned for the last ten years, is several years older. He brings her out of captivity for Christmas, and she joins him and their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey, and John.

Peter O'Toole gives a fine portrayal of the aging, but still robust and virile, Henry, who is in a seeming quandary as he debates a burning issue. To whom of his three sons shall he leave his hard won kingdom? He professes to want to leave it to his youngest, John, as that is the son whom he claims to love the most. One has to wonder, however, what kingly qualities he sees in John, played as a pimply faced, sixteen year old fool by Nigel Terry, who does what he can with this unsympathetic role.

Eleanor, however, tartly played by the always glorious Katherine Hepburn, prefers her oldest, Richard, who is the son whom she has loved the most, though he, too, has his issues. Richard is played as a blood thirsty homosexual by a somewhat wooden Anthony Hopkins in his screen debut.

No one seems to love the middle son, Geoffrey, and he knows it, though he seems to be the one son whose behavior is the most within the bounds of what one might consider acceptable, as he is neither a killer nor a fool. He is merely unloved by his parents. John Castle gives a strong performance in this role.

Eleanore manipulates each of her three sones, as if they were pawns in a game of chess, in her quest for personal power. Henry also play them like fiddles. They, in turn, seem to care little for her or their father. It is no wonder that they are totally disfunctional as a family.

Also, living in the castle is the beautiful Alais, sister to the young King of France, Philip II, played by Timothy Dalton in a very credible debut performance. Betrothed to Richard fifteen years before at the age of seven, Alais has since fallen in love with Henry, and he has made her his mistress. Eleanor is fully aware of the fact, and Henry flaunts her with gusto. Alais is played with warm tenderness by the lovely Jane Morrow, who is eclipsed by the highly intelligent and ruthlessly clever Eleanor. Yet, it is Alais whom the King professes to love.

Still, one has to wonder. It seems that Henry and Eleanor have very strong feelings for each other, which are veiled by a mask of supposed hatred and disguised by the venom that they spout at each other. The dialogue between the two protagonists is sharp and bitter repartee, which is delivered fast and furious, reminiscent of the dialogue spewed forth in Edward Albee's play ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".

Eleanor and Henry parry back and forth the entire film, each trying to vanquish the other verbally. The two aging monarchs are aware that they are coming to terms with their own respective mortality, yet each is loath to let go of the trappings of their greatness, no matter what the cost. Hepburn and O'Toole ham it up with over the top performances, though given the excesses of the dialogue, which is often witty and full of ripostes that go for the jugular, it is as the author wished.

An interesting and clever film that will be enjoyed by all those who love theatre, period pieces, and historical dramas.",1147564800,,3528,4.5

Cue daggers, plots and reopened wounds as everyone tries to kill everyone else and nobody gets what they wanted for Christmas. Part costume drama, part Who's Afraid of Eleanor of Aquitaine? as these jungle creatures scratch and claw at each other's weak spots and almost certainly a lot closer to history as it was lived than as it is written thanks to a truly great screenplay by James Goldman (who stumbled across the plot while researching a play about Robin Hood that would later become the sadly underrated Robin and Marion) that's done justice by it's cast. Katherine Hepburn may have got the Oscar, but Peter O'Toole before the rot set in, reprising and bettering his role from Beckett, matches her tooth and claw, with Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton and John Castle picking up a few tricks en route. The weak links are the reliably awful Nigel Terry's overstated John and Jane Merrow's Alais, a performance as flat as her singing voice, but as they are required to be simpletons and ciphers they don't get in the way.

Henry and Eleanor have been battling for years - she's tried to overthrow him more than once.  She is imprisoned in a castle and brought out for state occasions and holidays.

It's Christmastime and Henry is allowing Eleanor out for the festivities.  Of course, also attending is his current paramour, Alais.  But the problem really is her brother Philip, King of France is also attending and he wants Henry to marry his sister to one of his sons.

The son who marries Alais will be the next King of England.  A marriage to Richard, Eleanor's favorite son, would make him too powerful.  Therefore, he favors the weaker son, John.  Therefore, all three sons are vying for her.

This creates a lot of backstabbing and treachery including from Philip.  The only pawn seems to be Alais.

The writing is delightfully wicked.  Hepburn and O'Toole just eat it up and both give their best performances.  This is a master class in acting, screenwriting and directing.  This film will keep you on the edge of you seat waiting for the next turn.

My favorite line is when Henry storms out of Eleanor's quarters saying he is going kill all their sons.  Eleanor throws herself at Henry and just misses grabbing him and say ""Well every family has their ups and downs.""

156574,5,0792844645,"I saw this movie in a theater when it was first released. I have also seen it about four or five times since on TV. Trust me, the big screen is much better, but even on TV, this movie has such incredible depth that it will be around for many years to come. The somewhat recent TV production with Patrick Stewart and Geln Close as Henry and Eleanor was very good, but not in the same league as Peter O'Toole's Henry and Katherine Hepburn's Eleanor.

This film has perhaps some of the most crisp and witty dialog I've ever heard. I always thought Peter O'Toole should have got an Oscar for his work in this film, and also for his excellent work in Beckett.

Set in 1183 in England, the film portrays the venemous relationship between Henry and Eleanor and their three sons, John Geoffrey and Richard. Beneath the venom and hurt is something of a bond of love between Eleanor and Henry that unfolds throught the film. Also, not to be missed is a young Anthony Hopkins as Richard, who in history is the Richard The Lion Heart who goes to the crusades, and in his absence England is ruled by his brother John, aho in 1215 is forced to sign the Magna Charta.

There are so many excellent reviews of this film that I feel inadequate to improve on them. Let me just say that if you want to spend a couple hours watching two of the world's greatest actors work with a sparkling script and an outstanding set, then get this movie. I don't see how you will disappointed.",1132012800,2,1459,4.356617647058823
156575,5,0792844645,"It's 1183. Henry II has summoned his wife and children to join him for the Christmas holiday. It's not for the joy of their company, for this family is unhappy in its own toxic way. This movie lays that toxicity bare, then sends these unhappy people back where they came from.

I love this movie. It's become my family's traditional Christmas movie (a tradition that my kids would probably jettison if they could, but if I have to watch The Aristocats every Saturday, they have to watch The Lion in Winter once a year). The dialogue, the acting, the scenery, it all comes together in one wonderful whole, which is odd because the parts really aren't all that wonderful.

The dialogue is relentlessly witty. A small amount of wit makes dialogue sparkle, but this movie is one brilliant one-liner after another. Even poor John (presented here as a much bigger dolt than the historical evidence justifies) gets off the occasional zinger. I enjoy the verbal torrent, but sometimes it makes me feel like I'm drowning in the words.

The actors seem to love their lines; they deliver them with relish. They chew on them, roll them around, wallow in them, declaim and shout and hiss them with shameless promiscuity. Overacting? Oh, yes. But this was a stage play before it was a movie, and it may be that the exaggerated emotion that's necessary on stage was carried into the film out of force of habit.

The setting and scenery are dreary, though there are some lovely shots at the beginning and end of the movie when Eleanor arrives and then leaves by water. The castle looks cold and uncomfortable - in a word, authentic. It's a place where a family can fall apart with bitter recriminations all around and not make the house any more unpleasant a home than it already is.

All that is beside the point, because the elements of this movie come together in a beautifully harmonious way. Through all the anger and bitterness we can see the embers of the love that bound Henry and Eleanor. Their sons are cold and cynical and manipulative, but we sense the regret, the love that might have been, if only the royal court weren't so cold and deadly a place. The story is sad, but it shines with humor and that endless torrent of wit. The acting is over the top, but the actors play characters who are grander and meaner than life, people whose lives are over the top.

Katharine Hepburn is radiant in this film; Peter O'Toole is magnificent. Nigel Terry is deliciously low as John, and Anthony Hopkins is a sadly damaged Richard. There was no one in this film I didn't like, either as a character or as an actor.

This isn't a film for people who want action or subtlety in their movies (thought it does have both). You have to enjoy a certain amount of chattiness, not mind scenes that don't actually lead anywhere. What you'll get in return is an ultimately optimistic view of life, which for all its pettiness and disappointments can always hold out the promise of something grand and wonderful.",1131667200,2,2988,4.6158192090395485

And this in spite of the fact that like ""A Man for All Seasons"" there is not any action in the film, just on-stage dramatic tension.  The second time through years later, the film still captivates, but not with the same overpowering force.  It came across now more as a typical battle of the sexes in a marriage gone sour.  Some say this is a historical piece.  Not really.  It is 20th-century Freudian psychology dressed up in 12th-century clothes.

When I first saw the Lion in Winter in Western Civ class, I thought it was the worst movie I'd ever seen. The rest of the class seemed to be in agreement. After a second viewing, I offer a full retraction. The story is actually very good, as are most of the performances. Unfortunately the film lacks the focus to be effective. While most of the actors did a good job in his or her own right, the chemistry between characters is on the level of a middle school production of Shakespeare.

Some of the scenes have a Python-esque charm to them, but the direction doesn't compliment it. And it shouldn't. It's not meant to be a spoof, but the more serious scenes lack the intensity of anything better. One of the biggest problems with the film is that it provides no emotional anchor with which the viewer can sympathize. It also sidesteps the personal conflicts in favor of portraying stategy. The result is like watching complete strangers playing chess. Today I also viewed Bergman's The Seventh Seal for the first time, a movie about a knight who plays chess with Death. It far surpasses this film in every way, shape, and form.

If those who made The Lion in Winter understood the material to the degree that Bergman did, this could've been a great film. As is, it is a valiant attempt but an ultimate failure.",1124582400,9,1505,4.525735294117647
156581,5,0792844645,"Anthony Harvey, who replaced George Cukor as Katharine Hepburn's favorite director during this period, had his work cut out for him just keeping a cast of hotheads in line.  O'Toole and Hepburn get most of the plum dialogue, though Anthony Hopkins does well with his portion.  Henry gets sarcastic and nasty, always taking the dim view of things, whereas Eleanor is more pragmatic and even optimistic.  Who can forget their exchange about hell freezing over?  ""The day those stout hearts band together is the day that pigs get wings,"" he raves.  She takes a moment, glances mischievously, and replies, ""There'll be pork in the trees come morning.""  Indeed the movie is one long debate about human nature and how and if it came be improved.

When I was a boy my favorite play was Goldman's LION IN WINTER and Dad took me to the Broadway version which starred Rosemary Harris, then very young, probably not even thirty yet, and she was outstanding.  It was hard to see how a woman so young could have given birth to three grown sons.  In the Broadway cast some of the sons were probably older than Harris.  But as anyone knows, she is an extremely powerful actress with a sort of ageless craggy look.  Probably even as a baby she never looked young, and she was perfect as Eleanor.

Another prominent reviewer credits ""Julie"" Harris with creating the part on the stage.  No sir, I'm afraid you've got your Harrises mixed up.  I like Julie Harris as an actress too, but the play would have ground to a halt with Julie Harris and her fey sweetness playing the tough as nails Eleanor of Acquitaine.

The play was great, but it didn't have Katharine Hepburn, and it didn't have the fantastic brass and metal clanging choral work of John Barry's famous film score.  That music won't let you rest; more than any other element it brings the past into the action of the movie in an almost visceral way.

I was in high school when The Lion in Winter was released.  I had not so long before seen Becket, also starring O'Toole (with Richard Burton), and was looking forward to a much more action-oriented, swash-buckling movie than is The Lion in Winter.  So I recall being disappointed with the endless talking much of which didn't make sense to me, the dark scenes and the nastiness of the characters.  Not much medieval spleandor!

Well, that was in my impatient, impetuous youth.  Now that we live in the DVD age these old gems can be brought out for reappraisal.  The film requires a certain level of maturity and patience to be appreciated, but once that threshold is reached the rewards of this movie are rich and manifold.

The film rates as one of my favorites.  Though I respect the Halliwell Film and Video Guide (which, happily, is very grudging with the stars), it grossly underrates this wonderful movie (giving it one star, when it should rate at least three).

The main problem of the story is transitioning the monarchy from an aging king to a successor.  The way this up-for-grabs power struggle effects the characters is brilliantly presented in dialog and acting.  The King tries out one decision out after another: first one prince, then another, will inherit the throne, then, realizing that all of his sons display varying levels of treachery, the King decides he needs a new heir.  He will go to Rome for a divorce so he can remarry to have more sons.  But that won't work since all the princes and the Queen threaten to revolt.

The King's dithering has a corrosive effect on the characters which is fascinating to watch.  The trust and distrust of each individual to the others, the loyalty or betrayal to the King and the current favorite causes great volatility in the alliances between characters.

The story is, finally, a tragedy.  It's the tragedy of growing old, of realizing that one doesn't live forever and will never know, much less control, how the world will turn out when one is gone.  The tragedy of being shunted aside (as is the imprisoned Queen), of seeing your children not live up to your expectations and then become disloyal.  The tragedy for two of the three princes not chosen to rise to the throne.

At the end of the story, nothing is decided. Life will go on as before.  The Queen is on her way back to jail.  But the King and Queen have learned that they are companions in their mutual tragedy.  In the midst of this sorrow the lighthearted way they part brings a tear to the eye.  Indeed, their final fairwell is a triumph over dispair.",1123200000,4,2768,4.6460905349794235

For the House of Henry II Plantagenet is a dysfunctional and quarrelsome one, and the ageing monarch wishes to appoint a suitable heir to the throne amidst this background.

Queen Eleanor of Aquataine (Katharine Hepburn), whom Henry has imprisoned for many years, connives to install her favourite son, Prince Richard the Lionheart (Anthony Hopkins). Henry would be amenable to this except that Richard had a homosexual relationship with King Philip of France (Timothy Dalton), and consequently he favours Prince John (Nigel Terry), his teenage, albeit half-witted son. Prince Geoffrey (John Castle), the aloof and least loved heir, plays a cat-and-mouse game with his parents and brothers simply for the pleasure of tormenting them. It is a tempestuous situation to say the least, yet therein lies the beauty of ""Lion in Winter"".

To witness the exchange of dialogue and brinkmanship between O'Toole and Hepburn is hypnotic, as are the performances of a young Anthony Hopkins and Nigel Terry.  You can't help but be consumed and drawn into this royal family's emotional roller-coaster and feel sympathetic for their plight. Timothy Dalton (aka James Bond), in a rather lacklustre performance, makes his film debut in this film. But it is Hepburn and O'Toole who hold this film together.

The script, costumes, scenery and photography are excellent. Although, I am inclined to agree with the director, Anthony Harvey, the film's weakness lies in the occasional zoom shot. But then, I don't suppose many viewers would notice it unless it was called to their attention.

Anthony Harvey's scene by scene account, which may be heard while the movie plays, is an insightful footnote into his editing, directing style and rapport with his actors. He sheds light on how he created the mood for merry olde England; how he let the camera roll allowing the actors to perform at length uninterrupted; and how the actors prepared for their roles and worked as a family.

Suffice it to say, ""Lion in Winter"" is King Henry II's winter of discontent. It is one man's tragic realisation in the winter of his life that he can only survive so long as he is politically and physically strong. There can never be -- and history shows there never was -- any compromise for Henry II. It is this honest and realistic depiction of his life and family that makes the story for ""Lion in Winter"" so compelling, so fantastic.",1121990400,3,2562,5.0

156587,5,0792844645,"Anthony Harvey directs this 1968 film based on a screenplay by James Goldman on the reigns of Henry II of England (Peter O'Toole) and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katherine Hepburn.)  The film is more a theatrical piece as it is shot almost entirely in a studio/indoors and is also equally devoid of any action besides dialogue: but what great dialogue! Worthy even of the Bard's applause!

In the late 12th century, the royal Norman family of Anjou/Plantagenet is in a squabble.  Eleanor D'Aquitaine is hostage to her husband Henry II in an English castle and each place their weight with their sons to ensure their prosperous reign in the years to come.  Princes John (Nigel Terry: Arthur in 'Excalibur') and Richard (Anthony Hopkins) come to meet their feuding parents on Christmas Eve to discuss the succession to the throne. Intrigue is plenty as each monarch seeks to win the allegiance of their favorite son: one prefers the fierce Richard while the other prefers the moody Prince John.  There's also a brief appearance by the King of France Philippe Le Bel (Timothy Dalton.)  Again, the film has no action and the scenes are primarily limited to Eleanor's place of confinement.  The script/dialogues are excellent and filled with passion and intrigue.  A great film showing the woes of monarchy and succession and the intrigues of Medieval courts.

This is a powerful drama providing a good glimpse into the complexities of Medieval dynasties and English/French history.  The disputes represented in the film were never really settled as Henry's marriage to Eleanor would later become the grounds of the Hundred Years War between England and France during the 14th-15th centuries.  This film is ideal for audiences who either like history and/or theatrical dramatic plays as opposed to purely action-based Hollywood drama. For a good fictional novel on this subject, I would recommend Maurice Druon's saga titled 'Les Rois Maudits' (English translations are available) covering the dynastic reigns of England and France during the Middle Ages: an excellent work of literature.  For a romantic novel on this period, the best is probably Sir Walter Scott's 'Ivanhoe' which covers in rich and abundant detail all of the nuances of English culture/politics during that period of time.",1115078400,3,2291,5.1455525606469

This movie is gripping and mesmerizing.  The dialogue is so clever and well written with lots of dark wicked humor.  There is fighting between Eleanor and King Henry II, a dysfunctional family, all the sons fighting for the throne and lots of conniving, backstabbing and scheming.  What more can you ask for?  The acting is superb.  It's one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion and one of my favorites.  If you are a history buff, you have to see this movie.

The movie is definitely 1960s in style and design, but it doesn't distract from the pure pleasure of this dramatic version of the reign of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, brilliantly played by Peter O'Toole and Oscar winner Hepburn.

Timothy Dalton and Anthony Hopkins strut their early promise with vigor.  Too bad one or both of them couldn't have been enticed to reunite for a commentary track.  It would also have been nice to include a bonus feature with some historical information on the real-life characters portrayed.

All the best laid plans of mice and men.  Naturally, there are resentments among the boys as to who should succeed Henry and Eleanor gleefully stokes the fire of this powderkeg.  To say sparks fly is an understatement.  The raw emotion on display here is a virtual inferno and the only beneficiary is a delighted audience.  Anthony Harvey colorfully transfers James Goldman's play to the screen.  O'Toole, who in my mind deserved the Oscar for his work here, literally explodes on the screen as Henry.  He is literally a lion personified.  Hepburn, who did win the Oscar, gives a multi-hued performance here.  Yes, she is devious and unrelenting, but there is an underlying sadness in her character.

One this list goes ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", Brando and Leigh I've always felt are almost battling over who will be more memorable, or ""Rachel, Rachel"" Woodard just seems to be that character nothing more can be said or Gena Rowlands in ""A Woman Under the Influence"" then there are modern film such as ""21 Grams"". I thought ""Grams"" was the best film of 2003 strongly because of the acting and here we have Anthony Harvey's ""Lion in Winter"" and once again I'm blown away. How this movie lost the Academy Award to ""Oliver"" makes my head spin. Here, without doubt is the best film of 1968.

 Originally a play written by James Goldman, who also adapted his own screenplay, is a film that reaches a Shakespearian level of drama. Like Shakespear we have a story that deals with lust, greed, and revenge.

 King Henry II (Peter O' Toole) must decide which of his three sons will be his succesor. He has his own favorite, as does his wife Eleanor (Katherine Hepburn). Soon the sons are plotting against one another and their father. Meanwhile Henry and Eleanor are at each other's throat as their marriage is one in name only.

 The way the cast, which includes Anthony Hopkins (making his screen debut) and Timothy Dalton, Jane Merrow and John Castle actually seem to become these characters is the strenght of the film.

 In trying to be objective and present both sides to you I'm finding it difficult to think of the film's flaws. If anything perhaps the ending is disappointing only because we thought there was a resolution between two of these characters. But, other than that I can't think of any other flaws to point out.

 The movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won three; ""best actress"", ""best screenplay"", and ""best score"". To me this is one of the ultimate masterpieces.

 Bottom-line: A masterpiece that hits a level of drama only matches by Shakespear. Has some of the most powerful acting you will find in a Hollywood film.",1109548800,3,2096,4.619946091644205
156592,5,0792844645,"See my review of the 2004 remake as contrast.

This is, simply put, the greatest movie I have ever seen.

Peter O'Toole is exactly how I pictured Henry II: arrogant and volatile, yet somehow sympathetic; he can calmly discuss one minute and roar the next like the titular character he is. Hepburn as Eleanor is brilliant, a latter-day Helen whose beauty has long since started to fade, living to scheme against Henry and to manipulate her sons against him and against one another. The supporting cast, including the debut performances of Timothy Dalton and Anthony Hopkins, is similarly spectacular. Let's just say this is Richard the Lionhearted as you never imagined him.

But the acting skill of the cast is only half of the game; part of the genius of this film lies in its dialogue. There is almost no action and yet never a dull moment (this from someone who likes big explosions as much as the next theatergoer). The quips and jokes, jabs and insults, are delivered with impecable timing.

My favorite exchange:

Henry (roaring, and dripping with sarcasm): How was your crossing? Did the sea part for you?

Eleanor (calmly, and equally sarcastic): It went flat when I told it to. I didn't think to ask for more.

King, Queen, Princes John, Richard, and Geoff, King Phillip of France and his sister, Alais all wrestle for position in this 'not for the faint of heart' family drama.

Henry and Eleanor are two of the most fascinating people in history.  O'Toole and Hepburn bring them to life in a manner recognizable to anyone who cares to watch.  Henry and Eleanor are the moon and sun and the supporting players revolve around them. These are two powerful people who started their relationship in a blaze of passion. Henry was a young Duke who wanted it all -- a kingship and the French Queen Eleanor. The older Eleanor already had a king and the  richest duchy in Europe but she wanted Henry -- their adultery and the subsequent divorce and war made it all possible.  They ruled together and apart and ultimately they turned on one another and did terrible things to each other.  BUT after all of the venom, backstabbing, etc. at the end there is the fundamental truth that Henry and Eleanor love one another but so much has happened to them, they cannot live together because they cannot trust one another.  Hepburn and O'Toole make you believe them when they are trying to  verbally destroy one another and, in their tender moments, make you feel the love that is still there. Kate won the Oscar for this performance which is one of her finest.  She is regal, beautiful, intelligent, domineering, scheming, and alone -- the personification of Eleanor.  O'Toole is strong, cunning, wicked, and resourceful.  You can believe that this man could have been bold enough to commit adultery with the Queen of France just as you can believe that this woman would have risked possible execution to consummate their passion.  You believe that love and hate are two sides of the same coin depending on the circumstances.  In this film, the coin spins as the circumstances change.  This was Katharine Hepburn's first film role after the death of the love of her life Spencer Tracy, I think she brought the knowledge of great love and loss to this role and in doing so created an indelible performance that everyone else in the cast rose to meet.",1097798400,10,2116,4.777472527472527

The film is absolutely electric whenever O'Toole and Hepburn share a scene.

156598,5,0792844645,"I was so thrilled to see that A Lion in Winter received top viewer remarks.  If any movie deserves unfaltering adoration, this one does!  I've seen it so many times I can practically recite the dialogue, but it is still riveting.  If I can influence just one person to see this movie, I'll be happy.

For history addicts like myself, this movie is satisfying beyond words.  Every brief mention, every conversation, and every dredged up life story is totally dead-on.  Regardless of your feelings toward period-films, A Lion in Winter is worth every second you devote to its viewing.  (This movie is NOT a dried-up classic.  It's as alive as any modern-day melodrama- more so.)

Katharine Hepburn IS Eleanor of Aquitaine.  And Peter O'Toole is absolutely amazing as Henry II.  I loved the depiction of all three sons, although I was less than fond of Alais.  (The character, not the actress.)  Geoffrey, in particular, stood out- I can't imagine why the actor appeared in so few productions.  And of course, Phillip of France was a great addition to the plot.  Timothy Dalton is perfect for any number of historical roles (such as Llewelyn Fawr).

Finally, the most amazing element of the movie is the dialogue.  These characters actually come to life, in more ways than you'd think possible.  This is history's most dysfunctional family, after all.

And if you're looking for a brief explanatory note, here goes:  Henry II, King of England, celebrates Christmas in Normandy with his wife and sons, while battling out the succession with all three of them- plot twists ensue.  The year is 1183, and Queen Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine and former Queen of France has been temporarily released from her castle-prison.  This impetuous, intelligent, and plainly notorious Queen was first imprisoned ten years earlier... why?  For plotting rebellion while aiding and abetting her treacherous young sons.  Henry also has to deal with a seventeen-year-old king of France- the surprisingly adept and politically savvy Phillip I.  And while all three sons clamor for the throne, Henry practices his gifts for stalling and posturing, promising the world to youngest son John while refusing to give up so much as an acre of his empire.  Eleanor throws herself whole-heartedly into the race, willing to do anything to see her favorite son Richard crowned.

156602,5,0792844645,"'There'll be pork in the treetops come morning!'
Thus shouts Queen Eleanor of Acquitaine to King Henry II, in a shouting match that never ends during the course of the fabulous film. An inventive historical drama recounting the lives of several of medieval Europe's most colourful characters, I can scarce begin to list the number of lines that stand out from the banter.
`The Lion in Winter' has long been one of my favourite films. I never tire of watching it, and love to find opportunities to incorporate lines from the film into my own `witty banter' as appropriate. Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, in performances nearly unequalled by either in other works, provide the main action, while the very young actors Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton help fill out the cast in their debut roles (Nigel Terry, later to play King Arthur in 'Excalibur', also plays one of the king's sons). Done in period costume and set (the King emerging from his castle, not on a red carpet, but rather striding among the chickens scrambling to escape the regal steps), there is an air of realism to the visual production that is rarely achieved in more stately presentations of 'lofty' history. There are interesting asides, not the least of which is that King Henry seems make reference to being a bisexual -- a very daring thing in the 1960s, as well as the rumoured love affair between Richard (Richard the Lionhearted) and the King of France. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, it won three, including best screenplay -- no wonder so many delightfully witty, pithy lines come from this film.
The real history of Henry and Eleanor provides the backdrop here. Henry kept Eleanor, one of the most desirable women (apparently in form as well as property) in Europe, a virtual prisoner during much of the later part of his reign. After his eldest son Henry died (an heir crowned in the lifetime of Henry II, a rare thing among monarchs, done in part because of the church-state problems dating back to Thomas Becket, alluded to very briefly in the dialogue of the film), Henry needs a new successor. Contrary to popular belief, the succession does not automatically proceed down the ranks of the eldest children (this would arise as an issue again during Tudor times, when there was first the attempt to skip over Mary and Elizabeth in favour of Lady Jane Grey; then later, the Stuart claim comes from their having been skipped over previously, by some definitions).
Of course, Richard (Anthony Hopkins) expects to be the heir - next in line, he is also the best soldier and general. Henry (for some unknown reason) prefers John (Nigel Terry), the youngest. Geoffrey (John Castle) is all but forgotten - history will have him die prior to Henry in any event, but he has the poignant line that speaks of Geoffrey's forgotten place in history. `No one ever mentions crown and thinks of Geoff, why is that?'

The family has been brought together for Christmas in Chinon. This is a family best left apart, with great distances between them, as the sparks fly. All of the action here takes place in the course of two days at most and in the end, nothing is really resolved here. Plots keep spinning and turning, more Byzantine than the Byzantines could ever hope to be, without any real conclusion. I guess politics never change after all.
The sets are great, realistic, filmed in castle settings in Ireland, Britain and France. Nice touches include the juxtaposition of the commonplace with the royal - unlike today's royal cocoon, there wasn't much distance between the lordly types and the regular folk. The costuming is likewise well-done, understated but entirely appropriate.
However, this is a film of dialogue, based on the play by James Goldman (who also did the screenplay). The plots and twists are non-stop, rather like a chess game conducted with real careers and acerbic, witty commentary designed both for pleasure and pain as the situation progresses. In the end, there is a merry stalemate, and Eleanor returns to her confinement, and one assumes history proceeds apace. One almost forgets this is supposed to be a Christmas gathering!
At several points in the activity, the characters confess exhaustion and faint from the efforts of continually trying to outflank each other. Yet the politics, here both national and family in character, goes on.
A fantastic film, one that holds up well with age.",1088553600,4,4401,4.875834445927904

I recently watched the Showtime Original version (Patrick Stewart & Glenn Close), and found it just as captivating.  I favor this 1968 version better; nobody out does O'Toole and Hepburn.  Peter O'Toole is seathingly into his role as Henry.  Even better is Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor (a role I consider to be tailer-made for her).  My favorite understatement in motion picture history is stated by her.  ""What family doesn't have its ups and downs.""  The scene in which this quote appears makes the statement totally true.  It is such a pity that she had to share her third Academy Award victory with Miss Diva Streisand for FUNNY GIRL.  The supporting cast are remarkably on mark.

156604,5,0792844645,"It has been many years since I first viewed this film.  I was a teenager, an English lit major and dazzled by the verbal pyrotechnics.  I still keenly recall Eleanor's evocative and erotic lines about first meeting Henry; ""He had a mind like Aristotle and a form like mortal sin...we shattered the commandments upon the spot!""  Whew!  Eleanor, both historically and fictionally was either the last of the grand pagan matriarchs, or the first truly modern woman.  The screenwriter understood she was the equal of her husband, King Henry, and their remarkable marriage/alliance was a decades long tug of war for supremacy.  It is the sunset of their lives we find them in this film.  They treat their own adult children as pawns in their ceaseless struggle for power.  Henry flaunts his young mistress, while Eleanor wields her wealth, erotic past, and influence over her eldest son.  The movie is seamless; and immensely refreshing in that a piece about Henry II doesn't focus on Beckett.  He's mentioned, of course, but only as a sidebar.  Hepburn if memory serves was actually older than O'Toole but that mere physical fact only serves to reinforce the illusion of a clash between titans.  After all, Eleanor too was older than Henry.  Of the supporting cast I can think of no weak links.  Anthony Hopkins as the sexually confused Richard the Lionheart adequately presages the remarkable career to follow. Again, I highly recommend this film.  I've often mused that if Oscar Wilde had ventured to write a historical drama the results may have been similar to The Lion In Winter.

156605,5,0792844645,"I think that most people who have seen this movie agree that it's fantastic.  Witty, wicked, wordy and visually beautiful ""The Lion In Winter"" took my breath away.  There is one thing that many people might disagree with me about.  I don't think that Henry (O'Toole) and Eleanor (Hepburn) are evenly matched.  I think that Queen Eleanor aways had the upper hand and her loving husband responded by exiling her.  I think that Queen Eleanor was smarter than her husband, he knew it & resented it.  There was a great passionate love between these two that flamed out (at least on the male side).
In her youth, Eleanor of Aquitaine was  considered the most beautiful woman in the world, and she was educated at the most sophisticated court in the world, also she was loaded.  When she married Henry, he was just a Duke, and she had been Queen of France, a bit of a letdown to say the least.
I can't help but think that Henry always resented his wife's wealth & superior station, but she loved him anyway.
Two of the saddest scenes in this movie involve Eleanor.  One is while putting on a brave face, she demands that Henry kiss young Alice in front of her.  Henry, never missing an opportuinity to hurt the Missus, gleefully obliges.  Eleanor almost crumbles before your eyes, its a very moving & powerful scene.  The other is when Eleanor is alone in her room & she picks up her looking glass and sees an old woman looking back; her silence speaks a thousand words.
O'Toole makes a wonderful Henry, selfish, cruel and ever inward turning without posessing the least amount of insight or self awareness.

Essentially, this movie is not about three men vying for the throne; it is about a marriage and its slow failure--it is a character study.  And an extremely intriguing one made most effective by the excellent acting and scathing dialogue.  It could be that the movie is a bit long, but it's extremely enjoyable nevertheless.

156607,5,0792844645,"When Katharine Hepburn utters the line ""There's going to be a Christmas Court"" you can see the wheels start grinding in her head.  She thanks Henry for letting her out of jail for the festivities.  Her children bicker and snipe at each other throughout the holiday.  Henry kisses his mistress  in front of his wife, and he can't decide which son should marry the mistress.  This is certainly not the first or last dysfunctional royal family, but it is the most witty and entertaining! Settle back and enjoy the carnage.
Verbal duals.  Manipulation.  Treason.  Rebellion.  Possible execution.  Painful memories.  An evening in the dungeon.  Just an evening of fun and games with Henry, Eleanor and the boys.  Henry, an infamous womanizer and King of England, must decide which son should inherit his crown.  He's old and tired at 50.  Eleanor prefers professional soldier Richard; Henry wants the ineffectual John.  Caught in the middle is a third son, Geoffrey who asks ""What's the nothing Geoffrey gets?""  Philip, King of France and brother to Henry's mistress Alys, arrives with an ultimatum -- the marriage of Alys to one of the Princes, or return of lands in France.
Sparks fly in several scenes between O'Toole and Hepburn as they rehash past indiscretions.  Stellar performances by newcomers Timothy Dalton and Anthony Hopkins -- it was the film debut of both actors and they couldn't have done better.  Another favorite of mine for years,  John Castle -- young, incredibly handsome, understated -- plays Geoffrey as ""all gears and wheels"" pitting one prince against the other.  Nigel Terry, later King Arthur in ""Excalibur"" is John, the young king-in-training getting a fencing lesson from his father.  You'll have to see this film to see who almost wins the crown.  And you will never see so many blue eyes darting at each other as in the dungeon scene.
Favorite lines abound -- you almost expect to hear a referee saying Point, Match Point, after each line.  The royal castle in 1183 includes chickens in the courtyard, livestock at the front door, and rough, almost monastic, fabric for the clothing.

156608,5,0792844645,"Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn are expertly cast in this deft drama of 12th century conflict within the court of Henry II of England. Hepburn plays Eleanor of Aquitaine, who meets with her husband on Christmas Eve to discuss the future of the throne. The barbed conflict between them is certainly understandable, given the fact that she has headed a rebellion against him, mothered three traitorous sons, and resents his many and highly visible mistresses.
Movies these days are plot-based, usually with lots of action to keep the short attention-spans on modern viewers on the alert, so Lion in Winter may be too slow for your average 25yo film fan. But just pour yourself a glass of zinfandel, put on your comfy slippers, sit back with the cat in your lap, and enjoy the black and wicked humor within the dialogue between these two superb performers.

  The screen writer uses words as filet knives and we get to watch the English royal family cut each other to ribbons before our eyes! It is frightening and, at times, hilarious.  The manipulation and back stabbing are stunning.
  All the actors are terrific as King Henry (Peter O'Toole) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katherine Hepburn), his normally imprisoned wife, try to determine which of their three conniving sons will sit on throne once Henry dies. I've never had so much fun watching people skewer each other with words.

156611,5,0792844645,"This is where I fell in love with the written word. More importantly, it's where I recognized that acting gave life to these words. James Goldstone's brilliant screenplay and the sharp direction of Anthony Harvey (a long time editor for Stanley Kubrick with Dr. Strangelove and Lolita to his credit)brought these characters to life for me. The film (like the original play)centers around Christmas. Henry, King of England, is being circled by his vulturous children Richard The Lion Hearted (Anthony Hopkins in his first film role), Jeffrey and John. During the holidays Henry always trots out his Queen (Katherine Hepburn) for show. They despise each other almost as much as they love one another. Queen Elenanor is pushing for the brutal Richard to be king while King Henry has been grooming his sniveling pouting son John. Everybody over looks the manipulative Jeffrey (who, ironically enough is the most like both his parents).
Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn light up and burn the screen with their powerful and withering performances. Hopkins plays Richard as a stiff, stoic individual which is perfect for the character. His best scenes include the interaction between O'Toole and Hepburn. Nigel Terry (who later starred as King Arthur in John Boorman's Excalibur)displays a spoiled and petulant character to John. Lord knows why Henry wants him to be King. Timothy Dalton (also in his first role and a long way from James Bond)brings a cat like grace to King Philip of France. He's hardly recognizable to those who know him from the Bond films.
What transpires is the Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe of the 12 century (yes, amazon says this, too but they're not the only ones to realize it). The witty, barbed dialog does occasionally crowd the little bit of action in the film but the dialog is so witty and well delivered that it doesn't matter.
Very little has been said by John Barry's uncharacteristic score. Best known for his Bond film scores, Barry delivers a musical score rich with the traditional music of the time but also oddly contemporary given the music that inspired him. It's a brilliant score that, sadly, was not recognized as such when the film was first released.
Given that Harvey got his start as film editor for Kubrick, I would have expected a film that was rich in the use of montage; instead Harvey's unobtrusive use of editing only enriches the scenes. Douglas Slocombe's cinematography demonstrates why he's the master that Spielberg and other contemporary directors have used over the years. His natural use of light and shadow enriches the drama adding an additional subtext to the project.
The DVD transfer has a fair amount of analog artifacts in the way of scratches and spots on the film this despite the fact that this is a fresh print drawn from the original negative. Still, the colors are vibrant and dance across the screen capturing your attention. The mono sound is very good although there is a considerable amount of tape hiss and other analog artifacts. That's not a problem though as the use of No Noise or one of the other digital filter systems might have robbed the music and dialog of some of its vitality.
There isn't an insert card nor is there much in the way of extras. Harvey provides an enlightening commentary on the film and the original theatrical trailer is included as well. There really didn't need to be many extras to make this film an essential addition to a DVD collection.",1069372800,17,3452,4.882453151618399
156612,5,0792844645,"What a treasure this movie is.  Based on a (then unsuccessful) play by James Goldman, The Lion in Winter has some of the best dialogue ever written for the screen  Regardless of the plot, or the historical accuracy of the piece, you just watch the film over and over, listening to the words like music.
It is a rare instance of all the right things coming together at the right time - a great script and a great cast.  This is definitely one of Katherine Hepburn's best roles even though she made it when she was quite past her prime.  Next to Lawrence of Arabia, this is Peter O'Toole's best film.  It is also Anthony Hopkins first film.  It reads as a textbook as to how a movie should be made.  They, quite simply, don't make `em like this anymore.
The plot concerns a (fictional) Christmas court held in 1183.  Henry II takes his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, out of prison to help him great the young French king Phillip.

Topping it off is the humorous and tragic figure of Eleanor (although she did bring a lot of her troubles on herself); and of course, Henry is again marvelously played by Peter O'Toole. As a medievalist, I cannot recommend this enough.

156614,5,0792844645,"UPDATED Monday June 20, 2016 for grammatical and Structural problems, originaly review from 2003:

I read the the play ""Lion in the Winter"" some time ago and I loved the political intrigue, the depth of the characters, and the constant guessing games of what the real motives behind each character was. I had wanted to see the movie for a long time and finally got my chance when it was on TCM recently.

 This movie is not for those with short attention spans. It is extremely wordy. In fact there isn't much action at all, the action is in the dialogue, and it is a study of political intrigue. The extraordinary thing about both the play and movie is how it can be both very dramatic and hysterically funny at the exact same time, this is a testament to the strength of the source material, which is immense.

 In the movie Katherine Hepburn(Who deservedly won her 3rd Academy Award here.) and Peter O'Toole  work extraordinarily well together, Peter O'Toole certainly should have won an Oscar for his performance here as well (He still hasn't won as many times as he has been nominated, but rather was given a slap to the face with an ""honerary"" oscar about 10yrs ago). O'Toole and Hepburn  have a wonderful chemistry which makes the whole film work and hold together. Without the strength of them the film would not hold together, whoever cast this film was a genius, they're interpretations the characters very sharp, precise, poignant, and witty.  As well as the supporting cast which includes a very young Anthony Hopkins, which is a delight to watch.

Absolutely one of the best films of the 1960's.

156615,5,0792844645,"Katherine Hepburn's fans have their own favorite film of hers. This is mine. It is sheer pleasure to observe not only her overall performance (for which she received one of her four Academy Awards for best actress) but also her interaction with O'Toole who obviously adores her. (Who wouldn't?) Those who have read Amy Kelly's magnificent biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine already know how much she and Hepburn share in common, notably their exceptional intelligence and determination. As Anthony Harvey directs her and as Eleanor is portrayed by James Goldman in his Academy Award-winning screenplay, Hepburn more than holds her own with estranged husband King Henry II (O'Toole) despite his almost total control of her exile from his court. What must she do to end her castle-arrest and thereby gain her freedom? Henry wants a divorce so he can marry his mistress, Princess Alais (Jane Merrow), and also regain the Aquitaine to which Eleanor has legal rights. Eleanor has no intention of allowing either when Henry permits her a brief respite to join him and their sons for Christmas. They have three: Philip (Timothy Dalton) King of Spain, Prince Richard (Anthony Hopkins), and Prince John (Nigel Terry). What we have here is a 12th century soap opera...but a royal detergent of the very highest possible quality.

Not much happens. That is, there is very little physical action in this film but the mind games,  duels of wit, conspiracies, temporary alliances, betrayals of confidence, accusations and threats, innuendoes, bluffs, sarcasm, flattery, posturing, etc. are non-stop. The script has a turbocharged literacy. Also, the film is visually stunning, especially given the fact that interior decorators in 1183 A.D. had to work within rather severe limitations. John Barry received an Academy Award (for the music score) and The Lion in Winter was also nominated for best film but lost out to (believe it or not) Oliver! What I most enjoy is the dialogue between Henry and Eleanor. The film sags a bit when they are not together on screen. The supporting cast is few in number but generally effective. However, Hepburn and O'Toole totally dominate the scenes in which they appear and their personalities dominate the scenes in which they are elsewhere.

Although I greatly appreciate the clearer image and sound of the DVD format, I am underwhelmed by the quality and number of supplementary materials which are unworthy of this great film. Presumably something will soon be done about that.",1058572800,,2500,5.122549019607843

156621,5,0792844645,"This movie shares the top spot on my personal ten best list with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Play/screenwriter James Goldman had the idea of putting the spirit and dialogue of a Tennessee Williams family-centered drama into a well known medeival setting: The household of Henry II, Plantagenet, of England, brilliantly played by Peter O'Toole, and it works unlike any other medevial period piece you've ever seen!

The Plantagenet family is as dysfunctional as anything you've seen in ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" or ""Suddenly Last Summer"", with covetous children, (""Excalibur's"" Nigel Terry, ""Blow-Up's"" John Castle and Anthony Hopkins, doing a bad Richard Burton imitation,) lusting after their parents' land and power, and a king who has inprisoned his wife, Queen Consort Eleanor of Aquataine, mother of his three sons, for ten years due to conspiratorial behavior. This role is played by the brilliant Katherine Hepburn.

This is topped off by a near familial connection with the truly Machiavellian, newly crowned king of France, Philip II, played by an unrecognizable Timothy Dalton. He plays the Plantagenets like a harp, corrupting the oldest, Richard (yes, the ""Lionhearted"",) and holding the betrothal of his sister to Richard over Henry's head like the Sword of Damocles. Through all of this, Henry and Eleanor spar with each other AND their sons over the heirs they prefer to succeed Henry, the king PLAYING like he favors the gimpish John so as to get concessions out of Eleanor and Richard, and Eleanor favoring Richard, who she has apparently turned into the ultimate momma's boy. Both of them generally ignore the vastly more presentable and level headed Geoffrey, whom Henry and Philip see as a bit of a weasel. Geoffrey makes his resentment for generally being ignored by Henry and Eleanor known throughout the movie, and you have to wonder, as the brood is protrayed by the actors here, why DID they disdain him?! Henry states HIS take on Geoffrey pretty succinctly: ""Geoffrey...! There's a masterpiece! He isn't flesh, he's a DEVICE! He's wheels and GEARS...!""

The deep, personal bollides are thrown back and forth like ninja stars in this drama, gouging each character to the bone. Henry:""I'm villifying you, for God's sake! Pay attention!!"" Eleanor:""How many spindly, ricket-ridden, milky, wizened, dim-eyed, gammy-handed, limpid line of THINGS, will you beget?"" Geoffrey: ""I know...you know I know...I KNOW you know I know. We know Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it. We're a knowledgeable family!"" Eleanor: ""Be Richard's chancellor!"" Geoffrey: ""Rot!"" Eleanor: ""Sons? We could populate a country town with country girls who bore you sons! How many are there? Let me count the bastards!"" John: ""If I should suddenly burst into flames, there isn't a living soul who woould pee on me to put the fire out!"" Richard: ""Let's strike a flint and see..."" I'm not even sure ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" was this entertaining, dysfunctionality-wise!

Geoffrey and John ally themselves with Philip and things really get heavy as they witness the most shocking scene in the movie from behind a tapestry in Philip's guest quarters. This scene may actually be the basis for the erroneous assertion that Richard the Lionhearted was gay. He probably wasn't. If he were, and considering that this was roughly taking place during the same period as the Spanish Inquisition was getting started, chances are both Philip AND Richard would have been excommunicated SOOOO fast, their heads would have spun, if not been lopped off!

O'Toole and Hepburn chew the scenery like pros, and you'll wonder why O'Toole didn't win an Oscar for best actor for what is easily his best role ever. This film revived Hepburn's career and launched those of Dalton, Hopkins and Terry. (And only won FIVE Academy Awards!)

NOWHERE will you find a more effective and entertaining movie with a medeival setting, and I defy you to come away from viewing this film without becoming a MAJOR fan of Peter O'Toole or Katherine Hepburn's prodigious acting talents!

156622,5,0792844645,"This 1968 film is packed with intense drama, conflict, intrigue and passion. It was formerly a play by James Goodman, who adapted it to the screen, with every bit of its ruthless intrigue in the court of King Henry II in 1183 intact, enhanced by some excellent cinematography depicting what life must have been like in a world where the King was all powerful.  Anthony Harvey did a masterful job of directing, and I was captivated by the way he brought this intense rendering of the power, politics and conflicting wills to the screen.
Peter O'Toole stars as the 50-year old Henry, who is in the process of selecting one of his three sons to inherit his throne.  Will it be John, his young favorite, played by Negel Terry, only sixteen years old and not very bright?  Or will it be Richard, played by a youthful Anthony Hopkins, the oldest and most despised because his mother favors him?  Or will it be Geoffrey, played by John Castle, the schemer.  This is not a simple decision, of course.  Everybody hates each other with venom rarely depicted on screen or in life.  And perhaps the most venomous of all is Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, a role that won Katherine Hepburn, then 60, an Academy Award.  There is such animosity between her and the King that she has been imprisoned in a tower for the past ten years and is only allowed out for Christmas and state occasions.
It's Christmas now and the family is gathered in one of the King's many castles.  Henry flaunts his young mistress, played by Jane Morrow, who is the sister of the King of France, played by Timothy Dalton. Everybody loathes each other and the intrigue is ruthless and constant.  This is all shown though dialogue - dialogue so well written that I found myself cringing at the cruel insults and betrayals. All we see is hatred and more hatred.  And yet, in one of her greatest roles, Katherine Hepburn's role shines. Underneath it all, there is love. I can't possibly imagine any other actress in the role.
As the film unfolded I felt I was in the presence of genius. It's a work of pure art.  Every line has meaning.  Every gesture, every glance and every action went well below the surface of the words.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, not only because of the great performances, but also because of the many twists and turns of the plot.

There are traitorous plots against him by all three sons vying for the throne, but in the end it is Henry who proves to be the most cunning and underhanded of them all.

You sometimes need a scorecard to decipher just who is plotting against whom at any given moment--alliances are fleeting among the Plantagenets--but the dialogue, delivered by a superb cast, is the real point of ""The Lion in Winter."" Nobody in the world ever really talked like this, but isn't it wonderful that characters in plays and movies do?

156629,4,0792844645,"This is an interesting take on the relationship of King Henry II of England and his wife and Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Based upon a stage play by James Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay for the film and won an Oscar for his efforts, it has the feel of theatre to it, rather than film.

Here, Henry and Eleanor are in their golden years. Henry is fifty and his wife, whom he has had imprisoned for the last ten years, is several years older. He brings her out of captivity for Christmas, and she joins him and their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey, and John.

Peter O'Toole gives a fine portrayal of the aging, but still robust and virile, Henry, who is in a seeming quandary as he debates a burning issue. To whom of his three sons shall he leave his hard won kingdom? He professes to want to leave it to his youngest, John, as that is the son whom he claims to love the most. One has to wonder, however, what kingly qualities he sees in John, played as a pimply faced, sixteen year old fool by Nigel Terry, who does what he can with this unsympathetic role.

Eleanor, however, tartly played by the always glorious Katherine Hepburn, prefers her oldest, Richard, who is the son whom she has loved the most, though he, too, has his issues. Richard is played as a blood thirsty homosexual by a somewhat wooden Anthony Hopkins in his screen debut.

No one seems to love the middle son, Geoffrey, and he knows it, though he seems to be the one son whose behavior is the most within the bounds of what one might consider acceptable, as he is neither a killer nor a fool. He is merely unloved by his parents. John Castle gives a strong performance in this role.

Eleanore manipulates each of her three sons, as if they were pawns in a game of chess, in her quest for personal power. Henry also play them like fiddles. They, in turn, seem to care little for either their mother or their father. It is no wonder that they are totally disfunctional as a family.

Also, living in the castle is the beautiful Alais, sister to the young King of France, Philip II, played by Timothy Dalton in a very credible debut performance. Betrothed to Richard fifteen years before at the age of seven, Alais has since fallen in love with Henry, and he has made her his mistress. Eleanor is fully aware of the fact, and Henry flaunts Alais with gusto. Alais, however, is eclipsed by the highly intelligent and ruthlessly clever Eleanor. Yet, it is Alais, played with warm tenderness by the lovely Jane Morrow, whom the King professes to love.

Still, one has to wonder. It seems that Henry and Eleanor have very strong feelings for each other, which are veiled by a mask of supposed hatred and disguised by the venom that they spout at each other. The dialogue between the two protagonists consists of sharp and bitter repartee, which is delivered fast and furious, reminiscent of the dialogue spewed forth in Edward Albee's play ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".

Eleanor and Henry parry back and forth the entire film, each trying to vanquish the other verbally. The two aging monarchs are aware that they are coming to terms with their own respective mortality, yet each is loath to let go of the trappings of their greatness, no matter what the cost. Hepburn and O'Toole ham it up with over the top performances, though given the excesses of the dialogue, which is often witty and full of ripostes that go for the jugular, it is as the author wished.

Here, Henry and Eleanor are in their golden years. Henry is fifty and his wife, whom he has had imprisoned for the last ten years, is several years older. He brings her out of captivity for Christmas, and she joins him and their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey, and John.
Peter O'Toole gives a fine portrayal of the aging, but still robust and virile, Henry, who is in a seeming quandary as he debates a burning issue. To whom of his three sons shall he leave his hard won kingdom? He professes to want to leave it to his youngest, John, as that is the son whom he claims to love the most. One has to wonder, however, what kingly qualities he sees in John, played as a pimply faced, sixteen year old fool by Nigel Terry, who does what he can with this unsympathetic role.
Eleanor, however, tartly played by the always glorious Katherine Hepburn, prefers her oldest, Richard, who is the son whom she has loved the most, though he, too, has his issues. Richard is played as a blood thirsty homosexual by a somewhat wooden Anthony Hopkins in his screen debut.

This movie is proof that it is the story and not the effects that make a masterpiece. The scenery and background music fit nicely into the superb story. What makes this movie is that instead of heroes and villains, we have HUMAN BEINGS WITH BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS. King Henry II, Eleanor, the eventual King Richard the Lion Hearted, Geoffrey, and the eventual King John all display actions that are reprehensible at times. But despite their faults, we are never allowed to forget that they are all human. Each character has his or her moments where we can feel deep sympathy for them. Another phenomenal aspect of this movie is that there is non stop emotional intensity with a minimal of violence. Another thing I must say is that rather than the traditional romances that all have a happy ending formula, we have a more original and memorable formula. We are seeing the aftermath of King Henry II's and Eleanor's marriage. From the content of their disputes, it is obvious that they once adored each other. The ending is original, and it offers a wonderful mixture of sorrow and humour. This movie defines emotional intensity.

156640,5,0792844645,"I'll keep it reasonably brief, since many other reviews have delved into the plot and character portrayals effectively already.
First, for the lover of all thing medieval - the cinematographic portrayal of ""real"" castle life is supurb. 1183 is a time when, as someone greater than I said, life was ""nasty, short and brutish"". The sense of this is well portrayed in the film. One will notice the general starkness of the furnishings, the drafy breezes flowing behind the tapestries, the ice in the water the King uses to wash his face, the chickens before the palace door, the dogs in the hallway, the mudddy castle courtyard. There is very little of the romantisized view of medieval life to be found here - and that is fairly rare. The cinematography plays to this, portraying the starkness without making it seem boring (which it easily could have!) The dialog also supports this well, reinforcing that the age of 50 was a rarely seen thing in those days, and that monarchs made abuse of their power and position (like adultery) a routine 'given' that was hardly even factored into consideration, despite Henry's 'passion for peace' and the joys of deciding peasant squabbles.
And although there are some minor anachranisms to be found in the film, most are there in an almost Shakesperean manner - Hepburn's 'knives' speech to her children, that ""it's 1183, ... and we're barbarians"" comes to mind - who would utter such a speech, except in an aside comment to the audience in a play from the Great Bard. The lyrical style of the excellent dialog (again, another kudos for the scriptwriter here!) also heakens back to the Immortal Bard - and yet is somehow ever more real, and relevant in it's way than Shakesperes plays themselves are.
The (for the film's publishing time) avant guarde treatment of Richard's homosexuality also hearkens back to a more realistic view of homosexuality and it's 'place' within society, as reflected by the morals of the 12th century (Although Hopkins does not play that part of his role well - one of his few failings in this film).
Finally - view this film for the acting - especially the complex portrayals of Henry and Elanor. There are more moments than I can reasonably count in this film, where the movement and facial expressions so closely match, and enhance, the dialog that the feeling of the 'reality' of these complex exchanges only grows stronger with repeated viewings of the film. Not to shortchange any of the major players here (except perhaps Hopkins, who does seem wooden and uncomfortable with the homosexuality portions of his role), Geoffery, Alaise, and even John (who'se part is unsympathetic at best, but portrayed well by Nigel) offer a level of complexity of character rarely seen in film these last 15 or 20 years. Geoffery's portrayal of the 'Middle Child Syndrome' is especially gifted in this dialog with his mother, in the 'easy answers' exchange.

That was really the magic behind this movie: watching to see who would be able to pull off the best double cross. So intelligent. Really.
Also, it was nice to see a Young Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton. Altough Dalton really talked like a girl. Maybe he was a castroti. I don't know. But I would've liked to have seen the flashback where Hopkins turns Dalton into his own personal catamite. Hmmmmm.
Well shot too. This movie could've looked very bland, but they had just enough dollies and interesting cutting and effective close ups to keep me very engaged.

156644,5,0792844645,"I once saw a comic-book version of _Hamlet_, in which the plot was still Shakespeare but the dialogue was pure Stan Lee. Towards the middle we get this exchange: Hamlet: ""What the-? There's someone listening behind the curtain! Ha ha! I'll fix them!"" [Stabs.] Polonius: ""ARRRGH! You've got me!"" Or something like that.
Shakespeare never got round to writing a _Henry II_, but if he had, the Classic Comix version might have been a little like _The Lion in Winter_. I do mean that as a high compliment. The poetry is missing, but the structure is there. In particular we have the Shakespearian habit of personalising politics, reducing affairs of state to clashes between individuals in a way that makes bad history but good drama.
The imitation of Shakespeare in James (brother of famed scriptwriter William) Goldman's script even extends as far as giving soliloquies to both Henry II and his estranged consort Eleanor of Aquitaine. These are prosey, posy and not completely successful. His imitation of Shakespeare's ruderies, on the other hand, works very well, including a vomit joke addressed (by Hepburn of all people) straight to camera, or - as Shakespeare would say - ""aside"".
The cut and thrust of Goldman's dialogue is also much more successful than the more self-conscious soliloquising. And Goldman provides no shortage of opportunities for his cast to shine: all the characters are written much larger than life, whether in grandeur or villainy: or both, in the case of O'Toole's blustering, bitter and occasionally charming Henry II and Hepburn's Eleanor of Acquitaine, a cunning, controlled strategist occasionally melting into something like warmth. Each actor gives one of the best performances of their careers: neither is ""realistic"", but both are utterly compelling.
Goldman's script, at its best, gives us some of the pathos of age, where vital people are not yet ready to relinquish power, or lust, or lust for power: at times it achieves an elegaic feel of better times lost and regretted, and a genuine pathos that I suspect Richard Lester drew on as a model for his wonderful film _Robin and Marion_, also about fighters and lovers past their prime, made some ten years later.
Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton make creditable film acting debuts as Henry's sons Most Likely to Succeed (pun intended), though the scripts gives them less to do. Dalton's portayal of the future Richard III as homosexual, and therefore weak, malicious and nasty, roots the film firmly in the late 1960s: brave enough to mention homosexuality at all, but not yet brave enough to go beyond stereotyping.
But there's nothing wrong with the film being obviously an artifact of its time. Part of the pleasure of Shakespeare is observing ancient Greeks, or Romans, or Medieval Venetians through Elizabethan English eyes. In this script we see two periods of history, the Medieval period and the ""sixties"" intersecting, one period interpreted in terms of the other. This doesn't detract from the interest of the film, as a couple of reviewers suggested, but rather adds to it.
I've reviewed script and acting because that's what this film is about: half a dozen actors gather in and around a draughty old castle and talk and chew scenery. And incidently they make history: a king is chosen, and of course if we know our Shakespeare (or our history) we know it's a bad choice.
The cast conspire, argue, fight and make up, or make love: and it's gripping to watch. Goldman's script may not have been a great play, and some earlier reviewers have identified some of the reasons why not, but the point is that it made a great film. Not all of it is deep, though some of it is, and all of it holds the attention. This is a Damn Fine Film.

156649,5,0792844645,"One of the problems endemic to movies adapted from stage plays is the annoying boxing in of the action - everything must take place in the same two or three locales.  Anthony Harvey, director of THE LION IN WINTER, manages to overcome this handicap by bringing the historical setting to a rich, credible life.  As you watch, you find yourself leaning forward in fascination, muttering, ""So *that's* what it was like.""
Still, though, a movie like this lives or dies based on the writing and the performances, and both aspects are nearly flawless.  The script has a certain '60's stridency in parts, but God knows it's infinitely better than most plays from that era.  The characters trade barbed ripostes like seasoned pros - even Anthony Hopkins' hulking Richard III is a wit - but the movie is better as catharsis than light entertainment.  The story is a sad one, not grim, but flavored with the wistful remorse of the king and his queen, who have ended up making far less out of their lives than they could have and are acutely aware of the fact.
The performances are great across the board - everyone knows who Hepburn, O'Toole, Hopkins, and Dalton are, but the lesser-known John Castle and Jane Merrow ace theirs perfectly well (both of them also turned in good performances in episodes of THE PRISONER, as did this film's briefly-seen Kenneth Griffith).  I got my friends to watch this by telling them it was THE BIG KAHUNA in the Middle Ages; it's not, of course, but the principal joy of each film is the same: the pleasure of watching a pack of wonderful actors tearing into each other with maximum gusto.
In short, this movie is a definite to-own.  The DVD's extra features are practically nonexistent, but there is an interesting and illuminating commentary by the director.  Even if there weren't, though, the superior presentation would still warrant a purchase.",994550400,3,1875,4.801242236024844

156652,2,0792844645,"One of the most frustrating movies ever made because so much talent was wasted on a script that thinks it is more clever than it actually is.  Many fine actors with a great deal of genuine presence (Hepburn, O'Toole, Hopkins, Dalton) try to utter this drivel with a sense of both irony and conviction but end up overplaying to compensate for writing that refuses to go beyond the surface gloss of it's presumed wit.  (Others reviewing this movie have commented on representative lines of dialogue that support my point.)
That said, I still bought The Lion in Winter.  The sheer grandeur of Hepburn and O'Toole both as ""actor"" and ""star"" is worth watching for its own merit. They are Eleanor & Henry by Divine Right, irrespective of the words they're forced to speak. You also get Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton showing the promise that they would fullfill later in their careers.  John Barry's score is a dazzler, even if he borrows more than a little from Orff's Carmina Burana. The settings and costumes capture what one might believe is a real feel for 12th century England & France.  This is not the kind of Middle Ages you see in a storybook, but a place subject to the physical rigors of its time.

156655,5,0792844645,"This is the type of film that reminds us of the power of acting to involve us with people we initially do not know. It also is a shocking reminder of the poverty of today's actors to make us care about those we see on the screen. The emotional detachment of most of today's American cinema (e.g., Pearl Harbor) stands in stark contrast to the violent emotionalism as exhibited in this magnificent film. John Barry's score beautifully reflects this film's multi-faceted emotional appeal. Hepburn (Eleanor) and O'Toole (Henry II), along with the Plantagenet siblings, are engaged in a fratricidal all-out war, in which evreything and anyone is fair game. Emotional warfare is as lethal a weapon as Dirty Harry's Magnum, and all the players use it to great effect. The Lion in Winter is virtuoso acting at its highest form, and the dialogue written for the entire cast is pitched high, but still undeniably effective. ""What family doesn't have its troubles?"" asks Eleanor as one titantic battle subsides and the principals mend their wounds in anticipation of the next conflict. What that question asked can be seen in film after film since then, but few films are able to demonstrate the high stakes of emotional claims as being paired with political and social stakes like this one -- maybe Godfather I and II had that depth of writing and acting, but few others. This is film-making at its finest: no glitz, relatively simple sets, authentic costumes, and the best cast you could possibly have at the time. What more could you want?

This movie, set at Christmas during the reign of Henry II (Peter O'Toole) is more historically accurate than any other middle ages period piece I have seen.  Chickens and farm animals are constantly running about the castle.  Hepburn and O'Toole's characters are shown to have flaws and problems just like any other dysfunctional family.  Each character is well acted and multi-dimensional.  This was Anthony Hopkins', who plays Richard, first movie.  If the DVD retains any of the extras from the 25th Anniversary laserdisc, there should be a good interview with Hopkins about acting with Hepburn.

The characters scheme and backstab, hurt each other and themselves, and all but self-destruct. Peter O'Toole (Henry II) is marvelous as he growls and howls his way through his family's treachery. Katherine Hepburn is both malicious and pitiful as the free-for-the-holiday imprisoned Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Their sons are jealous, revengful and petty-- just like their parents.
While this sounds like an episode of ""Melrose Place,"" it's not. Intelligent philosophising, witty dialogue, and a mouth-breathing son or two separate ""Lion"" from the trash heap.",983664000,,728,5.2844827586206895

It has all the earmarks of  ""serious""  Sixties Broadway drama:  black humor a la Albee; Freudian undercurrents; the broaching of homosexuality; yelling; talking; poorly written monologues  (Hepburn's  ""mirror""  soliloquy is ghastly, not to mention self-exploitative); the knocking-kneed exploration of the new Sexual Freedom; shouting; expounding; and . . . talking.  Talk talk talk.  There is so much talk that the plot gets buried under it -- you have to see this one a couple times before you fully grasp all the Byzantine schemes hatched by Henry, Eleanor, and their fractious sons.  One gets the feeling that  *The Lion In Winter*  should be staged as a comedy, but here it's played deadly serious.  I already mentioned Hepburn's egregious  ""mirror""  scene.  No one else fares much better.  Peter O'Toole has the best of it, but still can't quite escape the cheesy dialogue:  ""What shall we hang?  the holly, or each other?"", not to mention  ""The sky is pocked with stars.""

God knows these immensely gifted people were flawed, but they built and destroyed, hated and loved and lived with a fiery passion that would consume most of us.

156661,5,0792844645,"This sharply portrayed and picturesque film is no less than a stunning masterpiece!  Finely capturing the gusting momentum of a kingdom and its contending rule, all the while bootying the intricacies of family passion & strife, this movie grasps all by masterfully portraying it within the frame of a Christmas holiday spent at the beauteous castle of Chinon.
The year is 1183, and Henry II, insatiate King of the British Empire summons forth his family:  his wife - Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their surviving sons Richard, Geoffery, and John.  They meet at Chinon - and like every gathering of this family must always have been, this meeting is momentous ~
James Goldman wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar he won for this screenplay -- for, not only is it in tune to every orchestral note of this history, but it is also precise as a dagger in its eloquence ~~ I've rarely heard a more masterful script portrayed on film!
Such a prodigious screenplay must needs have a brilliant cast and musical score to give it flesh and blood -- and herein you'll find it most heartily delivered!  Katharine Hepburn is absolutely stellar in her portrayal of perhaps one of the most fascinating women in history:  the much-acknowledged ""Queen of Love"" throughout Europe before she became Queen of France, fighting in the Crusades alongside her husband Louis VII of France - and then Queen of England, wife of Henry II, who had imprisoned her for many years for joining her sons in plots against him.  Henry would free her at times for such holiday family gatherings as this.
Hepburn's scenes with Peter O'Toole, as Henry, are pure electrically-charged art!  As King and Queen, parents to the three aspired heirs to the throne, they lay blame and conspire against each other, and their sons will stop at nothing to acquire what they each feel that they deserve:  succession to the throne.  To add to this tangled web of deceit are the young King Phillip of France and his sister, Alice, who had been raised in the household of King Henry, betrothed to Richard since her infancy.  While Eleanor and her sons each plot with the French King, Henry openly exhibits his ongoing love affair with Alice~~
The chemistry of this well-casted drama is flawless - every line spoken a masterpiece of wit and daring.  This movie is a rare find, indeed!",969408000,21,2327,4.807017543859649
156662,5,0792844645,". . .  especially when that family belongs to the first Plantagenet king,  the most powerful in  Europe.  Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Henry II is  clearly his finest role.  Beset by a conniving  wife [don't be fooled by  her quietly stitching away at Salisbury; she used every method of  communication available hatching plots to destroy her husband!], three sons  who spent as  much time raising rebellions as residing at court, and the  overweening power of the Papacy,  he ruled the greatest empire in Europe.  O'Toole shows incredible talent in expressing  resistance to these  astonishing pressures, secure only in faith that his abilities would  overcome them all.  His weakness, as with so many men of power, was in  dealing with  women.  He married the finest catch in Europe, but succumbed  to a succession of women, of  whom only Alais provided a devoted  innocence.
'Whatever shall we do with Mummy?' grants Eleanor the role of  Henry's foil over his three  sons.  The femiNazies rightfully rejoice in  Katherine Hepburn's office of the conspiratorial  wife.  Her Duchy of  Aquitaine was one of Europe's richest and Hepburn is wonderful in  using  that inheritance in striving for dominance over the English king.  The  scope of her  machinations is missing in the story, but Hepburn's strength  in dialog with Henry and among  her sons is classic.
The criticisms of  Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton on these pages is astonishing.  While  Richard's homosexuality has been in no way proven, the pair provide  stunning performances  of two men caught up in the complex plotting of  Medieval kings.  They ably demonstrate the  depths to which such people  stooped in gaining power.  Philip, heir to a truncated France  surrounded  by the Plantagenet empire, strives to restore his nation.  To debase  himself so  deeply to degrade Richard's position, and hence, Henry's, is  superbly drawn.  Dalton is to be  congratulated.  Hopkins shows here why  he's become one of film's leading lights, having  been lured away from the  English stage for this role.
Put this film between 'A Man for All  Seasons' and 'Becket'.  Then ask yourself why your  neighbours turn out in  such mobs to honour hereditary monarchs.",968371200,7,2220,5.076056338028169

It's Christmas 1183 and King Henry II, portrayed  magnificently by Peter O'Toole, must decide who will succeed him as heir to  the throne of England.  Always engaging and epic in scope, in two plus  hours watch as a family in love and at war with each other completely  unravels itself.

Set in a violent, unstable time of frequent wars and unrelenting political machinations, ""The Lion In Winter"" captures a vivid 12th Century  reality.  A story set in the latter part of the reign of England's Henry II  (Peter O'Toole), it explores the convoluted dynamics of royal family  politics and medieval intrigue.  Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn),  Henry's Queen, is  released from her confinement in an English castle to  join Henry at the Christmas court in France (at this time, Henry ruled  large parts of modern France as well as England).  Eleanor was confined due  to her support of Henry's sons in their uprising against him.  Henry does  not want a reoccurence.  Their sons included Richard, the Lion-Hearted  (Anthony Hopkins) and the Magna Carta's King John, who are also at the  Christmas court.  A truly amazing cast of characters are propelled by  magnificent performances and just about the best written dialogue ever put  on film.  Miss Hepburn's Eleanor won her an Academy Award for best actress.  A terrific accompaniment to the movie is Alison Weir's recent book  ""Eleanor Of Aquitaine"".  Eleanor was the wife of two kings, the  mother of three kings, the great-grandmother of two saints and lived  through two Crusades.  A fascinating woman, she lived into her 80s,  outliving eight of her ten children.

Henry II take a bow. For Henry II is the Lion in his  old age surrounded by scheming relatives not least his witty wife.  Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine turns her love and marriage with  Henry II, Peter O'Toole, into the verbal equivalent of a sword fight. Henry  II being more of a man than his namesake and distant relative Henry VIII  doesn't have her killed, rather he locks her up. Not you understand because  he doesn't like her, but because she tried to overthrow him in a rebellion.  Sparks fly when these two meet.
""Eleanor: What would you have me  do? Give out? Give up? Give in? Henry: Give me a little peace. Eleanor: A  little? Why so modest? How about eternal peace? Now there's a  thought.""
Theres a fine supporting cast of then theatrical players  now some well known faces of the movies. Theres Sir Anthony Hopkins as  Richard,
 ""I am a poet, a warrior and I will be king""
  ,though his dad thinks him not so straight, for Richard though has a  defense,
 ""So! The royal corkscrew finds ME twisted?"".
And  all this before dysfunctional had entered public vocabulary. Next is  Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, played by John Castle, a strategist and willing  player of the game.
Prince Geoffrey: ""I know. You know I know. I  know you know I know. We know Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it.  [smiles] We're a knowledgeable family.""
Youngest of the brothers is  John Lackland, Nigel Terry of Excalibur fame.
""John: Poor John. Who  says poor John? Don't everybody sob at once! My God, if I went up in flames  there's not a living soul who'd pee on me to put the fire out! Richard:  Let's strike a flint and see.""

156673,5,0792844645,"Yes, this movie is a period piece.  But this movie, adapted from a wonderful play,is at the end of the day a powerful tale of an acutely dysfunctional family.  Set during the Christmas season in 12th century  England, this story is powerfully scripted and superbly acted by everyone.  Peter O'Toole gives his tour de force performance as Henry II, a  world-weary monarch intent on maintaining supremacy and establishing his  legacy.  Katherine Hepburn, in what is the among the finest movie  performances I have ever seen, plays his deadly foil (and oh yes, estranged  wife) Queen Eleanor of Acquitaine, who is determined to thwart his plans.  The issue:  which of their surviving children will inherit the throne of  England, and marry Alais, the sister of the King of France?  The pawns in  this game are Alais and the English Princes, Richard the Lionhearted  (Anthony Hopkins), John (Nigel Terry of Excalibur fame), and Geoffrey.  Then of course, there is the wild card, the teenage French monarch, Philip  (Timothy Dalton).
In this movie you have all of the themes of familial  dysfunction:  the vitriol and wistfulness of an estranged couple, the  frustrations of the ""model"" eldest child, the resentment of the  neglected middle child, the eccentricities of the overindulged youngest  child, a May-December affair  triggered by a mid-life crisis, holiday  depression, and it goes on and on.  This movie is so adept at exploring  these topics that it makes ""American Beauty"" (a good film in its  own right) seem almost sophomoric.
What makes this movie stand out is the  writing.  There is no other movie this side of ""The Godfather""  that has contained such enjoyable dialogue and character development.

Pity  they don't make em like this anymore.",935193600,2,775,4.818181818181818
156680,5,0792844645,"As a Hepburn/O'Toole fan from way back and an English history nut to boot, this movie has everything. The gritty sets and costumes make you feel like you are in 12th-century England and the acting is superb from beginning to  end. The verbal battles make you wince and the chemistry between O'Toole  and Hepburn is real--when they are fighting you believe it and during the  rare moments of affection, you believe that too. Eleanor and Henry II are  two amazing characters and, after seeing this movie, you feel like you know  them. It deserved to win the Oscars it did. And if you like this, you'll  love Becket with Burton and O'Toole. Fine performances all around.",922406400,2,667,4.706896551724138
156681,5,0792844645,"For anyone who cannot understand how Hepburn has managed to gather a horde of admirers who would willingly give her detractors a severe lynching, this is the place to start. She pulls out all the stops to deliver one zinger  after another and is compulsively watchable. The rest of the cast tries  hard to keep up with her and hold their own during the movie. Arguably, the  movie and Hepburn take themselves a little too seriously. The dialogue is  ludicrous, but they try to play it up and even when they try to remain true  to their 'characters', the pure camp in the script shines through, rescuing  what could have been a real bore.
If you feel you don't know where the  movie is going for the first half hour, stick with it till Hepburn leaves  her prison and you'll be in for a treat. Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton  pepper the rest of the cast that tries hard to not get blown off into the  tapestries by Hepburn's incredible scene-stealing. This time, you cheer her  on, ignoring the fact that she really isn't acting (or is it 'being taken  in by it'?). She's simply perfecting the persona that made her into an icon  in the sixties. With this film, she became the only woman to win a Best  Actress Oscar back-to-back, the only woman to win three (at that time)  Academy Awards, and her public image made the final transition from 'that  annoying eccentric' to 'the woman of the century'.",917049600,,1402,4.52589641434263

7792571,5,0792844645,"One of the most well-written films I've ever seen.  The Blu-Ray video quality is superb here, and despite the intentionally subdued color palette and candle-lighting of the interior photography, the color is well-saturated with clean whites and blacks, as well as consistent grain.  The sound is excellent; dialogue and music are clear and crisp.  This classic film has been lovingly restored, and the results are very pleasing, indeed.  This is a no-risk buy for a high definition transfer that is quite nicely done.",1524182400,,517,5.192771084337349
