8175626,5,B000N8V49K,We have traveled using the Empire Builder several times and this video brings back many memories from our trips. Will probably purchase the video so it can be looked at in the future.,1397088000,,183,4.575757575757576
8175627,5,B000N8V49K,This video is an excellent chronicle of the Empire Builder Amtrak long distance rail line which was operated by the freight railroads before Amtrak came into existance and took over USA passenger rail routes.,1367020800,,208,5.147058823529412
8175628,1,B000N8V49K,"I like to travel on trains but unfortunately all the dvds in this genre are pretty boring, not enough scenery and very outdated.  I will not watch anymore dvds in this series.",1362960000,,175,4.46875
8175629,5,B000N8V49K,"This video is wonderful if you will be traveling on the Empire Builder. I am an avid train fan and this is one of my favorite videos about the Empire Builder. If you like this one, check out Extreme Trains: The Overnight Traveler. The video quality is very good for being filmed so long ago.",1361491200,,291,4.3090909090909095
8175630,3,B000N8V49K,"This was produced by a TV station in Spokane, WA. It presents a good overview of a trip on the Empire Builder from Chicago to Seattle.  Good photography. Good information. A bit pricy at $35.

Another option is available here at Amazon. Search for ""The Emprie Builder"". That runs about $17 and follows the trip from Seattle to Chicago with more info on the city of Seattle. Both videos are pretty good. Both videos present interesting, factual information about the trip and vaious towns and areas the train passes through.",1301184000,3,523,4.8
