8122501,5,B000FH6LUG,"I have purchased several workout DVD's and this one is the best. It's really for beginners. It has 5 different workouts and if you fall behind or miss the step, you can just march until you catch up. I'm over 50 and out of shape. It does get to moving pretty fast on the aerobics workouts, but that is ""cardio"". If you order this DVD, just keep at it and as you learn the routines you will be able to follow easily.",1317513600,5,415,4.073170731707317
8122502,2,B000FH6LUG,"This could be a good exercise video, but she does not give you time to learn a move before she is on to the next one. Very hard to follow along.",1316563200,,144,3.6774193548387095
8122503,5,B000FH6LUG,"As a WW lifetime member, I first bought this dvd 2 years ago.  I enjoyed it so much that I recommended it to a friend, let her borrow it, and never got it back!  I ordered it again recently using Amazon and have fallen in love with it all over again.  It's great because there are several different types of workouts at shorter intervals.  For days when I can only squeeze in 20 minutes, this is perfect.  I almost always add in the 10 minute ab workout because you just can't go wrong with that :-)  The instructor is cute, energetic, and she has a bit of a British accent.  It's very motivating!",1305849600,,597,4.230088495575221
8122504,4,B000FH6LUG,"This dvd is fantastic, it has a lot of variety so you can pick and choose what you want to do on any given day. I would have liked to have seen a little more intense workout for the abs but the dance routine is very fun!",1285286400,,220,3.702127659574468
8122505,5,B000FH6LUG,"I have had 3 spine surgeries on my neck, and have 4 donor bones with a double, and single titanium plate with screws, and cages in my neck, and even I can do these workouts!  I am so excited that I found something that is so fun, and still doable for me.  You can do it at your own pace.  It has 5 different workouts that you can alternate during the week, so you won't get bored.  There is a dance cardio that is really fun, and the Pilates/Yoga is amazing.  The Fat Burning Basics workout is simple, but very effective. The Toning, and Abs in 10 minute workouts are equally amazing!  I have previously bought other workout DVD's with Petra Kolber as the instructor, and I just love her.  Petra has high energy, and is really fun.  I highly recommend buying this DVD if you are just starting out or if you can only do low impact aerobics.",1257897600,11,839,4.232704402515723
8122506,5,B000FH6LUG,"There are five workouts on this DVD, and you can mix and match them according to what you feel up to doing that day:  (1) Fat Burning Basics - 20 minutes of basic fat burning cardio; (2) Cardio Dance - 20 minutes of easy dance steps; (3) Toning - 20 minutes of toning your upper and lower body using hand weights; (4) Pilates/Yoga - 20 minutes of stretching and toning using your own body weight; and (5) Abs - 10 minutes of solid core conditioning.  Petra Kolber is a fun and engaging instructor!  I usually do three of these workouts at a time for a great one-hour workout; but I could easily do two or just one of the 20-minute workouts if I was either pressed for time or just didn't have much energy.  Great for beginners and intermediates!",1244419200,6,745,4.338129496402877
8122507,3,B000FH6LUG,"The product itself is good.  The instructor is easy to follow along.  If you are an intermediate or above exerciser then this video will be way too low of an intensity for you, overall good product.",1242172800,3,198,4.472222222222222
8122508,4,B000FH6LUG,You should not pay more than $15 for this dvd.  It should be sold only at weight watchers meetings since the staff that works the meetings gets comission on the product sales.  (This is the way the staff get paid to work the meetings!!!!),1196294400,4,238,4.386363636363637
8122509,5,B000FH6LUG,"I have a collection of at least 50 exercise videos.  This set from Weight Watchers is the one I keep going back to.  There are three videos in the series; Get Moving is the second.  Each one is at a different level of intensity.  By working your way through each video in turn, you can easily develop the skills and fitness level necessary for moving on to the next tape in the series.

These tapes are very well cued.  The moves and choreography are easy to follow, without being boring.  Nancy is an excellent instructor.

The three VHS tapes were released as one DVD, but it's difficult to find in either format.",1176681600,,615,4.428571428571429
8122510,5,B000FH6LUG,"It is a great 3 different level workout.  Gets you going, no matter what time of the day it is.  You get good cardio and good weight lighting also.",1170028800,,147,4.0344827586206895
