Those sketch comedy-style features from the '70s like ""The Groove Tube"" and ""Can I Do It Till I Need Glasses?"", with the only real difference being that this video is, well, shot on video and features what are, arguably, a hotter caliber of sexy women, including Playboy Playmates Pamela Jean Bryant (April 1978), Ava Fabian (August 1986), Carol Ficatier (December 1985), Sondra Greenberg (June 1987), Susie Owens (March 1988) and Teri Weigel (April 1986), plus Roxane Kernohan (""Critters II"") and Lisa London (""H.O.T.S."").
