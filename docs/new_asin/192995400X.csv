7801323,1,192995400X,"I have many videos that pertain to Route 66.  This video is the least imaginative, most poorly edited one I have purchased.  The participants in the drive did not ""Drive 66"" but drove on I-55 and exited to Route 66 to see specific sites.  They even managed to include a motorcycle shop commercial along the way.  In my opinion, poorly produced.",1138579200,,344,4.590163934426229
7801324,1,192995400X,"This video is not a documentary of Route 66 in New Mexico.  Instead, it is a travel video that covers the producer's trip through New Mexico.  It misses entirely the old and historic section of Route 66 through Santa Fe.  It ignores and does not cover the excellent portion of Route 66 going from Grants to the Arizona border (including all of Route 66 in colorful Gallup).  It does show some nice shots of the Albuquerque balloon festival, along with a nice view of the City of Albuquerque from Sandia.  I rate this video one star as a documentary of Route 66 in New Mexico and perhaps two stars if you're looking for a travel documentary.  If you're looking for a motercycle travel documentary, then you might even give it three to four stars.  However, don't expect to get an accurate or complete overview of Route 66 in New Mexico.",1060473600,,835,4.526666666666666
7801325,5,192995400X,"Although I haven't seen this video, I have done something better... I have traveled the longest stretch between Seligman, Az. and Kingman, through Oatman, and into Golden Shores. I go on the Rt. 66 Fun Run every year, and it just gets better every time. I am going to purchase the video, and I would encourage anyone interested in ""The Mother Road"" to do so also, but go out and drive it as well, you won't be sorry. If you want to see hundreds of old cars from the early 1900's, to the 70's muscle cars, as well as brand new vehicles, this is the place to be. It is usually the 1st weekend in May every year, and it starts in Seligman, on a Saturday, and ends in Golden Shores on Sunday, the 2nd day. Be there, or be square.",984009600,2,725,4.148936170212766
7801326,4,192995400X,"Kirk Woodward's video of his tour of the Arizona portion of Route 66, as well as side trips to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, is interesting and informative for those of us who love The Mother Road.  He presents the  history of Route 66 and many of the attractions and wonderful scenery found  in northern Arizona.  This is great viewing for people who want to see some  of what Arizona has to offer as well as for the fans of Route 66.",954979200,3,437,4.216867469879518
7801327,5,192995400X,"Once again, veteran videographer Kirk Woodward has scored a hit with ""Riding Route 66, New Mexico."" Beginning--where else--but in the fascinating ghost town of Glen Rio, Texas (or New Mexico, depending on  which end of town you are standing in), we move across the land of mesas at  a comfortable, measured pace. Aside from the beautiful scenery (including a  great moving shot of a locomotive) and carefully selected points of  interest, we get to poke our noses into some corners that might otherwise  go unnoticed. But the real highlight is joining Kirk ringside for the  annual Albuquerque Balloon Festival. His coverage of this dazzling (and  dizzying) event is as close as you can get to being there. As with his  other videos, you don't have to be a motorcyclist to get your kicks with  ""Riding Route 66, New Mexico."" Buy it, experience it, then tell  your friends about it.",954547200,3,881,4.852348993288591
7801328,5,192995400X,"Having seen all of Kirk Woodward's video treatments of Router 66, I'm delighted to report his segment on New Mexico is a 5-star plus.  Up to his usual standards of perfection.  His intimate knowledge of this historic  road uncovers many landmarks one would unlikely find on their own.  Experiencing the video can only enhance the spirits of exploring 66 as it  should be explored. A definite ""must"" for any video library.  Not  just a motorcycle documentary, but an experience any ""arm chair""  traveler would enjoy.",953942400,,515,4.976470588235294
7801329,5,192995400X,"You don't have to live in Illinois or own a motorcycle to enjoy this video. It's real value lies in the down home interviews, the carefully selected sites visited, and ""up-close"" road shots that put the  viewer right on the bike for a smooth cruise across the Land of Lincoln. No  stranger to Route 66, motorcycles, or videography, Kirk Woodward is a  veteran roadie and producer of a whole series of Mother Road motorcyling  documentaries. You simply cannot go wrong with ""Riding Route  66--Illinois."" Buy it today!",948067200,,516,4.885057471264368
7801330,4,192995400X,"While technically a motorcycle video of a portion of Route 66, Kirk presents scenery and information useful to anyone planning on traveling through Illinois, whether on Motorcycle or Automobile.
  Many motorcycle  touring videos are mostly a ""Gee, look at me ride and the scenery go  by.""
  Not this one.  I have viewed others in this series and found  them useful and interesting travel videos too, with enough history of Route  66 thrown in to make it a memorable educational ride.",941932800,4,483,4.9375
