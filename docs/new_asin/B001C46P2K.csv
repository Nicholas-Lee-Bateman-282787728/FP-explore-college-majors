3503986,4,B001C46P2K,"Well, I came to this one rather dreading it.  National critics had given it something of a bashing.  But it is super!

Young Victoria was the only surviving issue of several sons of George III (""Farmer George"").  Two of her uncles, George IV (who made Brighton Pavilion) and his brother William IV (known as the ""Sailor King"" and ""Silly Billy""), preceded her as monarch.  Unfortunately for Victoria, her father, the Duke of Kent, died very early and her mother, the Duchess, fell under the spell of - not to put too fine a point on it - a conman in the shape of (later knighted as ""Sir"") John Conroy.  Sensing the prospect of power, the two of them raised poor Victoria in a repressive background at Kensington Palace, dubbing their tyrannical regime ""The Kensington System.""

This is where the film starts.  I loved it.  Victoria is played with emotional literacy and verve by Emily Blunt.  Miranda Richardson is restrained and blinkered as the Duchess and Mark Strong makes a villainous Conroy, slapping Victoria as she refuses to sign a document making him Regent.

Several of the other actors are so good that their identity in the cast list came as a PLEASANT SURPRISE (hence the title of this review).  Jim Broadbent is great as crusty old William IV, asking God to let him hang on until May, when Victoria comes of age.  (Thankfully, she did - and banished Conroy from her Court on her accession.)  Michael Maloney puts in good work as Sir Robert Peel who Victoria clashes with politically.  Paul Bettany is fabulous, if somewhat too young, as Lord Melbourne, Victoria's adviser and crush.

But the honours go to the dashing Rupert Friend, wonderful as Prince Albert.  Albert - German and Royal and not popular with Parliament - is utterly rehabilitated in this film.  It's a beautiful love story in a historical setting.  The romance is made all the more poignant by the knowledge that Albert died after he and Victoria had ruled for 20 years.  She mourned him for the rest of her life.  On the morning afer their wedding night, he lies motionless in bed, almost a precursor of his death, as she passionately surveys him.

The loveliness of romance is underpinned by solid history and politics.  The production values are superb, the research admirable, the storytelling gripping.

So what if it's revisionist in some respects?  I won't be pedantic.  But if you see it and like it, carry on to Christopher Hibbert's superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Victoria-A-Personal-History/dp/0006388434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen Victoria: A Personal History</a>&nbsp;and the somewhat less marvellous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Queen/dp/0099451824/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Queen</a>&nbsp;(a bit novelettish for me).

3503987,4,B001C46P2K,"I recently got to see this film on an airplane as I was flying back to the US from England, rather ironically. I thought I'd enjoy another look at some of the English locations I had fallen in love with so recently, and it worked lke a charm. Stunning cinematography

Emily Blunt was superb as a young Queen Victoria. I know to the history buffs, the historical accuracy is not to be found, but truthfully isn't everything conjecture? To get reality, you'd have to have been there.

I found it delightful to watch, and it is has further urged me to do more research on Victoria and Albert myself. I found this fresh take on their relationship compelling, and any film that makes me want to dig my heels in and do some reading, gets a positive vote from me.

Well done.",1244073600,80,768,4.394366197183099
3503988,4,B001C46P2K,"Starring Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada, Charlie Wilson's War) and Rupert Friend (Pride & Prejudice, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) ""The Young Victoria"" is a whimsical, romanticized look at the troublesome first years of the reign of Britain's longest-serving monarch, and her much-lauded marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Now, let me begin this review by asking all those of you baying for historical accuracy! Historical accuracy! Historical accuracy! - to please look elsewhere: from the second this movie kicks off it's very clear that this isn't going to be a painstakingly documented, realistically-imagined exercise in statecraft and royal alliance - ""The Young Victoria"" is a romantic drama, and I mean romantic in the most literal sense of the word.

Performances are all top-notch, with Emily Blunt's excellent reading of Victoria as a self-possessed, confident heroine being the standout best. Friend's portrayal of Albert as a lovelorn young man confined by duty and advisors is also great, and (thank heavens!) his accent is reasonable. Together the pair have real onscreen chemistry, and this provides the meat and potatoes of the movie - the restrained and forced nature of their relationship giving way to something real and passionate is finely drawn and satisfying, and a rarity given the recent spate of so-so Royal adaptations (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Duchess).

The sub-plots involving Victoria's weak mother and manipulative pseudo-stepfather (an excellent pairing of Miranda Richardson with Mark Strong) and Victoria's initial, ill-advised alliance with ex-Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) provide narrative fodder and a break from the central relationship of the movie - all give solid performances, all are well-scripted characters, and the inclusion of these elements is welcome, as opposed to distracting.

Cinematography and direction are superlative, and this is one area where ""The Young Victoria"" really shines. A gorgeous movie, this needs to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate the lush colors, textures and brilliant vistas of director Jean-Marc Valle's work. Ilan Eshkeri's score is a perfect match: stirring, rich and elegant, it's beautifully used and beautifully executed.

So what's wrong with ""The Young Victoria""? It ends rather abruptly - I found the events of the final fifteen minutes of the movie deserving of more than the screenplay gives them - and, like I said before, this isn't a terribly realistic film - I am sure that Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha did more to win such a politically advantageous bride than simply lounge around in German palaces sighing attractively. While the artistic license taken with the facts of history suits this picture, with talent like Blunt and Friend on offer, I feel the screenplay could have added more layers to their characters.

But this isn't a major complaint, and, happily, I can recommend  ""The Young Victoria"" to all, for what it is: a straightforward romantic movie. But it's a particularly well-made romantic movie, with an excellent cast, beautiful audio-visuals, and overall is a real treat.",1239408000,16,3147,5.332661290322581
3503989,4,B001C46P2K,"The film takes a look at the year leading up to and first few years of Victoria on the throne of England. It shows the struggles, trials and tribulations of being a lonely child growing up under strict rule to being a young queen on the English throne, a queen that would have the longest standing reign in all of British history.  The film also takes us into the life of a married monarch.  A true love story for the ages, the marriage between Victoria, played by Emily Blunt, and Albert, played by Rupert Friend, was arranged prior to their eventual meeting. Their official meeting was scripted, but it was when both dropped the script and began to speak as themselves that the historic romance blossomed.  The film is a wonderful depiction of the early life of the queen, showing how she became one of the greatest monarchs in British history.

  Although I am not technically trained as an historian, I am as an actor and director and I found this movie worth its price at the theatre.  Being one of many costume dramas that I have seen The Young Victoria has been by far most sound in design, screen capture, performance, and set. One must remember, though, that this is just a movie and in order for it to be completely historically accurate is reaching for the stars. This film was an interpretation above all; an inside look at the life of a young queen from an unfamiliar angle, her personal life. Though this is not the first film to do so, it is one of a few films that actually shows the passionate, loving and sexually driven young queen; not the prudish, ""we are not amused"" old queen we've grown to know.  My rating for this film stands at a strong four star, and it is recommended that if you are able to let go of the idea of being historically accurate and allow yourself to enter the imagination of film makers you will enjoy The Young Victoria.",1238284800,257,1864,4.461764705882353

I only viewed the film recently, and was not as familiar with the early history of Queen Victoria's life and reign as I might have been otherwise.

I would agree with other reviewers that Emily Blunt makes an excellent young (and beautiful) Victoria, and that Rupert Friend plays the part of Albert to perfection.

Albert, having been raised and tutored to seek the hand of his first cousin Victoria in marriage. Reportedly his paternal grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, in 1821 referred to Albert as the pendant to the pretty cousin, meaning Victoria. And his and Victoria's) Uncle Leopold, crowned King of the Belgians in 1831, also by 1836 voiced his ardent approval for the idea.

But if King Leopold wanted the marriage so that he could control the British throne through his nephew Albert, Prince Albert proved himself just as obstinate in his own way as his Queen. According to this portrayal, he would not  allow himself to be bullied, by either his wife or their Belgian uncle.

Evidently this film has done a good job of more or less accurately capturing a much longer span of history than one might expect in a 2 hour film.

The struggles over the efforts to establish a regency before Victoria was crowned are quite poignantly adapted, and the film is full of touching and humorous moments as well.

This is a gorgeous and wonderfully enjoyable film.",1517184000,,1589,4.773722627737226

Engaging performances by Emily Blunt (as Victoria) and Rupert Friend (as Albert) make this 2-hour movie enjoyable.
Will Victoria's scheming relatives prevent her from taking her rightful place as Queen? Can her German cousin Albert be persuaded to marry her?

In this version, Albert is rather dashing. And the movie concentrates on the royal couple and their fledgling romance.
The movie also includes great scenery, beautiful costumes, and a happy ""ending"" for these early years in the relationship between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

(This is a big contrast to the 2016 TV series, which wastes too much screentime on minor characters, including a maid, and the cook.) (See my previous review.)

The story, the clothes, and Buckingham Palace were all great.  My problem with the movie - stop lying about historical events because you think it will make the movie more interesting.  What are you thinking?  The truth is interesting - that's why we're watching (duh).  So, when you take a significant historical event and lie about it's outcome, you completely discredit yourself and the movie (and you anger the audience into the bargain - is that really what you want?).

3504248,5,B001C46P2K,"PLOT: Queen Victoria takes the crown and deals with her pushy mother, finds love with Albert and changes history.

Alexandrina Victoria is niece to the King.....she is the heir to the throne. Her overly controlling mother and her ""secretary"" have at times been abusive. Victoria at age 18 inherits the crown and becomes close to the Prime Minister who not only becomes her friend but mentor. The strain of so young a person from a shelter life is very hard. But she finds companionship and love with her cousin Prince Albert. Albert is played as a passionate young man but who has to wait because in this society and time Victoria makes the proposal. The Wedding is gorgeous and soon a child is born. But Victoria soon is very influenced by Albert who is German but gains her complete love and trust. Emily Blunt is very good as the Queen who ditches her mother and the hated secretary. Written by Julian Fellows (DOWNTON ABBEY)....I give it 5 STARS~",1478476800,,950,4.654761904761905

The movie doesn't cover it, of course, but the two of them, and their eventual plan to marry their progeny to royalty all over Europe (apparently to unite the countries), also helped lead to WWI.  The films, with fine performances, period sets and writing, shows a young couple in love (no one knows, perhaps, whether Albert felt as deeply, but Victoria's feelings are historically documented).  The films appears to take a little liberty with history for dramatic effect, but it is highly enjoyable.",1470787200,,576,5.042105263157895

3504304,5,B001C46P2K,"Oh so romantic, royalty, lush furnishings and costumes.....oh yeah and some villains trying to keep a good girl down they have underestimated plus the Victorian period mixed in equal drama and,romance. I'm a sucker for a good period piece and lush production values with the added bonus it's a true story (not one of those ""inspired by true events"" which are hardly true).  In spite of being born into royalty, with it's riches and privilege, the story of Young Victoria is not the fairy-tale one thinks of with a real live princess. A charming and loving prince is part of the tale that for awhile looks like a royal happily ever after.  Well acted and beautiful production values make this a worthwhile way to spend some time brushing up on some history.",1469232000,,756,4.71969696969697

I was surprised to see that much ""artistic license"" taken with Sarah Ferguson as one of the producers considering her close relationship with the monarchy. For shame. It is still worth watching, after all it isn't a historical documentary. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy. The costumes are beautiful, the scenery breathtaking and the music... I only wish I could find a reasonably priced soundtrack.",1469145600,5,521,4.865168539325842

It's a peek into the life of Victoria as she transitions from an overprotected teen to the throne of England and also chronicles her relationship with Prince Albert.  Their union was truly a love match, a rarity among arranged royal marriages, and the story of their courtship is sweet indeed. The film also provides a look into the politics of the time and all the planning and plotting of the royal court. All in all, a very enjoyable watch.",1468713600,6,535,4.448979591836735

3504418,3,B001C46P2K,"Period dramas, especially if they are based on historical fact are one of my favorite genres. And I admit wanting to see Rupert Friend in something other than Homeland. I thought this was pretty good and helped me understand Victoria a little better, but I found it a little flat. Not sure why Albert was so attracted to her. Nice to see a German portrayed as a good guy for a change. And nice to see Victoria as a young woman in love instead of an old battle ax.",1454544000,,463,4.213483146067416

3504425,4,B001C46P2K,"This is a beautiful movie, visually exquisite. Furthermore, it is well written and, for the most part historically accurate. All of that would hardly matter if the performances weren't of equal quality, which they, undoubtedly are. Even the smaller roles are cast from strength, most notably Jim Broadbent as King William IV. My one, slight caveat about the casting, which has been noted by another reviewer, is Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne. His acting is fine, but he definitely is too young for the part, as Melbourne would have been about fifty-eight at the time of Victoria's accession. I would also like to suggest that those who enjoy this movie should watch the BBC series ""Edward the King' which traces the career of Prince Bertie, the future Edward VII. The portrayal of Queen Victoria in that series is far less flattering than in ""The Young Victoria."" Though she was unquestionably a great queen, she was, unfortunately, a considerably less wonderful parent. She treated her nine children like servants, and made it quite clear she had little but disdain for Bertie, whom she blamed for Prince Albert's early death. That, however, is another story, and that reality does nothing to diminish our pleasure in this portrayal of the young queen.",1452988800,,1254,5.0047846889952154
