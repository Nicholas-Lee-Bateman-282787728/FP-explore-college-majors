1898350,5,B00009YXBK,"Kristin McGee is an instructor at ""Crunch."" I love her yoga workouts because she is serious about yoga and makes each workout enjoyable while still challenging you to your limit! This is a fast-paced Ashtanga-style workout.

An Ashtanga-style workout presents a series of postures that produce intense internal heat and purifying sweat to detoxify the organs and muscles. You will feel the improved circulation and no one will have to tell you to ""breathe deeply"" You will breathe deeply because you need to.

This is definitely an advanced workout because it moves so fast, there is really no time to actually learn the moves. You have to know what the poses are and move very quickly from one to the other. This is an outdoor workout in Phoenix, Arizona. This is quite the colorful workout. Not only are you outdoors with greenery in the background, there are red flowers, large red mats and blue/purple yoga mats.

Some of the exercises you will be doing include:

Sun Salutations
Downward Facing Dog
Awkward Chair (chair pose)
Rotating Triangle
Plank Push-Up
Forward Bend
Warrior Stretches
Standing Stretches
On all Fours Series
Seated Stretches & Forward Bends
Backward Bend
Twists - Enter new levels of making yourself into a pretzel.
Final Relaxation
Pilates for Abs

There were quite a few poses that were highly creative and that I've never seen in any yoga video before.

The Special Features Section includes:

1. Position Breakdowns for half moon, eagle pose, dancing shiva, half wheel, full wheel.

2. Instructor Biographies - Nice to see Jess is now certified as a yoga instructor. I was very inspired by his level of practice in the first MTV Yoga workout.

3. Instructor Only Audio - this seems to be a unique feature on MTV yoga workouts.. You can then play your own music for variety.

4. Blue Six Music Video - Nice to play while you are flat on your back after this workout. Maybe you could say: ""Ahhhhh"" a few times and get in a few minutes of meditation. That is what I ended up doing. This workout is pretty strenuous and therefore the word: power.

The only problem with the special features and bio section was the back tracking you have to do to get back to the main menu. They should have had ""main menu"" on all those other pages. It wasn't that difficult to back track, but requires an added level of patience. Maybe that is part of this routine. ;)

If you are new to Yoga and Pilates, I can highly recommend the first MTV Yoga DVD to learn the poses. Then, try the Winsor Pilates videos. If you can make it through Accelerated Body Sculpting then the Pilates section at the end of this workout will not be that much of a challenge. It is a short section to tone and tighten, but the instructor expects you to know how to do all the Pilates moves and fairly quickly.

While the cover says: ""We incorporate beginner, intermediate and advanced versions in one routine,"" the problem for beginners is going to be the frustration they feel at trying to not only learn the correct position, but keep balance and follow the ""poses"" in a fast sequence. Speed is going to be the problem. Yes, there are instructors for each level, but the speed is all the same for every level. I think it would have been amazing if they had taken this routine and made it more accessible to all levels. Say, have three different speeds, beginner, intermediate and advanced speed.

Also, you don't hold poses like ""warrior"" for longer than a second. I would have liked to have spent more time on each pose, but if that is also your preference, then you will love the first MTV Yoga workout. This workout seems to be more about stamina and getting the body warmed up and burning calories.

There are also some pretty intense balancing poses (dancing shiva) and strength poses (half and full wheel, imagine being on all fours upside down) that will give intermediate and advanced students some great challenges.

For those who are advanced, this will be yoga heaven. I'm probably less than intermediate and I made it all the way to the end. I just was not doing all the poses to their full extent and many of the poses might take a year to learn properly. Yoga requires a lot of flexibility and this takes time.

What I did notice was that I was stretching further than I've ever stretched before and this might have been due to the excellent warm-up sun salutation routine at the start.

I look forward to future MTV workouts because I like the music they choose and the instruction is inspirational and the workout really gives you the results you are looking for. I'd love to see Kristin make a MTV Pilates workout and maybe even a stretching DVD.

For this workout, you will need:

Yoga Mat (no other yoga tools/blocks, etc. are needed)

Comfortable tight fitting yoga outfit that sticks to you like glue, otherwise any loose clothing will get in the way of your speed. Jockey Activewear has some silky soft outfits that are perfect for this type of workout.

Enjoy! This is a great challenge and the results are a calm mind, strong body and a powerful sense of accomplishment.

1898351,4,B00009YXBK,"I agree with a previous viewer in the fact that the warmup is hurried, and the positions aren't held very long, and the corpse pose is not held very long either.  However, I would not go so far as to say that this isn't yoga.  If you are the type of person who is very much into the spirtual side of yoga, and a slower pace with your yoga, don't bother. Besides did you REALLY expect spirtuality from a MTV ;-)?  I have been practising yoga a few years now, and I found the video challenging and fun.  There are some ashtanga-like aspects to the flow (kinda like an ashtanga-lite, for those who are not quite ready for the entire Primary Series :-)).  Once you get past the hurried sun-salutations, the workout gets better.  I particularly liked the balance and seated poses.  I especially liked the variation with beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of poses.  It gave me either modifications, or a way to deepen the pose. Some of the poses Kristin does can be found in the Primary Series of Ashtanga yoga (i.e. triangle, reverse-triangle, most of the seated stretching series, jumping in and out of poses, etc.).  The Pilates at the end of the tape is not bad either, a good way to work on abs after a fairly intense 45 minutes.  However, I don't think Windsor and other pilates gurus have much to worry about from Kristin as a pilates instructor.  Overall, this a solid yoga tape for a person with experience.  The level of the workout does assume you know a certain amount of yoga.  I would suggest this tape/dvd to any intermediate/advanced student looking for an Ashtanga-like workout.",1066953600,27,1600,4.6113074204946995
1898352,5,B00009YXBK,"This DVD was really great after I became advanced with the first MTV Yoga video. Using this DVD, I am a beginner all over again. There are many new poses introduced, some are also familiar poses, but more advanced versions. I would definately recommend this DVD to anyone who is more advanced with yoga. If you are a beginner, try the first MTV Yoga DVD. That is also an excellent video to use when you are just starting out. For every pose there different variations depending on how far advanced you are. Also, in this new DVD, there is also a bonus track of pilates moves to tone your abs. A++",1065916800,2,596,4.378378378378378
1898353,5,B00009YXBK,"The people who are saying it's not yoga must be unaware of this style of yoga.  The fast flowing from one pose to another is what a sun salutation IS.  This is how a good intermediate/advanced yoga class goes.  DON'T buy it if you've never taken a yoga class.  The DVD does not give specific instructions on how to do the poses: you have to know all that before you do it.  But if you've done some yoga and want a DVD that will kick your butt, this is a great one.",1065916800,5,464,4.0
1898354,4,B00009YXBK,"I took yoga classes years ago and loved them. Now I've decided to exercise regularly again. I chose MTV Power Yoga because it didn't seem too easy nor too difficult. That turned out to be true for me. This 45-minute workout is just challenging enough. It's fun, too. I actually look forward to exercising every day, a feeling I've never had. And I've already lost 3 pounds.",1064793600,4,373,4.582089552238806
1898365,5,B00009YXBK,"If you're looking for a challenging and invigorating workout, this is the dvd for you.  A warning to those who are looking for a more relaxing workout, keep looking.  One of the best parts about this workout is that it challenges me every time I use it and have never been able to complete it without lots of sweat and burn.  The cool down is well done and I love the short pilates at the end.  Well done kristin mcgee.",1398902400,,419,4.2
1898366,5,B00009YXBK,"This yoga is not for a beginner looking for a serene meditative yoga experience.  This is an intense workout!  I did this workout and there were some poses that were beyond me, but I just stayed with the initial pose when the rest went on to the more advanced forms.  I broke a sweat doing this workout and I could feel the muscles working hard.  The music has a beat, but is not too outrageous or obtrusive.  I like this yoga workout--it lives up to its name of Power Yoga!",1389052800,,474,4.222222222222222
1898367,4,B00009YXBK,"I like how she emphasizes breathing and flow between the movements.  There is a degree of challenge, yet it would be nice to have other options within the video (it only has one 40 minute routine with a small bonus).",1385337600,,216,4.4
1898368,4,B00009YXBK,"This is a shorter video, only 45 minutes of actual yoga.  It's enjoyable and high energy, but as stated by others, not for beginners - it's not difficult but she does NOT explain how to do the poses properly as a beginning video would do.  She gets into it and keeps moving.  She did an MTV Yoga video too and breaks down the poses better in that one (I actually slightly prefer the MTV Yoga video overall).  As someone who does Power Yoga / vinyasa pretty regularly, this wasn't a huge challenge to me, but it did get my heart rate up and my mind in the right place, which is fine for a 45 minute video.  The shorter length helps me squeeze it in when an hour to hour and a half long practice isn't feasible.  It's a good addition to my collection, but not what I'd choose as a standalone, and not for beginners.",1339200000,,813,4.17948717948718
1898369,4,B00009YXBK,This is an advance yoga program. I really do not recommend this DVD for beginners  because it may be discourage by starters due to the difficulty of postures.,1335744000,,158,4.642857142857143
1898370,5,B00009YXBK,"I got this video back in 2007 and just recently started using it again, this has always been one of my favorite yoga.videos! I would say I used to be advanced, and this was a great workout! It also provides easier options, but I'm.not.sure I would recommend for beginners only because it is a power yoga so it is fast paced!",1331683200,,324,4.327868852459017
1898371,2,B00009YXBK,"If you have never tried yoga or are at a beginner level this video is NOT for you! The  moves themselves are not necessarily the difficulties you will run into. This video is meant to be aerobic, so the moves are done quickly with no holding for many of the poses. The problem with this is that you do not get enough time to get into the poses and postures correctly before moving on. This leads to very sloppy yogic posture which can strain and injure some of your muscles! I am at an intermediate yoga level, and I have a hard time going through the sun salutations in proper posture. In my opinion one would receive a much more efficient workout by holding some of these poses long enough to ensure correct posture, and to give those muscles a chance to start burning! Another serious problem with this video is the lack of instructions. The instructor does not give a single notification for safely completing poses! Her other  yogis on the video also do not represent lower skill level pose variations, only more difficult. She also gives no description of what downward dog, chatarunga, and many other poses actually are; she simply says what pose to move into. Again, not a problem if you are at an intermediate level, but as a beginner you NEED to be familiar with these basic poses before you try yoga at a faster pace! My third complaint is her fluidity throughout and the choice of poses. The entire first half consists of very repetitive variations of sun salutation, which becomes tedious. The rest of the video flows okay, continuing to balancing postures before moving to floor moves. The poses in the second half start at an intermediate level with moves like bow pose (again, with no safety precautions addressed). The instructor tends to make stretches towards the end unbalanced by not counting evenly for both sides on moves like forward bends on each leg. Please heed this warning if you have knee or wrist problems!! Most of the poses that are actually held are very hard on the knees and wrists! I do not have existing problems with these areas but every time I do this video my knees hurt the next day. That could be from doing postures incorrectly, or simply the strain implemented on these areas from the poses. Either way, that seems to be a fault on the instructor for either not explaining correct posture, or not choosing variations on the poses for people who need it. My final complaint is how the video is ended. The final shavasana is less than a minute long, and she tells you to stop paying attention to your breath and 'just be'. Every yoga class I have attended, the instructor has said to focus on only the breath to quiet the mind. And if your mind wanders you should bring your attention back to the breath again. Although since the pose lasts longer than a minute I guess that does not matter in this video. Finally, she does not even end the video with 'namaste'.

Overall this video feels more like torture than a good workout, since I feel more aches and pains afterward than fitness improvement. If you are an intermediate to advanced yogi, this video might be for you since you are already familiar with correct postures. I would recommend attending a yoga class instead though to get more out of your workout. DO NOT TRY THIS IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER TO YOGA! YOU CAN EASILY INJURE YOURSELF!",1329782400,,3336,4.575250836120401
1898372,4,B00009YXBK,"This is a very good yoga workout. Kristen McGee is an awesome instructor, and she gives great cues. I just wish it was more cardio and less balance postures. I really loved the pilates addition at the end. I love Kristen's Weight Loss DVD. I do that one at least twice a week. This is a nice addition to my workout.",1318982400,,315,4.180327868852459
1898373,5,B00009YXBK,"Let me start by stating that this dvd is NOT for beginners or anyone looking for an introduction to yoga.
  I am a runner. I run for fun/fitness anywhere between 18-25 miles per week. I was looking for something stimulating that offered beneficial stretching plus a challenging core/cardio workout when I found this dvd. Ever since I started running I had struggled with illiotiboital band pain and thought that yoga might help me. Did it ever! Ever since I started using this dvd I haven't suffered since. My running form has improved along with my muscle tone and overall physical/mental fitness, and I'm never bored.
  I've done this dvd SO many times I've actually got the asanas memorized and only need this audio in order to run through the sequences. I do it in the morning before work 3-5 times per week and always feel refreshed and energized when I'm finished. In my opinion there is NO BETTER WAY TO START YOUR DAY.",1288137600,2,926,4.662576687116564
1898374,1,B00009YXBK,"I have been doing yoga for years and while I wouldn't consider myself a ""yogi"" I can generally make it through even an advanced yoga class.  I thought that this would be a fun, more interesting yoga workout for home.  I thought wrong.  The warm up is not even a warm-up, the music doesn't make sense with the flow of the movements and there is very little instruction.  The instruction that is given is unclear and can definitely lead to someone getting hurt! I have tried this video a few times and found it difficult, painful, and probably the worst yoga video I've found.",1270684800,5,574,4.490384615384615
1898385,5,B00009YXBK,"I have tried sooooo many yoga dvds.. this is an old favorite that I just recently returned to and I am so glad I did. Better than I remember in fact. About 2 years ago I did this workout 5 mornings/week for about a month and was completely toned without and other strength training. It's the perfect length of time, I feel great afterwards, and there's no creepy yoga-y vibes like in most yoga dvds.. pure, modern, fresh, young, contemporary yoga.. Glad to be back!",1265241600,4,465,4.482352941176471
1898386,5,B00009YXBK,"This DVD really is not as hard as everyone makes it out to be. I really liked it because it's not difficult yoga pose-wise, it just forces you to move very, very quickly. It's not a lazy person's excuse for a workout. It's non-stop & definitely the fastest pace yoga class I have ever been a part of. It's not boring like many DVDs in the yoga/pilates genre tend to be. I mainly do my workout in the gym, and I thought I would change it up a bit a couple of days a week. So do this when you wake up, have had your coffee, and are ready to move!",1264982400,,544,3.90990990990991
1898387,5,B00009YXBK,"I bought this twice (my first copy got stolen) because I can not live without it! This gets me sweating within 15 minutes and is the perfect warm up to any exercise and a mild workout itself! I have TONS of energy after going through this dvd, even if I only do half or skip around (which I don't normally). It makes me want to work out even more! =) I had her MTV Pilates dvd and never even made it to the end, not once. I've done all kinds of dance/pilates/yoga workouts at home and taken some yoga classes but this was my first one and is the only one I can stick to so far! I didn't get every pose correct the first time I did it but it got easy fast. I had never done any kind of yoga before this so I figured that was normal...I've been addicted to this workout for YEARS now!",1261353600,,782,3.9556962025316458
1898388,5,B00009YXBK,LOVE this workout. Have used it for two years. It gets your heartrate up without being difficult. Three levels are demonstrated throughout so it can match any level from the yoga newbie to pro.,1260662400,,193,4.705882352941177
1898389,5,B00009YXBK,This is what our instructor currently does in class. It is a fast paced work out. We have the room temperature set at 104 degrees. If you want more of a work out routine- then this is a great video. If you enjoy the relaxing benefis of yoga and the hold of the pose- this is not for you.,1243468800,,287,3.8813559322033897
1898390,5,B00009YXBK,This is a fast paced and challenging workout.  I could only do part of it as a beginner but I stuck with it and greatly improved my posture and flexibility. Yoga for the MTV generation.,1229385600,,185,4.285714285714286
1898391,4,B00009YXBK,"My idea of yoga is Yoga Mind and Body by Ali Mcgraw, I have been using it for years and lately added Yoga Shakti by Shiva Rea.  Aside from these 2 I do pilates.  Imagine my surprise the 1st time I did MTV Power Yoga, I could not keep up. My heart was surging like a race horse and all those downward facing dogs made my arms tremble, add to that my shoulders ached. For the 1st few times (about 4x or more) I just did the sun salutations and called it a day.  I have done half the workout more times than I have done the entire work-out, but I liked it and it was getting easier so I kept doing it.

 Earlier this year I gained weight and went up to 52kg.  Bear in mind that at 5ft 3 inches that's in now way large, but on my frame gaining 2-3kg makes me feel slow and heavy.  For some weeks now I have noticed that my clothes are much loser (I have lost quite a few inches) and I am back at 49.5 kg. I started doing MTV Yoga in June and continued doing it on and off until the middle of August and haven't done it since then, now its October 3rd.
The reason I am writing this review is I ran into someone today who I haven't seen in 2 years and after a few minutes they commented that my face had gotten quite slimmer.  I came home and for some reason it clicked that the only thing I did new this summer was that I started doing power yoga (and drinking green tea).  So today I decided to do the workout again after stopping for about 6 weeks and lo and behold I could finish the entire yoga workout!!! No shaking like before (ok just a tiny bit), my arms didn't hurt from the downward facing dog, and all in all my body had gotten a lot stronger. Even though this DVD is FAST I was able to do it with some semblance of elegance and without getting completely out of breath.

Think of this DVD as strength training, aerobics, and flexibility workout in one, using yoga moves.  If you are looking for meditative yoga movements to slow down and find your spirit then this is not it. If you want to get stronger, work you heart, and stretch your body then you have the right DVD. I absolutely love this work out now because I can get stronger without lifting weights and I can raise my heart rate without doing all the jumping and high impact stuff.
I don't recommend this workout for beginners.  I was not a beginner to yoga when I started, nor was anywhere close to being overweight, and I am relatively fit (I have been commuting by bicyle for the last 4 years).  Even so, this workout worked me over to the point where I had to quit half way many times.  That being said, if you already have experience with yoga you can start using this DVD and sloowly build your way up.  Stick with it and you will get stronger, the shaking will get less and eventually stop, and your breathing will be less haggard and become more even, and you may drop some inches.  That was the result I experienced.",1222992000,4,2892,4.110124333925399
1898392,4,B00009YXBK,"I personally LOVE this video.  It's one of the best yoga videos ever!  That said, it is not a typical yoga video.  It is POWER yoga and it is very challenging.  She moves fast through the salutations and the standing postures.  But it slows down a little for balances, twists, and bends.  I say it might be ambitious for a beginner because the first time I did it, I found it a little hard to follow.  And I had done yoga (although mostly Hatha) before.  But once you get through the first time, it gets easier and easier to follow.  I like that it is only about 45 minutes long and afterward you feel like you really got a good workout.  I also like that the bonus ab pilates workout is only 10 more minutes.  Overall, I think it is a fabulous video for those looking for a challenging 'yoga-cardio' workout.",1215561600,3,809,4.291390728476821
1898393,4,B00009YXBK,"Love the DVD, but some advice. I am a beginner and I just decided to make the move from beginner to 'power' yoga. I DO NOT recommend this DVD if you are a beginner and you haven't become thoroughly familiar with her other mtv yoga DVD, the red colored one. In fact, together they are both great. I recommend starting with the red one, then after at least a month of practice with it you can move onto the blue one. But don't go blue first, unless you are 'practiced'. AND, even when you are getting good with the red one and you wanna' move onto the blue one, watch it through first, just to figure out the complicated moves 'cause she goes fast.

The warm-up is a bit rushed, but I got this DVD because I wanted a heart pumping yoga workout, and that is exactly what this is. There are lots of different levels presented in the video, so whether you are a beginner or an advanced yogi, I think you will enjoy this video. The instructor cues the breathing and the poses really well. I always get a great workout from this DVD!",1199404800,,510,4.268041237113402
1898405,4,B00009YXBK,"true, it's not real yoga.  Still, it moves faster than traditional yoga so it's easier to get through on days when I don't feel like I have enough patience to enter the yoga trance-like state.  It still leaves you with the invigorated feeling that yoga stretches & positions give you.  It's challenging; it will make you sweat; it builds beautiful long, lean muscles...but I hate the music.  Only thing that really, really bugs me.  Overall, in just 3 weeks of doing this 4-5 times/week (I have a baby and don't get much more time than an hour/day), I lost weight and dropped from an almost-size6 to a true size 4 and looked noticeably toner & more fit.  That's why I love this workout.  It's an MTV workout...who really expects it to be an authentic yoga workout?",1185580800,3,764,4.573529411764706
1898406,5,B00009YXBK,This is the greatest workout video ever. In one day my body was defined in a wonderful way. The workout on here gets you sweating and your heart beating right away.

1898408,2,B00009YXBK,"Two and a half stars.  I think the routine is fun but the alignment is horrible!  The routine is a little different which is nice, sure some of the poses should be held for five breaths but that is not a big complaint for me it is just not as challenging as it could be.  My foundation in yoga is Iyengar which I bring into all other yoga, so when I saw the way the asanas are executed I was appalled, especially with Jesse who is supposed to be demonstrating the more advanced version of the pose.  Jesse can't stack his shoulders, keep his hips aligned, has a rounded back, shrugged shoulders, does not know proper foot placement or stance, basically don't do anything he does!  If he does not improve his alignment, he will have serious lower back problems.  The instuctors alignment is decent but her hips are not always aligned.  Challenge yourself and square or parallel your hips in standing split and down dog split, it is a lot more challenging than opening the hips like they do.  Also the music is pretty cheesy, MTV used to be cutting edge in music  but now they are just mainstream commercial hacks.

So if you are familiar with yoga and power yoga (don't do this if you are novice) and know proper alignment you might like this workout.  I reccommend using the instuctors voice only option on the dvd and put on some good music of your own!  I turn the dvd off when it comes to the relaxation and do my own, I do this with a lot of yoga videos because savasana is hardly ever adequate on them.",1157587200,7,1507,4.3428571428571425
1898409,2,B00009YXBK,"This is a challenging workout designed to get your heart pumping and muslces revving, which is exactly what I was looking for -- but there are several issues with it. I don't even mind that there's no warm up -- I can easily do one on my own. But there are other things that are less forgivable.

First of all, Jesse a yoga expert? Please. He may be a ""certified yoga teacher,"" but even my novice eyes can see that his alignment is far from perfect and that he's not nearly as limber as others, who've been practicing yoga far longer. Jesse is proof positive that they are indeed handing out yoga teaching certificates in cereal boxes these days.

Also, the two people who are supposedly demonstrating the modified moves are doing nothing of the kind. Whenever they are on camera, which isn't nearly often enough, they're doing the full expression of the poses. I don't even see any modifications of the really difficult poses. Considering how much I love my Crunch Fat Burning Yoga DVD, I'd have expected better from a Crunch instructor.

If you're looking for an equally challenging yoga DVD, but weren't born able to do the full wheel, try Yoga Zone's Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance. It's a great workout with actual modifications for those still learning.",1153267200,5,1266,4.693693693693693
1898410,5,B00009YXBK,"I refrained from buying this DVD over the negative reviews stating it was too fast, not really yoga, etc...  Plus, I thought to myself, ""How can anything produced by MTV be anything but a trite waste of time?""  Now I am sorry I waited so long to purchase this high energy, fun, upbeat way to work my entire body, increase my energy, and focus my mind.  First, those who think the interesting opening , crescent lunge salutations are too fast need to merely practice and practice this maneuvre the way someone would learn a complex dance routine or memorize lines in a script.  Meditation, the true mind/body link can occur with any yogic sequence once the physical movements are first completely studied and learned.  Realize that even though this workout may move at a faster rate than five breath Ashtanga asana holds, it is still way slower than Kundalini yoga kriyas like the Warrior Workout.  Having studied both Kundalini and Ashtanga and possessing a vast power yoga library including most of Baptiste and Kest, I was shocked to discover how incredible and concise this product is.  I love learning new techniques and upon first watching this shockingly energetic video, I became obsessed with learning the first salutation which requires both mental and physical coordination.  Each time I do this workout, I feel more meditative, more in control, and more alert.  At first I assumed I would injure myself doing something in it (having hip and occasional back problems), but was amazed at how I felt very evenly worked out, more flexible, and ready to glide through life.  Also, I think Kristen's breath pacing during the standing pose sequence was as good as any other DVD I own.  If you love a great short 50 minute workout and aren't afraid to tackle initially intimidating movements, you will live this MTV super hit.",1152230400,7,1829,4.84887459807074
1898411,4,B00009YXBK,"This routine is a good one, but it does require that you have some familiarity with yoga.  There is not a lot of explanation of the poses, so it would not be good for a beginner.  I definitely felt the results the next day though.",1151971200,2,230,4.088888888888889
1898412,3,B00009YXBK,"To add my two cents:
She did a great job of telling you the content of this workout.
The layout was cool with her & two girls & guy helping at different levels. The music is cool, but it makes me feel like I'm in an aerobics class.
The yoga session is about 40 min long with a 1-2 min into & a 3 min meditation at the end. There is an additional pilates for ab for 5 min after that.
There were some great standing twists & seated twists & bends I don't normally see in most mainstream yoga dvds that felt great.
It really moves so fast by the time you get into a pose, she's already going in to the next one during the sun salutations. I have 30 yoga dvds & been doing it for 4 years & I still couldn't keep up.
There is almost no instruction, so don't buy this unless you have taken classes or own several beginner yoga dvds. This is only for people looking to use yoga for stretching/fitness only, not for being more aware of your body at all. The music is also wrong, there is plenty of trance, ambient or new age music like Enigma that would compliment yoga, not make you feel more jittery.",1139875200,6,1094,4.069444444444445

If you are looking for something slower try MTV Yoga, it goes at a slower pace but still is a great workout.",1136332800,3,353,4.2835820895522385
1898425,4,B00009YXBK,"I am what I thought to be an experienced Yoga practitioner having been practicing for about 3 years, however this is the most challenging Yoga video that I have ever done.  It leaves you feeling energetic and invigorated. Kristin McGee hosts 3 other MTV fitness series videos including MTV Yoga, MTV Pilates, and MTV Pilates Mix.  I highly recommend all of these videos, they provide an intense workout while still offering variations for different levels of expertise.

I will warn you though that Power Yoga is difficult and challenging.  It moves at a rapid pace, especially through the beginning Sun Salutations.  You must have a working knowledge of Yoga poses before attempting this video otherwise you will get extremely frustrated with the instruction.  I would recommend doing MTV Yoga first where Kristin provides much more instruction and a slower pace.  Or, watch the video through a couple times before even attempting to do it.

Overall, it is one of my favorite Yoga videos!",1134345600,3,989,5.024539877300613

1898427,3,B00009YXBK,"Though this is a decent workout, I was disappointed with it.  There should have been greater instruction for some of the more intricate poses, or at least a warning that the DVD assumes a working knowledge of yoga.  I agree that some of the poses could be dangerous, and the flow is fast.  The music got on my nerves after a while.  I think there are better power yoga videos out there.  I would not purchase another workout featuring this instructor.",1119312000,2,451,4.518518518518518
1898428,1,B00009YXBK,"I've been practicing yoga for over 10 years now; all forms in studios and at home. Ashtanga (Power) and Bikram (Hot) being my favorite. Sometimes I get into the spiritual aspects of Yoga whenever I need to, but mostly I enjoy it for the way it gives me that ""Yoga Body"".

I was surprised at how terrible the MTV Power Yoga DVD is, since I believe the MTV Yoga DVD is wonderful for beginners. I just wanted something a little different with some good music and pure work-out aspects.

The warm-up is too fast. No matter how advanced a student you are, your warm-up should always be slow and gentle... hence ""warm-up"".

The flow into Warrior One is incorrect and dangerous. The instructor tells you to flatten your rear foot first before stepping forward with your front leg - NO!! This will cause you to pull muscles in your lower back. You should ALWAYS step forward with your front leg first, then turn and plant your rear foot.

During a series of Warrior One and Bent Knee Triangles, you are instructed to move directly from the Warrior One into the Triangle. Huh? What about that little pose in between called the Warrior Two?!?

If that's not enough to turn you off, how about the floor pose stretching series she does with one leg (shin) bent underneath you. Think tearing your knee ligaments... I know some Yoga instructors that would NEVER attempt those variations. Hero pose is easier on your knees than what this instructor has you do.

Simply put, this yoga does not flow well, I'd say it barely flows at all and the poses are presented incorrectly. Anyone that is advanced enough to do some of her variations safely would not be using a DVD to instruct them... and remember, I've been doing this for 10 years!

By the way, the music is horrible! You would think that for an MTV production they would have some great music to work-out to. I guess you could use the instructor voice music off feature and put on your own stuff in the background, but this whole DVD is so bad that wouldn't help.

Try these other DVD's instead:

MTV Yoga (Wonderful for Extreme Beginners)

American Power Yoga, Strength (Great for All Levels)

It gets your heart pumping and really works your legs and arms. It's a lot of fun, and I always feel energetic, limber and relaxed after finishing it. Some of the poses, such as Eagle and Dancing Shiva are challenging, but I really enjoy seeing how much I improve each time. The only bummer is that it's only 45 minutes, I'd like to see the same type of workout at 60 minutes or more. I wouldn't recommend this one for absolute beginners, but for advanced beginners, intermediate or even advanced it's a great quick workout and a MUST BUY!",1112227200,,663,4.3983739837398375

I've done other power yoga DVDs and even took a class with an instructor, but they don't come close to level of this DVD. It's very fast paced at the beginning and it's tough at first, but things slow down and stay that way until the end. There's also a great pilates workout for your abs at the end. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for beginners though because of the fast pace and some poses are a bit difficult.

1898434,3,B00009YXBK,"I think this is a great workout. Today was my first attempt and I have to say, I sweat more than I have in a long time in Yoga workouts (but I'm not an avid practitioner!)  I have been doing the Crunch Fat-Burning Yoga, which I like a lot, but this one made me sweat more... in the first 15 mins. and I like all the standing poses. This DVD is great because: 1- They actually use the real names of the positions.  2- It made me sweat like hell! 3-Its very quick in the beginning but then you can look forward to some slower poses 4- time flies with this one.  5- the instructor does not always prompt the position for very long which is fine b/c the DVD has a section where you can go through the positions BEFORE you start so that you don't have to get too confused about what's going on if y ou don't know the Moon pose for example.  6- there is a quick pilates workout for abs at the end. I have Winsor pilates and its' the same stuff... BUT there are SOME things I'd consider before purchase 1-It moves TOO quickly. Especially for someone who is not a pro. So be careful not to hurt yourself on the cobra pose (thats the one i have trouble with).  In all, I like this DVD a lot! Feel energized, etc.  The setting is nice, in the Arizona mountains.

1898445,4,B00009YXBK,"This DVD puts a whole new meaning on Power Yoga.  I've done a few different variations of power yoga but none have given me such a challenging workout like this one did.  I've been doing yoga for a while now and even I had a bit of a struggle to keep up the fast pace.  The poses are very common to yoga, they're just done at a fairly fast pace.  Even though there are three other people doing different variations of the poses, it's really difficult to see them.  At the end of the workout there's a brief Pilates abs workout.  Five minutes after I did it, my abs are still burning.  This is one workout that I'd highly recommend.",1078444800,,631,4.208333333333333
1898446,5,B00009YXBK,"Kristin McGee is an instructor at ""Crunch."" I love her yoga workouts because she is serious about yoga and makes each workout enjoyable while still challenging you to your limit! This is a fast-paced Ashtanga-style workout.
An Ashtanga-style workout presents a series of postures that produce intense internal heat and purifying sweat to detoxify the organs and muscles. You will feel the improved circulation and no one will have to tell you to ""breathe deeply"" You will breathe deeply because you need to.
This is definitely an advanced workout because it moves so fast, there is really no time to actually learn the moves. You have to know what the poses are and move very quickly from one to the other. This is quite the colorful workout. Not only are you outdoors with greenery in the background, there are red flowers, large red mats and blue/purple yoga mats.
Some of the exercises you will be doing include:
Sun Salutations
Downward Facing Dog
Awkward Chair (chair pose)
Rotating Triangle
Plank Push-Up
Forward Bend
Warrior Stretches
Standing Stretches
On all Fours Series
Seated Stretches & Forward Bends
Backward Bend
Twists - Enter new levels of making yourself into a pretzel.
Final Relaxation
Pilates for Abs
There were quite a few poses that were highly creative and that I've never seen in any yoga video before.
If you are new to Yoga and Pilates, I can highly recommend the first MTV Yoga video to learn the poses. Then, try the Winsor Pilates videos. If you can make it through Accelerated Body Sculpting then the Pilates section at the end of this workout will not be that much of a challenge. It is a short section to tone and tighten, but the instructor expects you to know how to do all the Pilates moves and fairly quickly.
While the cover says: ""We incorporate beginner, intermediate and advanced versions in one routine,"" the problem for beginners is going to be the frustration they feel at trying to not only learn the correct position, but keep balance and follow the ""poses"" in a fast sequence. Speed is going to be the problem. Yes, there are instructors for each level, but the speed is all the same for every level. I think it would have been amazing if they had taken this routine and made it more accessible to all levels. Say, have three different speeds, beginner, intermediate and advanced speed.
Also, you don't hold poses like ""warrior"" for longer than a second. I would have liked to have spent more time on each pose, but if that is also your preference, then you will love the first MTV Yoga workout. This workout seems to be more about stamina and getting the body warmed up and burning calories.
There are also some pretty intense balancing poses (dancing shiva) and strength poses (half and full wheel, imagine being on all fours upside down) that will give intermediate and advanced students some great challenges.
For those who are advanced, this will be yoga heaven. I'm probably less than intermediate and I made it all the way to the end. I just was not doing all the poses to their full extent and many of the poses might take a year to learn properly. Yoga requires a lot of flexibility and this takes time.
What I did notice was that I was stretching further than I've ever stretched before and this might have been due to the excellent warm-up sun salutation routine at the start.
I look forward to future MTV workouts because I like the music they choose and the instruction is inspirational and the workout really gives you the results you are looking for.
For this workout, you will need:
Yoga Mat (no other yoga tools/blocks, etc. are needed)
Comfortable tight fitting yoga outfit that sticks to you like glue, otherwise any loose clothing will get in the way of your speed. Jockey Activewear has some silky soft outfits that are perfect for this type of workout.
Enjoy! This is a great challenge and the results are a calm mind, strong body and a powerful sense of accomplishment.
Also look for MTV Pilates and MTV Yoga. They finally made
a Pilates workout!!!

1898447,5,B00009YXBK,"This is the best power yoga video I've tried.  The poses are challenging and repeated more than once.  I note that there are some comments about the poses not being held long, but the whole point of power yoga is that you don't need to hold the poses for long periods of time.  Your body already knows the poses and thus you don't need to hold them.  Since this moves very fast, it allows you to repeat the sequences several times.
Be warned: This is not for the beginner.  I would recommend watching the video first before doing.  I definitely recommend this video over Rodney Yee's videos or doing the yoga videos from Gaiam.  MTV's power yoga video definitely gets your heart rate up.",1074470400,3,687,4.491935483870968

You will sweat, it's very hard at first, but gets easier; and there are other people on the DVD that you can watch for easier moderations of the poses.

It was more akin to aerobics than yoga.  I'm used to doing yoga for the stretches.  You need to stretch before you do this one.
There's a big focus on balancing versus stretching in this DVD.  The poses aren't explained very well.  The DVD bonus that's supposed to do this is pretty lame.",1073520000,4,451,4.223529411764706

Having been doing yoga on and off for about 4 years now I am pretty familiar with the poses. This workout is pretty challenging and I wouldn't recommend it for the beginner. If you do this workout the legs will be worked out way more than in any other yoga workout. The arms are pretty nicely worked out too. However McGee's poses focus nicely to balance the whole body. After three days of eating sensibly and doing this workout I have abdominal muscles and already am toned and tight.

It has a smoother pace, the scenery is pleasant, and that stupid Lori chick from 'Real World' isn't on this one (she's featured on the first one for some lame marketing reason).  McGee's voice is never aggrevating.  At first it was a challenge, but after a few times I got the hang of it and do it 3 times a week.  Awesome workout.

1898454,4,B00009YXBK,"definitely one of the better power yoga videos out there. the workout does start out at a quick pace like many reviewers have pointed out, but this owes itself to the common power yoga practise of generating a lot of heat in the body early in the workout to enhance the stretching and strengthening exercises that follow. sticking with tradition the pace slows considerably after the warm-up period ends. the instructor is perfect for the younger audiences MTV can expect in that she has a youthful, upbeat delivery, yet at the same time she's disciplined and adheres to the most important yoga prinicpal, which is focus on the breath.  the routine is a nice balance of challenging poses you can do at home alone without needing to have added assistance that you would find in a yoga studio.  there's a lot of emphasis on shoulder and hamstring stretching, and upper body and leg strengthening. the trance-like music is awesome too.
my only real beefs with the tape are the lengthy and loud MTV commercials that precede the workout and the too short relaxation period at the end. would have given it 5 stars but for these.

There were a lot of moves I couldn't do because they expected straight legs and the beginner had her hands on the floor- I am just not that flexible.
