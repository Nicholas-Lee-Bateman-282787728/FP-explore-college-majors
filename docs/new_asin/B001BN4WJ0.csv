3495211,5,B001BN4WJ0,"I love all of these old shows so much. Reminds me of better days when life was easier. These are all so good and the quality is really good. Honestly, for the price you can't beat it. This special holiday-themed collection selects from the Paramount vaults eight very special episodes of vintage TV favorites, beginning with "" 'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" (original airdate: Dec. 24, 1955), an episode of The Honeymooners in which Ralph Kramden discovers the unique gift he's keeping hidden from Alice is identical to the one Trixie just gave her. I Love Lucy's 1956 ""I Love Lucy Christmas Show"" (Dec. 24, 1956) is a clip-heavy show flashing back to the program's earlier years, while The Andy Griffith Show's ""A Christmas Story"" (Dec. 19, 1960) finds Sheriff Andy trying to figure out a compassionate way of letting the moonshiner he's got in lockup properly celebrate the holiday. In ""The Voice of Christmas"" (Dec. 19, 1969), from the first year of The Brady Bunch, laryngitis figures to foil Carol's big ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" solo at church, until little Cindy seeks Santa's intervention. As the title suggests, ""A Full House at Christmas"" (Dec. 12, 1978) from Taxi's first season finds Alex locked in a high-stakes poker game at the garage with Louie's even-less-pleasant younger brother. The Dickens-themed ""A Keaton Christmas Carol"" (Dec. 14, 1983) from Family Ties finds Alex visited in his dreams by ghosts of holidays past, present, and yet to be. Joe, Brian, Helen, and Roy all decide to crash Fay's holiday gathering in the ""Terminal Christmas"" (Dec. 21, 1990) episode from the first season of Wings. And finally, in ""Miracle on Third or Fourth Street"" (Dec. 16, 1993) from the first season of Frasier, a down-in-the-dumps Frasier Crane decides to have Christmas supper in a diner, only to realize he's forgotten his wallet. Fortunately, new friends and the spirit of the day intervene.",1457136000,,1905,4.974921630094044

 Adding Christmas to the mix, I rather was excited. Each episode shares the sprirt of the syndicated show and its meaning of Christmas. ""The Andy Griffith"" episode was a sentimental one for the old man in town is a loner who wants to be in the middle of the holiday celebration.
 Quite happy with this selection. I bought it based on the shows I remembered and the Christmas holiday!",1293235200,,637,4.781818181818182

VIDEO:
The footage on this disc is vintage television, so the DVD format is fullscreen (4:3) NTSC.  The picture quality is good - less so in the earlier shows - but certainly watchable.  The picture quality, as to be expected, is much better in the 'newer' 1980's to 1990's episodes!

HINT: The picture quality is improved if the disc is played on a DVD player with upconversion to 1080p or a blu-ray DVD player.

AUDIO:
Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, Dolby Surround 2.0 - only for the 1980's and 1990's shows.  Close Captions (only) - no subtitles.  :(

3495250,4,B001BN4WJ0,"I have bought some horrible collections and when deciding on this one I was in my send it back mode. It didn't get returned. Don't get me wrong, I love White Christmas, Holiday Inn, Rudolf and It's a wonderful life but I wanted other good holiday tv. This gives you an idea of the shows that celebrated the holidays along with us. Other reviewers pointed out the episodes and particulars, I'll just say while the teen tv is airing I'll enjoy the holiday with this dvd. There's not a miss if you liked the series originally.",1288828800,,523,4.458333333333333
3495251,4,B001BN4WJ0,"I bought this gift for a ""hard to buy for"" person and it was very well received.  The quality was good, and the shows brought back great memories.  Overall, very pleased with this DVD, especially for the price.",1265846400,,210,4.5
3495252,4,B001BN4WJ0,"I can't believe that it took so long for the networks and production companies to realize how much people like these old special episodes, but anyway, they are available now and I'm grateful.

This collection is presented chronologically, starting with ""I Love Lucy"" (which contains special bonus footage), ""The Honeymooners,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" ""Taxi,"" ""Family Ties,"" ""Frasier"" and ""Wings.""

To be honest, I was a little disappointed that some of the shows weren't better. I've never been a ""Lucy"" fan but even as I view it, this wasn't a good episode. I am, however, a ""Honeymooners"" fan and this definitely wasn't a great ep of that wonderful series. The episode of ""Taxi"" was the weakest of the rest, while ""Family Ties"" was the best of the entire collection (""Wings"" and ""Andy Griffith"" also were both especially good, and I never cared for either of those series).

An awesome addition were the ""season's greetings"" animated segues dug out from the CBS archives from who knows when (by looking I'd guess the early '70s).

I hope that these kinds of releases will continue coming from the major networks. I'll certainly keep buying, as they remind me of happier, more carefree Christmases.",1261440000,,1220,4.995073891625616

My favorite are the earliest episodes of I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and The Andy Griffith Show since I was a toddler when they were first shown on TV.  I hope that more Christmas series like this will be produced (and it would be great if they could include some classic Christmas commercials from each of these time periods as well).",1259625600,,435,4.493670886075949

I noticed when Christmas programming is put on DVD's, many have identical episodes of the shows, so you have to be careful when you purchase these DVD's.

3495269,4,B001BN4WJ0,"I can't tell you how much fun it was to go back in time to see these old shows. I don't think any shows of today make a special holiday show anymore because they never know if they are going to be around in December. In the old days you didn't see a rerun until the summer. The only thing I wish they had done was to put a few old commercials with the show. Again remembering my youth, most of the characters did one or two commercials for their sponsors that were shown at the end of the show, some were even tied into the subject from that particular episode..  they are almost as much fun as the show.",1229904000,,604,4.033333333333333
3495270,5,B001BN4WJ0,"Holiday Treats is a wonderful idea that speaks volumes about TV sitcoms and their eagerness to note the Christmas season in a merry, fun, and ever so slightly poignant way. I only hope it inspires other studios to broaden their horizons and attempt other creative compilations instead of just repackaging the same popular movies or imploring people to buy them again in high definition.

A few observations specific to this compilation are easy to make. For instance, almost all of the selected episodes are from the shows' first seasons and thus have the feel of sitcoms still finding their way. The eldest ones, ""Lucy"" and ""Honeymooners"" revel in simplicity, keeping themselves close to the radio program format that often guided early TV. Later works such as ""Taxi"" and ""Frasier"" offer more complexity in characters and circumstances. The two centering on nuclear families, ""Brady Bunch"" and ""Family Ties"", tend to succceed largely due to their settings and group dynamic.

Regardless of how much you've seen of these eight shows in the past (and I'd imagine nearly everyone has seen, or at least knows, a bit), each becomes abundantly familiar in the course of its featured episode. You don't need context or full character backstories. This is just television comedy. It went down smoothly upon first airing and, for the most part, continues to do so today.

Here are synopses and information on the eight episodes of Holiday Treats:

1. I Love Lucy: ""I Love Lucy Christmas Show"" (26:04) (Originally aired December 24, 1956)
In between familiar sources of holiday laughs (Little Ricky's questions about Santa Claus, Fred's errant tree-trimming), clips from past episodes are broadly cued. The featured flashbacks are: Lucy (Lucille Ball) giving Ricky (Desi Arnaz) news of her pregnancy, Lucy's tuneless performance as part of a barbershop quartet, and the group's delivery room rehearsal and run.

Introductory text screens announce that this special was missing for 33 years before CBS found it and aired it in 1989.

It's presented in full here, even leaving a Sanka commercial message intact. The episode is followed by another long-lost-but-rediscovered item: 1951 excerpt ""Jingle Bells"" (3:18) from Season 1's ""Drafted"" that was recreated nearly shot-by-shot in the special's 5-Santa finale.

2. The Honeymooners: ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" (26:00) (Originally aired December 24, 1955)
Gift exchanges are in order, as Ralph (Jackie Gleason) tries to sneak a glimpse of what wife Alice (Audrey Meadows) has gotten him. When he learns that his present for her is neither special nor unique, he does his best to correct it with no money and time running out. The episode ends with the cast wishing its audience a Merry Christmas, which is sometimes cut in syndication.

3. The Andy Griffith Show: ""Christmas Story"" (26:01) (Originally aired December 19, 1960)
Grouchy storeowner Ben Weaver (Will Wright) threatens the merry mood at Mayberry's police station. Meanwhile, sheriff Andy (Andy Griffith) enlists deputy Barney (Don Knotts) to play a skinny Santa.

4. The Brady Bunch: ""The Voice of Christmas"" (25:31) (Originally aired December 19, 1969)
Just days before she's due to sing at Church, Carol (Florence Henderson) comes down with laryngitis. While she's reduced to whispers and wearing a stinky neck wrap prepared by Alice, the other Bradys carry on with Christmas traditions: setting up the tree, a sit on Santa's lap, and presents talk.

5. Taxi: ""A Full House for Christmas"" (24:31) (Originally aired December 12, 1978)
Louie (Danny DeVito) is excited to have his estranged brother Nick (guest Richard Foronjy) visit for Christmas, but soon is angered by Nick's disregard of their mother.
To make things right, Louie bankrolls Alex (Judd Hirsch) in a high-stakes poker match against Nick. This is easily the disc's least Christmassy episode and probably its least mirthful one too.

6. Family Ties: ""A Keaton Christmas Carol"" (24:07) (Originally aired December 14, 1983)
Severely lacking in seasonal spirit  la Ebenezer Scrooge, Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox) is visited by sister-ghosts (Tina Yothers, Justine Bateman) and shown a cheery Christmas past and gloomy potential Christmas future. They serve to adjust his outlook on the holiday.

7. Frasier: ""Miracle on Third or Fourth Street"" (22:12) (Originally aired December 16, 1993)
After an argument with his father, Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) opts to spend Christmas Day not at the family log cabin but at work on his call-in radio show. It's a sad, lonely, and (in the ""Frasier"" tradition) not particularly funny holiday, despite guest callers including Mel Brooks, Rosemary Clooney, and Ben Stiller.

8. Wings: ""A Terminal Christmas"" (22:58) (Originally aired December 21, 1990)
The employees of Nantucket's tiny Tom Nevers Field airport all show up for work on Christmas only have to snow and a passenger cancellation keep them from their plans. Instead, they make an unannounced visit to Fay's (Rebecca Schull) house, where they help her get over the still-fresh death of her husband.

VIDEO and AUDIO

I'm fairly certain that the episode presentations here are identical to their appearances on earlier season set DVDs. Paramount may not be the best studio at bonus features or pricing, but their audio/video usually doesn't leave much to be desired. That's truer of movies than TV series, but the shows still look and sound quite good here, especially considering the age of the older ones. Of course, this isn't a disc you get to show off the picture and sound. But if you've ever bought a $1 DVD of vintage television in the public domain, then you'll be quite pleased by how much easier on the eyes and ears the content here is. Disappointingly, no subtitles whatsoever are provided, but closed captions are.

BONUS FEATURES, MENUS, PACKAGING and DESIGN

No designated bonus features are included here. While it would have been nice to get some kind of discussion of the holiday episode and its significance in sitcom production, the disc is quite filled to the brim already with 3 and a half hours of content.
And as even the best short featurette is likely to have less appeal than a popular TV show episode, the void of extras makes sense.

As does the lack of an insert, since the case back provides show and episode titles, synopses, and even original airdates.

It's worth mentioning that a couple of animated CBS holiday greetings spots fron the early 70's are scattered about. A one-minute one involves birds and a woodsman with a saw, while a 30-second one features an obviouly poverty striken girl's visit to Santa and her desire for his red coat ('tis better to give than receive). The prominent hiss of their soundtracks suggests they're old, but beyond that they're of indeterminate origin. Their inclusion is a very nice touch, but it would have been nicer with a few more similar promos being used instead of the same two being alternately repeated between each show change.

Though the static, silent menu is limited and fairly no-frills, it is cued by a very cool minute-long introduction that helps explain what this is with animation and the featured show's title logos.

Not everyone will see the value in Paramount's Holiday Treats DVD, but I think it's a pretty brilliant collection. The disc surveys forty years of TV sitcoms, provides eight distinctly different yet similar observations of Christmas, and entertains heartily doing both. I'd even encourage a buy by those who might already have two or more of the featured episodes in a DVD set. Note to studios: more DVDs like this, please. And let's not forget those great holiday variety show specials, too!",1226188800,,7672,5.101275917065391
3495271,4,B001BN4WJ0,"The DVD is called ""Holiday Treats"" and has been issued by CBS DVD and Paramount.  When I found this I thought it would be a good addition to a Christmas DVD that I have featuring episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, Jack Benny, Ozzie And Harriet, and Red Skelton.

That DVD came out a few years ago and I still see it in stores every year.  It is called ""Vintage Christmas Classics"", and was released by Alpha Video.  You can order it as well right here on Amazon at a great price.

However, the main gist of this article is about ""Holiday Treats"".  The title is appropriate as several of these Christmas episodes I have been hoping to have copies of for a long time.  There are 8 shows featured on this DVD.  In order, they are ""I Love Lucy"" (12-24-1956), ""The Honeymooners"" (12-24-1955), ""The Andy Griffith Show"" (12-19-1960), ""The Brady Bunch"" (12-19-1969), ""Taxi"" (12-12-1978), ""Family Ties"" (12-14-1983), ""Frasier"" (12-16-1993), and ""Wings"" (12-21-1990).

They are all great Christmas episodes, with ""Frasier"", ""Wings"" and ""Taxi"" probably being the two funniest, and ""The Brady Bunch"" being the most sentimental.  The picture quality is great although I haven't tried it out yet on the large HDTV television.  I have only run through the episodes on the computer so far.

Of course, since these shows are owned by Paramount and Viacom who are becoming notorious for issuing half seasons of television series at full season prices, and also for refusing to cough up money to pay for the rights to use original music on some shows (most recently changing the music to ""My Three Sons""), this DVD collection also has issues.  At least they tell you on the back that the music has been changed.

Well, it turns out that it affected only two series - ""Wings"" and ""Frasier"".  And because both episodes are so funny, and since I paid so little for them, I can live with it.

You can't go wrong if you add this title to your Christmas DVD collection.",1223856000,,1946,4.71301775147929

Then my Mom put it on her next year's list, so I bought another for her next year. All were on time & undamaged. I recommend it!",1518134400,,428,3.8202247191011236

8283633,4,B001BN4WJ0,"For those that enjoy television Christmas episodes, you'll likely love this set. I've always loved I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, The Brady Bunch, Family Ties, Frasier and Wings so these Christmas episodes were great. I didn't find The Honeymooners or Taxi Christmas episodes as heartwarming but to each their own. I'm glad to have found this set. Recommended watching!",1502582400,,375,5.163934426229508
