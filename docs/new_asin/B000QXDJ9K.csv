They seem to have made a child geared informational movie for just about every interest.  It is clear that a great deal of care went into making sure that these are done well and in a manor that will hold a child's interest while providing great education on the subject.  I recommend all of The Big Series movies to kids ages 3 to 7.",1223424000,,450,4.270588235294118
8197968,5,B000QXDJ9K,"I ordered this after my 5-year-old son fell in love with the Big Space Shuttle and the Big Aircraft Carrier.  We weren't disappointed with the Big Submarine, either--it's his new favorite.  Little Mammoth films are awesome!  I highly recommend them as an alternative to less engaging cartoons...or at least, as a once in a while change-up to some of the traditional animated children's shows.  These are perfectly geared and tailored to children, too.",1215216000,,451,5.136986301369863
8197969,5,B000QXDJ9K,"This video (in fact the series - we have the space shuttle one, too) is one of the best informational children's videos I've bought for my twin sons.  It accomplishes the difficult task of being highly informative and very engaging for young children at the same time.  I will be purchasing more videos in this series.",1198800000,2,318,4.660714285714286
