This is trash, the acting was horrible, and all of them not appealing, not to mention they were all anoying especially the guy with the sunglasses who keeps yelling his lines. I just wished the killer would have knocked him off first, not to mention the whole movie looked like some kid shot it with a camcorder...terrible just trash...stay away from this movie",1213315200,2,410,4.788732394366197

This is a disappointing B-movie with very little characterisation and story (most horrors don't anyhow, duh).  A group of teens take a trip and get high while an axe murder gets revenge via a spooky campfire story.  There's nothing new in the script or directing execution, and the whole premise feels totally generic.  It has a Blair Witch influence, but it never lives beyond its shadow.  The character John turns out to be particularly funny.  I don't know if the acting is just so awful, or that his stereotypical, mysoginist, bulligerent, jerk of a character makes him so caricaturely comical.  There's like three characters (John and the two dimwit females) who only care about partying.  There's the cautious and grownup one in Shannon who senses danger.  And there's her boyfriend Steve who is sensitive yet somewhat intelligent but conflicted between her and the other rowdies.  You have the creepy and bearded wilderness bear who warns the campers of danger.  And the older, wise 40ish year-old who is a set-up as the would be axe murderer.  The killer's look comes straight out of the Urban Legend wardrobe.  The only thing that saves this from getting zero stars (in addition to not being able to select it at Amazon) is the mildly pleasing and relentless conclusion.",1213315200,3,1297,4.949074074074074

8261251,3,B00166UFSO,"This B Movie isen't as bad as the other reviews claim it to be, having said that though it isen't exactly good either.  More or less, your average type of Horror flick.  The low budget aspect didn't bother me, cause it really dosen't show since almost the entire movie is filmed outdoors in the woods, as the title suggests.  The acting isen't something memorable in any way, but it gets the job done.  I would say the acting is average or slightly below average.
The plot, well, as it is usually the case with horror movies, there isen't much of a plot to begin with.  I mean its stereo-typical:  5 college students, 3 girls and 2 guys decided to go camping outdoors in a supposedly cool place, which is actually (you guessed it) in the middle of nowhere.  Of course there are the inevitable clichees that horror films always exhibit: Cell phones not working, since there no net support in a deserted forest.  And a psychopath killer roaming around the place where the students want to party.
For a low budget film this isen't bad, and its even somewhat entertaining.  The end was a slight surprise, but really nothing special.  So in the end, this is only recommendable to those that can't get enough of horror movies, and don't mind low budget films.",1260144000,3,1253,4.57847533632287
8261252,3,B00166UFSO,"In The Evil Woods, a group of teenagers decide to go on a little weekend getaway to the middle of absolute nowhere to do some camping. While setting around the campfire, they encounter a stranger who tells them the story of a deranged person named Walter whose spirit still lurks in the woods. A day passes and, one by one, they start being killed by someone with an axe. Who is doing the killing? Is it Walter? The Stranger the teenagers encounter? or the bearded guy who watches them all from a distance? To find out, you have to watch the whole movie.

Taken for what it is, a slasher movie, The Evil Woods succeeds. But, if you're looking for a catchy killer who's the likes of Jason or Michael Myers, you're not going to find it here. This is your everyday slasher movie that doesn't try too hard to rise above other movies of this kind, which is sad because this movie could've been good if it tried. That's probably why so many reviewers(here and elsewhere) find this movie a boring waste of time. Given, it is quite boring but I wouldn't call it a complete waste of time. The actors/actresses were up to making this movie believable and the filming of it was admirable...it's just the script seriously lacked anything inventive to make it stand out in a sea of other low-budget slasher films. How do you think movies like Friday the 13th made it big?

Anyways, The Evil Woods is decent...in my honest opinion. Yet, I wouldn't do more than rent this one at best. Not unless you can find a really, really cheap version in a bargain bin somewhere. Course, you'll probably go away feeling like everyone else does about this film..that you should've steered clear of this movie and rented something else.

I will have to hand it to Lionsgate, though, for giving low-budget horror like this a chance to be seen. I've seen some real gems this way. Some that should be seen by the masses.",1237334400,4,1888,4.514619883040936
8261253,2,B00166UFSO,"There are a few hurdles you'll need to overcome in order to watch this one. First, in the opening scene around a campfire you will be introduced to one of the most annoying actors/characters ever in a B-movie - the guy is so tediously happy and grinning that you almost wonder if he's stoned, as he's got that perpetual ""I'm sooo high, dude"" attitude (when, in fact, he's not high) that you'll just be begging for the killer to come around the campfire with an axe and relieve us all of the character. Next, you'll be treated to the longest opening credits that you will ever encounter... But, get past those two things, and you may find you enjoyed this one, if only compared to other B-Horror movies. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the aforementioned scenes that I started the movie with a negative outlook. I look forward to other reviews to see if it's just me, or if I was right on :)",1216684800,,893,4.385542168674699
8261254,1,B00166UFSO,"This movie is an awful excuse for a horror movie.  It's not even good enough to be considered a B movie, maybe a Z movie.  Do yourself a favor, if you want horror and action, skip this movie.",1214092800,5,191,4.0
