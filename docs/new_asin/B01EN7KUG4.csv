7738983,1,B01EN7KUG4,"This Blu-ray edition of Outlander is for the European market NOT the US. There is no mention of this anywhere in the description. This means the discs won't work on some forms of players, also the Sony authorization code that allows you to download the episodes to an IPad etc. also won't work in the US. Again there is NO mention of this. It cost approximately  $86.00 and cost me  $22.00 to return it. You can buy a US version for about  $30.00 that has all the extras and the Sony code.",1481760000,43,489,4.293478260869565
7738984,5,B01EN7KUG4,This is exactly what I wanted. All the deleated scenes and extras. It worked on our US standard Bluray.,1502150400,2,103,4.473684210526316
7738985,1,B01EN7KUG4,I returned it as I didn't see it was Blu-ray.  When I returned it I found out I would only get 1/2 of the return refund.  That is crazy and I am very disappointed! I lost over $27.,1501459200,5,180,3.710526315789474
7738986,1,B01EN7KUG4,I am very disappointed since I can't use it on my blue ray player......it will only work in the UK....it shouldn't even been on your web site...A big waste of $$$$$$! Not HAPPY!!!0,1501027200,9,180,4.484848484848484

7738989,4,B01EN7KUG4,"I loved the books so I have to watch the show.

On to Paris, with lots of lovely sets and amazing costumes, Claire and Jamie try to stop the Stuart rebellion from ever starting. While there are some differences from the books to the show that might annoy purists, most are done for moving the plot along quickly. You will love young Fergus! Most of the casting choices are spot on - mark me, you will hate the prince but love the actor! This season hasn't as much sex or gore as last season, which I was thankful for.

Highly recommend if you love the books.

As to the blurays themselves - a bit short on extra content was disappointing for the price. But the one thing that **really** made me angry is this is a 5 disc set shoved into a 2 disc holder. 2 discs are stacked on one side and 3 discs are stacked on the other. Very cheap packaging for such an expensive set. This made me drop one star on the rating.

The bluray edition works for me on my Samsung bluray player in the US.",1491177600,3,985,4.141361256544503
