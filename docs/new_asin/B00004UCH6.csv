7923864,5,B00004UCH6,"The world of shipwreck enthusiasts is not a big one (and it doesn't help that we use the words ""shipwreck"" and ""enthusiasts"" to describe ourselves), but to those elite few who wrap themselves up in the times and tragedies of early 20th century shipwrecks, ""Lost Liners"" should be the crown jewel of all documentaries.
I can remember when this aired on PBS when I was only in elementary school, and I was hooked like a moth to flame!  The documentary follows Dr. Robert Ballard as he charts his exploration of three of the most famous lost ocean liners ever.  This holy trinity of the wreck world is of course RMS Titanic, RMS Lusitania, and RMS Empress of Ireland.  It begins with some background on the ocean liner/immigration business of the early 20th century, then parses out the stories of Titanic and Lusitania with some survivor interviews and historian's perspectives.  But the last quarter of the program is spent solely on the little known Empress of Ireland, and Ballard's visit to her wreck site with the grandson of a couple who lost their lives on the ship.
The whole program goes along at a dignified, measured, but brusque pace as we go through the familiar story of the Titanic, the controversies of the Lusitania, and the almost forgotten Empress of Ireland.  What I love most about this documentary is the soundtrack by Michael Whalen (available for purchase or download by certain sellers).  From the haunting violin piece that starts the show, to the closing song ""Flower on the Sea"", the music strikes just the right note when trying to convey these liners, their times, and the emotions they stir in people even to this day.  It is both hauntingly sad and touching, much like the stories of these amazing liners and the man who has spent the better part of his professional life finding them.  You couldn't find a better documentary about these extraordinary ships!",1406764800,,1888,4.805555555555555
7923865,5,B00004UCH6,"The product description sums it up accurately, but I will add that the emotional depth of this programme is exceptional.  This tape accompanies the book, which is equally as great.  However, one might find the mechanical details of diving to the wrecks a bit pedestrian.  It is nice to see/feel the emotional aspect once they get there. The exception would be the discovery of Titanic's wreck site.  The interviews with John Maxtone-Graham are classic.  Any liner enthusiast should enjoy this, and a crime that it's not on DVD.",1287446400,,527,4.943181818181818
7923866,5,B00004UCH6,"Bob Ballard, who has been a PBS narrator and as a deep sea explorer, had a passion to find out where the lost liners were.  Twice, with crews, his search began with the Titantic and within this 15-year journey, he also discovered two lesser-known ship disasters, the Lusitania and the Empress of Ireland.  Ballard his own footage, that incorporates preparation for the expedition.

Aside from the most well-known story, The Titanic, which hit an iceberg, Ballard educates us about the Lusitania and the ship we rarely ever heard about, The Empress of Ireland which went down off the coast in Quebec in 1914.  The 120-minute production is written well, narrated well, and with a good musical score.  Actual film footage is used - from building ships, furnishings, and destruction.  He takes the viewer to actual locations on land and sea.  Interviews are conducted with survivors and/or their close families. This is about thousands of immigrants seeking work and children on board -  to the very wealthy.

The least-known disaster was the Empress of Ireland and one interview source is the author of ""14 Minutes"" - the length of time it took for this huge ship to go down in icy water.  One man joins the search;  his grandparents were among those who died.  Just five miles off the shore of Quebec, through miscommunication and fog, it collided with another.

In the shadows of the Titantic, theories remain about the Lusitania is that it was hit by torpedo from a German U-boat.  The Lusitania did carry weapons and was enroute to Britain.  The ship sank in 18 minutes.  Dead were 1,195.

To end this interesting documentary about ships and lives lost, is a beautiful song by Mary McLaughlin ""A Flower on the Sea"", written by Michael Whalen.  It is erie and haunting while appropro to the images that reappear.  .....This is excellent account of lost liners that included over 4,000 people lost to the cold or frigid icy waters of the sea.

7923867,5,B00004UCH6,"With all of the past hype surrounding the movie The Titanic, numerous networks aired tv documentaries and specials on this tragedy. Having watched more than my quota, I never would have chosen to watch this one,  had I not just stumbled upon it on PBS. With the help of Dr. Ballard, the  producers of this 2 hour documentary explore the stories and the remains of  the Titanic, the Empress of Ireland, the Lusitania, the Britannic, and the  Andrea Doria. This documentary transcends the typical history lesson.  Together with stunning footage, survivor accounts, and haunting music the  producers have crafted a chillingly fascinating production. I watched the  entire special in awe, not once leaving my seat. I've honestly never  purchased any sort of video documentary, but this one I feel will be a good  investment not only for myself, but for sharing with friends and family.  This is a must see!",963878400,5,902,4.953333333333333
