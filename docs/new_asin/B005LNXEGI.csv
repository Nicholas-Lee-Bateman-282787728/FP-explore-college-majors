4829489,4,B005LNXEGI,"If you ever felt like injecting yourself with an overload of the California Raisins, well, here's your chance. The dvd itself looks amazing (as does every release from Hen's Tooth)and is jam-packed with not only the Will Vinton shorts, but the entire animated series as well. The claymation shorts by Vinton and crew are awesome and fun to watch, but the animated series is pretty lame, though nice to have for nostalgia reasons. Most of the original commercials are also on the disc as bonus material.",1339804800,,502,4.848837209302325
4829490,2,B005LNXEGI,"The California Raisins specials and cartoon show are finally all on DVD in a two disc set. The first disc has the two claymation specials ""Meet the Raisins"" and Raisins: Sold Out"" along with four California Raisins commercials (including the ones featuring Ray Charles and Micheal Jackson). The second disc has all 13 episodes of the California Raisins animated Saturday morning cartoon series. I would have preferred that they put some of the cartoon episodes on the first disc, so as not to overload the second disc. The audio for the second disc is also not as good the the first disc. Watching with my surround sound system, the speaking voices in the cartoon series only come out of one speaker. This leads to the voices sounding hallow and too soft. Even on my regular tv, the background music is louder than the voice acting.  For those wondering, only the two specials have subtitles available.",1328659200,14,902,4.819354838709677
4829491,5,B005LNXEGI,I loved the Meet the Raisins.  So good to finally see this on dvd.  Also I am soooo excited about having the California Raisins Show on there as well.  I remember watching that show on saturday mornings.  I didn't realize it only lasted 13 episodes.  Very sad.  But at least now I have them all on dvd.,1324598400,7,302,4.2105263157894735
4829492,5,B005LNXEGI,"Remember this on TV and it is still good today, get for the kids to watch with the family
Very entertaining to this day",1324080000,4,119,4.0
4829493,3,B005LNXEGI,"It's crazy to see something like this on DVD, but I'm glad it's here.  Both the ""Raisins Sold Out"" and ""Meet the Raisins"" specials make this a worthwhile set to seek out.  That said, even with my brief time viewing it, there are some issues that make this a questionable purchase.

The ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" intro in ""Raisins Sold Out"" is cut short for some strange reason.  It doesn't appear to be a licensing issue, because the song plays in its entirety in ""Meet the Raisins"".  If I had to guess, I would think the version on the disc was edited for time constraints on syndicated/repeat broadcasts.  It's not a big deal, but it's an awkward transition compared to how the intro played out in the original.

Another strange omission is made with the end credits of ""Raisins Sold Out"".  The first part of the credits plays, but the second portion does not (which had some nice music to go with it).  Perhaps another ""for TV"" cut.

The bigger problem would be the general quality of the video presented.  Everything on here appears to be a VHS capture (UPDATE: actually ""1 inch master tapes"", see my update at the end), which is a shame but perhaps all that is available considering the source material.  They appear to be captured pretty well, and audio comes through nicely.

The cartoon episodes are on a dual layer DVD, so it's not such a big deal to have all 13 of these on one disc.  They still appear to be VHS captures (UPDATE: actually ""1 inch master tapes"", see my update at the end), but again that's probably not something they could avoid.  I can't imagine that keeping anything beyond tape masters for a failed cartoon was on anyone's priority list. :)

All of these problems are relatively minor, though, so if you're looking to relive the wrinkled rockers then you'll really dig this.  Too bad they were just a flash in the pan.

UPDATE 2: I got in contact with Hen's Tooth Video, who informed me everything was taken from ""1 inch master tapes"", not VHS tapes, I gave the VHS version too much credit.  These are a marked improvement upon direct comparison.

There's still issues with blurry portions (more during the cartoon series), shaky frames, and you can even see tracking lines near the top.  These were only intended for broadcast use as far as I know, so the quality is understandable.  It doesn't make it any less disappointing, but Hen's Tooth does appear to have done the best they could with what they were given.  And fortunately they appear to have presented everything as it was given with either very little or no tampering, which is awesome.

The missing portions described in my review were apparently that way in the masters provided, which might mean that the extended segments were only created for the VHS releases.  I did not see either special broadcasted on TV so I can't confirm that, but it seems likely.

I also wanted to throw in a quick comment about the four commercials presented.  It's a great bonus, just a shame that they were only able to provide four.  But still fun stuff all around.",1321488000,35,3044,4.607806691449814

4829515,5,B005LNXEGI,"This ""Mockumentary"" belongs up there with the likes of 'This is Spinal Tap', 'A Might Wind' and 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' but reminds you more of the Beatles' 'A Hard Days Night',  'the Beatles Anthology' special or a making the band series long before it became in the cable prime time line up.

The California Raisins, a Beatles-esque/Temptations like mo-town rock group, comprises some of the best R&B, Soultown and early Rock hits of the 50's, 60's and 70's  in their repertoire. The film follows the rise to fame story of the California Raisins as they go reminiscence about their discovery, hard times and finally hitting the big time to mega stardom.

Will Vinton's Claymation animation was not only was state of the art at the time of release; it's still rivaling current innovators like Aardman Animation and their 'Wallace and Gromit' and 'Shaun the Sheep' series. They were a powerhouse in Claymation Animation in th e80's and 90's and still exist today. (Ever see an M&M's commercial?)

This features is not just something for a throw back audience, but good entertainment for the whole family that holds up even today. With sly adult images, themes and references any audiophile would appreciate, but also enough jokes, funny imagery and style to keep the little ones enthralled.

The second entry in the series is no where near as strong as the original, as it's less a mockumentary than just a film about the Raisins. You could say it's an homage to standard fair films with musical groups like The Beatles' 'Help', 'Spice World' and any one of the films Elvis starred in. However, I doubt the creators had that much foresight and they just wanted to cash in on the success of the original made for TV film.

Bonus features are even included, with commercials galore and the full animated series!  A lot of care and thought went into this DVD release instead of just your standard cash grab.

This is fully a worth while investment just to say, ""How did they do that?!?"" while watching the top notch film production. I can honestly say, you'll wish the California Raisins were an actual musical band.",1450137600,,2175,4.825268817204301
