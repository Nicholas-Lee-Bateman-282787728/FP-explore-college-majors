7998099,5,B0000C0FN0,"For those who enjoy a good laugh mixed with a generous dose of romance, these movies will surely appeal to you.
This is Drew Barrymore at her best in ""Ever After"", a Cinderella twist done with all the enchantment of the Rennasaince. Barrymore plays Danielle, a strong yet sweet girl, beloved of her father (played by Jeroen Krabbe) and hated by her stepmother the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (suberb role by Angelica Houston) and her stepsister Marguerithe. Contrary to the original tale the other stepsister,Jacqueline, instead of being as wicked, is belittled by her mother and sister for being overweight, thus she takes Danielle's side when the time comes to get Prince Charming back (or in this case, Prince Henry).
The same could apply to ""Never Been Kissed"", although this time Prince Charming comes in the form of Michael Vartan (Alias). This is the tale of a journalist who, in search for a great story so she could prove once and for all that she has talent, enrolls in her old high school as a part of the research.  Beloved of the Math Club and hated by the A-Popular Girls, Josie ""Grossy"" Geller has to put her fears aside in order to succeed. But she does not count on Sam Coulson (played by Vartan), the cute literature teacher that will make her feel whata real kiss is all about.
Again, you want fun, a good laugh, and yes, a good cry, these movies are one of the best choices.",1084924800,7,1393,4.594377510040161
