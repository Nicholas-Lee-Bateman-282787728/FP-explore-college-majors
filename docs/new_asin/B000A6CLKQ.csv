2363753,5,B000A6CLKQ,"My seven-year-old daughter and I have watched the Season 1 and Season 2 DVDs so often that we both practically know them by heart.  We both LOVE the show.  It's so amazing to find something like this, that's totally appropriate for children and totally hilarious for both children AND adults.  I can't wait for the Season 3 DVD to come out...  I really hope the show continues for at least another season and that they do make another movie.",1122163200,5,441,4.544303797468355
2363754,5,B000A6CLKQ,"IT's not what it looks like, I mean. I'am sorry. Spongebob

looks like me almost. He had a same teeth like I'am.

I thought there coming on november. The third seasons is coming

earlier. Spongebob, say hello all your freinds for me.

see you soon.",1120953600,2,248,4.444444444444445
2363755,5,B000A6CLKQ,"Nickelodeon continues to churn out collections of spongebob that keep repeating the same shows over and over again. I guess they want to make as much money as possible. Im just glad that the full season 3 is coming finally. Its tough not to buy the individual sets when they come out but its worth the wait when you can have all of them at once. I just hope that Nick begins to release other classic cartoon shows like Rugrats, Rocko's Modern Life, and Doug on dvd through seasons. They are missing out on making a lot more money than they are by just sitting on these and releasing maybe one episode through compilation a year. Season three was my favorite and spongebob continues to get funnier through each season. This has one of my favorite episodes Spongebob meets the Strangler in which sb hires the strangler to guard sb from the strangler. Good stuff. These are the episodes that will be on the third collection:

When it came to how Amazon handled my order... The tracked shipping had several delays and the DVD case was crushed at the top right corner, but I could order a new DVD case off eBay. The discs don't seem to be in bad shape, but it does skip every now and then and it's worrying me. I really hope this skipping issue doesn't last forever.

Next, at least in subbing to Hulu Plus and Amazon, they simply do not offer this season for streaming. So, for us, this season was worth purchasing on dvd. My kids love Spongebob, and I admittedly get a kick out of it. We have been enjoying season 3 quite a bit. If you don't have a way to stream the episodes with a subscription to varying providers, definitely seasons 1-4 are worth having. If you have Amazon Prime, you can stream seasons 1,2,4,7 and 8 I believe.",1429747200,,578,4.361111111111111

I don't know how anyone could go without ever hearing of this show....but if you haven't its quite enjoyable to watch. There is however nothing educational about it. Its just made to make you laugh at the stupidity of Spongebob, who lives in a pineapple under the sea and his best friend Patrick, a starfish who lives under a rock. It's entertaining....but you might want to throw something educational in there right after so the stupidity doesn't move onto your kids lol (just joking...but maybe not).",1399852800,,628,4.718181818181818

I like that the segments are less than 15 minutes long. The kids are mostly satisfied with just a segment or two. The adults are a different story...we can watch for an hour or two!,1398643200,,319,4.161290322580645

2364964,5,B000A6CLKQ,"Later seasons did not live up to the sly comedy of earlier ones. ""Just One Bite,"" ""Idiot Box,"" and "" Rock-a-bye Bivalve"" never get old. I know there are many haters out there who think Spongebob was/is nothing but a merchandising ploy, but there are lines in these episodes that should go down in animated comedy history.",1394064000,,321,4.649122807017544

Sometimes I'll sit and watch it with them and his adventures are always entertaining.  As an adult you can find some suggestive content but nothing horribly bad.  Perhaps the kids see it different and simply entertaining but it's also fun for all ages.  Never a dull moment in Bikini Bottom.",1393286400,,433,4.430379746835443

2364986,5,B000A6CLKQ,"As season 2 contains the phenom, Band Geeks, season 3 contains a lot of phenomenal episodes. Due to production of the first movie, the schedule of new SpongeBob episodes slowed down a lot in '03 and '04, just like season 9 recently did for production of the second movie in 2013 and 2014. This revered season features Plankton switching lives with Mr. Krabs, Mystery the seahorse, the Krusty Krab as a 5-star restaurant in Squidward's futile attempt to impress Squiliam, SpongeBob trying to get in the Salty Spitoon, Patchy showing what the Stone Age was like including the ancient ancestors of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward (and those of Gary and Mr. Krabs too); SpongeBob trying way too hard to throw a house party, Squidward driving SpongeBob crazy after Mr. Krabs' first dime ""went missing"", The Krusty Krab's own training video which thankfully stops when revealing the Krabby Patty secret formula, as well as its famous commercial that goes to SpongeBob's head, Plankton's family joins together to steal the secret formula, the Lost episode where SpongeBob tries to fly, only to do wacky favors for everyone in town, and SpongeBob's famous day with the Tattletale Strangler! There's only a few bonus features in this set, one of which is the original pilot episode ""Help Wanted""! SpongeBob was said to end after this season and the first movie, but his popularity proved so great, even with the ""gay community"", despite the fact NO character on SpongeBob is like that, season 4 was well underway when season 3 concluded & the first movie debuted in theatres in 2004. But season 4 didn't debut until 2 months AFTER the movie came to VHS & DVD in March 2005. What bugs me about this set, along with season 2's Christmas special, is some of the footage of the specials was left out because of commercial-break references. The First 100 Episodes set is the same way with all these specials. Speaking of edited footage, Just One Bite is presented in both sets in its edited version seen on Nick since 2002. The deleted scene of Squidward's gasoline trap remains deleted, for being called too violent after 9/11 getting everyone's goose. Luckily, it can be seen on YouTube, but sadly not on DVD. Other than these exclusions, season 3 is a must-own for longtime fans of SpongeBob, whether in its bulky packaging or its new single case! Bring on the universally-beloved nautical nonsense that is SpongeBob SquarePants!",1392854400,6,2420,4.904878048780488

2365208,5,B000A6CLKQ,"As I wrote in a previous review, I was turned onto SpongeBob by my girlfriend's 7 year-old daughter! Like I wrote in my previous review (for SpongeBob's Season 7 DVD Set) it was about 2.5 years ago. I bought the film, then a few of the 'grab-bag' DVDs w/ random episodes. Now, I'm getting the Complete Seasons-only through Amazon, by the way! The prices cannot be beat, @ least as compared to stores & REPUTABLE sites! Season 3 was delivered yesterday (I ordered it on Sunday, 8/4/13). Whenever I order, I like to get the One Day Shipping-it's worth it & not expensive! Season 3 has some of my most beloved episodes-i.e., ""SpongeBob Meets The Strangler"", ""Krab-Borg""(the 1st that I popped in), ""Krusty Krab Training Video""(which is 1 of THE most popular eps. ever, via the 'Pop-Ups'-I'll get to that later), ""The Camping Episode"", ""Club SpongeBob"", ""Krabby Land"", & I could go on & on. I bought Seasons 7,8,& now 3! I pick them by which 1's have the episodes that I love the most. Season 3 has some awesome Bonus Features! 1st, there's 'Pop-Ups' on select episodes. As the ep. progresses, Trivia Facts will pop-up (hence the name) on your screen, facts about that episode in particular, or just rare facts about the show & the making of. There's also a ""How To Draw SpongeBob & The Main Characters"". It's a .5 hour long demo for kids to teach them to draw the characters, which I think is GREAT & unique! Also, the Pilot Episode ""Help Wanted"", which is NOT on the Season 1 DVD BoxSet (for whatever reason), is included. I've seen it on Nick, but it's cool to have here as a Bonus. As always the picture is great, & as I mentioned in my other SB Season 7 review, the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo Surround is much better than 2.0 on DVDs of films & other TV shows. Why? No idea, but there IS a HUGE difference. The 3-DVD Set is packaged in the 'Tray-Stack' style, all in a 'Keep Case'. 1 note: MY  Season 3 DVD Cover-Art is different from what is pictured on amazon.com. I noticed that the copyright date on MY copy is 2012, but the 3rd Season was released on DVD in 2005. I guess I have a 2nd Edition, as opposed to a 1st. That bums me out a bit, as a collector of film/TV DVDs, I ALWAYS try to get the 1st Editions (hence why, when a movie or TV Season is released that I want, I get it on it's release day!)!Other than that, a stellar product. Amazon is the best!",1375833600,,2360,4.339366515837104

2365404,5,B000A6CLKQ,"Oh..... SpongeBob.  Your cheerful optimism and indomitable spirit makes me so happy.  I know you're supposed to be corny and nerdy, aloof and annoyingly sun-shiny.  But I can't help how you see the positive in everything!

Seasons 1,2, and 3 are definitely my favorite episodes.  I feel that after season 3, the writing became much less true to the characters.  A similar thing happened to The Simpsons, when after years of success writing stories that were zaney but also heartwarming and true to real-life experiences for most somewhat dysfunctional families.... the show enjoyed so much success that quality writing didn't matter so much anymore and they could have the characters do whatever they wanted regardless of whether it was true to their nature.  So long as it got a laugh.

This, I think is what happened to SpongeBob.  The later seasons have a few gems, but I like the first three seasons because the show wasn't such a runaway success yet, and the stories were much more carefully and cleverly written.  Really witty at some times, actually!  I love how Patrick is really just a kid character.... who gets excited and who has hissy fits.  He's really not dumb, he's just a kid and he occasionally says really bright and insightful things too the way a child does.  In later seasons..... they just write him as really dumb or really violent.  And that's not as sophisticated or insightful.  Yep, I'll stick with the early seasons.

2365459,3,B000A6CLKQ,"Season 1 and 2 of Spongebob were brilliant but in season 3 you could see that the cast and crew were beginning to run out of steam...that's only natural,it happens to every T.V show somewhere in it's lifetime. Perhaps when we see a show that's really good we forget that the people responsible for it are actually human and we think of them as supermen so when the show falls apart we get really really upset with them,but it's not their fault so much after all. They're working according to a deadline and art isn't supposed to be rushed. How would you cope under that kind of pressure? Some memorable episodes include, ""The Algae's Always Greener"",""Nasty Patty"",""No Weenies Allowed"",""Krab Borg"" and ""Wet Painters"". There are also some 'hark back' episodes where you feel like you're watching season 1 and season 2 Spongebob but there are definitely a few forgettable ones which you probably won't remember quickly after you've watched them. You'll laugh when you see Spongebob and patrick try to raise a scallop by themselves and also when they try to sell chocolate to people in bikini bottom. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy appear in two of their episodes and they're not half bad. In their last one,""Mermaid Man And Barnacle Boy V"", there is a legendary feel to it which is somewhat appropriate and is a welcome feature. The T.V specials really do deliver,you won't be displeased with them,with ""Party Pooper Pants"" probably being the best one of the three. As for the musical side of things,the show has always produced amazing musical numbers,who could forget the finale in ""Band Geeks"" from season 2? In the third season,the guys are still strong,the score is well done and there is some singing to enjoy. It's a different kind of Spongebob compared to the previous seasons but ultimately you won't regret buying it. What's nice is that you also get the pilot episode of the show,which (awkwardly enough) is better than some of the episodes you'll find in this box set! If you're a spongebob fan you'll enjoy it,if you're new to the little guy,you'll enjoy it too.",1343088000,3,2070,4.8011204481792715

2365461,3,B000A6CLKQ,"coming off of the first two seasons of this show, the third season leaves much to be desired. there are some great episodes like Wet Painters and Chocolate with Nuts. but then there are some really bad ones to go with it, like Rock a Bye Bi-Valve and any thing with the live action Patchy the Pirate in it.

Seasons one and two were undeniably great, but the quality of the storylines and animation in three were at their peak.  (Season four, unfortunately, marked the beginning of the end.)

Most notable episodes:
""Just One Bite"" - Spongebob coaxes Squidward to try a Krabby patty.
""The Bully"" - Flats, a new student at the boating school, threatens to kick Spongebob's butt.
""As Seen on TV"" - Spongebob gets a big head after appearing in a Krusty Krab commercial; features the song ""Striped Sweater.""
""No Weenies Allowed"" - Quite possibly the best written episode of the whole series.
""Krusty Krab Training Video"" - Self-explanatory; gotta love that soundtrack.
""The Great Snail Race"" - Spongebob as a harsh coach.
""Mid-Life Crustacean"" - The fact that the words ""debauchery"" and ""panty raid"" were used at all, let alone in the same episode, was a real hoot.
""The Camping Episode"" - Features ""The Campfire Song Song""

As an added bonus, this set also features the pilot episode where Spongebob first gets hired at the Krusty Krab, featuring Tiny Tim's ""Livin' in the Sunlight.""",1219536000,4,1172,4.959183673469388
2365478,4,B000A6CLKQ,"I purchased this one for my kids. SpongeBob is unusual, if not unique, being one of the few kids' cartoons that also holds some appeal for adults, at least those young-at-heart. The humor, while generally juvenile, still displays enough sophistication to make watching it with the kids bearable.

Until season 4, that is. After season 3, while not all bad, it definitely becomes hit-or-miss, especially with the voice acting for SpongeBob himself, who becomes rather one-dimensional, perpetually even maniacally happy at almost all times. I'm not sure what happened there, but he lost any subtle shading of emotion, despite the fact that I think it's the same voice actor.

Anyhow, season 3 is good from beginning to end, all classic episodes. Despite the fact that SpongeBob appears frequently on Nickelodeon, I'd still rather let my kids get their SpongeBob fix from the DVD, without the incessant marketing they would be bombarded with if I let them watch it on TV.",1214870400,2,968,5.04375

""Just One Bite""

""Idiot Box""

""Doing Time""

""Wet Painters"" (a personal favorite)

""Krusty Krab Training Video""

""The Camping Episode""

""Pranks a Lot""

Anywhyey as someone has said in there reviews some dummy snipped out ""Just One"" bit of the episiode ""Just One Bite"" which is my personal favorite spongebob episiode because of the music as well as the humor.

2365528,4,B000A6CLKQ,"I always seem to know when it comes to laughter, nobody knowss that better than what kids absolutely like. Currently, they enjoy cartoons like Powerpuff Girls, Jimmy Neutron, and The Fairly Oddparents. Yet, out of all the looney antics, nobody has been able to corner that market like Spongebob Squarepants. It has really been one of those very few cartoons series that parents and kids can laugh alike. That has been very true for Nickelodeon the past few years. Yet, there just has been too many different DVD's of Spongebob the past few years. But, putting a simple collection all in one can usually be one in a million most of the time. Now, that humor is possible the third time around.

Spongebob Squarepants: The Complete Third Season is a reflection of some of the very best moments in this pure cartoon delight. Each episode does deliver most of the time as a continuous guilty pleasure. This DVD does deliver with a whole lot of sponge-lovin' with Spongebob, Patrick and even the unlikeable, but somehow interesting Squidward. The collection includes most of my favorite episodes including the goofy winter antics of The Snowball effect: where Spongebob and Patrick's snowball fight, puts Squidward in the middle, and also hopefully into having some fun, Chocolate With Nuts: in which Spongebob and Patrick become chocolate salesman, but turning out to lose more to which they hopefully gain into selling sweet pleasures, Spongebob B.C. also known as UGH!: that portraits Spongebob and company into what they would be like into the prehistorical times, and looney bouts over fire and a giant-sized prehistoric Gary to name a few. The episodes has been restored very easily, and leaves little to nothing edited for viewers of all ages alike.

All in all, if anybody hasn't seen Spongebob Squarepants on Nickelodeon, or any of the countless DVD's released, then this collection of Spongebob is worth the wait in money. The Complete Third Season absolutely does deliver those under the sea antics quite well, and unlike current DVD collections portraiting cartoons like The Simpsons, or Ren & Stimpy, nothing is edited out. This is truly a must have for the sponge or starfish in all of us.

2365529,5,B000A6CLKQ,"Finally season 3 is out!  I've played the tartar sauce out of the first two seasons and it is nice to have some new episodes on DVD even though most of these I've seen numerous times on television.  This DVD set is much more compact than the other two with streamline cases but does not sacrifice the cool artwork.  I like the rustic design of the case covers with the woodwork of the Krusty Krab.  It also takes up far less room than the bulky season 1 and 2 sets. And, for those disappointed with not getting HELP WANTED (the pilot episode) with season 1, it is offered here as a bonus on disc 3.  Here are the season 3 episodes:

Disc 1:  The Algae's Always Greener:  Plankton uses his advanced technological creation to trade lives with Mr. Krabs (complete with shirts and pants) and discovers that being the father of Pearl and owning a business that employs SpongeBob may not be all it's cracked up to be.

SpongeBob on Duty:  White stuff on SpongeBob's nose makes Larry the Lobster mistake him for a fellow lifeguard.  One problem:  SpongeBob can't swim (????) Anyone else find something strange about this episode?

Club SpongeBob:  I've seen this show so many times on TV, I'm already sick of it.  Anyway, SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick find themselves lost in the middle of nowhere with only a magic conch shell to guide them.

My Pretty Seahorse:  SB befriends a seahorse who threatens his job by eating everything in sight at the Krusty Krab.

Just One Bite:  One of my favorites!  Squidward is the only one who can resist a krabby patty, until he tastes one.  He then becomes addicted and even fantasizes about marrying one!  Hilarious!

The Bully:  Flats the Flounder is the new student and decides to kick SB's butt.

Nasty Patty:  Mrs. Krabs and SB concoct the most vile krabby patty for who they think is a fake health inspector.  Reminds me of a Fawlty Towers ep.

Idiot Box: Squidward is skeptical that SB and Patrick can turn an ordinary cardboard box into an entertainment center through their imaginations.

Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy IV:  SB gets hold of MM's utility belt and chaos ensues.  ""Oh boy!  A squidward action figure!""

Doing Time:  One of the craziest episodes.  SB creates a wave of destruction (and cranberry juice) during his boating lesson and Mrs. Puff is arrested.  SB and Patrick set out to break her out of the pen.

Snowball Effect:  Squidward takes a game of snowball war a bit too seriously.

One Krab's Trash:  Mr. Krabs sells SB a soda drinking hat and then is desperate to get it back when he finds out how much it's worth (""AAAA!  A floating shopping list!"").

As Seen on TV: SB appears in a Krusty Krab commercial for a split second and believes he is Mr. Celebrity.

Can You Spare a Dime?: After being accused of stealing, Squidward quits his job and ends up penniless and on the streets.  SB takes him in and Squid becomes accustomed with being waited on.  This ep is the only time I've seen SB really lose it.

No Weenies Allowed:  Another of my favorites.  SB tries to gain entrance into the Salty Spitoon where only the toughest sea creatures can join.

Squilliam Returns:  Squidward pretends he owns a five-star restaurant (a re-vamped Krusty Krab) to impress his successful rival.

Disc 2:

Krab Borg: After watching a scary robot movie, SB is convinced Mr. Krabs is a robot.

Rock-A-Bye Bi-Valve:  SB and Patrick take care of an orphaned baby scallop.  Patrick proves he's not the most devoted of fathers.

Wet Painters:  SB and Patrick must paint the inside of Mr. Krab's house without getting any paint on his wall hangings, particularly his first dollar.  Excellent Patrick ep. Patrick and the candy machine is one of the funniest SB scenes ever.

Krusty Krab Training Video:  What every Krusty Krab new employee must see.  Will the secret krabby patty formula be revealed?

SponeBob's House Party:  SB gets a party planning kit and has every detail scheduled.  Luckily for his party guests, he gets locked out of his house.

Chocolate With Nuts:  Classic!  SB and Patrick try to be entrepreneurs by selling chocolate bars door-to-door.  The old ""fishwife"" and her mother are hilarious.

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy V:  Barnacleboy is tired of being treated like a kid and joins the dark side.  Patrick, Sandy, SB, and Squid become not-so-super heroes.

New Student Starfish:  Patrick comes to boating class with SB and gets SB in trouble.

Clams: Mr. Krabs celebrates earning his millionth dollar by taking his loyal crew clam fishing.

SpongeBob B.C.:  Prehistoric Spongegar, Patar, and Squog discover fire.  Double ep.

The Great Snail Race:  SB forces Gary into a snail race with Squid's pedigree snail Snelly.

Mid-Life Crustacean:  ""Like an old has-been, Look at you old man, you've got multiple chins `cause you're old.""  Mr. Krabs yearns to feel young again. SB and Patrick may help him feel too young.

Born Again Krabs: A near-death experience causes Mr. Krabs to promise the Flying Dutchman he will no longer be a cheapskate or risk eternity in Davy Jones' locker.

I Had an Accident:  SB break his derriere and decides to spend all his time indoors.  Funny until it gets to that stupid gorilla bit.

Disc3:

Krabby Land:  Mr. Krabs opens a crummy playground to lure children and their money to his restaurant.

The camping Episode: SB and Patrick go on a daring camping trip right outside their houses.  Squidward joins and is attacked by a sea bear.

Missing Identity:  SB loses his nametag and tries to get dim-witted Patrick to hep him re-trace his steps.

Plankton's Army:  One of my favorites.  Plankton gets his relatives (who are not quite at the same intellectual level) to force Mr. Krabs to give him the krabby patty formula.  The ingredients may be too shocking for him to handle.

Lost Episode (The Sponge Who Could Fly): Double ep where SB dreams of flying with the jelly fish.  Patchy the Pirate makes his always annoying appearance.

SpongeBob Meets the Strangler:  SB has the Tattletale Strangler arrested for littering and the Strangler vows revenge.

Pranks A Lot: Patrick and SB buy invisible spray paint at the gag shop (they passed on the fake and real vomit) and start playing practical jokes.",1128297600,55,6192,4.7516525023607175

The episodes on Season 3 rock!  I really just think everyone should watch Spongebob Squarepants because while I know it's a ""cultish,"" fad type show, it is for a reason.  Spongebob is a smartly written, witty, creative, gorgeously produced program.  There is a reason it is laugh out loud funny.  So I'm glad to that this season is finally released on DVD.

If you ask me, the humor in this show gets more and more bizarre, which is exactly why it becomes more appealling to me.  I was a big SNICK fan, and for those of you who know what SNICK is, you know to appreciate shows like Round House, Ren & Stimpy, Rocko's Modern Life, and other such classics.  These shows all had a very distinctive sense of humor to them which may not have made sense to the general public, but made people like me appreciate them all the more.  Spongebob has become more and more like the older nicktoons the longer it has been on the air, which is why I feel as though this will be their best season yet.  Not to mention, it includes the pilot episode!

When the first season of Spongebob came out, I bought it right away.  I was so excited to have it on DVD because I wanted a more permanent copy of the pilot episode, ""Help Wanted,"" in which Spongebob gets his job.  Well, the first season didn't contain the pilot episode.  So, needless to say, I've been waiting for it to be released on DVD.  I think any Spongebob fan who has not seen the pilot episode should purchase this DVD Set for that specific reason.
