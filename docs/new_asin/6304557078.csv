7874663,5,6304557078,"If you're not ready to roll out the bucks for the complete fourvolume set of HOLLYWOOD RHYTHM, this is the one to buy first. The mainreason is for the first short in this volume -- ""Symphony inBlack."" This marvelous short features Duke Ellington at the pianocomposing a new work.  Intercut between those scenes are vignettesrepresenting the different movenents of the piece.  One of whichfeatures a young (and uncredited) Billie Holiday as the scorned woman. Another features the provocative dancing of (also uncredited) Earl""Snake Hips"" Tucker.  Contemporary music video directorscould learn a lot from this piece with its stylish use of black &white photography and wonderful art direction.
Another reason tobuy this video is to see Bessie Smith's only film appearance in theshort ""St. Louis Blues."" Her power as a vocalist is evidentin this piece, which is also about a woman abandoned by a lover. Jimmy Morcedai is cold-blooded in another rare film appearance.  Hisdancing is not half-bad either.
The other shorts don't quite rise upto the level of these two shorts.  Some also feature some verystereotypical images, which were typical of this period.  However,don't let that stop you from buying this video.  ""Symphony inBlack"" alone is worth the price.  It is an absolute masterpiece",978739200,11,1289,5.284313725490196
