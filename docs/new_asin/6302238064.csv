453665,2,6302238064,"I'm reviewing primarily for the DVD production quality (not performance). Great performance but picture/audio quality comparable to VHS. Doesn't utilise any of the enhancements offered on DVD. The picture quality has not been remastered nor the sound -it is Dolby Stereo! A real disappointment, what a wasted opportunity. DG could have really showcased opera on DVD. If you must, buy the video instead (you'll get 90% of the audio/video quality). I for one will not be wasting any more money on DG's DVDs. I hope they get their act together soon -I'm sure I'm not the only classical music fan who has spent thousands on home theater just to play movies.",986169600,32,653,4.891891891891892
453666,5,6302238064,Domingo is a little too old for the role as a young captain but his voice is still good.  Millo's Aida is not what I expected since I was told that she was great before I bought this DVD.  I like Zajick's Amneris and Burchuladze's Ramfis the most in the whole play because of their incredible voices.  In general it's a very good performance.,984528000,12,342,4.3125
453667,5,6302238064,"I have written a number of reviews for Amazon - as in line with Shirley Bassey and Scooby Doo - This as Good as it gets!!
I have seen a number of Aida's but would have sold my soul to have see this one live at the Met.  However, I watched Dolora Zajick's Amneris at Covent Garden and she was as wonderful as her portryal here - at the House I shouted myself hoarse at her portrayal - mind you I did too when I watched this DVD.
Domingo is perfect as Radames and Aprile Millo has done nothing better.  What an emotional scene it is when Amonasro (Sherrill Milnes) holds his chained hands up in in passion at the climax of Act II.
The sound and picture are perfect - the production is exemplary - this is the best Aida you are likely to see or hear.  I emplore you to buy it.  You really will not regret it.

453669,2,6302238064,"While the sets are detailed and impressive, the production lacks ""atmosphere"". everything seems as it should but there is a clinical quality about it which makes it all a bit dull. Add to that an overly melodramatic performance that border on being comical.

453741,5,6302238064,"I still remember the Met's ridiculous production with poor Marilyn Horne and everybody else having to walk sidewise.  Ms Horne could hardly contain her laughter.  No such mistakes here.  A Met production as only the Met can do them--simply awesome, a total visual treat.  Luckily, also a total vocal treat.  I was horrified to find out there are only two DVD's of Ms. Millo's trail-blazing career, this one and a ""Ballo"" with Pavarotti.  She cannot even be found on CD's.  And yet, she is the best Aida I have heard since Price.  Zejik (whom I just so as Azucena in a Trovatore DVD) is one of the most memorable Amneris I have heard as well (though my favorite is still Bumbry).

453773,5,6302238064,"This is really good.  From a 1988 live performance, directed a bit statically by Sonja Frisell, it is very well-played and paced, and, on the whole very well sung.  The video direction by Brian Large is good, though it does at times accentuate the rather un-kinetic quality of the direction, but these are small matters when so much is right here.  Levine gets a sound from the orchestra that is both refined and expressive, and his musical pacing of the scenes seems just right.  The only reservation I have about the singing came towards the end of Act 3, after a splendid ""O patria mia"" from Aprile Millo -- things went off the boil a bit with the entrance of Sherrill Milnes as Amonasro, who sounded rusty and uneven, although he looked great.  Domingo sounded a bit tight when he entered -- at ""Pur ti riveggo"" -- and even Millo lacked a bit of luster as the scene came to an end.  Both Millo and Domingo were back on form splendidly in the final scene, which Levine paced just beautifully and in which both singers did some very lovely soft singing --and in which Large solved, simply and effectively, the visual challenges that a filming of the scene poses.  In the previous scene, Act 4, Scene 1, Domingo and Dolora Zajick, as Amneris, sang with a passion and intensity that perfectly set up the different character of the final scene.  Zajick's performance and singing, in the year of her Met debut, were impressively strong throughout -- powerful or tender as needed -- and her ovation was well-deserved.  Ramfis was impressively taken, if you could get past the weird hat, by Paata Burchuladze.

Domingo, at 47 when the recording was done, sounded much better than he did six years earlier with Abbado.  Aprile Millo, at 30, was really outstanding in all the big moments and most of the small ones.  The voice has power, delicacy, and steadiness, and if it wasn't memorably distinctive, as, say Tebaldi's or Price's is, that is no criticism of her performance and one can understand how she went on to become a favorite for years at the Met.  Her recordings of ""Luisa Miller"" (on CD) and ""Ballo"" (with Pavarotti, on DVD) are cherishable too.  An all-round fine job!",1455494400,2,2176,4.662303664921466
453774,5,6302238064,"This recording is the epitome of perfection. I sincerely hope that the Met never gets rid of this production. Levine's conducting, as always, is spot-on, Domingo's singing is powerful and sublime. April Millo's voice is gorgeous and her ""O patria mia"" is perfectly executed, which is reflected in the rapturous ovations she receives, both at the end of the aria and at the final curtain calls. Zajick plays Amneris beautifully; she's evil and manipulative, but your heart ends up breaking for her in the final act. Wonderful cast and thrilling production.

Leontyne's live performance from 1985 has not been released yet so this one will suffice for now, however, the production which is still utilized at the Metropolitan opera, is my personal favorite.  I personally think all of the main characters from Aprile Millo, Dolora Zajick, Placido Domingo and even a mature Sherrill Milnes among all the others including the off-stage voice of Margaret Jane Wray with James Levine in the pit, make this a must have.

453856,2,6302238064,"This is a good performance to watch for someone who doesn't know the opera at all, doesn't know great singing or conducting at all, and who will be appreciative of its considerable visual qualities.
To begin and end with Levine's tempos are all wrong. The opening prelude sets the tone. It is taken much too fast [if you have other performances, please compare] which conveys a very business like mood to the piece. This feeling pervades most of the performance because of Levine's pacing. Second, to whip up excitement Levine overplays dynamic contrast. Yes, this is the grandest of grand operas, but there's a difference between grand and explosive. Levine goes for explosive.
Second, Domingo does not turn in a good performance. In 'celeste Aida' he ends every phrase with a kind of sforzando that sounds like he is pushing himself tp use his last ounce of breath; and in the close of the aria he can't hold the the phrase long enough, decides to stop short, and then improvises with a repeat of the phrase in a quieter and lower pitch.
Don't get me wrong. I think both Levine and Domingo are usually great and among my favorite performers. What went wrong here one can only guess.
As for the rest of the cast, they are simply not on as high as the best of the past, except perhaps for Milnes.
To give credit where it is due, the MET orchestra plays at an extraordinarily good level for an opera house band.
Visually I must admit the performance scores high. So, for someone who doesn't have any ideas about how well the opera can be sung and played, this video is a good introduction to the wonderful music and to the spectacle. However, if you have a great performance of the past playing in your memory (my head is filled with the Milanov, Bjorling performance conducted by Perlea, an old mono recording now on CD that will make you forget that it isn't stereo or digital or video) you won't like this one.
I've had this video for a number of years and played it, I suppose, again last night. Now I know why I haven't listened to/watched it in quite a long time.",1358035200,5,2068,4.517333333333333

453859,1,6302238064,"Eurotrash is generally applied as a term  by US commentators to criticise adversely European Regietheater productions, We in Europe think of Eurotrash as signifying vulgarity, over blown, ostentatious show. As such this Aida is a prime example of Eurotrash. What is Aida about? What does it have to say to us NOW?  Verdi's seriousness of intent is lost in a sea of literalness, ridiculousness and vulgarity. Opera for those who believe opera is a show, without meaning for the 21st Century. This great work deserves the seriousness of attention we apply to Shakespeare.  This is a totally empty spectacle with posturing puppets (who can sing,albeit well!)",1326326400,3,655,5.160377358490566

453861,5,6302238064,This DVD is as close to making you feel like you are at the Met than any operatic DVD I own.  What majesty and scenery.  A must buy for you opera collection.,1301788800,2,157,3.875
453862,4,6302238064,"First of all, this is the first opera I have seen on DVD and the first one I have seen in years. I've seen some live performances on stage and several operas on VHS tapes.

Levine was a pleasure to watch directing this orchestra. His facial expression contained so much drama that you could have fun just watching him.

Now we come to the principles. Here it's getting hard. Aida is such a famous opera that one possibly has expectations that are too high. While all the three principals were good, none can be described as superb. I liked Aprile Millo as Aida. Beautiful voice and acting was not bad. Placido Domingo was a decent Radames. Good but again not smashing. Dolora Zajick as Amneris was good and almost interesting but I don't think she was ""in the zone"" that night. It's just my impression though. I would prefer a bit more subtle Amneris. Overall I liked all three of the leads. (Irrelevant observation: Zajick's Azucena on another Met DVD is fantastic.)

The only one I did not like at all was Paata Burchuladze who played Ramphis. Too much wah-wah singing for my taste. Good thing his was not a major part.

The real unexpected delight in this opera was Sherrill Milnes. His Amonasro was just perfect, the way Amonasro should be. He is not only a great singer but also a superb actor, with a tremendous stage presence. He stole the show every time he appeared on the stage. Just watch the scene when the prisoners march before the king and proud Amonasro bows to the king! It was thrilling. And his later scene with Aida was equally impressive: a passionate patriot but also a loving father, torn between two emotions. He was definitely the best of them all. Too bad we did not have enough of him in this production. For me he really brought character and dimension to this role and made you wish he had bigger part in the story.

The staging was marvelously done. The difficult Act II with all the masses of people and the triumphal march were done very well, certainly better than in most other productions.

So I think it is a very good Aida. Perhaps not the best (is there even such a thing?) but definitely a very solid reliable and enjoyable performance. It was done in a way how I pretty much imagine Aida should be done.",1292803200,3,2243,4.498771498771498
453883,5,6302238064,"I don't have much experience with opera nor am I any expert, so I cannot comment on anything technical. What I CAN say is that i was totally mesmerized by the performance. All three principle characters are just PERFECT for the parts. Domingo is my favorite singer of all time and all genders, so no need to say anything. Millo helped me appreciate soprano voice because I had been a little annoyed by sopranos. My prejudice about sopranos was that their voices sounded too shrill. Listening to Millo singing Aida cured my prejudice and now I have some favorite singers. Zijick is divine. Especially whenever I listen to her sing and act in Act 4 scene 1, I become totally hypnotized, speechless, and tears come down. She is breathtaking in that scene. I don't know about other things but singing is the best, especially for the 3 main characters.",1271376000,4,847,4.691275167785235

The cast was excellent and those pianissimos by Aprile Millo moved me beyond words.... This production was back in the old days: I  believe 1989.  Placido was tremendous as he always is. I have more time in my schedule now and will watch this production again and again... I have always loved opera even when it was not popular with my peers... but that is okay... We are all different anyway...  As a young adolescent my paternal grandfather took me to this opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Rina Telli had the starring role.... It was an evening of Verdi's masterpiece ""Aida"" and sharing this special time with  my grandfather who I loved and still miss.  We had orchestra  seats too!  This was a monumental event for me.

Many years ago, I saw this opera in London when I was on leave from the Army. At that performance, I thought the grand march would never end and that the actors walked off stage and returned a few minutes later to continue the march. When I came to that part of this version, I was naturally curious as to how it would be accomplished. I was not disappointed as the Met did a super job in its presentation. Now, I can't wait to see the Live in HD Met version which provided backstage work by the crew in changing the sets, for which I would have paid anything to be able to sit and observe it all from backstage.

Since seeing the backstage work, I have an appreciation of the enormous sets for this production.",1262822400,2,821,4.262820512820513
453887,3,6302238064,"""Celeste Aida"" is the big aria.  Any self-respecting tenor would use this aria to stir the audience into frenzy, as intended by Verdi.  When Domingo hit the big high note, he decided to cut it short and sat down.  And sat down he did.  He still got his usual ovation at the Met.  If it was at Parma, he would have been boo'ed off the stage, Domingo or not. I have to agree with three of the reviewers that this was a sub-par performance by Domingo.  Seven years earlier, in 1982, he did not cheat in his Deutsche Grammophon recording (available on CD). He was Domingo.

One key performer can ruin an opera in one key aria!  Millo, Milnes, and Zajick were superb.

Domingo has the last laugh, of course.  He lasted half a century by cheating here and there, whereas many of his colleagues lasted only half as long.",1261699200,5,813,4.36

Here we get the Cecil B. DeMille level of stage show and I for one do not ask for anything more. Just what the doctor ordered.",1257552000,2,442,4.337349397590361

For the last several months, I've been getting together with some opera-loving friends now and then to watch an opera DVD. While I was entertained by the first several spectacles, I didn't really get into them like a true opera lover because I was distracted by the weirdnesses of opera... bizarre stories (Magic Flute), singers mismatched to their parts or to each other, cultural anomalies. (In Lakme, Indians and Englishmen singing French was weird enough, but the Hindu priest behaving un-Hindu-like really threw me. I was told that in an opera the passion and beauty are what matters. But I couldn't get past a Hindu calling people infidels.)

Then we watched this DVD of Aida. Never mind that Egyptians and Ethiopians sing Italian and the herione wears blackface. By the end of Act 2 I was paralyzed with conflicted emotions. I finally got the true opera experience. I think this transformation was caused partly by the greatness of the music, but also by this production's awesome stage sets and the perfection of all the performers' singing, acting and interacting.

This performance of Aida is no exception.  I loved everything about it but I was simply blown away by the incredible voice of Aprile Millo.  I honestly don't think I have ever heard any role in any opera sung to more perfection than this and her acting was superb as well.

Millo in blackface is absolutely ridiculous, and while she may be the ""best Verdi soprano of the last 25 years"" she is no Price or Tebaldi. On the bright side Zajick is VERY good both vocally and in character.
The videography is truly horrendous. Either the characters are so far away that they are indistinguishable or so close and shot from such an odd angle that it looks ludicrous. The sound is simple stereo (an in places in need of serious remastering).

Placido Domingo as Radames is top notch although past his prime vocally.  In Act 1, Celeste Aida sounded quite flat as compared to the Pavorati version.  I must say that I prefer Franco Corelli's performance (see Art Of Singing DVD) much better but I cannot find a Corelli Aida.

Dolora Zaijick as Amneris is superb rendering her mezzo just beautifully.

Aprile Millo as Aida is very good and yes she had ebon makeup to validate her Egyptian slave persona.  However, compare her 'O patria mia' with that of Leontyne Price in the 'Art of Singing'  DVD.  There is no comparison.  Ms. Price sounds just top notch.  All in all Ms. Millo's performance is very good.

I am, however, a regular consumer of opera.  I attend the opera a couple of times a year and at the best of them, I am transported to a different place, lose all sense of self, time and place.  -  A few weeks ago I was at the Met and heard Flemming sing Violetta, for example and was nearly moved to tears.

This production is disappointing to me because it has the feel of having been shot by a camcorder from the back of the room.  Having seen Terfel and Flemming's DVD of Don Giovanni, I know it can be done much, much better.  The problem here is that the set is enormous and the people are small.  The camera takes too many distance shots where you can't see the singers and so it feels tinny.
If I want opera for the musical quality alone, I will buy a CD.  For a DVD, I want film-like production values and camera work.  This DVD is a let down.",1196726400,13,986,4.062176165803109
453917,4,6302238064,"The first thing that impresses the viewer are the stupendous sets. It is as though the designer, Giani Quaranta, has thrown down a gauntlet to the performers - ""Match this!"". He clearly conveys the impression of a great civilization that seems to be on the wane. The giant friezes (if that is the correct term) are hugely impressive, but they are beginning to crumble. The frescoes in Amneris' room are lovely, but the paint is coming off. I was also impressed by the King's costumes. I checked up and the headresses, including the double crown as well as the regalia - the crook and the flail - are absolutely correct. I only wonder why Pharoah did not have his false beard? Would it have made singing harder?

I confess to a certain fascination with Amneris, and Dolora Zajick gets better and better in this role as the opera goes on. In the end you have the feeling that old Ramfis is going to have a rough ride when she becomes queen.

I have seen too many Aidas where you wonder WHY Radames prefers her to Amneris. Here, thanks to Ms. Millo's exquisite looks (it is a pity she is not black in real life, it suits her) and marvellous singing (particularly the pianissimos) the plot seems half way reasonable.

The only negative, and I say this with sadness because I admire him, is the performance of Sherrill Milnes. He is no longer in good voice and his acting is not upto par. He comes across as far too old for a warrior king and he is very stiff in certain parts.

Domingo is Domingo - looks, voice and acting are all perfect.

I have one quibble with the video and that is the superimposition of Amneris on Aida and Radames in the finale. It would have been better to present the double stage from a distance. Also, Amneris' final ""pace"" is swallowed up by applause, which is a pity. I would have expected better of the Met's audience.",1189728000,11,1845,4.446745562130178

Placido did not discourage. Aida has a beautiful voice, but I guess beautiful voices along with beautiful faces and carriage befitting a princess are nonexistent in the opera world? (Watching too many Hollywood flicks?) For a romantic Aida's countenance was the wee disappointment.  I think that even a different hairdo could have helped.

453920,5,6302238064,"Of all the 'Aida' productions I've witnessed, this version is my favorite.  If you are searching for your first 'Aida' it should be this Metropolitan Opera production with its balance of great and good singers, and its grandiose Egyptian backdrops of sandstone, bronze, linen and gold.  It has one of the better triumphal marches, too.  No elephants (except for a few tusks), but scads of soldiers, dancers, Ethiopian prisoners, leopard skins, and gaily caparisoned horses.

Aprile Millo's Aida sings well, especially her celestial pianissimos, but she is a cold princess-slave.  She seems to be perpetually annoyed--perhaps because Amneris got the best costumes---but her tomb scene with Placido Domingo is to die for.  It is only when she has to crank up the volume that she sounds a bit pinched.

Dolora Zajick's Amneris is why you need to hear this production.  She is a luscious, spoiled, intensely feminine, young Pharaoh's daughter.  She is also a true Verdian mezzo with a voice as rich and seductive as her appearance.  This is one of those 'Aidas' where the Pharaoh's daughter almost steals the show.

Paata Burchuladze sings a Slavic, wa-wa trombone of a Ramfis, lisping, loud, and satisfactorily menacing at the fore of his priestly chorus.  I really enjoyed the stentorian booming of the priests, thundering away at the lower levels of 'Ritorna Vincitor,' demanding the deaths of the Ethiopian prisoners, and snarling out their 'tradditores' beneath Amneris's frenzied pleading in the judgement scene.

Placidio Domingo is a soldierly Radams and his 'Celeste Aida' is sung with a silken vigor that doesn't require the interpolated, often-bleated high B flat at its climax.  His nobility does make it difficult to believe his sudden decision to desert his soldiers and run away with Aida in the Nile scene, but make no mistake, this is a great tenor in his prime. If you don't shed a tear during 'O Terra Addio' maybe you should be listening to something other than opera.

Greek bass, Dimitri Kavrakos is a suitably dignified pharaoh with slightly less wa-wa than his priestly colleague, but with enough volume to be heard in the crowd scenes.

Sherrill Milnes is a ferocious, glowering Amonasro, although his baritone has definitely begun to show signs of dryness.  His scene with Aida is dramatic rather than beautifully sung.

There is one fairly serious problem with this production--I've played it on two different machines, so it isn't my equipment:  I can barely hear the male chorus at the beginning of the Temple of Vulcan scene.  The priestess and the women's chorus come through fine, but no matter how much I crank the volume, the men's unaccompanied chorus is nothing but a distant muttering.

Even so, I think you'll love this 'Aida', right down to the last 'pace' of Amneris, quietly grieving above the tomb.",1129075200,90,2836,5.042918454935623
453921,5,6302238064,"I cannot imagine a better ""Aida"" than this Met production/performance from 1991. The sets and costumes spectacularly reflect the grandeur of Ancient Eqypt, and James Levine is in top form, leading the ever-fabulous Met orchestra and a cast that, if not pitch-perfect, is never less than first-rate.

Admittedly, neither Domingo nor Milnes is at their best here.  By this time Milnes had lost a lot of the richness in tone and shading that made him one of the best bass/baritones of his generation; he pretty much wields his voice like a blunt instrument, getting the job done, but not much more.  And while this isn't an out-and-out off-night for Domingo, it isn't one of his best, either.  The performance seems to be taking more effort than usual, particularly the high notes. (His modulation of the final whatever-it-is at the end of ""Celeste Aida"" is pretty much a metaphor for his entire performance.)

The women are, in a word, spectacular.  I've seen Aprille Millo at the Met a number of times and cannot remember being so blown away.  Perhaps by the time I saw her live she was in her decline.  In any event, we're lucky that this DVD has captured what I think is one of the finest operatic performances I've ever seen.  Truly.  Millo's vocal control is astounding (the pianossimos are breathtaking) and her acting no less so (without ever toppling over the fine line into melodrama).  She's nothing short of a star here, well-deserving of the hugh ovation she receives from the Met audience.  And I love Zajick's interpretation of Amneris.  On first glance she's the regal, jealous bitch we've seen in every other ""Aida.""  But this superb artist takes us deeper into the character.  In modern terms, she's the awkward, dumpy math geek who can't understand why the star-athlete prefers the homecoming queen.  Heartbreaking.",1115510400,26,1831,4.915309446254072
453922,5,6302238064,"A stunning presentation.

This is the 1989 version of Verdi's Aida performed before a live audience at the Met  in New York. It stars Placido Domingo as Radames, Dolora Zajick as Amneris and Aprile Millo as Aida. The orchestra is conducted by James Levine; the video under the direction of Brian Large. The sets were spectacular, immense; the costumes were well done and fairly represented the Egyptian era they were trying to portray.

Placido was at his prime during this presentation, his voice vibrant and powerful. His portrayal of Radames perfectly balanced Millo's Aida, whose sweet voice was able to hold and control those exquisite soft high notes in her aria's and also in her duets with Domingo. Zajick (as Amneris) had some incredible aria's in the second half of this production.

In addition to the singing, the acting was extremely well done; powerful, sincere and passionate. Emotional enough to have the audience giving enthusiastic applause and cheering almost before some of the acts ended; making the show wait until they stopped.

This opera was deemed fit to win an Emmy in 1989 for ""Outstanding Classical Program in the Preforming Arts"". It's not hard to understand why. With this cast and this setting, it's an Aida for the ages! Highly recommended",1107475200,13,1272,5.009478672985782

Domingo is always musically and dramatically convincing but produces some very tight top B flats in Celeste Aida. Listen to Pavarotti (video with Maazel) or Carreras (EMI recording with Karajan) to hear how the role should be sung. Waving arms around with the odd meaningful gesture does not cover up a vocally flawed performance.",1107216000,16,535,4.944444444444445

A 58-year-old Plcido Domingo is simply unconvincing as a young soldier. Aprile Millo, as a well-fed version of the Ethiopian slave girl (in ridiculous black face), Aida, defies the costumers' best attempts to provide a waist line. And Dolora Zaijick mirrors a middle-aged matron more than the Egyptian princess Amneris.
A fine performance by the ballet troup only draws attention to age and fitness disparities. Like an emperor, the Metropolitan Opera stands as a respected authority. Perhaps this is the impetus behind overenthusiastic curtain calls which prolong the end of each act, but the emperor has no clothes - or at least they need ironing.
These are the type of miscastings which turn neophytes off to the idea of opera. Huge fans of these performers who can suspend disbelief may well be pleased, but those craving contextually appropriate performances will find this one age inappropriate.",1094515200,15,1164,5.164021164021164

Verdi wrote Aida to help celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal, so he wrote a Spectacle, and it is as a Spectacle that it should be judged, not by the number of blockbuster arias. You will not find a greater Spectacle in all opera than what is in Act 2. Every member of the cast, the chorus, the ballet dancers, are perfect, and James Levine does his usual fine conducting of the orchestra.

Millo likely was not that warmed up in the beginning but by the time of Scene 2  ""Che veggo...pugnai"" I had to sit up realising that she must be somebody as she was very prominent among Milnes & Domingo. Her solo in Act 3 ""Qui Ramamis...' further confirmed what I was suspecting. Apparently the whole cast, orchestra and audience were listening. And after that, the whole Met audience went nuts. The final curtain calls can only be described as an emotional tribute to Millo and she reciprocated. Really unfortunate that she does not have too many recordings/dvd likely on health/voice ground.

En el papel titular, la soprano APRILLE MILLO hace una extraordinaria version vocal de la esclava etope, a la altura de las mas grandes encarnaciones del papel. Su actuacion es recompensada por el publico con fuertes ovaciones tras cada una de sus arias, y con una ovacion final que la emociona profundamente. Una Aida maravillosa.
PLCIDO DOMINGO es un interprete muy inteligente, y, aunque esa noche no estaba todo lo bien que acostumbra en el registro agudo, sabe salvar los escollos de la parte de Radames por la zona alta con inteligencia, y en la central y baja ofrece, como siempre, una voz muy bella, acompaada de una gran entrega escenica.
Un lujo es tener a DOLORA ZAJICK para Amneris, ya que dota al personaje de un gran relieve, y vocalmente esta excepcional, demostrando esa gran artista que hay en ella.
SHERILL MILNES, pese a las ovaciones que recibe, ya era mayor aqui, y su voz ya no esta en su mejor momento, lo que desluce algo su prestacion como Amonasro.
PAATA BURDZULADZE como Ramfis y DIMITRI KARAVAKOS como el Rey de Egipto rinden a un gran nivel. Discreto el 'Mensajero' y bien la Sacerdotisa.
JAMES LEVINE sabe llevar con brio a los conjuntos estables del Met, consiguiendo de su lectura de la obra un gran resultado.
La produccion es visualmente imponente, tanto por la fastuosa escenografia como por la iluminacion y el movimiento de actores; aunque se le pueden reprochar algunos vestidos (especialmente los de Aida y Amneris, que no lucen nada a las dos divas) y lo inadecuado de la coreografia del segundo acto.
En resumen, una 'Aida' que dejara contento a todo aficcionado, ya que reune un reparto de calidad y una produccion vistosa. Para disfrutar viendo una opera poco mas se puede pedir que lo que aqui se da.",1075334400,2,1900,4.778115501519757

That said, this 1989 production has all of the elements that historically make the Metropolitan Opera one of the world's best.  The sets and costumes are opulent, the staging is impressive and the dancers and chorus are essential in bringing what is essentially a series of musical tableaux to life. And the singing is pure Met. The Met is all about ""La Voce"" and Domingo, Millo, and  Zajick are all voice. Aprile Millo is incredibly believable as Aida, bringing firey passion, sublime musicality and vocal inspiration to this difficult spinto role. Dolora Zajick is a formidable Amneris, who uses her strong mezzo voice and musical sensitivity to bring the essence of Pharoah's impassioned daughter into the hearts of the audience. Placido Domingo is simply himself. He sings with articulation, power and intensity, and that's just fine. There are a few ""oops"" that keep this DVD from being perfect  such as awkward angles, subtitles covering up a performer now and then, and the overall static nature of the production. But it is still wonderful viewing, and a wonderful artifact of the Levine era Met. Decades from now it will serve as a tangible reminder of some of the great voices of the late 20thC.

453960,3,6302238064,"This is quite a disappointment:
1) filmed in 1989, Domingo had well past his prime, hugely different from his own Manon Lescaur , or his Hofmannn with The Royal Opera. It's not just his voice, but also the way he sang: there isn't any freshness to say the least. He nonetheless deserves 4 stars, if not 5;
2) Domingo voice at this age doesn't, nor does any other voice here,  mix well with Aprile's ( I'm not comparing her with Schwarzkopf or even with Nuccia Focile);
3) stage settings are unnecessarily dull. For the first part the chorus singers were just human properties standing there virtually without any action/movement even when they sang. A sharp contrast to Careras' Carmen with Baltsa;
4) photography is poor, not much better than B/W. Very often singer(s) were about 1/10 of the size of the screen, or else close-ups of the singer to cover only half his chest, without his hands and then shot at an awkward angle etc. Lighting is so poor that often the texture and colour of some of the facial expressions, costumes and properties are indistinguishable.
5) More is desrirable of the balance between the orchestra with the vocal. I miss Vienna Philharmonic, say those under the baton of Furtwangler e.g. Don Giovanni.
6) Dolora sang beautifully but the Egyptian king was not too gratifying...
Even though Aida is one of my favourite operas, I don't feel like going back to it, at least not for quite sometime.",1052697600,18,1422,4.733870967741935

Domingo's Rhadames is robust and masculine, and his performance is well acted and heartfelt, and Aprile Millo, beautiful in ebon makeup and with her marvelous profile, looks every inch the Ethiopian princess taken slave; her sound is rich, full of emotion, and with wonderful pianissimos. For me, her ""O patria mia"" is the highlight of this opera, and she shines in every scene she is in.
I have a special fondness for Act One, Scene two, the ""Temple of Vulcan"", with ""Nume, custode e vindice"" one of the loveliest of the opera's melodies. Here it gets a stately treatment, and though it does not come close to the musical power of the Domingo/Ghiaurov/Muti CD, it is still good listening. Act Two, Scene Two, the Victory March, has some well behaved horses, a simple but pleasant ballet choreographed by Rodney Griffin with attractive dancers, and the entrance of the great Sherrill Milnes. Though well past his prime vocally, he looks fabulous, and is believable as the conquered King Amonasro. The cast is rounded out by Dolora Zajick as Amneris, Dimitri Kavrakos as the Egyptian King, and Paata Burchuladze as Ramfis.
Though the stage direction is on occasion a little static, and the singing not always quite up to par, this is one of Verdi's grandest operas, and makes for very enjoyable viewing, and every minute spent with Aprile, is time well spent.

Despite of everything, despite of terribly fatty Pavarotti hardly moves on the stage, despite of overloaded stage with huge pieces of noising decorations moved by ""slaves"" over all performance, despite of everything I like it more. Domingo is not on his best, his voice in many places on the edge his abilities, he breath too loud, in some places he just almost shout etc. He moves too much, he is looking in the ""uniform"" like Turkish policeman on the beach. He doesn't look strong, he doesn't sound strong, and he is not convincing. I think he got this role this only by his name: there were a lot of singers who had been able to sing much better. Sorry, it is Aida, it must be the perfect Italian ""belle canto"", but it is not.
Pavarotti does make his Radomes perfect ""belle canto""!
The stage decorations make me think that somebody has tried to cover the empty places with something. Everything is flat, no deepness like with Alla Scala, and no fantasy.
Sorry, the ladies sound very nice, but forgive me again I don't think that such Aida would be the lovely women that I will fall in love so much that would betray to my ""Patria"". Sorry but Aida must be performed by young and attractive women, except for the case it is production was labeled ""for senior audience"" but it isn't.

I have been searching for a soprano who could do pianissimos like Tebaldi to no avail - UNTIL now. Millo is ravishing! The end of ""Oh Patria Mia.."" is just what I had in mind. You really have to hear this!! And ""..Padre a costoro schiava non sono.."" will tear (double entendre) you up!! The entire cast is far above average!

One can see huge decorations, splendid, brilliant second act and of course amazing performance buy Met's chorus and orchestra. What is knew on this tape is two female performers, who now are very well known but in 1980 not much was known about them: Aprile Millo, Aida, she is really fantastic, I can say that I've never seen such a convincing performance of Aida from the times of Price and Caballe, she is the Aida of last two decades. What about Dolora Zaijick? This dramatic mezzo-soprano is totally outstanding, her singing is so great, so dramatic, full of passion, people can not stop shouting 'brava, brava' at the end of the judgement scene... really wonderfull, makes you cry. Her voice gives you impression of both Fiorenzza Cossotto and Elena Obraztsova, two in one. I think she is the best mezzo of modern opera.
The weakeness of this night is Domingo's singing, every time he sings, you want to hear more, his voice is so sweet, so passionate, but it won't make you cry. For me if performer doesn't make you cry, it means that something is not quite correct. Maybe that night Domingo's voice was not in the best condition.
In Total, I give to the performance 5 stars, and I should say that it is must have, I saw it on VHS too, but on DVD it is much better.",1004486400,23,1450,4.538167938931298
454002,5,6302238064,"This is the best production with best cast I've seen either on video or in person.  Granted, Price was the best Aida but the cast was not always up to her standard and not alot of good video of her available.  Millo really shocked me!  I certainly didn't expect her to sing or act this well.  Thought she was truly exceptional!  Domingo, Zajick, and Milnes were also spectacular.  Delora owns her role and Domingo makes Pavarotti pale in comparison.  The sets and costumes are the best I've seen both in person and on video.  One strange thing, the colors on the costumes are so much brighter in person than on the LD or tape. I saw it at The Met with a really inferior cast except for Delora who was the only one who could sing and did she ever!  The production still knocked me out! This is the best video of this opera and I highly recommend it!  It's truly grand opera!",996537600,20,873,4.300613496932515
454003,5,6302238064,"Now this is grand opera in every sence of the word. Placido Domingo was so good that I almost fell down on the floor. This again proves to me that he is the best tenor of the last 30 years. His tone, understanding of the text, phrasing, feeling for the part are something I haven't heard before (with the possible exception of Jon Vickers). Hearing him sing in the Nile Scene with Aprile Millo about leaving his home land where he grew up and grown to love was so heartfelt and beautiful.
And equally good was Millo. Her Aida was so sensitive. She really made the character sweet and commanding. Her soft high notes are also so beautiful. She has the best of what makes a great Aida. Dolora Zajick was also extremely good. She had the right chest notes and high notes to make Amneris menacing, touching and someone to feel for. At the end we not only feel for the convicted couple, but also for Amneris.
It was only Sherrill Milnes that was not quite as good as the others. His acting is equally exemplary as the others, but the notes often are delivered with a little unsteadyness (he is past his prime). I don't mind a little unsteadyness, though, so he was good enough for me. He was magnificent on the Trovatore set with Metha, Price and Domingo, but this is 15 years later.
Levine's conducting is well balanced and very sensitive. The production was exctremely good. It's good to see an opera with sets that are so good as this and authentic too. The sound was good and so was the picture. The uncompressed linear PCM sound really made it sound like we were there. I am glad that the producers of opera on DVD present the uncompressed sound, since the compressed Dolby Digital 2 track sound sounds so terrible.
This is a great performance for all Aida fans and Domingo fans.",994636800,21,1779,4.460122699386503
454004,5,6302238064,"Oh my gosh what a spectical with nothing to fault. Aida cannot be better performed. For what room there is on a stage utterly unbelievabale and with live horses as well. 20 or so years ago I saw a performance at the Hartford Civic Center with a lot of animals Elephants, Tigers etc. etc. This is a star studded cast in depth. The costumes , effects and staging are without par. The visual and aural senses keep one glued to their seat. All in all well done. The singing is first rate Domingo is in great form but it would be meaningless without all the other principals. In total all were outstanding contributing to a synergy unrivaled  anywhere or in any House. The final scene and the final words of the Princess, her face superimposed to the right of the tomb scene sent goose bumps cascading through by being. Magnificent.",993427200,6,827,4.513333333333334
454005,5,6302238064,"Dolora Zajick's ""Amneris"", and Aprille Millo's ""Aida"" are a stunning combination.  I teach music to elementary students, and my 5th graders upon watching Act IV of ""Aida"" asked if we could watch the entire opera.  Anything that could have 5th grade boys asking to watch opera has got to have something going for it!!!  Domingo is too old (facially) for the role of Radames, but vocally still strong.  Watching Sherrill Milnes (Amanasro) is always a treat.  He is the consummate professional.  Staging, sets and acting are carried out to a ""T"".  It is unlikely that a better video recording of ""Aida"" is out there!!!

7824499,3,6302238064,"Fantastic sets and orchestra, a good production. However, it's not great in terms of imaginative directing. Fantastic set and excellent singers, yes. A park-and-bark Triumphal March scene gets to be a bore in too many productions. The Met still has yet to have filmed the perfect cast, for every significant role, in one singular opera. Too bad the Met has long been withholding the farewell performance of Leontyne Price from DVD sales. Online Met streaming has long been the only way to see that production. I can't show this to a mixed-race college class today because the Ethiopian characters have on black makeup instead of being actual black singers.",1504483200,,656,5.027522935779817
