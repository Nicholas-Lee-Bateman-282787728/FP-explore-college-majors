8563027,3,B00B5UBF2Q,"La Forza del Destino has always been one of my favorites in the Verdi canon. Starting with Grandmother's RCA Victor 78 of E. Caruso and A. Scotti singing the Act 3 duet ""Solenne in quest'ora"". I've seen a dozen or more productions over the years both in America (Lyric-Chicago, Met-New York) and Europe (Rome, Verona, Naples, London). I had five versions on LP and now have four on DVD and one on Blu-ray. Needless to say the quality has varied considerably among these productions and recordings but I would say that the present Blu-ray disc is the dullest of them all. My first staged version was Renata Tebaldi and Richard Tucker (mid 50s)that brought down the house. The next was Eileen Farrell and Carlo Bergonzi that was equally successful. And then there were the many times at the Met when the reining ultra Prima Donna was Zinka Milanov and after she finished performing ""Pace, pace mio dio"" the noise from the audience was louder than anything you'd have heard at Yankee Stadium after a winning home run. More recently I've seen Montserrat Caballe', Jose Carreras, Leontyn Price, Leo Nucci as Don Carlo de Vargas etc. etc. I was terribly disappointed  in the opening sections of the present recording until Leonara (Urmana) arrives at the Monastery (the only set in this production I liked). My interest picked up and held for all places and times where she performed. But for the rest of the times-no. Violeta Urmana has the makings of a grand old-style spinto Leonora without a hint of bel-canto. The kind of voice we need for Trovatores, Forzas, Ernanis; the old-fashioned high Italian romantic style. The Don Alvaro of Marcello Giordani is adequate; he even reminded me of Bergonzi, but he is not there yet. The Don Carlo de Vardas of Carlo Guelfi was a keen disappointment. He sounded sour and is no actor. He rushes in swearing to kill Don Alvaro but he is looking at the conductor and not at Don Alvaro. The Preziosilla of Julia Gertseva was silly; no verve or elan. She should sparkle and be a coquette. Julia acted as if presiding at a Sunday School picnic. The Padre Guardano of Scandiuzzi was well sung but he does not have the rich depth of voice of a Ghiaurov or Christoff. The orchestral score that Verdi has provided is exciting, excessive and unabashedly Italian romantic. Here they sound like they are playing a German requiem. Only Urmana was first class.
Yes, I know I sound like the ""old opera critic"" complaining as M. Gleeson, the previous reviewer described. So be it, I stand guilty as charged. But Forza is near and dear to me. I want it done with respect.
n.b. In old productions of this opera at the denouement after Leonora has been killed by her dying brother, Don Alvaro runs off and jumps off a cliff to his death. Presently he is left on stage to mourn with Padre Guardiano. Verdi was never happy with the ending of the opera even after the new revision of 1869 by Ghislanzoni. cf Budden, Julian.

8563028,5,B00B5UBF2Q,"OK, let's admit that Forza is a troublesome opera, and it is so on several levels. First, it's hard to cast these days because current trends favor bel canto and Baroque techniques, not true Verdian singing. Second, as William Berger (""Verdi With A Vengeance"") puts it, it is "". .. a work that seems to be defiantly thumbing its nose at the conventions of believeable story telling"". My one and only experience with Forza onstage, before seeing this disc was a Met performance with Tucker and Price, and an RCA CD set with those singers, with Merrill, Tozzi and Flagello has been my ""go to"" version when I needed a Forza fix.

But one must be wary of ""...bitter old opera people who complain that all singers today are lousy"". (Berger) While I am not bitter, I do find myself recalling the performances of Tebaldi, Price, Correlli and Bergonzi with great fondness, and one who is time-locked in this mind set should pass on this DVD. Because I wanted a video of Forza, with all the technical whistles and bells, such as DTS surround, I purchased this and am very glad that I did.

This is a very good performance of the opera, and is, I believe uncut. The pricipal singers do extremely well, although, as is the case with most live performances, there is an occasional ""oops!"" And that awful ""Rataplan"" chorus is included, sad to say.

Violeta Urmana is a convincing Leonora, both vocally and dramatically. There's no getting around the fact that she's a large woman, but that kind of becomes background in light of the intensity she brings to the role. When she hits a forte high note , there's no doubt that it resonates at the back of the house (Think Birgit Nillson). She also floats some of those melting pianissimi that Verdi lovers relish so much.

Marcello Giordani is an excellent Alvaro. While the first few moments following his entrance are a bit tentative, he quickly gets well into the role. Vocally and dramtically, he's the real deal here.

Carlo Guelfi is also good in his portrayal of Carlo, the vengeful brother. While his top does not have quite the ping of other baritones, he is vocally secure and dramtically believeable. He is a working partner with Giordani in the wonderful three baritone tenor duets that are done so splendidly here.

Although Roberto Scandiuzzi (Guardiano) makes one long for someone like Ferrucio Furlanetto for depth and resonance, he still does a commendable job, vocally and dramatically. Bruno De Simone breathes some believeable bureaucratic fussiness into the role of Melitone, a part that I usually find boring.

Zubin Mehta conducts the orchestra and chorus of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino with authority, and refreshingly, the latter do very well in interacting with each other to bring some dramatic credibility to the choruses. Staging is traditional, saints be praised!.

Disc quality is first rate with clear, crisp picture and glorious sound in the DTS surround mode. No Asian subtitles here, but the usual Western alternatives are available.

This disc is a re-issue of a release of this 2007 performance on TDK. Apparently, Art Haus is doing this, since wonderful performances of Elisir and Fille du Regiment have made the transition. What this means to the frugal, gentle reader, is that the original TDK version is available at much cheaper pricing than this version, at least as of this writing.

While this (occasionally) ""bitter old opera lover"" fondly recalls past glories, your humble reviewer is well aware that just as there was ""only one"" Leontyne Price or Carlo Bergonzi, there is ""only one"" Violeta Urman or Marcello Giordani. Singer are unique, and each one, past or present, had/has his/her strengths and weaknesses. I am delighted to have this performance to enjoy and can reccomend it to prospective buyers without reservation. Except for the ""Rataplan"" chorus at the end of Act III which I have always hated. And still do!",1368576000,12,3903,4.8910741301059
