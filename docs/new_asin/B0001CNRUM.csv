8010628,2,B0001CNRUM,"Don't let the fancy package fool you.  I should have known better - the price was so low I thought I'd found a bargain.  Unfortunately the prints of both these Hope movies on this particular DVD are mediocre at best.  The biggest disappointment was with ""Brunette"" - using a public domain release from CNF (I think I recall that correctly), it doesn't even have the original Paramount logo at the beginning.  The print is fuzzy, the sound fair.  ""Bali"" fares a little better, but you could do better elsewhere.  Pay the right price, get the better quality.  I have yet to see a pristine copy of ""My Favorite Brunette"" - if anyone knows of one, let me know!  Once again, buyer beware!",1208736000,2,683,4.540983606557377
