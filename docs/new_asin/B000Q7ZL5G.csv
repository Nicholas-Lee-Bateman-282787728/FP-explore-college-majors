Saw this originally on a NETFLIX DVD rental and it stuck in my head. It drags... the pacing is horrible... the special effects are blah - but the 'mood' and feel is really interesting - enough so that I had to buy it when I saw it for sale on AMAZON. The title and the content have nothing to do with one another whatsoever. Essentially there's the corpse of an executed killer in a warehouse where a bunch of people are supposed to be working but mostly just seem to walk around - a lot - and get killed. Low budget but fun.",1447891200,,595,4.0423728813559325
8194928,4,B000Q7ZL5G,"This movie is why I watch low budget horror movies. Every once in awhile you find a gem such as Old Hag. It is something a little different from what Hollywood keeps churning out. The story, acting and special effects were all very good. It held my attention from beginning to end. I will definitely watch it again.",1447113600,,315,4.448275862068965
8194929,1,B000Q7ZL5G,"I was looking for movies on SLEEP PARALYSIS which this claims to be about but after painfully watching the first half I realized that the movie synopsis is complete BS.  I should get my money back for this one. Low budget, the worst ""actors"" I have ever seen, and I don't even know what it's about - some dead serial killer in a box?  Don't waste your time or money.",1434931200,,366,4.214285714285714

8194931,5,B000Q7ZL5G,"I came across this online and to be honest I wasn't expecting much. I thought I'll give it a go and I am very pleased that I did. Despite it's obvious low budget this is a very entertaining and atmospheric film. Mainly filmed inside a large factory warehouse with a small cast it has a genuine sense of unease about it and some very creepy moments. The acting especially impressed me, particularly the main characters and the script was well written too. I especially enjoyed the performance of the inept security guard. The story concerns a group of workers on the night shift in a large warehouse, where the body of a recently deceased serial killer is being stored for research purposes. Strange things begin to happen when one of the workers open the crate for a look at the corpse. I would love to see what the director and cast could do with a bigger budget.",1233014400,5,864,4.509554140127388
8194932,2,B000Q7ZL5G,"Overall the movie was okay, good twist at the end. Bad acting and overall plot was poor. Characters were overblown, wouldn't have watched it except for a class project. It's a good movie to laugh at. Best thing was twist at the end other than that it's forgettable.",1228608000,2,265,4.541666666666667
