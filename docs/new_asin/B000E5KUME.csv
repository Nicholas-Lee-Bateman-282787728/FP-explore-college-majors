2491148,5,B000E5KUME,A horror film about a notorious lost horror film & it's Directed by maestro of horror John Carpenter & even though it's just under 60 minutes long it's still one of his very best efforts. Anyone that enjoys a good creepy scare will love this flick but as for horror film collector's such as myself this creepy little masterpiece will mean that much more.

Have you ever heard of a movie so horrible....so horrific....so incredible that it plagued your every waking thought?

This movie was so well done, almost every second had me wide-eyed and jaw gaping(Im not making this up).

2491151,5,B000E5KUME,"Masters of Horror is, at best, an uneven series, but this one is definitely a standout.  It's similar to Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" but with a lot more scares and some really nasty violence.  It may not have worked so well if it were a full-length movie, but for a one-hour episode, it's brilliant.  I gotta say, the series as a whole is a little disappointing, as some of them aren't horror at all, but comedies or political satires with some gore thrown in, which doesn't make them bad, necessarily, they're just not ""horror"" like the title would suggest.  The good news is that Cigarette Burns is a real horror show, and it's the best thing John Carpenter's done in at least a decade.  CHECK IT OUT!!",1140566400,19,715,4.511627906976744

2491188,4,B000E5KUME,"Carpenter's Cigarette Burns is a satire on the effect that horror movies have on audiences and critics. The spell woven by the movie within the movie, Le Fin Absolue du Monde, suggests the real-life spell woven by horror movies such as Carpenter's own Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What began as a low-budget tradition confined to drive-in's and grindhouse theatres has now become a million-dollar industry complete with horror festivals, horror groupies, and horror collectors.

Carpenter is right to observe that this addiction to horror is silly and maybe a little bit scary.

If you enjoy John Carpenter movies, or if you know your horror movies, you will enjoy this little shocker. But I'm sorry to say that, on the level of execution, Cigarette Burns has its flaws. The graphic violence is too violent. Norman Reedus, of The Walking Dead, gives a leaden, bland performance. The final fight between Reedus's character and his dead girlfriend's father is perfunctory and anticlimactic. The angel character's exact purpose in the story is unclear. Grainy, poorly matched stock footage of Paris at night makes everything look more low-budget than it needs to.

If you can overlook these flaws, however, you will find much to enjoy. Udo Kier steals the show with his performance as a hell-bent horror connoisseur. Chris Britton as a deranged horror critic and Gwynth Walsh as Bakovic's wife turn in inspired performances as well. Carpenter's son Cody contributed a spooky electronic soundtrack much in the style of his old man's music. And there's lots and lots of information about old movies and film lore that is, sadly, already vanishing from the new, digital age of moviemaking. (You'll learn what ""cigarette burns"" really are, among many other things.)",1408233600,,1799,5.154109589041096

John Carpenter's ""Cigarette Burns"" is essential to the Masters of Horror series.

This film is like a blast to the face with its perfect gore effects, suspensful horror, and acting from some of the best. In my opinion, the plot (invalving the search for a forbidden film) is almost inspirational. A key theme of this mini-movie is fear of the unknown and the battle of man vs self. Unlike other episodes, this one somehow is more thought-provoking. I honestly wanted to turn the tv off at one point, but I had the overwhelming urge to find out how it ends. This may only be a 1-hour movie, but it will be an hour well-spent.",1334534400,2,730,4.564885496183206
2491221,4,B000E5KUME,"Directed by John Carpenter, Cigarette Burns (2005) is generally regarded as one of the highlights of the first season of Mick Garris' Master of Horror series.  Well acted, and nicely paced, the film delivers some striking visuals and gore, as a man's search for a long lost film takes him down a dark path to disaster for all those concerned.

Norman Reedus delivers a strong performance as Kirby Sweetman, a financially strapped operator of a small movie theater in California, haunted by the suicide of his girlfriend Annie (Zara Taylor).  Sweetman is summoned by a wealthy collector named Mr. Ballinger (Udo Kier, in a very creepy performance), who has an angel with its wings removed (Chris Redman), imprisoned in his home.  Ballinger hires Sweetman to try and locate a copy of a film notorious for causing strange behavior in those who have seen it, including the director of the film, who tried to kill his wife before taking his own life.

The bizarre task eventually takes Sweetman to Paris, and then to a rendezvous in a warehouse outside the city, with a freaky film buff who likes to spill blood.  Sweetman somehow manages to escape a very messy situation and follows a lead to Vancouver, where the director's widow (Gwynyth Walsh) is living.  After an interesting and enlightening conversation, she gives the film to Sweetman, who then turns it over to Bellinger.  The collector's screening of the film triggers a violent finish, as all those who set eyes on it, are doomed to a horrific fate.  Continuously haunted by his dead girlfriend, Kirby Sweetman finds solace the only way he can, as his sacrifice does not go unappreciated.

Shot in Vancouver in about twenty days, John Carpenter does a solid job of bringing to life, the dark and twisted screenplay by Scott Swan and Drew McWeeny.  The story is kind of predictable, as you fully expect bad things to happen, however the nature and intensity of the violence still catches you unprepared, as the special effects are employed very effectively.  The DVD contains a nice set of extras, including a very informative and pleasant commentary track by Carpenter, an interview with the director, and a detailed look at how several scenes were shot.",1332201600,2,2210,4.89544235924933
2491222,2,B000E5KUME,"Instead of a television signal that induces a tumor in the viewer;s brain, driving him mad and inducing all kinds of mayhem (David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME), we have here an old, once-seen movie that drove the audience mad and induced all sorts of bloodshed.  The protagonist, on the trail of the movie, encounters one unpleasant episode after the other, which, instead of building tension, turns out to be monotonous.  Although John Carpenter did good work on THE THING and IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, this Master of Horror runs out of steam at about 10 minutes into its 58-minute run time.",1329523200,,587,4.86
2491253,4,B000E5KUME,"""Cigarette Burns"" is a very strange film; convoluted storyline (meaning it has many jarring edits and a very fast pace), unususal premise, and some very (!) gratuitous violence. A friend of mine from where I work told me about it, and I admittedly have never even seen the series, let alone this episode, so he lent me his copy. I was very, very tired when I first tried to watch it, so I drifted off right after the opening credits, only to wake up to see the main menu. My second attempt was a little more fruitful, you could say, but I woke up just in time for the final ten minutes...and Good Lord, what a wake-up call! The violence in this film is extremely hard-core.

The idea of a film which is so evil and horrifying it incites hallucinations and homicidal/suicidal behavior is quite far-fetched, and I'm surprised the people who hated ""Cigarette Burns"" never made a comparison to Monty Python's ""Funniest Joke In The World"" sketch. (Off-topic, so bear with me a moment.) In that bit, a humor writer created a joke that was so funny, anybody who heard or read it would laugh theirself to death. It was then used as a weapon in World War II, translated one word at a time by the British Army to render enemy German troops helpless. If you heard or read more than one word in sequence, you wound up in Intensive Care, laughing yourself into and out of consciousness, and if you heard or read the whole text, you would laugh so hard you'd die. It's an extremely funny bit.

This is what I thought of when I learned the premise of this story, but I knew it was supposed to be a horror tale; it is a John Carpenter work after all. Putting my prejudices aside, I saw that this is a disturbing story. A very, VERY wealthy collector has, in his custody, a mythical being who has large scars on his(?) back where wings once sprouted. And the collector has the wings mounted on the wall in his den, so we know right off what we are dealing with here. Later in the film, he admits that a person doesn't become this wealthy without burying a few bodies. He is an avid collector of entertainment memoriabilia, particularly rare films, and a supposedly lost film is what he now covets. The film's protagonist is hired to find it for him, and this person's life, already a train-wreck, keeps getting progressively more out of control as the story goes on.

In time, the film in question is located, and one of the story's early mysteries is somewhat disclosed in a very short glimpse of this diabolical movie. There is a lot left to our imagination, but it brings out something in the viewer's minds in the story that one would hope isn't there in ours. They are compelled, and are helpless to resist the urge, to act out one's most violent, grisley fantasies.

Again, it's well-made, weird, disturbing, fast, and very graphic. What is it about bodily violation and degradation that people like to watch?",1297209600,2,2898,4.503802281368821
2491254,3,B000E5KUME,"John Carpenter has proved his creativity in the past, with classics such as ""The Prince of Darkness"" and the original entry in the ""Halloween"" series as well as ""The Fog"", ""Christine"" and many other classic horror films over the years.  However, the legendary horror film director falls short with his entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" television show when he attempts something new with ""Cigarette Burns"".

""Cigarette Burns"" is essentially a movie about a movie.  The film begins by depicting a collector of rare movies, Mr. Bellinger, who hired a local film hunter and film expert, Kirby Sweetman to locate a rare film to add to his collection.  It appears as if Mr. Bellinger has become fascinated, and obsessed with a French film by the name of ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"", which translates into ""The Absolute End of the World"".  The film was created thirty years ago and was never even completed since the preview screening of the film lead to mass homicide counts within the audience members who viewed the screening.  The film was said to have been destroyed and that no copies exist, but Mr. Bellinger insists that at least one copy can still be located.

Mr. Bellinger's obsession with the film is shown in greater detail when the man takes Kirby Sweetman to a back room in his home to show him something disturbing, and awkward.  The isolated room contains a gray skinned man chained to the floor.  On his back are two holes were wings once were.  On the wall in Mr. Bellinger's office, Kirby gets a glimpse of the wings that were once a part of the man.  Mr. Bellinger states that both the man and the wings were parts of the original set of ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"".  The gray skinned man tells Kirby that he only exists because the film exists.  After seeing the disturbing scene, Kirby's curiosity is sparked, and he decides to take on the job for $200,000.

Kirby begins his hunt by locating a movie critic who was part of the audience that viewed the movie during its original screening thirty years ago.  The critic has become obsessed with the film, spending thirty years to write a new review on the movie.  The critic warns Kirby about the dangers of the film, and how everyone who has ever seen it has gone crazy with rage, violence, and even suicide.  The film has a way to manipulate its viewers into performing acts of violence they would not have done on their own free will.  The man leaves Kirby with a recorded interview that was taped several years ago with the director of the ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" in order to help Kirby further understand the power of the movie.

After listening to the tape and hearing the director's voice, Kirby begins to have visions of dream-like sequences and hallucinations concerning his past and his late wife.  The visions are always accompanied with a strange red circle, resembling a ""reel change"" image found in movies (located at the top right corner of all films).  Each vision dives into the past of Kirby, allowing the audience to view the origins of Kirby's current situation with his late wife's father, as well as the reasoning behind her death.

Kirby digs deeper and deeper into the location of the film, with each person he speaks with warning him of the dangers he will discover.  Every person who he talks to that has seen the film has been permanently scared in some way, either physically or mentally.  The movie continues to build up the suspense behind the mystery and supernatural powers of the film until the violent and disturbing conclusion.

The film has a decent pacing to it, it does not take too long to develop plot, yet it remains consistent in developing characters and character back-stories to a great extent.  The mystery behind the film is the major point of the plot, and when the viewer finally sees a glimpse of the movie at the end of the story, it is actually quite a let down.  ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" is not as terrifying as what the story describes it, and is in fact rather bland and boring.  John Carpenter himself has produced far more intense films than what ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" is.  This leaves the viewer wondering exactly how and why was the film able to produce such drastic results from all of its viewers.  Despite the let down that ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" is, ""Cigarette Burns"" is still a good short film in its own rights, but having the plot focus solely on a film that is reported as ""the scariest"" film of all time, takes away from the enjoyment of the movie.  ""Cigarette Burns"" features intense scenes of gore and violence and some rather chilling, disturbing moments, especially as the film progresses.  If the movie had focused more on the hallucinations and reactions/violence of the audience to the film rather than on the film itself, it may have been more enjoyable.  However, with the way it was setup, ""Cigarette Burns"" makes you dread hearing the words ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" one more time.",1283817600,,4931,4.637514384349827

We are led through an underground film scene that is a bit silly in its excesses and we are given gore when something more psychologically unsettling is called for.

2491257,4,B000E5KUME,"**Contains Spoilers **

The very first installment I saw from the graphic series ""Masters of Horror"" was John Carpenter's ""Cigarette Burns"". The story bears a close resemblence to his earlier work ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Mouth-of-Madness/dp/078062856X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Mouth of Madness</a>"". A young troubled theatre owner, Kirby Sweetman (Norman Reedus) is summoned by a shady and very rich collector (Udo Kier) to find a mythical film titled ""Le Fin Absolue du Monde"". According to legend, upon this films very first screening, it caused massive chaos and bloodshed as the theatre patrons went mad and ended up killing each other. The film was supposedly destroyed and everyone involved with the film have since died. Interesting idea. However, there is more. The shady art collector leads our protagonist into a room where a rather peculiar being is chained up. ""It"" is tall, pasty and appears to have had wings as is evidenced by the scar tissues on it's back. An angel perhaps? This mysterious being informs them that it is connected to this film like ""soul to flesh"" and if it had been destroyed, it would have known about it. So with this confirmation of the films existance and a very fat paycheck if the film is found, our troubled protagonist sets off to find ""Le Fin Absolue du Monde"" and the closer he comes to locating it, trouble and murder ensue.

""Cigarette Burns"" is, in my opinion, one of the best entries in the entire series. The film offers a lot of suspense and mixes this in with some gruesome gore sequences, especially during the film's climax. I also liked the film's premise and the questions it compels us to ask. Why is this film cursed? What causes the viewer to go mad? Why is everyone terrified of this film? The reasons are slightly addressed and that pale, withdrawn and nonetheless compelling entity chained up within the walls of the collectors opulant mansion holds the answer. Also when some very brief glimpses of the film are displayed, they are so non-sensical and disturbing that you are left wanting to see more of it but Carpenter was smart in giving us only a slight glimpse of the mayhem that is ""Le Fin absolue du Monde"".

Although Carpenter has tackled this subject matter before, he toned the fantasy element down quite a bit for this entry unlike his even more surrealistic ""In the Mouth of Madness"" however the fantasy is still there as is the gore. My only complaint lies with one of the performances. The film would have benefitted had a better leading man been cast. Norman Reedus' performance is bland and non convincing. The only time we see some real emotions are during the last few scenes when hell had clearly broken loose but by that time, it is too little too late. Despite this, ""Cigarette Burns"" remains the most consistantly chilling film of the MOH series. The episodes which followed may be gorier, more outlandish, but only a few were able to achieve what this one did in one short hour and that is deliver a solid story with intriguing elements, interesting characters, well done gore effects, a good pace and offer a satisfying conclusion.

2491258,2,B000E5KUME,"Having just finished the movie moments ago, I thought I would write my review. I bought it based on the high recommendations and reviews I saw here on Amazon, but the movie did not live up to my expectations.

Here's the thing- it could have been an awesome, scary movie. It didn't quite make it. Instead we have fake blood, poor acting, cheesy dialog, and we never actually get to see Le Fin de la Monde, the movie that the film is about. I wanted to like it. I thought it was a great premise- the idea that good or evil could actually be captured on film in a life changing way. But the execution was poor and I wasn't convinced. I would actually love to see a remake, longer with more thought put into the story line.",1247184000,3,720,4.217391304347826
2491259,3,B000E5KUME,"Not bad.

CIGARETTE BURNS tells the story of Kirby Sweetman (Played by Norman Reedus, who is a terrible actor...), a down-on-his-luck movie theater owner who freelances as a procurer of rare film prints. He's hired by a creepy rich guy (The always awesome Udo Kier) to find a copy of ""LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE"", a lost film that had one official showing in the early 1970's, which ended in the audience erupting into murderous violence. Sweetman tracks the film around the world, encountering various unsavory characters, getting closer and closer to finding the film and unraveling it's mysteries, but if he DOES find the film, will he be getting more than he bargained for?

Is this a return to form for Carpenter, who hasn't done anything worthwhile for almost 20 years? No. Not even close. It's got a GREAT premise, but the execution could have been better. Most of the acting is pure grade-z, the effects are decent, and the direction is competent at best.

The DVD comes packed with extras, which have fairly substantial running times, including a making-of, an interview with Carpenter, one with Reedus, a few commentary tracks, and a great little Carpenter career retrospective that has some cool behind-the-scenes tidbits from HALLOWEEN, THEY LIVE, & THE THING, among others.
The package is nice, too....Cover art by Ashley Wood, and a portrait of Carpenter (That also comes as a trading card inside the box) painted by Caniglia. They even reveal Caniglia's first name! Who knew?

This episode is really something. I did find it a little slow, but very intriguing all the same. It is very creepy, the atmosphere of it, is almost surreal, like a nightmare. We become immersed in this story, we really feel bad for the main character(Kirby), who lost his girlfriend, and is constantly harassed by her father (who obviously blames him for his daughter's death) for the payback of a loan. He is hired by a movie collecter to find a rare print, considered to be lost. The film is ""Le Fin Absolue Du Monde"". The story goes, at the only showing of the film, the audience was whipped into a homicidal rage. Kirby becomes obsessed with finding it...running into many horrors along the way.

""Cigarette Burns"" and
""Dreams In The Witch House""
is a truly great double feature
of mind-numbing horror.

Warning: extremely nasty and creepy.
Do not watch if you are pregnant
or have a weak heart.

These are not sadism or mysteries
masquerading as horror,
but authentic horror, that is,
not only scary, but regarding
things that are out of this world
coming into this world in a most
unfriendly way.
No happy endings here,
other than total gratification
for the horror movie fan.

As of this review,
I have only seen three of the
Masters Of Horror film series,
these two and ""the Fair-Haired Child""
(also excellent).
If these films are representative,
then I am greatly looking forward
to seeing the rest of them. I think.

[I'll try ""Jenifer"" (Dario Argento!) next]

They are not only original and well-plotted,
they are brilliantly implemented as well.
Masters of horror indeed.
This series was a great idea.
The element of competition may have
brought out the best in the participants.

Note Bene: The musical score for both films
are excellent, particularly John Carpenter's
""Cigarette Burns"".

""Dreams In The Witch House"" is an excellent
adaptation of H.P Lovecraft's universe(s)
by Stuart Gordon (see ""Dagon"" for another;

While it's been twenty years (or more, depending on your perspective) since John Carpenter has made a truly great feature-length film, Showtime's Masters of Horror series gives hard evidence that he hasn't lost an ounce of greatness in the intervening years. ""Cigarette Burns"", Carpenter's first-season entry in the series, is one of the best episodes I've seen so far.

Kirby Sweetman (The Boondock Saints' Norman Reedus) is the owner of a small revival-house movie theater, and a man who consults with others on finding hard-to-track-down movies. He is approached by a collector, Bellinger (Suspiria's Udo Kier), who wants him to track down a film called Le Fin Absolue du Monde, the only print of which was supposedly destroyed. It's an underground legend; supposedly it had only one screening, and it drove the audience to homicidal violence. To make matters worse, Sweetman has ghosts in his own past, and they're coming back to haunt him in the form of his late girlfriend's father, who loaned him a good amount of money to get his theater off the ground, and wants it back. When Bellinger agrees to pay Sweetman exactly the amount he needs to pay off the father, he's hooked. Unfortunately, the closer he gets to actually finding the film, the more it seems that some things were meant to stay buried...

Reedus and Kier do great work here, and Carpenter is back to the directorial form that produced such films as The Fog and Prince of Darkness, winding things to a supreme intensity and then cutting them open to see how far the blood will fly. And here, it does-- certainly farther than it ever did in any of Carpenter's theatrical releases. But then, the script here is a filmmaker's dream; the whole thing is awash in in-jokes and references, and it deals with finding a lost horror film. From a filmmaker's perspective, how cool can you get? It's obvious everyone involved here had a great deal of fun making this one. Definitely one to track down if you're a Carpenter fan. ****",1212105600,3,2051,4.837606837606837

2491277,4,B000E5KUME,"I assumed Cigarette Burns would be a winner since horror legend John Carpenter was responsible for it. Thankfully my assumption was correct. This was very well written, acted, and executed.

The story follows a man who has been payed a large sum of money to recover a horrific film that was allegedly destroyed after it's original viewing. He discovers the film is in exsitence and must do some detective work to find it. But the closer he gets to the film the more it begins to affect his mind. He begins to be plauged with strange visions and occurences as he chips away at the mystery behind the film. I don't want to give too much away so I will let you discover the rest.

This is one of the best MOH I have seen to date. I would definately recommend Cigarette Burns.",1195776000,,772,4.391608391608392
2491278,4,B000E5KUME,"When I first heard about the Showtime series MASTERS OF HORROR and who they had lined up I was thrilled. Enough so that I considered getting Showtime. But then I realized that these short films would find there way to DVD soon enough that I'd get the chance to see them that way and not have to deal with repetitive showings of the same movies over and over again. The wait was worth it.

Taking stories yet untold in film and handing them over to the top horror film directors of the past few decades is a great idea. Each has the opportunity to take on these tales of terror and make them their own. And fans of the genre as well as of these specific directors get a chance to revel in what they have to offer.

Who best to begin this series off with than the man who made horror legitimate again back in the 70s and continued in the genre afterwards: John Carpenter. Known mostly for his work in horror, Carpenter has dabbled successfully in other genres as well. But he remains tagged as a horror director. Which thankfully he doesn't mind.

Carpenter's tale is called ""Cigarette Burns"", a name that refers to the circular images in the corner of the screen that flash by letting you know something is going to happen or that a reel is about to change. But the tale itself deals more with film than it does its technical make up.

Norman Reedus plays Kirby Sweetman, a young man who runs a classic film theater while at the same time locating hard to find movies for collectors. One such collector is Mr. Ballinger (Udo Kier) who has summoned Kirby and put upon him the task of locating the infamous film, Le Fin Absolue Du Monde.

This film is legendary, one of the most difficult to find due to the history behind it. The film is said to have been shown only once. And during that screening, the entire audience went mad, tearing each other to shreds leaving a theatre drenched in blood.

For his role in finding the film, Kirby will receive the chance to run the film for 2 weeks as well as $200,000 a tidy sum that Kirby needs as the man who loaned him the money to start the theater is set to collect within a week. That same man happens to be the father of the woman Kirby loved, a woman he let down who committed suicide. And her father holds Kirby responsible.

As Kirby moves into his search for the film, the film begins to have an effect on him before he gets anywhere close. Flashes of burning rings appear before his eyes. Memories flood his mind. Blackouts begin to happen. There is more to this film than even Kirby is willing to admit. Every person Kirby comes into contact with that knows something about this movie tries to warn him to stay away. But he is relentless, in dire need of the money for his freedom as well as his own sense of curiosity about the film.

What he finds in the end is more than he bargained for. He does succeed in his quest, but at what cost in the end? What final effect does the film have on Mr. Ballinger, on Kirby and on those who chance to get a glimpse of it? Watch and see in this movie that keeps you interested from start to finish.

In my mind, a great director is one who leaves his stamp on what he produces while at the same time never making it overtly apparent that the film is uniquely his. Carpenter is a master at this. Each film bears his stamp and at the same time not in such a way as to make it noticeable. He truly IS a master and deserves to be in this series.",1191283200,2,3433,4.2450229709035225
2491279,3,B000E5KUME,If you saw the The Ring and The Ninth Gate (Johnny Depp) then don't bother to watch this movie. Cigarette burns is a combination of both films. Its not very scary. I give 3 out 5.,1190419200,,179,4.0
2491280,3,B000E5KUME,"Film connoisseur Kirby Sweetman (Reedus) is hired by creepy millionaire Mr. Bellinger (Kier) to find an incredibly rare print of a film called Le Fin Absolue du Monde (The Absolute End of the World). It only played once at an international film festival, and when it did, it apparently caused violence to erupt in the theater. When the director, Hans Backovic, tried to get it out of the country, the government seized it and destroyed it. Alas, it was a work in progress, so it was his only print.

Or so the story goes. Apparently it was not destroyed, and Bellinger wants it. Kirby doesn't believe it's really out there, but Bellinger has an ""unimpeachable"" source, which, apparently, he keeps chained and shackled in a room adjacent to his study.

Bellinger, in one of the early film's missteps, shows his source to Kirby; it's an angel, it's wings brutally hacked off-wings, I might add, that we saw hanging on the wall of Bellinger's study (a prop from the movie, he'd explained). The angel stands, morosely, spinning on a rotating pedestal, while bound to chains its frail body has no chance of escaping. Bellinger commands it tell Kirby what it told him, namely that it (and others like it) were ""bound to the negative like soul to flesh,"" so he would know if it had been destroyed.

So Kirby takes the case. His first step is to track down and speak with a film critic A.K. Meyers, who is one of the only survivors to have seen the film. He's been living as a recluse in upstate New York (in director John Carpenter's hometown of Carthage, as it happens). In a review, Meyers says ""Le Fin Absolue du Monde is not a movie but is more like a bullet fired directly into the collective brainpan of all those assembled and the only rational response is violence."" He goes on to tell Kirby that ""Backovic was a terrorist. He abused that trust we place in filmmakers. He didn't want to hurt his audience. He wanted to destroy them completely.""

Meyers gives Kirby a recorded interview Meyers did with Backovic at the festival prior to the screening. Kirby listens to the tapes, and as he does so, he starts to experience strange visions-haunting visages of his dead girlfriend punctuated by jarring circular images, not unlike those in the film The Ring. They're called cigarette burns, we learn, and people who have pursued or seen the film all report the phenomenon. They're called this because they resemble the ""cigarette burns"" that appear in the top corner of film reels, which serve as notification to the reel attendant that he needs to change reels.

Undeterred, not only because of his suddenly strong desire to see the film, but also because of his urgent need of the load of cash Bellinger is offering, Kirby goes to Paris to see what else he can learn there. There, Kirby follows some other leads, which put him in grave peril, but eventually leads him to the film.

He brings it to Bellinger...and bad things happen.

Cigarette Burns is actually quite scary at times, with some indisputably horrific scenes. However, like the previous episode in the series, Dreams in the Witch-House, it also aims high and falls short (though not quite as short) of the mark.

The acting is pretty solid; Reedus (Kirby) has an affable blandness about him, yet he manages to get the job done. He doesn't show a lot of emotion despite the inexplicable weirdness surrounding him, but his character is interesting, and while his performance doesn't raise the bar, it reaches it at the very least. Kier (Bellinger), however, is way, way, way over the top in his performance. I think he's kind of doomed to always be typecast as a somewhat creepy old guy in movies, but in this case he lays it on a bit too thick.

Above, I made reference to one of the film's missteps--when Bellinger shows the angel to Kirby. If this were a novel or short story, any good editor would have killed that scene; it was completely unnecessary and only serves to dumb-down the plot. Why should Kirby need the proof of an angel to go on this filmic treasure hunt? Bellinger offers to pay all his expenses and throws in $200,000 on top of all that. Seems to me, Kirby had 200,000 reasons to say yes, especially since he needs that money to repay a debt. And wouldn't the angel being revealed at the end have made it a much cooler plot point?

Carpenter (and/or the screenwriters) made several other questionable choices throughout the film. One is a diversion to a maniac film collector's home, which seems to be nothing more than an excuse for grotesque bloodshed. Another is the cigarette burns themselves-the phenomenon that pursuers of the film begin experiencing. It doesn't really make any sense and seems to be thrown in only for the visual effect.

Yet another misstep is when Bellinger's Asian butler thrusts a four or five inch blade into one eye, then the other. This strikes me as somewhat impossible-wouldn't the knife have gone into his brain with the first stab? If that didn't kill him instantly, would he have still be coordinated enough afterward to stab out his other eye? And then stick around long enough to assist in a critical plot point?

Not to mention the fact that Kirby ends up finding the film in the possession of Backovic's widow. If you were looking for a rare film, don't you think the filmmaker's widow might be one of the first people you'd check with? Of course, if he'd done that, the movie would have been a lot shorter.

The film within the film, Le Fin Absolue du Monde, is only seen in bits and pieces, which is of course necessary, by design. They couldn't well tell this story and make a coherent fictional film too. Also, how to depict something that's supposed to be so viscerally horrific that ""the only rational response is violence""? The bits and pieces we see are interesting and dark, but the viewer doesn't get any idea of what the film is actually supposed to be about. There doesn't seem to be any continuity in the scenes we see-it's just a jumble of random images. The creepy video in The Ring made more sense (and was creepier to boot).

I initially loved the premise, but quickly realized that it's quite derivative The Ring. It also reminded me a lot of Laird Barron's excellent recent novella ""The Imago Sequence"" (which was far superior to any work mentioned in this review), though I don't think the filmmakers could have read it pre-production, so the similarities are almost certainly a coincidence. Though these two factors diminished by admiration for the film somewhat, I still found it to be an enjoyable and laudable viewing experience...even if I did want to do a rewrite on the script so that I could see the film I wished this was.

And in the words of Kirby: ""I don't want to see an ordinary film. I want to see something extraordinary."" That was my problem with Cigarette Burns. But you've got to give Carpenter points for having the guts to put a line like that in his movie.

Cigarette Burns' extras are an interesting bunch. The featurettes are all well-worth your time if you're a big Carpenter fan, or if you're interested in learning how movie magic is brought to life on the big-or in this case, small-screen.

Carpenter comes off as a bit of a blowhard in parts of the various interviews, but he's an engaging speaker and offers some interesting insights into his process. He also curiously sort of undermines his entire film by calling one of its primary themes-that a film in the wrong hands can be a deadly weapon-a terrible clich&eacute;.",1188691200,,7993,4.754689754689755

Characters are never adequately introduced or established, there is no suspense, and nothing in it has any relevence to horror other than a realistic looking beheading which isn't even clear whether it really happened or if it was a dream sequence, and a ridiculous scene at the end of a guy feeding his intestines into the wheels of a film projector.

2491305,4,B000E5KUME,"As far as Masters of Horror goes, no one is contesting that John Carpenter belongs in the list.

If that's what you're expecting, you won't be disappointed.  Not that much, anyway.

I'll forgive the guy for essentially rehashing a plot that he already did so well (and so bizarrely) with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Mouth-of-Madness/dp/078062856X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Mouth of Madness</a>.  There's a movie somewhere out there entitled ""Le Fin Absolue du Monde,"" a grisly flick that's so disturbing that, at its premiere, most of the audience went insane and started killing each other.  Mr. Bellinger (Udo Kier as an unapologetically evil arcane film buff) wants to see this urban legend of a film before he dies, and he enlists in his search Kirby Sweetman, a tortured movie-house director who happens to be good at tracking down these sorts of things.

During his quest for the vile movie, Kirby encounters snuff film auteurs, chained and de-winged angels, and flashbacks to his own unsettling past, all accompanied by ""cigarette burns,"" strange glowing circles that, in the movie world, indicate a reel change.  There's disturbing (very disturbing) violence, dead-ends, and even a deranged movie critic, one of the film's original viewers, a survivor of the premiere who has spent the rest of his life writing a review that fills dozens and dozens of towering cardboard boxes (Carpenter's smug mockery of his detractors, perhaps?).

It's not surprising that Carpenter has done quite well what he's already done well before, but it is surprising that he would cast Norman Reedus as the lead, Kirby Sweetman.  I have listened to those who would defend his performance in this film, but the plain facts are that the man does an absolutely horrendous job.  In half of his scenes he wanders about with the dazed expressionlessness of a man who has woken up thirty seconds ago to find a film crew in his house.  The rest of the time he appears mildly drunk and seems annoyed by the fact that he has to do some more ""acting.""  I don't get why this guy wasn't fired after the first day.

Nevertheless, in spite of Reedus's incompetence, this short horror segment still works, which says a lot for Mr. Carpenter, et. al.  Shudder at the gore, scratch your head at the conclusion, and laugh at Norman's attempts to emote; ""Cigarette Burns"" may not drive you mad, but it will keep you entertained.",1179273600,3,2888,5.429530201342282

Even ""In the Mouth of Madness"" which I enjoyed for its Lovecraft-style themes and mood was more surreal than scary.  ""Cigarette Burns"" is both surreal and scary, with dark underlying religious tones.  There is the running undercurrent during the story of the fear of the unknown, or the unearthed secret and/or creation that should remain hidden for the sake of all mankind.  Themes that are undeniably Lovecraft.  I actually did not have a problem with the acting at all, I was simply too enthralled with the mystery and eventual horrifying climax to even notice.  The heart of the mystery is incredibly original and thought-provoking, the journey absolutely worth taking.

  Originality - which means not seen before - is a milestone.

  But to also have almost awe, True power and invention is a megamilestone, these days, or any days or nights.

  The closer the film expert got to finding the most obscure film in the world, which as you know drives viewers (like you) insane, the more the short film's fantastic nature was both revealed, and countered beautifully by reality, by explanations of, or a bit of evidence from,  real past events surrounding the piece, making very convincing what we could never believe for a minute. It created that magic of belief (or suspension of disbelief) more effectively than most movies with more believable horrors.

  But then it even goes where you daren't dream: so far as to define a good part of the film. And to do the impossible with a master stroke of credibility and definiton that is inspired is the fulfilment of the ideal horror movie. This resonated like the highest note of story telling.

  As for the lead guy -  I  think the beauty of his performance was he was not acting, like any laid back guy. It was underplayed, or natural, and contrasted perfectly with the supernatural. If you say he can't act - which of you in real life acts? He always reacted right to the horror and I had no trouble believing him.

  Udo Kier is perfectly eccentrically brilliant.

  Udo Kier is perfectly eccentrically brilliant.

  Besides the film reminding you of the films others have said, the film's film does remind one of H.P. Lovecraft's The Necronomicon book (tantalisingly realised in the flesh in Dream of the Witch House), as the most powerful - and dangerous - and elusive art made.

  Let's not forget though:

  'Twasn't JC who made the film, it was the writer created the beast.

EXTRAS:  The Other MoH:

  This was the first of MoH I saw. I picked it out of 8 2-story DVDs for rent (they weren't really that high - 20 feet, more like 20 centimetres). So I thought that finally a standard had been made, as Mick Garris did with his literal, reliable Stephen King adaptions.

  Dream of the Witch House, the DVD's second story, was half as good, but still fully good.

  So then I got 2 more DVDs. And, you see, I had to suffer the dreadful disappointment of - shall we say, the damned, or the dumbed. Two or three had good ideas barely put into action with hardly any horror.

  It highlights for me a real horror - the standard was too good to be true. I bet this is the only Masterful Masters of Horror film. Uncannily, like the film within this film, this film seems doomed or blessed to remain the only of its kind. Quite possibly the best short horror film made - even in the race in the longs - that cannot be repeated.",1170547200,7,2798,4.568825910931174

I was even able to watch Saw 3 without looking away, so something about this was different.

That's the point of a horror movie though, so I guess I'm glad I wasn't numb to the gore like most people because gore is so over-used in films these days.

Anyway, it was almost like The Ring meets Event Horizon. The only thing that took away from the film was the ""gollum"" guy. It made the movie seem less real. It was unecessary.

2491310,2,B000E5KUME,"'Halloween' is one of my five favorite horror movies ever, period. So it really disappointed me when after making such a suspenseful, well-crafted film, director John Carpenter turned to gore and lots of it to make movies scary. Great scary movies can have gore (like 'The Evil Dead' and 'An American Werewolf in London', for example), but they shouldn't rely on it, thinking the more gore, the scarier it is going to get. Carpenter's MASTERS OF HORROR story, 'Cigarette Burns', contains scenes like a guy putting his intestines on a film reel and lots of bloody, battered bodies, and I couldn't help but yearn for the good ol' days. Unfortunately, most of John's films after 'Halloween' are gore-packed, and only one ('The Thing') comes to mind that actually worked.

 As for the story, I really was confused at times as the main character met many shady characters, but it involves a film that had a first showing where its viewers turned demented and homicidal. The film in question is wanted by a weird collector played by Udo Kier, and he asks a man famous for finding any old, forgotten film for you to hunt down the film and get it for him. From there, secrets are revealed, the actor playing the main character shows the acting range of a stump, and gore hits the screen like bugs on a windshield.

 If you liked this MASTERS installment, more power to you, but I really am tired of movies with stomach-churning gore that don't remember that horror movies should be scary, and it's even more upsetting because Mr. Carpenter used to know that (although reportedly John requested 'Halloween II' be grosser because the audiences wanted it and thus he could make more of a profit, so shame on you, moviegoers, and shame on you, John, for being greedy). The screenwriters do attempt a coherent story, and although confusing, at least there is a plot to cling to.

As his journey unfolds, Kirby learns the secrets behind the film's production, and the demonic truth that lay underneath the celluloid.  Considering Carpenter's recent body of work, Cigarette Burns is a nice change of pace.  Most of the criticisms of of Cigarette Burns arise from Reedus' performance, and while he may not be the best leading man, he's not as terrible as what's been described in previous reviews.  The makeup and gore effects are top notch as usual, and for most of it's running time, Cigarette Burns is one of the better entries in the Masters of Horror series.  All in all, Cigarette Burns is better than it's been given credit for, and is definitely worth checking out for Carpenter lovers and horror afficiondos alike.",1161734400,6,1158,4.8232323232323235
2491313,5,B000E5KUME,"I've never seen any of John Carpenter's movies; the legendary 'The Thing', 'Halloween', or 'The Fog', but I can say that he has easily justified his place as a Master of Horror with this film. Despite the fact that nearly all of the other 'Masters of Horror' movies in this series are weak, poorly conceived, and even more poorly executed (with the exception of Don Coscarelli's 'Incident on and off a Mountain Road'), this movie comes out strong and holds interest until its bloody conclusion.

While some may complain about the low-budget of the movie, I am of the opinion that Phantasm and Evil Dead are the pinnacle of the horror genre, and this movie lives up to that tradition. Among this particular sub-genre of horror, production values take second to resourcefulness, originality, and panache. Cigarette Burns has all of these in spades.

Unfortunately, nearly the entire cast of actors are unable to do the film justice. Norman Reedus is the poor man's Paul Walker, which is to say that he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Udo Kier is someone who I've wanted to see leave the film business ever since I first saw him in a movie. There are, however, some incredible supporting actors, such as the Angel and the insane filmmaker featured in the movie.

One of the things I'd wondered since reading the back of the jacket and being intrigued by the concept for the story, was 'are they actually going to SHOW this movie that makes you go insane? Will it be believable, or is it a lost cause?'. When the film finally is shown at the movie's conclusion, the clip does, indeed, do it justice.

All in all, despite the low budget, low-caliber actors, and one-hour time constraint, this movie is worth five stars.",1156982400,3,1723,4.676567656765677
2491314,5,B000E5KUME,"On first viewing, I was somewhat disappointed with ""Cigarette Burns,"" but the more I watched it, the more I liked it.  The plot is about a movie that does bad things to people if they even go looking for a print of it; you don't even have to see the film for it to affect you.  The commentary track by the authors was informative, but perhaps a little too enthusiastic; it's obvious they are completely thrilled to be working with an established director like John Carpenter.  The interview with John Carpenter was also good.",1154908800,,525,4.5638297872340425

Very creepy, extremely gory, and an all-around pleasurable horror experience.

From what I've seen, this is the best out of the ""Masters of Horror"" series.

2491347,3,B000E5KUME,"Cigarette Burns is John Carpenter's episodic contribution to the Showtime series, Masters of Horror. A 13-episode horror anthology thought up by Mick Garris (a fellow horror director best known for adapting Stephen King stories) which includes eleven other directors known for their work in the horror genre.

John Carpenter works off of a screenplay that posits an interesting premise about an infamous film that caused the audience it was shown to the first time to go homicidal. The story itself involves a man known in the film community as someone who can find and hunt down any copy of film no matter how rare. Norman Reedus (he of Blade II and Boondock Saints) plays the cinephile who takes on the job to hunt down a copy of this infamous film titled ""Le Fin Absolue Du Monde"". His client is played with relish by resident weirdo Udo Kier. Really, Kier can be given any role and he'll add his brand of idiosyncracy and weirdness to the role. In Cigarette Burns he plays an obsessive fan of the rare film to the hilt. His contribution to the the climactic ending will bring a smile to gorehounds everywhere. Alas, it's Kier's performance that's the highlight of the acting in Cigarette Burns. Reedus' performance as Kirby Sweetman the cinephile leaves much to be desired. The screenplay itself was already average, but with genuine ideas that could be explored if the acting could raise it beyond its C-grade pedigree, but Reedus wasn't up to it.

Carpenter's directing really can't be faulted for the major flaws in the screenplay and in his leads performance. It's not early Carpenter, but his work in Cigarette Burns was much better than what he's done in his last couple films. One reviewer has already mentioned that this episode has abit of In the Mouth of Madness in it and its an apt comparison. Instead of a book influencing the sanity of the reader, its a film that does it instead. A film that may or may not have divine origins that doesn't just turn its viewers homicidal but bend their sense of reality.

I think with a better cast and a screenplay that's worked on abit more by  its writers, Cigarette Burns could've been a great episode in the Masters of Horror anthology. Instead, it's just a very good film with great gore sequences, but brought low due to a very rough screenplay and a lead actor in Norman Reedus who seemed stoned, drunk or both throughout his entire performance. It's not something great, but a good showing from Carpenter that said he's not as washed-up as many seem to be calling him.",1152144000,2,2530,4.704288939051919
2491348,4,B000E5KUME,"John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli, Takashi Miike.  These are some of the powerhouse names in horror that were enlisted to direct episodes of ""Masters of Horror"", a 13-episode series that debuted last fall on the Showtime network.  Comparisons to other TV horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone and Friday the 13th were inevitably made but ""Masters"" decidedly differs from those in several aspects as there is no host, no commercials and little trace of humor/camp.  No, Masters of Horror is a no holds barred hardcore horror anthology that gives full creative freedom to its directors, many of them names that have been known to not pull any punches whatsoever.

What I particularly like about the show is that there is no guiding voice, or TV producer, telling the director how things should be.  Each episode has the director's own personal stamp on it, to give us the feeling that ""This is not a masters of horror episode, it's a Dario Argento movie, or a Takashi Miike movie, etc.""  The result of this creative freedom and unique concept is an anthology where every episode feels uniquely distinct from one another.

""Cigarette Burns"" is directed by none other than John Carpenter, arguably the most famous of the directors involved and a man who needs little introduction to fans of the genre.  Carpenter has directed over a dozen timeless horror and horror/sci-fi hybrid classics such as ""Halloween"", ""The Thing"", ""The Fog"", ""Escape From New York"" and the list goes on and on.  In his contribution to the series Carpenter explores themes of obsession, addiction and personal vindication.

Kirby Sweetman is a movie programmer swimming in debt who is hired by a creepy collector (played in typical subdued fashion by Udo Kier) to find the sole existing film print of the super-rare ""Le fin absolue du monde"", a film allegedly shown only once some 30 years ago and rumored to have driven its audience into a murderous rampage before the theater mysteriously erupted into flames.  Sweetman's obsessive search leads him to New York, Paris and finally Vancouver and during his search Sweetman (who has many demons in his past) comes to the realization that the film's infamous reputation is well-deserved.

I had high hopes for this particular episode in light of being a huge Carpenter and also due to the interesting plot synopsis.  My expectations were somewhat fulfilled.  ""Cigarette Burns"" suffers from a bit of an identity crisis: it's a bit low on the ""horror"" quotient, feeling more like a private investigation show with paranormal elements thrown in that recall the x-files.  It's not like most of Carpenter's work, although there are definitely resemblances to ""In the mouth of Madness"".  The acting is subpar for the most part and that's usually something to be expected in TV productions however when it's the central character who is the main offender it's a tougher pill to swallow.  That Wahlberg brother look-alike is a truly awful actor!

Still, ""Cigarette Burns"" does keep us on our toes with an aura of mystique and intrigue as well as satisfying our appetite when it finally shows us clips of this infamous film that drives people to madness.  There are also about a handful of eye-poppingly disturbing gore scenes throughout.  ""Cigarette Burns"" is bleak, nihilistic and definitely worth a look.",1150588800,6,3377,5.017921146953405
2491349,1,B000E5KUME,"I was a fan of Assault on Precinct 13 long before the film became well-known; I've also liked some other things by Carpenter... I didn't care for the writing here, didn't care for the story. Can't blame Carpenter for that.

There is a beheading here that really wasn't necessary; you've also got one guy pulling his own guts out of his belly... Huh? Too much. What's the point?

Another scene that turned my stomach is the one where the bald-headed actor sits on Norman Reedus'es lap at one point and starts licking his face (or gets close enough to where he is about to do this; same thing to me). Come on, man. John. Why? You let the scene go on way too long.

Granted, Mick Garris should be applauded for starting up this entire Masters of Horror idea...but thus far  the series has been a big let down for me.

The other episode I saw  is Don Cascarelli's Incident On and Off A Mountain Road. That one didn't work  for me either.

 Want to see a recent horror flick that works big time--and wipes out every one of these Masters of Horror directors? See ROOMS FOR TOURISTS, directed by Adrian Garcia Bogliano. Made for THREE GRAND by a guy in his early 20s.

2491350,4,B000E5KUME,"The moment I saw John Carpenter's name in the list of directors who were attached to the horror series Masters of Horror I knew for a fact that I had to watch it. Seeing a lot of the other major directors on the list was impressive, but for me just seeing John Carpenter attached to it had me excited right away. He's directed many great and memorable movies, including my all time favorite horror film Halloween with the remake The Thing in a close second. What I love the most about Carpenters films is that he can take a basic plot and so much with it in the movie. He also has a trust with actors and I honestly think that it's a great way of film making. Improve can do a lot if it's done right and Carpenter is open to different ideas and that's the part of film making that I honestly enjoy hearing.

If I had to pick one episode to represent the first season of Masters of Horror, I would definitely pick John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns. I thought the other episodes were pretty good, but this one blew them all away. John Carpenter has had his ups and downs with films and this one is just a step in the right direction. Cigarette Burns tells the story of a man who is hired to find a very rare film. A rich man is in fear that his days are up and hires a guy to find a film called 'Le Fin Absolue du Monde'. A film which has a mysterious past and is known for making its viewers snap on a violent rampage. As the man digs deeper in his search he realizes that something is taking control of his thoughts and flashing nightmarish past events.

John Carpenter has brought us some wonderful movies over the years. As I mentioned before he's the man who scared us all with 'Halloween' and even directed possibly the greatest horror remake of all time 'The Thing'. Carpenter is my favorite horror movie director and this was the episode that I looked forward to the most. It was definitely worth the wait, I was expecting something great and I got exactly what I had hoped for. Cigarette Burns is a great movie. Everything from the story to the characters makes this episode a good watch. It's It also has some really great looking gore for all you blood hounds to drool over. This just episode shows the true genius that Carpenter is as a film maker. Unlike some of the other episodes, this one has no humor. Its a dead serious and pretty straight forward episode. Most of it runs as a mystery and about half way through all the good stuff starts to happen. Once you actually see what this dark film does to people its just straight madness and by the end of the episode it all makes sense. This is just one of those episodes that you have to see.

The acting in this episode is also really good, I have no complaints. It's a dialog driven film so there is a lot of talking and story in it, but those were just some of the things in the film that I personally enjoyed. The plot to the film reminded me of In the Mouth of Madness, a much older john Carpenter picture. The music in this film is also really good. Cody Carpenter did a fantastic job with the score. But most of all I have to tip my hat off to the writers Drew McWeeny and Scott Swan. This episode was very well written and enjoyable. After it was all over I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed. I love this episode so much and it really put me in a good mood when it was done. I wish that I could write more but I don't know what else to say. I enjoyed the hell out of Cigarette Burns. I loved the story, I loved the score, I loved the characters and all the good stuff that goes in between.

The major difference with this DVD is that the special features are shorter compared to the others. It has the same basic features and you do learn quite a bit of stuff. With the interviews they run pretty short. I'm guessing that perhaps Carpenter didn't really have much to say about the films or his career in the genre, but the features are still really good. This Masters of Horror episode is my favorite in the first season and I don't think I'll get tired of watching it. I enjoyed Cigarette burns very much. I've always loved Carpenter's directing skills and this DVD made me appreciate his work even more. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who will say that John Carpenter's episode is one of the best in the series. You'd be crazy not to enjoy it.",1146182400,3,4328,4.229746070133011
2491351,4,B000E5KUME,"Thank God someone decided to call JC to direct something worthwhile and nothing like his last few ""efforts"". This story, like all the rest of the shorts in this series, actually has you gripped from the start and continues to do so right to the bloody ending. And it has to be said that this could be the nastiest outing we've had from Carpenter for years. Check out the beheading scene!! Udo Keir is just perfect too for his role, but isn't he always superb?

  The greatest thing about this dvd are the special features, in particular the John Carpenter interview. In fact it's worth buying this dvd just for that!!! If you have always been a lover of the great man, you may not be after this. Boy does he explode at the idiot interviewer. Though I can't blame him. Go buy it!!",1144886400,3,779,4.395833333333333
2491352,4,B000E5KUME,"An entertaining and fairly compelling story by first time writers Drew McWeeny (aka the movie/DVD reviewer known as ""Moriarty"" on the ""Ain't It Cool"" web site) and Scott Swan is brought home by veteran horror director John Carpenter.  All horror fans will likely find something here to enjoy, though it will be especially fun for ""film geek"" types who obsessively follow favorite directors and can recount the names and plots of the most obscure movies faster than they can remember the names of certain cousins.

Admittedly, two or three things could have been done better in this quickly-filmed production (for example, it should have been more of a slow, dramatic reveal when we learn that a film critic has filled reams and reams of paper with one endless review of the mysterious, infamous horror movie everyone is searching for), but overall the story unfolds well, measured and methodical when it needs to be and weird and crazy when those things are needed.

I also liked the nice balance been artiness and good old storytelling craftsmanship in the final piece.  ""Cigarette Burns"" keeps things mysterious and, well, artful by not over-explaining every little question that naturally occurs to the viewer, but it explains enough and keeps the narrative ""normal"" enough that, despite the mysteries and unanswered questions at the conclusion, we still feel like we were given a satisfying, coherent story.  Just be warned that ultimately it's a blood-soaked satisfying, coherent story you'll be getting.

And if the creepy, gory main feature isn't enough for you, this modestly priced DVD also gives you a generous set of extras.  I especially enjoyed the two DVD commentaries, one by the director and one by the writers.  Taken together, the commentaries give viewers a detailed and comprehensive look at the dynamic, energetic collaborative process between the writers, actors, and director that resulted in this edgy little horror film.

So, in the end, I'd give the actual short film (it clocks in at a shade under an hour) a solid three stars, and the generous DVD package as a whole a well-earned five stars.  That averages out to the four-star rating I'm giving the whole thing overall.  And that should be more than enough incentive to pony up the few bucks they're asking for this surprisingly entertaining DVD offering.",1144368000,14,2335,5.0546875

 The obvious humour in Udo Kier feeding his intestines into the projector was amplified when I realised the taped copy I always had of this was censored. It's even better with the gore in! Udo Kier is a brilliant actor and he's great in this too not only his acting in the ""I make my own movie"" scene all sweating and wild eyed but his mocking of the angel he has kidnapped like some movie memorabilia ornament. A younger Norman Reedus (Daryl from The Walking Dead) is good in this too as he sets out to find 'La Fin Absolue du Monde' for Udo Kier's Mr. Bellinger.
