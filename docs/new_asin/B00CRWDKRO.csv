5736368,5,B00CRWDKRO,"""Cat. 8"" is a film that would have done well at the theater, with all of its action and energy! Matthew Modine is well cast as the physicist who can save the world and I enjoyed Ted Whittall playing the ""evil"" Secretary of Defense with just enough meanness!

The explosions and devastation are kept to a minimum for this type of disaster film and though not everything is scientifically credible (getting a special light ray to our Sun would take more than a few seconds - LOL!), just pass on the inaccuracies and enjoy a wonderful three-hour, two-part presentation perfect for the entire family!",1373932800,33,596,4.730769230769231

5736375,5,B00CRWDKRO,"darn good movie for the money on a used DVD movie. The one dude that was the secretary of defense i would of  shot the prick in the head long before the movie was over with.. But like always in movies there always has to be a bad ass in there. And he was one of  them. Very good long timed movie. 2 Hrs, 52 Mins without the words etc at the end off movie i timed it on my DVD player. i never used the glossary at the end of the movies. i only count the hrs and minutes  to the end of the movie. They always have 3 to 5 minutes after the movies of actors etc. well  worth  the money for the movie. Good entertainment for over 2 hr movie. my daughters account i use all the time.",1492732800,2,677,3.773049645390071

5736384,5,B00CRWDKRO,"I've given this movie five stars because it is so heroically bad that you just can't look away. True, I did have to run to the kitchen a few times to slam my head in the freezer door, but that aside, I laughed myself to the point of incontinence for most of the three hour running time.
Forget the astonishingly ridiculous 'science'. Dismiss the special effects that make the original Thunderbirds look cutting edge. You can even forgive the attempts at sort of acting. What cannot be overlooked, and the reason why I am sporting ten stitches in my head, is the script. It is so atrocious, so mind-numbingly dire, that it should be used to fight world terrorism. Fanatics the world over would be sent running after just five minutes of this utter bilge.
I forced myself to finish this movie as a bet with myself. I now feel dirty and stupider than I was three hours ago.

5736406,5,B00CRWDKRO,"Why 5 *'s? Easy, I really liked it. The soldiers in these e movies look so fake so often that as one of them by proxy, it AlWAYS detracts from the story seeing stupid stuff (iv's the wrong direction, uniforms Inappropriate for the mission, silly acting). But in this movies, it got almost everything right. Restarting the core was NOT explained well, but then I'm a scienc geek and scifi writer. To not detract from the movies plot, the answer is that there was SO MUCH ENERGY INJECTED INTO THE CORE, IT DID WHAT IT DID. The only way to fix it is to light the proverbial tipping point fuse. The story and acting was above par, the girls were MERCIFULLY NOT PORTRAYED AS WIMPS. That alone bought me the movie. I ordered the bluray as I liked it that much... Oh no pirate bay here: Netflix and I add to my collection (over 600 now) movies worth it. Eta here in three days... So, if you like these movies, you will be very happy with it. I hope a sequel happens... Story plot would need to be good, but the cast did really well and got along great. The soldiers acted like such without the stupid cheesy stuff I really dislike. The sneaky bast***s are sneaky and slick! the supporting casts all acted pretty natural. So the whole palate was represented. Well done! Get it.",1425340800,7,1269,4.38135593220339

5736432,2,B00CRWDKRO,"To be fair I didn't finish watching it, I gave up after 40 minutes. It was slightly amusing in a ""so bad it's good"" way for a while, but then it just gets stale. The acting is terrible and the characters are so badly written they look like walking stereotypes. The ""romantic subplot"" is cringeworthy, especially the overprotective father bit, who for a scientist seems to not understand how statistics work.
Oh, and don't get me started on the science, I doubt the writers asked anyone about solar flares before writing out of their asses.",1387843200,2,539,4.684210526315789

It's refreshing to have a ""category #"" movie that's not about hurricanes, tornadoes or earthquakes.  Those are cool also, but at least this one is different.  Also, it's a long movie with two parts - I really liked that!",1383091200,26,398,4.28

Aside from that, it would have been good for the scientists who staged the first demonstration to try to keep it in the realm of reality.  These folks shot a beam into the SUN, and it got there in about 5 seconds.  Considering the fact that light from the sun takes over 8 minutes to reach us, it begs the question of how they sped up the speed of light to this extent.  This is bush league guys, if you can't acknowledge something that most folks (I would hope) know in this day and age, you need to reexamine the kinds of shows you're making.",1525996800,,737,4.169014084507042
