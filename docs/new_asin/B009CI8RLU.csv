8539626,4,B009CI8RLU,"A real life LAPD hero.  Story is about Sgt. Charles Stoker, and based on his expose and published book, THICKER' N THIEVES. Sgt. Stoker testified before the 1949 L.A. Grand Jury informing them of major LA corruption inside the LAPD.
Mostly accurate portrayal of events that occurred at the very start of Chief William Parker's attempts to reform a corrupt LAPD and the man who helped him do it. Highly recommended.",1363305600,3,414,4.830985915492958
