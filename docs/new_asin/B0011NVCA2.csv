3067255,5,B0011NVCA2,"Thankfully, CBS/Paramount is not delaying the DVD release of the second-half of the first season of this iconic Classic TV Police action, drama. While it's more expensive for viewers to have to purchase half-season sets, it's better than not having these wonderful Classic TV shows on DVD at all.

Mod Squad is the original counter-culture phenomenon that remains a fan favorite, replete with one of the best and most memorable TV musical themes ever composed. It remains very, very watchable despite its age - ironically, now older than what was considered trustworthy in adults during that era.

Premiering Sept. 24, 1968, during the height of the Viet Nam War, Mod Squad lasted for five action packed seasons with episodes that dealt as much with social issues as it did crime in the streets.

Set in Los Angeles, the premiss was simple enough: Three young people in trouble with the law are given the opportunity of avoiding jail sentences by infiltrating the counter-culture as undercover cops and exposing criminal who prey on youth. The idea is for them to bridge the generation gap between the youth and the ""fuzz.""

The three ""delinquents"" were Pete Cochran, portrayed by Michael Cole, who was arrested for car theft; Julie Barnes, portrayed by Peggy Lipton, who ran away from her prostitute mother in San Francisco; and Lincoln Hayes, portrayed by Clarence Williams III, who was arrested during the Watts riots. Tough talking Capt. Adam Greer, portrayed by Tige Andrews, was in charge of the special squad and eventually became a father-figure to them. (Lipton, who later played Norma the waitress in another cult classic -  Twin Peaks -  was nominated for an Emmy for her role as Julie, and won a Golden Globe in 1970 for her portrayal of the character.)

In the series, Cochran drove an old green ""woody"" side-paneled stationwagon that became a lasting symbol of the show, along with cooooool bell-bottomed pants! Sadly, the wheels were destroyed in the second season when the car was set ablaze by an arsonist.

The stellar series spawned a block-buster movie in the 1990's that was horrible by comparison, failing in all respects to capture the chemistry and remarkably innocent sincerity of the original.

Specials included on this DVD set include a featurette on the ""mod"" style of Peggy Lipton.

Included in this set are the final 13 episodes that comprised the first season: The Sunday Drivers; Hello Mother, My Name is Julie; Flight Five Doesn't Answer; Shell Game; Fear is the Bucking Horse; A Hint of Darkness, A Hint of Light; The Uptight Town; A Reign of Guns; A Run for the Money; Child of Sorrow, Child of Light; Keep the Faith, Baby; Captain Greer, Call Surgery; Peace Now - Arly Blau; and A Seat by the Window.

Created by the legendary TV mogul Aaron Spelling, he produced it along with Danny Thomas and Sheldon Leonard. Harve Bennett replaced Spelling in later seasons.

Bring on the rest of the series - can you dig it?",1198281600,19,2949,4.876

Julie, Linc and Pete have really become a family and Captain Greer is a lot more trusting of our young cops, and becomes like a surrogate father.

There's a 10-minute featurette called, ""Hello, My Name Is Julie: The Mod Look"" where Peggy Lipton talks about the wardrobe for her character ""Julie Barnes.""

3067275,5,B0011NVCA2,"The Mod Squad is a seminal television show for several reasons. One is that it was so clearly a product of its times - from the clothes, hairdos, to its rebellious, revolutionary, hippie sensibilities.

The second reason is that The Mod Squad was the beginning of the legendary producing legacy of Aaron Spelling, and his many years of providing viewer-friendly programs to both ABC and Fox. Although he had worked as an actor and writer, and had already produced Johnny Ringo and Burke's Law, The Mod Squad began an incredible and unprecedented almost forty year run of producing television shows that captured fans with either high-octane action sequences, or opulent comedies or soap-operatic dramas. The partial list includes The Rookies, SWAT, Charlie's Angels, Starsky and Hutch, Vegas, Hotel, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Dynasty, Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, and Charmed.

But still at the heart of this show was the rapport and relationship between the three street kids who were rounded up and rehabilitated into undercover cops - rich kid Pete Cochran (Michael Cole), runaway Julie Barnes (Peggy Lipton), and taciturn revolutionary Lincoln Hayes (Clarence Williams III. Pete, Julie, and Linc had immediate street cred with the mostly young felons they ran across, and even though it could be testy or frosty, their relationship with their mentor and rehabilitator, Captain Adam Greer (played by Tige Andrews)was solid, and they grew to have much mutual love and respect and affection.

The shows could stretch credulity almost to the breaking point, but the shows dealt with relevant issues, were very entertaining, and well written and well acted.

It is a great treat to watch these episodes again, and we can look forward to the release of the other episodes with great anticipation.",1198627200,8,1806,5.195876288659794

3301772,5,B0011NVCA2,"The Mod Squad is a seminal television show for several reasons. One is that it was so clearly a product of its times - from the clothes, hairdos, to its rebellious, revolutionary, hippie sensibilities.

The second reason is that The Mod Squad was the beginning of the legendary producing legacy of Aaron Spelling, and his many years of providing viewer-friendly programs to both ABC and Fox. Although he had worked as an actor and writer, and had already produced Johnny Ringo and Burke's Law, The Mod Squad began an incredible and unprecedented almost forty year run of producing television shows that captured fans with either high-octane action sequences, or opulent comedies or soap-operatic dramas. The partial list includes The Rookies, SWAT, Charlie's Angels, Starsky and Hutch, Vegas, Hotel, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Dynasty, Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, and Charmed.

But still at the heart of this show was the rapport and relationship between the three street kids who were rounded up and rehabilitated into undercover cops - rich kid Pete Cochran (Michael Cole), runaway Julie Barnes (Peggy Lipton), and taciturn revolutionary Lincoln Hayes (Clarence Williams III. Pete, Julie, and Linc had immediate street cred with the mostly young felons they ran across, and even though it could be testy or frosty, their relationship with their mentor and rehabilitator, Captain Adam Greer (played by Tige Andrews)was solid, and they grew to have much mutual love and respect and affection.

The shows could stretch credulity almost to the breaking point, but the shows dealt with relevant issues, were very entertaining, and well written and well acted.

It is a great treat to watch these episodes again, and we can look forward to the release of the other episodes with great anticipation.",1198627200,8,1806,5.195876288659794
