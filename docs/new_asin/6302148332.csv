432320,5,6302148332,"A charming little musical that grabbed me from the beginning, Lili is not as simple as it looks or sounds.  This is definitely a character-actor driven movie, with Leslie Caron carrying the weight of film with her wide-eyed charm.  The movie touches on dark issues like suicide, attempted rape, homelessness, poverty, bitterness, and thwarted dreams, but in a marvel of restraint, it doesn't dwell on these things and overemphasize them.  The real focus is Lili's beautiful hope and joy in living.
An orphan, Lili joins up with a traveling circus.  She's helplessly naive, but with the family-like troupe and the puppets in her carnival act, she blossoms into a poised, lovely creature.  The puppets themselves are quite interesting and significant - see how they resemble the live characters.  In the midst of all this, the only clouds in her sky are her boss (the brooding puppeteer, Berthalet, played to perfection by the sexy Mel Ferrer) and her unattainable crush (the vainglorious Marcus the Magnificent).  Her coming-of-age is the main plot, made both satisfying and achingly real.
Leslie Caron pulls off the role admirably.  Lili is endearingly sweet, without going over the top.  Caron draws you in before you even know you've been charmed off your feet.  Lili loves and hates so simply until she learns better, and then you see her mature realistically.  It's rings inexplicably true.  The two dance sequences showcase Caron's extensive ballet skills without becoming huge productions that halt the story's progress.  In fact, they actually carry the story further - something not all musical pieces accomplish if you think about it.  The fantasy one is marvelous in revealing Lili's alter-ego - she's sexy and confident, and ultimately, not Lili.  The last is particularly moving as both participants come together emotionally.  Caron's face and feet act as much as the rest of her put together - a good thing, as her English is rather accented.
Most of the movie is sort of dreamy and surreal.  The brief ""real-life"" location scenes look real, while the rest has the-painted-backdrop feel with clearly fake sets and props.  This actually doesn't detract from the movie or the story, since they are not actually terribly relevant.  The characters hold center stage.  A feel-good movie if you just want to be entertained, a thought-provoking movie if you want to be engaged.
See also Paul Gallico's Love of Seven Dolls, the novella this movie and the musical, Carnival, were based upon.  (A warning, the book explores the darker side of the story, but also worthwhile for mature readers.)",1028764800,,2598,5.080188679245283
432321,5,6302148332,"First off, I like this movie very much. But it would be a naive folly (similar to the behavior that characterizes Lili) to deny the darker overtones of this movie. Being that this is a classic film, I'm sure I won't be ruining it for anyone by pointing out specific instances.
The movie opens on the scene in which the poor orphaned Lili finds that the baker (friend of her father who promised to take her in) has died. Though this is a convenient plot devise, the twin deaths of father and future hope are morbid. The shop keeper who informs her of this offers her employment, then tries to molest her. She is ""saved"" from his unwelcome advances by the entry of Marcus, the handsome magician. She falls in love with her savior, though even the most casual observer sees he is a flirt (and a cad, later).
When Lili loses all hope (her job and the attention of Marcus the Magnificent), she does intend to commit suicide. Bertoli saves her (or, namely, Carrottop saves her), but the concept is rather dark for such an innocent-seeming film.
The bitterness of Bertoli (Mel Ferrer) is understandable, given the war injury that ended his promising dancing career, and his secret love for Lili is indearing. However, his treatment of her is rough and brutal (he even slaps her in one scene). Lili realizes she has fallen in love with his softer sides through the puppets (Ferrer delivers a powerful speech on the facets of the male personality embodied in the puppets), the dance illustrating this is mesmerizing. But, even given the cheerful ending, do they live happily ever after? Will the syndication (of sorts) of the puppet show be enough to heal his emotional scars? It is possible that he may return to his drunken anger and brutal behavior eventually, isn't it?
Also, not to put too fine a face on it, the subject of acting is bound to come up in a review. Leslie Caron has always been a favorite of mine, and this role easily compares with the similar one in ""Gigi."" Her acting is touching and genuinely innocent, but I know her to be capable of much more elaborate dancing, as illustrated in many other movies like ""Daddy Long Legs"" and ""An American in Paris."" Mel Ferer is handsome and powerful in his performance as the lame puppeteer. Jean Pierre Aumont is convincing as the charming womanizer magician. But it is evident that all Zsa Zsa Gabor's talents lie in her looks. I'm convinced the choreographer of the competitive dance between Lili and the magician's assistant purposely kept the dance simple mirroring to disguise Gabor's lack of talent. She could have done so much more with her lines, but came off as flat and annoying. Perhaps the characters of the magician and his assistant, both beautiful and empty inside, were perfectly meant for each other.
To wrap up this lengthy critique, I do think this is a wonderful movie for adults who like depth and shaded characters. I found it ideal for one such as myself, interested in seeing what lies beyond the facade.",1011571200,,2980,4.667300380228137
432322,5,6302148332,My mom frist introuducted me to Lili about a couple of months ago. When i frist saw it I thought it was one of the best musicals i ever saw. It warmed my heart from the beggining to the end. Lili is about a 16-year-old girl named Lili that falls in love with a magician only the magician in a carnival. When she finds confort in the puppets she forgets all her troubles. When she relizes that the magician is married ehr heart is broken. She then leaves the carinval and travels but her heart brings her back to some one that does love her....,1009324800,,543,4.180952380952381
432323,5,6302148332,A wonderful tender story of an orphane girl who falls in love with a hurting but loving puppeter. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's a story you can't forget.  Mel Ferrer and Leslie Caron are perfect in their roles.  I would give this 10 stars if I could it's so good.  A really sweet romantic movie.,995760000,,318,4.163934426229508
432324,5,6302148332,"Honestly, I liked the movie.  Particularly the dance sequence, which I thought was painfully romantic.  And, well, Mel Ferrer...  But you know, then you read pratically every review written by a man for this, especially that guy from New York, and you begin to think.  Because in reality, he is right, and the rest of us are just fooling ourselves.  This movie is just plain creepy.  Even I became disturbed by her excessively childish behaviour.  So, yeah, watch it for Mr. Ferrer, and do not think about it!",977011200,2,509,4.715909090909091
432325,4,6302148332,"I was only four years old when my parents took us to see Lili.  I had mostly memories of the puppets and how they danced and came ""alive"" to Lili. The song, Hi Lili Hi Lili Hi Lo, I must've sung  for years after.  Well, times change, and so, I guess, have I. Seeing Lili  45 years later, I was disappointed only once  obviously having forgotten  Mel Ferrer smacking Lili ""up long side the head"" (only  ""once"", that's enough for me, thanks) I certainly don't see the  movie in the same light now..., but I regressed to four again  and enjoyed it for what it really is.  A story with music and puppets and a  carnival, the immediate maturing of an young, naive female in the early  fifties, in France.  Still, to my enjoyment, a great view.  Thanks.",966988800,,747,4.318840579710145
432326,4,6302148332,"While, niether the movie or the perfromces are on the same level of Roman holday (1953) this is very wonderful film that works for both audlts and kids.  For the kid there are the dancing and the puppets and for the adults  there is the wonderful love story.  The movie could however could have been  much better if it did not have a hollywood (happy) ending.  Note on dimise  of the live action hollywood musical.  One has to look to the four  productions that sunk it.  Mary Poppens pure unadulted suger, one need a  dose of insulen after seeing it.  The second the sound of music plabulm.  Hello dolley- filmed at the cost of 2 waterworlds.  Finally lost harizons/  evitia, self important wastes of film stock",955756800,,712,4.5476190476190474
432327,2,6302148332,"You must read the NY viewer's ""creepy"" review.  It's positively hilarious and mostly astute.  Alas, another musical in which Caron plays the title ingenue with a repetitive two syllable name.  I'm surprised the  musicals ""Kiki"" and ""Fifi"" weren't made, or were they?  Anyway, this one is slightly more bearable than Gigi.  The storyline is no  less inane, and the songs are no less annoying but, it is shorter and there  are fewer songs.  Caron is somewhat charming, and Zsa Zsa is somewhat  feisty.  Why do the creators of musicals insist on putting in these  idiotic, supposedly symbolic, song or dance sequences which are meant to  neatly wrap up the whole story?  Frankly, the end dance sequence with the  puppets was almost excruciating to watch. This movie is one of the reasons  why musicals are now only made in animated versions for children.",950659200,3,851,4.887323943661972
432328,5,6302148332,"I have never seen such a beautiful and tender movie in my entire life. I recommend it definetly. Leslie Caron is an incredible actress as the naive and sweet Lili.

432408,5,6302148332,"Delicacy and tenderness weren't usually the highlights of MGM musicals in the fifties, but this one is exceptional. I saw it first as a thirteen year-old, and was totally captivated. I just watched it again at 76, and was charmed all over again. You've been given enough of the plot to understand - a shy girl (Leslie Caron) with a crush on a ""beautiful magician"" (the ever-charming Jean Pierre Aumont) is brought into a puppet show by ""the angry man"" who hides his love behind the curtain. For my money, this was Mel Ferrer's best performance, because he was so perfectly cast. Kurt Kaznar is a warm best friend, and Zsa Zsa Gabor gets to sparkle, too. The cast lives up to Helen Deutsch's beautiful screenplay, and Charles Walters directs with a feathery touch so that the tale never seems corny or strained. Lili can cast a spell over you, too. You've probably grown up with the song, which was actually composed by the screenwriter Deutsch and Bronislaw Caper. The dances are both in dream sequences - one saucy and upbeat, and the final ballet that is one of the best examples of romantic tenderness I've seen on screen.",1497052800,,1125,4.658291457286432

crippled and bitter puppet-master is quite touching and sensitive throughout.  Ferrer began his career as a dancer and his musical scenes with Caron, also a dancer, are most enjoyable to watch.  Of course, Lilli and the puppet-master eventually get together for the ultimate happy ending!
Jean-Pierre Aumont, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Kurt Kasnar are all fascinating to watch as they assist the young central characters fall in love.  Good

432742,5,6302148332,"I love the films she has made but I have never been a Leslie Caron fan per se.  Having said that, however, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed her in this film which also stars the very tall and handsome, Mel Ferrer, the handsome and always debonaire, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Kurt Kasznar and Zsa Zsa Gabor.  Watch for a quick screen appearance by Amanda Blake, who we remember as Miss Kitty, owner of The Long Branch Saloon, on TV's long running series, Gunsmoke!  The diminutive Lili Daurier is an orphan of only 16 when she comes to a small town in search of the friend of her father. He is the town baker who is supposed to help Lili if anything happens to her father.  Of course, Lili's father has died and she is now hoping to secure employment with him in his bakery.  Upon her arrival at the address, she finds the store is dark and deserted.  The shop-keeper next door informs her that the baker passed away just a month ago!  This man realizes Lili is now without anyone at all and offers her a job selling notions and a place to stay in his store!  This quickly turns out to be a case of his wanting much more from her than simply her shop duties!  She is saved from this man's advances by the entrance of Marc (Jean-Pierre Aumont) who is there to buy some things for his magic act in the carnival he is part of which has just set down stakes in the town! She quickly exits the shop with Marc and is instantly taken with his undeniable charm!  Waiting for him are two of his carnival comrades, Paul & Jacquot, who have a puppet act there. Paul ignores her altogether and in fact, is a bit gruff with her, but it is Jacquot who takes pity on her and recommends that Paul talk to his friend who runs the food ""Cabaret"" so that Lili can work there.  Marc is also a bit taken by Lili, but when he learns she is only 16, backs away quickly!  Marc actually secures the job for her serving customers at the Cabaret, but she is really terrible at it and is let go before the first shift is over!  It seems she was more interested in watching Marc's feats of magic than doing her job!  Lili speaks to Marc after his show but it seems he doesn't really care and he rebuffs her again when he discovers she has lost her job. Not knowing where to turn, Lili is now very sad, depressed and low about her situation and starts to wander through the carnival stalls until nightfall.  She is contemplating doing away with herself when suddenly, Paul, who Lili calls ""The Angry Man,"" sees her and tries to get her to pay attention to the puppets he is now speaking through. She walks over and meets the red headed ""Carrot Top"" who then introduces Lili to ""Golo"" the Giant, ""Reynardo"" the Wolf and ""Marguerite"" the Dancing Lady. A crowd of workers has gathered to watch by now and together, she and Carrot Top sing the adorable song, Hi-Lili-Hi Lo, while Marguerite dances.  The result is absolutely charming. She has met the puppets one by one and is conversing with them as though it were the most natural thing in the world!  Paul & Jacquot realize that the customers are going to love this new part of the act and...I'm going to leave it right there so that you can follow the rest of it when you see the film...and see it you must!  It's a great little film, so enjoy it! PS: Caron was only 5'1"" and Ferrer was 6'3"" and I've always thought the final dream dance sequence, a marvel in movie making!",1421539200,,3385,4.29559748427673

The artistic conception revealed in many scenes, without benefit of computer graphics or heavy video manipulation, bolsters acting and costuming and small details to provide a simple, innocent, but delightful experience. Leslie Caron was so well known as a young rising ballet star, but her contributions to significant movies over the years include everything from Daddy Longlegs with Fred Astaire to the Trials of Nurenberg. She was a talented all-around actress, and a graceful sprite of a dancer. Her chemistry with the rest of the cast was excellent in this, one of her earlier works. Mel Ferrer showed a depth I did not see in most of his pictures, and Kurt Kastner, another old-time favorite, was a delight. Even today, so many years away from when it was produced, it is still worth a viewing to of a time and place that will never return.

The music, especially the lovely ""Hi Lili Hi Lo"" is perfectly evocative of the sentimentality of the story, and the performances are all perfect for the story.  Some of the best work ever of Mel Ferrer, Jean Pierre Aumont, Kurt Kaznar, and even Zsa Zsa Gabor!

432976,4,6302148332,"This review is for the Warner Archives 2012 DVD release.

Lili, finally on DVD!  Yes, well...

Many of us have loved this film for years, even decades.  For some reason, MGM has always seemed to have relegated the film to a second rate place, even though it is blessed with a stellar cast, six Academy Award nominations and a memorable score by Bronislau Kaper.  And who can forget the puppets?!

So, finally the film sees the light of day on a domestic DVD release, remastered (I use the term loosely).  However, it is as a Warner Archives on-demand.  Now, I have seen on-demand films from Warner that looked quite amazing, but this is not the case with Lili, unfortunately.  Yes, they may have remastered it, but by the looks of it, they put in a modest effort.  At times, even film splotches pop up.  Some scenes look wonderful, others somewhat faded and just slightly better than a VHS transfer.  While I was not expecting Blu Ray quality (and why not, the film deserves it!), parts of the film barely stand up to DVD quality.

On the other hand, the film does look better than we have seen it in its VHS release and we should be thankful it has been released at all.  I was just hoping it would have gotten the treatment other classics such as 'Auntie Mame' or 'The Women' have gotten.  Let us hope one day Lili will be honored as the beautiful classic it is.  In the meantime, we have this version, better than any before, but not as good as it should be.  If you ever got the import DVD version, this one looks ten times better.

Should you buy it?  Yes!  Will you be bowled over by the quality? Not totally...but it will do.

By the way, while it is not Widescreen, it is the film's original aspect ratio.",1352764800,6,1713,4.374603174603174
432977,5,6302148332,"This contains some spoilers...........

I'll never understand why this movie more or less disappeared from view not so long after it was made, in spite of Academy Award nominations and famous, attractive actors taking the starring parts and playing them so well. That is to say, it ""disappeared from view"" in the UK.

I first saw the movie in London in the 60's in one of those little cinemas that only showed old movies. I was completely entranced. I waited endlessly for it to be shown on TV and in those days we had only 2-3 TV channels so it would be difficult to miss. After perhaps 20-25 years, I saw it was to be shown - and to my fury my video-recorder failed so I still never got to see it again.

So then I waited endlessly for a video of the movie but never saw one in the country area where I moved some years after seeing the movie. Finally we got the internet and Amazon but by then I needed a DVD and that too never appeared and anyway I don't recall if there was any video version left by then available anywhere.

WHAT ON EARTH WAS WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE THAT IT WAS UNWANTED ON TV AND DVD UNTIL NOW?

The story is based on one of my favourite books, The Love of Seven Dolls by Paul Gallico. I read all Gallico's books and they were always entrancing. The book is dark whilst the movie is decidedly anodynised, but this doesn't matter too much since the movie is delightful in its own right. In the book, Michel is a seriously damaged personality and is a brute and treats Lili (alias Mouche) horribly. Mouche is an orphan who reaches the depths of despair and sets out to commit suicide, but then she sees the puppets and they save her. Seeing how she brings in the crowds when she talks to the puppets, Michel takes control of her including physically. Yet when he puts on his puppet shows, all the characters adore Mouche and their sweet and loving care for her heals the wounds caused by Michel's physical and mental cruelty. Mouche lives a strange double life in this time, as it seems almost as though the puppets are not worked by Michel but are themselves animate. Under that vile and vicious exterior Michel loves Mouche  deeply, but is so brutalised by his past that he barely understands what love means and anyway has no way of showing love to her openly.

Despairing of any kindness from Michel, Mouche is thrilled by a flashy acrobat who takes a liking to her, and decides to leave with him. The end surely everyone knows, when the despairing puppets beg Mouche not to leave, Mouche finally reminds herself it is Michel who is putting the words into their mouths and she tears aside the curtain to see the despairing man who has no idea how to communicate with his love except through his puppets.

Whether they can be happy, so damaged as they both are, we can't be sure but at least there is great hope. In the movie this is turned into a light-hearted sweet tale without any of the real darkness and none of the brutality.

In the movie, Mel Ferrer makes Michel sufficiently frustrated and poignant for this light-hearted story but not the desperately damaged individual of the book. Leslis Caron is of course simply delightful and perfect for the part of the rather innocent, almost childish Lili who grows up in this story. The time that in the book Mouche spends being the possession of Michel is completely omitted. She soon falls for attractive but rather self-centred Jean-Pierre Aumont's character, and only realises she loves Michel when she's trying to leave and in a sort of vision she sees him crying out to her and then the same sequence with the puppets as in the book completes the story.

The music throughout is delightful and no wonder it won awards. Yet at least here in the UK, why didn't we even have an LP of it? Or if we did, it must have been sold out and removed from the catalogue by the time I saw the movie and searched fruitlessly for one in the big London stores.

I so wish the original plot and characters had been followed, but I doubt Hollywood could have done it in a musical. It was far too dark and some of the scenes would have been totally unsuitable for children. It would I think have worked well as a French movie seeing the whole story is set in France and the French wouldn't have balked at the dark aspects.

There's a rather similar, wonderful and painful Italian movie called La Strada. I really think this is based on the same story - the brute who treats his wife abominably, and finally she falls for the acrobat type and tries to free herself. A simply wonderful movie and this time not running away from the dark material.",1352505600,3,4606,4.43144208037825
432988,4,6302148332,"This is one of those ""lost"" classics that I've been waiting for years to be released on DVD, and it deserved better than an ""on demand"" DVD-R release. To me, this film should have been treated with as much care as Leslie Caron's other signature roles--Gigi and An American in Paris. However, it would seem that Warner Brothers, which controlled the home video rights to this film, could not find a decent print of the original theatrical release and finally decided better something than nothing. This DVD is apparently from the ""best"" available 1:33:1 pan-and-scan television print--and it shows. Although Warner claims that it is ""remastered,"" it looks ""old."" While it certainly looks better than the VHS and Spanish import DVD, there are plenty of artifacts, dirt and imperfection, although fortunately not terribly distracting. Colors are OK, and close-ups are passable, but medium to long shots have progressively poor detail. Still, if this is the best we can hope for, it is ""better"" than nothing. As for the movie itself, it may be a bit ""dated"" and an anachronism of a more ""romantic"" time (although at times Paul's behavior toward Lili is sometimes hard to take, and Lili seems a little too naive), but for those so inclined, it stirs an emotional response that is so rare these days. Bronislau Kaper's music certainly provides an enormous lift to the material, and although there is no dialogue in the final 10 minutes, Lili's fantasy in which she finally ""sees"" Paul can melt even a hard heart.",1352419200,5,1506,4.909803921568628

Aside from that, I've been looking forward to purchasing this DVD for ages and have been gravely disappointed, having been an Amazon customer for many years and purchased many DVDs from sellers which have all been very good experiences.

433010,2,6302148332,"IMPORTANT NOTE: Since writing this review, Warner Archive has released this title as a Burn-on-Demand DVD. I subsequently purchased a copy of this release directly from WB and can report that the quality of that transfer is excellent.

Those areas of the following review that relate to transfer quality are for the Region 2 release only.

As far as the quality of this film's content, it is excellent. It is well-produced, well-acted by an excellent cast with a wonderfully touching story. However, the video quality of this DVD release is quite poor. I cannot say with assurance if it was transferred from video tape, however I would feel confident in saying that it was not digitally remastered from film, as the image lacks the crispness one usually expects from DVD.

The color is very inconsistent, vacillating from over-saturated (often to the point of bleeding) to somewhat washed out (aberrations quite common to old dubbed video tapes), sometimes doing so in the same scene. It is interesting that the authentic MGM/UA VHS release is of similar quality as far as the variations in color (even changing hue in the same scenes as on the DVD), although there is very little, if any, over-saturation on the tape version.

Sadly, this is another great movie that has not been released on DVD with the quality it deserves. As there is nothing on the packaging that indicates any connection to the studio that actually produced the film, it reminds me of the reproductions of public domain material one might find on DVD at the local dollar store (although the cover artwork is of a better quality) and, in my opinion, at $28.99 this item is severely over-priced. Overall, a big disappointment. Unless you are desperate to own this title on DVD, regardless of the video quality, I would recommend that you save your money.

433014,5,6302148332,"Lili is a superb motion picture that focuses on a young woman's coming of age; this is remarkable in that so many coming of age films highlight a young lad's entering adulthood. Indeed, the film is notable in more ways than just that: the acting and choreography for the dance scenes are impeccable; and the musical score was very well written with a theme song that is easy on the ear. In addition, the casting was very well done and the script was well written. Unfortunately, however, this outstanding film badly needs a restoration. For example, unless there's a close-up of an actor all too often their faces are slightly fuzzy and that's a shame.

When the story starts in France, we meet young Lili Daurier (Leslie Caron) whose father has just died; she has come to another town but the family friend she was to stay with and work for has died as well! A neighboring merchant is interested in hiring Lili--but he also wants his way with her which is very much against her wishes! Fortunately, Lili is rescued by the handsome carnival magician Paul Berthalet (Mel Ferrer) and it isn't long before she follows Paul and his friends to their traveling carnival where she gets a job as a waitress. It also isn't long before young Lili becomes infatuated with Paul and she's not exactly happy to see Paul has a beautiful female assistant, Rosalie (Zsa Zsa Gabor).

Lili's job as a waitress doesn't work out; and just when Lili is about to kill herself by jumping off a tall ladder used in a carnival act she is rescued again, this time by the puppets used by the person Lili calls ""the angry man,"" Marc (Jean-Pierre Aumont). Marc, a young famous dancer with so much potential, injured his leg in World War Two and he is extremely bitter; he became a puppeteer after the war. In addition, Marc can only express his loving and gentler side through his puppets and the young, nave Lili talks with them as if they were human beings while Marc hides behind the curtain, making the puppets move and giving them their voices. Adult passers-by love it and Lili then gets her second job with the carnival--she is to work with Marc and his puppeteer assistant Jacquot (Kurt Kasznar) in a new puppet act for adults.

As if all this weren't enough, the movie also shows how Lili learns about life and its sometimes harsh realities; Leslie Caron does a great job of portraying Lili as she learns important lessons about life while she moves from adolescence to adulthood. Lili learns much through her relationships with Marc, Paul, Rosalie and others.

Of course the plot can go in many different directions. Lili wants Paul to be her boyfriend but he is in a relationship with Rosalie; and poor Marc cannot seem to tell Lili directly that he is growing fonder of her every day. And what happens when Lili is noticed working so well with Marc and Jacquot in the carnival--they get a big job offer but will they take it or refuse it--and why? And just how does Lili come of age? No plot spoilers here--watch and find out!

Lili charmed me with its beautiful ballet scenes and the coming of age story is skillfully and memorably told. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it as well as anyone who likes coming of age stories. People who enjoy films with sophisticated dance sequences will not be disappointed.",1276041600,3,3313,4.598984771573604
433015,5,6302148332,"On a superficial level, I can see why the DVD people have so far omitted this one BUT they've made a big mistake. Yes, the film 'Lili' is dated in some respects, including the unflattering (to 21st century eyes) 50s dress that Leslie Caron wears for the dance sequence at the end. But if this film is to be allowe to die into obscurity, we all miss out on a unique and magical evocation of the timeless world of circus and puppets and the lovely Leslie Caron at her best as an actress and dancer. If celebrity interest is required, could the screen romance between Caron's orphaned ingenue and the grumpy puppeteer, played by Mel Ferrer, prefigure the real life marriage between Mel Ferrer and the gamine actress and dancer, Audrey Hepburn? Add to this mix the haunting number 'High Lili, high low' and you have, as they say, something for all the family. DVD makers PLEASE TAKE NOTE.",1266019200,2,884,4.566037735849057

433036,5,6302148332,"I'm happily adding my 5 stars to those of many previous reviewers here. This is a lovely gem -- and while it's a terrific family film in the best sense of the phrase, as enjoyable to small children as to adults, it also negotiates some darker & troubling emotional territory with subtle skill. The themes of innocence, unrequited love, crippling bitterness, and callous self-absorption, are all explored in a fairy tale framework, soaked in vibrant Technicolor.

Leslie Caron is perfectly cast as Lili. Not even Audrey Hepburn, the screen gamine supreme, could have brought this character to life as well. Her navet, her vulnerability, her open & yearning heart are embodied with utterly convincing grace & ease by the wide-eyed Caron.

Mel Ferrer is equally good as the crippled dancer turned puppeteer, unable to express his volatile emotions except through his puppets -- who are not, contrary to the Amazon reviewer, the least bit creepy! The ballet sequence in which the puppets become real, and reveal their true face to Lili, is a marvel of psychological revelation.

The supporting cast is also up to the task, with warm & delightful turns by Kurt Kasznar & Zsa Zsa Gabor -- and Jean-Pierre Aumont radiates spoiled narcissism with hatefully icy disdain. But in the end, this is Leslie Caron's show, and she fills every colorful frame with life, wonder, and sensitivity.

Now, how much longer must we wait for the DVD? A film this good should have been available years ago, preferably with extras & commentary -- most highly recommended!",1234310400,5,1544,4.9728682170542635

She is smitten with the carnival magician ,Marco the Magnificent (Jean-Pierre Aumont),a flambouyant and self absorbed man who lives with the attractive Rosalie (Zsa Zsa Gabor).She is oblivious to the love felt for  her by the carnival puppeteer ,an embittered former classical dancer Bertholet (Mel Ferrer)a man only able to demonstrate his feelings for her through the medium of his puppets .She becomes part of the act as the other puppets manipulated by Bertholet and his friend Jacquot(Kurt Kaznar)dispense advice and seek to ease her pain .She sees him only as a drunk mourning his past carrer ,snatched from him by accident ,when the chance arises to move the act upmarket her sorrow at her unrequited love for Marco and anger towards Bertholet as major barriers that need to be overcome .

Caron is sweet and charming as Lili bringing the right gamine quality to the role and Mel Ferrer is exceptional as Bertholet while gabor's performance represents a career high. She shows herself to be a capable actress and the always reliable Kaznar is solid and dependable as ever. Aumont did not cut it for me but otherwise this is well acted even when you consider the  human actors  are hard pressed to match the charm of the puppets .It also benefits from deft direction by Charles Walters ,fine cinematography from Robert Planek and an Oscar winning score by Bronislau Kapek which includes that feather light beauty of a song ""Hi-Lili Hi Lo"".

I actually purchased two used VHS issues; the first displayed so much color damage, I ordered a second. Unfortunately, both VHS copies looked exactly alike. It's a sharp image with very clear audio, but engineers who mastered this tape did a thorough job of wrecking what once was some of the most beautiful Technicolor work in the business. Some scenes are far too green, too blue, too red, or washed-out. But it's a solid image with plenty of detail, so with some skill, a PC, some good software, and a huge load of patience, the VHS can make a decent transfer to DVD (my project took 2 months, and I hope I never have to go thru anything like that again). With all the junk out there in digital format, it's a shame that better films like ""Lili"" have to languish in flawed VHS. That said, it's a great romantic fantasy with lovely music. The performances are memorable (Aumont is terrific), the only weak spot being Mr. Ferrer, who does a competent job but seems miscast.

433041,4,6302148332,"'Lili' opens in the bright atmosphere of a French town with a likable 16-year-old orphan looking for a job with her deceased father's old friend... Lili soon discovers that the place is close and the baker with whom she came to work with has died a month ago...

With no money, no family, and no place to go, Lili meets Marc, a delightful entertainer who offers her a job as a waitress in a traveling carnival show...

Marc's hilarious blend of comedy and magic leaves the wistful Lili roaring with laughter... Marc is breathtakingly good on stage... He is blessed with the fastest hands in the business... Lili is fired, that same night, for spending too much time watching his whole act...

Feeling intensely sad, hopeless, drained and helpless, Lili thinks of killing herself... She begins to climb a highly wooden staircase, ignoring a gently voice calling her to come along... She is distracted by a group of character puppets, who helps her forget her sorrow...

Lili is introduced to Carrot Top, the interesting fellow capable of running his life and everybody else; to Golo, the cowardly giant longing to be loved; to Reynaldo, the thief and opportunist full of compromises and lies; and finally to Marguerite, the vain, jealous beauty obsessed with self...

Childishly happy with the colorful puppets, and not realizing that she is having a big impact, Lili receives the ovation that ignites her creative spark, responding to the four unique puppets losing herself in their questions and imaginations...

When she is asked to sing, Lili belts out an old song of love... The entire company of puppets behind her joined in for a stirring chorus... This was executed to perfection that night - accompanied by the waltzing music of the accordion...

The show is a hit! Lili's childish manner proves she can entertain, persuade and appeal...

But Lili remains dazzled by Marc, who reinforces his spoken humor with visual effects... She dislikes the boss, Paul Berthalet, believing him to be cruel, heartless, frustrated and always angry...

Mel Ferrer had the talent for improvisation... He uses his puppets with humor, voice sound effects, stories and more...He captures Lili's heart and soul... And by speaking through his models he was able to express his anxiety, curiosity, austerity, and confusion...

Lili, touched by the magic of romance, comes to understand the meaning of love much later... She tells Marcus: 'I've been living in a dream like a little girl, not seeing what I didn't want to see.' She discovers that the love exuding from her adorable puppets comes from the loves of that unreasonable, mean, jealous, bitter puppeteer...

Jean-Pierre Aumont adds his charm to the whole story, and remains the beautiful magician armed with an exceptionally likable stage personality...

Kurt Kaszner continues to be Paul's loyal and peaceful friend who explains to the delicate girl that the boss had once been a great dancer until his leg was injured in the war and could no longer dance...

Zsa Zsa Gabor behaves as the glamorous assistant whose fervent desire is to reveal to everybody her secret...

Charles Walters' motion picture is not very musical, but his film culminates in a delightful dream ballet... Caron demonstrates a graceful dancing...

The movie received six Academy Award nominations including Leslie Caron as Best Actress in a Leading Role, and won the Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and accommodated the hit song ""Hi Lili, Hi Lo.'",1167955200,12,3486,5.027777777777778

433043,5,6302148332,"How hard can it be to find a film with elements of homelessness, unemployment, despair, suicidal thoughts, thievery, feigned affection, disability and self-pity? Not very hard you say. But in a G-rated film barely eighty minutes long?

Still unavailable on DVD format, ""Lili"" (1953), is available only as a rare ""Video Compact Disc"" (VCD) which compresses movies onto (at least two) CD-sized disks; i.e., a CD which contains moving pictures and sound. By using an MPEG compression standard, VCDs can hold up to 700 Mb (eighty minutes) of full-motion video and quality stereo sound and can be played on almost all standalone DVD players and PCs. VCD quality is similar to that of VHS tapes.

VCD not withstanding, and barely a decade after ""The Wizard of Oz,"" MGM still made the industry's best-looking films. The sets, costumes and color of ""Lili"" are outstanding. And at least two things in the film suggest that 1939 classic -- a puppet named ""Golo"" who resembles Burt Lahr's ""Cowardly Lion,"" and a surreal, yellowish road on which Lili eventually seeks something better.

We first meet Lili (Leslie Caron), an orphaned teenager, at a bakery where a friend of her late father had promised her a job. But he too has died. Homeless and unemployed, she falls in with some traveling circus performers whose act causes her inattentiveness which immediately costs her the job she does get.

Deflated, she climbs a trapeze ladder but is thwarted by the high-pitched voice of ""Carrot Top,"" one of four puppets manned by Paul Berthalet (Mel Ferrer). Paul is overtly bitter that his limp has reduced him from a once-famous dancer to a puppeteer on a French midway. He is particularly aloof towards Lili, except during his puppets' ""conversations"" with her, planned spontaneities which have become growing nightly attractions at the circus. Through these improvisations with her savior Carrot Top plus a foxy kleptomaniac named Reynardo, a cowardly giant called Golo and the pulchritudinous ballerina, ""Margurite,"" she and Paul can communicate their true feelings as well as introduce the hit song, `Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo"" (Best Score Oscar).

Sparring regularly with Paul, ""the angry man,"" she is genuinely hurt when she learns that Marc (Jean-Paul Aumont), a vain womanizing magician, is married to Rosalie, his assistant (Gabor). Marc delights in flaunting Lili's childlike advances, warning her ""never come on to a man like that."" Marc is either a true heel or is perhaps too absorbed in himself to realize that Lili genuinely loves him.

Although not a musical, the film does contain two wistful ballet dream sequences which showcase Caron's considerable dancing talent. It is thru these musings that she begins to mature as a woman.

When Lili learns that Marc and Rosalie are married and plan to leave the show, she tries to escape until she is joined in her second dream sequence by human versions of the puppets she adores, each of whom becomes Paul as they dance divinely. After all, Marc had recently declared to her, ""I am the puppets.""

Predictably, it is indeed Paul, the talented but crippled war hero, who is the better choice for Lili who learns for herself, as did Dorothy Gale, that growth can be a painful but ultimately fulfilling journey.",1125187200,42,3244,5.016728624535316
433054,5,6302148332,"Charles Walters is another, like George Sidney, another incredibly talented director whose 1950s work has been for too long overshadowed by his MGM competitors Cukor, Donen and Minnelli.  Walters isn't nearly as flashy as these guys, but where it counts, he's got it all, and as a choreographer, he can design dance films in a way that eluded these other non-dancers.  LILI isn't a musical per se, though years later it inspired the memorable Bob Merrill score for CARNIVAL, but it has more than enough music to qualify it as the kind of picture you leave the theater whistling the tunes from.  And in Leslie Caron they found the right blend of wistfulness and innocence; even her mouth looks bruised, but her eyes light up whenever she sees her darling puppets.

When are they going to put this one out on DVD?  OR its charming counterpart, also with Caron and Walters--THE GLASS SLIPPER?

Kind of a coincidence that both LILI and DARLING LILI, two otherwise unrelated entertainments, have both been kept from DVD?

Mem Ferrer is magnetic playing Berthelet, a man you feel has had an enormous tragedy like Heathcliff.  Leslie Caron appeals to his better nature, and Ferrer makes you feel it.  I wonder if he felt this way about Audrey Hepburn, to whom he was in real life married at this time.  As for Zsa Zsa Gabor, MGM made her look gorgeous here, yes, she looks like a doll, but as Rosalie, she shows signs of spark which warm her up a bit and help to soften her famously blank features.  in her quarrels with the ""Poacher,"" Lili, she actually shows that she can act in character for more than a line or two.  Between this film and MOULIN ROUGE (the original by John Huston), Zsa Zsa Gabor could have gone down in history as being one of the loveliest women ever to grace the screen, but subsequently her nasty, not to say grasping disposition caused her image to plummet way South, and not in a good way.",1113868800,11,1909,4.58235294117647

As the movie unfolded, I didn't see much to interest me but I stuck with it.  This young lady who recently lost her father, came to a distant town to look up one of his old friends.  Maybe he could offer her a job.  Unfortunately he, too, had recently passed away.  She ends up with a group of circus preformers who take her under their wing.  She falls for the magician and I was still unimpressed midway through the movie.  However, she gets involved with the puppet show (and, ultimately, one of the puppeteers).  Their act and her interchange with them gets to be quite compelling.  There is a one-sided love interest that develops which dovetails with the puppet act.  That may sound strange but the point is that this is all skillfully put together.  The movie culminates in an extended fantastical lyrical dance that just blew me away.  I'm no expert on the terpsichoreal arts but I know when it reaches out and touches my emotions.  The costumes, the set, the choreography, and especially the dancers all told the story of a relationship discovering itself.  The ending was a forgone conclusion as the dance fantasy fades back into reality.  Essentially the last third or fourth of the movie was such an artistic achievement that I give the whole film a blanket 5 star rating.

I like checking out older movies especially on channels like TCM.  It has been my experience that I am more apt to discover a great movie by looking back than by looking forward.  They still make great movies these days; just not that often anymore.  There are a lot of classics from the past just waiting to be rediscovered.

433058,5,6302148332,"""Lili"" ranks with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" as one of the three finest motion pictures ever filmed.  Its captivating song, ""Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo,"" ranks with ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""When You Wish Upon a Star,"" ""You'll Never Know,"" and ""It's a Grand Night for Singing"" as one of the five best original movie songs.  Its climactic dream-ballet sequence, in which Lili dances with life-sized versions of four puppets, is rivaled only by the ""Out of My Dreams"" dream-ballet sequence of ""Oklahoma.""  And no actress has ever been more adorable and endearing--or capable--than Leslie Caron is in this movie.
  Not really a musical, Lili is best described as a romantic fable or sophisticated fairy tale.  It tells the story of a naive 16-year-old orphan who joins a carnival.  There she brings success to a lame puppeteer (Mel Ferrer) by interacting with his four puppets.  Her ingenuousness leads her to regard  the puppets as real persons.  Ferrer, though outwardly bitter about the war injury that ruined his career as an acclaimed dancer, shows flashes of inner kindness and humanity: he uses his puppets at one point to infuse joy into a despondent Lili, and he smiles when she isn't looking.  Soon he falls in love with Lili.  But she can't recognize as Ferrer's the tenderness that is revealed only in the puppets.  Repelled by the overt rudeness of ""the angry man,"" Lili becomes infatuated with the carnival's magician, a ladies' man.  When she eventually learns the magician is married, Lili's eyes open.  But the puppeteer's jealousy still clouds her vision.  She decides to leave the carnival.  Her departure precipitates the dream sequence. Here, dancing with the four puppets she has grown to love, she slowly realizes that each character represents a facet of the puppeteer's personality.  Gola the giant, for example, is frightened by girls, so he tries to frighten them; but he is actually cowardly, clumsy, longing to be loved.  Lili's belated recognition that Gola and the others are really Ferrer brings the story to its heartwarming conclusion.
 This imaginative movie is more than a classic.  It is pure enchantment.  Make it your top priority.",1081036800,53,2185,5.027855153203342
433059,5,6302148332,"Just to set the record straight on the source of this magnificent film. It is NOT based on the book ""Love for Seven Dolls"". The book was written and published a few years AFTER the film came out. It is based on a short story by Paul Gallico titled ""The 7 Souls of Clement O""Rielly"" that was published in the Saturday Evening Post. In it the story is of a girl on a TV show acting with puppets who is going to leave, then realizes her love for the puppets is actually for the puppeteer.

It was a sort of take on the wonderful ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" program, but there was never a romance beteen Burr Tillstrom and Fran Allison. In fact, the book, ""Love for 7 Dolls"" is dedicated to Burr Tillstrom (the puppeteer for Kukla) and Fran Allison. So it is obvious Mr. Gallico is acknowledging the inspiration for the stories to the TV show.",1079740800,22,835,4.284810126582278
433060,5,6302148332,"I somehow picked the perfect movie to watch this morning.  Lili.  It's about a puppeteer at a carnival who is bitter because of the hand life has dealt him.  He was a dancer but his leg was injured in the war.  So he performs with several puppets who are really just an extension of himself as he stays hidden below the small stage.  As himself he's constantly bitter, but as the puppets he's able to express happiness.  A beautiful young naive girl played by Leslie Caron comes along and the puppeteer falls in love with her but sees that she is in love with the ""ladies man"" of the carnival, the magician.  The girl thinks of the puppeteer as ""that angry man"" but performs with him as part of the act; she kind of forgets that it's the angry man down below controlling and speaking for most of the puppets.  I thought it was perfect that the puppets all refer to the puppeteer as the boss.  When the girl is sad they ask her why:  ""Oh, is it the boss making you sad again?""  Referring to the puppeteer as ""the boss"".  I just really liked that.
I fall in love with the character Lili.  And I relate so much to this puppeteer who is bitter because he wants something better.  He wants to fall in love with this sweet girl, dance again and just be happy.  You're damn right if you think I got emotional while watching it.  I miss working with genuinely nice and sincere people.  Last week I had a shouting match with the ""new guy"" at my work.  This guy is an arrogant you-know-what.  I'm like the puppeteer and do a few things very well that nobody else at my work can do (it's why I still have a job there).  This guy is a jack of all trades who compensates by doing a little of everything.  He's of the mind that ""we can do without you"".  Funny, he's been there for months and me 8 years but he still thinks he's going to swing getting rid of me.  Cuttthroats?  Yep.  But watching Lili was exactly what I needed to do this morning.  I'm like that puppeteer.  I want the girl and to be happy.  I hope others find this movie so warm like I did this morning.  Oh, I am looking elsewhere for work...heh heh...but still Lili has me feeling much happier that I did last week.
If this film was done in widescreen (the early 1950s was when that started...to counteract Lucy and etc on the TV) let's have a good DVD treatment.  In addition to being pure magic, this movie is therapy!",1068854400,9,2375,4.236607142857143
433061,5,6302148332,"LILI is a movie about a developing romance between a young orphan (Leslie Caron) and a slightly handicapped puppeteer (Mel Ferrer). It is based on a Paul Gallico story depicting life with a carnival. Strong supporting performances by Jean Pierre Aumont and Zsa Zsa Gabor add much to this excellent film.
LILI won an Academy Award in 1953 for Best Scoring of a Dramatic Picture. It also received Oscar nominations for Best Director (Charles Walters), Best Actress (Leslie Caron), Screenplay, Color Cinematography and Color Art Direction. The main competition for awards in 1953 came from STALAG 17, ROMAN HOLIDAY and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.",1048809600,2,638,5.144230769230769

I still hum the song Hi Lilly, Hi Lo and remember most of the words.  This movie had a profound effect on me as a child and I would recommend it to anyone who has children in the age range of 6 to 60.  After seeing Leslie talk to the puppets I had difficulty not believing the puppets were real myself.

7821913,5,6302148332,"Back in the 1950s this was the first Leslie Caron movie I saw after American in Paris.  I took it for a French avant garde production -- a low budget crafted sort of 'prequel' to the Paris film.  It complements the Paris film nicely.  I sought out other films from MGM - Glory Alley and Gaby and became deeply immersed in admiration for her unique presence in films.  Since then I tried to find Lili on VHS, then on DVD and was disappointed to be unable to find it.  Now, with owning it, viewing it on demand through my purchase of it within Amazon library I will never lose it.  My first viewing of their library offer was spot on -- the music, the little show business insights, the inevitable love stories of youth.  It is a perfect little film I had feared lost but now --- rediscovered.  ""A long of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so.

7821914,5,6302148332,"Leslie Caron was a charmer in her films. It's hard to believe that she was plucked out of a French ballet by Gene Kelly, to costar in the Hollywood production and eventual best picture Oscar winner, An American in Paris. It was immediate stardom for her. She was unique as Hollywood thought of her as a French movie actress while France considered her an American film star. As a result, the number of films she made suffered. She was terrific in Gigi, another Oscar winning best picture. Her most challenging role was in The L Shaped Room, which I consider to be her greatest performance. It's too bad this film has been rarely available for viewing.
