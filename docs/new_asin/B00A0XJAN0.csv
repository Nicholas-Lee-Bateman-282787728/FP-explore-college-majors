8545933,5,B00A0XJAN0,"As I expected an invaluable treasure! I was fortunate to attend Chef Andy Matsuda's 3 Day Professional Sushi Class at Hakata Tonton in New York City (Hosted by Chef Koji Hagihara) and I had a sense of what to expect!

The book is a text book not a recipe book! Full of tips and formulas on how to do and take the correct steps and proper sequence in cooking Japanese Cuisine in general and Sushi in particular!

If you are planning to attend the Professional Program in Los Angeles as I am, this is a definite plus in the preparation on becoming a Professional Sushi Chef!

The DVDs are to the point, filmed in a professional kitchen, so expect a few background noises at times but this is the way it is; It actually adds to the flavour!

If you want to have a head start in becoming a Sushi Chef this is definitely a set to have! It will give you an advantage!

This is definitely a Five-Stars-Plus!!!",1354492800,3,902,4.313609467455621
