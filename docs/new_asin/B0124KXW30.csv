7342557,5,B0124KXW30,Love this movie. This has officially become my favorite Nazi movie ever!!,1448409600,3,73,5.166666666666667
7342558,4,B0124KXW30,"Reichsfuhrer SS- Wow! I really liked this flick. The story of this Nazi killer named Heinrich Himmler, who was one of Hitler's most loyal followers. Soon, his loyalty is put to the test when another member of the Nazi Army tells Hitler about Himmler becoming sick while executing POW's. Himmler is sent on a mission to kill a prisoner, this test will push him to limits he never thought he would reach.

Himmler and his men are sent out to a cabin, and Himmler is ordered to kill the female prisoner named Danuta. This woman is tortured, sexually abused, and humiliated. Treated like a pet at first, Himmler soon starts showing the woman a bit of compassion, all the while he is descending into madness.
Himmler is forced to kill Danuta, securing his place in hell.

After he commits suicide, we finally get to see where this feared Nazi henchman ends up, in hell.
We just thought Himmler was evil, Erebus, The Gatekeeper of Hell is going to show him what true evil is all about.

I really got into the whole idea about Himmler not liking to get his hands dirty, and making other people kill for him. To me, this was more psychological. It made you think, it took you on a ride through one of Hitler's most feared men's mind, and it was a total mess.
How can you go from family man to a guy that treats a woman like a pet cat? The dude was crazy.
I felt so sorry for the way that Danuta was treated. Having to eat like an animal, being walked, and made to use the bathroom outside. Just tormented.

Seeing where Himmler ends up is not a nice place. He is shown how awful hell really is. What he did to people while he was alive is nothing compared to what he will face in hell.

This was a fun movie to just sit back and watch, loved the flashbacks, really loved how Erebus looked, that dude was rad! I really liked how everything was pieced together to weave this tale.

It kept me watching, and waiting to see what was going to happen next. I recommend this to all my friends wanting to take a journey into the mind of a Nazi killer.",1448409600,7,2035,4.286458333333333
7342559,4,B0124KXW30,"Reichsfuhrer SS (DVD/Vimeo)  The same independent filmmaker that gave us Operation: Nazi Zombies a few years back is back at again with another Nazi film that involves Heinrich Himmler on about a $25,000 budget. The film is about how Himmler became a murdering Nazi bastard and meets the gatekeeper of hell after his suicide in 1945. While with the gatekeeper of hell Himmler goes through his past of what started him on his incredible murderous path. The crew does an amazing job with costumes, use of locations, dcor, and even the gatekeeper of hell. If I didn't tell you the budget of this flick most viewers would guess that the budget would be more like $200, 000 or $300,000 because of how authentic things look. The crew, the actors, and filmmaker go all out in this bad ass entertaining film about Himmler getting what he deserved in the end. I love watching independent movies that pay attention to detail when it comes to pictures, flags, etc. when movies are set in a certain time period and they should be proud of this project. I give this flick 3 out of 4 stars and more about this new release can be found at:  https://www.facebook.com/RFSSMovie?fref=ts .

7342561,5,B0124KXW30,Great nazi movie in the perspective of SS leader Heinrich Himmler. It takes a look at some of the events that caused him to be the crazed mudering nazi he was.

7342592,5,B0124KXW30,Angelina Leigh is amazing in her representation of an oppressed and sexualized woman taken advantage of in the 3rd Reich.,1461196800,2,121,5.1
7342593,1,B0124KXW30,"Absolutely horrible film. Extremely low budget and terrible nonsensical script. Acting was atrocious. Most all of the actors had American accents and sounded like they were reading off of scripts without any emotion. Very wooden acting. The Polish female concentration camp prisoner spoke with an American accent and was too physically healthy to have been in a concentration camp. She even had eye makeup on.

The Himmler character had a very American accent with no acting ability at all. And his glasses were all wrong for Himmler. I was at least expecting a portrayal of Himmler to show some of the evil activities he had been involved with such as administering the Death Camps and the Gestapo. Instead, we get a cheesy scene where he is personally ordering the execution of a few Russian (I'm guessing from the uniforms) soldiers after he unsuccessfully  tries to get information out of a Russian officer. This was a pathetically cheesy and lame depiction of a pathetic interrogation attempt.

Even the demons in Hell aren't particularly menacing. They talk and talk and talk, but are all talk and no action.  This movie is not even worth a rental.",1455148800,6,1154,4.93298969072165

7342595,2,B0124KXW30,"I'm sorry I bought this!  I was intrigued by the summary, but ultimately didn't care for the entire story, staging, props and acting.  Some of the SS officers didn't even care to trim their hair to a military style haircut, c'mon go for (slight) realism even for a small budget film.  Most WWII You Tube short HD films are way better than this.",1451692800,5,344,4.428571428571429

8725274,5,B0124KXW30,"Amazing Actresses, Angelina Leigh, Tina Krause, & Tammy Jean, Shed their Goddess-Like Beauty to Conquer the World of ""Reichsfuhrer SS"" !!!
  David B. Stewart III exhibits an Incredible Performance as ""Reichsfuhrer Himmler"", the Nazi Husband, Slowly Sinking into the Life-Style of Depravity, Mass-Murder, & Self-Indulgence ! John Martineau is Terrifying as ""Erebus"", Himmler's Demon Torturer; Along with his assistant, Tammy Jean, whose Beauty is UnRecognizable; but Her Perfect Proportions are easily discernible, under Her Rotting Demon Flesh !
  The Always Entertaining & Magnificently Stacked & Beautiful Tina Krause is Perfectly Cast as ""Greta"", the Sadistic Nazi Interrogator, along with the Lovely Kelly Weston, as Her Counterpart ""Helga"" ! The Rest of the Cast is Equally Awesome; BUT ...........
Angelina Leigh Steals the SpotLight Portraying ""Danuta"" the Strong Polish Woman Beaten into Waif-Like Submission by the Diligently Ruthless Nazi Occupiers !
  This Intense Film is a Must-See for Lovers of Horror, Great Acting, or Simply a Great Story that is Wonderfully Choreographed !!!",1474848000,3,1092,5.709876543209877

8725278,5,B0124KXW30,"Most horror movies nowadays are boring clones of other horror movies. Finally here's an original idea that is well executed. It has a great cast (including Playboy model Angelina Leigh who does get naked) and great effects. The story is fantastic and the art design is pleasing to the eyes. I wish more low budget indie horror were this good but unfortunately they are not. Give this film a look, you won't regret it.",1465689600,3,417,4.648648648648648
