3564273,5,B001F51MI8,"great video--you can expect great material from the creators of these dvds (they also have pistol, fitness, combat medic, and 2 man operations videos). basically shows you everything you need to know to properly handle an assault rifle--they even show you how they modify the weapon with simple household items (cotton cloth, string, nylon strap, diesel fuel) to maximize its effectiveness in the field. also a bikini babe unloads a full clip out of an AR 15 at the end of the video which definitely added a nice touch!",1278115200,,519,4.842696629213483
3564274,5,B001F51MI8,"Israeli Counter Terror Rifle Course is one the first best rifle training DVD I see until now. The instructor is explaining clear, and teaching well the techniques exactly how they are taught in the IDF. I am very glad I purchased this DVD and I recommend it to the rifle lovers.",1275091200,,278,4.470588235294118
3564275,5,B001F51MI8,"Great overall DVD. First i got the fitness and medic DVD about a year ago. Then I recently got this one. The DVD is motivating, makes you want to pick up your M4 and go to the nearest out door range and start punching paper. The structure of the DVD follows like a stand alone course progressing from the basics like stance and points of contact to the advanced stuff like use of cover and weapon transfers. I will get the other ones and write a review for those as well. But I would recommend this group of producers and the DVDs in this set. I like this authors work and think the pricing is right for this industry.",1269734400,,618,4.201680672268908
3564276,5,B001F51MI8,"This DVD was to the point and concise, really easy to follow instruction. good sound quality, great location, good filming and camera angles.  Lots of concepts and information. Need to watch it a few times to get it all in.",1269043200,2,223,4.575
3564277,5,B001F51MI8,"I am a beginner with the M4 and have years of pistol experience. I watched the Pistol DVDs and was impressed so when I wanted to buy an M-16 I got the DVD to learn the basics. I would say that the DVD is filmed a little different then the others in that film and edit quality is a little better. The content is based off a lot of the same principals as the first DVDs I saw. So it all flowed smoothly for me. The end of the DVD has a ""list of principals for combat with a rifle in the Israeli method"" This list is awesome and very useful. The DVD is great for a beginner, but I would also say it is good for experienced shooters who want to see the Israeli approach, and again not to many courses out there on ""Israeli Rifle""",1268870400,2,725,3.938775510204082
3564278,5,B001F51MI8,"top notch material, great filming, good sound quality, good location. entertaining and informative to watch. I would recommend it. Very thorough weapon transition section.",1268697600,3,171,6.166666666666667
3564279,5,B001F51MI8,"After I watched several other DVDs on the subject of rifle combat and military tactics, I watched this Israeli DVD. The instruction was good and starts from a very basic level and goes into more advanced things as the DVD continues. The great thing about the DVD was the fact that they seem to have thought of everything, the instructor elaborates on the nuances that many other programs overlook or perhaps take for granted. Additionally there are no other ""Israeli rifle"" DVDs on the market, almost all of them are about pistol combat. Overall a great wealth of knowledge, filming is good, instructor is clear and precise, filming location is cool. This was the first one I bought from this series and then I got the rest of them which where equally as interesting.",1268611200,7,767,4.731343283582089
3564280,3,B001F51MI8,"Normally when you have some finely crafted, highly acclaimed foreign film like ""ISRAELI COUNTER TERROR RIFLE COURSE"" and the American studios get a hold of the rights they screw it up.

While the original brought a gritty realism to the topic, I have to defer to ""Zohan"" for the superior soundtrack and better babes.

8301006,1,B001F51MI8,"Poor quality video, old techniques from the early 2000s, not much in depth teaching. And some middle aged woman in a bikini at the end shooting an M4 randomly....

How can these other reviewers be giving anything more than 1-3 stars, boggles my mind.

Not trying to be a hater, but Garret Machine or whatever his name is, also has an arrogance in his teaching that wore on me as the video progressed.  Maybe thats just me.

Save your money, don't buy this video.  The Magpul series are so much better.",1516665600,,501,4.461538461538462

8301010,4,B001F51MI8,"Compared to some of the other training DVD's (Magpul, Viking Tactics, etc.) currently on the market, this one is both short and has a lower production value (wind noise and camera crew in the shots on occasions).  Overall the material is decent, and the block of how to train on Israeli style room clearance is worth $11's I paid for the DVD by itself.  I would not recommend this DVD for someone looking for basic instruction, this is really more a niche product that provides information on how a particular military trains their troops for a particular set of circumstances.  if you're after this info, it's great.  If you're not, then it probably won't be what you're after.",1448755200,5,678,4.720338983050848
8301011,1,B001F51MI8,I question the instructions of this course. Filming quality not very Good. And what's the deal with the blonde in a bikini firing an AR-15 at the very end of the CD ?,1443657600,,166,4.0606060606060606
