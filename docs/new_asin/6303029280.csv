Small gang in poor area all fighting for survival and all trying to take over the blood donation racket which preys on dock workers looking for drinking. Alot of comedy, a little gang action and worth the time to watch it.",1311033600,,325,4.620689655172414
7834616,4,6303029280,"Oshima Nagisa has become one of Japan's premiere directors and The Sun's Burial is one of his earliest and strongest films. The movie centers on a woman named Hanako who a prostitute and cutthroat entrepreneur trying to  survive the Kawagasaki slum of post-war Osaka. Oshima shows, without  pretention, the heart of the slum and the gangs that control it. One of the  gangs is a right-wing group lead by a man known only as The Agitator and  another gang is lead by a man named Shin. Both of their storylines are tied  together through the character of Hanako who schemes and manipulates both  of them for simple survival.
Another key character is a member of Shin's  gang, Takeshi, who repeatedly tries to escape from the gang and eventually  becomes involved with Hanako. Oshima uses him as an innocent, someone to  show how jaded and harsh Hanako has become in order to make a living in  such a place. Oshima's cinematography also magnifies that harshness.  Considered shocking at the time, his camera captures violence perfectly,  not only in actions but in color as well. Throughout, the film displays  beautiful shades of yellows in sand, oranges and reds in fire to emphasize  a setting sun and the consequent rise of a new Japan in its place. As one  might expect, The Sun's Burial heads towards a destructive finish that  emphasizes the theme the title suggests: not only the burial of the sun, an  image associated with traditional Japan, but the consequent rise of a new  Japan in its place.
Even if you're not a follower of Japanese cinema,  don't rule The Sun's Burial out. The film has as much depth as the rich  colors it displays and should appeal to any fan of solid storytelling and  detailed characters. Although not as brutal as some films found today, it  was among the most challenging of its time and can be appreciated just as  much, if not more, today.",962409600,8,1877,4.707692307692308
