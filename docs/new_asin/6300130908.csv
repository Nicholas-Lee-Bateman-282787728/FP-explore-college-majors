7804269,1,6300130908,"I expected an instructional student/teacher style approach beginning with an outline of the different turkey callers and their use in the spring, followed by some time executing/perfecting some fundamental calls i.e., yelps, purrs, putts, etc., with each type.  I would like to know how to  properly ""fit"" a mouth call, for example, and how to make some  basic calls and then proceed to executing 2 or 3 more advanced calls. I  would like to know how/when to chalk a box call.  What about weather i.e.,  best vs. tollerable conditions?  When should you stay home?  Mr. Braungardt  is no doubt one of the best Wild Turkey callers in the U.S.; but, this  video was a disappointment...!  I am a big fan of  Walter Payton and football, but, I really only wanted to learn the  fundamentals of calling a Spring Gobbler.  Far too much time is spent on  small talk i.e., gobbler tracks ""you"" don't see, feathers from a  fight, with no close up, pros/cons of seats, asking Walter Payton ""Did  you hear him gobble"" etc.  Too much advertisment for his blind. There  was so much ""preview"" on bass fishing, I thought they had sent me  the wrong video for a while.  I really didn't expect the focus to be on bow  hunting. Don't expect more than approx. 2-3 minutes of this 51 minute video  to be on actual calling of a wild turkey gobbler and most of that is for a  very experienced (advanced) mouth call user! After watching this video, I  still have no clue ""how to"" begin calling a spring gobbler, let  alone executing (what I consider) those exceptional multiple pitch or toned  calls provided by Mr. Braungardt with a mouth call!  He is no doubt an  exceptional caller, maybe ""the best;"" however, this video tape  had very little value to me. I'll ask a trusted friend for a recommendation  before ordering another hunting/fishing video!",956534400,7,1828,4.689873417721519
