2869946,1,B000RO6JZ4,"Plot holes you can drive a truck through, they try to get too political with this season, you hardly get the same sense of danger, or secrecy as in the first.  The wife angle is still annoying and I'm not sure why Mamet wrote a lot of the episodes they way he did.  I would not recommend it.",1191369600,7,291,4.0
2869947,5,B000RO6JZ4,"I was so impressed with the first season that I had to get the second season on DVD as well.  Even better without the commercial interruptions.
Anyone that wants good action and drama in a TV series this would be a good one to follow.  Season 3 just started on air and it's been incredable so far just after the first episode!  We have another winner!

2869948,2,B000RO6JZ4,"I'm looking forward to the set, but with major caveats; there were some eye-rollingly bad aspects of Season 2. Grey's fling with the Israeli intelligence babe was utterly moronic; several times during the episode, the local terrorist thugs who have occupied the same space as Grey and his gal are seen bending over praying, or fast asleep. Wouldn't a stone cold killer like Grey waste all these guys with one clip from his pistol? He'd just as likely kill them all by hand, easily, right? Or the ""coin switch"" episode; EXACTLY the same plot device re: Molly getting burned by the real estate fraud last season. And, speaking of which, since these ARE the most hard-wired, intel-gathering, resourceful soldiers on the planet, you don't think they could manage to track down and take down a few small-time grifters?

On the other hand...some of the best episodes in the series were found this Season, including the defense of the firebase, with the attendant command dramas and spectacular firefights. Sensitive, nuanced portrayal of the ""enemy"" cleric as well.

I DVR'd them all, but if there are some worthwhile special features, well, who knows?",1190073600,8,1146,4.994764397905759
2869949,5,B000RO6JZ4,So glad CBS is releasing season two before the third season starts.  I got my friend hooked on this show and she really wanted to see season two.  The Unit is still going strong and can't wait for the third season. The actors aren't bad too look at either.  Fast enjoyable hour.  Enjoy,1183334400,27,285,4.320754716981132

I can't support companies that will not support my president. We put up with 0'bama you can put up with Trump.

2870035,5,B000RO6JZ4,"The Unit has gotten rave reviews from former and present soldiers and their families, for its authenticity.  I would add that it seems to be a morally nuanced look at not only the sanctioned actions of a highly trained counter-terrorist force, but also the personal lives of the soldiers who serve in that force and their families.  The series may seem a bit dated compared to more current entertainments employing special effects for shock and awe.  But it is largely true to life, even down to the political interference that the military teams face in their operations.

This and Season 1 are well worth seeing.",1473811200,2,614,4.819047619047619

Went to continue watching it last night and now costs $1.99 per episode. There is no rerun TV show worth that much. Most of the movies aren't even worth that. That is one thing I REALLY dislike about Prime, the cost of rerun TV and the cost of new releases. The fact you have to purchase a movie to watch it.

Scott Foley really makes this a much better program as does the guy with the piercing blue eyes and reddish hair (forget his name obviously).  The woman with the blond hair (forget name again) seems out of place to me and her acting/emotions don't fit the script.  And again, like Season 1, the same settings are used for different parts of the world.  These pull the show down from a 5 to a 4.  It's definitely worth watching however, and I'm binge watching because I want to know what happens with the characters from episode to episode.  I like spy thrillers and this one doesn't disappoint.

2870783,4,B000RO6JZ4,"Show as a whole is a good show . The bond of respect, camaraderie, internal political manipulation with upper chain is all well done for the most part.
I would take this on an episode by episode basis. They aren't all great but there are some great ones.

When it started the relationships of the operators with their wives was well done - it revealed the challenges of a civilian (wife) trying to deal with a hard core soldier while living a routine day to day life, while somewhat well contrasting it with a soldier who deals with the fragility of life daily, at a level far more acute than just a routine soldier, due to the nature of his missions. This difficult relationship, I believe, is a large part of PTSD. The UNIT's attempt to show this was a decent effort at times.
HOWEVER, apparently the writers lost their way because the entire involvement of ""the wives"" subsequently degrades to garbage ""filler"" material, PTA( yeah, like grade school) level, uninteresting and completely unnecessary material in this and later seasons. To the point where I began to fast forward whenever I saw any of the wives show up on screen. This stigma created a ""self'cannibalized"" event for the show because although there may have been portions that were good that included the wives, I never saw them and am okay with it.

I don't think the quality of good TV or film should ever be compromised or traded for quantity.",1454284800,2,1413,4.648

2871143,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Amazon suggested The Unit based upon my viewing of Strike Back. Although both series feature special forces operatives performing extremely dangerous missions, the 2 shows differ in significant ways.

The Unit shows special forces missions. But it also features story lines from the wives & girlfriends back home. We get an impression of what it is like to run a household when one parent is away much of the time; when the man must not share most aspects of his work with his wife; when each & every mission can results in the man's death. In this way, the show is much more balanced and lifelike than other series like this. We see the man throw himself into harm's way; we admire his courage and his devotion to service. Back home we see the wife trying to make ends meet on sparse NCO pay. When one of the men gets killed, we see the wives cope with the enormous financial burdens this loss brings.

The mission aspect also differs from the usual. Even in the midst of extreme danger, the operatives are evaluating their environment, data from many sources, they are making decisions based upon thinking the situation through. These missions are not just bang-bang shoot-em-up. We participate in planning; we see what can go wrong; then we watch the operatives figure out what went wrong and what would work best, then implementing it. We see the courage it takes to do this type of work; but we also see how intelligent and resourceful special ops teams must be to survive and succeed in this arena.

The acting is first rate in this series. Especially the main star, Dennis Haysbert. His deep voice and solid presence gives a calm base for the incredible danger the men face.

The series creator, frequent writer and director, is distinguished screenwriter & director, David Mamet. He maintains high standards of quality in the writing. This is not just an adventure series. It is a very human series about people coping in extreme situations. I haven't seen any articles about advisors to the series; but there must be high level consulting from Delta Force operatives because there is a verisimilitude in mission profiles and methods. Also in family life situations.

I recommend this series to both men & women. It has something valuable to offer both.",1441152000,,2261,4.772378516624041

2871212,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Often, when a series reaches a 2nd season, the plot becomes harder for writers to keep it at the level of the first season. Well, In season 2 of The Unit, that was not the case. Every episode was fresh and intriguing. Mamet, the writer and creator of the show has done a great job with the parallel plot which is the story of their wives at home and what they are facing. It never gets boring and I believe each episode has a theme that springs out of the combination of these to parallel plots. I loved this season just as much as season 1.",1440374400,6,541,4.113207547169812

2871618,5,B000RO6JZ4,"The Unit is a great show. Often criticized for being to far from reality. Usually by former or active duty soldiers and they would be right. However much disinformation is in the show there is actually quite a bit of truth too. You just have to read between the lines. 1st special actions group is the fictional counterpart to the army's non-fictional Combat Applications Group aka the unit/ 1st operational detachment delta/ delta force. This is no Chuck Norris action flick. It is instead a  drama about the men who ""we"" call when the wolf is at the door. To do the tasks we as a nation can't be seen doing. Assassinations/ renditions/ asset recovery etc. Their primary function of course is counter terrorism. At which they are unmatched by almost(sas) all other nations. Back on base their wives hold down the fort. And because of the clandestine nature of their husbands work, they can only trust each other. Loose lips don't only sink ships. They can sink careers as well as get you a freshly folded flag delivered to your door. These women are a team just as their husbands are while deployed. Great show some inaccuracies but easily overlooked. Cancelled before it could have wrapped up on its own. Maybe Amazon could take a page out of Netflix's book and resurrect this show so it can get a proper ending. Jonas's cover as an allstate agent has gone on long enough.",1431734400,2,1374,4.654320987654321

They took a fabulous format from Season 1 and turned it into a hodgepodge of hackneyed topical political gobbledegook. I couldn't think of a better way to ruin a good thing. America has real enemies which require real sacrifices by real people, but Season 2 decided to focus on politically correct stereotypes that are just plain boring. I truly wish I had skipped the entire season, but to my own discredit, I actually watched half of them before giving up hope.",1428019200,,553,4.595959595959596

I have seen most of the TV shows like Band of Brothers, Pacific etc., and I can say what is different about this show is that the environment changes every episode. Today you are protecting a Prince in America, tomorrow you find yourself in Africa.

I do believe some unit like this exists in the military in order to keep this country safe, and they do their job pretty well. I like that Dennis Haysbert is playing the main role. It suits him to give orders, even though I am used to see him as President David Palmer in 24.

I started to watch this show, because I had some free time, and had nothing to do for the moment. Now I am attracted to it, and when I have free time, I watch this instead of something else.",1422748800,,781,4.098039215686274

2872369,5,B000RO6JZ4,"""The Unit"" is one of the best TV programs we have seen in a very long time. After watching all of Season 1 and 10 episodes from Season 2, we can hardly wait for the next episode. The idea of a Unit of ex special forces soldiers performing off-books missions is good, but the element of their wives being a key part of the show makes it uniquely interesting. The acting is excellent from all the cast and each one's character is well developed, so it's almost like you really get to know them all. Dennis Haysbert is especially good as the unit leader - a very commanding character who his men would do anything for. You can feel the comraderi among the team members, a key element to mission success. Production quality is excellent as the settings look like the real thing, not just some cheesy Hollywood back lot. I don't want to give away too much about The Unit, but I will say this is the best tv since The Sopranos.",1412812800,,921,4.329479768786127

The show consistently highly all of the things I look for in an action-packed, suspense filled show.  There are no peers.  This is a combination of Bourne and Mission Impossible.  The show highlights the elegance of teamwork, sheer intelligence of each player but it tastefully does so without casting someone as ""the ideal"" agent equipped with a super-intelligence.

2872397,1,B000RO6JZ4,"Just stopped watching ""The Unit"". First season was ok...I was intrigued for a while. Started season 2 and ended it when the one episode was about a love letter written by a soldier from WWII addressed to his gay partner, Midge who the viewers thought was his wife's nickname until the last 10 seconds of the episode.

The deal is that the part of the episode was so irrelevant to the show that it shouldn't have been placed in the episode at all. I think the writers were looking for an ""interesting"" punch line. They succeeded but it definitely was an unnecessary one. I was hoping this show would be more like ""24"" but I found that almost every episode is nearly independent from each other. Very few details are actually carried over from one episode to another.",1411689600,2,765,4.543478260869565
2872398,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Much more engaging program than I expected. I don't know how realistic it is, but it made me think a lot more about military life which is very far from my personal experience.

2872498,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Really, really enjoying this show thoroughly. It appears to be filmed on location in different locales across the world; appears too authentic many times to be filmed on a studio lot. There's always a caption as to where it's being filmed at the beginning of the episode. If I could have, I would have given 4.5 stars. It's not perfect, but then again it's for entertainment purposes. For instance, it seems that generally the men of ""The Unit"" kill the bad guys pretty much all the time, except for very rare instances when one of ""The Unit"" men get shot or even rarer yet, killed. Be prepared to view military action because there's lots of that and it's quite crafty in strategy because these are covert operations depicting some torture, for example, but there's also time devoted to stories related to the families of the men. Each episode features a blend of action and stories revolving around the family members interactions. The group of men and their wives are a very tight knit community and the characters are developed well. I think Season 2 was probably even better than Season 1, which itself was very good and engaging. I'm on Season 3 now, and it's still gripping, the acting is very good, and the shows are well written. By the way, I normally do not enjoy movies featuring wars and action on the military front, but this show has me hooked and perhaps it's somewhat due to these being covert operations.",1407888000,,1422,4.669322709163347

2872647,5,B000RO6JZ4,This is just a great series in terms of showing what our clandestine forces deal with in their lives. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who has interest in military,1403481600,,173,4.612903225806452

2872650,5,B000RO6JZ4,I never missed an episode when it was on. Being a 69 year old Vietnam vet I enjoy seeing these guys in action. But what this series does better than most is show the powerful camaraderie among these men. And the wives too. They ALL have each other's back.,1403481600,,255,4.224489795918367

2872653,4,B000RO6JZ4,I don't subscribe to HBO.  Some of it's programs are worth watching.  This is one of them.  How many years behind is Amazon?  I guess I will find out - will that be at the cost of several dollars an issue?,1403308800,,205,3.926829268292683
2872654,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Very good action and adventure. It seems very unrealistic, it is good entertainment. Can sometimes seem kind of A-Team-ish. If just a fraction of what the show is true, it is amazing what some of the men and women do for our country is extraordinary.

 Not a big fan of some of  the soap opera relationships they portray among the wives. Most of their drama seems far fetched and only thrown in to create filler for the show.",1403308800,,425,4.423076923076923

2872662,4,B000RO6JZ4,"I like that this show obviously consults a military adviser. Not the typical ""military-ish"" show where they call mags ""clips"", they take multiple hits and keep on chugging through, or they use super cliche one liners from every other military-type hack movie.

2872665,5,B000RO6JZ4,I like this type of tv show. The season seems to connect better from episode to episode. I also like how they wrap up season 2.,1403049600,,127,3.923076923076923

2872668,4,B000RO6JZ4,"While  not quiet as fresh as Season One, the stories are reasonably good and well acted.  They are fairly light on the peripheral drama nonsense and some of the special forces stuff is interesting.  Don't get me wrong, there is a degree of ridiculousness in the range of activities they engage in, including  frequent undercover ""role-playing"" and fairly regular brushes with world leaders (despite the fact that they are all NCOs).  However, if your benchmarks are Scandal and Nashville, I'll take this any day.  Season One was better, but Season Two is still well worth watching.",1403049600,,581,5.0

2872671,5,B000RO6JZ4,This is a program that keeps you wondering where it will go next.  I think they have covered the women's aspect really well.  The men  play good roles too.,1402963200,,155,4.275862068965517

2872674,3,B000RO6JZ4,"The first season started out OK but this season doesn't seem to have stories of the same quality. Some of the stories go into very average direction. I am also getting tired of these "" heroic"" men being so weak morally.",1402876800,,219,4.365853658536586

2872678,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Absolutely entertaining series. A real shame to have not continued. It is of a similar quality to NCIS, just grittier. The writing became a little weaker in the final season.

2872712,4,B000RO6JZ4,My boyfriend and I are hooked on this show. It's a little far fetched but fun to watch. The Unit members and the action are great. The only downfall is the wives side story. Gets annoying. If it wasn't for them I would give this 5 stars.,1401667200,,237,4.0638297872340425

2872721,4,B000RO6JZ4,"Loved this show from when it first came out. I am currently going through the seasons for the third or fourth time, but am noticing that there are missing scenes. And not just forgettable, unnecessary scenes, but some of the most emotionally impacting. For instance, in the season 1 finale original, the colonel's new wife shields Tiffy and is shot during an attack by terrorists looking for revenge. Totally missing, although in season 2, you see the bullet scars on her back. In the episode ""Sub-conscience"", season 2, a mid-eastern woman ally accompanying the unit on a mission in Iran is trapped under debris. They must leave her to avoid death and international chaos when Iranian soldiers arrive. She and Mack had formed a bond during the mission, and she asked Mack to kill her, knowing she would be tortured and killed. Even though this is a huge moral dilemma, and something horrible that Mack would have to live with, he does so. Again, totally missing in the streaming version. These are powerful scenes and the show is diminished by removing them. Why would they do that? Who is deciding which scenes to cut? Very frustrating. I read another reviewer on a different show say the same thing. If streaming video continues this type of editing, I will be cancelling subscriptions. Still a very entertaining show, but I would recommend getting the dvd's.",1401494400,,1362,4.849785407725322

2872735,4,B000RO6JZ4,I liked this season's action. Tough situations handled by tough rangers. Good action scenes with realistic stunts make it almost as good as a high-cost movie.,1401408000,,158,5.115384615384615

2872747,4,B000RO6JZ4,I really enjoyed the show. The story line at times (towards the end) was a little disjointed. Overall great show.,1401148800,,113,4.7

2872756,5,B000RO6JZ4,"The entire series, ""The Unit"" is a great show all the way around. It's not only informative regarding our country's Special Op's Unit actually does, but is wonderfully written, acted, and directed. There have been several series, however ""The Unit"" has been the only one not written from the wives prospective. Both my husband and I enjoy watching ""The Unit"" and have watched it several times. It's
definitely not written as a soap opera. ""The Unit"" is one of my favorites. I would highly recommend it for anyone over the age of 12 and over. Both men and women alike. If you're looking for a great show to watch, try not to miss this one. I highly recommended it.",1400976000,,663,4.579831932773109

2872768,5,B000RO6JZ4,"At first I thought some of the characters in the show were bad actors but after episode 3 I really started to see a great story line develop. There is a mixture of action, love, and intense moments so that's what kept me coming back. As the story progressed I felt like I could identify with each Army wife considering I am a Marine's wife. I am however kind of bummed that they were not able to continue their show to season 4 because of cost.",1400630400,,444,4.174418604651163

2872777,5,B000RO6JZ4,I love this show.  I don't see how I missed it for 4 years without finding out about it.  I have been on a multi week binge of catch up and I am loving every moment of it (well most of the moments anyway).  I did find that it started to drag a little in a couple of episodes but then no show is perfect.  Overall very entertaining.,1400544000,,331,3.823529411764706
2872778,5,B000RO6JZ4,They maintain two compelling stories at the same time. Believable characters and situations. (Your demand for a longer review is annoying and uncalled for. Not everyone has to go on and on to make a point.),1400544000,,206,4.75

2872781,5,B000RO6JZ4,I loved The Unit from its inception but do to work and other scheduling conflicts missed many episodes.  I know being a retired Marine that many of the scenarios are a bit over the top but that doesn't make them any less enjoyable.  I think the acting is great and watching these characters stay true but also grow in depth and complexity is just fun.  Recommend to anyone who likes military genre or just good fast moving drama.,1400544000,,429,4.4743589743589745
2872782,5,B000RO6JZ4,Not a lot of slow filler BS like most series...Seeems to improve as seasons go on. Also not a lot of cliff hangers to suck you in. Great show.,1400457600,,142,3.9310344827586206

2872792,5,B000RO6JZ4,I can't believe this series is NOT in the local video store. THE story line for each episode is builds upon itself and had me watching at least two episodes at a time. The producers did an outstanding job portraying Eric Haney's story. I enjoyed how the story incorporated both the operators' side of their work as well as the lives of their wives!

The good guys get wounded, deal with problems, worry about family and making ends meet. The families deal with the husbands/dads being away. There are a good array of toys too - weapons, aircraft, vehicles, and high-tech gadgets.  The shows flow, so the story lines continue forward show to show.

Its got a great cast - Scott Foley is one of the main characters (he plays Jake on Scandal) also the actor that played one of the Presidents on '24' is the lead of the Unit.....its pretty face paced - only thing I don't like is that they leave things hanging and never come back to them the following episode so you're just wondering what ever happened...............many episodes feel like they are ""stand alones"" yet there needs to be some answers.

Moreover, actors that are passably in shape to be called elite commandos. With that said and in mind - this is a sweet, action packed, drama filled - tv-series. Unfortunate there were only 4-seasons. It give's great insight into what these elite commandos could possibly go through in a, ""standard"" day. (i.e) fight off terrorist that were going to harm a baseball stadium - then be home that night watching that same baseball stadium with family. And, never being able to talk about it with his family.

Their brave, loyal yet independent wives matter-of-factly handle homefront and family matters as well as their own jobs. Segments of each episode portray soldiering/spying balanced with family/personal parts of each character's life circumstances. Although voilent death prevails during the army-mission segments, dying is handled with dignity for some characters, even some ""enemies.""

Not only is there a bunch of action but the side plots and stories are great on their own. You will get to know about The Unit members family and how everything they do affects their everyday lives.

You really get involved with the people and situations that they are in.  You get a real understanding on all sides, in respect to how the government (Department of Justice) and the Unit members themselves are perceived.  You see that these people are true patriots assigned to do the dirty work, but they are not appreciated or backed up by the powers that put them there.  Maybe this is why the show did not lasts more than 4 seasons, because it was too controversial and didn't portray our powers to be in a favorable light.  Whatever the reason, I feel that the points to be made were made in the most truthful way that it could be made for primetime TV.

The action is mostly portrayed as difficult, dirty and dangerous (as it is in reality) but sometimes I think the soldiers/actors look far too 'pretty' after the action in complete and we never see an episode when their equipment fails, guns jam, a storm knocks out communications, etc. This show could really benefit from a researcher with actual, real-life ARMY experience where the families are concerned as well. My pet peeve with this show: PLEASE, for goodness sake (!) STOP referring to ARMY installations as 'Bases"" - Army facilities are correctly referred to as a POST or a FORT.

The actors seem a much more familiar with their roles both as the role of the character and the role the character plays within the series.  It takes some understanding to accurately portray military personnel if you've no first hand knowledge.

The episodes have yet to become either redundant or so bizzare that they are truly improbable as often happens after an initial series.  Once the good ideas are used up, then what?

It conveys patriotism, strong work ethics,  loyalty and a number of other ""old fashioned"" concepts which underpin the show as it moves through the normal human frailties and challenges of life in a warrior culture.

The female actors, with their meddlesome antics and weekly pseudo-dramas, are an annoying distraction. I suggest you fast forward through the wives pseudo-drama dramas of the week and stick with The Units mission and youll enjoy the series a lot more. Unlike so many other series, the female actors in this series actually detract from the mission focus that makes the show so enjoyable.",1396224000,,525,5.176470588235294

One the cute girl who is goth. her I love though her character look is stupid for an adult. then we have the midget who heads a unit when we all know that there is a hight requirement in all services. 5'7"" Anyone who has ever had anyone they know in any service of the USA knows this. But they think we are stupid. now this show wants us to believe that they hired a short overweight, little toad who is in the cia?????? and dirt diver does not kill or beat the crap out of a whore who has tried to harm his marrage and his unit. But pays the bitch off. that is a hell of a peace of ass he got to pay a roll of hundreds for. lets be for real here. no service man paid off any whore who put his family and unit in jeaperdy , I am a woman who does not believe in a man hitting a woman. but that one even I would have beat the crap out of and then said hey next time your dead.

2873026,4,B000RO6JZ4,"Enjoyed Season 2 of The Unit immensely, just as I have since I viewed the first episode of season 1.  This is my kind of program  It covers all  areas of covert operations and the families left behind.  The writers demonstrate how the wives and children are coping or not coping, with the spouse's deployment.

Some cope much better than others, but to my surprise, Kim the youngest, a wife with a 5 yo daughter and 9 mon old son, seems to really have her head on her shoulders.  This may be attributed to her life as an ""army brat.""

Kim's natural ability to  deal with the stress of a military life, is admirable.

Each wife is always available to the others, whether to help in celebrating or lending a shoulder for  comfort  Their understanding of what is necessary when one marries a military man is remarkable.

Then ""The Unit,"" and each of the men who have chosen to become one of its members; is a compilation of men who become heroes, men who love their country and their families. They walk out of their homes and focus their minds on the needs at hand.  But never losing sight of the ones they left at home.

One and all they are military men, who are not afraid to show their sensitive sides. This is what endears them to me.

I am a Retired Licensed Master of Social Work, who specialized in psychiatric care.  I am enjoying viewing all of the season's of ""The Unit"" on Amazon.com without having to wait for ""next week.""",1395964800,,1433,4.391634980988593

The actors were good and delivered believable performances but they didn't have good scripts which made the series seem to be very low budget and nothing like the quality of 24, Person of Interest or Homeland.

The mission-in-the-field stories tend to be better than the stuff-back-home stories. When both stories follow a similar theme, the show really clicks. Nicely balanced views of the military. Some anti-military protesters are shown, and their point-of-view is expressed. But the soldiers and their missions are treated with respect. Not overly glorified.

You also get to listen to Eric Haney, a founding member of Delta Force, give his insight on how accurate the scenes are. He worked with the producers to make sure everything was accurate. The cases for all 4 seasons either had a crack or in one case the part that holds the discs was broke away from the flip joint (discs are together like pages of a book, if it was a book the pages would be torn from the spine) when I got it so now one side just flops around.",1355961600,,625,4.048387096774194

Season 2 seems to have lost some of the believability factor.

""Sub-Conscious"" has to be the worst episode yet.  Sure it's a TV show, not a documentary...  but even I, a non-military viewer, can be bothered by:

* A submarine extraction of agents handled by an Army unit and not Navy SEALS?  Isn't this what SEALS train for?
* Who would give an Army sergeant effective command of the submarine itself?
* Jonas gives operational orders to the submarine commander and crew.  He knows the correct tactical response to a naval tactical situation better than a trained submarine crew.
* The crew continually calls ""dive! dive!"" and floods the ballast tanks but they are already submerged and just changing  depth.
* Unit members operate equipment on board a submarine.  Even sonar tracking gear?  Where did they train to do that?  It's not even a U.S. boat!
* When they swim out of the submarine unit members have no rebreathers or Scuba gear.  They hold their breath if you can believe it!  They also go through a bottom hatch and then are shown exiting from the top of the sub",1264982400,7,1096,4.616580310880829

2873123,3,B000RO6JZ4,"I thought the first season was very good. However, Season Two seems to have been afflicted with a bit of political correctness, which has no place in a drama centered around America's most elite warriors. Hollywood liberals just don't seem to have any comprehension of reality or the measures that need to be taken to ensure our freedoms.

A few episodes were outright unwatchable. I must make it known that I'm a veteran and tend to pick apart shows like this. But sheesh, enlisted people are NEVER addressed as ""Sir"", unless you're in boot camp. That's one of the most basic tenets of military courtesy.

I am truly hooked and hope more episodes/seasons come out soon.

Haysbert flexes his muscles, Mamet infuses crisp dialogue making for fun, provocative and often hysterical conversation and the sets are wonderful.

The show has done well in demonstrating the stress and feeling of combat and of Army home life.  The only minor issue I have is that the Colonel is always wearing a uniform that is terribly ""ate up"" as we say.  Whoever does the costumes needs to do about 5 minutes of research on how to set up the ACU's.  That's just me though, pet peeves aside, this is a show that doesn't thrive simply on gunfire and explosions but on the unique dynamics of the military as a whole.

2873131,5,B000RO6JZ4,"This was a really good season for ""The Unit"".  My ordered DVD's showed up on time and are in new condition.",1231200000,,107,4.095238095238095
2873132,5,B000RO6JZ4,"I was looking for a show that has nothing to do with detectives, CSI, cop, FBI or any law enforcement organization. Then I found a show that's about military stuff (The Unit). This is it. I found what I wanted!

The best thing about this show is the action and setting on each episode. You see new buildings with new faces every time. From Afgan to Iran, Cambodia to Pakistan, Brazil to Mexico..more and more. Whether it's a simple body guarding mission for foreign minister or a real serious rescue mission in a rebel area, I enjoy every bit because the Unit team always pull out surprising moves and strats. Occasionally, unseen military toys and gadgets are revealed. Audience can get a better sense on how they pull off some of the close-to-real missions. I've totally no military background and I enjoy it quite a lot. Those with military background all said it's as close as it can be.

Season 2 is slightly fine tuned compared to season 1. The entire season 1 was a pilot for me. Season 2 starts to get into a bit more story in the army base (family side). The missions are as cool as season 1's. Also, Season 2 is a full season with 23 episodes. Plenty of them to enjoy!",1227139200,2,1178,4.423963133640553
2873133,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Even more action than the first season.  All great actors that complement each other.
Can't wait for Season 3",1226361600,,109,4.7368421052631575
2873134,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Otherwise this show never fails to grab my attention. Where something may happen in the first season, the second season will pick up on it in a later episode and then the third. Blane's daughter joins the army and in each season, she returns for an episode. That makes it real for me. And Tiffy's (ugh) affair has been a long and drawn out process. As of 11/16/08, I hope to hear the end of it. But the show itself mixes action with a little soap opera just to make it interesting.",1226275200,,481,4.239130434782608
2873135,5,B000RO6JZ4,"I bought The Unit a while back thinking it might be a fun show to watch. My wife, however, had no interest in the show. After watching the first two episodes of season 1, I made her watch, and we're hooked. The only problem is, at the rate we're going, we'll be caught up too soon, and we'll have to wait to watch like the rest of the world!

Season #2 has been as satisfactory as the first. Each episode is like a little mini-movie, but there are enough returning plotlines to keep the viewer interested. (SPOILER ALERT: The ""relationship"" between the Colonel and Tiffy seems to have disappeared with nary a second word...though admitedly, I'm still not done with season 2 yet.)

So far, my favorite episode has been ""Natural Selection"" where Bob is forced to keep himself and a translator alive after a helicopter crash. The flashbacks to his own selection serve to prove that this seemingly soft-spoken, and unlikely hero really does have the mettle to make it as an operator.

Occasionally the acting and writing are the tiniest bit thin. It's not often, and really with this kind of series, the story and action more than make up for it. I'd recommend this show to anyone, but warn against sudden addiction!",1225065600,,1212,4.627906976744186
2873136,5,B000RO6JZ4,I looked forward to watching 2 or 3 episodes each night. They are intriging. So many times the ending to an episode was unexpected whereas most movies are so predictable these days. I can't wait for season three to arrive and as soon as season four is available I will buy it!,1223942400,,276,4.326923076923077
2873137,4,B000RO6JZ4,"I came across The Unit by accident and have been hooked ever since. The concept is great and makes you want to just get up and enlist.

My only drawback is that the DVDs only play well on my PC. On my DVD player, the third and fourth episodes on all the disks don't play.",1220227200,3,271,3.9272727272727272
2873138,5,B000RO6JZ4,"Due to my mistake I purchased this DVD believing that I would be able to view it on my DVD Player which wasn't the case due to Region Codes. Apart from that I received the products quickly, they were cheap in comparision to prices in Australia and are of good quality.",1219708800,,268,4.2745098039215685
2873139,4,B000RO6JZ4,"I found The Unit late in its run, and have gone back and purchased the set. And this is from someone who is not a huge fan of the military--this series is engrossing.

The basics: there are 23 episodes in the box set, which includes additional special features, and ten episodes available with commentary. Standouts include: Force Majeure, Natural Selection, Silver Star, Dark of the Moon and Paradise Lost.

Ever since The Shield, I've been a fan of Shawn Ryan.  Some of the same positives and negatives are present in this series as well.  The male cast members are excellent and can convey an incredible amount of expression in action and spoken word.  Occasionally the performance of the women seems weaker, but it could just be they are given less to work with.  The Unit is weakest in some of the writing.  The 'home front' plot lines are frequently unbelievable and distracting. The storyline with Molly's recruiting showed the most promise, but went to great lengths to justify it by introducing a failing elderly mother we never saw before and have yet to see again. Maybe the military plot lines are unbelieveable as well, but I don't know enough to comment.  Do they think women need a 'female' story line to enjoy an action show? The home plot line of ""Two Coins"" was distracting in its predictability--I was surprised but the lack of surprise endings!

Along these lines, occasionally an episode will send a jarring note when a character will act in an extremely uncharacteristic manner.  I've seen the character of Bob be extremely articulate and thoughtful with Kim in one episode, to turn into a terse, monosyllablic jerk in another. This happens on The Shield as well, and I get the sense that the writers are sitting around saying, ""what would be shocking and unexpected here?"" rather than striving for an overall cohesive story where a character is gradually exposed with all the strengths, flaws and contridictions of a real person.

That said, the action is excellent, the editing and filmaking well done and the primary/military plot lines are often unique.  Alot of television suffers from canned plots, and for the most part, The Unit continues to surprise.  The acting and filmaking is what sets it apart.",1219363200,,2230,4.867724867724868
2873140,4,B000RO6JZ4,"The Unit cast would definitely surprise you with their outstanding performance and solid presence throughout each of the episodes. Beside Prison Break and may be The Shield, The Unit comes out with a mix of drama, sex, romance, and plentiful of actions that mesmerizes you to the limit. I have enjoyed the show and will be following the coming episodes with great anticipation.",1218585600,2,377,5.0
2873141,5,B000RO6JZ4,"The Unit, Season Two is great.  An excellent show based on real life information and scenarios.  A must have!",1217721600,,109,4.684210526315789
2873142,1,B000RO6JZ4,I really enjoyed season 1 of this show. Season 2 however is garbage. I watched Season 2 by either skimming through on fast forward half the time or otherwise laughing at the stupidity of the stories. The plots in these episodes are ridiculous and way too unbelievable. Who ever wrote these new episodes should be ashamed of yourselves. I won't be buying season 3.,1217462400,,363,4.6875
2873143,5,B000RO6JZ4,The Unit is my favourite TV show and Season 1 & 2 on DVD was a must. Service from Amazon was excellent. I had both DVD's within 7 days.,1215388800,,135,3.689655172413793

2873147,5,B000RO6JZ4,"I got this season as a gift, and was not sure what to think about it.  I finished the whole thing in one weekend, and already got onto Amazon to order season 2.  Nothing better than a special forces show with a little CIA, and army wife drama mixed in.  I was pleasantly surprised, and am looking forward to season 2.

2873150,5,B000RO6JZ4,I fell in love with The Unit ever since it came on the air.  I already have season 1 on DVD so when I saw season 2 I just had to have it. I was a little disappointed in the season 1 finally but you can't beat the finally for season 2.  I can't wait to get season three.  The special features are nice and so is the commentaries. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the show or action series in general.,1202428800,,415,3.7471264367816093

I bought this one and the season one for my husband for his birthday, and he was SOOO happy.  Now he has things to watch in his Semi that don't take forever to have to get through or have to fast forward to get to the part he was at.  He is very happy with the quality and the extras.  If you liked the tv show, but fell behind, this is a GREAT way to catch up.  ""Awesome,"" as quoted by my hubby.",1200960000,,563,3.8017241379310347

If you don't watch tv at all, I highly recommend getting this series.  It's tasteful, informatve and pretty accurate.  Obviously the screen-writers take on their own poetic interpretations of some circumstances and this is entertainment afterall.  But it's not far-fetched at all.",1200096000,2,442,4.905405405405405

Bouncing back and forth between the husbands in harm's way and the wifes, it is all about secrets.  I am surprised that most people don't even know the show exists, the acting is superb, the stories are always fresh and new, and the action is intense.  The most surprising part of the show is the secrets the wives have and what events they have to go through while raising a family.  In the meantime the men are on realistic missions in foreign and domestic situations and use the most realistic weapons available.

Good storylines and good special features as well including the making of the series and interview with Eric Haney. If you have read the book ""inside Delta Force"", don't miss this season as it shows you some of the ""selection process"" into 1st SFOD-D. The last episode will leave you wanting more!!!!

I was surprised that the production team and actors are left-wing, I didn't notice it in 2nd season episodes on this DVD, and didn't see any obvious anti-war bias until this third season currently airing on TV.  The commentary extras on 2nd season DVD sure show some anti-Bush anti-GWOT bias.",1193702400,,363,4.934426229508197

My complaints are with how unrealistic the end got.  I don't know if anyone has read Eric Haney's book ""Inside Delta Force"" but he tried to, at the end of this season, force feed people his crazy theory that the CIA and the particular organization portrayed in this series have some kind of miniature war going on.  The fact is that the end of this season was a force feeding of human waste.",1193616000,4,646,4.440677966101695

I can't wait for the third season to become available. Good episodes with more depth given to the characters on Alpha Team this season, particularly Mack, but also Hector and Charlie. The guys and girls can both enjoy this show. Guys will love the cameraderie between the lads on Alpha Team(My favorite scenes are when they are in the Team bay, after the missions, when they are just hanging out).
