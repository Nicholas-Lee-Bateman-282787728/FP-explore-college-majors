8196652,1,B000QJLQ9E,"Having been to San Francisco in 2012, I bought this DVD in hopes that I could relive the wonderful sights there. However, I quickly discovered that several things about this DVD don't do that. First, and worst, it spends far too much time showcasing the 3 vehicles used to film it--the '67 Shelby Mustang, speed boat, and helicopter--and using animated arrows to show their supposed paths, and drawing maps of everything...all instead of showing the city, which is what people buying this DVD would want to see, I'm assuming. If I wanted to watch a show about fast cars, boats and helicopters, I'd buy a DVD of Top Gear from BBC.

You get to see some of the sights, but this DVD doesn't delve enough into the best things worth seeing enough for even a casual visitor to the city to be happy with this. They glaze over things like Coit Tower, Chinatown, and other areas, because every 2 minutes, they have to show you the car, boat and helicopter again, so they can get their money's worth out of renting them (I guess). Meanwhile, you miss out on a lot of things you thought you were paying to see. I would advise those who want to see San Francisco, either for the first time or to reminisce, to buy something else. Trust me--this is a huge waste of money.",1441411200,,1257,4.465217391304348

I decided to by your DVD. I 'll have a quality souvenir of San Francisco.",1404086400,,215,3.8
8196654,2,B000QJLQ9E,"As a native of San Francisco, I found this DVD to be VERY disappointing! It's shallow, unimaginative, uninspiring,uninteresting and short.

With the exception of the footage of the 1906 Earthtquake and Fire and the still shots, which are quite beautiful, it has ittle to recommend it. There is so much more that could have been done to make one of the world's most beautiful, fascinating and exciting cities come alive.  If you want to see the real San Francisco, don't waste your money or time on THIS DVD!

8196655,3,B000QJLQ9E,"I am thinking about visiting San Francisco and thought this might give me more of an insight into the city. I liked the concept of the city being seen from three different viewpoints. Land, sea and air. The choice of the three guides was given a tongue in cheek feel with their macho persona's. I enjoyed the DVD but would have to say if anything it was a but too short and not in sufficient detail for me. I think I was expecting more of a documentary type DVD rather than a travel blurb which was essentially what it was. Then again it did say that so maybe my expectations were too much.",1297987200,,590,4.230088495575221
8196656,3,B000QJLQ9E,This video is just okay. It's fairly informative but it is not as picturesque as I had expected.,1228089600,,96,4.388888888888889
8196657,5,B000QJLQ9E,"Finally, an entertaining travel guide!!!  Not only did this DVD thoroughly help me plan my family reunion/trip to San Francisco, but I ended up buying another copy for my parents as a souvenir AFTER the reunion as well, so they could have a special DVD memento of the city they grew up in. And of course, they absolutely loved it.  The camera-work of this film is brilliant! I was so impressed by the amazing shots, incredible color, and such a great original score. This DVD really makes San Francisco come alive right before your eyes. Also, there is a special bonus slide-show near the end that shows unbelievably powerful photos of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. It is really something to marvel at how this city has not only stood the test of time through such catastrophe, but has become an even more amazing and inspiring U.S. city.",1197244800,5,846,4.671140939597316
8196658,1,B000QJLQ9E,"Reading the first review i decided to buy this DVD but, frankly, it doesn't show the heart of this beautiful city: not even one shot about Ocean beach, Castro, Twin peaks, the mexican area and San Francisco by night is completely missing.
I also find very boring the same view of the car, the yacht and helicopter.",1195430400,3,314,4.526315789473684
8196659,5,B000QJLQ9E,"This cleverly crafted DVD made me fall in love with San Francisco! From the soaring skyscrapers of the Financial District to the classic splendor that is Golden Gate Park, each shot really captured the true essence of SF. The superb quality and color of this film was very artfully done. In fact, I've never seen San Francisco portrayed so magnificently before. With incredible aerial shots and a very unique, fantastic style of filming, this film definitely plugs into the racing pulse of such a high-energy, captivating city.

I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who is thinking about visiting San Francisco, dreaming about San Francisco, or even to SF natives who crave vibrant, dazzling imagery to jumpstart their memories of this beloved city.",1192924800,3,754,5.130081300813008
