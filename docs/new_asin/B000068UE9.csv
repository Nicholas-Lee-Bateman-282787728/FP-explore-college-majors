1726507,4,B000068UE9,"Some of you may recall Margaret Rutherford in this role.  Unfortunately this was along the lines of casting I forget what clown in the role of Hercule Poirot as was done by that je-n'en-veux-pas Hollywood vomit factory.  Ms Hickson does a quiet, unpretentious and effective job of conveying the character Dame Agatha envisioned.  While the Jane Marle series are somewhat slower moving and less in-your-face than the Poirot series, which probably will always be my favorite (especially the new series without that bungling fool Hastings), I love the serenity with which she proceeds to solve the crime.",1142899200,12,601,5.175257731958763
1726508,5,B000068UE9,"Though quite good in most apsects of its period representation, the plot of The Body in the Library in the McEwen edition was altered so drastically (a lesbian relationship forced into and determining the plot), that I ordered the Hickson Marple editions for comparison. (In A Murder is Announced, a similar relationship can be implied---or not---from the book, so the pointed lesbian portrayal there can be more justified as poetic license.)

My Hickson set arrived, and I must confess that they are as charming in their portrayal of rural England as they were when they came out 15 years ago. I found them wittier as well, more subtle in their humor---I chuckled more. Cheryl Campbell in Murder at the Vicarage is priceless when she says of her cook's pastries, ""Mary takes her rock cakes rather literally, I'm afraid.""

With the upcoming release of a ""younger"" Sherlock Holmes series and a new Pride and Prejudice featuring a very contemporary actress, it seems the excellent and fairly recent productions of classic works are now being redone to make them more ""politcally correct"" and appealing to younger consumers.

Which is no crime, as long as the editions made in the 80's and 90's are still available for helpful comparisons. Give them a try! I'm ordering them now in case they become harder to find later on. (Speaking of classic editions, do see Geraldine McEwen in the hilarious Mapp and Lucia DVD series---with Prunella Scales of Fawlty Towers! Guaranteed tears of laughter!)",1120608000,18,1490,5.0
1726509,5,B000068UE9,"For me, Joan Hickson is the perfect Miss Marple, just as, say, Edith Evans is the perfect Lady Bracknell, or Laurence Olivier the perfect Henry V. To see Joan Hickson play an entirely different character to perfection, watch her as the rich ditzy Mrs. Rivington in ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" Only a bit part, but utterly delightful.",1113955200,11,334,4.775862068965517
1726510,4,B000068UE9,"My favorite Miss Marple film is BODY IN THE LIBRARY, which is included in this set.  First off, unlike for some other reviewers, the films are crisp, no dark multi-gen'd versions on my disks.  Re the set appearance itself, quite charming overall, as if one should sit down with coffee, tea or cocoa while perusing.  The individual disk decor is lovely, with photos from the particular installment, and the disks contain chaptering of the installments (you can elect to view all three eps on disk 1 & 2 in one go or do it on an individual basis).  The real drawback with high irritation factor is the BBC-A ads that appear at the beginning of each disk, you can fast-forward through both, but really they shouldn't be there at all.  One point of possible confusion is John Castle, who played Miss Marple's inspector nephew elsewhere is actually an inspector of non-relation in A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED.  The introduction of the Inspector Slagg character, who resented Miss Marple's detecting skills, is introduced in BODY IN THE LIBRARY.  There is also - on Disk 3 - which contains the two-parter of POCKETFUL OF RYE - a half-hour documentary on the birthplace of Agatha Christie celebrating the centenary of her birth.  In this, the Orient Express makes an appearance as well as the actors who played Marple and Poirot (david suchet) appearing in character and meeting each other formally and for the first time.",1099267200,134,1409,4.817427385892116
1726511,4,B000068UE9,"To begin, Joan Hickson is marvelous as Miss Marple--even better than Margaret Rutherford--no easy task!
The three story's in this set are quite good-though I found the first story-""The Body in the Library""-moved along a little too slowly for my taste.  No such problem with the other two stories however.  ""A Murder is announced"" is the best of the three episodes--in which an announcement of a pending murder is placed in the local newspaper. ""A Pocketfull of Rye"" is also an excellent story--which I especially enjoyed because of Peter Davison--better known as Tristan in ""All Creatures Great and Small"" as well as portraying ""Doctor Who""
These storys are great to watch in a group setting--trying to figure out among yourselves ""Who done it""",1078876800,20,744,5.040650406504065

1726531,5,B000068UE9,"The whole series, all in one box, nice.  Re-mastering most notable in the quality of the sound - can turn it up nice and loud.  I didn't notice so much a RADICAL difference in the picture quality.  A few scraps of restored scenes, most notably in Mirror Cracked and 4:50 from Paddington - don't get me wrong, they're just a few seconds worth, but both help to establish the characters more clearly (Marina Greg's vulnerability especially [makes her sympathetic instead of just psycho] and Lucy's passion for order) and sheds a lot of light on dialogue and storyline line throughout these two shows.  These adaptations were so efficiently written and directed that it makes the tinkering, evident in the restorations, baffling; honestly, just to fit in two 30 second commercials.  Guess I'll have to wait for a future iteration to explain the traced parcel in Nemesis.  Bonus features and extras OK - but rather do show you how good the original stuff was, and how much technology has improved.  You are well remembered Miss Hickson and well served by this collection.  I took my discs out of the multi disc boxes provided and put them in skinny jewel boxes.  Avoid the super cheap too good to be true versions (more than 60% off retail) of these re-issued gussied up classic sets - I think my Poirot complete set is a knock off - the 1st rate box looks the same, but some of the discs don't play and the image quality is poor and I refer to a replacement set - got what I paid for/perhaps deserved.",1520380800,,1498,4.580524344569288

1726569,5,B000068UE9,"Top notch!!  She is the one Agatha Christie asked to play Miss Marple after seeing her in a play.  She went backstage from what I understand and said she was the one that should play her character.  There are just some people meant to play certain characters such as Raymond Burr as Perry Mason and David Suchet as Poirot. Joan Hickson was meant to play Miss Marple.  It is interesting to note that in one of the Margaret Rutherford movies as Miss Marple (Murder Most Foul, if I remember correctly) Joan Hickson had a minor role.  She would never have guessed (I'm surmising here) that she would end up the consummate Miss Marple herself.",1518652800,,638,4.56140350877193
1726570,5,B000068UE9,Joan Hickson is the best Miss Marple ever. The way she brings Agatha Christie's character to life is incredible. No one comes even remotely close to the way Ms. Hickson portrays all of Miss Marple's best qualities. I remember watching these with my Mum when they first came out. It is so wonderful to be able to share them with my kids.,1518566400,,336,4.435483870967742

1726595,1,B000068UE9,"The ""Digital Remastering"" makes the scenes look like something from the Wizard of Oz. The grass is strangly bright green, blue eye color a smear of excessive violet, faces are incredibly red-orange. I purchased this for a friend who loves the series and they brought it over to show it to me. I will purchase my friend an undigitally-remastered version. Miss Marple with Joan Hickson is the best of Agatha Christie: the real writer Agatha Christie saw Joan Hickson in a stage play in London and afterward told her that she would make a perfect Miss Marple. Many years later her wish was fulfilled. Quiet and well-acted, Miss Marple takes you to a simpler time. Very talented cast.",1515024000,,680,4.771186440677966

1726611,3,B000068UE9,Joan Hickson is the best Miss Marple ever. My only complaint is the restoration quality. This HD restoration is superior to my previous set marketed by Lionheart which appeared to have been copied from a VHS tape but it's still lacking. Perhaps it's the age or quality of the original source which is a shame if it's true because Joan Hickson's Miss Marple deserves better.,1513209600,,373,4.753846153846154

1726685,3,B000068UE9,Disappointing. Touted as being great visuals in hi DEF. I played it on my HDTV and it doesn't look any better than my older version from many years ago of the same videos. Plus they assembled them in out of chronological order so that Marple meets inspector slack in body in the library On the second disk rather than on the first disk. That's not a major issue but it does represent to me some shoddy work in the production. And lastly there's no scene selection on the disc menu so if you leave the video in the middle you've got to go all the way back from the beginning and use your search feature to advance to more or less where you left off.  I gave it three stars anyway because it is after all still the great Joan Hickson as miss Marple.,1503964800,2,747,4.1875

1726700,5,B000068UE9,"""Body in the Library""

Mrs. Dolly Bantry (Gwen Watford) tries to inform her husband of the reported body and is accused of imagining the report due to reading trashy books in bead at night. As usual Jane is always in the right place to view the potential suspects. Clues are everywhere yet who would mix body's and books?
Speaking about night I would not start this film to late, as it seems to go on forever at 151 minutes. As it was a made for TV (1984), I suspect that this movie is a composite of a series. And there are places where it takes leaps to different situations with out any transition. You can guess the plot in general but the details are surprising. It is wrapped up so quickly that you will need to run the ending a few times to put it all in perspective

""A Murder is Announced""

A man dies in Chipping Kleghorn under mysterious circumstances and suddenly Aunt Jane is coming to stay. As with most Agatha Christie's movies, everybody and nobody could have done it. Miss Jane Marple is the catalyst that helps Inspector Craddock (John Castle) and others to view the situation differently and extrapolate the ""who"" that done it.
 It is interesting that the inspector in some movies, is related to Jane and in other movies not. Inspector Craddock here is interesting as he is polite and tolerant of the people he is interrogating.
It is fun to try and match the real names of the actors with the part that they are playing. Would you suspect that Hannah is (Elaine Ives-Cameron)? Or that Miss Hinchcliffe is (Paola Dionisotti)?
Anyway keep your eyes open, as there is not a wasted movement or word in this movie.

""A Pocket Full of Rye""

 Rex Fortescue is out of character as he arrives at is office. You immediately know something is wrong because this is England and Rex has ordered his tea much too early. Yep mean old nasty Rex is found dead. Thorough detectives have determined that there was some mysterious grain in his pocket. If you remember the nursery rime you can follow the story. So how does Jane become involved? She trained the maid and is afraid for her safety. Naturally at several places in the mystery Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) points out the obvious to Det. Sergeant Hay (Jon Glover) who realizes and corrects the error of not listening to her.
There is only one repugnant scene where you have to watch Rex eat. Other than that it is a thoroughly enjoyable mystery.",1502668800,,2404,4.53810623556582

Lake were involved in the investigation and already knew Miss Marple? Now I am watching The Body in the Library, on the second disc, and Sgt. Lake and Inspector Lake have not even met Miss Marple.

Checking on Wikipedia, the titles on my discs are not in chronological order.  The first disc starts off with The Murder at the Vicarage and The Moving Finger. The second disc has The Body In the Library.  Why the mix up?  I just hope that my discs don't freeze up like others have stated that theirs did.

I really don't want to take the trouble and pull out and watch the movies in order, looking through all of the discs, choosing one from one disc and another from another disc.

Other reviews were quite right:  the quality of the re-mastering is excellent, the voices are much improved and that thrills the heck out of me, as I adore these particular Marple programs-excellent performances.  My only complaint is that the order of the movies is NOT in order of original presentation (1984-1992) and there are the occasional references to prior 'events' not yet in line to be viewed on the discs (i.e., The Body-in-the-Library event/person was referred to in Murder at the Vicarage [first on the discs but fifth to be aired).

One can't even rent a disc from Netflix.  So, if you passionately agree that Hickson remains the definitive Marple (or want to know why that is true), this set is a must have.  Before remastering, the colors were washed-out and the sound a bit muddy, but now they are lush and clear.

If only we could have every book and short story Christie wrote on Miss Marple starring her. What a joy.  She truly added to my enjoyment of life and I am grateful. I hope her surviving family read this.  I am having trouble finding reruns on streaming of Netflix, Amazon, and Acorn with Miss Hickson.  Its easy and convenient vs. dvd's.

The stories never wavered much from the books, and I have read every one several times, and Joan Hickson was spot on.  She was the very best Miss Marple and the time frame was the perfect.  Every story in this collection is perfect, the characters are right on target, the era is perfect and should never be changed as they recently did with Tommy and Tuppence.  If only they would do the rest of her stories with such perfection in era, and casting as they did with Miss Marple.  I would love to see Tommy & Tuppence stories just as they are in the books, same era, and terrific casting.

While it is true that there is some improvement in color saturation and sharpness, there are still fuzzy artifacts and extensive pixelation. Blacks are deep blue with grey haze. If BBC was going to go through the trouble of remastering, they should have released it on Blu-Ray, optimized for UHD televisions (the likely intended vehicle for someone who re-buys the collection). Even without Blu-Ray, they could have done better; I have some quite old TV series DVDs which, though not even remastered, look quite smart on my screen, after up-conversion.

In addition, these BBC productions from the mid-1980s and early 1990s are wonderfully understated in contrast to the recent productions starring Julia McKenzie. The bonus feature, the BBC documentary ""A Very British Murder"" with the historian Lucy Worsley as the presenter, is also very enjoyable. (The bonus feature is in 3 parts, one part being included on disc 3 of each 3 disc volume in the set; the disc label for disc 3 of volume 1 didn't list the bonus feature, but the show is in fact on the disc.)",1444608000,70,589,4.673076923076923

I did wish I had known about and ordered the 2015 remastered version though.  I ordered #2 in the remastered format and love the excellent color and HD quality.  I also like the original version of the stories.  The Geraldine McEwan versions have many annoying storyline changes and one change of a murderer. Yuck!  The Joan Hickson versions do justice to Agatha Christie's great plots.",1440374400,4,515,4.688888888888889
1727375,5,B000068UE9,"BBCs remastering of Joan Hicksons Miss Marple episodes is a huge success as far as Im concerned. The colors and clarity are bright and beautiful. The sound has been cleaned up. Hicksons masterworks now look as good as her acting and Christies writing deserve.

Joan Hickson played Miss Marple in 12 episodes and all 12 of them are included in this Complete Collection. Thats 23  hours of top-notch mystery viewing. English subtitles are available.

The Complete Collection includes one Bonus Feature, the 3-part 2013 British TV series A Very British Murder.

Each part of the bonus feature is 50 minutes long. Host Dr. Lucy Worsley takes you on a tour of Englands love affair with murder mysteries.  Part One tells how real-life murders became an entertainment industry, starting in 1810. Part Two covers two important changes. First, the London Metropolitan Police Force, in the last half of the 19th century, becomes scientific. They actually start detecting. Secondly, improved literacy rates and cheaper books meant that fictional detectives became stars. If youve read about the publics outcry when Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes in 1893, you have an idea of the grip fictional mysteries had on the public. Part Three carries forward with the newly sensationalized reporting of real murders, as well as the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. All in all, this Bonus feature is a pleasant few hours of murder!

In case you are wondering, there is no NEW material in this Complete Collection. Hicksons remastered episodes were previously issued in three DVD/BluRay sets, titled Volumes One, Two and Three. Each of those 3 sets has one of the 3 parts of Lucy Worsleys TV series. So, if, like me, you already have the three Volumes of remastered episodes, you will get nothing new in the Complete Collection.

Volume One Episodes:
Murder at the Vicarage
The Moving Finger
The Body in the Library
A Murder is Announced

1727378,5,B000068UE9,"As a very young child, I vaguely remember seeing the advertisements on PBS for AGATHA CHRISTIES MISS MARPLE starring Joan Hickson. I was far too young to know what they were about, but they would show up during the commercials when I was watching SEASAME STREET or MISTER ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD or THE ELECTRIC COMPANY. It would be decades later before I watched any of these shows as I prepared to direct a production of TEN LITTLE INDIANS.

Miss Marple is the archetype for the modern detective: the person who seems to be a bumbling old fool and the least likely person in the world to solve a mystery is really a master at solving them. Its the type of character that tv loves and weve had all sorts of variations of it from COLUMBO to MURDER SHE WROTE to MONK. Christies Miss Marple was one of the, if not THE first, and she is portrayed wonderfully in MISS MARPLE  3 FEATURE LENGTH MYSTERIES by Joan Hickson.

This set of 3 feature-length movie-mysteries includes:

The Body in the Library  a mysterious blonde woman is found dead in the library of the Bantrys, some wealthy neighbors of Miss Marple. It turns out the girl is a dancer who worked at a nearby luxury resort hotel. However, things are never what they seem in an Agatha Christie story.

A Murder Is Announced  as a joke, someone takes an ad out in the local newspaper announcing the date, time, and location of a murder. However, it turns out not to be much of a joke when a murder actually does occur, but the person murdered is the person who placed the ad.

A Pocket Full of Rye  a murderer uses the old nursery rhyme to play a gruesome game of murder with the Fortescue family. Things become personal for Miss Marple when her old maid, Gladys, is found murdered as part of the game.

Joan Hickson is marvelous as Miss Marple. She is the epitome of the character and although other better actresses have played the character, none of embodied Miss Marple as well as Hickson.

Each of the mysteries is about 2 hours and 40 minutes long. There are also a couple extras in this set of DVDs including the Crime Does Pay featurette that shows the meeting of Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) and Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) during the dentenary celebration of Agatha Christie as well as the cast bios.

Overall, if you enjoy good mysteries or are a fan of Agatha Christie, you will probably like Miss Marple and watching MISS MARPLE  3 FEATURE LENGTH MYSTERIES.",1439510400,,2420,4.535632183908046

The accents are a little hard to follow, especially during the big explanation at the end. And when all is explained at the end, there is no flashback acting out the entire crime and how it took place. It's just Ms. Marple talking and telling a room of people how the crime was committed and you have to listen carefully to understand. Still good and still worth getting but I enjoyed the 1960s Marple movies (4 in all) featuring a hilarious Margaret Rutherford as Ms. Marple who does ALL the snooping around and brings a lot of fun and personality to the character.",1424995200,2,744,4.559701492537314

These productions are true to the original material (unlike the horrible Marple series from 2000) and the performances are top notch.  Simply a fabulous treat for Christie fans.",1424649600,,473,5.116883116883117
1727434,5,B000068UE9,"These three movies originally aired in 1984, 1985 and 1990. I still consider Joan Hickson the best Miss Marple ever filmed.

In this 3-disc set, you get 421 minutes of top flight Agatha Christie, brilliantly scripted and acted. There are limited Bonus Extras on 2 of the discs.

DISC 1 ""The Body in the Library"" (159 minutes in 3 parts)
Dolly Bantry and her husband are more than startled to awake one morning to find the body of a girl lying on their library carpet. Before the police even get there, Dolly is on the phone to her great friend, Jane Marple: ""My dear, we've just found a body in our library. I'm coming down to fetch you so you can see it before Constable Palk gets here.""

Jane comes and they look over the body (without touching, of course). Dolly tells Jane, ""We've never seen her before. It ought to be a practical joke except that she's dead. She's a blonde. Platinum blonde. In our library!""

I find this episode special for a couple reasons. One is Dolly's absolute confidence in Jane. Secondly, the horrid effect of gossip on Colonel Bantry is well drawn.

DISC 2 ""A Murder is Announced"" (159 minutes in 3 parts)
Near the ocean, the residents of tiny Chipping Cleghorn are delighted to see this in the Gazette's personals column: ""A Murder Is Announced, and will take place on Friday October the 5th at Little Paddocks at 7 pm. Friends, please accept this as the only intimation.""

Just before 7, a bunch of friends congregate in Miss Blacklock's drawing room, agog for the fun of a mystery murder game. The trouble is, she doesn't know any more about that ad than they do. This makes it rather astounding when someone is actually killed. Fortunately, Miss Marple is taking a nearby ocean-side vacation, courtesy of her nephew Raymond. Only she can plumb the desperation which went into this killing. And the next.

This is a wonderful episode with great plotting. Take special care to listen for ""Lettie"" and ""Lottie"".
....Bonus Feature A. ""Who's Who"". This consists of written biographies of 11 actors in the episode.

DISC 3 ""A Pocketful of Rye"" (103 minutes in 2 parts)
Mr. Fortescue, of Fortescu Holdings, is in a jolly mood when he arrives at his office. But by the time the secretary brings in his tea, something is dreadfully wrong. He collapses and is dead before the ambulance arrives. Fortescu was obviously poisoned and it's going to be an intriguing case for the police, especially as the dead man has an envelope of rye in his pocket.

Nobody seems terribly displeased by the man's death. His very young wife has a lover. One son, who'd worked for his company, was rewarded by his father calling him ""a miserable petty-fogging clerk."" A second son had been driven away 20 years ago. Fortescu is described, by more than one person, as ""a horrid man"".

Which doesn't mean he deserved to be murdered. Fortunately for the truth, Miss Marple becomes involved when Gladys, the Fortescu maid, calls her for help.

This is a well-written story, though it starts slow - the full tragedy isn't exposed until the poignant end.
....Bonus Feature B. ""Crime Does Pay"" (1990) This TV special celebrates the centenary of Agatha Christie's birth. Host Keith Blackler starts, ""The wealthiest writer this country has ever known [this was pre-Harry Potter] died 14 years ago. But I'm sure she's with us today in spirit."" This is a light-hearted look of Christie tourism. Commentators include Peter Berridge (curator Torquay Museum) and Mathew Prichard (Agatha's grandson). There are also appearances by Joan Hickson and David Suchet (Joan Hickson's counterpart, as the greatest portrayal of Hercule Poirot).
....Bonus Feature C. ""Who's Who"". Written biographies of 8 actors in the episode, including Peter Davison. His bio includes his time on Dr. Who (1982-1984), but doesn't include his later mystery series ""The Last Detective"" (2003-2007).

Just in case you didn't know, the BBC is issuing remastered sets of Joan Hickson's twelve Miss Marple mysteries. Here's a link to Volume 1:

Agatha Christie's, Miss Marple, staring Joan Hickson and produced by BBC TV Production consists of three feature length movies on 3 discs, each in an individual plastic folder. Joan Hickson is by far the best and only genuine Miss Marple. Agatha Christie selected her for the part and Joan Hickson created the image of Miss Marple that fits the character of the subject to perfection. Others have tried to play the part, and a few have gotten close, but regardless of their qualifications as actresses, none of them have equaled the true image of Miss Marple, a spinster living in St. Mary Mead, that was created by Agatha Christie and portrayed by Joan Hickson. It seems odd to say this about a murder mystery, but you will find yourself fully enjoying every minute of a Miss Marple mystery, she can communicate more with the blink of her eye than you can imagine. When top level brass at Scotland Yard tells their Chief Inspectors to stop in to see Miss Marple you won't be able to resist a big grin.

The 3 mysteries in this set include,

The Body in the Library (No. 40, 1942): In the early morning at Gossington Hall, Dolly Bantry was languishing in bed when she was startled by the hysterical shouts of her house maid ""Oh ma'am, oh ma'am there's a body in the library"". At the unusual hour of 7:45 am Jane Marple's phone began ringing; the caller said it's Dolly Bantry. The official investigation is taken over by Inspector Slack. But soon Miss Marple is brought in by an old friend of hers who has retired from a high post at Scotland Yard and is convinced that only Jane Marple will find the correct solution.

A Murder is Announced (No. 52, 1950):-One Friday morning, on October 29th the personals column of the Chipping Cleghorn Gazette carried a very unusual advertisement: ""A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 pm. A little before the appointed time the guests began to arrive, soon the small room was full. At 6:30 the lights went out, a door opened and the beam of a flash light searched around the room. A voice called out: ""stick `em up!"" Two gunshots followed. Then there was a third gun shot, and the intruder's body slumped to the floor. After the usual interrogation, Chief Inspector Craddock and Jane Marple teamed up to solve the case.

A Pocket Full of Rye: (No. 58, 1953): Rex Fortescue, an investment trust executive, went into painful, spasmodic movement caused by taxine poisoning while he was having his morning tea at his office. Curiously he was found to have a pocket full of rye grain. There was a second murder while the victim was eating bread with honey. The third murder was of a recently hired maid hanging out the clothes in her garden. The body had a clothes pin on its nose. That was enough to summon Miss Marple who had trained the maid.

The king was in his counting house, counting out his money,
The queen was in the parlor, eating bread and honey,
The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes,
When there came a little dickey bird and nipped off her nose.

This set of three Miss Marple mysteries together with the nine Miss Marple mysteries in The Classic Collection, which I previously discussed and reviewed, will complete your set of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple Movies until the time that BBC decides to make more movies of the queen of mysteries stories. In the mean time sit back and fully enjoy these twelve Miss Marple mysteries, I know that you will love them.",1391817600,,3492,4.595505617977528
1727528,5,B000068UE9,I am a Agatha Christie fan and I think A&E did a great job of staying with the book and making the characters come alive just as they were in the book.,1391126400,,151,3.75
1727529,5,B000068UE9,"I've seen all the Miss Marples, but the sensitive portrayal of *this* maiden lady is just genius! These (3) are stories you don't want to end. ""A Murder is Announced"" was always one of my favorite stories and on-screen it didn't disappoint. It was a who-dun-it to the end - done with such sensitivity that the viewer was emotionally split at the denouement. The Body in the Library is the quintessential British murder mystery but refrains from allowing itself to slip into a parody. Dame Agatha cleverly knit the pieces together, purling red herrings into the pattern. Luscious!  A Pocketful of Rye progressed from one awful death to another according to the nursery rhyme, which should have given me a hint as to the killer, but came as a shock when this skein was unraveled. Miss Hickson alone stepped out from my imagination while reading the stories and stepped onto the screen unchanged. She is the perfect portrayal of one of the world's most beloved and terrifyingly astute ""aunts"".  She sees and she listens - an unnerving trait in anyone! Very few do, you know.",1389225600,,1071,4.783783783783784

He and Joan played so well together, I feel there was respect between them on and off camera. The whole cast is wonderful, the cottages are believable, quaint and comfy looking. The village scenes make me want to go back to England and drive through the countrysides.

1727535,5,B000068UE9,"I ordered this solely for ""The Body in the Library"", my all-time favorite Joan Hickson Miss Marple, and have lost count of how many times I've watched it.  Besides being one of Miss Hickson's best performances as Jane Marple, it is also Gwen Watford's best performance as Miss Marple's best friend, Dolly Bantry.  Who can forget the way she gently but firmly cajoles husband Arthur into leaving his nice warm bed to find out if there really is a body in their library!  (Ms. Watford appears again as the now-widowed Dolly in ""The Mirror Crack'd From Side To Side"", and Dolly Bantry is also mentioned, but doesn't appear, in ""Sleeping Murder"", another of my 5 favorite Joan Hickson Marples.  The character of Body's Basil Blake has a tendency to grate at first, but becomes another favorite by the end, as does the non-human ""character"" of Basil's vintage red sports car and the 1920's ""flapper"" music played whenever the car appears.  The cinematography and locations are outstanding and not affected by the transfer to DVD as some transfers are.  Same for the sound quality.  Captions for the hearing-impaired or those not familiar with Brit-speak is, thankfully, available on this BBC version, which is not necessarily the case on A&E DVDs of other Marple episodes.

The Body in the Library:
It's early Friday morning and Dolly Bantry is just barely awake.  She hears footsteps on the stairs and gently attempts to stir her sleeping husband by whispering, ""Tea. Arthur."" Their young maid, Mary, enters but she isn't bringing tea, she cries, ""Oh! Ma'am, ma'am, there's a body in the library!""  Sobbing, she whirls around and leaves.  Dolly sits for a moment in stunned silence before prodding Arthur awake.  Arthur not believing it to be true; Dolly must be imagining things due to her bedtime-murder-mystery-reading, reluctantly and grumpily marches himself downstairs to get to the bottom of such nonsense!  Well, turns out it's true.  There's a blonde, platinum blonde, dead in their library!

Dolly races to the village to fetch Miss Marple so that she can get a look at the body before Constable Palk arrives.  Dolly is sure that her friend Jane will figure out this dreadful situation.  Unfortunately, Arthur is quickly presumed to be guilty of something, if not murder then some kind of suspicious association with the dead young woman when he can't explain her body's presence, he doesn't have an alibi, and everyone knows that ""where there's smoke...""  How can there be a body in the colonel's library and he not know a thing about it?  Things turn even worse for Arthur, if that's possible, when in combination of not having an alibi, he is linked to the victim!

The body is identified as 18-year old, Ruby Keene, a dance hostess at the seaside resort, The Majestic Hotel, where Arthur had recently dined. Inspector Slack, who is assigned to the case, immediately jumps to the conclusion that Colonel Bantry is indeed guilty.  Arthur had means and opportunity and while a motive is not known, Slack feels sure it will come to light.

No matter what, Dolly has unwavering faith in her husband and most especially in Miss Marple.  She confidently proclaims, ""I'm sure Jane's worked it out already!""  Jane replies, ""Well...it's like Tommy Bond and the new school mistress, Mrs. Martin.  She went to wind up the clock and a frog jumped out."" Her answer is met with blank stares and silence...even from Dolly.  Fortunately for Bantry, Chief Constable Colonel Melchett is a friend and neighbor of his and wields his influence to reel in Slack, thereby keeping him out of the nick. Melchett also happens to be an admirer of Jane's keen detection skills and looks to her for her insight and observations.

To do their sleuthing, Dolly whisks Jane to The Majestic to solve this terrible murder of a young woman and in the process ""save"" Colonel Bantry. While at the Majestic, Jane reads in the paper that a young girl has gone missing and she is certain that her disappearance is connected in some way to Ruby's murder. Inspector Slack dismisses Jane's connection theory until, sadly, the young girl's body is found.

The Body in the Library is my favorite Miss Marple movie, in this set.  Joan Hickson is and remains my favorite Miss Marple.  I love, love, love her.  I love her appearance.  She is tastefully and immaculately dressed in respectable, tidy tweed.  She is prim and proper as befits her sensibilities, age, and station. Her hats are wonderfully subdued and suit her perfectly.  There is nothing silly, stereotypical, fussy, or frilly about her.  She is very much no-nonsense and rather stern. While she does give the impression of an old, scatty, and slightly doddering nosey parker; upon further observation this is a false impression.  I like how there is nothing ridiculous about her. She is undaunted by the judgment of those foolish enough to underestimate her.  In fact, she uses people's propensity for writing her off, by their first impression of her, to her advantage.  She plays the nosey-old-lady card at every opportunity.

I also adore Hickson's voice and elocution.  She has a deliberate and measured way of expressing herself and the script delivers the usage of outstanding vocabulary; she speaks in a formal style. She is in no way frivolous in her speech.  She does not banter or blather!  And her facial expressions are marvelous! Her steady blue gaze burns a hole right through her doubters and naysayers. She unflinchingly stares down the most intimidating of killers.  She observes everything, is a ""noticing sort,"" and misses nothing. Miss Jane's mind is razor sharp like a ""bacon slicer.""

Colonel Melchett, very familiar with Jane's ability, calls her redoubtable and further says, ""...she has a forensic intuition that is developed to the point of brilliance.""  Once you get to know her and how her mind operates, you will agree completely with Melchett and learn that her village parallels make perfect sense!  (Trust me, even Tommy Bond, the frog, the clock, and Mrs. Martin will make sense in the end.)

We are introduced to Sir Henry Clithering the very influential and powerful retired Chief of the CID of the Met.  Sir Henry's name will pop up throughout the Miss Marple mysteries.  Clithering is a longtime admirer of Miss Marple's keen mind.  He lends credence and respect to her ""interference"" in most of the murders she solves and prevents.  In fact, he says of her, ""She is one of the most formidable criminologists in England.  I would lay you almost any odds that you would not recognize her as such.  An elderly spinster, sweet, placid or so you would think, yet her mind has plumbed the depths of human iniquity and taken it all in a day's work.  She knows the world through the prism of her little village and its daily life.  By knowing the village so thoroughly she seems to know the world.""

Even under pressure from Jane's advocates, Sir Henry and Colonel Melchett, Inspector Slack does not jump on the Miss Marple Bandwagon.  He smirks and politely gives her the time of day only because he is made to do so.  So Slack, condescendingly listens (as instructed) but doesn't go so far as to take anything Jane offers seriously. After all, she's a ""flaming amateur."" In all fairness to Slack, he doesn't know Jane yet, and has no way of knowing that she's anything more than her misleading appearance. He is definitely not the only one, the culprits are also lulled into a false sense of security by what she seems to be! And then there's that thing she does, spouting seemingly dotty village comparisons, which give the impression that she must be quite doolally!  But don't you be taken in for a minute.  You will regret it.  The guilty and Inspector Slack certainly end up doing so!

All the characters are brilliantly portrayed.  Inspector ""Gotcha!"" Slack's reactions to Miss Marple are priceless and so entertaining.  A bit of humor in the midst of murder. I'm happy to say that you will see him again in; Murder at the Vicarage; (where he is still not on the Marple-band-wagon); 4:50 From Paddington (still not there yet); They Do It With Mirrors (getting there), and The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side (finally there.)  He is stubborn, believes she is just lucky, and he's a slow learner.  Note: Slack is in the Joan Hickson versions only.

The solution to who killed young Ruby Keene isn't immediate.  This film is 2 hours and 22 minutes long.  There are clues to whodunit but they are definitely not a trail of breadcrumbs.  In figuring out this puzzle, the only question you have to ask yourself is; what in the world have Mozart and fingernails got to do with anything?

A Murder is Announced:
In the Chipping Clegghorn Gazette a murder is announced.  It is to take place at Little Paddocks at 7:00 PM.  A collective gasp runs through the village at the prospect of attending a murder.  We are introduced to the characters of the story as they read this announcement in the Gazette.  What does it mean?  ""It means a drink! Probably bad sherry."" Or so thinks Miss Hinchcliffe.  The simple prospect of a drink, even bad sherry is enough to stir her interest. She will attend!  In addition to Hinchcliffe, we meet: Murgatroid; Edmond Sweatenham and his mother Mrs. Sweatenham; Colonel and Mrs. Easterbrook; Vicar  and Mrs. Harmon (who just happens to be Miss Marple's niece--how convenient!) After reading the advertisement, all are intrigued and plan to attend the murder.  The only problem is that the people living at Little Paddocks know nothing about it!  As they too sit around their morning table reading the Gazette, they wonder what is going on, and who in the world would post such an ad!  The young Patrick Simmons, who ""fancies himself a joker"" is instantly suspected by the mistress of the home, Miss Leticia Blacklock.  Nope, he denies it.  As does his sister, Julia, ""who just fancies herself."" Miss Dora Bunner, companion to Miss Blacklock, is very sweet but ""scatty"" and obviously not the culprit.  Also ruled out are the two other occupants of the household, the ""boringly anonymous"", lodger, Mrs. Phillippa Haymes and the ""crazy"", foreign cook, Hannah. So, what does Leticia Blacklock think it means?  With resignation, she says it means that, ""Half the village of Chipping Clegghorn will arrive at seven o'clock.""  She then goes to make sure there is a bottle of sherry in the pantry. Probably bad sherry.

As expected, just prior to the announced time of seven p.m., all of the above (except the vicar, he has a confirmation class) are gathered at Little Paddocks enjoying the central heating and awaiting the countdown to the murder. The clock begins to chime seven and just as Patrick and Phillippa get ready to serve the sherry, there is a crackling noise and the lights go out!  There are excited exclamations, then the door bursts open, a torch shines about into the pitch black room, dazzling everyone, and the intruder shouts, ""Stick-em-up! Stick-em-up, I tell you!""  All seem to think it's quite fun and pretty impressive until three shots are fired.  When the lights come back on there is blood dripping from a grazing bullet wound in Leticia Blacklock's ear...and yes, wouldn't you know it someone is killed. But...was it suicide, an accident or murder?  Murder! Of course! Who says there is no truth in advertising? So who was this masked intruder and why was he shooting at Miss Blacklock?

Miss Marple becomes involved in the case when she is recommended to Inspector Craddock by another appreciative higher-up in the constabulary.  Upon Craddock contacting her, she forthwith invites herself to stay with the Harmons and before you can say ""Bob's your uncle,"" she is on the case, using her nosey-old-lady disguise to get the information that everyone is not sharing with Inspector Craddock.  Needless to say, she turns Inspector Craddock's hypotheses inside out and upside down, and rightly so! Agatha Christie is brilliant in weaving a masterpiece mystery with the most interesting characters.  This is another lengthy offering clocking in at 2 hours and 34 minutes.

A Pocketful of Rye:
""Sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful of rye.  Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie...""  This old, children's ditty is the central theme in the murder of wealthy and prominent financier Rex Fortescue, who dies while in his office, ""his counting house,"" and what's this? he has a pocket full of rye.  He has been poisoned with taxin derived from the yew tree.

When Fortescue's murder hits the papers, Miss Marple is notified of his death by a helpful neighbor because a girl Jane has trained, Gladys Martin, works as a maid for the Fortescue family.  Upon learning this, Miss Marple begins following the drama.

When a second murder, connected to Rex Fortescue occurs, Jane hears about it on the wireless.  Out of concern for Gladys, Miss Marple hurries to the scene.  Her taxi is met at the gates of Yew Tree Lodge, the grandiose home of the Fortescue family. Jane is denied entrance; all visitors must be vetted.  Due to Miss Marple's connection being ""only"" to the maid, her request for entrance is not considered necessary, and she is denied entrance.  Refusing to leave, she insists upon sending a scrawled message to Inspector Neale who is heading up the investigation.  Her message is brief, ""Sing a song of sixpence.""  After reading the note, Inspector Neale completely dismisses her with the comment, ""I think the old girl's got an attic to rent..."" and shoves her note into his pocket to be forgotten.  Inspector Neale sends Sergeant Hay to the gate to send Miss Marple away but she insists on staying, certain that Gladys is in danger! Unfortunately, it isn't long before he is dragging Jane's note out of his pocket and she is asked inside; she's on the case!

The characters involved in this interesting mystery are: Adele Fortescue, the ""young enough to be his daughter"" wife of two years to the murdered Rex; ""pettifogging clerk,"" Percy Fortescue, Rex's eldest son and his wife, the ""invisible"" Jennifer; the ""excellent, cool, and superior,"" housekeeper, Miss Dove; the feisty cook, Mrs. Crump and crotchety butler, Mr. Crump; Gladys ""the rabbit,"" the simple-minded maid; and Mrs. Henderson, the ""much addicted to Scripture,"" sister-in-law to the victim; all of whom live under the roof of Yew Tree Lodge. Returning to Yew Tree Lodge after several years absence, on the evening of his father's murder, is the prodigal son, Lance Fortescue and his good wife, Patricia.  And the final player in this drama is Viviene DuBois, golf instructor and special ""friend"" to Adele Fortescue.  Which of these committed this crime? Or wait, was it someone else?

Also, what in the world have the nursery rhyme and blackbirds to do with anything?  Be sure, Miss Marple soon has it all figured out.  Inspector Neale finds himself saying to his sergeant, ""I'm beginning to wonder who is running this investigation."" Of course there is no mystery there, it is Miss Marple. Indeed.

Some might say that the Hickson versions of Miss Marple are outdated.  I would agree that the images are not as crisp as today's high definition technology delivers.  I love them anyway but can see why an attempt at updating these stories was a good idea and attempted.  Christie's mysteries are a treasure and should be seen by generations to come.  However, I don't go along with tampering with the characters and story lines of the originals.  This set is in keeping with Christie's writing, the sensibilities of the era in which the stories were written, and the period of time depicted. I recommend the Hickson versions above all other Miss Marple films to date.

While the subject matter is murder, I appreciate that there are no detailed autopsies. There are no sex scenes or bad language; adult situations, however, are presented.",1379548800,,14565,4.8696181965881395
1727570,5,B000068UE9,"This is a collection of three Miss Marple mysteries, plus a half hour documentary billed as Miss Marple meets Hercule Poirot. One difference between this and the other Marple series (both the other Hickson collections and the Acorn Media versions with Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie) is that they appear to be aired as multi-part TV series episodes as opposed to movies. The first two thus are longer, 150 minutes compared to the 100 minutes of the third one and the movies. For ""A Murder Is Announced"", that longer setting was perfect; for ""The Body in the Library"", there is some filler -- it's too long for the 100 minute format, but not enough for the extra 50 minutes.

Joan Hickson was the fourth Miss Marple I've seen (Angela Lansbury, McKenzie, and McEwan were the other three), and through watching her versions I do concur she's the best (though McKenzie is almost as good). I have seen both Hickson's and McKenzie's version of two stories (""They Do It With Mirrors"" and ""A Pocketful of Rye"", the latter included here). While I lean with McKenzie's on ""Mirrors"", I liked Hickson's ""A Pocketful of Rye"" here based on the acting and the way the story is told.

The half-hour special in reality is a documentary of the festivities for Christie's 100th birthday at her birthplace, and one of those included a first time meeting of Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) and Miss Marple (Hickson; it was a first-time meeting for the actors as well). That event that got billing on the cover received two minutes in the documentary. I would have enjoyed it more if they had the actors in character discussing Christie's writings.

1727607,4,B000068UE9,"I wasn't familiar with Joan Hickson's portrayal of Agatha Christie's ""Jane Marple,"" the only one I knew was Helen Hayes, so it was a real treat to see these three movies.

I enjoy the theme music and the quaint illustrations at the beginning of each episode, two of the movies ""The Body In The Library"" and ""Murder Is Announced"" is split up into three episodes each, while the remaining one ""A Pocketful Of Rye"" is split into two episodes, which I assume is how they originally aired. Anyway, the openings are really nice, as the camera pans in and shows some shifty characters lurking in the shadows, reminding us that things are not always what they seem.

The quality on each movie is OK; although the back of the DVD box says the movies have been remastered, the picture isn't as sharp as something current but this is probably due to the source material having degraded. Still, the visual quality won't interfere with viewing pleasure.

I haven't read any of Christie's books, so I don't know how faithful the movies are, but watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Poirot-Series-1-Blu-ray/dp/B005X5XIME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Poirot: Series 1 [Blu-ray</a>], and comparing the two, I find differences in how both play out. In these Miss Marple Mysteries, Miss Marple almost seems like a secondary character who comes and goes, while the series of ""Poirot"" has the Belgium detective front and center.

Watching Joan Hickson's portrayal as ""Miss Marple"" and she seems at times like a babbling spinster suffering from dementia, but it's only because she's lost in thought, trying to remember where or when she saw or heard something, and you can almost see the gears spinning in her mind. The character speaks with little nuggets of info and it seems that she might have figured out who done it, but she won't reveal it until she's got all the puzzle pieces and that they fit together, which is when she reveals all to us viewers. Great fun.

There are cast text bios in the special features and a really nice featurette called ""Crime Does Pay.""

* CRIME DOES PAY * -- 29:11-minutes -- 1990 Featurette
The special was created in 1990 and is narrated and hosted by Keith Blackler and takes the viewer to Torquay, known as the English Riviera and Christie's birth place, which is celebrating the her centenary birthday. There are scenes of Mystery Tours, where people can pay to become part of a mystery and try and solve it, you get to go on board the Orient Express, and a meeting between Joan Hickson ""Miss Jane Marple"" and David Suchet ""Hercule Poirot"", both in character. There's also interviews with both Hickson and Suchet, and Christie's grandson Mathew Prichard.

There are three DVDs in all with a running time of 421-minutes, according to the box. If you like mysteries and British TV, I think you'll enjoy this set.

1727641,5,B000068UE9,"I prefer Jaon Hickson ahead of all the other Miss Marples, with Margaret Rutherford a close second.

1727642,5,B000068UE9,"As an Agatha Christie addict, I enjoy both Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple stories. Each of these 3 stories, starring Joan Hickson, are clever and confusing, as Miss Marple has to solve ingenious murder plots, such as a murder's time and place being announced in a newspaper.  She always gets her man (or woman) in spite of the handicap that police inspectors don't want an old spinster like her interfering in their murder investigations.

Several Miss Marple mysteries have been filmed more than once with different actresses playing Miss Marple.  Agatha Christie herself wanted Joan Hickson to play Miss Marple.  Not only is Joan Hickson a marvelous actress, but other versions of these mysteries have tinkered with the stories to ""sex them up"" and to make them ""more exciting"", which often causes flaws to appear in Christie's ingenious plots.  If you enjoy clever murder mysteries, you can't do better than Joan Hickson playing Miss Marple (unless it's David Suchet playing Hercule Poirot).",1306713600,4,999,5.104294478527607
1727643,5,B000068UE9,This is our third Miss Marple mystery movie purchase.  We can't get enough of her.  I would recommended this to any mystery lover.,1303862400,,130,4.608695652173913
1727644,5,B000068UE9,"This collection is the best of the best for Miss Marple.  I really enjoyed ""A Murder is Announced"".  Definite buy for any Agatha Christie Fan!",1300406400,2,142,4.64
1727645,5,B000068UE9,"Here are the three episodes of the Hickson/Marple series from the 1980s that were not part of the A&E release of the other nine.  This BBC/Warner Brothers set is a better quality product than A&E's, but they are the only way to have the entire series.  This classic show deserves a new release with improved picture and sound quality.  As it is now the sound and picture are good but the camera work is so beautiful it deserves the best possible cleaning up, and the musical score is ingenious for a television production.

This episode, A Murder is Announced, is perfectly cast.  But then the whole series is excellently cast.  Older stars lead in this episode.  Ursula Howells, not very well-known in the USA but one of the fine actresses from the 40s and 50s in England, Renee Asherson, Olivier's Queen Catherine in Henry V, and Joan Sims, the true queen of the Carry On movies, anchor down the eclectic team.  John Castle is a very appealing Inspector Derwent Craddock.  And there is the masterful Joan Hickson's Miss Marple, as always.  What a great comedienne she was.  Her long turtle-like head with those beady little blue eyes and wry twisted mouth speak volumes without seeming to do anything at all but peer or perhaps muse on something in her mind.  There is usually a great character part written in to these episodes, and in A Murder is Announced we are introduced to a classic ""foreigner in England"" named Hannah.  She is a refugee from Hitler's Europe and appears to have fled from someplace like Transylvania or Albania.  Elaine Ives-Cameron is over the top but perfectly so.

A Pocket Full of Rye is very funny yet possesses its poignancies in one of the deaths.  A horrid nouveau-riche family, the Fortescues, are a nutty collection of vile people, the kind who cropped up in England and America after the war, fancied themselves aristos when all they were were glorified hillbillies.

Miss Marple is especially acid in her quiet remarks about the house to which she has come to seek out the killer of poor Gladys, the housemaid who Miss Marple had trained in St Mary Mead.  Charm and ghoulishness, as usual, are all tossed together, with black humor, dry acerbic to make this my favorite of the entire series.

Inspector Neal is performed with boyish charm and gentleness by a young and handsome Tom Wilkinson.  A veritable post-war Prince Charming.  There are two outstanding comedic performances from Selina Cadell as Miss Dove and Annette Badland as poor Gladys Martin, the housemaid.  Cadell is like a tainted Snow White who is first seen gazing at herself in a mirror.  Miss Dove is played with an unflappable aplomb and clear-eyed menace, it's a very funny performance by an actress who shows huge comedic talent in a difficult role.

Poor Gladys Martin is a simple country girl who has little choice in life other than to be one of the last of the old-fashioned housemaids of the lowest order.  She is a good girl but she's also an imbecile.  However, Gladys is a brilliantly written character and is hilariously performned with a ponderous twitching quality by Annette Badland.
Her Poor Gladys is my favorite housemaid of all in this series.  Frank Mills is the lugubriously oily butler of the new age (England after WW2).

The Body in the Library is a more famous Christie story and this is, like the rest of the series, the best adaptation of a Marple story you can get on film.  Great supporting work from Moray Watson and Gwen Watford as the Bantry's.
David Horovitz's Inspector Craddock is very prickling and conceited and arrogant but somehow he's likable, and he does occasionally unbend to Miss Marple, who he refers to as ""that nice grey cobra"".

Get this series while you can because I don't think, the way things are going, there may ever be another, improved, release of Hickson's Miss Marple, which is sad.",1299024000,8,3847,4.75

This so is not how I wanted this to be displayed..  Very upset on the care given.",1522022400,,228,4.044444444444444
