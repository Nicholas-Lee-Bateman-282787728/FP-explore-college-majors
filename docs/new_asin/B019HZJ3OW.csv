8745307,5,B019HZJ3OW,"I found this movie to be unique and interesting. This four episode DVD is about Alisa and her four teenage friends embarking on many adventures. The first episode is about an adorable creature called a Truenox. This series is original, funny, and quirky with the added bonus of mysteries to solve and I found it very enjoyable to watch.

My favorite episode was A Singing Showdown because it had a mystery and the outcome was shocking. It was hilarious and I loved the music attached to this show down to see who will rule the planet.

The characters are colorful and resembled real teenagers. They are real geniuses who think outside of the box to create new and cool ideas to save people, creatures and their planet. My favorite character was Alisa because she showed girl power, humor and she would be a great best friend.

She rises to the occasion whenever there is danger or a problem. The voiceovers were perfect. They matched their emotions and the voices of real teenagers. Each character has their own unique voice and characteristics, which match the avatar. This made the film very believable.

The Truenox was a cute pet that I could just hug for days which they rescue in the first episode The Mysteries of the Last Truenox. He is an alien that helps Alisa and her friends on their adventures. He is comical and adds humor to the series which made me laugh a lot. Just one smile from him and I found myself smiling back.

Their adventures had many learning lessons including, the power of friendship is greater than anything. You should not judge people or animals based on their looks. Personality and their true hearts are better traits then just good looks.

The animation is colorful and has amazing details. I felt like I was in the future and could live on this futuristic planet. The people are done in a way which makes them feel real. I found this to an amusing place which I would enjoy being a part of. Flying cars and boots would be amazing to own. The different gadgets and modes of transportation added to futuristic feel of this movie. All of the space aliens were peculiar and plausible. Their design is unusual and entertaining.

The age range is 6-15. It is cute and funny and the story line is easy to follow. The bright animation is sure to keep everyone engaged and entertained. I give this movie 5 galactic stars.

My Review:
 N Circle Entertainment does a great job of making videos that are fun and educational!

 Who doesn't love a good space related story? Most children love anything with a super hero ring to it. And this is a story for the record books, itself. Alisa Knows What to Do comes from a series of very famous Russian science fiction novels. I love it when they take books and make movies out of them. These are perfect for your children and the kicker is that they battled some effects globally. so this would interest children but also teach them about the world around them.

 Alisa doesn't do these things alone she has a group of friends that help her in her ventures. Her goal is to do what she can to help save mankind from imminent danger. They dislike any injustice in the world but they also are concerned with the environment, as well. These type of movies teach our children more than just fighting crime. As a mom I live things like this that provide double duty.
