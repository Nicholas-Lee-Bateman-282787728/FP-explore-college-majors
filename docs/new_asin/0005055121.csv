The video ""50 Years of ""Thorns and Roses"" is very special because we see and hear the real Padre Pio. We see where he lived as a child, where he studied and where he lived as a monk. We hear his voice and see him talking to people and with people as well  as at the altar saying Mass. It is very special to see a saint in action as Father Pio had the same 5 stigmas as Christ had on the cross.
Believe me it is a true story. Buy it!
Since Padre Pio's language was Italian, the English narration is very well done by Edmund Purdom's nice voice.
