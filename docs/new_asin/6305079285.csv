8161592,5,6305079285,"I have the VHS of this movie which was released a long time ago. The VHS picture is poor quality. The movie is quite blurry all the way through. This movie deserves a much better quality picture and thats why one of the film studios should release it on DVD. So many older movies have been made into DVD's but they missed this good movie. Well known movie stars of the time are in the movie such as Martin Sheen (looks like his son Charlie) in this movie. The movie main deals with 3 couples who were lovers and who have letters sent to them. Three letters go missing from the U.S. mail and are not discovered for a long time later. The movie takes you back to earlier times and how the letters came to be written and what happened to the people involved in the letters. June Allyson is in the movie, Ken Berry, Belinda Montgomery, Juliet Mills (Nanny). I hope a film studio will find this movie and release it on DVD. Its older movie now, but much better than most newer movies.",1279584000,,979,4.268817204301075
