Besides the movie being quite short, I love classic game room and this movie gave me great insight in to the past history of the show!",1383436800,,281,4.222222222222222
2799109,5,B000OQF4OM,"The original CGR reviews are still funny and it was interesting to get some backstory on these guys, the old website and how the reviews were made on a shoestring budget. Worth the money if you're a fan.",1375142400,,203,4.368421052631579
2799110,5,B000OQF4OM,"If you like comedy, history, video game stuff, etc, buy this. You will love it. =)

BTW, he has a YouTube channel called

So if you enjoy the movie, check out what he has been doing since then. :3",1373587200,,203,4.025
2799111,5,B000OQF4OM,"It's an interesting story about the rise and fall of The Game Room. If you are interested in the show or video production, this will be interesting to you.",1364860800,,155,4.379310344827586
2799112,5,B000OQF4OM,"If you're a fan of Classic Game Room, then this is the show for you! Mark talks of the past and why the show was shut down. A lot of past episodes were played, and it really showed the roots to the show. I wish I bought this, but getting to watch it for a week is worth it. Have a beer, sit down, and enjoy the show! I'm glad to see Classic Game Room back up and stronger than ever.",1358985600,4,382,3.728395061728395
2799113,2,B000OQF4OM,"I suppose if you are already a fan of this ill fated show, you may enjoy this video. Its mostly just replay of a few episodes with some commentary in between. Just a couple of guys in the early days of internet video who had little talent and personality. If you are expecting any insight into how internet video podcasts came to be or how this show evolved, you will be sorely disappointed. If you just want to see some long clips of this old show, you may enjoy it.

The main problem with this video is you will be much better off just going to YouTube and watching old episodes.  There is nothing in this video worth paying for. Although I enjoy the show (especially in resent years) I don't find the clips from these older shows insightful in any way. Childish humor that is not well put together. I checked it out because I was in the mood for a documentary about classic games and the beginnings of these types of shows. There is nothing here that satisfies those interested.  I don't find the hosts anywhere near as funny as they think they are. One of them just stares bug-eyed into the camera for most of the episodes and its plain annoying. The other host (Mark Bussler) is clearly more capable and low key which has become the signature of the *new* Classic Game Room shows but IMO did not fit well with the ranting and loud presentation of the show in the beginning.",1356998400,4,1378,4.375
2799114,5,B000OQF4OM,"I enjoyed this video cause of the nostalgia of seeing the old games being reviewed by people that share the same enthusiasm and joy for video games as myself.
I also like the humour and the creative thinking behind all of the reviews, even though it was a low budget show they really made the most of it.
Luckily the game room still lives on through youtube.
All hail Lord Karnage!",1285545600,11,381,4.380281690140845
2799115,5,B000OQF4OM,Good video explaining the rise and fall of the popular youtube video game review show CGR in their early days as internet pod casters,1283731200,2,133,4.583333333333333
2799116,5,B000OQF4OM,"""This has got to be for me the greatest video game review show that I have seen for it's time. It was funny and great but sadly I was not there when it first premiered back then in 1999-2000 because I was only about 6-7 years old back then and my computer back then had Windows 95 and was really slow. I recommend this for people who like video games in their entertainment and I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes old classic video games and comedy."" Except the only problem I have with this is that amazon.com is charging you $[...] for this. Go to [...] and get it $[...] cheaper.",1257292800,10,595,4.228070175438597
8186283,5,B000OQF4OM,"I've been a Classic Game Room fan since I was a freshman in high school many years ago, and I always remember seeing the trailer for this. Finally, after 6 years of wondering if I'd ever get the chance to see this, I can say it was worth the wait. I loved this documentary from the classic episodes of The Game Room to the background info and behind the scenes stuff that went on. To think I was 14 when I saw the trailer for this. I'm 20 now and this reminded me of the good times I had watching Classic Game room in high school. Mark Bussler is an excellent video maker even to this day and this documentary shows the abilities he's always had.",1514332800,,646,4.134920634920635

See how Mark Bussler created the Intergalactic Space Arcade from the ashes that was the Game Room and Dave. If you're a fan of the Youtube channel, it's a must buy!",1436054400,,302,4.315789473684211

8186292,3,B000OQF4OM,"This was a great movie and documentary in my opinion. I love Classic Game Room, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Dreamcast. I saw some of my favorite reviews in that DVD. It is a shame the show was cancelled in Late October of 2000. I saw some clips from some episodes like Dead or Alive 2 for Dreamcast and Syphon Filter 2 for the Sony PlayStation. They didn't even review Dead or Alive 2 on the DVD and Syphon Filter 2 on the DVD. It was a great show. The last review they did before the show was cancelled was SeaMan for the Dreamcast. Over an okay DVD. I didn't ever know about Classic Game Room until 2010. The show was originally called The Game Room.",1384041600,,654,4.24
