4375069,5,B004H2S6MQ,"This set is a must-have if you're over 40, looking to get fit, and are inactive.  We have been walking with Leslie Sansone for over a year now, doing two miles a day.  However, we found our muscles fatigued and recovery time was slow.  Because of our age (60), we decided we may need less stress on our bodies, so we ordered this set, and I'm glad we did.

You get four videos, so there is something for everyone.  Walk for Seniors is a bit slow for us right now, but it won't be in a few years.  However, if we had not been doing the two mile walk every day, perhaps this would have been the one to start with.  We found that two videos work out perfectly for us:  the 40 Plus Workout and the Older Adults Walk.  Each video is only about 30 minutes long, so that fits perfectly with our schedule, as well.  The movements are not stressful on the body in either of these, something we were having issues with in many of the other walk workouts.

The Weight Loss Walk, while good, simply does not fit our schedule because in order to do the whole workout, a one hour block of time is needed.  We have considered doing this one on weekends, though, because, again, it is not too stressful on the joints or muscles.

If you're having a hard time finding a workout that you are comfortable with, one that is not too stressful on the joints or muscles, then you should consider getting this set.  Overall, this video series is perfect for an older adult.  While we consider ourselves fairly active, it's a fact that as our bodies age, they simply cannot take the stress of an extremely vigorous workout.  If you're extremely fit already, then this set probably isn't the one for you.  If you're young and extremely overweight or have never exercised before, then this set would be perfect for you.  If you're like us, older, somewhat fit, this set is ideal.  Tipping the scales at just a little over $7 for each video, you can't go wrong.",1341014400,35,1933,4.349162011173185

4375076,1,B004H2S6MQ,"wasn't what I wanted; I wanted her walking videos that I've had and viewed before.  also, the video pauses/stops occassionally which is why I got rid of my older DVDs.  Disappointed and would not recommend",1417996800,,205,4.828571428571428

4375079,5,B004H2S6MQ,"This DVD far exceeded my expectations of a seniors' workout. At first I thought it might be too tame, but after the warm up, I realized it was exactly what I wanted and needed in a workout. I am 68 and try to work out regularly, so an indoor workout that one enjoys is a must have. Thank you Leslie Sandsone.",1402617600,3,308,4.065573770491803
4375080,5,B004H2S6MQ,I can't do the strenuous excecises I did when I was 30 something or even 40 or 50 something. Love this.  The routines vary and are more gentle for my osteo-arthritis.,1402531200,6,166,4.354838709677419

4375082,5,B004H2S6MQ,bought it for my sister and she loves it. It helps her with her exercises. she watches them every day thank you,1381363200,,111,4.090909090909091
4375083,5,B004H2S6MQ,"Lately I have been collecting a lot of exercise DVDs especially Leslie.  I was happy to find this (4) pack and when I begin watching the very first one, I thought I had finally found the ""one"" to be exercising with in the beginner range.  The set is a great value!
Thank you.",1379894400,3,275,4.169811320754717

4375085,4,B004H2S6MQ,"Bought these for my grandma for Christmas, she seems to like them. She's 78 and doesn't get out of bed that often so its just her speed and when I do them with her it gives me a slight pump.",1364774400,,190,3.775
4375086,5,B004H2S6MQ,"I have been using this tape for a long time and think that it is very well made and should be used by
any gender and age. I really enjoy how Leslie makes you feel like you are there with her and doing the
exercises. I like how it takes you through the different miles and when I get through, I feel tired, but
also that I got a good workout and look forward to exercising with her when ever I can't go to the health
fitness center to workout, like in bad weather.",1361836800,5,463,3.9361702127659575
4375087,4,B004H2S6MQ,"Since I qualify for ""older adult"", and have a heart condition, the video is excellent.  It is not difficult at all, and does get in some upper body exercise as well.  I work with it two or three times weekly.  It's good to have some choices for people of our age. I appreciate being able to find it online. Leslie Sansone is an enthusiastic leader.",1360972800,2,348,4.323076923076923
4375088,4,B004H2S6MQ,Haven't tried all four yet but the one I have tried is ideal for me.  Would recommend to older folk who are unable to walk outdoors.,1360281600,,132,4.076923076923077
4375089,5,B004H2S6MQ,"I'm a Leslie Sansone Fan, so these were added to my collection even though Leslie's exercise is based on 4 basic steps I love having a variety of her video's because of the different people and places she does them. These are some what older versions when Leslie was younger. Even still they all give a good workout. I will say that if you are an advanced walker some may be a little on the slow side, but I use those on the days when I want to go easy.  Some do complain about Leslie's talking to much during her exercise, but I find what she says as health education she not just directing excercise. I have learned quite a bit since I have been doing her videos.  Thank You",1358985600,9,676,4.1923076923076925
8429272,4,B004H2S6MQ,"The tape was good and exactly what I wanted, but it seems most any kind of activity causes me knee pain.",1520553600,,104,4.0
8429273,3,B004H2S6MQ,"Was disappointed in 2 of these videos. 2 of them I like very much. The one that is a 2 mile walk is way to fast. I was disappointed at the pace of this. I was afraid to try the 4 mile after this, but when I did, I found it to be a lot better in the pace, and the pick and choose how many miles you want to walk. The older adult one, The Walk for Seniors AT THE CLUB, is just awful. She talks so much through it that it gets really annoying. I have a lot of her videos from over the years, and she does talk a lot in them, but this one was really bad. The other older adult one is better. I'm sorry I ordered all 4 at once. If I knew how they were, I would have ordered the individually. I'm just going to give the 2 I don't like away.",1519689600,,734,3.6226415094339623
