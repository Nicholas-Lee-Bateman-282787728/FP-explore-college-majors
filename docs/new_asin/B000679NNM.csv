8039729,1,B000679NNM,"The acting in this movie was terrible. I got the distinct feeling that the actors had just walked onto the set on the first day of filming and took a quick look at the script for the first time and hour before going in front of the camera.

The writing was even worse than the acting. Someone researched various aspects of the occult and threw them all together in one film, mixing them in a way that was distorted and unbelievable.

The filming is terrible.

Don't waste your time watching this one. Anyone over the age of about 10-12 would find it intolerable.",1355616000,,562,4.436893203883495
8039730,5,B000679NNM,"Outstanding overall performances.  Actor Chase Carpenter really shines in this one.  He was definitely snubbed by the 2004 academy, and at least deserved an oscar nomination for an actor in a suporting role.  For more of Carpenter's work, see The Ghost Club and The Last Summer, both tremendous efforts by this up-and-coming actor.",1215820800,3,331,5.2075471698113205
8039731,3,B000679NNM,"This is sort of between a two and a three, though closer to two. Lame-ish story, dud-head townspeople, bad-acting uncle (among other bad acting moments). Still, it had a couple of Fango-moments (not to mention a Fango panel that could have used sound enhancement). I think it was worth the rental fee, but I wouldn't buy it.
The teens crash because of a mysterious plague of locusts (or maybe it's moths) during a night-time drive. Instead of raising the windows, they crash and hence come to the Marques school, which has one groundskeeper and a lot of lawn to mow, all things considered. They are told it's too far to drive them to the hospital, over 20 miles I think, but nobody really makes the connection when the groundskeeper can walk it to get auto parts.
The assistant headmistress was totally unbelievable, but her false smile reminded me of a school guidance counselor or family psychologist.
The end was seriously hokey and had me laughing out loud for the goofiness of it. Predictable, but hey, a laugh's a laugh.
I upped the star content because there's a pretty nice piece of eye candy (Richard Crenna's son) and because it had me screaming in gross-out at what they do to one of his body parts.
I don't like slasher films and don't knowningly venture into that genre. I am totally bored with the whole concept of Let's Kill All The Teenagers. So I am sure there are movies out there with more realistic stabbings, slashings and dismemberments. I haven't seen them so I can't compare.
I did kind of like the implication that the school was a fortress from the time of the Conquistadores. A little different from your basic 'Based On English Gothic' style house.
Don't expect fine art, but it's worth a bowl of popcorn.",1163376000,2,1733,4.666666666666667
8039732,1,B000679NNM,"Here we go again:  five young college students (although one's only 14, so it's really only 4 I guess) stumble into a mysterious academy that the viewer knows is not what it seems.  With a script that seems written by a high school creative writer and a cast of unknowns who will probably stay unknown, ONE OF THEM manages to be boring, derivative and as chilling as a can of sardines.  While trying to use gore as a diversion, the movie fails to generate any scares and one has to wonder why any studio would finance it.  Pity that the late Richard Crenna's son had to get involved.  With his rugged good looks and a smidgeon of talent, he deserves better.",1125532800,3,657,4.396694214876033
8039733,1,B000679NNM,"When they came up with the title, if the filmmakers meant the seemingly endless stock of poor genre films that are being pumped out in the wake of digital film-making, then this is indeed ""one of them"". This cheap, irritating and boring ""horror"" film tries to be a combination of Final Destination and the Skulls.

Viewers are treated to horrible lighting and dismal video quality. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bunch of teenagers who are being hunted by other dead teenagers. I wish I could be more specific, but the story was so confusing and badly written that I am hard pressed to tell you what this movie was about. I just wish that I had bypassed this one altogether.",1120003200,3,679,4.520325203252033
8039734,1,B000679NNM,"'One Of Them' could possibly be the worst movie ever made.  It is ill conceived, poorly executed, the film quality is pathetic, and it probably has some of the most atrocious acting ever put onto celluloid.

The plot revolves around some annoying kids whose car wrecks due to a locust attack(which, by the way, is never explained).  After the accident, they find themselves in the infirmary of a private boarding school inhabited by some evil people.  We know they are evil because they all wear black.  Also, a student of the school recently died under suspicious circumstances and her uncle is investigating her death.  There is no explaination as to who the evil folks at the school are, why they are evil, or what they are even doing in general.  The plot is about the thinnest I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in a film.

Every actor(and I use the term actor in its loosest possible meaning)is pathetic.  Every single one of them is horrible.  There is not a single line of dialogue uttered that won't make you cringe.

Since this is a horror flick(again, the term is loosely used)there is the required gore.  All the violence is pretty kindergarten, most of which is laughable.  The only decent shot in the entire film is when one of the annoying kid's eyeballs gets slashed.  Other than that two second shot, the other hour and a half is complete rubbish.

'One Of Them' is just about the worst movie ever made.  Avoid it like the plauge.  This film is so bad it is not even amusing to watch and mock.  It simply irritates you to the point of breaking.  It is simply irritating and so poorly executed that it should be pulled from every shelf it is on.

If you want to see a great low budget horror flick, check out 'Dead Birds' or 'Dog Soldiers' instead.",1116028800,3,1769,4.537974683544304
8039735,1,B000679NNM,"Oh, where to Begin. It probably didn't help watching the movie ""Toolbox Murders"" just before this one (which is a half way decent horror movie.) Anyway, (1) REALLY bad acting. Some people say it, but in this movie, its an understatement. (2) DVD quality isn't so hot. Its kind of foggy, like a VHS. (3) Really bad FX's - a lot of cheap Halloween store gags and props. Blood too bright and to thin to be blood (looks like that new liquid candy), meal worms bought from a pet store to look like maggots. Very generic lizard tongues and green eyes coming out of people. ITS BAD! (4) IT IS PAINFULLY BORING - I could not take anymore. I started skimming through it with my remote. Even on high speed DVD skimming, the action NEVER picks up.",1112572800,,736,4.37956204379562
