803802,4,6304153716,"Actually, I give this Goosebumps video 4 1/2 stars. I have seen all of the Goosebumps videos, and this may very well actually be the best one.  The only one I really didn't like was ""Stay Out of the Basement."" I did like ""The Werewolf of Fever Swamp."" I really liked ""Welcome To Deadhouse,"" ""The Haunted Mask,"" and ""The Haunted Mask Part 2."" But if I had to choose the best, I would have to say this is the one. Like good horror, the movie STARTS normal and harmless. Gradually, some spooky things start to happen. One fine thing about this video is that a harmless practical joke (""We tour guides have to have some fun"") foreshadows the horror to come. It's hard for me to talk about this without ruining the surprise, but I will do my best. Things go along normal for some time, but then spooky things start to happen. The setting of the tower provides a wonderful background for an alternation of fear between real threats to Eddie and Sue and trivial objects that just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Without ruining this video for you, I will say that it will keep you guessing. The greatest thing about this video is that while their are some really implausible events, (such as a journey far away Eddie and Sue will take), the implausible events eventually lead the way to a tragic event that ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN in 1483. Once this is established, we stop worrying about the implausible aspects of this story, and we are able to concentrate on the horror that DID ACTUALLY HAPPEN in history. I don't want to ruin the final scene, but I will say we are given a great combination of relief and sudden fear. The scenery is wonderful and the movie will keep you in suspense. Another thing I must compliment is the smooth transition between scenes and locations, and scenes where we think one thing, and then start to realize another. If you like the Goosebumps, you absolutely MUST have this video tape.",998524800,6,1925,4.5

804040,3,6304153716,"The Goosebumps TV series, based on the books by R.L. Stine, aired in the late 1990s and is famous for it's low-budget special effects, bad acting, and bad script adaptions.

In the Perfect School Part 1 & 2, Brian O'Connor gets shipped off to a private military like school, after his parents got tired of him picking on his younger brother, not cleaning his room, and his falling grades. The students that graduate from the school are perfect, too perfect. As the school is cloning the students and sending the clones back home.

Perfect School is one of the worst adapted episodes from R.L. Stine's books. The sets are horrible, the acting is dreadful, and the dialogue is laughable. There is a twisted ending but it is predictable.

Younger kids may like the Perfect School, while older kids and adults may have trouble getting through it.",1346457600,,842,4.7534246575342465

Sue and her brother Eddie are on a tour of Terror Tower in London. They briefly time travel back to medieval times and return to present time. When the arrive back at their hotel, there is no record that their parents every checked in.

This DVD also includes the two-part episodes Stay Out of the Basement in which Margaret and her little brother are worried about their father who is acting very odd. He spends all his free time in the basement working on his experiments with plants.

I bought these episodes on VHS back in the 90s and it is nice to finally own them on DVD. Both kids and adults will enjoy watching these spooky episodes.",1346284800,,834,4.367741935483871
804042,4,6304153716,"This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.

There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.

Here we get the two part episode Deep Trouble, in which brother and sister, Billy and Sheena, are visiting their uncle Dr. Deep on a small island in the Caribbean. Billy is all excited about having an island adventure, that is until he comes face to face with a half-human, half-fish creature.

Deep Trouble is in the style of 50s and 60s B-Movies. Little kids will like this adventure tale.",1346112000,2,769,4.598540145985401

804044,5,6304153716,"GOOSEBUMPS: A NIGHT IN TERROR TOWER includes three episodes of the GOOSEBUMPS tv series from the mid-1990s.

""A Night in Terror Tower"" - Sue and Ed are touring London while their parents are off at some conference. The two children begin seeing things at the Tower that apparently aren't there. They also keep getting behind the rest of the group and soon find themselves being chased by a mysterious man in black. Who is the man and why is he chasing Sue and Ed? This episode is of note for two particular reasons. The first is that the events are loosely based upon real, historic people, Prince Edward & Prince Richard and their imprisonment in the Tower of London by their Uncle, Richard III. The second reason this episode is noteworthy is that it is bookended by an introduction and concluding remarks by R.L. Stine, ala William Castle.

""Stay Out of the Basement Pts. 1 & 2"" - Margaret and Casey Brewer are left at home with their botanist father when their mother has to go visit her injured sister. Mr. Brewer hasn't exactly been himself lately as he is busy working on a very ""hush-hush"" experiment. However, his behavior continues to become more and more bizarre and the kids begin to suspect that something has happened in the basement to affect their father.

GOOSEBUMPS: A NIGHT IN TERROR TOWER is an excellent ""Goosebumps"" collection. All three episodes contain just the right mix of humor and thrills that originally made ""Goosebumps"" so popular. This is a DVD that not only fans of  ""Goosebumps"" will enjoy, but is a great compilation to introduce newcomers to the ""Goosebumps"" series.",1327536000,12,1602,4.772563176895307
804045,5,6304153716,I bought this as a birthday gift for a very much so loved goosebumps fan he was very happy with the product,1324771200,,107,3.909090909090909
804112,5,6304153716,"Who would've ever thought that one of the best Goosebumps episodes ever is based on a 10-page short story? An interesting, but rushed, storyline was turned into a suspenseful, cleverly woven two-part (45 min.) episode. You can only do so much in a TV series that's aimed for kids, but this episode is top-notch for its kind...and it has appeal for adults.

Brian is a teenager who's made fun of his little brother one too many times, so his parents send him to ""The Perfect School"" to learn some manners. The place is run like a prison, where obedience and conformity are used to make kids behave. More intriguing are both the security and the stern, no-nonsense headmaster, who's uptight and has no patience for trouble. Brian makes some acquaintances, but it's hard to trust certain people in this strange place. Something is odd about The Perfect School and its watchful eye. Brian doesn't want to be perfect and tries to escape, and he's about to learn the shocking secret of what happens to such kids...

There are many things that make this episode work. It's probably the most mainstream TV episode in the series - instead of monsters and dummies (which are cool, but for a younger crowd), this is about a gloomy school where you either conform to the rules or pay the consequences. Therefore, some adults will enjoy it too. Also, Brian is a smart and highly likeable character. The villain (headmaster) is a memorable one because he's just a person...he chooses to be evil. Further, the suspense of both uncertainty and escape quicken the pace and tension. You could even see the episode as an attack on surveillance and forced comformity. To top it off, the climax and twist ending are near brilliant.

If you like the series or want to check out an engaging horror-suspense TV episode that the whole family can enjoy, this is perfect for you.",1283644800,,1852,4.727554179566564

Perfect for halloween.  My 5 1/2 year old enjoys goosebumps and for her, she can tolerate most of the goosebumps series as long as we are with her watching them, of course (no nightmares either). She has her older friends, 7 and 10 years old hooked on them.  Can't say all kids would enjoy these series.  If your child likes harmless scary movies then they will like goosebumps movies because most episodes are about 1/2 each (usually 2 episodes to a dvd)so just enough time to keep the attention span and the situations are not over the top.
