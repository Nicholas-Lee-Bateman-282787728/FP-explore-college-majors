I love it! I think it is brilliant. This film has BALLS and is highly original. If you can recall your first reaction to titles like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Trainspotting', than you may have an idea of what it is like. In recent years we have gone through many different ideas in animation, ranging from big money makers like Pixar's creations, all the way to well known, and loved by some (including myself), british humor of Wallace and Gromit. This movie is another fresh approach, with the slight difference that it was intended for grown-ups....whatever that means. Think of it this way - it is not offered here in region 4, so maybe they (distributors) don't want to spread it USA - that usually is a first sign of something actually worth watching :)

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did, and if you want to explore some more of new animation, check out ""Mary and Max"" - a masterpiece from Australia. Cheers!",1264723200,4,1033,4.4603174603174605
