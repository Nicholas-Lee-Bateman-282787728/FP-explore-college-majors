8613109,4,B00F8MJEB6,"This year's film noir festival at the AFI Theater near Washington, D.C. features international films in order to show that noir is not a uniquely American genre.  I had the good fortune to see this 1949 French noir film, known by two titles: ""Riptide"" and the more appropriate and evocative ""Such a Pretty Little Beach"" on a large screen as part of the festival.  In addition, I heard noir film critic and author Alan Rode introduce the movie.  At least in the United States, the film is a rarity. The film is not readily accessible on DVD and at the theater showing, nobody in the audience, consisting of largely of noir fans, had seen it.

This black-and-white film is set in a small coastal village in northern France just after WW II.  Atmosphere in nor film is all-important.  In ""Such a Pretty Little Village"" it is raining incessantly over a small dismal beach. There is a little town with crabbed, small shops but most of the action takes place on the beach and in an old run-down hotel.  It is not tourist season and with the dismal weather and lack of attractions, there are few guests.

The movie centers upon a sad, young man, known as Pierre, who arrives at the hotel for a stay.  He claims to be a student who wants a place to rest to get over his case of ""nerves"" and stress. As the film develops, Pierre shows himself oddly familiar with the hotel, the beach, and the environs.  An aged, ill man at the hotel, unable to speak due to sickness appears to recognize Pierre. As the movie develops, Pierre interacts with the greedy woman who operates the hotel, a maid named Marthe, an older man who arrives as a guest in the hotel, and a servant orphan boy, The recordings of a French chanteuse play an important part in the film. The film develops slowly and subtly. The nature of Pierre's nerves, guilt, and sadness gradually come out.

The movie stars a young Gerard Phillipe as Pierre in what was his second film. In his introduction, Alan Rode compared Phillipe to the American actor James Dean in his brooding, youthful, and lonely persona. The comparison was apt for Phillipe's portrayal of the troubled loner Pierre in this film. Phillipe (1922 -- 1959) has a longer career than Dean which included 34 films made during the years 1947 -- 1959.  Phillip is also a cultural hero in France and in Germany as well with commemorative coins, festivals, streets, and schools named in his honor.

""Such a Pretty Little Beach"" has a distinctively noir scene with its chilly setting and its tormented primary character. I enjoyed seeing the film on a large screen and getting to know something about Gerard Phillipe and French noir. Admirers of noir or of French film will enjoy seeing ""Such a Pretty Little Beach"" if they have the opportunity to do so.  As of this writing, Amazon has a trailer available on the webpage for this movie.  The trailer is for a 1934 British film called ""Riptide"" and not for this 1949 French film.
