2084411,4,B0002ERWUA,My child has autism and has learned from watching videos.  He enjoys this show and it encourages self-esteem and competence.  He enjoys watching the children and the puppets.  The songs and sentences are simple and it's easy to learn the lyrics.,1162512000,3,245,4.926829268292683
2084412,3,B0002ERWUA,"My son loves the curious buddies videos.  He would probably watch this one more but I don't like playing it cause the voice of one of the singers sounds very very creepy to me.  I play the ""let's build"" curious buddies video all the time.  The whole family likes that one.",1157673600,5,272,4.294117647058823
2084413,5,B0002ERWUA,"My 20-month old has given up Baby Einstein for the Curious Buddies. He watches one half-hour video per day, and I was looking for something new at our local discount store when I found this one. I was skeptical, but after the first viewing, the Curious Buddies are the new favorite at our house. The music is cute, not cheesey, and I like that he is learning about objects around our house. He's enthralled every time he watches. Definitely a good choice!",1145577600,5,455,4.560975609756097
2084414,5,B0002ERWUA,My daughter loves all of the Curious Buddies DVD's! We are now adding this one to the list!!!!! Very entertaining for her.,1127174400,2,122,4.590909090909091
2084415,5,B0002ERWUA,"My 15 month old LOVES this whole series.  The music is great and the puppets are cute!  I like that it uses real people with a lot of babies.  My son won't sit still for anything on TV, but he begs to put these on and then won't leave the room until it's over.  Let me recommend you get the whole set so you don't get tired of hearing the same one over & over.",1124755200,7,360,3.76

2084417,5,B0002ERWUA,"My daughter is 2 and for some reason I thought this might bore her. I rented it from our local library to try it out first and she LOVES this movie!! I was thinking it might be obnoxious or annoying for me but it's fun dancing or playing along with the movie. Very cute, very calm and good music! She loves it and I now love it. :) It's not long - just long enough for her to stay interested and it shows her other children helping around the house.",1123632000,8,449,4.0
2084418,5,B0002ERWUA,"Excellent movie, keeps the kids attention while playing decent music for them to listen to.  Very funny and cute, both my 1 and 4 year old enjoy this one.",1109116800,2,154,4.310344827586207
2084419,5,B0002ERWUA,"My 13 month old son is only allowed to watch a select few dvd's that we rotate for him as we like them to be somewhat educational but still entertaining for him.  I was  a bit wary of the Nickelodeon Baby presents and thought it might be cheesy but this is one of the best videos for older babies I've seen.

These are not the spinny shiny objects to classical music videos like some of the Baby Einstein videos (though we love Baby MacDonald/Neighborhood Animals & Neptune)  but instead features really cute puppets and very simple but extremely appropriate real life video lessons that clearly repeat and name the actions or objects they are trying to teach the baby (like can you help Cat find the APPLE? and slowly goes over three fruits with the puppet until YES he finds the apple!)  And real life video of toddlers helping their parents or siblings around the house.  The music is pretty cool too and as a former music biz exec. I am super picky about kids music.  GREAT video - Have ordered the rest of the series as of now.",1095465600,16,1032,4.428571428571429

2084435,5,B0002ERWUA,"My children (ages 7,5,& 2) all love the Curious Buddies videos...and this is a favorite. The doggie bath scene always elicits lots of giggles! I appreciate the great concepts it teaches of children helping parents around the house, and especially, siblings helping and looking out for siblings.",1391212800,,294,5.276595744680851
2084436,4,B0002ERWUA,It's a really cute movie that actually teaches. I wish it was longer but the songs are cute and catchy that even I sing along.,1369612800,,126,4.08

2084439,5,B0002ERWUA,"I try to avoid television and videos as much as possible for my kids.  Most of what is geared at our youngest children these days is bothersome to me.  Curious buddies is one program that I love and don't mind them watching at all.  We now have three different CB videos. My two year old absolutely loves them and goes through every motion along with the videos.  They are cute, fun, educational, active and a wonderful choice should you opt for some screen time for your little one.",1363305600,,483,4.454545454545454
2084450,5,B0002ERWUA,My 2 yr old loves these shows.  They are entertaining as well as educational and even I don't mind watching them over and over.  The puppets sound like they are voiced by children which is nice.,1327017600,,194,4.361111111111111
2084451,5,B0002ERWUA,My daughter and I Love the Curious Buddies! This is a cute little video about helping around the house. There are cute songs to sing while you are doing certain things like folding clothes and washing the car. You might find yourself singing them too!,1315008000,,251,4.6
2084452,3,B0002ERWUA,"This is a decent DVD... but my son way prefers the Curious Buddies ""Let's Build"". This one seems to bore him, just can't keep his interest. Maybe girls would like this one better, who knows.",1253145600,,190,4.457142857142857
2084453,5,B0002ERWUA,"My 21 month old daughter loves this movie. She watches it a lot. She just started watching TV/Movies. I like the lessons it teaches. I agree, it's for the younger kids, but my 5 yr old boy actually watches parts of it with her sometimes. I want him to learn from it, since he doesn't like to help out, so it's great!",1217548800,,316,4.112903225806452
2084454,3,B0002ERWUA,"The front and back covers of the DVD case show kids/puppets with laundry, yet the DVD does not have a laundry segment.  The scenes that are shown are good: cleaning room, giving baby brother a bath, making fruit salad in kitchen, reading little sister a book, washing dog...; BUT, since my house resembles a small laundry factory, I was hoping my toddler would get a glimpse of children helping with the entire laundry process.  There is a short clip of a child carrying a laundry basket, but it's not an extended viewing of the laundry chore.  There is a TERRIBLE segment with the Buddies puppets taking a bath.  Yawn - it's approximately 5 minutes long (seems like an eternity); and I wonder what the point is - it's not funny, it's not educational.  In fact, my 2 year old always whines during the segment.  There is a boring animated sock matching exercise - match red sock with red sock, etc.  Overall, the DVD is good if your toddler has grown out of Baby Einstein.  The writers/directors of this DVD got close...but fell short of being great...I give it a ""good"" rating.",1191542400,,1077,4.602094240837697
2084455,3,B0002ERWUA,"The DVD itself isn't that funny or entertaining for an adult, but just wait until it's over.  For the next hour or so, your toddler will be so sugary and accommodating, you'll be happy when it wears off and you have your usual howler-monkey back.  It makes you appreciate your rude little cave-babies while possibly imparting some lasting lessons about manners and cleaning up toys to them. The puppets are of the same ilk as those on Jack's Big Music Show (same production company), but the writing, voicework and music are not.  This will not entertain anyone older than five.  It shouldn't have to, but with Jack, that's a bonus.",1184371200,,632,4.718181818181818
2084456,4,B0002ERWUA,"This was upbeat and fun for my 18 month old.  She really liked it, but seemed to lose interest before the end.  I've been letting her watch it during quiet time in the afternoon recently and now she watches the entire video and asks to watch it again.  I've grown to like it more now than I did when I first previewed it and it's a bonus that she also seems more interested in it now too!",1179273600,2,388,4.012987012987013
2084457,3,B0002ERWUA,"I was interested in buying the series because my daughter was dancing to a commercial but once i purchased the dvd, my daughter wasn't too attntive to it. Her interest lasted no more than a week, so it was a waste of money.",1173312000,2,223,4.209302325581396
2084458,5,B0002ERWUA,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter will watch this while I get dishes washed or dinner ready.  It's cute and teaches her good things, and she loves the music.",1167955200,2,150,4.172413793103448
