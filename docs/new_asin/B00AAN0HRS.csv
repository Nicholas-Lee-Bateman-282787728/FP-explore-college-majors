5406370,4,B00AAN0HRS,"I am looking for a film to open a discussion on growth...there are some who believe growth is always good.  They tend to be people who profit from building..Does it matter that they build on wetlands...How do we find the right balance between growth and housing...How many malls is too many?

Not your average dark documentary - it is funny and even a bit silly now and then.  Hopefully it will set the right tone for a civil discussion.",1356998400,7,437,4.506329113924051
5406371,5,B00AAN0HRS,"We can continue to fight and lose at 10,000 points of environmental darkness, or we can see the light of true sustainably as an overarching issue. ""GrowthBusters: Hooked on Growth"" offers the hope of a real and practical solution to our cultural and environmental dilemma.  See it to feel better and do good. There is a way.",1354579200,7,324,4.684210526315789
5406372,5,B00AAN0HRS,"This is a great little film with a straightforward message: It's OK to be against growth.

Some might say this film goes too far, but if anything, we will have to take its arguments further. The film draws out the limitations of a growth economy and shows the very real factors underlying our growth predicament. This would be a great film for students, because it can spark debates and get students thinking about new kinds of economic thinking. I fear the economy their parents' generation bequeathed them is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.

Already looking forward to Growth Busters II!

Update: After a couple months, this film still sticks in my mind - the sign of a great film in my mind.",1354492800,6,696,4.642276422764228
8549242,5,B00AAN0HRS,GrowthBusters contains much information that is not in other environmental documentaries. Such as the problem of including ovepopulation issues in popular environmental documentaries. And the 1972 report by the Club of Rome--basically that we are using up 1-1/2 earths already.,1487548800,,277,5.95

8549244,4,B00AAN0HRS,"This has the just right amount of ""doom"" + moderate length to get people's attention without threatening their egos. Mass denial on this topic demands a different approach and this could be the right formula. A lot of the denial thrives on the idea that anyone who seems pessimistic about human behavior must be ignored, no matter how much evidence there is. It really comes down to ignorance of math.

Those who've been following this topic for decades might find it watered down but it's a good primer for people who've gone through life barely thinking about limits. The featured speakers have a lot more to say elsewhere. I recommend Herman Daly's reviews of Julian Simon's false logic, which is still being pushed by the GOP as common sense.",1407110400,,746,4.782945736434108
8549245,5,B00AAN0HRS,"The host of this film juxtaposes mass media's calls for growth with an alternate vision -- the steady-state economy.  Part of what makes this film unique is that the producer runs a public campaign in his town to see if regular people outside of universities can start to achieve this holy grail of sustainability.  He has mixed results, but viewers get to learn from the process.  The film is peppered with interviews from experts, showing the importance that such a seemingly common-sense idea has achieved.  Just as pacifism is also a simple concept, applying it at the societal level is far more difficult.  GrowthBusters convincingly prompts one to ask:  Is there a better way than unending growth?  Is unending growth going to work out?
For another witty interpretation of this topic (especially on exponential growth and following collapse), there is the book ""The Five Stages of Collapse:  Survivors' Toolkit"" by Dmitry Orlov.",1401494400,,934,5.098684210526316
8549246,5,B00AAN0HRS,"Fantastic documentary. Funny but a serious topic which makes it accessible for everyone. I would recommend
putting on public screenings, inviting neighbors over etc. Everyone seems to accept the concept of continual growth and this
totally disproves it.",1399420800,2,253,5.684210526315789
8549247,5,B00AAN0HRS,"Everyone on the planet should see this film !  Our human race is already struggling for food, fuel and space. We are at the beginning of whole society meltdown. We have maybe a few years yet to turn things round and this film tells us how. Its actually very easy. Stop assuming economic growth is the best way for humans to live. If we all pull back, have less babies, work less hours, go to bed when it gets dark, eat more simply, stay local then our planet may just be able to support our children. Carry on as we are - those babies born now will suffer and die. No brainer really. Highly recommended.",1399334400,,603,4.243478260869566
8549248,5,B00AAN0HRS,"Whether we're talking economics/consumption or human population, perpetual growth isn't really very sustainable is it? Dave Gardner points out the folly of our mass delusions with great humour and insight in this excellent documentary. Along the way he will run for public office on an anti-growth platform, hand out Endangered Species condoms to the public and in an attempt to explain exponential function looks to the lessons of bacteria in a jar.

As science issues ever more more dire predictions and projections, this message becomes ever more vital and important. If any one thing should grow, then let it be the viewing figures for GrowthBusters.",1399334400,,654,5.228571428571429
8549249,5,B00AAN0HRS,"A great introduction into a topic that few are willing to delve into. It is a fact - human beings, mainly those living in developed countries, are depleting the Earth's finite natural resources faster than they can be replenished. Our current standard of living can only go on for so long, so what do we do? This film challenges our long held perspectives with several laughs along the way, and presents viable solutions for us to take away and put into action.",1399248000,,461,4.634146341463414
8549250,5,B00AAN0HRS,"We've all heard of global change through the doom and gloom lens, and though Growthbusters in no way belittles the urgency of overpopulation, David Gardner takes a more personal look at communities and their stories, all the while with laughs.",1399248000,,243,5.1
