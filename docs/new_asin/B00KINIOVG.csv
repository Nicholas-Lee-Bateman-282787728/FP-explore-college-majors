6429921,5,B00KINIOVG,I was fortunate to see this movie during a private showing.  It is one that will keep your interest from the moment it starts until the very end.  Girl on the Train has many twists and turns and definitely keeps you guessing until the last scene.  It will leave you asking more questions about what just happened!  Worth watching more than once.,1403913600,8,345,4.516129032258065

There were obvious differences from how the book is written vs the movie and I wish they could have included more, but it was still very good.

Emily Blunt was simply amazing.",1490140800,,329,3.984848484848485

6429946,4,B00KINIOVG,very interesting movie.,1488412800,,23,7.0
6429947,4,B00KINIOVG,"Henry Ian Cusick plays Danny who is an Englishman making documentaries in the US. One day he sees a girl on a train who has been crying. He is strangely drawn to her and decides to act on his impulses. She is enigmatic and mysterious and he finds himself wanting to see her again.

Then they do meet and she uses her feminine ways to get him to act out of character and take him down a path that once he has set foot on it, there is no turning back.

Now this is a well written, filmed and acted film. There is a lot of clever observations on life and some real chemistry between the main players. The film works by using flash backs to flesh out what has already transpired and it is done rather well. The problem is that it is all a bit too contrived and unbelievable and the dnouement is just a bit too much to be taken seriously so it loses marks big time.",1487894400,,860,4.052941176470588

6429971,3,B00KINIOVG,Strange story.,1485129600,,14,6.5
6429972,1,B00KINIOVG,"Poor,poor production, writing,story and sound effects in a cynically packaged product.  The cover has a woman going under a tunnel(as in the film)
and when you buy it in a shop you think you are buying the popular story(from the novel and film). I can't believe I was suckered into this scam-product of immense inferiority. Once you've removed the packaging you can't take it back. The film can be compared to being taken for a ride as
the documentary film maker is by the young woman on the train. The actors speak in shadow a lot or have their backs to you, so don't matter what you do you can't tap into the impoverished meanings on offer. It's basically about a man picking a woman up on a train, but really she's using him
to get him to do something(I won't say what). It's only 1.25 hours long too. Hitching a 'ride' by the director onto a superior product is so intolerable
otherwise theit film would never had been seen or purchased by the unwary consumer. By the way, no subtitles. Disgusting! Immense pile of
mediocrity disguised as an art film.",1485043200,,1055,4.523560209424084

To me it was borderline ignorant. My advice is to only buy when the price falls to ten bucks. Oh, one thing that really got me upset was the shots of the train going down the track while making the click-clack sound of wheels passing over rail joints. My Lord, how stupid. The rail was continuously welded rail or CWR, also called ribbon rail. It had no joints, hence, it can not make the click-clack noise as the train passes by. Overall, dumb movie.

The dialogue and narration,  which work well in a novel format,  did not translate well at all to the screen. Then the ration is long and tedious, and the dialogue is just too forced.

However, I could not get to the nine minute mark with this film.  The sappy music while the old man over-acted his melodramatic story, the stilted narration by the middle-aged protagonist as he starts his creepy obsessing over an ordinary girl who could be late teens/very early twenties, the artistic direction of the girl's face popping out of the crowd were all just too much for me.

6430710,3,B00KINIOVG,"This ""The Girl on the Train"" movie is a psychological intrigue. The movie has very little action. It is all about the dialogue between a movie maker and a girl he spots on the train. He approaches her and begins a conversation. When she gets off the train, all he knows about her is her name. Some time later, she spots him in the train terminal and approaches him. This begins their friendship and a long series of conversations.

The girl learns about his work, a documentary about a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, and the filming of the Jewish man intertwines with the conversations between the girl and the movie maker, which also intertwines with the movie maker being questioned by the police post-girl. There are glimmers that show the movie maker has been hurt, physically, because of the girl, but we don't know how until the end.

To some, this could be a very boring movie because we are so used to lots of action, but if you can hang with the conversations, the end will blow your mind.

Extremely talkie movie with no real activity no real plot.
The plot is. Guy meets girl on train. What happens after that is basically nothing. That's it. Guy meets girl on the train.  Just writing the review is annoying. Stay clear of this. You will hate yourself once you get invested and are waiting for something. Then you are stuck waiting till the end. And then you will be pissed.
There is a shooting at the end andxtrust me this information ruins nothing and you will wish the gun had been used at whoever released this movie and wasted your life and brain.",1481241600,,770,4.340277777777778

(They expected it to be the Paula Hawkins story by the same name). But really, it's a good movie.  Thoughtful, cerebral, the threads of the story delicately drawn and interwoven. It will keep you thinking about it for a long time.  The movie deals with  how well we can know another human being?  Is what we know of them a story we tell ourselves? And knowing that, is love merely an illusion? It turns these questions around and inside out  as a documentary filmmaker becomes intrigued by a woman he meets on a train.  There is one speech by the woman at the end of the film that is total gobbledegook and should be cut.  But other than that, it's a very well done film. Every time we think it has ended, we get one more glimpse, and another and another that challenges what we know of truth and makes us think.  I suspect the ones who didn't like the film and fell asleep were expecting action adventure.  You have to pay attention and think, but that's what art should call us to do.",1480809600,,1130,4.3428571428571425

Ultimately, the producer, the director, the cast and obviously the writer are all too blas about some poor loser getting shot in the back of the head and having his eye popped out. Murder is getting a tad too ""comme ci comme ca"" in films, and the fading taboo seems to relegate ""the law"" to secondary if not tertiary roles in criminal cases, at least on film.

6431116,3,B00KINIOVG,"I thought this would be a film version of Paula Hawkins's wonderful ""The Girl on the Train,"" but it appears to be something quite different. The narrator is supposed to be Rachel, an alcoholic who rides the same commuter train every day to London and back even though she has lost her job. She spends her time peering into the homes of the people she passes as the train whizzes by--she imagines or in fact sees a man and woman fighting and the woman disappears--the book is about perception. Is she a reliable narrator, or has alcohol so seeped into her being that her view of reality can no longer be trusted? The movie is ridiculous. The narrator is a male; the girl on the train is a perfectly sane (it turns out) murderer--it just doesn't work--even the setting has changed. The plot takes place in New York, not London--it's all topsy turvy. I saw this had a bad review in T New York Times, but I wanted to give it a chance. If you want to watch a C grade mystery viewed from the perspective of a man who can't be sure what he is seeing, then rent it and enjoy it for what it is.

Suspenseful, but not an on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller.  More subtle, not over the top, or campy... which was a good change of pace, from this genre.  Might've been overly edited... or perhaps, budget restraints kept the chacters being explored more in depth... any less, and they would've fallen flat.  Admittedly, I'll watch anything, in which either actor plays... so, a somewhat biased review, I'm afraid.

So many of us live alternate lives in our mind but never take that step an bring the make believe self to life. I've done it. One time I was at a coctail party at the house of a girl I was dateing. I was dressed all in black. When asked what I did for a living, I thought, what if I were different from all the other guests at the party. Everyone worked in a little cube, for some large corporate organization, dressed pretty much like everyone else, and did the same thing day after day.  Who knows you might do that now. Back to my story, so when asked I told them that I was an  Catholic Priest. I told them that I know longer preformed the duties of a Priest but told them that once a Priest - always a Priest . Just like getting an MBA from some School of Business, you may no longer do what you were trained to do but you'll always be an MBA. Yes, I lied to these people but it was so much fun and interesting. At the end of the evening I told them all the truth and we all had a laugh over it. No one was hurt, but for a couple of hours I was some one else.

As the movie progressed it became less and less believable, and by the last quarter,  I was exasperated with the mindless babbling as if they were intellectuals, and apparently the writer/director figured the audience was too illiterate (or sleeping) to notice nothing was making much sense any more.  Were we supposed to not notice or be impressed by the ramblings?  Not here.

However, it is not the current film of the same title.",1478131200,,76,4.5
6431930,4,B00KINIOVG,"Overall this is a good (but not great) movie.  Following the plot in the beginning is difficult so pay close attention.  Midway through, just when you think you have the plot figured out, the movie takes several unexpected twists.  The ending is very much a surprise.  Good acting, good sets and good directing.  I recommend Girl on the Train for those who like twisted plots.",1478131200,,376,4.723076923076923

6431935,1,B00KINIOVG,"Awful movie, with revolting digressions on love, the stupidest dialogues, so pretentious, so unnecessary. The actors are pretty bad and unconvincing. A woman finds an accomplice in someone who was looking for perfect love and uses him to secure an inheritance and get rid of her abuser. It tries to be gripping, but you just watching hoping that something interesting will happen to make it worthwhile. But nothing happens. A pathetic waste of time.",1478044800,4,449,5.081081081081081

6431945,2,B00KINIOVG,"Couldn't even finish it - it was a bit too into itself and too clever by half while still indulging in some hackneyed tropes (I guess there aren't really any other kind).  Felt like a train commuter's fantasy and just as realistic.  Also, dude - don't sit next to some random woman on the train, trapping her in her seat, when there are open seats everywhere.  That's super creepy, not romantic.  Not cool, man, not cool.  They seemed to be going for the classic documentarian shots, so those made sense in context.  The sound was fine.  I have pretty eclectic tastes and can usually enjoy most movies, but this one just wasn't doing it for me.  It seems to have floated other people's boats though, so who knows?",1478044800,7,713,4.515625

Don't listen to some people, who never can truly understand the difference between love, soulmates, logic, vengeance and hate. It's a masterpiece in my humble opinion, somehow it reminds me of a movie ""no man's land"". You might have to watch it twice to really cast an opinion.

6432117,3,B00KINIOVG,I can't understand how the male lead would have ever fallen in love with the female lead. She was so unlikable! The whole thing was sort of unbelievable and contrived.,1477526400,,167,4.6
6432118,1,B00KINIOVG,To allow a viewer to enjoy a movie there must be characters that you care about.  This movie contained no such characters and the unbelievable plot did not allow an easy telling of the story.,1477526400,,191,4.457142857142857

6432129,3,B00KINIOVG,"Although the premise is pretty good the movie falls short in my opinion because of the very slow pace and somewhat flat acting. It's hard to believe the guy would follow someone around without knowing why. Could anybody really be that smitten and not know what he was getting himself into? However I am a fan of film noir and this has that flare for sure, I'll give it that.",1477440000,,374,4.357142857142857
6432130,2,B00KINIOVG,"I couldn't get up enough emotion to actually hate it.  Pretentious and overwritten - it wandered, never really crossing the barrier into film noir or developing a plot that would make it entertainment.  The actors seemed uncomfortable in their characters and with the mono and dialog.  The cinematography was first rate.  The rest seemed like a college project.  Wonder how it got funded? Daddy?

Maybe next time . . . .",1477440000,,420,4.845070422535211

6432190,2,B00KINIOVG,"I wanted to like this film more. It has a serene quality despite its urban setting and it does have some good points. But there are definitely more things that make you realize it had a low budget, such as the lead actress not being able to act, along with a few others. I understand what it was trying to achieve, trying to pull us into a mystery by letting us know up front, via the police-interview device, that something bad was going to happen. But you never are quite convinced of any of the character's motivations so a little twist at the end becomes a big ""who cares"".

It also doesn't help that on the surface, this film tries to be about love or storytelling, but at its heart, it is about lying. No one wants to be the gullible fool, nor will find it easy to relate to a main character whom we see duped not once, not twice, but three times.",1477180800,,853,4.201219512195122

You be the judge, but if you can stand the wordiness, it is not a bad ride.

6432496,4,B00KINIOVG,"Works hard, a little pretentious, but mostly delivers.

This movie has the classic noire elements of The Man Who Gets Involved with The Wrong Kind of Girl only to be Sucked Into an Amoral Reality. In this case, Henry Ian Cusick is a documentary film-maker. For no apparent reason, he becomes smitten with Lexi, a girl he meets on a train. They share clever banter.  She gives him a fake number and gets off at the next stop. Then, although he's been looking for her, she finds him and asks him to follow a man around - who she doesn't say is her husband, but doesn't say is not her husband - for no explicit reason.  Because he's smitten, he does, and from there the bad decisions pile up until there are bodies and the police is looking at him as either the victim or the suspect.

The story is engaging, particularly compared to so much of the dreck that's out there.  The writing gets a bit pretentious and stilted when it waxes lyrical.  Because Cusick is a film-maker, we have metaphors up the whazoo.

Along with another reviewer, I wonder about the Catholic element.  Everyone seems to be Catholic and sporting a connection to St. Jude.  Obviously, someone with more film criticism experience can unpack the metaphors there.

The conclusion does deliver a bit of a minor film noire twist.

If you are a fan of flim noire, this is minor noire, but you will enjoy it.

If you are looking for explosions and gunfights, just walk on by.",1415491200,43,1439,4.492307692307692

6432500,4,B00KINIOVG,"This is a movie about the power of fiction to tell the truth, and about the worth of holding out for idealism against cynicism. These themes are bound into an engaging psychological thriller, and the title is a riff on the classic Strangers on a Train (1951). I would compare it in some ways to After Hours (1985), another great American noir movie about a nice guy who gets in over his head, and both The Girl on the Train and After Hours play some with ""dream versus reality"". I have not seen any reviews that mention how important Catholicism is to the atmosphere of the movie --despite the prominence of saints' medals, little crosses, and one scary nail. It isn't a perfect movie: the dialogue sometimes hits a flat note when it's trying to sing, and some of the ""movie about a guy who makes movies"" stuff is a little trite. But the visual accomplishment is high, and the characters are people you want to watch for all of the rather brief 80 minutes that they share your imagination. Well worth seeing. (And for those of you in California: don't be scared off by the brain-dead review that ran in the LA Times.)",1408838400,23,1117,4.480392156862745
