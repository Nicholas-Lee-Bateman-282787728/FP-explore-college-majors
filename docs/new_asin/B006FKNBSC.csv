4984965,5,B006FKNBSC,"I happened to find Bobby's World on On Demand one night while searching for something new for my 4-year old son to watch. I loved this cartoon as a kid (I'm 25) and thought he would enjoy it too. I was completely correct. Needless to say, all the free episodes available to us went by fast, so I ordered this DVD collection for him as a Christmas gift. He loves it, and we've almost watched all of the episodes.",1359331200,,411,4.215189873417722
4984966,5,B006FKNBSC,"I was so glad to see one of my favorite shows on DVD and so cheap, it arrived at my house in real good time.",1355356800,,108,3.36
4984967,5,B006FKNBSC,"I loved Bobby's World when it used to come on TV years ago. My young son reminds me a lot of Bobby with his inquisitive mind. You can actually see my son's wheels churning as you speak with him about everyday things. I thought that getting the CD would be nice for him. I was right, he loves them.",1355270400,,297,4.0508474576271185
4984968,5,B006FKNBSC,"I love this cartoon because it's funny for both children and adults. There are references to things that only adults would understand (not bad things...just puns and things like that), which makes it enjoyable for adults, too. I actually bought the episode for me - not my daughter - because I remember watching it when I was younger and really liking it. I haven't shown it to my daughter, yet, but I'm sure she'll probably like it, too. I would recommend this product to anyone with younger kids (around 4 to 8), but I also recommend watching it with them because it's pretty funny.",1351641600,,584,4.625
4984969,4,B006FKNBSC,"Bobby's World debuted in 1990, as part of the FOX Kids lineup. It is also the longest running (in reference to how long it lasted, not how many episodes it had) FOX Kids show on the network, lasting 8 seasons and 81 episodes in total; although the DVDs being sold on Amazon has 7 seasons total...don't be alarmed, all 81 episodes are still presented. The show is about the very imaginative adventures of Bobby Generic (pronounced JEN-a-rick, not jin-AIR-ick...a running joke on the show). It was created by Howie Mandel (Deal or No Deal; current judge on America's Got Talent).

How does the show hold up in today's world? Surprisingly well. Don't expect miracles from a soon-to-be 22 year old show, but it serves its purpose well, and its purpose is to entertain. I grew up with this show, being 3 when it debuted, and I watched it until it ended in 1998 (I was 11 in 1998). I still had a lot of fun watching it at 24. I have a younger brother and sister who would also enjoy the show, so there are a lot of benefits to be gained with a show like Bobby's World.

Video Quality: 2.5/5

The episodes are presented in their original aspect ratio of 1.33:1. That's one good thing, at least. The quality, though, is a mess. Very noticeable scan lines on some scenes, dirt, debris...the works. I wasn't expecting miracles for a show from 1990, but I've also seen VHS that looked better than this. All is not a total loss, though. Episodes, for the most part, are very much watchable, and some scenes do look just fine.

Audio Quality: 3/5

The episodes are presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, at 192 kbps. The audio quality is just fine, for the most part. It's very standard stereo quality that you'd expect from a 90's cartoon. Nothing more, nothing less. Probably my only complaint is how bad the end credits music sounds, quality-wise. It sounds very poorly mixed. Not sure if it was like that originally.

The Episodes:

Here's what's included in the Season 1 DVD set, along with runtimes:

1. The Visit To Aunt Ruth's (21:28)
2. Uncle Ted's Excellent Adventure (22:21)
3. Adventures in Bobby Sitting (22:07)
4. My Dad Can Fix Anything (21:23)
5. The Best One Of The Mall (21:26)
6. Me And Roger (21:26)
7. The Big Sweep (21:34)
8. The Night Of The Living Pumpkin (21:28)
9. Beach Blanket Bobby (21:31)
10. The Revenge Of Dr. Noo (22:09)
11. See America Last (21:26)
12. Bobby's Big Broadcast (22:11)
13. In Search Of The Ring Bear (21:31)

One of the big problems of this DVD set is that the episodes are PAL-sourced, which means there's a 4% speed up. This, however, does not affect the 2nd episode, Uncle Ted's Excellent Adventure, presented in proper speed (but has some bad framerate problems of its own, which leads me to believe it was also PAL-sourced, but without the speed issue). There are no cuts that I noticed, at least, so episodes are in their original (but slightly faster) form. For closing logo fanatics, there are closing logos for ""Film Roman"" and ""Saban International"" (a European production company...more proof that these are PAL-sourced). Uncle Ted's Excellent Adventure also has a closing logo for Fox Children's Productions.

Wrap-Up and Recommendation:

As you noticed, despite the average scores I gave for picture and sound quality, and also the mention of PAL-sourced episodes, I still gave the DVD set 4 stars. Simply put...it's Bobby's World on DVD. 4 stars means I like it, and...well...I like the show. So that's what gets the 4 stars. We've waited a long time for it to arrive, and it finally has. For fans of the show, the DVD comes recommended, but proceed with caution. For the record, this DVD set loaded up just fine on my HTPC, and I might just continue watching the series on that, via VLC Player (watching in 0.96 speed, to give the proper speed for the episodes). For those who may be put off with issues mentioned here, this may not be the DVD for you. Since it is an MOD release (Manufactured On Demand), you can't really go out and rent it to judge for yourself. The show is a fun one, and it still holds up pretty well, even with the rather dated look of the clothing and styles of the time...if anything, it serves as a fun look of the early 90's, preserved on DVD. Hope you enjoyed this review...",1332201600,9,4250,4.578947368421052

4984982,4,B006FKNBSC,"I was born in 1982 and grew up watching this show.  I loved it, and still do.  My son is 6 and I wanted him to see this show because I figured he would like it.  It is a big hit in our house now.  The humor in this show is great, Bobby's imagination is awesome, and I love how there is some adult humor subtly incorporated into this.  Do know this though...the picture quality isn't great, and if you have a larger TV you will have to deal with the large black bars on the side.  Changing the viewing mode just skews the picture more unfortunately.  This is unavoidable since the show is old and wasn't high quality back in the day either.  It's still watchable, and the quality isn't too bothersome, but just be prepared for not the greatest picture.  Overall I am still happy I bought this though!",1469491200,2,799,4.23841059602649

4985104,2,B006FKNBSC,"I let my 8 year old watch this show one time alone.  The next time I watched it with him and I was not impressed.  Quite honestly I found it similiar to Sponge Bob- inappropriate language, use of pretend guns, etc.  Quite honestly Howie Mandell, I was SUPER unimpressed.  Will some parents of 8 year olds find this ok?  Of course!  I however, did not.  Such an innocent title gives you the wrong impression. Lesson learned.",1373500800,2,423,4.4868421052631575
4985105,5,B006FKNBSC,"There is nothing bad at all to say about Bobby's World. My sister and I used to watch the show ALL the time on TV when we were kids. It was by far a favorite and we were very bummed when they took it off air.

There is one episode we both will always remember, and we frequently would joke about it bringing up old memories. I happened to stumble upon this DVD set of season 1 while I was shopping on here to find my sister a birthday gift. I knew this was PERFECT and would hit home!

She was beyond excited to receive this as a gift. And it doesn't matter how old you are- when you can pop in a DVD of one of your favorite childhood shows and watch them again, over and over, today or any other day- the memories never fade and it has brought nothing but smiles and a lot more laughs watching a classic show we used to together years ago.

This is still a great children's show. I recommend purchasing this set for anyone who used to watch the show when they were younger and remembers how fun it was. And for anyone younger, though this show was before their time, it is still a great cartoon for kids and one they can love & appreciate.

Great DVD set, makes for a good gift and so much fun for a trip down memory lane with lots of laughs. :)",1372809600,2,1246,4.012096774193548

of their life. The brother and sister don't think to have love for family members. And Bobby is a! ways wanting to learn new things and his family
doesn't have time to teach him . And show partrays Bobby doing his own thing and in his own world. Ant spending time with his family at all.
Bobby also looks like a three year old not five. And there's no respect for Bobby at all. That's my review of the show.",1481587200,,553,4.08256880733945
