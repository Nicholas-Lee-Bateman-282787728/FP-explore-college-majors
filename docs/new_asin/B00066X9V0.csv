2170025,5,B00066X9V0,This video is well-done and features all of the New York favorite Christmas sights along with some new ones I'll check out the next time I hit to the city.  It truly gets you in the spirit of Christmas and you avoid the crowds.,1196467200,3,227,4.159090909090909
2170026,4,B00066X9V0,Pictures are a little jumpy in places - but it is full of memories for me. Nice music and video. Played it twice already - in the middle of summer - while preparing dinner.,1183420800,2,172,4.088235294117647
2170027,1,B00066X9V0,"Christmas in New York has some good points, how could a DVD about such a wonderful city not have any!

The good points are:

1.  Beautiful scenery

2.  Beautiful Christmas lights

3.  Nice Christmas music in the background.

4.  Not bad, if you have it in the background for the music and look up at it occasionally, perhaps while opening presents.

The bad points are:

1.  There is no spoken words only a musical background

2.  Not a tour of New York City at Christmas

3.  Extremely repetitive

4.  I watched a good part of this in the fast forward mode

5.  Although the scenery is lovely, Christmas in New York is always beautiful, it gets extremely boring.",1168819200,6,663,4.4576271186440675
2170028,5,B00066X9V0,"Great, just great. Being from NY, it helped me to feel like I was at home again. But just love all the Christmas lights. Kids and adults will love this DVD>",1167782400,2,156,4.064516129032258
2170029,5,B00066X9V0,"Awesome! I wasn't expecting live video, I just thought it would be a slideshow to music. Boy was I wrong! I have it playing on my 55 inch plasma and feel like I am back home. My 3 year old especially loves the part showing the citicorp train set up, it was awesome to watch! I also loved the neighborhoods showing snow and lights and decorations, made me feel like I was looking back at my old street, just gave me that magical feeling like you only have as a child. :)

Of coarse I didn't live in the city, we lived on the island, but we would go to the city at Christmas when I was little to see the Nutcracker, and Rockefeller Plaza, and window shop. just to see the snow, the decorations the trees, the people, just brought back such warm memories for me, as I am homesick for snow here in the south. I am planning to play it all night for my Christmas Eve company, and than bring it with me to my sisters for Christmas Day, of coarse I am sure the guys will turn it off to watch football. lol... Anyway I didn't get it here at amazon, cause I found it at CD universe for $6.99. What a bargin! Highly recommended!!!!!!

PS: The only thing I would have liked to see done differently, but is ok as is.. would be some actual classic Christmas music, performed by original artists, but I guess that gets into copyright issues. Anyway my work around when I get tired of the music on disk (which is nice and very relaxing btw) is to dub my direct-tv XM holly channel 107 through the receiver, so I see the video of the dvd but the audio of the Christmas channel which has all the classics... awesome!!!! I am ready for Santa now :) lol....",1166832000,10,1637,4.177215189873418
2170030,5,B00066X9V0,"This dvd is wonderful.  Scenes all over New York City. You can almost feel the cold and see your breath as you experience wonderful holiday scenes from the famous Angels to Central Park, which is a dazzler!

The music is perfect and seems to be coreographed to fit the scenes at times. There is amazing footage of a miniature New York City (historical)

set up in a beautful atrium with a great train running through , a babbling brook , green grass , trees and shrubs. Macy's windows, carriage rides, lights, trees , fountains, wind, snow ... in short all the things that make Christmas and winter the wonderful season that it is.  Buy it, and you may be back to purchase some as gifts!!",1164585600,6,688,4.48
2170031,5,B00066X9V0,A MUST for anyone that comes from NY or NJ or remembers a visit to NYC at Christmas time,1163116800,12,88,3.6842105263157894
2170032,5,B00066X9V0,"Although I haven't seen most of the scenes in this video, somehow it gives me a feeling of nostalgia for NYC at Xmas time. Last Xmas my whole family wound up sitting and watching it when we shoulda been preparing Xmas dinner.  It is beautifully photographed and much of it has great snow scenes in Central Park as well as more familiar landmarks like Rock Center and so on.  Great value.",1154908800,15,387,4.436619718309859
2170033,5,B00066X9V0,"I just bought a 42"" plasma screen and was looking for some 'wallpaper' video I could play on it when not watching TV or entertaining.  I have a video of the Yule Log buring in a fireplace and was looking for something along that line.

This DVD is that, but it delivers much, much more.  It's an hour and a half of great images that never repeat.  The shots are edited to flow with the music and they've managed to put about 20 or so great xmas selections that seem drawn from many different sources, from full orchestras to choral to simple woodwinds.  I'm going to order a few more as gifts because I have some friends, who when they see this, will want to have their own copies.",1130803200,56,681,4.248062015503876
2170034,5,B00066X9V0,I got one of these last Christmas and just ordered five to give as gifts this Christmas.  Anyone who's visited New York at Christmas time will want to have this and anyone who's never visited New York at Christmas time SHOULD have this!,1123113600,29,236,4.488372093023256

2170036,4,B00066X9V0,"It's in the 80's here today so I'm not about to get all excited about watching a Christmas video just yet. From  what I've seen it's a good enough production and has some interesting scenes. A  little too commercial but other than that not bad. I grew up in and around NYC but haven't been back in 52 years so a lot has changed and a lot has remained. NYC is a wonderful place and I have fond memories as a child there as well as a young adult. It's very hard to go back to a city or town and see it as you did years ago. I guess I was looking more for a time than a place.
I would recommend this to anyone who loves NYC around the winter holidays no matter what age you are. There is enough variety in this video to satisfy most people.",1444348800,2,737,3.9066666666666667

2170044,5,B00066X9V0,"Nice clips of scenes with snow/without snow of city/residential, and inside and outside stores and hotels. Showed everything I remember Christmas that I don't find here anymore. Love the old looking tree ornaments--wish I could find some like those. The Christmas music were wonderfully arranged so I did not have to silence the tape and put on one of my Christmas discs! :)",1408752000,3,374,4.9523809523809526
2170045,5,B00066X9V0,"This is the second time I have purchased this DVD so you can tell it is a favorite. The first one was watched so frequently, and were it not for a mishap which killed it being viewable, it would continue to be watched. I had to get this again and was so glad to see it was still available. Would highly recommend it for Christmas viewing or as a background to your celebration.",1408579200,3,377,4.178082191780822

2170047,4,B00066X9V0,"Very well done.  I like nostalgia.  There are too many restrictions now because of ""the war against Christmas"".  Ir's nice to see Christmas being celebrated without so many damn restrictions.",1395878400,,191,5.3

2170052,4,B00066X9V0,"I cant make it to New York this Christmas and so this is a nice inexpensive way to feel the New York Christmas Experience.
Maybe some of the music is a bit lame and I'm not into all the model trains but overall the pictures of Rockefeller Center and Central Park in the snow are Great.",1385942400,,285,4.107142857142857
2170053,5,B00066X9V0,"This is such wonderful Christmas music set in New York City and the music is perfect to match the scenery of ice skating, shopping, and decorations that abound.  Highly recommended.",1383264000,,181,5.033333333333333
2170054,5,B00066X9V0,"If you like watching Christmas lights, you'll enjoy this movie.  Richmond doesn't have a large number of people who are willing to trouble themselves with putting up lights, and I love looking at Christmas lights.",1382745600,,213,5.085714285714285

2170056,5,B00066X9V0,"A trip down memory lane for me to so many places I saw as I grew up in New York City, musical accompaniment is just right, not too loud just great music of the season. Even for those who haven't grown up in NYC it is still a beautiful viewing of what makes the city magical during the Christmas season.",1362960000,,302,4.05

2170064,5,B00066X9V0,"I'm not from New York, but another eastern big city.  Moved away decades ago, and miss those big city light displays and the big city department store window displays - this dvd filled that nostalgia craving perfectly. Loved the refined Chrimastmas music that went with it. It looks beautiful on my flatscreen (of more ordinary size.) What wonderful little gift treat for yourself or anyone else.",1352764800,,396,5.0
2170065,1,B00066X9V0,"The positive reviews on this product are outright lies.  The footage is grainy, outdated, and mostly boring.  Most was shot in dreary grey weather.  With so many wonderful things to capture in NYC, they must have gone out of their way to get so many shots of bundled up people trudging along grey slushy streets.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this!",1336176000,4,353,4.555555555555555
2170066,4,B00066X9V0,"I purchased this dvd during the Christmas season, while surfing amazon.com Movies and Music, and i came across this dvd, it is very chritmas like and it is a very good gift for tourits vising New York as well as NY residents who remember the old New York Christmas such as myself.

2170067,1,B00066X9V0,"boring DVD of a ghost town, without people, decorated with millions of light bulbs, accompanied with depressive music. Too much of scene repetition. I 've never been in NY on Christmas and after this DVD I am not intending to. Do not buy it!",1328400000,2,241,4.5
2170068,5,B00066X9V0,"My mother relocated to Florida many years ago but still remembers the way New York celebrates Christmas.  I sent her this DVD so that she could see the City's decorations.  While some have changed over the years, many remain as she remembered them.  From Rockafeller Center to the Lord and Tailor window to the Bronx (now New York) Botanical Gardens, the array of decorations is impressive. Adding to the wonderful pictures is a wide range of Christmas Music.  This DVD should be in the collection of anyone who enjoys the Christmas Holiday.",1325808000,,541,4.8478260869565215
2170069,5,B00066X9V0,"This is a nice video Of NYC at Christmas, as a native New Yorker this video had Many sites I have never seen, all and all a nice video",1325116800,,134,3.6551724137931036
2170070,5,B00066X9V0,"We've spent Christmas in NYC for the past few years, but sadly this year can't make it.  I just received this video the other day & I love it.  The way it's filmed isn't overly professional (but not overly armature either).  It has the feel of of being filmed by someone that's just REALLY good with a camera. It makes you feel like you're THERE & not just watching a video from the Visitor & Convention Bureau.  You view the many sights from a first-person angle which adds to the ""like being there"" feeling.

There really is nothing like Christmas in New York--its FANTASTIC!  If you've never been & wondered what it's like, this is the PERFECT DVD for you.  Also a nice gift for the homesick NY-er in your life.  Again, if you want a video that REALLY makes you FEEL like you're in the city, then stop reading reviews & order this NOW!!!

Oh, one quick side note - this video is not a guide to the city; you won't learn where to go & how to get there. This is a ""visual only"" DVD, so don't get it thinking you'll learn your way around the city in preparation for a trip.",1323820800,4,1073,4.220588235294118
2170071,3,B00066X9V0,"The DVD is ok.  Good background music.  I was under the impression these images would be ""still"" images on a slide show, but it is video of the images.  I thought it repeated alot of the same shots.  Plus, there are tons of people in the video.  At some points, all you see are people crowding through doorways, completely unrelated to Christmas images.  I'll still use it as a background for holiday parties, since people aren't going to really be ""watching"" the TV.",1323129600,2,467,4.566265060240964
2170072,1,B00066X9V0,"I regretfully must say I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews regarding this Christmas in NY DVD, before I purchased it.  If you are looking for a professional looking DVD, with exceptional clarity and scenery, this is not the video to purchase.  Regardless of it being filmed in New York, the quality of this DVD is awful.  As others stated, the camera is shakey and the same scenes were repeated numerous times. I could only watch 10 minutes of it before I notified Amazon that I was going to return it. The images were grainey, dark and dismal with many shots of people walking by and in front of the camera.  To uphold Amazon's good name, they should remove it from being sold on their website.  Now I know why there was no sample clip to see prior to purchasing.",1322784000,5,786,4.468531468531468
2170073,1,B00066X9V0,"Being from New York and living in Reno, Nevada the past 12 years, I was truly looking forward to viewing this DVD.  First THE MUSIC is not in the order, as stated on the back of the jacket cover.  Worse:  THE SIGHTS are NOT listed in the order they are on the Jacket.  The DVD is extremely repetious.  The most disappointing factor were The Department Store Windows.  Macys was done very well.  Saks was intermittant.  But  Lord & Taylors was just about omitted.  Also while trying to look at the windows there were traffic and people in front of the windows.  This clearly was not shot professionally.  There aren't words to express my disappointment how they filmed Lord & Taylors, or basically didn't film it. When you advertise department store windows, you expect to see the windows, all of them and not with traffic or other obstructions.  Yet I kept seeing Central Park over and over again.  Rockefeller Tree over and over and Radio City Music Hall with the toy Soldiers being blown down again and again.  I do believe I saw the inside of the Marriot Hotel, but no mention of it on the DVD.  You will be 100% disappointed if you purchase this DVD. I ordered it directly from Amazon.",1322438400,7,1189,4.537735849056604
2170074,2,B00066X9V0,"This DVD was a disappointment!!  I thought it was going to be about New York...throughout the state...homes, etc. Footage amateurish...not enjoyable to watch...music okay however...

Would not purchase this again...",1322006400,3,215,6.133333333333334
2170075,5,B00066X9V0,"Along with another purchase of a similar DVD, this one just joined our collection for my extreme lighting husband.  This is really beautiful to look at, music is great too.

2170076,5,B00066X9V0,"Well worth the money.  Transports the viewer into a wonderland of Christmas.  From the opening with the metallic flags at Rockefeller Center to the Central Park skaters to the miniature trains at, I believe, the Botanical Gardens the DVD can be enjoyed by all ages.  Every scene has a Christmas musical background and if you want something to put you in the Christmas mood, buy it.  I would have liked more ""people in the street"" scenes and a little less of the Stock Exchange, but the DVD is fine as it is. If you are looking for Radio City interior, look elsewhere -- however, you will see the Radio City sign and the wooden soldiers on the marquee.",1289260800,,651,4.491525423728813

2170080,2,B00066X9V0,"I am seriously baffled that this DVD was reviewed as highly as it is. I think it's just plan awful. My theory behind the high ratings is that it brings joy to former New Yorkers in it's nostalgia for their favorite Christmas haunts. Unfortunately, I found the camera work to be just plain awful. I played it on my bigscreen and actually got slightly motion sick in places, as the camera swayed and shook. The editing was terrible and many of the shots were questionnable. Indeed, I can see that the sights in New York are breathtaking, but I believe a more adept camera person would have caught them better.",1253750400,2,607,4.527272727272727

I have just booked the Greyline tour bus, which lasts for 48hrs and includes 2 evening tours of the Christmas lights of Manhattan. For anyone who is planning a trip to Manhattan on or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, this dvd is a must.

Even though I live only 9 miles from NYC, I wanted to be able to capture the excitement of it all during the rest of the year! Just to think I could be sitting in my home on a hot sweltering day in July and anticipating the holiday season was reason enough for me to buy this DVD. It's all encompassing and fabulously done!",1231286400,2,422,3.9647058823529413
2170089,3,B00066X9V0,"this dvd is just xmas music only and visits around new york, it shows some nice houses with the decorations and all lights on, it can be  boring at times for the length of it. and there is some repeats of the same scenes over and over again. the scenes of the city new york are very good and color is good, but again it is only a once a year to watch.  the tunes are of xmas only  for me Id rather have the likes of Max Steiner Or Erich Wolfgang Korngold with his film music all the way through. but for anyone who likes this type of music then it is good to buy. I prefer a narration to anything like this  type of movie, sombody like Morgan Freeman to tell you of the story  anyway its your choice  and after you watch it then its back on the shelf till next time around.",1228348800,2,773,3.923076923076923

2170091,5,B00066X9V0,"I have never been to New York, and I love the Christmas season, therefore, this is a DVD for me.  When I received this DVD, I was not yet ready to watch it, but I installed it only to glance at the video to see the quality of what I had purchased.  I ended up watching the entire one and one-half hours of video.  It is mezmermizing.  It is peacefully done, and worth sharing with family. (I would prefer much less video, or none at all, of the enslaved horses pulling carriages though the city, though.)",1225584000,2,504,4.21875

The DVD is intended to be played as background while having a party, opening gifts, etc. I suggest playing and watching once and you will get a flavor of the variety that is New York at Christmas time.",1224547200,2,344,4.3076923076923075
2170093,3,B00066X9V0,"I lived in New York during 10 years (1964-1973) and enjoyed the Christmas
seasoon very much. I have visited New York several times but never at christmas.  Regarding the video, it is good in general, but found that many
scenes were held perhaps too long, so that when I show it to my friends
they loose interest. I am talking about the scenes with the trees and some
locations that are repeated.  But in general, I enjoyed it.

Thank you",1222128000,4,437,4.4375

I go to Manhattan every year and have never seen this much

The music is perfect too ...

2170095,2,B00066X9V0,"I have bought a few of this style of DVD, in the tradition of the video yule log, it's nice sometimes to have some Christmas sights and sounds droning on in the background while dealing with holiday tasks.

This one, sadly fell a little flat. The cinematography is a bit uninspiring, the music - well, I always mute the sound and listen to my own music with ambient videos, so I can't really weigh in on the soundtrack. The snippets I recall were like elevator music - pretty generic stuff.

I much preferred a video that's been playing on the HD channels the last few years, titled simply ""Christmas Lights"". This one features much better footage of Rockefeller Center, as well as the decorating of an Alaskan cabin, trimming a tree in coastal Maine, etc. I can't wait for this one to be available - I might be prompted to finally spring for an HD DVD player when it gets published. Maybe by next Christmas, the prices of the HD boxes will finally come down to earth!

But I'm rambling. Bottom line, Christmas in New York is just plain mediocre.",1200528000,7,1046,4.494736842105263

The music is great and the live images are beautiful (i expected slide images) It puts me in the mood for christmas and I get a snow fix as we rarely get any snow.",1199750400,2,245,3.641509433962264
2170097,2,B00066X9V0,"The good news:  There's really nothing quite like Christmas in New York: the snow, the lights, the shop windows, Rockefeller center, FAO Schwartz, the Bronx Zoo, etc.  All of these things are represented in this DVD.  As long as you're planning on playing as ""ambience,"" you might not be too disappointed, especially if you do not have a widescreen TV.

The bad news:  I took a chance on this video, as the product description did not include the aspect ratio.  I'll spoil the surprise for you: it is 4:3.  Aaaargh.  It looks quite bad (pixelation & ghosting) on my 40"" LCD TV, as does everything that's not shot in HD/widescreen.  The music is not good, but that's no problem; I'd planned to play the DVD on mute with my own Christmas A.M. playlist through the iPod/stereo for the Big Day.  Some not-so-interesting footage (holiday flags, lamp-post decorations, etc.) is worked into the loop far too often, and the editing is fast and choppy in places.  The camera was not held level for many of the scenes, so scenery with a horizon looks out of kilter.

I just wanted some snow as background for my 50 degree Christmas morning.  Darn you, global warming, darn you.  This DVD will have to do, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Happy  Whatever-You-Celebrate!",1197936000,5,1255,4.714285714285714

Since Westport is only about 42 miles from the city, my sister and I went with our parents several times in December and remember looking at the moving displays in certain store windows. There was a year we went to Radio City Music Hall to see the Rockettes and I am sure we at least watched the skaters outside. I have no memory of taking a carriage ride through Central Park but we did see the Bronx Zoo. So many sights to see and plenty of Christmas music to listen to. My only disappointment is it is all instrumental but the disc still brings all the sights and sounds of New York City to my living room.",1483660800,,735,4.257142857142857
