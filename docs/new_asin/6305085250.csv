7883779,5,6305085250,"There is absolutely NO QUESTION WHATSOEVER that this, Ringo's ""4th"" group of ""All-Starr's"" was the very best.  Certainly, the 2001 lineup was more ""eclectic,"" but this?  Are you ready:  Peter Frampton plays Guitar (and does the most leviticously deuteronomous version of ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" with Jack Bruce I've EVER heard, and - YES - I have ""Cream Goodbye/Reunited"" whatever, too...) - Jack Bruce plays Bass (see preceeding sentence), and makes Andy Fraser's bass part on ""All Right Now"" obsolete (not really, of course, but it's great to see him play that part) - (my favorite) Gary Brooker, Procol Harum on Keyboards.  Nothing else need be said, except, given the fact the ""Procol Harum"" is now but himself and four...scabs, this would have made an astronomical version of ""Procol Harum."" (Better watch w/ the ""adjectives"" there, I'm starting to sound as bad as Cameron Crowe, ain't I...) and Drummer Extraordinaire Simon Kirke, he who powered Free and Bad Company, makes ANY other drummer who may've appeared with Ringo as an ""All Star"" sound limp-wristed. And Ringo's Right Hand Man, Mark Rivera (ostensibly, the sax player, but he does everything from singing background, playing rhythm guitar and organ -and I've seen him play bass, too) makes sure that there are no holes in the music.  As Ringo himslf said, ""He's the one who knows what key the song is in!""  Well..that too, but I am drooling by the 'net, waiting for the day that ""Rockabella Productions"" will make THIS ""All-Starr"" outing available on DVD - but till it does: remember that this tape is mixed in excellent stereo, and remember that cutesy little commercial-thing that MTV used to do about ""hooking your TV up to your stereo."" 11/5/07 UPDATE:  Hey, ""Rockabella,"" WHY AIN'T THIS ALL STARR LINEUP AVAILBLE ON DVD YET???????????  Do you EVER listen to fans, or are you just going (Heaven HELP us!) to trot out ""Sheila E"" again?  Inquiring mindz want 2 kno! 9/3/10 update:  PAY WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO for a copy of this!  You can only hear Rock and Roll played better, with more authority just ONE place and ONE place only:  ""Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones!"" 3/23/13 update #2:  I'm not ashamed to admit it since ""Rockabella"" evidentally doesn't listen to fans:  I just bought a boot on DVD.  When you deign to listen to fans, I believe you might do more business.  Till then...9/13/13 - this is now available on DVD.  True, it's a boot, but since ""MPL"" or whoever refuses to listen to Ringo's fan pleas to release this on DVD (honestly folks - it's EASILY ""up there"" with Gimme Shelter, The Last Waltz, et al",1166227200,2,2593,4.804054054054054
7883780,5,6305085250,"This is by far one of thr greatest concerts I've ever seen. Period. For the reviewer below,Jack Bruce WAS the singer in CREAM!!Eric only sang a couple of tunes. Now if any of you ""record company clowns"" are reading,WHERE IS THE DVD?!!!Do you not want to make any money?",1115856000,6,269,4.510204081632653
7883781,5,6305085250,"This lineup of the ALL STARR BAND deserves DVD treatment right away! It is absolutely the best band Ringo took on tour...well, besides those other guys.",1110412800,2,152,4.884615384615385
7883782,5,6305085250,"This video is just wonderful from beginning to end!  Each member of this band is extremely talented, and compliments each other well.  The guitarwork of Peter Frampton is incredible, particularly when applied to the Cream masterpieces that the brilliant Jack Bruce sings.  I love Clapton's versions, but they pale quickly when one's hears them with Bruce handling the vocals, and Frampton's blazing Gibson!  I saw one of Ringo's earlier tours, so I was not surprised by his wonderful performance.  He is the greatest drummer in rock history, but he is also a wonderful ""frontman"", or host.  My only disappointment with the show was that Ringo did not do a selection from his excellent ""Vertical Man"" album.
  Gary Brooker adds such a wonderful change to the festivities with the lyrical depth of his gems that come to life with his magnificent voice.  Simon Kirke presented a few of the ""Free"" and ""Bad Company"" hits that Bruce and Frampton interpreted with the greatest of ease!
  It is sad to think that this band may never play together again!  But I am thankful for this show. I hope that Ringo considers releasing videos of his other tours as well, ..particularly the one with John Entwisle and Mark Farner!",1029110400,2,1212,4.8585365853658535
7883783,5,6305085250,"This video was recorded in May of 1998 at the Pine Knob Music Theatre near Detroit. I know...I was there for the show.
I went with a friend, she being a Peter Frampton nut and I being a Beatlemanic. Having seen the All-Starr Band before (the first tour), and not being all that impressed, my hopes weren't to high for this show.
I couldn't have been more suprised or delighted.
The usual huge band was stripped down to Ringo, Frampton, Cream's Jack Bruce on bass, Simon Kirke (free/Bad Company) also on drums, Gary Brooker of Procul Harum fame on keyboards, and Mark Rivera (noted side man who's played everything with everybody).
Now with this kind of a line-up, you could imagine that there'd be big clash of the egos, but not so. This was a BAND in the biggest sense; the chemestry was amazing, everyone on stage was clearly having a great time and threw themselves into the performance, whether they were the soloist or not.
Most notable were Brooker's solo performance of ""A Salty Dog"" and a great version of ""Conquistador""; Frampton's accoustic rendering of ""Norwegan Wood"" and the jam of ""Do You Feel Like We Do"" with stunning solos from Brooker, Bruce and Frampton; Kurke's rousing delivery of ""Shooting Star"" and Bruce's turns on ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""White Room"" with Frampton out-Clapton-ing Clapton. Ringo, of course, was drumming away in the back, smiling all the time, and clearly having fun with his solo turns.
Although this was Ringo's show, and all gave great performances, the real star here was Frampton. His guitar work was uniformily excellent throughout the concert. The ironic part is that he truly shone while backing everyone else up.
This spirited and often stunning performance was fortunately captured here on video. The show was as we saw it at Pine Knob; no edits or alterations. It's shot and edited a bit roughly at points, but the magic and fun of the performance was captured rather well. That's all that counts.
An excellent concert caught on tape...highly recommended. You'll walk away from this as we did from Pine Knob; suprised and delighted.",1018569600,4,2089,4.837988826815643
