The older one is just starting to pick up on the informative details in each song (13,000 pounds!  13,000 pounds) and the little one just adores the catchy tunes and great animal shots.  I would never have imagined an aardvark to be one of their favorite animals!

Similar to the Laurie Berkner video, it is one of few that will hold their attention for more than 5-10 minutes.",1109548800,,430,4.271604938271605
7836341,5,6302987024,"This is an amazing video that both my children (2 and 4) adore.  The songs are not just catchy, but they are informative.  My son told his grandmother HOW a polar bear stays warm, how much an elephant usually weighs, and that Meerkats live in families and one keeps a lookout while the others eat.  My 2 year old daughter is always asking to watch ""Zoo, zoo, zoo!""  She has her stuffed animals act out what the animals do on the video! This was one of the best video purchases we have made...so we bought At the Zoo 2.  Also fantastic!",1013904000,3,535,4.257425742574258
