4082589,3,B0037X5BFQ,"There doesn't seem to be a clear/cogent thought line that ties this together.
I love the cinematography, but it just sort of erratically bounces around to different places.
It makes it hard to want to just sit and watch it, but watching it in small snippets, or as you're doing something else (laundry, computer work, etc...) is very enjoyable.",1387324800,4,344,4.8474576271186445
4082590,5,B0037X5BFQ,"The first program is Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Why were the falls named for a British queen? That should be changed. The falls span the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The second program is Drakensberg: Barrier of Spears. Let's not name this area for a Brit. Is there some famous leader in South Africa whose name could be used to rename the Drakensberg Mountains? Who would you suggest?",1372464000,2,428,4.72
4082591,5,B0037X5BFQ,"Program One:  Victoria Falls

The program starts out by highlighting the Zambezi River. It follows how the local residents and animals, have only a short window of opportunity to fish, and engage in recreational activity, and only when the level of the powerful river winds down. Before that it's too powerful for even fish to swim in. The waterfall is the largest in the world, and the rushing water is dangerous to everything. From there it covers the animals that depend on the river for survival.

A misprint on the back of the jacket cover has Victoria Falls as program number 2, but when you insert the disc, Victoria Falls is really program number 1. Other than that the program is interesting, the music is pleasant, and the visuals are very clear.

Program Two: Drakenberg Barrier of Spears

This program is about the Dragon Mountains, that is what they call these mountains because they are shaped like the spines of a dragon. The mountains span for 600 miles across southern Africa. From there the documentary covers the everyday survival strategies of the local animals and its inhabitants. This program on the disc is also very interesting, and has some wonderful visuals.",1364083200,12,1185,4.875621890547263

8390876,1,B0037X5BFQ,"I am sorry to say that the two places in this video are not really that amazing. The mountains have an ugly brown color, not at all like the beautiful granite in Yosemite.  Victoria falls is basically a hole in the ground that the Zambezi River falls into to produce Victoria Falls. The river itself before and after the falls is not that attractive, nor is the surrounding country side. A better title would be Two Weird Places in Africa.",1468195200,,439,4.4875
8390877,5,B0037X5BFQ,Another top documentary from Nature. And value for money with the Bluray and DVD.,1468108800,,81,4.857142857142857
