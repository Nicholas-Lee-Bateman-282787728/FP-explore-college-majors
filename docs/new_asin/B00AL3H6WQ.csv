8553264,1,B00AL3H6WQ,I agree with the other reviewer.  I had it on for 5 minutes and looked at my watch.  The New Age music is cornfully awful,1504828800,,121,3.8
8553265,1,B00AL3H6WQ,"Wow.  Just wow.

These videos are terrible.  I mean, not just bad, but really really bad.  The scenes are mostly boring, the camera moves uninteresting, and the 3D alignment is so bad it should never have been published.  I mean, you can't shoot quality 3D video when the two cameras are pointing different directions!  The cameras were so poorly aligned, it's almost as if they were on completely different tripods.  They didn't even try to clean it up in post-production, so it's very painful to watch.  This is not professionally produced work, and gives 3D a bad name.

I don't know why Amazon recommended this videos with my Samsung 3D TV.  I would never buy these or recommend them to anybody.",1462233600,2,699,4.702479338842975
