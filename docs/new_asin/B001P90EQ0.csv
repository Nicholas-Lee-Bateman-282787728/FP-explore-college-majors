3743724,5,B001P90EQ0,"Originally from Los Angeles, I first purchased the book of photographs almost 10 years ago while living in New York.
Don Normark's images are really wonderful - historical, documentary, and beautiful all at the same time.  It's also an incredible story, one many Angelenos don't know.
While there are so many famous images of New York, taken throughout it's history, there are fewer well-know photographs of L.A. from the early to mid-20th Century.
The documentary film, while fairly brief, is filled with a great deal of information.
The interviews of former Chavez Ravine residents, along with Normark's images takes the story to another level.",1255564800,,646,5.211538461538462
3743725,5,B001P90EQ0,"I bought this book solely on it's photographic merits. As a photographer, I was interested in the real life recording of a time period in our history. Although I live in Texas and the book is based on events that happened in California, the book brought back many memories of my own childhood.
The story reveals the true events that led to the demolishment of neighborhoods and the forceful displacements of many poor families just for the benefit ($$$) of a few greedy politicians.
I also recommend the DVD which adds additional empathy for the poor residents who were victimized by the greedy politicians of the era. The residents were given no recourse or support in this quest of 'eminent domain' in the name of 'progress'.
This documentary is not just a story of or for Spanish speakers. It affected not only residents of Spanish ancestry, but also Anglos and African Americans as well.
I highly recommend this book as well as the DVD. For those who understand Spanish, I also recommend the music CD. I bought several of each to give to family members.",1252713600,,1057,4.718918918918919
3743726,5,B001P90EQ0,"This is a great short film. Amazing footage, and great use of the photography of Don Normark to tell the story of Chavez Ravine. Its important to know and understand the stories of displacement and gentrification that continue to take place at the expense of underrepresented communities.",1239840000,,288,5.148936170212766

8332557,5,B001P90EQ0,This is a great short documentary on the history of Chavez Ravine.  Very well done and much cheaper to buy through Amazon as opposed to the company that produced it.,1489190400,,165,4.5
8332558,5,B001P90EQ0,"Purchased  DVD to go along with the book, after having seen Culture Clash performance of Chavez Ravine @ Kirk Douglas Theatre. Very happy with both products",1423872000,,156,5.0
8332559,5,B001P90EQ0,"Poignant interviews, well-written and delivered narration, and great music back the unforgettable photographs of Don Normark to tell the human story of one Los Angeles neighborhood destroyed in the name of progress. A 30 minute documentary you will watch and want to share.",1417910400,,273,5.372093023255814
8332560,5,B001P90EQ0,"This film is the perfect ethical litmus test.  If you can watch the clueless representative from the Dodgers give out olive branches to Latino ancestors of original Chavez Ravine residents who were displaced from their homes, then you are a Bad Person. If watching the scene makes your guts turn inside out and you want to die for the humiliation you feel--which said clueless man clearly does not in the least--then you are a Good Person.

It's a simple as that, because this bit of history is as straightforward as that. Good people bought homes. Bad people with more money wanted to take their homes away. Good people were lied to by rich bad people. Rich bad people bought politicians. Good people lost. End of story.

And no... I'm not saying that being rich makes you a bad person. I'm not saying that--and I don't believe it. But the bad people in this story were all rich, and the rich people in this story were all bad. Q. E. D.

A great film and a great price; I just wish it was longer than 23 minutes.",1391817600,,1013,4.43010752688172
8332561,5,B001P90EQ0,"See my review of the book, I highly recommend both. The two enhance each other and will make your experience better.",1378080000,,116,4.571428571428571
8332562,3,B001P90EQ0,"Anyone who has the book Chavez Ravine, which shows the idyllic villages of La Loma, Bishop, and Palo Verde before they were ripped out to build Dodger Stadium, will appreciate that this film was made at all, and enjoy the brief interview snippets with some of ""Los Desterrados.""  But it's almost an insult that the film is so excruciatingly short . . .should've been an hour mimimum . . . Ken Burns could've done a whole series on the topic. Sadly, this is all we've got in the way of films on this subject.  The film is well-made, and the only reason it got a lousy 3 stars from me is due to the length. You gotta have it, though, just to view those Don Normark photos on your TV screen.",1372896000,,688,4.244274809160306
8332563,5,B001P90EQ0,"I think this really puts into perspective the injustice done to the neighborhood of Chavez Ravine in the name of progress.  Sad history and as far as I am concerned only one of a long list of injustices done to the Mexican/American, Chicano/a people.",1355875200,,250,4.681818181818182
8332564,5,B001P90EQ0,"Great documentary.  Growing up in the greater Los Angeles area, I've been a Dodgers fan since I was a little kid.  But after watching this documentary and buying the companion book, I now see things in a different light.  It's a damn shame what happened to the people of Chavez Ravine.  Was the Dodgers organization to blame?  Buy this documentary and decide for yourself.  You'll see and hear from the people who were actually residents of Chavez Ravine.",1343260800,,455,4.769230769230769
8332565,5,B001P90EQ0,"Growing up in Los Angeles I always knew the story of Chavez Ravine, I knew that the home owners were displaced for the Dodgers and that was the ""general story"".  I never heard the story about what happened to Mr. Wilkerson of the Housing Authority and and that land had first been dedicated for low cost housing.  What the City of Los Angeles did to Mr. Wilkerson can never be forgiven. This is a story that should be watched by everyone who lives in Los Angeles, or anywhere to see what can happen to you, even in a free country.  Unfortunately this was the time of Senator McCarthy and no one was free.  A wonderful movie, interviews and the pictures of the 1940's Los Angeles are outstanding.",1300406400,3,695,4.448818897637795
