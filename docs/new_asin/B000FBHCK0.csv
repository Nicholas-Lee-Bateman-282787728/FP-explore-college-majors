8120232,1,B000FBHCK0,"I remember seeing this movie years ago and it made a great impression on me. As a result, I ordered the DVD and to my dismay found out that although the DVD holder stated it had English subtitles, the DVD did not. As a result, I returned it and am still waiting for a refund.  a most disappointing experience.",1434499200,2,309,4.237288135593221
8120233,5,B000FBHCK0,"As I sat watching Border Street, which totally blew all my expectations, I suddenly realized that everyone in it not only lived through World War II, they lived through it in Poland! Much of the film was shot on sets, but the bombed-out ghetto looks real. And surely it must be, as the director, Aleksander Ford (born Mosze Lifszyc in Kiev), was head of the Polish People's Army Film Crew during WWII. He was a Stalinist, which shows in this film, filled up as it is with stereotypes and characters who spontaneously break into song. But, there are still so many astonishing scenes which rush by at an increasingly feverish clip: Rolf, the black German Shepherd dog, who ""changes sides"" and becomes ""Wind"": the sweatshop where Jews nervously sew uniforms for the Nazi's; the singing of S'brent (It's Burning), the anthem of the underground Jewish resistance in Cracow during WWII;  Davidek, the young Jewish boy who answers a ringing phone in an unknown room in a burning house (a true precursor of a scene in Tarkovsky's Stalker); and the pious grandfather who prays for the sins of the Jews as he is burned alive in the Ghetto fire.

Border Street cannot honestly be compared with Polanski's great film The Pianist. Ford's film is far too fresh and all too real. You can sense the heaviness with which the actors carry themselves, the dinginess of their ""costumes"", the genuine need to tell a story to the world that is barely history. Whatever the technical difficulties, the energy of their tale burns through. This is a true original!",1363996800,5,1539,4.7819548872180455
8120234,5,B000FBHCK0,"""Border Street"" (in Polish ""Ulica graniczna"") was produced in 1949, which makes it the 2nd or third Holocaust movie, following its compatriot ""The Last Stage"" (""Ostatni etap""), filmed in Auschwitz (!) and perhaps the Czechoslovak ""Distant Journey"" of the same year. ""Border Street"" was directed by one of Poland leading directors, Aleksander Ford, himself a Jew, and tells the story of the Warsaw ghetto from the day it was opened until the end of the ghetto uprising. Ford portrays 4 very clear types: the anti-Semitic Pole (which is quite astonishing keeping in mind the movie was produced in Poland in the 40s), the Pole who feels solidarity with his Jewish brothers and tries to help as much as possible, the conservative Jew and the assimilated Jew(ess) who is totally unaware of her Jewish origins until the war begins.

The film, though occasionally old in its cinematographic language, is very effective and a true masterpiece - a Holocaust film made before the term ""Holocaust movies"" was coined. Because all movie studios in Poland were ruined during the war, Ford shot this film at the Barrandov studios in Prague with the complicity of Czech actors in minor roles.",1293321600,2,1176,5.0
8120235,5,B000FBHCK0,"For anyone who is a serious student of how the Holocaust is depicted in the media this is a must to see.  It strips away a lot of the commercialism we see in movies and tells the basic story in a unique way, considering the time it was made.",1228003200,4,241,3.9183673469387754
