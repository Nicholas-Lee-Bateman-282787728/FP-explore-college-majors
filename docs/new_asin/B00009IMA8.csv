1883439,5,B00009IMA8,"Bear does it again teaching children the seasons while entertaining at the same time. This is a good way to keep you child busy while they learn. Bear teaches values and helpful information such as seasons, shapes, colors, potty training, brushing teeth, bathing, sharing, friendship, and alot more.",1173139200,,299,5.25
1883440,4,B00009IMA8,"As with all the other Bear videos, there is learning a concept, singing and playing and the shadow puppets.  This DVD has 3 episodes, starting with Autumn, with pumpkins, piles of leaves, to Summer where they spend a lazy day swimming and relaxing, to an All-Weather episode that runs through snow, rain and fun to be had in all kinds of weather.  My 2-3/4 year old loves this DVD and since it has continuous mode play, he can watch and play while it runs in the background.  Includes 6 padded glow-in-the dark wall character stickers sure to delight any toddler.",1065744000,19,563,4.61
