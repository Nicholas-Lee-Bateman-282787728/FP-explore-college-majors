5092915,5,B007KANEDS,These films are all my favorite series of a horror film. They're all so good. I highly recommend to anyone out there.,1349481600,,117,4.363636363636363
5092916,5,B007KANEDS,This movie is freakin' awesome. Just when you think that it might be hard to top the last one somehow the creators manage to do it. I never felt as if the story line was being played out. I never expect any of the twists or turns. I'm definitely buying all three of them. Lauren McKnight is an awesome actress and Pruit is amazing at being evil. Gosh!,1336348800,,351,4.176470588235294
5092917,5,B007KANEDS,"All 3 of these movies are awesome, they are very different and that's what makes them good. I like them because they give you alot of back round of these people's lives and see how they are,then murders happen. These movies are my favorites i could watch them over and over again and not have them get old. I just wish these movies were big like on tv previews that say its out on dvd and i wish that these movies were big enough to be sold in stores so more people would buy them and more stores would make more money but since they are only on MTV they can't be i guess because it's only on tv until released only online!!!",1332892800,,625,4.0894308943089435

5092919,4,B007KANEDS,"I'm a huge fan of the first ""My Super Psycho Sweet 16"" and its sequel, I would obviously watch the third movie. I expected a lot of this movie and expected it to be better than the sequel, but it wasn't. It was a decent movie, but not nearly as good as the first two. The party only contents about eight and the movie soon gets predictable, but anyways, it still has a good climatic ending, but the for sure ending was ""Super Sweet"", but it needed more. One of the most disappointing of all, was that Chris Zylka had about two minutes of screen time. Without him, it made the movie seem like it was missing something, but anyways, it is a decent movie and one I will be adding to the collection, but when will we see a Blu-Ray release?!",1332201600,,736,4.190140845070423
8519006,4,B007KANEDS,LOVE LOVE LOVE My Super Psycho Sweet 16 series I remember watching them back in middle school and loved them so glad Amazon had them all three on dvd,1524355200,,149,4.172413793103448
8519007,3,B007KANEDS,"I gave it an okay rating simply because anyone from anywhere could have written this. it is very predictable and it goes without saying pretty childishly amateurish. Skye from the first 2 movies decides it is time to get on with life and gets a ride to her new  college. On the way here younger sister calls her who hasn't spoken with her since part 2 invites her over to her mansion. She goes, mistake #1 and I will only say that is the first of many mistakes Skye makes. As I said this was very predictable but had a few amusing parts, I have to admit I liked Nico, he was kind of fun in a good looking, needy, dorky way. Needless to say there will not and have not been any academy awards handed out but it was still a fun bit of MTV fluff. BTW, may be a bit too gory for some of the younger folk, someone gets sliced down the middle with a scythe and well entrails fall. Silly horror/suspense that really isn't.",1493337600,,915,4.140449438202247

8519013,1,B007KANEDS,"The worst in the franchise, I'm surprised it has a better rating than the first 2 parts. The quality is grainy and the you have to turn up the volume. The thing that I was so upset about was that it bleeps out the word 's***'. Very predictable the only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the ending.",1390176000,,301,4.11864406779661

8519015,4,B007KANEDS,"This movie was a real good movie. It was like I wanted it to be. Ryan Sypek, was very good. Of course it was pretty easy to figure out what was going to happen in the end. But other than that, there was action throughout the whole movie.",1355616000,,237,3.9583333333333335
