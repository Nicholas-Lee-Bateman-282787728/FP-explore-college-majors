272775,5,6300213323,"To the New Age Trekkies who are journeying with Captains Janeway
and Archer, the old crayola-colored helm and styrofoam planet sets of the original Star Trek series may seem ""cheesey"" (got that from a college Soph). However, it is the chemistry of the original crew, Kirk, Spock and Mc Coy, as well as all the crew,
that started the Star Trek Phenomenon. ""City On The Edge Of Forever"" epitomizes this chemistry. Future generation Star Trek episodes have tried to emulate this original Emmy winning ""back in time on earth"" formula (most recently ""Enterprise, Carbon Creek"" in which ""I Love Lucy"" is extolled), but the fact is, the sentiment, the feeling, the heartwarming relationships in this Joan Collins guesting episode have never been equalled. If you never saw the original Star Trek, if you never felt the chemistry that started it all, this is the episode to buy and enjoy.",1038614400,,880,4.912751677852349
272776,5,6300213323,"Why? Because she's a major league babe! If I went through the 'Guardian of Forever' Hitler never would have come into power in the first place. I would have planned my jump for France, March 1793.
After arriving in Paris, I would have saved Marie Antoinette from the guillotine during the French Revolution. Of course the Queen would have been a widow because the King was executed in January. So after I save the Queen from her Tower Prison, it would have been a snap to get her across the border, get aide from Austria, Prussia, and perhaps Russia. With Marie Antoinette back on the thrown, the monarchy would have been restored. To this day France could be a great and powerful nation and not what it is now. Hitler would have been little more than a pest and Germany would have been under France's foot by power of the Treaty of Versailles.
So you see by saving Marie Antoinette (a major league royal babe and having her all for myself)Kirk could have saved the lovely Joan Collins from a tragic death. Everyone would have been happy, Joan, Kirk, Marie Antoinette, and me. Maybe we could have all gone on a vacation to see Vina the green skinned slave dance.",1019606400,4,1162,4.538095238095238
272777,5,6300213323,"Now we come to what is clearly the most famous, most admired and most controversial Star Trek episode, ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""  As I would think most people know by know, McCoy goes back in time through the time portal of the Guardian of Forever and changes history.  Kirk and Spock follow to set things right, ending up in the U.S. during the Great Depression where they learn that the focal point in time is Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a social worker: Because McCoy will save her life, Edith will lead a peace movement that will delay U.S. involvement in World War II, allowing Hitler time to create the atomic bomb first and win the war (which is not a good thing).  Unfortunately, Kirk falls in love with Edith and does not want her to die.
Originally written by Harlan Ellison, who has published both the original script and his side of what really happened (that's an understatement), the only thing everybody can agree on is that changes were made in the script.  The biggest difference in the two versions has to do with which character prevents Edith from being saved: in the episode it is Kirk, but in the original script it is Spock.  Ellison's point was that Kirk was willing to sacrifice the future for love; the powers that be maintained their hero would not act that way.  But then they also think that two hundred years from now no one will remember Clark Gable (or ""Gone With the Wind"" apparently).
Ironically, these two opinions are enshrined in the second and third Star Trek movies, where we go from the good of the many outweighs the good of the one (Spock sacrifices live to save the ship), to the good of the one outweighs the good of the many (Kirk save Spock at the expense of his career).  I have to admit that I very much like both versions; it was years before I stopped crying when I watched the end of ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""  Yet as great as that ending is, with Kirk having nothing to say about what has happened except ""Let's get the hell out of here,"" what Ellison was attempting was even more operatic.
Ultimately, what hurts this episode the most is not the great debate over which version is superior, but that Kirk would have a different girl on a different planet for what seemed like every other episode during the rest of the series, which undermines his (supposedly) epic love for Edith Keeler.  If you have not read Ellison's script, then you should do so.  You can even skip the vitriolic account of the bad blood between Ellison and Gene Roddenberry, but there is a minor character named Trooper in the script who deserves to be remembered because he was deemed negligible by history.",1003017600,8,2653,4.519832985386222
272778,5,6300213323,"This episode is one of my favorites of all time. It has great drama, good plot, good acting and shows the character's great ability to solve problem. And, it just has that cool time continuum stuff going on.  And, the time portal - the ""guardian of forever"" (?) has inspired many other stories such as Carmen Carter's ST:TNG book, ""The Devil's Heart.""

He lands on the planet and goes through  a time portal, which strands the Enterprise crew members because he changed  history going back.

272782,5,6300213323,"McCoy accidentally injects himself with an overdose of cordrazine, a drug which makes him exhibit signs of paranoia and madness, while treating an ailing Sulu on the bridge. Delirious, he beams down to a nearby planet's  surface, with Kirk and a landing party on his heels.  They are too late to  stop the doctor from leaping through a living time machine called ""The  Guardian of Forever."" At that moment, the U.S.S. Enterprise ceases to  exist and the landing party is stranded. The Guardian explains that McCoy  went back into Earth's history and changed it, thereby altering the future.  Kirk and Spock go through the Guardian, to Depression-era America, a few  days before McCoy is to arrive and change history.  They encounter a social  worker, Edith Keeler, who helps them find work to pay for the equipment  Spock requires to build a tricorder. Unknown to Kirk and Spock, Edith has  taken in the recently-arrived and ill McCoy. Kirk promptly falls in love  with Edith and is devastated when Spock completes his tricorder and  discovers that in order to repair history, they must let Edith Keeler be  killed in an auto accident. If they allow McCoy to save her -- as he did  before -- she will start an effective pacifist movement that will delay the  United States' entrance into World War II, thus allowing Hitler's Germany  to develop the atomic bomb first and conquer the planet.  When the moment  comes, a heartbroken Kirk stops McCoy from saving Edith, and the three  officers journey back through the Guardian, where they find things as they  should be again.",939945600,4,1573,4.856603773584905
272783,5,6300213323,This is probably my favorite episode of the series along with the Doomsday Machine and Court-Martial. This episode is actually a one hour movie that you wish did not have to end the way it did. It should prove to Hollywood  that you do not need a gushy happy ending to make a fantastic show.

7807114,1,6300213323,I wanted to write a brief review to even things out a bit. I cannot understand why this episode is so popular. I found it quite unremarkable. I can only think that Joan Collins' presence in the line up is the cause of all the fuss. Spock and Kirk spend most of the episode dressed up as 1930s homeless American laborers. Is this really what Star Trek the original series is all about? Is this really 'the best'? I don't think so. I can think of many episodes that were far more enjoyable. The thrust of the story is that peace movements are bad for world peace. Yawn!,1289433600,,567,4.2592592592592595
7807115,5,6300213323,"Every Star Trek fan knows and loves this episode. Owning it is rewarding, as it can be watched again and again. But the episode raises some questions. What about Harlan Ellison's original script, which (unlike the filmed version) won a Writer's Guild of America award? What are the political implications? And there's the point another reviewer brought up... does the importance of Edith Keeler fade due to Kirk's subsequently prodigious love life?

Kirk and Spock travel back in time to 1930s Earth to fix something that went wrong due to another time traveler. (In the filmed version, this is McCoy, who accidentally suffers a drug overdose and escapes to a planet where a time portal exists.) They travel to the past and meet Edith Keeler, a Depression-era social worker with visionary ideas played by Joan Collins -- yes, THAT Joan Collins. She is luminous in this role, commanding the episode whenever she is on screen.

There's a painful twist of fate: Spock learns that if Edith Keeler does not die, she will lead a peace movement that delays the entrance of the USA into WWII, thus letting the Nazis win. Therefore Edith Keeler must die, though Kirk has fallen into love with her. I have always been disturbed by this story line, because it suggests that pacism is wrong, even though (at least at times) Trek seemed to be endorsing a platform friendly to pacifism. (But, to be fair, the Enterprise did pack a lot of weaponry, and some of the most exciting episodes involved space battles.)

Watching the episode recently on tape, I decided that the idealism more than makes up for the hedge against pacifism. Someday man will harness incredible energies and reach the stars, Edith declares, and the money now spent on death and destruction will someday be used to solve the problems of mankind rather than to hurt people. The beauty of it is that we listen to these speeches through the eyes and ears of Kirk and Spock, and we therefore ""know"" her idealism will prevail. In 1967, we DID know that mankind would survive the problems of the 30s and 40s, some of the worst that humanity ever faced. And if we survived those problems, the episode subtly suggests, we can survive the problems of the 60s or the problems of today. There is a future worth living for.

Now, as to Ellison's original script. That script had less of a role for McCoy. I find that replacing a renegade drug dealer (from the original script) with a drugged-out McCoy was probably an improvement. De Kelly, as McCoy, does some of the best acting in the entire series here, going from calm to lunatic to desperate to charming. My favorite line: ""That's quite all right dear... because I don't believe in you either.""

The biggest change deals with Kirk's decision. Can he sacrifice the woman he loves in order to save millions of people? In Ellison's original script, Kirk is blinded by love and is unable to make the right decision. According to Ellison, this made him more fallible and human, and was therefore better.

But c'mon already. In the course of Star Trek, Kirk saves the galaxy, or at least entire planets, how many times???  Would a man whose role it is to save the galaxy turn away from the right decision when the entire future is at stake? For just one woman? Could he possibly do less than Rick in Casablanca, who finally realized that the lives of a couple of people mean little when the whole world is in the balance? It is enough, I think, for Kirk to be psychologically torn apart by what he has to do... elsewhere in the series, he unfailingly does the right thing, at least by the final act, and he usually does it so easily. (A theme later explored in Star Trek II.) For our hero to suffer such a loss is asking enough. Then there is the question of whether Edith Keeler means much in light of all the affairs Kirk has later. Well, watching the tape again put my mind at ease. As I stated, Joan Collins commands the screen and takes over the episode like no guest star before her. There is never another heroine like her, not on ST nor on any ST spinoff. Edith Keeler's idealism is truly Roddenberry's own. It is not surprising that Kirk's affairs are so ephemeral after this episode. We never meet a woman of her equal again.

All the creative elements in this episode -- the writing (including the marvelous little touches of humor in the script), the acting, the music, even the cinematography are all at their finest. Depression-era New York is recreated beautifully; we are reminded that people had trouble surviving. The basic idea of the story is still Ellison's, while the nuances and fine points are due to Roddenberry, DC Fontana, and others. But in any event, the result is a poetic masterpiece, like almost nothing television ever produced.",1183075200,2,4755,4.665871121718377

7807118,5,6300213323,"Perennially voted the fan's favorite episode of the original series and, according to many surveys, the best episode of the whole Star Trek series catalogue.  This high opinion and fan devotion comes for a very good reason: 'The City On The Edge Of Forever' is a gripping story that represents television at it's very best.  Not just science fiction but all genres considered.  Kudos, plaudits, salvos, cheers, hails...nothing but the highest of praise has come from nearly all since it's original airing April 6, 1967.  During the first week of July, 1995 it was listed in TV Guide's ""100 Most Memorable Moments In TV History"", placed at number 68.  It was the only episode of any Trek series to make the distinguished list and was a very rare entry for the field of science fiction, which has never been a favorite of television critics.  In addition to this critical success every fan knows there has been a conflict surrounding this episode concerning the author of the original teleplay, Harlan Ellison, and the teleplay that appeared on the classic Trek program.  Why?  Apparently it's personal.
The story that circulated for years was that the episode as originally written was far over budget; the estimated figure that was quoted kept getting more inflated as the years passed.  There were quibbles involving certain behavior of some of the lead characters and other differences of opinion; one infamous (and erroneous) rumor was that Ellison had included a storyline that had the Enterprise's chief engineer Scotty dealing drugs!  The studio mandated rewrite has been attributed to many different people who were associated with Star Trek at that current time: Gene Roddenberry, Gene L. Coon, Steve Carabatsos, the list goes on.  Ellison wrote a book on the whole matter in an attempt to clear the air and even claims to have the definitive answer to who actually penned the rewrite that was used.  The book, which is titled the same as the episode, contains his original teleplay and it is brilliant.  But I'm afraid I quite agree with the creators of Trek that it simply was not filmable by their then current budget standards.
None of these matters has diminished the enjoyment that the finished product has brought to legions of fans.  The show grabs your attention immediately and it isn't hard to get caught up in Kirk and Spock's time warp dilemma.  Their initial encounter with the Depression era is amusing; the romance that develops between Kirk and Edith Keeler is done well and manages to avoid becoming clichd or sappy; the twist concerning the two very different futures of Edith Keeler is a complete surprise; Spock sympathetically but rationally insisting his captain allow events to proceed as they must.  Aside from these is the impressively designed and odd appearance of the Guardian Of Forever; the voice chosen for this most unusual ""alien"" is also appropriate and effective.  The end of the episode is unforgettable with Kirk and Spock's joyous reunion with McCoy shattered by the captain's need to prevent his friend from reaching to help Keeler, leading to Kirk's angry and bitter departure from the Guardian.  Additionally the well-chosen Depression era background music and accompanying contemporary score are among the best work that the series has done.  But perhaps the episode's greatest strength is Joan Collins' effectual and credible performance as Edith Keeler whose ethereal beauty is strikingly photographed in her close-ups.  Collins was well cast in the part and she and Shatner make a believable couple.
Note: When Kirk and crew prepare to transport from the surface to the ship in the end of the episode Shatner uses the word hell.  Although no television historian has made a definitive study (at least not to most people's knowledge) this is generally believed to be the first time this word was used on-air, another Star Trek television first!",1043539200,5,3897,5.029548989113531
