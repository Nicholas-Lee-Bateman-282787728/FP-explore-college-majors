8686643,4,B00P7BFOOY,"Well, yes, it's a standard feelgood flick. But at the end, you feel really good!

My only quibble is that, at the end, the father should have been crusted with salt, streaked with dried sweat and dirt, and not far from complete collapse.

Well, and then the quibble that it isn't available in North American DVD format.",1449014400,,319,4.578947368421052
8686644,5,B00P7BFOOY,"Please release in a North American/USA format!--DONE: August 2015 - Amazon Instant Video!
 By  Hugh May  on December 12, 2014
Format: DVD
When will this be released in a USA format? I love the trailers. A family member saw it on a transcontinental flight and said it was excellent. From the ""buzz"" I've read, a lot of people would like this released for a North American audience.

Update August 2015. This has now been released on Amazon as an Instant Video to rent or buy. I saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I predict it will become a classic in family fare and be of great interest in special needs venues. It portrays many great values including renewal, loyalty, and determination, plus gorgeous mountain scenery. This is a great film.",1440806400,,741,4.676923076923077
