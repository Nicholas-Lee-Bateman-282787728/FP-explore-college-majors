8542838,5,B009LEL11S,"I bought this for my high school senior, who wants to major in music education so he can give back to future high school students. It was appropriate for my son that the film focused on the teens and young adults in the performance. I found the interviews of the teachers and of the students a poigniant reminder of the trials of that age.
The interviews of the dance teachers were particularly inspiring to me. As an art educator, and an art therapist, who has worked mostly with troubled youth, I was moved by the comments from teachers to the students that the training was not just about learning to do a dance. It was training for new patterns to carry into the rest of their lives.
I was very grateful this version had subtitles. I will watch this film many, many times and share it with others.",1378080000,3,801,4.418918918918919
