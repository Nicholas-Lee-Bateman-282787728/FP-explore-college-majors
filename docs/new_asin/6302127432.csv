429431,3,6302127432,"Colgate seems to be conducting the video off the cuff.  It appears to be a single camera shoot.  Because of the lack of scripting the video wavers in content.  Colgate is not a natural in front of the camera and appears to be a bit of a task master.  For example when the 80's actors/stundents make up commands for tasks that need no command, Colgate fails to realize the fun in this and insists on eliminating the commands.  There are several gaffs in the film which make for unwitting humor.  An example is when Colgate describes tieing a square knot as easy and the actors disagree.  This is followed by a quick edit and on to the next scene leaving us to sumise that the actors were scolded for making Colgate look bad and the scene removed.  Bearing these points in mind it is still an informative video that serves its purpose of modestly educating the uninitiated.  I have never sailed before and have been reading Sailing for Beginners books prior to seeing this tape.  The tape cleared up with visuals concepts that were hard to put across in a book.  Colgate certainly does know what he is talking about but I agree he does sometimes drift into areas that a beginner has no interest in.  As for the 80's quality of the video, I enjoyed it.  Audrey Landers is the female student of the two and the video renewed my pubescent fantasies of her having graduated high school in 85.  Another flaw is the obvious lack of followup.  Sailing is certainly a task that must ultimately be learned hands on but a video SERIES would certainly be a great aide, especially to those of us trying to learn sailing while looking at snow in our front yard.  Colgate should have opted for a series of 4 or 5 videos with a professional narator.  Worth $20 to buy, not much more.  I found it at my local library and was fantastic for that price.",1084406400,,1832,4.434131736526946
429432,1,6302127432,"I coudn't stand this video.  From the get go he stutters, pauses, ""ah""s  and ""um""s continuously.  The text is not scripted, nor is it conversational.  I think he had stage fright in front of the camera. He needs to learn how to speak. As a result, I could not listen any more, and certainly nothing useful was absorbed of the footage I did watch.  The intro cut scenes, every 1 - 2 seconds, made no sense and was unnerving.  Although there was some good camera footage here and there, it was edited poorly.  He may be a god sailor, but he is certainly a lousy narrator.",1027641600,,569,4.311320754716981
429433,5,6302127432,"First off this is a great video content-wise. The worst part about this video is It looks to have been filmed late 70's early 80's. There are several points where the sound cuts out and background noise like, someone hammering a steel drum, over powers the instructor and students.
The content however is top notch! It was very helpful. The quality of instruction is just superb. Many books I have seen showing proper technique show photos from this series. The boat they use does not lend itself to 2 more people required, so the soundman and cameraman ride next to the sailboat in a powerboat, which as you guessed it makes more noise than the instructor. The live sailing demonstrations do not show line handling and steering as well as I would have liked. However this is all shown very well dockside.
Albeit the sound is poor and the video needs to be refilmed, this is still a great first time sailor's video. It replaces several weeks of in class instruction, and can be watched over and over again.
Great Video.",985910400,5,1019,4.6353591160221

7821652,1,6302127432,"I ordered this with the notion that it was the Sail Away TV show that aired in 2001. It is not. On the selling page it clearly states the actors who were on the Sail Away TV Show and the writers of said tv show. This information is misguiding and I when I got it in the mail today I was saddened to see that it wasn't the fun show I watched in 2001, but something completely different.

7821653,1,6302127432,"title should say it all, this is a 80's VHS tape placed onto a DVD... with awful actors and a poor script with bad jokes. Just not something you can spend time watching for anything other than the mystery science theater effect.",1272931200,,228,4.4523809523809526
7821654,2,6302127432,"This book starts at the basics - I mean the VERY basics and moves slowly - very slowly (hence my jibe that it needed an outboard!).

Also, this was shot like back in the seventies.  The quality isn't as good as a DVD and back then they weren't quite as fussy with audio as they would be today.

Perhaps the very latest parts of this video might actually get into real sailing know-how, but my popcorn and attention span ran out long before that time.",1228521600,,450,4.270588235294118
7821655,2,6302127432,"The instructor (Steve Colgate) is very thorough and clear, but the DVD does not do justice.

There's a LOT of vocabulary to cover. A new DVD might break out the detailed vocabulary first, then more conceptual items, and finally how it works/looks in practice. (A clearer categorization of these segments is what is needed here.)

The vocabulary could be done one on one.

Concepts require diagrams and theory to be grasped - a more graphical approach (some are presented, but more can be done with animation, etc).

Practice should be filmed better and up close, and probably not with students at the helm (watching someone else learning while underway I found to be confusing. A better technique would be to have the expert showing...this is a ... tack, notice the wind is... and now we will... instead of watching newbies trying to learn it in the middle of it - this could be fine as a bonus, but not as primary learning material). The authority, certainty of example could be a far clearer way to present this material.

I completely agree with the issues presented here on sound quality, viewing angles - particularly in the actual sailing session. This session is muddy, not up close enough to be of value. Drawing the connecting lines between concepts (i.e. present a diagram) then showing how it looks in practice (a segment that displays the concept) would be a great idea. Far too little time is provided in actual sailing - and conceptual comparison - to drive the points home. (I seemed to learn the concepts, but making the connection to what it looks like on the water didn't happen - my mind wasn't making the connections back to the diagrams. Editing could do this for the viewer and cement those connections.)

A modified producing of this material would make this very useful. Using a little educational knowledge, combined with technical capabilities (now available, but not previous on VHS) this could be an excellent DVD. In fact, it could easily be broken out into 3 lower priced DVDs and provide greater clarification as well as more in-depth understanding of how things actually look on the water.

This isn't a bad DVD, it's just that you'd have to watch it A LOT to be able to get any understanding of the theory you learn, and how that will look in practice. The way it's designed, you have to MASTER the vocabulary and conceptual material before the practice feels natural. Guide the viewer through this mastering...maybe the advanced DVD of the series could then be entirely in mastered vocabulary.

The DVD environment should provide enough familiarity so that a person feels at least some comfort with what to expect in action.

The instructor clearly has a lot to share, and can do so if the presentation is polished. This could become a very effective learning tool if the effort to improve it were undertaken.",1225584000,,2843,4.7975460122699385
7821656,1,6302127432,"Steve Colgate is probably the best know sailing instructor in the US.  This video let's him down.

The professional actors in the video are useless, other than the blonde adding a little color.  Steve would have been better off standing there by himself, teaching the viewer.  In parts of the video, there is clearly noisy shipyard work in the background.  It's hard to hear Steve speak.

You may pick up some of the basic vocabulary, but that's it.

I highly recommend Bud Foulke's ""Sailing With Confidence video.""  I bought both on Amazon.",1156032000,9,541,4.804347826086956
7821657,2,6302127432,"I didn't get it. I want to learn but this only teaches the preliminary basics that I've read in books. I wanted a DVD so I could see ""in action"" how to sail. The dock portion (beginning) is ok. When they set sail, it's filmed from a powerboat that keeps a distance so that you can't see the details of what they're doing. The sound is terrible. The soundtrack is painful. I have seen better production from first year high schools. I could go on but I am trying to find a professional ""How to Sail"" DVD right now.",1107907200,17,513,4.191919191919192
7821658,4,6302127432,"Originally released on VHS tape in the early eighties, this presentation has probably been seen by more new sailors than any other.  Condensed from a week long sailing course, renowned Olympic sailor Steve Colgate expertly instructs Audrey Landers (from TV's 'Dallas') and Sam Jones ('Flash Gordon, the Movie') on how to sail.
All necessary topics are covered, including boarding the boat, terminology, setting the sails, a few knots, points of sail, maneuvers (i.e. tacking and gibing) and rescuing a crew member overboard -- to name but a few.  The presentation is concise and easy to understand.
The footage is culled from a week long course, so there are one or two scenes that touch from each principle area of Steve's instruction.  The participants are clearly actually learning to sail.  The errors they make are not edited out, so you can see the result of making them.  Near the end, Steve states that the course MUST be taken while getting some practical experience as well.  This is very important.  View the presentation a few times prior to going out, then review it again between sails, and you'll get the maximum benefit.  Repeat as needed.
Drawbacks:
The conversion to DVD apparently had a few minor problems -- i.e.: when the highlight is on 'PLAY' and you push your select button, the CHAPTER menu is presented.  Conversely, if 'CHAPTER' is highlighted and you press select, the DVD plays from the beginning. If you use the CHAPTER menu, the very first chapter is not an available choice for some reason.  If on the other hand you simply play the DVD, you will see the mysterious first chapter -- explaining a bit about the Soling.
The program is also a bit dated. For example, if you were born after 1965, you won't recognize these actors; the term 'Man overboard' is used instead of the politically correct 'Crew Overboard'; and the music score is kind of hokey -- but the skills required for sailing haven't changed, so who cares?  I don't...
Overall I rate this 4-stars, since the required skills are covered well, and the drawbacks mentioned above are aesthetic or mechanical and do not affect the content.  If you are a newbie sailor, and you are learning the sport on your own, this is a must have DVD.",1088294400,12,2227,4.785900783289817
