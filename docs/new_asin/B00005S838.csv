1658631,4,B00005S838,"Sometimes videos labelled as ""advanced"" are doable for those at earlier levels, but not this one; it is definitely designed specifically for the advanced Pilates student.  You will need two prerequistes in order to successfully complete this video:  1) familiarity with the entire range of Pilates movements, including advanced exercises such as the Jacknife, and 2) enough pre-existing core strength to allow you to perform the aforementioned advanced moves at a fast pace.
This advanced workout is performed in the traditional Pilates style, which means there are a very low number of repetitions (even less than most other Pilates videos, sometimes only 2-3) combined with a flowing pace to the workout.  Each movement flows into the next without any pauses, which means that you are in constant motion for the entire duration of this workout.  While this IS how Joseph Pilates intended these exercises to be performed, it can make the video a bit difficult to follow, despite Hilary Burnett's excellent voiceover cuing.  Hilary provides little explanation of how to perform each movement, but she does offer metaphors to assist you.  At just over 20 minutes, this is a very good Pilates routine for those looking for a fast-paced, very challenging workout.",1076284800,31,1260,5.212871287128713
1658632,5,B00005S838,"This tape is a pleasure.  The best time I've ever had with a pilates video.  I would recommend it to people who have a good foundation in pilates.  Hilary gives evocative and precise instruction - but I wouldn't call it detailed....  I ordered the Intermediate, Advanced, and Zen Stretch - and I love all three tapes.
Unlike most pilates videos, there's never a dull moment! The program is short - less than 25 minutes and moves very very quickly through an advanced mat series that includes some of the more exotic routines (the crab, the corkscrew, jacknives).  Part of the work of pilates is learning to hold your core while moving with grace and speed through the various exercises, and thats what Hilary emphasizes here.
The set is really lovely - dark, candlelit, with animal prints - a bit on the ski lodge side - but it works.  The music is very nice, original, classical guitar.  Hilary is poised and elegant.  You feel like she's letting you in on dancer secrets Jennifer Kries would never tell you.  The core abdominal work is very powerful and effective.  The movements are beautifully executed.  She's an inspiration.
I felt noticeably better after I did this tape.  Tall, strong, stretched and centered.  The next day I actually found myself daydreaming about doing the tape again!  Some might balk at the $19 price tag for a 25 minute tape, but wow, its 25 minutes that will change your day, and your body.",1011657600,12,1421,4.700404858299595
1658633,5,B00005S838,"Hilary Burnett's PILATES ADVANCED is a Master Class in Pilates.  I was amazed at the intensity and heat the workout created!  I am a Pilates and Yoga instructor and thought I would be able to do all of the exercises in this video the first time through, but I must humbly admit that I could not!  Hilary progresses through the workout like a dancer as she flows from one sequence to another.  There are many Pilates exercises and variations in this video that I had not seen before (such as the Boomerang and Crab - impossible to describe, but amazing to see Hilary perform them).  The workout moves quickly from one exercise to the next without rest so your core muscles are constantly engaged.  As the time flew by, I felt I had worked my entire body to a degree I had not in other Pilates videos.
The setting is nothing short of stunning, with a backdrop of candles, African inspired decor, lowlighting, brass and marble.  Hilary herself is a joy to watch and performs all exercises flawlessly with appropriate cuing and precise instruction.  I wound up purchasing 2 other Pilates videos by Hilary because the advanced is so classy and inspiring.
You will not be disappointed in this challenging workout that will be there for you to aspire to as you become stronger and leaner at the same time.",1007337600,38,1298,4.613043478260869
1658644,2,B00005S838,I own several Pilates DVDs but this is the first time that I bought one by Hilary Burnett. I am not crazy about this one. I don't see why she is in such a hurry to move from one thing to another. It is annoying. I have done advanced pilates for a while and it is not necessary to rush it along to get a good workout.,1272240000,,316,3.7313432835820897
1658645,1,B00005S838,"This video lasts 22 minutes. Hilary goes from one pilates pose to the next within seconds. You do each pose for 2-4 reps. So, you never feel like you are working. The hardest part of this video is keeping up with her change of poses. I am a strong person, and like a challenge. There was no physical challenge to this video.",1265414400,6,324,4.241935483870968
1658646,4,B00005S838,"I enjoy this quick 20 minute intense (for pilates) workout.  It really is not for someone who isn't completely familiar with the exercises or positions though.  The moves are quick and are not explained, so you need to know what each one is.
I find it effective and enjoy doing this in the morning to wake up and get my blood flowing.",1265328000,,334,4.370967741935484
1658647,1,B00005S838,I was very disappointed with this DVD because it is not advanced.  The technique and routine are at a intermediate level only.,1250640000,,126,4.7272727272727275
1658648,5,B00005S838,"I appreciate the efficiency of this DVD.  The background is soothing, Hilary is powerful and elegant, and she quickly moves through a routine that is productive.  I use it several times per week and it has helped my running.  It produces strength and vigor, all in a relaxing and beautiful setting.  It is refreshing to play the DVD and move through the workout.  No relentless instruction, no annoying intros.  Just results.  Love it.",1238716800,,435,4.876712328767123
1658649,5,B00005S838,"This is one of my favorite pilates dvds.  It has sooo many interesting and fun moves that you don't even feel like you are working out! I look forward to doing it regularly.  The background is beautiful, Hilary's voice is soothing and the work out will kick your butt.  You will get into positions that you haven't since elementary school.  I feel more flexible than my 13 year old daughter! You will be amazed at your core strength. LOVE it!  I would buy ANY new dvd that she comes out with...I trust her.",1217203200,,506,4.397849462365591
1658650,4,B00005S838,"I usually supplement it with another workout.  It could be a little more vigorous, maybe more repetitions.  The instructor is encouraging and calming.",1196121600,,150,5.478260869565218
1658651,5,B00005S838,"I really like this and other Burnett workouts. They are not easy, but don't wear you out either. I bought all three of her workouts and you can make them as easy or as hard as you want. I love them! I prefer these videos over the windsor pilates tapes. I really like that it is just me and Hilary working out together, I enjoy the personal attention and has great cueing. I recommend this and all Hilary's videos.",1180483200,,413,4.2405063291139244
1658652,4,B00005S838,"...which I sure am not.  This video was very challenging and fast paced but would be a great workout for those advanced at pilates.  This workout is 20 plus minutes long and packs a lot of exercises in a short amount of time.  You move from one exercise to the other very quickly.  The exercises you will see in this routine are the hundred, rollup, rollover, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, scissors, double leg lower lift, twist, spine stretch, open leg rocker, corkscrew, saw, swan dive, single and double leg kick, neck pull, scissors (advanced), bicycle, shoulder bridge, spine twist, jackknife, high bridge, side kick series, teasers, hip circles, swimming, leg pull front, leg pull, kneeling side kicks, sidebends, twist I & II, boomerang, seal, crab, rocking, control balance and pushups.  There are few reps for each exercise and literally no rest or stopping in between.

I like Hilary as an instructor, here she instructs as a voiceover which I normally don't care for but it doesn't bother me here.  I  would think it would be pretty tough to call and cue the moves while doing them.  She makes the moves look effortless too, I was impressed with her, plus I like her style.

This video is far too advanced for me, but would be a good choice for those who practice pilates that are looking for a challenge.  Hilary's intermediate video is another good choice for those not quite ready for this one.",1135987200,11,1450,4.7370517928286855
1658653,5,B00005S838,"I'm new to the pilates game (1 year) and bought Hilary's Basic Pilates tape to start.  At 35 years old and in fair shape (I had no workout routine previous to this but do a lot of running around ""mommy stuff""), I was very happy to do some of the moves.  I was also very pleased with Hilary's very easy instructions and beautiful backgrounds and after 2 months I jumped to her Advanced tape.

Although the flow of the tape was challenging at first, it moves very fast requiring some background knowledge of basic pilates or watching the tape several times, I kept at it.  The first couple months I did the routine everyday until I memorized it.  Now, after a year, I haven't tired of the tape because Hilary emphasizes quality with every move and I can challenge myself each time to do better.  There's always room for improvement with these moves!  Hilary is encouraging and the voice overs are clear and easy to understand.  As with the first tape, the background is beautiful and relaxing with candles and gentle guitar sounds.

During the tape, along with Hilary's voice-over instruction, there are titles to let you know what pilates position you are starting.  And at 20 minutes, you will do lots of them.  Being a mother of 2, this was the perfect tape to squeeze into my day to get my figure back.  And speaking of which, if you do this everyday you WILL see results!",1106006400,5,1374,4.518218623481781
7953190,4,B00005S838,"I like that it pushes me, Im not quite that ready for advanced so also bought the Internediate DVD",1519344000,,98,4.2105263157894735
7953191,1,B00005S838,"The only problem was that I requested the advanced cd and was sent the intermediate.
  I was o.k. with that because the disc I had was fairly worn out. If you have the intermediate one
  I would appreciate it if possible",1418256000,,220,4.2926829268292686
7953192,5,B00005S838,This is my favorite pilates workout!,1414800000,,36,5.166666666666667
7953193,2,B00005S838,This is a very high paced workout that goes through each exercise too quickly.  It made me sweat but not feel the burn of a good workout.  I think she does well talking you through each exercise but maybe if reps were increased it would be more effective.  Not what I expected at all for an advanced workout.  I did the ten minute solution tighten in tone pilates right after I was done to make a more effective workout.,1400457600,,420,4.2784810126582276
7953194,5,B00005S838,She is fast pace you need to watch it first you will get a work out and learn new stuff,1394150400,,87,3.4
7953195,2,B00005S838,"I bought this DVD a few years ago because I was no longer living in a location where there were Pilates classes available.  Or, well, there were Pilates classes available but I felt like they were all very beginner level and I had little to benefit from because I was doing many advanced moves in my class.  I wanted something to help me maintain my practice.

The good side about this DVD is that it did, in fact, have all of the movements I was hoping to find.  All of the moves I had been doing in my class.  However... the bad side is that it is too ridiculously fast.  It's like she's in a race or something.  It's like I hardly got into the one move and she's flipping around to the next already.  And, sometimes it wasn't just how fast she'd switch but the number of reps.  I really like doing more reps of the movement and staying with it longer than she does.

Like, I'm not even kidding you -- all the moves she does in this video I did in my 50 minute pilates class at the gym.  Imagine fitting all those advanced moves of a 50 minute class, take out the warm up and cool down, and jam it all into 20 minutes -- that's what this video is.

Needless to say, I think I've only used the DVD like twice.  Sometimes I'd only use it to be reminded of the moves and then just do it on my own and on my own pace... which is fine, but still not what I'd prefer to do if I had the choice.",1377302400,2,1389,3.989130434782609
7953196,5,B00005S838,"Yes, I loved it. It moves fast, and gives a great workout. I warm up before the session then flow right into it.",1369699200,,112,3.9130434782608696
7953197,5,B00005S838,"This video moves through the Pilates exercises in the way Joe intended -- quickly and fluidly.  It is a nice alternative to Vinyasa Yoga.  It is twenty minutes in length, but twenty minutes of advanced moves that must be placed correctly and worked deeply.  It is focused and deep work.  Get. It.",1353715200,,296,4.634615384615385
7953198,1,B00005S838,"I ordered this video because I love Pilates, wanted a challenging Pilates workout, and was terribly disappointed by this joke of a video. For one thing, it's only about 20 minutes long - which I guess is my fault, I should've paid closer attention to the product details before I ordered (standard Pilates workouts are at least 40-45 minutes. If it's a video and it's shorter, they're usually more segments to it, that you can chose from).

I have lots of complaints about this video:the bad lighting, the fact the instructor Hilary Burnett was alone, (more workout ""helpers"" would aid in demonstrating the moves correctly, and provide alternative variations to the moves)...Her voice-over was muffled (she doesn't actually talk while doing the ""workout""...But the biggest problem is that Hilary goes through a seemingly endless series of moves, but spends less than 15 seconds on each one. I know Pilates is about quick but controlled, concentrated movements, but this was ridiculous. How can you expect to tone and shape any part of your body when you're doing over 20 moves in 20 minutes, and spending such a short time on each move? You can't. It seemed more like Ms. Burnett was trying to impress us with some of the more complicated moves she was able to do, without caring if the users were actually getting a good workout.

More attention and time should have been spent on each move, to actually train and tone the specified body part. She should have had other instructors there, the set was poorly lit and her instructions were hard to follow. In short - a waste of time and money,",1325289600,2,1592,4.785454545454545
7953199,3,B00005S838,"Very time efficient workout, with a smooth flow between exercises. The instructor has a massively annoying new-age whisper, so be prepared for that.",1283817600,,148,5.478260869565218
