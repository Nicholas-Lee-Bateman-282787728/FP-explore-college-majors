8424702,5,B003H9LISY,"Adorable, This is a lovely tale about God, about the reality of Death, about the complexity of Love. As usual, even when topics are serious, Eric-Emmanuel Schmidt lights up his story with a ""bon enfant"" philosophy, which helps remember that happiness depends mostly on the way we take what life sends us. This is one of these books that you cannot ever forget, and it reads easily, with delight.",1437955200,,395,4.739130434782608
