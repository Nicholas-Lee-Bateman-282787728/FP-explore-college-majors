8262531,4,B0016GOJW2,"Sameer (Salman Khan) moves to Goa and falls in love with Rani (Priyanka Chopra). Unfortunately, he keeps unintentionally injuring her father (Amrish Puri), thus ruining his chances of a romance with her.  Then, Sunny (Akshay Kumar) moves to the same house as Sameer, and also falls in love with Rani.  Sunny finds way after way of discrediting Sameer with Rani, and seems to be succeeding in making her fall for him.

This is a cute romantic comedy, with such bright colors throughout the entire movie, in both costumes and setting.  The music is okay, and some of the dance numbers are lovely.  The plot seems predictable, but has a unexpected ending.  Kumar plays his role so well that I genuinely disliked him.  Khan is charming and innocent as Sameer, but Chopra's acting seems stilted.  Overall, though, it's a fun movie to watch, just not exceptional.",1493596800,,857,4.862068965517241
8262532,5,B0016GOJW2,Wicked Sonny! Ha hahahaha. Fun movie to watch. The story line was cute. It started from whence Salman and Akshay were in secondary school and ends with them as young men. A great friend movie.,1443657600,,192,4.514285714285714
8262533,4,B0016GOJW2,Love Hindu movies. And as usual was pleased. You cannot go wrong with Salman Khan.,1436140800,,82,4.533333333333333
8262534,5,B0016GOJW2,"Great! Even better than anticipated & it is on several ""must see"" lists.",1432771200,,72,4.615384615384615
8262535,2,B0016GOJW2,"The movie is good but the blu ray quality isn't. I'm not sure whether this is because its an older movie but sometimes the picture gets dark, grainy, colors are off. I'm returning it because its not worth the amount I paid for it. I bought blu ray for exceptional picture quality and sound - this blu ray is equivalent to a knock off. Note my review is for the blu ray quality only,  not the seller in any way.",1422576000,,410,4.125
8262536,5,B0016GOJW2,"Absolutely love this movie.  Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan, and Priyanka Chopra all have great chemistry.  These actors are at their best when it's a light comedy and they don't disappoint here.",1368662400,,190,5.096774193548387
8262537,2,B0016GOJW2,"Don't buy this movie unless you are a huge fan of Priyanka, Akshay, or Salman, or have clinical depression and need something painfully goofy to make it through the night. And for the love of Ganesh, do not let this be your first Bollywood movie because you'll never watch another one after this. Unless you are five years old, in which case you might like the over-the-top screwball acting, transparent plotline, and uninspired dance numbers.
Why two stars instead of one?
The technical quality of this Blu-ray is good, the picture is crystal clear, and English subtitles work fine. The movie was shot in Goa, which is nice. It has Priyanka Chopra in it. Also, it stars Priyanka Chopra. Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan have a lot of fans and you might be one of them. Priyanka Chopra is in it. You might like the songs. Salman takes his shirt off a lot so if you're into that sort of thing, go for it. Oh, also, this movie has Priyanka Chopra in it.",1316390400,13,947,4.479768786127168

IT IS VERY INTERESTING, FUNNY, A BIT SEXY NOT SEXUAL, thanks God.  it is not in english but it has subtitles, I personally love forein movies.",1295222400,8,350,3.915492957746479
