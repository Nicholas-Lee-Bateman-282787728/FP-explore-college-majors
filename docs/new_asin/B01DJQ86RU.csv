7713236,5,B01DJQ86RU,"I was delighted to finally see the release of this gem cartoon. This is a must have for any Giligans Island fan or retro cartoon collector for which I am both. I liked Giligans Planet but I must say I prefer The New Adventures Of Giligan much better it's almost like this was season 4 and 5, the only sad part was no voice talents of Dawn Wells or Tina Loiuse which would have made this a diamond and what's with a white haired Ginger ? I'm sure it was so Tina couldn't sue over the likeness, but all in all this cartoon is a total bring back of joys from my childhood do thank you filmation or who ever released this on DVD. Now if I could just see Jeannie the cartoon based on I Dream Of Jeannie to get its complete series release I'd be in heaven.",1459209600,14,750,4.040268456375839

7713249,5,B01DJQ86RU,The character designs are flawless. The humor is light but captures a feel of the live show. Warner did an amazing job restoring the episodes.,1471996800,,142,4.72
7713250,5,B01DJQ86RU,"I enjoyed every episode of the cartoon series. It's about time they got it on dvd. When are they going to put the other cartoons like Archies tv funnies, U.S. of Archie and other Filmation cartoons? Journey to the Center of the Earth, Fantastic Voyage and the Hardy Boys?",1470960000,2,271,4.551020408163265
7713251,4,B01DJQ86RU,The series picks up where the original left off.  Really funny stories and not an overuse of stock footage thanks to an bigger budget provided by ABC television at the time.  A really great blast from the past!,1470182400,2,210,4.5
7713252,5,B01DJQ86RU,"Being a huge fan of past ""Saturday Mornings"" and remembering when cartoons would be created from live TV shows and movies, this is a great addition to anyone's collection.  There are actually TWO Gilligan's Island cartoons, this one and one called ""Gilligan's Planet"" (which is also available on DVD).  I like this cartoon mostly for it's nostalgia and remembering when it, and many others, flooded my Saturday mornings.  It's so nice to be able to see it again and it kind of makes me feel like a kid when I watch it.",1469145600,5,518,4.608695652173913
7713253,4,B01DJQ86RU,"Sherwood Schwartz teamed with Filmation for this show, ""Gilligan's Planet"", and ""The Brady Kids"" and do a nice job in adding some pro-social lessons on Teamwork, Tolerance, and Friendship to the supposedly ""mindless"" branded live-action Gilligan's Island"" concept.

The appearance of Fake Ginger (platinum blonde Kim Novak-caricature instead of a Tina Louise likeness) and Fake Mary Ann (Dawn Wells was busy acting on stage and was replaced by Filmation female voice regular Jane Webb) can be offset with the original cast reunion (great voices of Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr, Jim Backus, Natalie Schaefer, and Russell Johnson)  for the most part.  Harmless and the animation was typical Filmation (repeated background designs and character movements) but it did the job in entertaining.",1467849600,3,784,5.462809917355372
7713254,5,B01DJQ86RU,I did watch some cartoons and i will watch the rest.,1467590400,,52,3.8181818181818183
7713255,4,B01DJQ86RU,"Of course not as good as the TV series but it's good to hear the voices of the cast minus Dawn Wells and Tina Louise. I do remember seeing these as a kid but couldn't for the life of me remember any episodes. Sort of like Gilligan's Planet cartoon instead of an alien who Gilligan befriends it's a little chimp. He's not as annoying as that little green alien. I do find May Ann's voice a bit annoying. Sort of too loud almost reminds me of a goth girl. Ginger's voice is ok but no idea why the white hair. I heard some say so Tina Louise can't sue them. The cast don't even get residuals on the tv series let alone the rights to the cartoon character Schwartz does. Filmation is known to reuse images and scenes in each episode.
I wish they talked to someone behind the scenes at Filmation of the making of or some stories. Only extras are the bumpers that included the characters of The Groovie Goolies w/ Gilligan and Skipper.",1467590400,2,929,4.284090909090909

7713282,1,B01DJQ86RU,"I really didn't have high hopes for this show before ordering it. And once I watched all the episodes it was pretty crummy as I expected it to be. But I'm a huge Gilligan's Island fan and really wanted to see this. I know it's a stupid show, the jokes aren't funny, blah blah blah, I don't care- I love, no adore, Gilligan's Island and I always will. I'm well aware that my admiration comes more from being of a sucker of nostalgia than an eagle eyed critic, but I don't care. Those original 98 episodes I could watch over and over again with glee. This later version does not live up.

If you think that this is going to be like the long lost 4th season of Gilligan's Island you're going to be really disappointed. It's really more of a crummy 70's cartoon show that's Gilligan-themed than an animated Gilligan's Island. But that's really no surprise. In the dark ages of cartoons, between 1966 (when the Flintstones ended) and the late 80's (Roger Rabbit, the Little Mermaid, the Simpsons) this is what there was.

They didn't capture what the island looked like from the original series. The huts were all huge and made of wood. And yeah, the Skipper is a portly gentleman but not morbidly obese as seen here. Mrs. Howell is about 30 years younger here and made to be far less intelligent. Ginger has white hair (she was not voiced by Tina Louise) and the woman doing Mary Ann's voice (both Dawn Wells and Tina Louise did not participate in this show) got things way off. She's not the sweet and kind farm girl from Kansas we all love as perfectly portrayed by Dawn Wells. Gilligan, the Professor, and Mr. Howell are about right, but Howell is a little more villainous.

The series is aimed at kids. Everyone is much more immature as they would be in the original series. And every episode ends with the Skipper and Gilligan in their hammocks discussing what the learned that day. Remember the Gilligan's Island episode where the Howells were going to commit suicide because they thought they lost all their money? And then the only reason they decided not to kill themselves was because they found out that they were still rich and the former news reports were wrong? There's nothing like that here. The Skipper doesn't even hit Gilligan on the head with his cap.

If you're as big of a Gilligan fan like I am you're going to want to see this, even though you're going to have low expectations for it- which pretty much makes anything I've said a moot point. So non-Gilligan's Island fans, don't buy this. And Gilligan's Island fans, buy this, be disappointed, and just be satisfied in the fact that you saw this in the first place.",1465257600,,2636,4.531512605042017

7713285,4,B01DJQ86RU,"I am a very big Gilligan's island fan and always have been. I am 55 years old but still always remember being a pre-teen watching syndicated episodes of the series. Of course I have the original series on DVD. I also have collected all three of the Gilligan's Island movies (Rescue from GI, The Castaways on GI, The Harlem Globetrotters on GI) which are stories in of themselves. I also own ""Dusty's Trails"" which is a western version of GI created by Sherwood Schwartz but did not last long. That is a story for a different time. I own some of the GI specials that aired over the years as well as episodes of other TV shows such as 'Bonanza' that featured Dawn Wells or Tina Louise. I also have a few movies that feature these actresses as well. I even have some old commercials featuring some of the cast members of GI.
Saying all that, it is probably very obvious why I have been waiting for both this series and 'Gilligan's planet' to finally come to DVD in order to complete my collection of official Gilligan's Island programs. I would be lying if I said that this series is a great one. Simply put, it is not. However, it does have the voice talents of all of the castaways minus Dawn Wells and Tina Louise (which is extremely disappointing). At least the sequel 'Gilligan's Planet' has Dawn Wells back.
This show is a very 'kid friendly' series. All of the episodes contain some kind of lesson at the end of the story. The animation is very inexpensive and choppy. The characters always wear the same clothes every episode to make it easier on the animators and also helps them to be able to re-use the same cells over and over again.
As stated by another reviewer, you will not see the humorous 'violence' from the original. The stories are not particularly funny. If you are a GI fan you will very likely want to pick up both this series and its sequel. If you are just into nostalgia retro Saturday morning cartoons from the 70s, (a.k.a. Superfriends) then you may also want to pick this up. If you have young children you also may want to pick this up since there is nothing objectional in this series. But if you are neither of these above I would say you probably would quickly become bored with this series. It is not a bad series but it is obviously not for everyone. Hopefully this will help a little.",1461715200,17,2318,4.430913348946135
7713286,3,B01DJQ86RU,"I was a huge Gilligan's Island fan growing up, and I did watch this cartoon series as a kid back in 1974.  However, this is not a great cartoon series. The animation is only fair. And the creators of this cartoon (with pressure from executives) have left out any hint of the ""mild violence"" that made much of the regular series funny and fun.  You will not see the Skipper hitting Gilligan over the head with his skippers cap. You will not see the Skipper chasing Gilligan around the island after he's done something stupid.  You will not see the Skipper being hit in the belly followed by his patented ""Oop!"".  There is little slapstick here. This is primarily a moral based series designed to teach life lessons to young children.  Every episode ends with some moral to live ones life by.  That is all well and good I suppose, but much of the fun and funny moments are missing as a result of the restrictions. It simply doesn't have much in the way of the old ""Gilligan feel"" to it. However, if you love Gilligan as I do and want to hear the voices of Bob Denver, Alan Hale, Russell Johnson, Natalie Schafer and especially Jim Backus, who's still funny here (Dawn Wells and Tina Louise are not present), you will find nostalgic enjoyment in this cartoon series. Like many of you, I am a Gilligan fan after-all. And even though this cartoon series isn't the best, it's still worth having in the true fans collection.",1459641600,20,1417,4.494163424124514

8756118,5,B01DJQ86RU,"I loved this seried. At 24 episodes it almost constitutes a full fourth season of Gilligan's Island (especially since the live action series was so cartoony to begin with). Even without Dawn Wells and Tina Louise reprising their roles, having the rest of the cast back really helps to make the illusion feel complete. There was even a bonus collection of Gilligan bumpers used when the episodes were rebroadcast as part of ""The Groovy Goolies and Friends"". A nice little touch that made it feel like real thought was put into the production of this DVD. 5 stars for this set. I can hardly wait to buy ""Gilligan's Planet"".",1515888000,,621,4.706422018348624

Very colorful and creative and a great bit of nostalgia featuring most of the original castaway voices. Ginger is a bit light headed for my taste here and in Planet (were Dawn Wells does the honors) but Jane Webb does a decent Mary Ann! Very fun to see again after so many years.
