8036150,1,B0004ILMJQ,"Just how hard is it to produce a meaningful sailing instruction DVD? Apparently it is very hard because I have never seen a good one, they all range from bad to mediocre. This one is bad. Not bad for a single particular reason, but bad universally. The ""tips"" are trivial and borderline useless and one gets the feeling the whole thing was produced in a day of shooting on a digicam.

After watching Captain Pete explaining intricate rituals of lowering ones anchor you may be tempted to ask yourself ""Why am I watching this""

A short answer is ""Who knows"". Read a book instead.",1155340800,4,578,4.548076923076923
8036151,1,B0004ILMJQ,"Pot-bellied Cap'n Pete pontificates on the importance of having the halyard securely attached before attempting to raise the jib.  Too bad he never actually shows us how.  Blonde Angie, whose nautical attire includes a very short skirt, bends waaaay over as she tries to follow the Cap'n's instructions.  How high will her skirt ride up her lovely thighs?  Not high enough to make this DVD worth watching.  Absolutely the worst instructional video I've ever seen.",1137801600,11,463,5.12
