1988503,4,B0001CNRA2,"This is one of the most underrated movie of the 1970's.  Jill Clayburgh is absolutely first-rate in her portrayal of Carole Lombard and James Brolin is surprisingly dead-on as Clark Gable. The movie begins at the site of the plane crash that killed Lombard and flashes back to the beginning of Gable and Lombard's risky and soulful love affair.  Critics destroyed this movie when it was released nearly 4 decades ago, but I urge everyone to give it a shot.  The production design is faultless, the musical score is lush and romantic, and the performances are terrific.  I plan on being the first one to buy it.",1080000000,30,610,4.672897196261682
1988554,5,B0001CNRA2,"This has become my favorite love story of all time. I can watch it over and over again and never tire of the love story and the comedy put forth in this wonderful movie. You forget who the actors are as they become GABLE and LOMBARD and you get caught up in their love life and their fight to keep it no matter what people say!
A truly heartfelt LOVE STORY!",1473552000,,357,4.042253521126761

1988556,5,B0001CNRA2,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters. At that time I was about 17 years old, and knew Carole Lombard and Clark Gable very well from watching the Million Dollar Movie and the Late Show with my parents. This movie is not the best bio-pic out there, but I love it just the same. Was there some poetic license taken with the story of these two magnificent movie stars...yes, of course there was, but it is still very entertaining and is one of my favorite 'guilty pleasure' movies. I guess some people might think that is comes off as a little dated, and the answer is of course yes, but as a huge film fan I look at the movie for what it is now some 40 years later. It's a simple story portrayed by two actors that I always adored, and they play the parts of  these iconic film stars pretty well. Lets face it, there is nothing going to ever compare to the actual stars, but Brolin and Clayburgh pull it off. The supporting cast includes the always wonderful Red Buttons, Allen Garfield, and a very young Melanie Mayron (remember Melissa from 'Thirtysomething'?) Grab some popcorn and sit back, you are sure to enjoy this!",1470873600,,1134,4.374407582938389

1988559,2,B0001CNRA2,"Two fairly good actors and one bad script. Don't waste your popcorn or time. It was over-the-top at times and under the dirt at other occasions. Brolin looked a lot like Gable and did ok but only OK. Clayburgh was not pretty enough or funny enough. None of it was worth my time. I stuck it out and will advise you not too.

1988561,1,B0001CNRA2,"Terrible movie!  I found this at a used DVD store and viewed it tonight.  Aside from dozing through the last half of the picture, anyone who knows the real story of Gable and Lombard, will find this film a disgrace to both of their legacies.  It is inaccurate and the performances by the leads are laughable.  Clayburgh isn't so bad but James Brolin as Gable is very distracting with his squints, his winks, his snarl, and his teeth chattering.  A horrible performance.  The script is poor with nothing but a few slapstick antics thrown in for good measure to liven up the boring proceedings.  A total disaster.",1452988800,,611,4.654205607476635

1988595,5,B0001CNRA2,"This is a film I think very few people have seen. It is Jill Clayburg at her best. She is the only reason to see this film and she really worth watching.
James Brolin looks good but I think he tried too hard to impersonate Gable that his acting didn't come through enough, but she did make you forget that. The next film I watched was Unmarried woman with Jill Clayburg and Alan Bates. This is a film that every married or getting married woman should see. It's a classic. The four gals that play Jill's best friends and meet once a week, were the inspiration I think for Sex And The City. Watch both of these movies..........men should watch Unmarried woman, they can relate to the husband and the lover.....",1447977600,2,709,4.419847328244275

1988708,2,B0001CNRA2,"There are some pretty varied reviews here, and some folks really enjoyed this---(!)I was a fan of ""Golden-age Hollywood"" bio's and like most of us,really enjoyed the Harding book detailing the lives and careers of Gable and Lombard.  As is true with the majority of stars, they were less than virtuous when it came to fidelity in their personal lives, but it was general knowledge that they really loved each other. When these two tornadoes merged, it was the stuff of movie legend and--one would think--the basis for a really interesting film bio. I ran to see it when it was released....and while one expects some liberties and inaccuracies here and there, what I saw was very disappointing.  Despite the glowing comments found in some reviews, the story is--as many other reviewers noted--so fictionalized that it may as well have not have been made at all.  Brolin is just playing a part here, but does the best he could with the lead role. There were really no other major stars at the time who could have gotten away with playing Gable. Carole Lombard was even more unique: a mix of beauty, brains and energy who could switch from randy-mouthed screwball tomboy to elegant,sophisticated lady in a heartbeat. As undeniably talented as Jill Clayburgh is, she will not convince you in this role if you have ever been even remotely familiar with Lombard's performances. The plot is inaccurate and tacky, and the dialogue often foolish.  The makers apparently didn't learn from the lesson set by such turkey-predecessors as 1965's ""Harlow"" with Carroll Baker---another promising story that was completely twisted because the real story was hidden by all the glossy fiction.  What a waste.....but the music soundtrack is pretty nice, so it isn't a total loss--",1380758400,,1760,4.9727891156462585
1988709,5,B0001CNRA2,"Many biographical movies miss the mark by showing only superficial glimpses of the characters. Not this one,.James Brolin is Clark Gable equalled by Jill Clayburgh as a madly-in-love Carol Lombard. These two actors are the difference. You get the feeling that Gable and Lombard were somehow there during filming. And the perfect grimaces of Brolin as Gable !!!!!!!If you want a 1930's and 40's glimpse of Hollywood and these it's two icons-check it out.",1378512000,,453,5.135135135135135

1988711,1,B0001CNRA2,"This movie is based on the well-researched book, ""Gable and Lombard"" by Warren Harris.  Get the book at your library, you'll know and understand Gable and Lombard far better than you ever will by watching this wretched film.  Brolin, a decent enough journeyman actor, chooses to do this weird  ""gable shtick"" imitation.  It's wink, wink, nudge, nudge performance that's embarrassing to watch.  And poor Jill Clayburgh, another decent actress,  is just seriously miscast with  none of the fun, wit, or sex appeal of the actual Carole Lombard.  It would truly be a shame if someone saw this film and thought this was an accurate representation of these two great golden age stars.

These are reasons alone not to watch, but layered on to that is the bizarre choice by screen writer Barry Sandler to take the interesting truth about two people with complicated and fascinating lives, and jazz it up with a boat load of completely unnecessary fiction.  (but then again this IS the guy who wrote such cinematic national treasures as the other side of midnight, evil under the sun, evil never dies, and crimes of passion...so actually maybe that does make sense...)

 I'm a huge movie fan, hence why I love both Gable and Lombard, but in this case, if you want to know something about Gable, Lombard and the times in which they lived, do yourself a favor and read the book instead.",1375056000,2,1375,4.779661016949152

1988741,1,B0001CNRA2,"The show biz-insider movie is hardly the most distinguished of film genres; at the most entertaining, they're generally well-made soap operas that happen to be set in the entertainment industry (e.g., A Star is Born, The Bad and the Beautiful, etc); I don't know of one that is a completely successful representation of the business as it has ever actually functioned. All About Eve is, I will say, my favorite movie (which is not at all the same as saying I think it's the BEST movie), but its depiction of the theater world is plainly fake even to someone who's never lived or worked in it; nobody ever schemed her way from complete nobody to becoming a Broadway star whose ""name resounds througout the nation"" in a matter of mere months, as Eve Harrington does without ever breaking a sweat. It seems odd that people who, after all, work in the very industry they're depicting can't or won't give us a realistic view of their own profession; I think the answer is that they probably could, but think the public would find reality dull, and so they make these movies to conform to the image of show business people get from fan magazines and celebrity websites.

Since it was first released in the '70's I have had a special revulsion for ""Gable and Lombard"". This must be at least partly because, just before I saw it, I had read a fine, well-researched biography of Clark Gable, which had a very touching account of his relationship with Carole Lombard. When I heard that a movie had been made about the subject, I very much looked forward to seeing it; of all the 'true life' Hollywood stories I'd read, this one seemed the one most suited for the screen. The bare facts, alone and without embellishment, are so perfectly right they seem already scripted; the time span is relatively compact, there is a definite beginning, middle and (cinematically tragic) ending, with lots of entertaining anecdotes and verified incidents of drama, comedy and romance. How could it go wrong--the thing would practically write itself!

Well, it went wrong because the filmmakers clearly couldn't see a good story if it bit them in their most sensitive area, and proceeded to distort and rearrange the facts in ways that were not only dishonest (one expects some of that), but were also stupefyingly LESS entertaining, dramatic, moving, etc than the simple truth. There are way too many examples of this to recount, but to take just one--a rather minor one, but extremely irritating because it is so inexplicable: why is Gable shown as having enlisted in the military while Lombard is alive, when in fact he signed up in the wake of her death? Any student of Screenwriting 1A would see that the truth is plainly more moving and effective; the only rationale I can think of is they wanted to make Gable more like one of his movie roles; manly and determined, someone who goes to war because of his own heroic character, whereas doing it out of grief might seem weak and unpatriotic.

The difficulties for Gable in settling his divorce with his second wife are also misplayed, with a false, corny and unfunny spectacle of the lengths he and Lombard go through to hide their romance to avert a career-killing 'scandal' (actually, Gable and Lombard were quite openly a couple while he was separated but not yet divorced), and for dramatic climax we get a cooked-up and tiresomely bloated misrepresentation of an actual paternity suit brought against Gable, which in reality caused him only momentary discomfort, but in the film threatens (quite unconvincingly) to end his career--as if Louis B. Mayer would be unable or unwilling to avert that danger to MGM's biggest moneymaker!

The stars are good enough in the title roles, the dialogue is ghastly, the look of the film is lavish but always seems like a movie set; but again, the central, insurmountable killer is that the people who made this flop didn't see what they had in the actual story of Gable and Lombard, and proceeded to recklessly and mindlessly vandalize and rip to shreds one of Hollywood history's rare authentic love stories, and all because they thought they could make fiction that was better than reality. Wasn't there anyone around to tell them they couldn't?",1350777600,11,4218,4.797799174690509

1988753,3,B0001CNRA2,"I agree with several reviewers that Jill Clayburgh's portrayal gets too involved in vulgarities and not enough in the subtleties of her character.  Going from a snarling foe of Gable to his sweetheart is a transition that lacks credibility.  The end of the movie has history all messed up.  ""Carole"" tells ""Clark"" at their ranch that Corregidor has just fallen and MacArthur left the Phillippines.  Actually the first event happened May 6, 1942 and the second March 11, while Lombard died on January 16.  The ""I'm going on a bond-selling tour"" conversation would have taken place in early January; actually, Gable urged his wife to do so because he was committed to a picture.  The end scene takes place in the desert under a tent, with Gable already in uniform.  He was actually in a saloon where he was hold up waiting for word of his wife's fate, and he only joined the military afterwards out of a feeling of guilt for her death.

Lombard was a remarkable person in her own right and it would be difficult for any artist to try to portray her in a way that does justice to her legacy.",1288569600,5,1088,4.543589743589743

When I saw it for sale at Amazon for a good price, I decided to buy it. It's pretty much what I expected. James Brolin has the almost impossible job of portraying a man who was beyond a legend. Though he bears a good general resemblance to The King, his attempts to imitate Gables speech and manerisims make him come off like a nite-club impressionist. Clayburgh's portrait of Lombard is a bit more relaxed, but she seems to be chanelling a lot of Barbra Striesand in her performance.

Historical acuracy is cast aside for dramatics sake. In the opening scene when Gable arrives at the crash site to await word on his wifes fate, he's a captain in the army. In truth, Gable did not join the service until after Carole died.

The film has the feel of a 70s TV movie, but all in all, it's entertaining.
I felt a bit of sadness while watching it, as my late mother was such a fan of Clark Gable. She always wanted to see this film. She died before I could locate it.",1253664000,2,1125,4.252336448598131

1988757,2,B0001CNRA2,"First half good, second half not so good. I think Brolin was terrific as Gable. I think he nailed the character. Clayburgh was good as well. As I said, it was quite enjoyable for an hour, then it just lost control of its story and its charm. Too bad. The actor who played L. B. Mayer was great. He had all the best lines.",1203379200,,321,4.03125
1988758,4,B0001CNRA2,"The critical lambasting this film received on it's initial release in 1976 is inexplicable.  Though certainly not a classic love story it is most definitely above average.  The film's only failing that I can see are some slapstick moments that fall flat.  Where it succeeds is in the scenes of intimacy between Gable and Lombard.  James Brolin is more than adequate as Clark Gable and Jill Clayburgh is absolutely radiant as Carole Lombard.  The chemistry between the two is palpable which makes the relationship believable.  At times I lost sight of the fact that these were two of the most famous celebrities in America and that they were ordinary people in love.  The film also contains a terrific turn by one of my favorite character actors, Allen Garfield, as Louis B. Mayer.  Now if only they would release on DVD another Hollywood bio released in 1976, ""W.C. Fields and Me"", with Rod Steiger.  Trivia note:  Clayburgh hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" at the time of this film's release and took part in a parody of the film, ""Grable and Lombard"".",1150329600,4,1049,4.810055865921788
1988759,3,B0001CNRA2,"This is a really enjoyable film to watch but it contains many inaccuracies. Lombard comes across as a foul mouthed, ill educated woman when she was the opposite. Lombard was very much a thinking woman who was a devout New Deal Democrat who earned the admiration for FDR and Eleanor. Duesenberg driving Gable (He owned 4!) although a gifted actor was never a Hollywood intellect like Lombard, Frederic March, Edward G. Robinson and other activist actors of the day. Many people hated James Brolin in this film but I think in 1976 he was the best choice. I did not like Clayburgh as Lombard. I am shocked that Hollywood has not made a real epic movie about the couple. This 1976 TV movie and a French Documentary seem the only information on this iconic couple of Hollywood's golden era. This may be due to the fact after Lombard's death Gable never spoke publicly about his late wife except one time in 1943 when he along with Lombard's brothers and Louis B. Mayer went to christen the Liberty Ship ""Carole Lombard"".",1129075200,3,1015,4.644444444444445
1988760,1,B0001CNRA2,"Total fiction, and that's too bad, as it was a story worthy of telling.  Badly miscast, Lombard comes off as a shrill, foul-mouthed (while she had the vocabulary of a sailor, Gable once said ""it was music coming from her."")shallow wench and Gable is portrayed as a dimwit.  Neither is true - Lombard was a warm, caring, giving woman and Gable had more than a veneer of sophistication.  The film invents situations, or warps real ones out of recognition, never touching on Gable's infidelities, which were so painful to Lombard - in fact, to draw a simple circle around a very complex issue, Lombard died because Gable couldn't keep his pants zipped, and the film doesn't touch on that at all.  To its credit, it does try to capture the essence of their love story, but it didn't have to invent, distort, and mutilate ""The Great Legend"" of Hollywood love stories.",1106265600,9,862,4.688741721854305
1988761,5,B0001CNRA2,"This 70's movie was lost and now has returned to Anamorphic (automatically adjusts to TV size)WideScreen 16:9 DVD!!!  There are no extra features with this DVD.
The Golden Years of Hollywood (1930 - 1960) had the great love stories on and off the silver screen.  There was Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Bacall and Burton and Taylor but none of these were as hot, steamy and as controversal as ""Gable and Lombard"".  Hollywood through their eyes tries to capture this passion with a comedy/drama of the wildest exaggerations.  Even so the love story cannot be denied.
It was the 1930's and Clark Gable was known as the ""King"" and Carole Lombard was the highest paid actress and known as the ""Queen"" of the screwball comedy (or the black comedy - a bizarre style of comedy that evolved from the Depression.  Taking a negative situation and making it into an ironic humorous story).  James Brolin as Gable and Jill Clayburgh as Lombard do an exceptional job bringing these two dynamic superstars to the big WideScreen.  Lombard was a real blonde beauty, talented, single, very defensive, could not make romantic/marraige commitments, a tomboy, drank, smoked cigars and a party animal.  Gable was handsome, talented, mans man, had married older domineering women and a wild partying womanizer.
This movie although very fictionalized captures the essence of ""THE GREATEST HOLLYWOOD ROMANCE"".  Gable and Lombard fell hard for each other and Gables wife would not grant him a divorce.  (She loved the prestige of being Mrs. Clark Gable).  This movie has us journey the long road that Gable & Lombard spent trying to make that utilmate commitment, marriage.  Finally through public (who loved these two), Hollywood moguls and legal pressure Clark Gable and Carole Lombard were married.  This true Hollywood romance only lasted for less than 3 years when Lombard was tragically killed in an airplane crash returning from a World War II bond drive in her home state of Indiana.  Gable never got over her death.
This is a must see movie. Watch this fun loving torrid romance a true Hollywood fairy tale.  Enjoy.",1082937600,14,2099,4.957142857142857
