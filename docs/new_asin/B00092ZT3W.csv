8056854,5,B00092ZT3W,"I grew up with Danny & The Dinosaur and now my son gets to grow up with this story and many others too. He frequently goes to the DVD player and puts the disk in ""all by myself!"" so that he can watch it - over and over and over again. We never get tired of it because the music and stories are lots of fun.",1219708800,,306,3.6515151515151514
8056855,5,B00092ZT3W,"I borrowed this DVD from the library because my 4 year old son is named Danny and he loves dinosaurs.  He has watched it continuously for the past few days, and now I find I'd better buy it.  The title story isn't his favorite, though.  He loves the Island of the Scog, which is a cute little story with a surprise ending.  He also enjoys Stanley and the Dinosaur, which I find quite frightening, with scary-looking cavemen and a scary-sounding narrator.  But it has a good message.",1156204800,5,482,4.494252873563219
