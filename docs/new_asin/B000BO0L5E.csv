2430809,3,B000BO0L5E,"Urban Gothic was a two season horror anthology broadcast on ITC (British TV) in 2000 and 2001. This dvd set contains the 13 episodes from the first season.

Broadly speaking, Urban Gothic can be seen as a kind of modern Hammer House of Horror (one episode even features an Ingrid Pitt cameo), albeit more graphic than that venerable series. Some episodes scream tribute - ""Old Nick"" could easily pass for a ""lost"" Hammer offering. Others episodes are modern, even trendy - ""Vampirology"" features a documentary film crew following around a narcissistic hedonist who may/may not be a vampire.

Urban Gothic is neither the greatest TV, nor the worst. It suffers from some of the typical defects of the anthology series: uneven acting, directing, and scripting. Some episodes stand out, others barely stand up. But even the legendary Twilight Zone suffered this illness; anyone who denies it has never seen the budget-cutting ""live TV"" episodes. On the upside, with a run time of well under 30 minutes, weak episodes quickly pass away.

Fans of Hammer-style horror and anthology horror will likely enjoy this set.

8089793,1,B000BO0L5E,What a letdown.  I was expecting great things from this series.  It's more geared towards young or new horror fans.  There's nothing new here and the acting is like a grade school play.  There's nothing special about the special effects and the script is what ignited my disfavor for this bomb.  Stick with the classic shows like Tales from the Crypt and you'll be much better off.  Don't waste a dime.  Avoid!  Avoid!  Avoid!,1399939200,,426,4.648648648648648
8089794,1,B000BO0L5E,"Urban Gothic review for season 1 and 2
Do not waste your money on this series!!!! Bad- Casting, Acting, Sets, Plots- Everything!
Both seasons 1&2 look like they were done as an overdue class assignment with no budget or plan.
This is not quality stuff!",1294099200,,252,4.622222222222222
8089795,4,B000BO0L5E,"I found this show by accident and was pretty damned impressed. The video format makes it look low-budget but they tell the stories very well; there are a few lousy stories but the good ones make up for it...""Be Movie"", ""Eater"", ""Boy's Club"", ""The One Where"", ""Ritual Slaughter"" are really cool shorts. I'd get both seasons to cover all the bases.",1233100800,,346,4.688524590163935
8089796,3,B000BO0L5E,"There are a number of stories bundled here, 13, with the last cleverly titled Thirteen.. and most of the time they held my attention. I found some were certainly better than others, Vampirology was my favorite, with it's quirky documentary interview with the modern day vampire. Then there were tales that came across a bit silly, like Deptford voodoo.

The rendering to DVD for the US market has that hazy quality that some times shows up in PAL to NTSC transfer, but this could be compression too as there is 6hrs of footage crammed onto 2 discs.

Overall I'd say it is entertaining and offers value for money but buy it used.. you get what you pay for and if you can pay about 7$ I'd say that's good.",1214179200,,703,4.441860465116279

8089798,5,B000BO0L5E,"Wow!

What a brilliant DVD I got here. Had not seen any of these gems anywhere before so bought it sight unseen and was not dissapointed.

The first episode alone is worth the price and the second one is amazing as well.

Finally, intellegent, gruesome, gory, scary, everything a horror fan could want, and at an extremely cheap price.

British horror at it's best, put's the likes of ""supernatural"" to shame.

Now this is horror!",1192579200,2,430,4.68
8089799,5,B000BO0L5E,"Well where do I begin?  If you like BBC television your getting warmer.  How about over the top for anything you have ever seen for television (not HBO, Showtime or Cinemax), I'm talking about television.  This is seriously amazing!  Kinda like US version of Supernaturals, but way more BBC feeling.  Underground feeling, or dark and chilling!  I really urge everyone to stop reading this review and purchase this series!  Series 2 is available on Sept. 25th and today is Sept. 22nd (3 more days and I will be purchasing the 2nd series).  I can't wait and I can only wonder how good the 2nd series is going to be (the first series left me speechless).  This season contains all 13 episodes (and at this price it is a crime that everyone doesn't already own this DVD), of the cult classic television series that never aired in the US and is available for the first time in the US.

Behind the facade of London's shiny dockside developments, its designer boutiques and coffee bars lie forgotten dark corners and darker secrets.  It's a city where anything can happen (and happen it does).  From Vampire documentaries to alien-infested supermarkets.  From teenage necromancy to ghostly East End gangsters.  You'll find tales of the city to chill the blood in Urban Gothic.

Urban Gothic is a series of 1/2 hour contemporary Urban Horror tales.  Lean, sexy, fast and furious.  Slick, funny, and always scary.  It's dragging British horror kicking and screaming out of the museum and back to the city.
