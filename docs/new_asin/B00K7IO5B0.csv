8656547,4,B00K7IO5B0,"A former gangster, loses his daughter and while trying to work it out, creates a gangster war and then...

I thought the story was passable, and the surprise ending made the movie. The characters were not particularly interesting.

The acting was reasonable. Nicolas Cage did a good job.

If you last to the end of the movie, which is hard as its gets a bit tedious I think you will find it an enjoyable view.",1405900800,,409,4.426666666666667
8656548,2,B00K7IO5B0,"Paul Maguire (Nicolas Cage) is a former criminal, now a doting father of a teenage daughter Caitlin (Aubrey Peeples). One day his peaceful life is shattered by three masked men invading his house and abducting his daughter. Believing this has something to do with his own past, Paul and his former buddies Kane (Max Ryan) and Danny (Michael McGrady) set out to investigate the terrible event on their own.

I don't care if the story looks a bit like that of Taken. Tokarev starts out promisingly with Cage as a vengeful father, but suddenly the films story stops moving forward. In short, the films mid-part that deals with our heros investigation is simply dull, with action sequences that are poorly edited.

Rachel Nichols is Pauls wife Vanessa; Peter Stormare is his former gangster boss; and Danny Glover is Detective St. John, who knows Pauls past very well. None of them seems interested in the film they are in, and neither is Cage giving one of his worst performances.

In its final fifteen minutes Tokarev trying to wrap things up neatly takes an unexpected turn. This is not a bad move, but too late, making the entire storyline look even more ridiculous. Very disappointing.",1402531200,,1186,4.832512315270936
8656549,2,B00K7IO5B0,"Pauli (Nicolas Cage) is a former gangster who has gone straight and keeps Grecian Formula 14 in business. His daughter (Aubrey Peeples) goes missing and is later found dead. She was killed by a Russian Tokarev.  In an attempt to find the killer the retired Pauli and two friends turn the town upside down,  causing havoc to the Russian mafia.

Danny Glover has a small role as the policeman investigating the case. Rachel Nichols plays the part of his young second wife who loves the daughter as her own.

The location appears to be a small city, one where you wouldn't expect such a heavy influence of Russian mafia. There are numerous flashbacks to an event they believe is somehow connected to the present. The film had scenes that worked well, but the overall plot felt uneven, with an ending that made me feel I wasted my time watching the film.

Will have  camp value second time through knowing the ending.",1399507200,3,913,4.6397515527950315
