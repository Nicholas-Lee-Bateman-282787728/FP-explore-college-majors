4009861,2,B002XTBEDI,"I loved the original ""Cranford"" on Masterpiece Theatre and have read the book ""The Cranford Chronicles"" (which you should all read!).  I have the dvd and have watched it often and find something new in it each time.  The story ends with many story lines tied up but also, some options for future story lines as the characters age and grow.  Brilliant story and cast.  Then comes ""Return to Cranford"".  I won't spoil the story for you but while beautiful to look at, the story is shallow and meaningless and except for a few moments, you really won't care (everyone is against the railroad but no one has ever RIDDEN a train, soooooo).  Most of the original actors are there but it seemed to me it was done out of pity for those of us who loved the original and wouldn't want to see new people in these roles or (horrors!) for the money.  Stick to the original and imagine the future.",1263340800,22,883,4.41358024691358
4009862,3,B002XTBEDI,"Beware!  SOME SPOILERS!

Since Z. Hayes did an excellent job reviewing the general content of the film, I won't go over it again and I'm writing this review from the viewpoint that you, whom is reading this, have already seen the first Cranford.  This continuation does leave you wanting but not in a good way.  The film seems unfinished with a bunch of half attempts to cover potential plotholes (unless there is plan to make another continuation after ""Return to Cranford"" with further explanation as to what happens--if that's the case, I take back those last two sentences).

While the original Cranford seemed to be light and fun, in spite of life's obvious tragedies, this film is far more dismal.  Some of the story, rather than building up anticipation for what's going to happen next seemed as if it were there as time filler.  Also there were way too many parts that were just plain cheesy.  Case in point, Mattie is awaiting her friends at the train station.  She has urged them to try out the train in view of the town's attempt at progression and modernization that has been a huge concern for our heroines.  No one has arrived.  The train pulls up and comes to a halt while smoke emerges from underneath the train and out of nowhere Matttie's four friends emerges from the smoke arm in arm.  LOL!

What really saved Part 1 of this set is the appearance of Septimus, Lady Ludlow's long-awaited son, and his dealings with Harry Gregson, the beneficiary of Mr. Carter's estate.  Other than this, there's not much meat to the other storylines.  Of course, there is the inevitable love story (which is always a good thing) but still even that was predictable and not that all convincing.

The beginning of Part 2 is much better with the discovery and agony of forbidden love affairs, a broken engagement, a defying of social expectations, and some of the fun gossipy deliciousness of the first Cranford but it starts get corny again towards the end.

I hate somewhat comparing the two Cranfords but I'm sure that my being hopelessly prejudiced by the first (LOVED IT!!) dashed the high hopes to the second.  For me, the movie was just ok.",1263254400,5,2147,4.68
4009863,1,B002XTBEDI,"The original BBC TV production of ""Cranford,"" based on the book by E Gaskell, is charm itself. This later production is not based on any work by Gaskell and was created from thin air and that's about what it is worth. It is so poorly written that it ruins the memory of the original series. By all means, get the original ""Cranford,"" but avoid this ersatz aberration altogether!",1263168000,19,378,4.573529411764706
4009864,3,B002XTBEDI,"I only saw the first presentation on PBS and I am disappointed.  I loved ""Cranford"" and I wish that many more of the original cast were kept in the ""Return.""  Why was it necessary to lose Dr. Harrison and his new bride and leave Cranford with no doctor at all (hence the death of Martha).  A different actor for Matty's brother - Mary Smith's lack of eye glasses - and so many references to things past we must read all the books for answers.  What was Mary Smith's disappointment?  Hopefully, Septimus will not win out in the end.

But, I have pre-ordered the DVD and I am sure I will perhaps learn to like it.",1263168000,7,611,4.269565217391304
4009865,5,B002XTBEDI,"I was able to watch this follow-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cranford/dp/B00140PK6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cranford</a>&nbsp;thanks to a particular website and I promptly pre-ordered the DVD as I loved ""Cranford"" and its host of interesting and eccentric characters (and yes, I am a period drama fan, especially of BBC productions). This is actually a 2-part special that is not only inspired by the original Cranford, but also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. ""The Moorland Cottage"", and also ""The Cage at Cranford"", see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Tales-of-Cranford-Cranford-The-Cage-at-Cranford-and-The-Moorland-Cottage/dp/1434473589/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage</a>. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton),  Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).

The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.

The second part is set later in the year 1844, October  up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford. The magic of the original is still evident and this follow-up (of sorts - it's not strictly a sequel though some story arcs from the first Cranford get developed here) is still charming and engrossing. A fair note of warning, this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization,etc., but there's also romance, lighthearted moments and even a bit of magic! The comic and the tragic are seamlessly blended into the story, resulting in an immensely satisfying viewing experience. I loved it though I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly. I wish I could be so lucky as to live in a place like Cranford!",1262390400,192,4505,5.468390804597701

4009928,4,B002XTBEDI,"As with Season 1, another high quality movie. This short series, and being British, says it all. The writing is intelligent, as are the character portrayals, of quality, humor and with a sense of expectation of what a small town people, and especially 2 sisters, might have experienced in daily life, with high and low differences, and the coming of the industrial revolution and change to their small, unchanged, town.

I found some of the expressions and attitudes, that I have either heard about as human experience or read about, seemingly possible and others hilarious. Of course, there are the separation of classes and respectabilities that exist, still, although not so obvious and obvious. If life then wasn't exactly as portrayed in this series, I still think it mirrors life in all small towns to some degree, even now.
This was a very enjoyable series and I recommend it strongly for its sheer various portrayal qualities.",1502323200,,934,4.987179487179487

4009999,5,B002XTBEDI,"I do so love this series, as I do and did most other BBC dramas. The plot moves quickly, but not so that you lose track of the action after one conversation--there is the perfect amount of time to absorb what happens, and an appropriate amount of suspense (none so much that you become anxious, but from time to time I was rather involved). Season one was a fitting companion, and although this series can stand alone, I feel it makes much more sense and a more enjoyable experience with the first season's progression in mind (it's free for prime members at the moment, so do take advantage). As always, Dench is fabulous. I don't recommend watching this directly after viewing her Macbeth performance, as that's all I could think about for a little while after attending my theatre capstone class lectures, but ugh these characters are so lovable and dynamic and wonderful. I hope you enjoy the series as much as I!",1487980800,4,917,4.631901840490798

Back in the day where women had to marry to have any chance to survive socially and to eat. Dowments were the upper classes means to success.
Cranford was a small town where everyone knew everyone business. The town was battling the new transportation Era, the train.  This was going to make this little town become closer to the rest of the world. Much like social media today.

They were not satisfied with just living properly but also found their own satisfaction and fulfillment.  Warmed my heart and challenged my mind as well.",1461715200,,436,5.477611940298507
4010495,4,B002XTBEDI,"I truly enjoyed Cranford, so I had no problem purchasing season 2. To me, it's all about the characters and watching some of the UK's most famous, prolific and popular actors showing up (I do wish Martin Shaw as Miss Matty's brother, who appeared in the last episode of Cranford could have returned) and mixing and mingling.

I'm not sure as a woman of the 21st century that I could abide with the role women were delegated to in Cranford (nor so many of the seemingly silly and irrelevant ""customs"", but I would enjoy more courtly behavior exhibited by men of all ages. Good manners seemed to be very important and people just seemed to be nicer on so many levels, even if there was, of course, all the gossiping.

If you loved Cranford, you'll want to see the followup three episodes.

Like life, it has its ups and downs and your heart does go out for some of the characters and the challenges they face.

I would never want to live in those times, but it's great to visit with these wonderful, engaging and loveable characters.",1461542400,,1031,4.497326203208556
4010496,5,B002XTBEDI,I didn't like this season as well as the first...for all the reasons that people have stated before. But I still loved it!,1461456000,,122,4.3478260869565215
4010497,5,B002XTBEDI,"If anyone had truly been paying attention, they would have noticed that we British call it a 'Railway' not a 'Railroad'. When nit-picking over fine details, at least get the language right.

Minor irritations aside, I began watching the first series of 'Cranford' yesterday, and was so captivated by it, having watched each episode back to back, that I watched the three episodes of the second season today. I'm only sorry that more were not made. An absolutely fabulous tale, beautifully filmed, and wonderfully cast with some of the U.K.'s best and most beloved actors.
If you want a full review, then cast your eyes upwards to other people's worthy write-ups. However, I suggest you watch for yourself, escape for a while and discover a little gem. Very funny, often very moving. It's just a pure delight.",1461110400,2,808,4.897810218978102

4010530,5,B002XTBEDI,"This starts slow and I thought it was going to be a sleeper...Well, it was. A sleeper in the sense that it slowly draws you in to the life of a group of mostly spinster women who seem to be buried in the gossip of village life. I was surprised at first that the wonderful and always watchable Judi Dench would be such a meek and hum-drum lady in this series. But of course, Miss Dench does not disappoint.
It's not Downton Abbey, but Cranford can draw you in and make you impatient to see how this little village is going to handle the next thing that comes.",1456876800,,558,4.175925925925926

4010535,5,B002XTBEDI,I was hooked within the first 2 minutes and loved it so much I then bought Return to Cranford.  Imelda Staunton and Judi Dench deliver performances of a lifetime and Jim Carter (Bates the butler on Downton Abbey) steals the show with his usual magic!  The characters are complex and fully developed to the point you love some and roll your eyes at others.  I have watched it so many times I need to buy a second just in case I wear it out!

I am so very pleased to see this Return to Cranford dvd and got it as soon as I heard about it.  Our story continues with our main characters who struggle with machinzation as it comes to Cranford in the form of a train and rail station.  The old ways are threatened and we wonder if the Cranford ladies will be up to the challenge of great change.
Costumes and authenticity are superb as always and the dialogue is fabulous.  You'll find yourself wrapped in up Cranford in no time at all.  This DVD is a keeper as well as the first in the series called Cranford.",1430179200,,684,4.354330708661418
4010578,5,B002XTBEDI,Judi Dench gives a great performance as always.  This tale gives the viewer a glimpse of how the class system in the UK impacted the lives of the average person.

4010683,5,B002XTBEDI,"The only issue with Cranford Seasons 1 and 2 is that there is not a Season 3 to curl up on the couch and immerse myself into this beautifully written story, brought to life by the cast of outstanding actors.  Yes, I know that Downton Abby is the shining star of all period dramas, but while waiting for the next season of Downton Abby to begin, Cranford and Dame Judi Dench as Miss Matty, was an enjoyable way to spend my evenings.",1414627200,,431,4.2560975609756095

4010818,4,B002XTBEDI,"Great costumes, sets, cinematography, script.  Spectacular casting and acting.  Wow.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the mere suggestion of the show sends my husband from the room!  This show has a definite feminine edge.  That said, my 12 year old son will sometimes get interested in it.  I think the appearance of the show's openings often do not do the show justice, making it appear overly romantic or a bit sappy, which it is not!  At any rate I've become a huge fan and even bought season 2, instead of waiting for it to come out on Amazon Prime!  Now...hurry with season 3, please.",1398729600,,608,4.513761467889908

4010825,5,B002XTBEDI,"Just so well done from the book. Judi Dench is just amazing in the series and so happy she decided  add another season to wrap up some of the stories.  These ladies rule, they outshine the few men they have in their village.  They overcome so many crisis and add humour in it.  The poor cat that ate the lace, the poor cow that had to wear pajamas the rest of it's life, until the train hit him that is...the poor doctor who had the joke played on him on Valentine's Day that just about ruined his life in the village....just too many to name including the deaths and marriages...life.

4010828,5,B002XTBEDI,"Gotta love 'em.  The series, gives such an interesting spin on spinsterhood.  I love that line, ""I have spinster carved in my bones, and I've never been sick a day in my life.""  Hilarious.

But really, for a woman of that era who did not care to die in childbirth, or to be lying-in every 10th month, I can kind of see where spinsterhood might be a preferred option.  Especially if one had as amiable a gaggle of geese as these to hang out with.  Miss Pole (that was ... and still is) is priceless.

I am enjoying this even more than Downton Abbey and Upstairs Downstairs, although both are fantastic.  I guess because there is some humor in it.  Kind of more like Vanity Fair in that way(the BBC version (wonderful!),not the Reese Witherspoon version(horrible!)).",1395705600,,764,4.5588235294117645

4010830,4,B002XTBEDI,Not quite sure what happened between seasons. Felt confused at first but really loved the story and acting. I would watch Judi Dench read silently and still be entertained I think.,1395705600,,180,4.838709677419355
4010831,5,B002XTBEDI,"Season 2 reveals a movement toward change, along with all the adventure, tragedy and joy that change encompasses. Matty becomes the most ardent change agent. Her influence, born of loss, emboldens friends and enemies to embrace new ideas and trends, while she herself grapples with the effect her encouragement has wrought. The series is thought provoking for those living in today's world where technology, politics, and social norms are in constant flux.",1395446400,,456,5.347222222222222

4010834,5,B002XTBEDI,"Love this as much as the first series. The best surprise is that Tim Curry shows up in these episodes. According to the commentary he was so enchanted by the first episodes, so he told his agent to make sure he made it into any future episodes. Love Crawford from top to bottom!

4010847,5,B002XTBEDI,Isn't he though? Tom was the reason I bought this movie.  I want to broaden my views of his acting abilities beyond Loki..He is far more than a pretty face..Will probably buy the first movie now..Rich in history..,1394409600,,213,4.605263157894737

4010850,5,B002XTBEDI,"I can't say enough about British drama.  They have it nailed.  Cranford, in my opinion, is a masterpiece of entertainment.  I have watched this DVD, so many times and have enjoyed the characters in their small community of Cranford.  Reminds me of the town in which I grew up, where all the neighbors knew what was going on in everyone's life, and gossiped, but not in a mean spirited way. The story centers around two spinsters sisters, Deborah (played by Eileen Atkins) and Mary (played by Judy Dench) in 1842.  The elder sister, Deborah, is the epitome of correctness. Her sister, Mary, is not so rigid in social correctness and a little softer in her demeanor. This is not to be missed............I recommend it, Highly.",1393804800,,724,4.76
4010851,5,B002XTBEDI,I know a lot of people are waiting for this to go on Prime - for free. My wife couldn't wait so we paid. It's probably worth it and you'll see another Downton Abbey star in this season. But for me it was very entertaining.,1393718400,,222,3.9555555555555557

4010856,5,B002XTBEDI,I also like the fact that it has some of my favorite actors like Tom Hiddlestone and Michelle Dockery {before she was Lady Mary on Downton Abbey}..and of course the great Judy Dench,1392595200,,181,4.515151515151516
4010857,4,B002XTBEDI,This was more of the same with Season One.  I would not recommend watching this season as a stand-alone.  You did need to see Season One to fully enjoy this season.,1392422400,,164,4.258064516129032

4010861,5,B002XTBEDI,"Cranford is about simple things, nothing really profound happens. In fact, some characters are not even developed at all (e.g. Sophie Hutton - she's pretty, and she's caring toward her younger siblings, and that's about all you learn about her - no personality development). But Cranford somehow manages to be rather enjoyable.",1391904000,,327,5.3076923076923075

4010871,5,B002XTBEDI,I absolutely loved this show & Cranford! Judi Dench & others where wonderful & so witty. This type of programming allows us Americans to know what it was like in late 19th century England. Thanks!,1389830400,,196,4.628571428571429

The tour guide said, ""Put Judy Dench in a Bonnet"" and the English public will always watch. Two Christmases later, we saw the series on Amazon and decided to watch. Later, we bought this Christmas Special-- originally titled ""A Cranford Christmas"", I believe. The series was good, but the special was even better.

4010876,5,B002XTBEDI,"Sentimental small town movie starring Judi Dench:  at first it was questionable seeing her play a mild-mannered sister, but after two episodes of her submissive role to her domineering sister, the sister is gone, then she becomes more palatable.  Still, quite a different role for Dame Dench.  The movie is sweet and charming. I enjoyed seeing the clothing and manners of a small English country town.  Later watched The Return to Cranford. It was made in 2009 and only two seasons were available.  I would like to have seen more, but maybe that was all that were made.",1389225600,,569,4.76530612244898
4010877,2,B002XTBEDI,"I adored Season 1 of Cranford, which was very charming with a rich array of characters. Judi Dench, as always, leant thoughtfulness, truth, and life to her performance and provided the perfect central force for the other inhabitants of Cranford to revolve around. However, Season 2 or ""Return to Cranford"" lacks any hint of the sparkle that made Season 1 so enjoyable. The new characters are neither interesting nor believable and there is a cruelness to the story lines that I did not appreciate. Watch the first season and call it a day.",1388966400,2,539,4.806451612903226
4010878,2,B002XTBEDI,I absolutely loved Cranford but this doesn't live up to the first one.  They must have changed writers for this one and it was not an improvement.  The actors were all still amazing but the story just wasn't there.  Tom Hiddleston was the highlight.,1388793600,,249,4.613636363636363
4010879,3,B002XTBEDI,"Have to agree with past reviewers that this one didn't live up to the first one, mostly because half of the characters didn't return and either no reasons were given or very poor, unbelievable ones. I bought this season for Tom Hiddleston and so for that, I got my money's worth but the first, free season had the better storylines by far!",1388707200,,339,4.483870967741935

We were pleased that it had very few bad words and few low dresses (just one or two where the neck line was a tad to low and one scene where the maid lay down inapropriatly) The second one was more interesting for us, fewer deaths of the people you liked, and even fewer bad words and kess inapropriat behavier. This part is a  SPOILER  for a small side part: we were disappointed however that they made Mary a bit of a feminism by braking off her engagement as an impediment  for her becoming a great authoress. But since she is not in the movie much and by the time you find out her choice you already care more for Peggy it is not to big of a deal.
 Modesty wise there is one part that is a little uncomfortable because of the way a man looks at a girl when he is asking if he might wipe the crumbs off of her skirt and the way he does it is very slow but that is all. tjere was on sort glimps of an inmodest picture in the third episod and in one episode Mary's stepmother is wearing an inmodest dress.",1382918400,3,1093,3.9771689497716896

4010920,5,B002XTBEDI,"This show is so great, I so wish they had more seasons. Anyway, the characters are well written and you are really taken by everyone of them. I find myself having emotions for all of them. I love shows that do this, I means isn't that why we watch to be taken away to another place even just for a little while.",1378598400,,311,4.032258064516129

4010923,5,B002XTBEDI,"After watching Cranford, I was disappointed as I thought that where the series ended.  I was so glad to have found Cranford: Return to Canford.  Great series!

4010926,5,B002XTBEDI,"After watching Cranford, I was delighted to find Return on Amazon.  I watched it twice, recommended it several times and will probably watch it again and again.  Next to Downton Abbey, its one of my favs.",1378080000,,204,4.638888888888889
4010927,3,B002XTBEDI,I didn't like that some people who were important in the original simply disappeared. I thought it was important to have them back in the sequel. I enjoyed watching the women in town trying to rule in all things at that time! It was a bit unrealistic but fun to watch. You should get ready for disappointment.,1377993600,,309,4.43859649122807

4010931,5,B002XTBEDI,"What can I say about a program that is written so well, acted by some of the FINEST British actresses (and actors!) - it is a trip back in time with a sly sense of humor and some cheeky good fun. I wish there were more of it...it's addictive!!",1376956800,,243,3.979591836734694
4010932,5,B002XTBEDI,"I enjoyed seeing what had happened in Cranford since the original DVD. Miss Mattie again came across as a caring person with a great dal of strength. The other ladies in the village still entertained. With a cast headed by Dame Judy Dench, how can you lose?  I will watch these DVDs again & again & I know I will enjoy them.",1376784000,,324,4.225806451612903
4010933,5,B002XTBEDI,"I love a story that moves me to tears. Cranford never fails to make me shed a tear of joy or feel nostalgic for another time and place. The story is fun, serious, complex, and simple. It proves that all things are possible in film.",1376265600,,231,4.155555555555556

4010944,5,B002XTBEDI,"Enjoyable story of a time and place no longer seen. A small town community interacts in all sorts of situations. It was worth it to me just to see the lace that places a part in one of the episodes. Entertaining and ultimately, a reaffirmation of life and the people who live it.",1374364800,,279,4.283018867924528

4010946,5,B002XTBEDI,You can't beat the ladies of Cranford for their combination of excentricity and kindness. The moral values of the era are reflected in the decisions the characters make when faced with adversity. An enjoyable journey!,1373846400,,217,5.228571428571429
4010951,5,B002XTBEDI,"There isn't anything new that I could say that hasn't already been said for decades about how brilliantly the BBC does period drama.  This is another fine example.  Drama, comedy, intrigue, romance, all rolled into one.  Good show!",1373587200,,231,5.026315789473684

4010958,5,B002XTBEDI,"This was also very good,The acting,costuming and set design were exceptional. I wish Amazon would purchase more series in the caliber. Lark rise and Cranford are two of my favorites. I look forward to more good series from Amazon.",1372377600,,230,4.923076923076923
4010959,1,B002XTBEDI,"I was very upset to find that this was only the sequel and not the first season as well.  Perhaps I didn't read the product info clearly, but the way it is PRESENTED gives the impression it is CRANFORD AND RETIRN TO CRANFORD.... Now I will have to pay double to get season one instead of the SET.  It should NOT be labeled CRANFORD  in big letters and then Return to Cranford, giving the impression it is BOTH.",1372291200,,410,4.230769230769231

4010961,5,B002XTBEDI,"""Return to Cranford"" reintroduces us to the main stable of Cranford characters, and brings several new cast members into the fold ... one things for certain ... given the ""quality"" of 19th Century healthcare, it is very easy to ""off"" any over-demanding characters (actor / actresses)!",1371945600,,284,5.195652173913044
4010962,5,B002XTBEDI,"Excellent performing and compact story lines. It is not trying to stretch out the story but pacted in.

4010963,5,B002XTBEDI,"I loved Cranford, and I loved Return to Cranford.  this period piece is set in the 1700 hundreds in a remote village called Cranford.  All the characters have very good parts and roles in their social circle.  You can't wait to the next episode, which is of course why I binge-watched the series...and then bought it.  I love Judi Dench, but there are no weak characters in this series.  And, it's family friendly.",1371686400,,414,4.616438356164384
4010964,4,B002XTBEDI,Good but not a feel good Jane Austin type of production.  Great acting but you never really fall in love with any of the characters.,1371600000,,132,4.28

4010968,5,B002XTBEDI,"It was a great movie as well as the first one.  The only negative about it is that I as a Prime member had to pay to watch, since I didn't have to for the first one.",1370390400,,165,3.4594594594594597
4010969,5,B002XTBEDI,"I was looking for something to put me in that perfect historical mood, something reminiscent of Austen and Bronte and this fit the bill.  Both the first episodes and this beautiful offering made me cry, laugh, and long for the happy ending it finally gave me.
Judi Dench is brilliant, but the rest of the cast is fantastic without exception.  When the credits rolled at the final scene all I could think is I wanted more.",1369785600,,421,4.526315789473684
4010970,5,B002XTBEDI,I truly enjoyed the story as well as each of the characters who are carefully delineated both by the writer and by the actresses who portray them and bring them to life.,1369526400,,169,4.3125
4010971,5,B002XTBEDI,"Love return to Cranford, but then I usually enjoy anything Judi Dench is in, she is such a terrific actress. It is also interesting to see the period of another time portrayed and contrast it to our present time.",1369440000,,212,4.461538461538462
4010972,5,B002XTBEDI,I wish this series could go on and on!  This was just as good as the first one and I hope they make another before Dame Dench passes on...,1368748800,,138,3.7586206896551726

4010979,4,B002XTBEDI,"I've watched ""Return to Cranford"" twice and enjoyed it very much, but not as much as the first. Most of the original characters are here and so the acting is sublime and the story engaging. There are, however, a few loose ends and moments that feel contrived. The streets are so clean that the town looks like a set designed by Disney, but the costumes are perfect and the love story is charming. The conflict between Harry and Septemus doesn't feel finished, and the death of Harry - No! He's Alive! - is unworthy of the series. Still, on the whole, worth seeing.",1365811200,,564,4.485436893203883
4010980,5,B002XTBEDI,The cast of this reads like a who's who. The acting was fabulous and the story while a little weak at points overall was excellent. It's so nice to watch something on tv that is concerned with quality and not shock value.,1365465600,,221,4.285714285714286
4011000,5,B002XTBEDI,"it was interesting to read all discussions... pros and cons... that the railroad brought.  Just like today, people do not always go along with changes in their own communities.",1365379200,,176,5.068965517241379

4011016,4,B002XTBEDI,"This series is probably the closest to ""real life"" at the time, with gossips, social expectations and unexpected deaths. Was really happy with the costumes and imagery, nothing was ""updated"" for modern tastes in a major way.  Excellent and entertaining, with some really top-notch actors!",1362700800,,288,5.4

4011042,5,B002XTBEDI,"Well, the ladies are back and they experience as enjoyable antics and lives as in the first Cranford.

With its splendid pedigree of actors retained, there is no lack of effort on their part but even the excellent cast cannot not fix a script/direction that is sorely lacking in most all aspects and one which renders every situation as contrived and insipid.

Don't get me wrong by the rating, Cranford is a charming miniseries with an excellent ensemble, and it's extremely humorous in more than a few instances. It's just that after hearing my mother rave about it for months, I expected something different when I finally sat down to watch it. Those interested in this series are likely to get what they're looking for, which makes it a worthwhile piece of entertainment for most, it's just not for me.",1353801600,,501,4.5777777777777775

Although the first one is good, Return to Cranford is even better with a more interesting storyline, characters, set designs, costumes, and performances. A huge fan of Dame Judy Dench, it's a joy to watch her in this series. She perfectly captures the sensibilities of a spinster in 1840s England, without being overly sentimental or unrealistic.

defective DVDs. As I do want to see this series very much, I purchased the DVD

returned these defective discs back to Amazon for refund.",1342828800,,620,4.4
4011080,5,B002XTBEDI,"With lots of material left over from the original ""Cranford"", it was always a given that we'd get to see more delightful stories from the rural Cheshire village and it's endearing inhabitants.  These two 90-minute episodes finally tie up the stories of Miss Matty, Harry, Miss Galindo, Lady Ludlow and Cranford's irrepressible ""Amazons"" Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn), and Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay).

It's been a year since the events of the last series of ""Cranford"", and much has changed in the community.  Dr Harrison and Sophy have left the district, and so have Jessie and Major Gordon.  Widower Mr Buxton (Jonathan Pryce), an old resident of Cranford, returns with his now-grown son William (Tom Hiddleston) and spirited ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery).  On the other side of the social divide is the lovely Peggy Bell (Jodie Whittaker).  Cranford's newest romance has a lot riding against it, though, with Buxton very vocal in his displeasure at Peggy eventually becoming William's wife.  Mrs Jamieson's sister-in-law Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) is another enchanting newcomer.

After closing down her enterprising parlour tea shop, Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench) has settled into the joyful role of being a second mother to Tilly, the little daughter of Martha and Jem (Claudie Blakley and Andrew Buchan), whilst her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) provides the necessary money to keep the Jenkyns household going.  To her joy, Miss Matty once again has an extended visit from Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), who reveals that she has firmly resolved to call an end to her engagement in order to set forth on a career as a novelist.

At Hanbury Court, Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) is dying, but still firmly clinging to her land, which is constantly threatened by the ever-encroaching railway.  Miss Galindo (Emma Fielding) finally manages to secure Lady Ludlow's son Lord Septimus (Rory Kinnear) to return during a brief trip from his villa at Lake Lugano, but Lady Ludlow passes away before he arrives.  When Septimus unravels the bleak financial condition of the estate and realises that he'll have to eventually pay back Lady Ludlow's mortgage into the inheritance of young Harry Gregson (Alex Etel), he attempts to manipulate the boy into accepting a smaller immediate payment in lieu of the larger amount owed, underestimating the powerful ally that Harry has in Miss Galindo, and her fervent quest to see Mr Carter's last wishes carried out.

The central dilemma in town remains the prospect of the railway ""invading"" the peace and calm of Cranford itself.  It's an argument which is pitting father against son, neighbour against neighbour, and driving away many valued workers, including Jem, who has become one of the local craftsmen drawn to the higher wages offered by the railroad company.  Despite her own fears and reservations, Miss Matty organises for her closest friends to experience rail travel first-hand, and unwittingly triggers a series of dramas with wide-reaching consequences for several Cranford residents...

As in the original CRANFORD miniseries, there is much to love and savour in this all-too-brief sequel.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas is one of my personal favourites and she is a great practitioner in the art of how to write for period drama.  She has a particular knack for immersing herself in the period and creating a true dialogue, with great feeling and affection for her characters, and quite frequently hilarious.  I know of no other costume drama writer who can write such brilliant comedy - and with the antics of Miss Pole, Mrs Forrester and Mrs Jamieson, Heidi Thomas is in her element.

The performances remain utterly delightful.  Only a top-drawer series like CRANFORD could attract the likes of Dame Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton, Julia McKenzie, Jonathan Pryce, Francesca Annis and Nicholas Le Prevost; in addition to bright young costume drama stars like Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"") and Matthew McNulty (""Lark Rise to Candleford""). It's like a Theatre Rep company from the good old days.

4011083,5,B002XTBEDI,"This is not really a sequel (though some story arcs from the original do get developed here), but a 2-part special that is inspired in part by Cranford, and also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. ""The Moorland Cottage"", and also ""The Cage at Cranford"", see Three Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).

The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.

The second part is set later in the year 1844, October up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford.

A fair note of warning - this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization, etc., but there's also romance and lighthearted moments. However, I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel. Personally, I loved the original Cranford and thought it was a superior production, and though I like RTC, the plot is not as engaging as the original. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly.",1329609600,9,3720,5.045528455284553

4011098,4,B002XTBEDI,"The first Cranford is a favorite in our home:  it has well drawn characters in deep and subtle situations that are fraught with emotion, with historical change, with personal development and hope.  It is one of the most beautiful mini-series I have ever seen, yet never gets precious or maudlin.  SO it was only a matter of time before we got this one.

On the one hand, there are many  strengths to this production.  The characters develop, some in very surprising yet believable ways, including tragedies, changes in plans, and unexpected love.  This is very fun and makes it much more than a simple follow-on.  The period atmosphere is also elegant and plush, vividly and accurately evoking a period in history - my kids had many questions about it.  On the other hand, the story feels rushed.  Not only is there too much going on too fast, but the viewer lacks the time to integrate it all.  That translates into a kind of overload and a complete lack of the meditative, almost poetic, pauses and asides that makes the first production a meal to savor.

As far as the plot goes, the train remains a controversial issue, with many complications and the need for continuing negotiations with owners and changes of attitude.  (This was one reason why train networks spread in the US much more swiftly.)  The son of the reigning aristocrat also returns too late, though after some brutal machinations he is whisked away all too quickly.  The wonderful boy who is charged with getting an education in order to create a school for the town also faces a significant and unexpected crisis.  Nonetheless, while most of the principal characters are there, the doctor no longer serves the town.  His loss is partially made up with a group of very good new characters, but again, it feels rushed.  One very interesting character is a Scottish aristocrat, who arrives in town to visit a relative - sparking a major fight - and astounds everyone with her decision to stay.  That is all I can say without giving away too much.

I would recommend this to fans of the first series.  It is very good, if not as perfectly outstanding as we had hoped.",1305590400,,2135,4.670241286863271

Return to Cranford inlcudes two episodes that pick up where Cranford left off.  There are major changes afoot when the people of Cranford are forced to deal with the possibilty of the railroad reaching their isolated, thuogh largely contented town.

Death and life continue to be the hallmarks of this story, as well as conniving characters, and characters who are entrenched in their views.

Can Cranford survive the coming of progress, represented by the railroad, or will it be forever lost?  You will have to watch in order to find out.

I found the acting, costuming, and story lines to be fantastic!  This set of tails is, probably 1/2 star dimmer than the ""Cranford"", but it still warrants 5 stars in my book.

4011126,4,B002XTBEDI,"It is hard to imagine anybody buying this DVD without having seen the original ""Cranford"" beforehand. And on that understanding, how one receives this sequel film is totally dependent on one's attitude towards the first. The original ""Cranford"" is a classic period English small town morality play. It is superbly performed by a galaxy of solid - even great - British actors who are all so relaxed and at home in their roles that it all seems totally real and convincing. Behaviour standards, class attitudes, subtleties of language depending who is addressing who, the sets, camera work and directing are all faultless. The transformation of Judy Dench, the awful impact of thoughtless gossip, the almost unbelievable naivete of some of the characters... it all adds up to a perfect little work of art. The sequel, Return to Cranford, is pretty well what you'd expect. The Dench character cannot transform again, the gossips are recognized and so you anticipate their effect, the hand is dealt from the same deck, but the trumps have already been played. In other words, it is much the same, but not quite as satisfying. There are a few new twists - nicely developed. The producers and screenplay writers work hard to get fresh dynamics into the mix, possible by the progress of the railway (approaching modernity and changing mores) and the actors all do as well as before although the stars from the first film seem at times just a little jaded, and it is possible to wonder why a few from the first weren't brought back - where did they go, and why? Having said that, note that I rated this with four stars - but I'd give the first film five.

I'm still working my way through the series, so this might be premature, but it's harder to be engaged with the younger, new members of the cast - especially Peggy.

Also slightly disturbing is the change in the established characters appearance - it's very slight, but the whole cast seems to have gone blonde all of a sudden (but kept their brown eyebrows)... a small detail, but it's distracting from the content :-)

4011143,4,B002XTBEDI,"I enjoyed ""Return to Cranford"" very much, more so after the second viewing.  During the first viewing I was a little distracted by thinking about ""what happened to so and so?"" Also, the two new families are introduced a bit too quickly and so I didn't fully get into their characters until the second time around.  Like the first Cranford, this second installment has humor, sadness, the testing of friendships, the struggle between the old and the new and a sweet romance between two young people.  At first it bothered me that Dr. Harrison wasn't around, but then I thought about it.  How many period films continue a love story after the marriage?  Also, a huge part of the story in the first Cranford was the misunderstanding of Dr. Harrison's affections, so once that was resolved and he and Sophie were married, his story was told.  I really didn't see him being the heroic younger doctor again in Return to Cranford.  That was done enough in the first installment and it wouldn't have been as compelling in the second one.  In Return to Cranford, I absolutely loved the touching romance between William and Peggy.  He was so handsome, kind and resolved, and she showed that she was wise and strong in spite of her social awkwardness.  A few things keep me from giving this piece a 5 star review.  Perhaps I'll understand it better after more viewings, but I couldn't figure out exactly what happened with Harry and the estate.  Did he lose his inheritance?  I thought this story line was confusing and lacking in resolution.  Also, why was Mary gone in the beginning?  I didn't fully understand where she was and I thought it was strange to bring her back just to have her leave again.  Also, Mattie is almost financially destitute in the first Cranford, yet in this one, she has been able to save up a fairly large amount of money.  Is this because her brother Peter has his own income and contributes to her support?  I wasn't sure.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, feeling it to be overly sentimental.  It seemed odd to me that characters who probably wouldn't even know how to dance (specifically Peggy and Harry) were dancing like old pros.  In spite of these minor irritations, Return to Cranford is definitely a movie I will keep and watch several more times in the future.",1265673600,6,2295,4.631188118811881

But, this is just one more example of a quickly thrown together (""lets capitalize on the success of the first with a sequel!"" thinking) and very, very disappointing ""return"". I wish I had never seen the sequel, and in fact, have completely forgotten the sequel and prefer my own imagination of how things turned out.

4011145,3,B002XTBEDI,"The original Cranford series was not devoid of painful moments, but there was a balance of joy and grief.  The sequel seems to overbalance on the grief side, with two major losses.  One seemed to sacrifice the storyline for excessive dramatic purpose, a loss from which I think the series could not easily recover.

There seemed to be many holes in this series compared to the former one. No explanation was given for why Cranford went from two doctors to none.  And so much of what went on seemed to make little sense, or the characters indulged in excessive acts for no good reason except to furnish dramatic content -- Lady Ludlow's final stand, Jem Hearn's decision, and Harry's inexplicable comings and goings.  Even the town, which should have been booming (even if the railroad was going to be a few miles rather than right at their doorstep) was supposedly in an economic tailspin. After all, Jem was run off his feet by his business even before the railroad came.

For those of us that paid attention and really took in the details of the first series, it's not so easy for us to swallow whole a hasty, ill conceived and ill justified second series.

OTOH, there's enough of Cranford in it to make it passable to good, if not the excellent rating the first series got.  Imelda Stanton  and her feathers alone is worth the watch.

I can only hope we get more Cranford in future, though I wish they would  do the first series  and its devoted viewers justice and take a little more care to make a more sensible storyline.",1264464000,85,1528,4.556776556776557
4011146,5,B002XTBEDI,"If you have read the book, then you may be more pleased with ""Return to Cranford"" than ""Cranford.""
I simply adore the book, and I read it whenever I want to visit the ladies at Cranford so that is usually once a year.  That leads me to say Cranford pt 1 was a disappointment because some of the best scenes from the book were omitted (but delightfully included in pt 2.) And even more frustrating; those scenes were replaced with characters and story lines from Elizabeth Gaskell's other books.
The day after ""Return to Cranford"" aired on PBS I was anxiously awaiting my mail delivery to see if it arrived and I watched it again as soon as I could get the wrapper off!!
All of the actors in this movie are superb, the writing is well done and this dvd deserves a place on your shelf next to ""Wives and Daughters,"" ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""The Way We Live Now.""",1264291200,,862,4.354037267080745
4011147,3,B002XTBEDI,"How do you follow an act like Cranford?  With another drama, brilliant in it's own right.  Not by trying to re-visit past triumphs, much as we long to do so. The proper successor to Cranford has yet to come along, in my opinion, and it probably won't be about Cranford, but ""Return to Cranford"" was great fun, nonetheless.

Return to Cranford  stumbles perhaps against the block of the--what happens after the story ends?--mentality that plagues most sequels. We do get to see what happens to most of our beloved characters, with the notable exception of young Dr. Harrison. He's only mentioned in passing as having a wife and not being there anymore, which is odd, since so much of the drama revolved around him in Cranford. In the sequel, most of the drama revolves around the railroad construction, halted by Lady Ludlow's refusal to sell her land. Through a series of circumstances, the construction goes through an ""on-again, off-again"" cycle that feels contrived, and then culminates in an action-packed railroad event that also, in retrospect, feels contrived. Perhaps the writers hadn't come up with a solid character-driven story before they were up against a deadline. As a result we get this circumstance-driven drama that depends upon our pre-existing knowledge of and affection for the characters to get our attention. Had this story been about unknown characters, I doubt it would have much real interest at all.

There is also a strange sense that Cranford is a set, rather than a town, in this sequel. It feels less populated, somehow, and the costumes and rooms less detailed.  Perhaps because of the way it was filmed? They must have reused the same costumes and sets as the original film, but this production does look subtly different. More like t.v. and less like cinema.

Mattie's brother, Peter, is played by a different actor, which is distracting. There was something so remarkable, sort of ethereal, about the first Peter's physical appearance that it's dissapointing to see him played by this different actor.  The character adds very little to the story here, other than comic antics, so it's puzzling why Peter was included, if the original actor was apparently unavailable, especially since others are so pointedly missing. In fact, I wondered if the producers did a roll-call of who would be available for filming before the writers got to work on the screenplay, some of the omissions are so arbitrary.

Lady Ludlow's son, the contemptible Septimus, appears onscreen finally and his story begins to develop, only to trail off. We never find out how his shenanigans turn out, despite the fact that they have a crucial bearing on the outcomes of several other characters.

None of this means that I consider ""Return to Cranford"" a dismal failure. Not at all. For one thing, look at what it must be compared to. What sequel wouldn't suffer by comparison? I expected some notching-down of the quality when I ordered it, and intended to enjoy visiting with these characters again, anyway. And I did enjoy it. Although I have to say that, hokey a plot twist as it was, if Harry Gregson hadn't fogged up that mirror, I was prepared to be VERY dissapointed in the writers at that point! Enough bumping off of great characters, already!

The actors, as always, were their superb selves.  The performances are as satisfying as they could be with that screenplay. Good enough, in fact, to distract from the lackluster story.

If you're expecting to relive ""Cranford"" in all it's glory, don't. If you're prepared to enjoy some very fine t.v.-grade writing and production values, and revel in spending time with the beloved ""Cranford"" dames, then by all means, get yourself a copy of ""Return to Cranford"".  I'm keeping mine.",1264291200,42,3743,4.939490445859873
4011148,5,B002XTBEDI,"If you're at all interested in this production, do ignore the detractors and purchase this without hesitation.  Admittedly it may not rival the original, but it is still a great pleasure.  Watching Dench, Staunton, and McKenzie together is akin to watching a master class in acting.  Yes, some narrative threads, as others have pointed out, begin and end too quickly, but just being in the company of Cransford's inhabitants again is wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed my three hours back in Cranford, and hope that the BBC sees fit to take me back again with another series of episodes.",1264204800,,585,4.938775510204081
4011149,2,B002XTBEDI,"I was thoroughly enchanted by the original Cranford and, therefore, filled with happy anticipation for the sequel.  What a disappointment it is:  ridiculous plot lines, poor writing, choppy pacing, sloppy editing.  It contains none of the substance or subtlety of the original and little of it's charm.  The actors are the only pleasure yet they are given precious little to do...a waste of some considerable talent.  While I can watch Cranford over and over (and have!), once was enough for the sequel.  I couldn't help but feel cheated, I'm sorry to say.",1264032000,18,556,4.989130434782608
4011150,3,B002XTBEDI,"This DVD is two more episodes which continue the original five episode series.  If you haven't watched the first series of episodes, or if you are unfamiliar with the Elizabeth Gaskell novel ""Cranford"", you will have a difficult time if you begin this series here.  It is assumed by the film makers that the viewer will be familiar with the characters and location and there is no attempt made to explain who characters are or their background or relationships to one another.

From a purely artistic standpoint I would not hesitate to rate these two episodes as 4 stars.  The attention to period details in location, props, costumes and make up are superb.  I also think that the acting was of a very high quality.

When it comes to the actual plot of the episodes I'm afraid my rating drops to 2 stars.  This series has evolved into a type of soap opera done in period costume.  All appearances of adhering to the style of characters and situations developed by Elizabeth Gaskell have been abandoned in favor of ""modern"" danger and drama.  The whole charm of the characters of Gaskell's ""Cranford"" is that they are so understated and yet survive so well within their own small sphere of life.  In order to lengthen this series, completely new ideas have been developed and characters have been added or have disappeared completely at the whim of the writing team.  I really do think that the ""cranford"" style could have been kept, but it would have necessitated an entirely different type of program.  There are characters who have been made to act completely opposite to how they were originally drawn and some have been modernized to such an extent that I no longer recognize them.  I'm sorry about that.  I am also exceedingly sorry about what was decided to happen with the train wreck.  Surely, surely another idea could have been used for causing that wreck.  As long as you are making the whole thing up from whole cloth now anyway, why not make a better choice in that instance?

I've chosen to assign a 3 star rating to these episodes, but I don't think I will encourage my friends to buy this set.  The special feature included here:  Cranford in Detail, is interesting but still not enough to redeem the set for me.",1263945600,12,2228,4.6521739130434785
4011151,3,B002XTBEDI,"Firstly I was thrown off that Mary Smith had not stayed with Miss Matty and that she had a disappointment? Was it the Dr.that made her glasses from the first series? It was not explained and it was irritating. Then she turns around and leaves again!

I didn't like the way Martha was killed off and I think they only did it to send Jem and Tilly away so they could come back in a so called ""magical ending."" Miss Matty's brother Peter was portrayed by a different actor and he seemed flat to me and what happened to that twinkle in his eye he had for Miss Pole?

Also, where were the doctors in this story? I found it unlikely that Dr. Harrison would leave after marrying a local(Sophie Hutton).So Cranford is left without a doctor which seemed so inconsistent to me. Not to mention the fact that the Reverend her father played a more substantial role here and he never mentioned the newlyweds nor was he ever seen with the two younger siblings. I find it hard to believe Sophie would leave them.
By contrast, the butcher's children are seen and mentioned by Caroline Tompkins' sister, but where was she and her new husband? There was only a vague hint as to why they were in her sister's care so much.

I was also looking forward to the development between Harry Gregson, Lady Ludlow and her son Lord Septimus. Mr. Carter's will was a masterpiece. Septimus finally comes back only she is dead and in a rather ridiculous way at that. I looked for a deeper connection to Harry Gregson as he is heir to a fortune and is to become educated and a gentlemen. Instead she is brought back as a frail old lady and promptly killed off. I also thought it faintly silly that Harry's family is displaced by the railway, leaves to join the father and doesn't contact him. Miss Galindo knows where they went since she spoke with his mother before she left, but Harry is seemingly left homeless? Although not in full possession of his fortune, I couldn't help but think he would have been able find them, bring them back and provide for them and once he again he could have that home away from school. It was a mountain made out of a molehill.
Altogether it seemed as if improbable events were set in place just to get the story where the writer wanted it to go. I did enjoy seeing the cow again in her clothes although they killed her off too and in the most gruesome way! As always I enjoyed Judi Dench as Miss Matty and Imelda Staunton as Miss Pole was much needed comic relief.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 part installment of Cranford and was utterly enchanted with it. I was so excited at the return, but it fell a bit flat for me.",1263859200,28,2627,4.366053169734151
4011152,2,B002XTBEDI,"Having loved CRANFORD, the original BBC series shown on Masterpiece Theatre, I placed my advance order for Return to Cranford with great expectations.  Unable to wait for the DVD to rlease I watch the two part series when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre, and found myself enjoying the first of its two parts and looking forward to the second and final installment, only to discover that it lacked everything that made the Cranford expirience what it was.

Return to Cranford picks up a year after ""Cranford"" ends.  While the four women at the center of Cranford life remain, many of the other charecters have also gone including the village doctors, without any explaination.  Given how important it was for the village to have a doctor in the first series, and then to have the doctors absent without any explainations seemed odd. The cast is smaller and many of the charecters that drove the first series are gone, one would think that the actors have gone onto others things.  However in this series the town seems less full of English life, which is what made the original Cranford so glorious.

The first of the two episodes is the better of the two.  One story line involves Lady Ludlow and her faith in her son who has failed her at every turn.  This thread seems to come off the best.  Another story line inolving actor Jonathan Price and his family - and a budding romance is keeps your interest, but it is a pale comparision to the romance in the previous episode as neither actors involved have any spark. This episode's finale has the women of Cranford doing what they do best, and perhaps they should have ended everything right here and left best alone.

However in the second episode, while the town and the relationships of the people of Cranford are put to the test, the production falls completly apart.  Too many story lines are processed too quickly - including the introduction of a new charecter and a surprise wedding go full circle -  while the story of Harry and Lord Septimus is left unresoved as is the story line of Mary Smith who appears and then disappears.  In one scene, Dame Judy Dench goes to the Railway Camp in search of another charecter and she just seems very lost - and this becomes an untentional metaphore for the viewer, who is also lost in this scramble to tie up loose ends.  But it the quick cut to, and the chop, chop, chop pacing throws the whole production off kilter. And then, probably because they killed off people in one railway explosion in the first series, the producers thought a second railway explosion would be a nice way to get rid of a few problems.  But the explosion, and accident, and its aftermath is sloppily done.  The final event with no reason, is the return of Jem and Tillie - why?  Not that I'm complaining, but it just happens.

This two part event just made me feel as if the producers had the best of intentions, but ran out of time and money.  And that is sad.  Cranford deserves better than the lot it was dealt.",1263859200,11,2991,4.555140186915888
4011153,3,B002XTBEDI,"I'll be brief. While I loved the original production of CRANFORD, I couldn't get into RETURN TO CRANFORD because I never got past the fact that the actresses looked like frumpy women dressed in straight-off-the-rack period-piece costumes. In short, this seemed an inauthentic and uninspired production and a waste of exceptional talent. When I wish to return to Cranford, I'll watch the wonderful original, thank you very much.",1263859200,4,427,5.294117647058823

And Judi Dench is brilliant as always.  Even if you don't enjoy it as much as the first, if you liked the first at all, I would be very surprised if you didn't find a whole lot to love about this one, too.  I certainly loved it, and be sure you make it all the way to the end, as it gives you one of those ""Feel Good"" endings that makes you happy you took the time to see it.",1263772800,4,549,3.7155172413793105
4011156,3,B002XTBEDI,"My wife and I really enjoy the first Cranford film/series.  It is truly excellent in pretty much every way.  Unfortunately, this effort is not nearly on par with the first.  The script, character development, story-telling, and pacing are lacking.  I think the film is still entertaining enough to be worth watching as long as you enter with lowered expectations.  In particular the actors do their best with what they are given.  The performances of Imelda Staunton and Judi Dench are worth seeing.  Other than that, where the original used the characters to good effect, this new series almost universally wastes them.

Others have commented that the first part wasn't great.  It may not have been great, but still left the door open for a promising conclusion.  The second part is borderline not good and is the undoing of the film.

Suggested Alternative Title:

It pains me, but I can't give my suggested alternative title as it might constitute a spoiler.  Suffice it to say it's dripping with metaphorical irony.  For more, see the comments on my review.",1263772800,2,1061,4.9209039548022595
4011157,3,B002XTBEDI,"It's fun to spend a little time with some of the characters from the deservedly successful ""Cranford,"" but that's about all that can be said for this weak 2-part sequel.  As others have pointed out, it's a much thinner stitchery of Gaskell's work, presumably to capitalize on the performance of the first series.  Worth watching for the pleasure of seeing some wonderful actors, but it's really only in the ""mildly diverting"" category.",1263686400,11,435,5.027777777777778
4011158,3,B002XTBEDI,"I love and own the original BBC production of Cranford (have watched it several times), was excited to hear that a three-hour ""Return to Cranford"" sequel was to be released on January 19th, and decided to pre-order it.  I must admit I was disappointed in Part One, which I watched on my local PBS station, WGBH-Boston, last Sunday night.  It felt contrived and flat, seemed poorly written, and was missing several pivotal actors.  Only the fine acting by Judi Dench and the comical Imelda Staunton redeemed this production.  Where were Dr. Harrison and his bride, Sophie Hutton (did they leave Cranford -- inpossible!), did Mrs. Rose marry the doctor and retire with him to some warm clime?, why did they have to kill off Martha (especially so soon), what about comical Caroline Tomkins and her new butcher husband, why did they replace Matty's dashing brother Peter with a far less attractive, eccentric actor (and weren't we left thinking at the end of the original Cranford that a romance might develop between Peter and Miss Pole? Instead he gives her a bird - huh?, leading to a slightly funny but kind of ridiculous ""cage"" scene), and I can't believe that Mary is engaged to a Mr. Turnbull (I thought she'd stay with Matty forever or at least for a few years since a year earlier, in the original Cranford, she denied any interest in marriage or babies).  It does seem natural for Jessie to have left for India with Major Gordon, but still I miss her (her sensitivity and emotional depth are features sadly lacking in this new production, at least Part One since I have yet to watch Part Two).  I guess I wanted everyone to pick up where they left off.  Because I am so curious about the missing characters, I really don't care about the new people -- although we heard so much about Septimus in the original Cranford that it makes sense he should arrive when Lady Ludlow dies.  Speaking of which, I didn't like that she died.  I wanted to see more of how the great Lady (and her views) changed with time and as a result of her relationship with Mr. Carter, now deceased, and Harry Gregson as he becomes educated and grows into a gentleman (and why didn't we see even one quick scene of his studies with the Reverend Hutton?).  The scene in which Lady Ludlow died was ridiculous -- sickly as she is, she stands for hours in one place and in a crooked posture waiting for her son's arrival and then all of a sudden falls to the floor dead.  Bottom line:  Part One at least just didn't work.  I had planned to watch Part Two tomorrow evening and then cancel my pre-order since the DVD wasn't scheduled for release until Tuesday.  But I got an e-mail that Amazon shipped it on Friday (and then promptly dropped the price by $.50).  Oh well, I'll put it in the drawer with the similarly disappointing sequel to the brilliant and entertaining 2002 Forsyte Saga.

1/20/10 Update:  I watched Part Two of Return to Cranford this past Sunday night and thought it better than Part One.  Then, on Tuesday, the copy of Return to Cranford that I had pre-ordered arrived (and I was credited $.50).  I watched the series again over the past two evenings and I like it much better on second viewing, so I would increase my rating to 3.5 stars.  It's still not as good as the original, but well done nonetheless.  Now I plan to re-watch the original Cranford to compare them.",1263600000,5,3364,4.554817275747508
