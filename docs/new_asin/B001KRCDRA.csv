3669018,3,B001KRCDRA,Line dancing should be fun. I've avoided it because it seemed difficult and I still can't line dance. The steps were too hard for a beginner.,1462492800,,141,4.461538461538462

3669038,5,B001KRCDRA,"This video's so bad, it's hilarious. Hubby and I  found ourselves laughing so hard that we looked forward to the daily giggle. Can't say much for the dance instruction - parts were not clear, raced through, and even not explained at all, but when she starts talking about giving a 'sexeh luke' with an accent more Scottish than Texan, I defy you to keep a straight face. I think I might have lost five pounds laughing.",1445472000,,418,4.5

3669054,2,B001KRCDRA,"Dance instruction was fine, but the music was awful--dull, boring, repetitive--not inspiring at all! Just a few background drum beats--don't buy this if you think its going to be a fun country dance music exercise.",1432857600,,214,5.142857142857143

3669073,3,B001KRCDRA,"I don't think this workout is fun. It's also hard to learn the steps. I've done the workout 3 times and I still don't have the steps down. I'd prefer if the steps were easier (and more fun). The steps get harder as the video goes along. The first workout isn't that complicated, but the 2nd and 3rd workouts are too complicated (with the steps) for me to do. I wouldn't purchase this DVD for the reasons mentioned.",1414195200,,414,4.32051282051282

3669083,5,B001KRCDRA,Country Line Dance is a fun workout.  All of the dance moved are carefully shown and explained before the start of the video.  Once learned I found myself really enjoying the dance.,1404432000,,181,4.625
3669084,4,B001KRCDRA,i like line dancing and the music i cant go to fast but it keeps me moving i go at my own speed and when i have enough i sit down rest and i get back up and keep moving when i get done with this one i will get another one just to keep me moving as much as i can.,1403827200,,262,3.2419354838709675
3669085,1,B001KRCDRA,"There is only 3 dances and the majority of the video is showing you how to do each dance (not including the separate step guide). You only do each dance in full about 2 or 3 times. Glad I bought this used and only paid $4.00. I hardly worked up a sweat, and won't be watching it again.",1399939200,,285,3.9310344827586206
3669086,5,B001KRCDRA,"A lot of workout, especially dance videos, I have tried lately have been very hard to follow, or just haven't been fun. This one was both! They put in a Step by Step Guide so you can be sure to learn all the steps without getting frustrated. Not to mention, these moves are FUN! I can't wait to go show them off!",1399593600,,312,4.048387096774194

3669089,4,B001KRCDRA,"Tho I have 2 left feet I had a blast trying to follow along with this dance video.  Anything's better than sitting in your chair, parked in front of your tv.  The production is high quality & Amy's done a great job with easy-to-follow dance moves.  Country line dancing is a hoot!",1394409600,,280,4.346153846153846
3669090,5,B001KRCDRA,Instructor not annoying and walks you through the steps. Inches are coming off just going two times a week.  Very fun and the time flies. Try it you will like it,1393804800,,161,4.193548387096774
3669091,2,B001KRCDRA,Present the steps too fast.  I could not follow. I do not use it.  It was a waste of money.,1391385600,,91,3.5
3669092,1,B001KRCDRA,The picture makes it look like fun but it is down right dull and boring! I tried to get into it but finally just shelved it.,1387324800,,124,3.8076923076923075
3669093,1,B001KRCDRA,I expected to learn specific dances to specific songs. Some of the steps are very hard to learn. I don't want to have to think this hard about something that should be fun.,1384560000,,172,4.242424242424242
3669094,4,B001KRCDRA,"Would have been better if you had talked slower Amy. I would have liked more instruction time before getting into the steps.
Otherwise great!",1382572800,,141,4.916666666666667

3669097,5,B001KRCDRA,"I think I already have picked up alot of this dancing in such a short time, so much fun and great exercise!",1375833600,,107,3.909090909090909
3669098,1,B001KRCDRA,"Wanted to brush up on learning steps on line dancing, didn't see anything close, not even the Electric Slide. Bunch of different steps to get your heart pumping.",1372982400,,161,4.785714285714286
3669099,1,B001KRCDRA,"Not what I had in mind at all. No Country Music included.. Stupid dance moves and a hillbilly version of country twang in vocabulary.
Pass on this..",1372809600,,148,4.518518518518518
3669110,4,B001KRCDRA,It's a great DVD to perk me up when I'm feeling sluggish.  In the afternoon I'm invigorated by its workout.,1372291200,,107,4.35
3669111,3,B001KRCDRA,The dance is low impact which is what I wanted but it could be a little livelier. It is also a little cheesy.,1370476800,,109,3.782608695652174
3669112,2,B001KRCDRA,The cover is misleading - Their attire is not consistant with country - they knew that which is why the cover shows different attire - and it is not that good.,1367107200,,159,4.161290322580645
3669113,3,B001KRCDRA,"I love country line dances, but this video was not what I expected. I guess I had my hopes too high.",1366761600,,100,3.8095238095238093

3669116,5,B001KRCDRA,Enjoy i very much. Love learning all the new moves. It is fun to try and keep up with the steps sometimes.,1366156800,,106,3.8636363636363638
3669117,5,B001KRCDRA,I really hope that I can work out with this and loose a lot of weight and get skinny again.,1365724800,,91,3.6
3669118,1,B001KRCDRA,not for the wii and not right cause you had theses items come up when i was oredering for the wii made ppl think they were,1365379200,,122,3.730769230769231

3669140,5,B001KRCDRA,"We were excited to receive the ""Dance off the inches DVD. It has good instructions that r easy to follow. We are glad we decided to purchase this DVD.",1361145600,,150,4.206896551724138
3669141,2,B001KRCDRA,"boring, not like expected. even my daughter looked at me and asked it that was all of it. oh well",1361145600,,97,3.9

3669143,4,B001KRCDRA,"cd was very well done, excellent for exercise, and learning to dance, i would recommend to family and friends. good job",1359936000,,119,4.714285714285714
3669144,3,B001KRCDRA,I've taken classes locally and was looking for a DVD with current dances and current music so I could get more practice.  This DVD didn't have either.  I've never seen any of these dances done live.  It still is good exercise and somewhat enjoyable.,1359849600,,249,4.613636363636363
3669145,1,B001KRCDRA,"i thought i was getting a workout that was popluar country line dances that i could learn the steps a get great fun exerise and then b able to dance at the club, not so",1358380800,,168,3.8285714285714287
3669146,3,B001KRCDRA,Not a bad DVD. Just takes alot to get me motivated!  This just didn't do it for me.  Amy is very good at showing how to execute the dance moves.  very good job on that,1357344000,,167,3.7142857142857144
3669147,4,B001KRCDRA,"The intructor was not as annoying as some other workout videos can be. If you enjoying country music and line dancing, I would recommend it to you.",1356739200,,147,4.481481481481482
3669148,4,B001KRCDRA,Definitely a good dance work out.  I love line dancing and this helps keep me sharp for our girl's night outs.,1356480000,,110,4.238095238095238
3669149,4,B001KRCDRA,"Follow the instructions and It does what it says it will.  Great exercise and dance video, will share with family and friends.",1356220800,,126,4.7272727272727275
3669150,2,B001KRCDRA,"Good for a laugh, but not an engaging workout. Also fails to even get my heart rate up at all.",1354147200,,94,3.75
3669151,4,B001KRCDRA,"For all of those people complaining that there wasn't ""popular country songs"" during the workout, rarely any of the Dance Off the Inches have popular music. The whole point of the music they choose is the beats, they aren't trying to have you get distracted with listening to the songs. The main focus is working out!!!",1331078400,,319,4.714285714285714
3669152,1,B001KRCDRA,I love country music and thought this would be a lot of fun.  Some of the steps were a little complicate but worse the whole thing was boring and didn't even get my 'old heart' rate up.,1323734400,,185,4.0
3669153,2,B001KRCDRA,I purchased this DVD for fun exercise but got frustrated and am not able to keep up with the movements. It is probably fine for young people but 50s or above it is not good. The movements are too hard to follow. Too many changes too quickly. I have been very disappointed in it. I have always loved to dance and wanted to learn line dancing but it is too hard to keep up with. I have several other DVDs for workouts and do fine with them but this one just has too many changes too often.,1322438400,,487,4.030927835051546
3669154,5,B001KRCDRA,"I love this, you can go at your own pace and just keep going back to the beginning to practice the steps... I am an older lady, but I do enjoy the moves,
I feel good that I am MOVING and getting benefit out of it... I thoroughly recommend for the oldies.. Thank you.",1313539200,,266,3.9444444444444446
3669155,1,B001KRCDRA,"This is not at all what I had hoped for.  I thought it was going to be real line dances with popular songs.  Some of the moves she shows are good, but the intensity is just not there.  I have only gone through the whole DVD once.  I was not at all impressed.  Save your money.",1308268800,,276,3.857142857142857
3669156,2,B001KRCDRA,"This dvd is more of an ""exercise"" lesson than a dance lesson. Yes they are dancing - but not a dance you will see anywhere else and not to country music you will hear again. I would have preferred real line dances and real country music. If you are NOT a country western fan then maybe it's ok because you won't know the difference.",1302652800,,332,4.203125
3669157,3,B001KRCDRA,"This is a fun very low-impact workout, but it's certainly not line dancing.  The instructor made up her own dances and the music isn't anything I've heard played a lot.  I don't think I would use these moves at a club.",1300406400,,218,4.2926829268292686
3669158,2,B001KRCDRA,"I tried this country dance dvd with my spouse. We both have back and knee problems. All the jumps and knee twists in this dvd where hard to do. If  you have bad knees then this is not your dvd. However, just the basic steps (if you leave out all the jumps and knee twisting parts of the line dance) was okay.",1299888000,,308,3.967741935483871
3669159,1,B001KRCDRA,This tape  was not much of an exercise tape or a line dancing tape.  A big waste of money.,1297641600,,90,3.6842105263157894
3669160,5,B001KRCDRA,"If you're looking for a line dancing DVD, do not buy this.  This is not line dancing.  It is more like country-ized aerobics.  The workout program is 39 minutes long.  That includes a warm up and cool down.  There is no stretching in the warm up, but you do stretch in the cool down.  I would say this is a beginner workout.  When I was young, and taught aerobics, this wouldn't have even made me sweat.  Now that I'm older, out of shape, and need to loose weight, this is perfect!  Fun and enthusiastic!  Recommend for those just beginning to exercise.",1296518400,,553,4.3861386138613865
3669161,1,B001KRCDRA,I thought since is said country line dance it would have a few line dances in it but it doesn't. They took a few country steps and created a work out from it but not really any line dancing. Would not get this again.,1289779200,,216,3.9318181818181817
3669162,5,B001KRCDRA,"Line dancing is so much fun, and I love tht country music.  So this is a great way for me to shed some pounds and inches.  The steps are shown and explained quite well.  If you have a little country in you, try it.  You'll stick with it if it's fun,",1282089600,,249,3.823529411764706
3669163,2,B001KRCDRA,This DVD was not what we expected.  Watched it once and haven't put it in again.,1278115200,,80,4.0
3669164,5,B001KRCDRA,Excellent video. Great for beginners. Very good workout while you learn to Dance. Lead instructor does a great job of keeping you interested!,1275264000,,141,5.173913043478261
3669165,5,B001KRCDRA,This Country Line dancing DVD was a lot of fun.  I look forward to exercising now. The instructor gradually worked in new moves so it was easy to follow along without having to go through the step guide first.,1272326400,,209,4.358974358974359
3669166,1,B001KRCDRA,"If you like country music this is not the DVD for you. The whole routine is very boring. The music is not country music that I ever heard before. It was a total waste of my money, so save yours.",1271462400,,194,3.875
3669167,1,B001KRCDRA,"For starters, the moves are very, very low impact, and are not explained well at all.  The ""step guide"" goes through a few simple moves, but Amy throws new ones in during the rest of the tape constantly without warning.  Further, her voice is SO irritating, and the two girls in the backround are clearly bored to death.  I actually got so bored during this tape I zoned out for a while and still didn't miss a beat.

3669171,2,B001KRCDRA,"If you've seen people line dancing at a country bar you know there's a lot of foot-stomping and yee-haw'ing, smiling and knee-slapping good times going on. This dvd is not that. Nor does it even have that the country line-dance flavor. It's basic slow-moving aerobic motions. Step-together-step. Step-together-step. Do a little spin. Step-together-step. It's a line dance you'd teach to a pre-school class. Is it outright horrible and offensive? No. Is it a good time? No. The generic 'country' beat is brain-numbing. The two back-up instructors are wearing casual street clothes and the head-instructor is about as sexy as a caddle-prod and nearly as stiff. If you want a generic, gentle step-aerobic routine led by a robot so corporate it's an insult to any self-respecting redneck, this is the dvd for you. They obviously re-shot the cover to intice people to buy. Inside there's a monotone New-Mexico-Like set which is nothing like the outside Country-cover potrays. I hate it when they do that. The lack of creativity in the 'routine' is mockable. But it does have clean, boring cueing. It's unexciting. It's tame and bland. I've bought worse. Let's put it this way: Brooks and Dunn would not approve.",1260403200,,1206,5.065326633165829

3669173,3,B001KRCDRA,"I have only done this once so far.  It was entertaining, not exhausting, but energizing. If you just want to get moving and burn some calories without being really sore the next day, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a real intense workout, this is not for you.  I like country music, but the songs on this are just some generic beats, not actual country music.  Good, not great.",1251158400,,391,4.315068493150685
3669174,1,B001KRCDRA,"This this dvd is titled country line dance, you would think that is what is about, right? wrong.  It is a dance workout tape with ""line dancing steps"" the instructor obviously made up, not the traditional ones.  Three of the sections listed on the inside cover were missing, as well as the step by step instruction guide.  Don't waste your money.",1247270400,,346,4.639344262295082
3669175,5,B001KRCDRA,"I really like this DVD.  The steps are tough enough to be challenging, but not so hard I get frustrated.  Of course, everybody is at a different level of dance ability, so whether it's too hard or too easy for you will depend on whether you've ever danced before.  But for nondancers, the DVD does have a ""step guide"" where the teacher goes over the steps more slowly.  The choreography is cute and the exercise is good...I really ""feel it"" afterwards!",1245888000,,452,4.54320987654321

3669177,5,B001KRCDRA,I was surprised by how much I've really enjoyed doing this workout!  I really didn't expect to break a sweat doing this but I was wrong.  I think it would be very difficult if not impossible to keep up without viewing the step guide first.  I did the step guide about three times before I attempted to do the workout.,1240185600,,317,4.25

I have a few of the Dancing off the Inches dvds and I find them all Fun and interesting to do. Looking for more and always having a ball doing these dvds.

Buy it if you like to work out, but hate the boring workouts. You'll have fun and it will keep you moving!!",1239321600,,400,4.0
3669179,4,B001KRCDRA,The instructor does a good job of breaking everything down during the step guide. This video was fun to do and it does do a good job at providing a basic cardio workout that is fun to do. The only thing I would change is to have maybe some familiar line dances. Overall very good and glad I bought it.,1237248000,,301,4.033333333333333
3669181,5,B001KRCDRA,"This dance DVD is a nice change of pace from the usual latin/jazz/hip hop routines that are typical in the marketplace.

1.  There is a separate step guide that comes on this DVD.  Unless you are already familiar with line dancing, I strongly recommend you do the step guide first as the instructor does not slow down during the routines to teach you a new step.  In the step guide, the instructor walks you through the step in half time and then takes you up to speed.  You learn 10 new steps and some of them are a bit complicated. There is not a lot of repetition, so I even recommend you try the step guide a couple of times before doing the routines.

2.  What I like about this DVD is that the steps are complicated and there are a lot of steps to a routine, so it keeps you interested.  If you're just looking for a simple dance routine, this may not be the one for you.  Normally, I can do most dance DVD's pretty well on the second or third attempt.  I think it will take me about 5 or 6 times before I get down all of the routines.

3.  There is some hopping, so the DVD is not totally low impact.  If you don't hop, you can modify the steps fairly easily.

4.  Because of the style of the dance, there is less upper body movement than the typical dance DVD. My feet stay pretty busy, so I don't miss the arm movements.  I have also found that this DVD is good for improving balance.

5.  Like most dance DVD's, it does not give the very physically fit an challenging workout.  But it's fun and keeps you interested.

6.  The instructor does a fair to good job of cuing, but there is some room for improvement.

All in all, I do like this dance video and I recommend it as a lot of fun. If you like this DVD you may also like dance DVD's with Jennifer Galardi as the instructor.  She offers routines with similar intensity, slightly less complexity in the foot work and more upper body movement. Enjoy!",1232841600,,1912,4.178082191780822
3669182,5,B001KRCDRA,"GREAT FUN.  I will be ""borrowing"" these moves for my class as well as in the club for years to come.

By the end of the DVD, not only have you learned a fun, new line dance...but you have also burned lots of calories! This DVD can be for all ages and fitness levels.  I am a fitness instructor as well and am always looking for something ""different"" to mix in with the typical aerobics classes you find at the gyms. This DVD is just what I was looking for! I will continue to include this fun exercise DVD in my workout regimen and recommend it to everyone I see! Great job!",1231804800,,756,4.309859154929577

3669185,5,B001KRCDRA,"I own all of the Dance off the Inches series, and I really love this one!  It is so much fun, and line dancing is really a nice change of dance.  The instructor is southern style with excellent instruction and cueing.  The DVD is very well organized and the dances flow well.  I can see how it could seem low impact because line dancing doesn't use as many arm movements (thumbs are tucked in pockets or waistline).  However, I am an intermediate and found it to be a great workout.  I took my hands out of my pockets and let my arms flow with the moves.  Also, since line dancing can be tricky with the feet, since you're kicking  your ""boots"" up, it makes the routine easier to follow if you don't have alot of arm movements to incorporate.  I would really like to see more line dancing DVD's and the instructor did a wonderful job.  This is fun for a beginner or intermediate.  I should note that of all the Dance off the Inches DVD's, I have never had to use the step guide that is provided on the DVD.  However, this is the first time I did utilize the step guide.  And although there are some fancy feet moves, they are easy to follow with a little patience, and I picked it up after a few times.  Great DVD and guaranteed to have alot fun doing it!",1231286400,,1255,4.196652719665272
3669186,3,B001KRCDRA,"This work out is definately a low impact workout. The music is upbeat and only instrumental. The dance steps are easy to learn and fun to dance. I would have prefered music i was familiar with, since dancing country is usually to your favorite country songs. I have been working out at home with other, more high impact DVD's for over a year now, so this one seemed to be a bit too slow for me. I did break a sweat, but a small one. If you are a beginner to working out at home this may be a good place for you to start. I will use this on days when I don't have a lot of energy, but still desire to exercise.",1231113600,,609,3.9193548387096775
