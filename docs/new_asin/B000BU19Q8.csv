8092697,1,B000BU19Q8,"Two movies were supposed to be on this Ronald Reagan DVD, ""Santa Fe Trail"" and ""This is the Army.""  The DVD case indeed noted as much.  Printing on the DVD itself specified the DVD as being two sided, and noted that ""Army"" was on Side A and ""Santa Fe"" on Side B.  Side B had barely discernable printing noting ""Ronald Reagan"" and some numbers.  Side A worked okay--the picture quality of this old film was slightly dark, but the film was easily watchable--but for Side B my Blu Ray player would only specify there was ""No disc.""  Also, I noted that an ""X"" had been gouged onto Side A near the center hole.  I have  initiated the ""return"" function of the transaction, which so far seems to be working well.  I look forward either to a replacement DVD that works or a refund.  When I receive one or the other, I will withdraw any complaint.",1446595200,,838,4.354838709677419

8092699,4,B000BU19Q8,"This Ronald Reagan Double Feature offers an interesting pair of films for the most successful actor ever to go into politics.  On the 4th of July in 1942, ""This Is the Army"" opened on Broadway with book, lyrics and music by Irving Berlin, who persuaded the War Department to let him have 300 service men to do the show and thereby raise $10 million for Army Relief. The 1943 movie version, directed by Michael Curtiz for Warner Brothers, starred another future Califronia politican, (Senator) George Murphy, who played father Jerry Jones to Reagan's son Johnny Jones.  Reagan had just entered the military and was assigned to making ""This Is the Army"" before moving on to military training films.

Scenarists Casey Robinson and Claude Binjoy came up with a story lined that worked in material from Berlin's legendary 1917 soldier show ""Yip, Yip, Yiphank."" Set during World War I, Murphy plays a Broadway song and dance man who is drafted and put in charge of an army show. Murphy sings and dances to ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" ""My Sweetie"" and ""We're On Our Way to France.""  After the final performance the cast marches off to war, where Jerry Jones receives a leg wound. Then we jump to the start of World War II, Jerry is now a Broadway producer and son Johnny is his assistant. Kate Smith singing ""God Bless America"" and Berlin himself singing ""Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning."" This show also includes ""This is the Army, Mr. Jones,"" which is probably the only other song contemporary audiences might still recognize, if you are old enough.  History repeats itself, this time with Johnny enlisting and taking time to marry his sweetheart, Eileen Dibble (Joan Leslie), before marching off to the swelling strains of ""This Time We Will All Make Certain.""

Santa Fe Trail"" is a fine action film giving viewers another chance to watch Errol Flynn romance Olivia de Havilland having already won her in both ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Captain Blood,"" with Reagan playing the best friend who loses out on the gal this time around. Just to make things interesting in this 1940 film directed by Michael Curtiz, Flynn plays James Elwell Brown (J.E.B.) Stuart and Reagan plays George Armstrong Cuter (Olivia is Kit Carson Halliday, but she's not THAT Kit Carson). Screenwriter Robert Buckner takes some of the better known generals from the Civil War--Stuart, Custer, Sheridan, Longstreet, Pickett, Hood--and turns them into a young band of brothers out to bring order to the frontier at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

The true Civil War history buff will marvel every time the film gets something right (e.g., Stuart really did graduate from West Point in 1954), and the film ends on an ominous note with Robert E. Lee (Moroni Olson) commanding the troops that capture John Brown (Raymond Massey) at Harpers Ferry. I am not complaining at all of the historical errors because I saw a movie version of ""Moby Dick"" where Ahab kills the whale, so I certainly do not expect much from Hollywood at that point in time.  Consequently, when the characters never actually make it as far as the Santa Fe Trail, I am not overly surprised. As the tagline for ""Santa Fe Trail"" declared: ""They carved a path through the wilderness... then paved it with bullets and lives!"" Flynn gets the girl, Reagan helps him get the bad guys, and Alan Hale provides some comic relief as legendary scout Tex Bell. For my money the action sequences are better in ""Santa Fe Trail"" than when Flynn gets his chance to play Custer in ""They Died With Their Boots On,"" for what that is worth.",1134864000,,3563,4.7821138211382115
