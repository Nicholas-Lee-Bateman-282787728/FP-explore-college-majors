2543804,5,B000EX9O0U,"Ruggero Deodato is another one of the prolific Italian directors from the sixties and seventies, who made a career in horror, romantic, and thriller films. In his case, he was also successful in advertising.  He helmed the cult classic ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" which has been referred to as ""one of the most infamous splatter films of all time."" ""Waves of Lust"" is an exquisite erotic thriller, one of his masterpieces that are finally getting a well-deserved new opportunity to be enjoyed at its highest quality..

Barbara (Silvia Dionisio, Deodato's real-life wife) and Irem (Al Cliver) are an easy going couple that wanders around in the beautiful coastal town of Cefalu. While walking around the beach, they notice Giorgio (John Steiner) mistreating Silvia (Elizabeth Turner), his girlfriend. Barbara and Irem don't appreciate what's going on, and purposely make friends with Giorgio and Silvia. Giorgio is a spoiled rich-boy who owns a yacht, which happens to be anchored off coast. He is rude and really don't care about people's feelings, always looking to amuse himself at the expense of others. In particular, he hates the proletariat. At one point, Barbara tells him, ""You can't keep taking and never give,"" to which Giorgio answers, ""People like me never go to jail!"" Eventually, Giorgio invites his new friends to his yacht, where the fun is really about to start, and the truth eventually will also surface.

""Waves of Lust"" is exciting and will keep you up until the final scene. It's a great thriller, full of beautiful scenery and plenty nudity, including Dionisio (who rather get herself naked in front of her husband for this movie, than other women) and Turner. The DVD includes deleted scenes, the director's filmography and biography, a booklet describing the film and Deodato's life, and much more!

2543805,4,B000EX9O0U,"[WAVES OF LUST - 1975 - Widescreen 1.85:1 - In English or Italian w/ English subtitles - directed by Ruggero Deodato - 88 min.] Although he had a highly respectable career as a television and commercial director, Ruggero Deodato is best remembered for his notorious exploitation classics, 'Jungle Holocaust' (1977), 'Cannibal Holocaust' (1980) and 'The House on the Edge of the Park' (1980). He even directed a notable crime drama 'Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man' (1976), but this entry from the previous year is unlike his known body of work, for better or worse. BTW, Lamberto Bava was only one of four co-writers here, and had nothing to do with its direction.

Two couples bump shoulders at a seaside resort, one wealthy, one not, and get entangled in each others crosshairs with typically wretched results. Highly despicable and wealthy financier Giorgio (John Steiner) and his virtual slave of a lover and part-time subject of abuse, Silvia (Elizabeth Turner), hook up with Irem (Al Cliver) and Barbara (Deodato's wife, Silvia Dionisio) for a weekend cruise aboard Giorgio's massive yacht for a protracted and provocative game of cat and mouse. Not one of the four is under any illusion that this is a simple pleasure trip; Giorgio has had designs on Barbara since he first laid eyes on her ashore, Barbara suspects the levels of physical and mental abuse heaved upon Silvia by her husband and appears to plan retaliation while possibly sleeping with the brutal bastard, Irem knows of the intentions of both Giorgio and his own mate and is apparently indifferent (or is he?), and poor Silvia is desperate for attention and respite from her abuser, secretly plotting a love triangle with the other couple, who conspire against the ruthless misogynist who's also a paranoid alcoholic. Got all that?

While complications pile up, so does the clothing as all four spend most of the flick naked or near-nude, whether diving underwater, changing for dinner, tempting and teasing one another, sunbathing, making love or engaged in Sapphic massages. There's an over-abundance of sleazy 70's Euro-grindhouse nudity but, thankfully, both women are easy on the eyes and seeing them prance and preen is pleasurable for voyeurs like me. (Most women believe that there's no such thing as being too rich or too thin; most men believe that there's no such thing as too much female nudity...) Deodato's camera lingers on the flesh lovingly and longingly - it's a pervert's paradise, which is odd when you factor that one of the women flaunted is his own wife. But don't mistake this as a complaint on my part.

By the time the proceedings are about to wrap up, we viewers feel as though we've spent too much time with these unlikable, scheming characters too, and can't wait to see the impending debacle unfold but, until then, we sit awash in 'Waves of Lust' as the tides roll in. A 3 star film elevated to 4 due to the pervasive 70's Eurosleaze hurled at us by a true exploitation auteur.

Once again, RARO VIDEO has delivered a beautiful remastered print w/ great audio, and has added several bonus features as well as a nice-sized collectible booklet. Considering the market for such product is so small, they truly must be commended for treating their fanbase so affectionately. All hail Raro Video!",1347667200,27,3294,4.897849462365591
2543806,1,B000EX9O0U,"I'm a sucker for underwater sequences in films.  I'm a sucker for Italian stuff.  I'm a sucker for period illustrations of scantily clad women.  I didn't really pay attention to the description of this film, however.  For some reason, Amazon offers a lot of old schlockly films from the 60s and 70s that combine sexploitation with violence.  Why this combo ever appealed to anyone, I don't know, but it's rather disgusting.  This is simply another one of those films, but an a foreign Italian one instead of an American one.  This film has bad conception, bad writing, bad directing, bad filmography.  Only, you can say there is a pretty girl in it, but so what?  I'm a triple sucker, and I got suckered into buying this one.  Don't be a sucker like me.  You'll regret it.  Unless you're one of those twisted people that like this genre of film.",1274054400,8,845,4.597315436241611

8115446,4,B000EX9O0U,"Waves of Lust (1975) is a film along the lines of Madness (1980), by Fernando Di Leo, but not quite.  Deodato casted his wife at the time, who was Silvia Dionisio, as one of the main female characters in the film.  Deodato must have been a freak, because he was filming his wife half naked in the arms of not one but three people, two men and one woman...I don't know what he was thinking, but I bet he was getting turned on watching his sexy wife make out with guys and gals...while exposing her voluptuous breasts and buttocks.  That is basically what the film has to offer...lots of sleazy scenes featuring topless women, some alright dialogue, and a tension leading to a build up with a somewhat surprising finale...

(minus one star for) The film lacks in good soundtrack and is full of plot-holes that are impossible to overlook.  What saves the film is sexy ladies, plenty of eroticism, and a good does of tense atmosphere between the key four characters...also John Steiner as the antagonistic George will make you feel either contempt or admiration for him.

If I had to compare this film in terms of theme to other films, I would have to name two: 1) Knife in the Water (1962) and Purple Noon (1960).",1443830400,3,1210,4.527522935779817

8115452,4,B000EX9O0U,"Deceit, lies , and full frontal nudity (female, of course) abound in Director Ruggero Deodato's 'WAVES OF LUST'
aka 'ONDATA DI PIACERE'- 1975, a slick, enjoyable Euro thriller camouflaged by its soft core porn milieu. There were many of these types of films being made at that time in Europe. Directors Jess Franco and Aristide Massaccesi aka Joe d'Amato lensed them throughout the late seventies/early eighties and yet, Deodato's film comes off so much better as the sleaze factor is forced into the background and allowing the story to unfold at its own pacing.  The film is constantly compared to Director Roman Polanski's second feature 'KNIFE IN THE WATER' -1962 but only slightly hints at it. The screenplay and ideas by Lamberto Bava, Gianlorenzo Battaglia, Franco Bottari and Fabio Pittoro introduce many elements such as blackmail, domination, an early suicide (or is it murder ) which is never explained and envelops the viewer into a spiders web spinning into horrible possibilities that are placed strategically on to the screen where finally when the final denoument is revealed, the viewer is forced to exhale and say 'Ah, that's what it was all about'.  The acting quartet consists of: actor John Steiner who plays his egotistical character to the hilt and would also shine in Director Mario Bava's underrated ghost story 'SHOCK' aka 'BEYOND THE DOOR 2'-1977 ; Silvia Dionisio who was the wife of Deodato at the time and insisted on being in the film if her husband was filming abundant nudity; Elisabeth Turner who appeared in Director Lucio Fulci's 'THE PSYCHIC' aka 'SETTE NOTE IN NERO'-1977, and Al Cliver who was in at least five of Fulci's horror films.  The superb camerawork (on the yacht and under water) is by its screen writer Gianlorenzo Battaglia and Mario Capriotti showing off the scenic landscapes of Cefalu and its peppered with a nice progressive rock score by Marcelio Giombini.  Raro Video has now replaced No Shame films as a fantastic source for Italian cinema and this release boasts a beautiful 1.85 transfer in Italian with English Subtitles which is light years ahead of the poor dubbed SLP VHS copy which circulated over a decade ago.  It's extras include a 17 minute featurette called 'EROTIC TSUNAMI' including interviews with Directors Deodato and Lamberto Bava and actors Al Cliver and Deodato's son Saverio who cameos at the beginning of the film; Deleted scenes from a slightly longer English version which comprise of elongated sexual scenes trimmed surprisingly from the Italian version; Some early Television commercials with audio commentary by Deodato, and a director biography/filmography which also appears in a booklet with a critical analysis by Eric Cotenas contained in the slip case.  If you pair this film with Director Herbert Ross's underrated thriller 'THE LAST OF SHEILA'-1977,another film which takes place on a yacht and which contains similar surprises but less sex, you'll be in for a helluva good time. 'WAVES OF LUST' is Director Ruggero Deodato's simplest work before his violent cinema years culminating in my favorite 'CUT AND RUN' aka 'INFERNO IN DIRETTA'-1985 and yet it shows how a good erotic thriller can be made even if the director didn't believe in the project from the start.",1363564800,7,3258,5.080373831775701
