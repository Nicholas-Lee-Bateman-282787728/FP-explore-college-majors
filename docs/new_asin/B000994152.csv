8058465,4,B000994152,"After gaining a new Zoid, Irvine is gonna be able to fight along with Van against the Geno Breaker. That fight may be on hold for a while. A new enemy with a giant Zoid called the Death Stinger has attacked, and is bent on destroying the world. Why do all bed guys want to destroy the world?

This series is really fun. There are lots of cool characters, action, drama, comedy, and a pretty engrossing plot. I'd say that this series borders on addicting. When it was on TV at 5:30 in the morning all those years ago, I actually woke up, watched it, and went back to sleep before going to high school at 8am. It takes a hell of a good show to get me up that early in the morning. The only complaint I have is the price. I started collecting Zoids when it was first coming out. It seems like the DVD's were around $10 or $15 new back then. I've seen the prices of them now, and I think it's ridiculous. They are out of print, and there are more and more people that will hold on to them once they get them. If you find a decent deal on them, I'd jump on it. It looks like the whole series will run about $700. I would like to see them released again since they are rare. Anyway, this series is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",1354924800,,1258,3.992063492063492
8058466,3,B000994152,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.

ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste.",1167523200,,788,3.9559748427672954
8058467,4,B000994152,"Zoids: Chaotic Century is one of my favorite animes.  When I saw the DVD at Borders, I nearly blacked out.  It was only 15 dollars, so I bought it.  As soon as I'd gotten home, I popped it in my DVD player and was practically in Nirvana, but was a bit disappointed.

The downside of this DVD is simply that this is the edited English dub, meaning that that the DVD was in kids' format sadly.  There should be a bilingual version, and the episodes on this are some of the most questionable ones to be aired on CN, they should have left them undedited.  These are great epidsodes, wrong version.  If you want to watch Zoids at its best, download the Japanese version, it's better.",1141430400,,678,4.333333333333333
