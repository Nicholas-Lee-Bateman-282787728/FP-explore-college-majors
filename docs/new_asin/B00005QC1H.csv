7950183,5,B00005QC1H,"I really love this video.  Ann Smith is such an inspiration in showing that just because a person is middle aged or older doesn't mean they can't still be flexible. I do this video every morning when I first get up. It only takes 3 minutes a day and it helps me get all those little ""kinks"" out. Well worth the time.",1122422400,,316,4.096774193548387
7950184,5,B00005QC1H,"Physical fitness is not just for the ""young and beautiful"" as Ann Smith ably demonstrates to her video audience. She performs each of the seven stretches with enviable grace and flexibility. I told my spouse, ""If that old woman can do it, then so can I""; he thought that would be a good name for the tape! Ann demonstrates each exercise twice - the first time she provides a voiceover describing what you're doing; the second time you do the same exact exercise (the same clip is shown twice) with no verbal cuing. I would like her to talk a little more about form as you're doing the exercises; visual imagery helps me figure out what I'm supposed to be doing and whether I'm doing it right or not. I also wish she would talk you through the second time as well, because when I'm twisting away from the screen or hanging down my head, I can't see what she's doing, and I either fall behind her or worry that I will. Even though these are very short stretch exercises meant to be done each morning, it also works to combine them all for a nice 20-minute stretch. And it feels great.",1085529600,3,1082,4.361386138613861
7950185,5,B00005QC1H,"I really enjoyed this video. I am very sluggish in the mornings and don't really have the time for a full workout because of my hectic schedule. What was so appealing to me about this video was that there was a short segment for each morning that I could find time to complete before rushing out the door. It gives me the extra pick-up that I need before a long day at work. Also, I really liked the fact that I didn't need to rewind the tape after I was finished with my segment for the day. I thought the concept behind the video was very clever and perfect for my lifestyle. Thanks Ann!",1052870400,2,589,4.175438596491228
7950186,4,B00005QC1H,"I have been using this tape for about 6 weeks and am very pleased with the results already!  I have never been a regular exerciser and at 52 feel the consequences-- these simple stretches are easy to do, make me feel graceful and awake and have already made me more flexibile.  I highly recommend this tape for a little out of shape, maybe a little older people who don't have much time for exercise.  I use some of the stretches during the day after sitting at my computer for a long time -- it feels great.",1044489600,,508,4.270833333333333
7950187,1,B00005QC1H,"I have been using stretching and exercising videos for several years and add to my collection about four times a year.  This is the worst I have ever purchased and wish I could return it!
These are seven different 3-minute routines for first thing in the morning to get you moving.  That SOUNDS just fine.  In reality, it seems to be a show for what Ann Smith can do.  If you have a serious background in ballet, you MIGHT enjoy this video.  Otherwise, I suggest you keep on searching.
The instruction is limited to quickly watching her do the routine and then following along with her as best as you can.  Perhaps, after a while one gets the idea of the movements.
The presentation tone of the movement is VERY serious indeed.  I suggest you research this one carefully before purchasing it.",1019347200,13,792,4.535211267605634
