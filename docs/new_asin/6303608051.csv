694770,5,6303608051,"Mrs. Guppy and I are small fish in the opera review world. We absolutely love this dvd of what was probably a very risky production. Who would dare put attractive young people who can sing well in a video of La Boheme if they could otherwise have had unattractive middle aged people who can sing very well. Let's face it, if opera as an art form is to survive, it must compete with Hollywood and TV. This is a lovely snapshot of something that happened in the recent past and does have its flaws or things some people don't like, but, we find, every opera production has someone who will say, for example, Callas would have been better. That may be true but better to take the good than to dwell on the bad. Life is short. Up with young people. Eat dessert first.",1364169600,2,763,4.305555555555555
694771,5,6303608051,"I enjoy epic, fantastical operas, like The Magic Flute or Turandot, I don't usually like the small scale social commentary. Writing that, I sound very unintelligent, I just noticed. Not the point. THIS opera, on the other hand, was a small group of bohemian friends and their relationships. I loved it. I haven't liked all versions I've seen or heard, but this one was excellent. Naturally, it being Baz Luhrmann the director of Moulin Rouge!, it was very stylized and modern. There was great chemistry between the two stars. Most operas seem kind of stuffy, with Domingo superficially holding the soprano like, I don't know, hard to describe, but not inviting, not passionate. These two were very engaging. The fellow bohemians were hilarious and awesome and overall, the entire thing was so enjoyable, that I've watched it many times, putting it up there with being as entertaining as Bergman's Magic Flute. Very watchable. Great talent. Lots o' fun. I highly recommend it.",1272844800,5,975,5.0246913580246915

694774,5,6303608051,"I happen to love opera, but also know there are many people who say they would never watch or listen to one.  Well, here is an opera production so carefully crafted, well sung & acted by a group of young, extremely talented people that it rivals -- in intensity and anticipation -- the very best daily soap operas on TV.  Director Baz Luhrmann (""Moulin Rouge"") has moved this ""La Boheme"" from 1890's Paris to 1950's Paris without losing an ounce of intensity; and he has given us a cast of singers from the Australian Opera whose vocal talents and physical appeal make watching and listening to this heartfelt story riveting, even for the most confirmed of non-opera skeptic.  There are many other more traditional and excellent ""Bohemes"" available on CD or DVD sung by renouned singers, but none of them -- to my thinking, anyway -- can touch the total appeal of this all-around excellent production.  I have never failed to show it to an audience who didn't want to see it again.  Take a chance on it: you won't be disappointed!",1252627200,5,1030,4.637362637362638
694775,5,6303608051,"I remember seeing this when it was broadcast on PBS in the 90s and being appreciative of the youthful performers but little else.

What a difference time makes!  My disappointment in David Hobson's lighter-than-expected voice was replaced by his pathos in Act III; he and Cheryl Baker really ""sold"" that scene in a way I've not experienced in the opera house.  Their playfulness in the snow as they walk off is a minor stroke of genius.  And in ACT IV, Rodolfo doesn't rush to Mimi after he realizes she has died, but stands on the ladder, weeping; his grief is heard even after the orchestral sounds fade.  These are just two of the many nuances that bring this opera to life in a very different, more immediate, way.

I still have some reservations about Christine Douglas' Musetta (she sounds a little shrill to me), but the title of the work is ""The Bohemians"" and this performance stresses more than just the familiar ""boy meets/loses/regains/loses"" plot.",1230336000,4,960,4.787878787878788
694776,4,6303608051,"Having seen and heard so many productions of this great opera, including seeing the incomparable team of Freni and Pavarotti, I approached this production with some trepidation.  Baz Luhrmann is a respected director, but inexperienced in opera.  The cast looked a little too pretty, and I worried that the whole thing might be just a tad too slick for me.  Those worries completely vanished by Mimi's entrance.  This is an excellent production, suitable for both opera neophytes and connoisseurs.

David Hobson may just be the best looking Rodolfo you've ever seen.  He gave a wonderful, fully invested performance.  His vocal problems were a fast vibrato and some lip and jaw tension.  Nonetheless, he sang in tune, and was completely believable as the poet who loses his heart to Mimi.  Cheryl Barker was an excellent Mimi.  Her most important and exposed arias (""Si. Mi chiamano Mimi"" and ""Donde lieta usci"") were very well done.  Her only issue was Italian pronunciation, an issue she shared with others in the cast.  Christine Douglas was a very good Musetta.  She was feisty, flirty, and just a bit of a diva. She would be a perfect Musetta, were it not for some intonation issues.  I really enjoyed listening to and watching Roger Lemke as Marcello.  He's got an amazing baritone instrument, and he sang and acted the part beautifully.  David Lemke (Schaunard) and Gary Rowley (Colline) were amazing singers.

But in my mind, what sets this opera apart and makes it worth owning is the production itself.  It is visually interesting.  The gray, dingy garret in Act 1 is contrasted by vibrant costume colors on the guys. Color plays a prominent role in this show. Throughout much of the opera, ""L'amour"" appears prominently on the set.  The Cafe Momus scene was crowded, with well choreographed disorder and just a little decadence. The relationships between the characters were all well developed and believable.  The acting was generally outstanding.  The camera work is superb, giving you a nice seat on stage. This production really reflected a great director and an outstanding production staff.

Baz Luhrmann showed his full game with Mimi's death scene.  It was amazing.  As Mimi lay dying, singing with Rodolfo, Schaunard was in a window upstage right, smoking, with his back to the audience.  He put the cigarette out on stage in a slow, defeated kind of way.  When Mimi died, all of the principals were facing at an angle upstage, heads bowed as if in prayer, with Rodolfo center stage on a ladder.  When he learns that Mimi is dead, his legs turn to rubber and it looks as though he can hardly make it down the ladder.  His audible sobbing continues though a slow, silent blackout. It was chilling, and you could hear a pin drop in the audience even after the set went to black.  Wow.

Highly recommended.",1229817600,6,2822,4.853249475890985
694777,5,6303608051,"Both my wife and I love ""La Bohme"", but we are particularly delighted with the Baz Luhrmann rendition of it. We first saw it @ the Opera House in San Francisco, CA, several years ago and truly loved the performance. When we learned that there was a DVD of this performance, done in Australia, we bought it and delighted in reliving the original San Francisco experience. We definitely will view it again and again. A ""must"" for any ""La Bohme"" fan.",1229040000,3,447,4.530864197530864
694778,5,6303608051,"I have been a fan of this opera since I purchased my first album of it as a pre-teen in the late 1960's. Since then I think I have gotten or have listened to almost every version.

When I saw the David Hobson version from 1993, I fell to my knees!!  I had never heard or seen a more stunning interpretation of Puccini's greatest!!  I realized I had never seen ""La Boheme"" the way it was intended until then!  David Hobson's heart felt and heart-wrenching performance brings me to tears each time! The entire cast is great, but it is David Hobson's magnificent presence that drives the production!!!

David, ""Bravo"" a thousand times! THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME REALLY FEEL THIS WONDERFUL STORY FOR THE FIRST TIME!!! You are truly a great artist!!!",1222041600,4,744,4.56390977443609
694779,3,6303608051,"There are many novelties in this performance, but the staging is eccentric. Soprano Cheryl Barker stands out for her sympathetic singing, but her Italian pronunciation is marred by a strong English accent. Some singers have tattoos and smoke cigarettes on stage. Perhaps this is a heavy-handed reference to the fact that Puccini, a chain smoker, died of a heart attack after an operation for throat cancer. I was particularly disappointed by the final scene with the death of Mimi where Rodolfo, after discovering that Mimi has died, remains on a ladder rather than rushing to her side to sing his final lines. (Why do modern stage directors have this ridiculous fetish with ladders.) Despite its imperfections, the old Karajan,Freni,Raimondi,Panerai recording remains the most moving performance of La Bohme on DVD. To be honest, despite the popularity of this opera, a definitive performance of La Bohme on DVD still does not exist. Of course, there may be one I haven't seen.",1203811200,4,978,5.11875
694976,5,6303608051,"Like many others, my favorite opera is Puccini's La Boheme.  I have seen several performances and heard even more recordings and excerpts.  By far my favorite performance and by far the one I have played the most is the 1993 Australian Opera performance with Cheryl Barker and David Hobson.

Are Barker, Hobson, and the rest of the Australians as good musically as the likes of Freni, Pavarotti, and Von Karajan?  No.  If I want to hear the most wonderful singing and orchestral work, the 1972 studio recording with Von Karajan is superior.  However, for me, the Australians do the opera as a whole better.  The music making of both major and minor characters closely and consistently fits the story line.  For example, when Hobson's Rodolfo sings Che Gelida Manina, the aria in which his lighter voice is most exposed, he sounds (and looks) more like a guy trying to hit on a girl than an opera singer trying to earn applause.  Other factors also make a difference. Barker's Mimi understands a stage whisper.  When she sings softly, you still hear and understand her.  Freni, my all-time favorite Mimi, along with many other Mimi's, sometimes reduces the volume so low in soft sections that she can be quite difficult to hear.  Finally, but not least, the acting and sets work much better for me than other versions.

After seeing the Australians, I understand La Boheme in ways I had never done before.  In particular, I understand that the Rodolfo has character flaws that are as important to the story as Mimi's illness.  In the libretto, Rodolfo is not only beset by jealousy, he lies frequently.  His biggest deception is not telling Mimi that he thinks she is fatally ill and that the living conditions he provides are contributing to her illness.  Instead, he tells her that ""You are not for me"" and to find another boyfriend.  Until, she overhears him in the third act, she never learns that he thinks another man might provide conditions that could save her life.  When you watch or hear virtually all other versions, Rodolfo is played as a heroic person, not one who has hidden critical and vital information from his lover in order to preserve his own image.

The libretto of La Boheme is distinguished by its many observations of human behavior and human nature.  The Australians consistently illustrate what is happening in the libretto in detail and depth where typical performances tend to be hit and miss, sometimes glossing over the meaning of what is occurring while still singing all the words and playing all the notes.  This attention extends beyond the words a principle sings to actions and behaviors not explicit in the libretto.  Notice how Hobson's Rodolfo is overly fond of wine, sneaking a drink even as he first meets Mimi.  Also note how the characters of Schaunard and Colline are developed beyond the libretto.  In the Australians' production, they are clearly very good friends and are often seen conversing in the background.  While Schaunard is flamboyant in his yellow suit, Colline is a prankster.  See how he appropriates Schaunard's scarf at the beginning of the second act and later takes the place of the kid imitating Musetta's walk.

The total result feels more like watching a movie than an opera.  This feeling is enhanced by camera angles that one seldom sees when watching opera.  The turning set lets you experience both the outside as well as the inside of Rodolfo's garret.  When Mimi steps outside to see Rodolfo's friends, you can see her looking over rooftops after first glancing down.  In the last act, note the view of Mimi from the side, i.e. from Rodolfo's viewpoint.  The movie-like experience is so strong for me that I have to shut off the picture to really listen to the singing.  When the picture is present, the orchestra actually fades into the background so much I have difficulty noticing it.

In looking at several amateur reviews of the Australians' performance, I think others have also been seduced by the visual show into not really attending to the music making.  A surprising minority of persons seem to think the Australians only look great and do not perform well musically, just as a surprising number believe that Anna Netrebko is all charisma and sex appeal and cannot really sing.  In fact, both the Australians and Netrebko actually sing very, very well.  Those who think the singing is poor or that the conducting is flabby should listen again without watching the picture.  (If you have little time or patience, just compare the last half of Act 4 with your favorite version.)  If I had to keep just one production of the opera, I would keep the Australian.  While I would dearly miss the voices of Freni and Pavarotti, I prefer the totality of the experience provided by the Australians.  Their version of La Boheme is the one to which I return the most.",1200700800,4,4839,4.801692865779928
694977,5,6303608051,"This production with David Hobson and Cheryl is simply superb.  Set in Parisian fifties, David Hobson's lyrical voice and gorgeous looks lend great empathy to the role.  Cheryl Barker sings and acts beautifully and the whole production leaves not a dry eye in the house.  Wonderful!",1189209600,4,282,5.086956521739131
694978,5,6303608051,"First of all, what drew me to watch this performance back in 1994 was director, Baz Luhrmann, who brought us the beautiful, delightfully quirky Strictly Ballroom.  I was interested to see how he would direct one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking operas I know.  Needless to say, I was completely enchanted!
The story of a group of Bohemians living together, and barely scraping by, and then the writer of the group, Rudolfo (David Hobson) meeting the beautiful and frail Mimi (Cheryl Barker) who brings sunshine and hope into his life is timeless.
Not only is the acting strong, but the singing is positively stirring.  I know other customers have mentioned David Hobson's portrayal of Rudolfo, but I had to add my two cents as well.  He is a magnificent and stirring singer and smouldering actor.  I kept wishing I was Mimi instead of Cheryl Barker.  From his expressive eyes, to his beautiful and graceful renditions of the arias, I was in love from the moment I saw him.  Cheryl Barker is also beautiful and very believable in her portrayal of Mimi.  Just lovely.  The supporting cast was great, too.  Schaunard, Musetta, and all of the others were portrayed with zest.  Please check this out!!!!! You won't be disappointed.",1082937600,5,1233,4.851674641148326
694979,5,6303608051,"While all the singers performed admirably, the most impressive thing about this production was the singing of tenor David Hobson.  His voice is perfectly placed at all times, reminiscent of singers such as John McCormack and Jussi Bjorling.  Many tenors rest their fortunes only on their high notes.  Hobson sings the entire range beautifully, including the high C in Che Gelida Manina.  With his ease of production, it is just another note, as it should be.  This is why he is a great singer and this is a great La Boheme.",989539200,8,523,4.7032967032967035
694980,5,6303608051,"With its gloriously tuneful music and easy-to-follow story, ""La Boheme"" is widely considered to be the perfect choice for a first-timer's exposure to opera. This finely-detailed Austrailian Opera production should satisfy operatic newcomers and cognitive fans alike. Uniquely conceived and dazzlingly executed, it is both visually and aurally compelling. Though presented upon the standard large scale, this Boheme also cleverly manages to create a sublimely intimate ambiance. And of no small note: the ebullient staging, orchestra, and voices & characterizations magically (and refreshingly) meld into a single storytelling entity, breathing uncommon vibrancy into this musical masterwork and rendering the full dramatic impact which Boheme inherently commands but seldom receives. While the entire Company is to be wildly applauded for its superbly realized accomplishment, and with high regard and appreciation for each principal singer's work, special mention must be made of tenor David Hobson (Rodolfo), an electrifying young artist of rare quality. Thrilling sound, intuitively sensitive musicianship, and power to spare, all herein devoted to a brilliant character portrayal. This outstanding talent deserves the international operatic community's recognition and respect for what it is: Top-Drawer. And the Austrailian Opera Company deserves more of the world's recognition and respect for having brought us this beguiling wonderment of a production. Yeah!",951350400,26,1466,6.052884615384615
