The storyline made no sense.  The chicks were ugly and fat.  I think the producer has a fat girl fetish, as he seems to exploit fatty's by making them believe they can become models.  Anyway...don't waste your time with piece of trash.",1438732800,,395,4.63768115942029
8687064,5,B00P9IMHPE,"Microcinema at its best.  I like to give credit where credit is due: This regionally shot independent movie kept me guessing! Really had no idea who the bad guy was until the very end.

Only con: The audio wasn't the best in some scenes where the actors turned their backs to the camera.

If you like 'em bloody and somewhat disturbing, this will be your cup of tea. Can't wait to see what these folks can do with a bigger budget.",1426291200,2,430,4.283950617283951
8687065,5,B00P9IMHPE,"Set in a rural area of Western Kentucky this seemingly endless plot reveals twists and turns that at one point I thought was similar in style to Pulp Fiction.  But just as I thought that I was riveted back in my seat and jolted into reality with the Grindhouse scenes that added some color to this film.  The film has a plot that leaves you guessing up until the very end.  The film is short, held my interest, and I enjoyed it as something different from traditional high-dollar budget films.  This was a work of someone with a true interest in making an effort at something different.  The sound could be a bit better but I'm not complaining for less than $10.  Thank you James Magnum Cook for this production.",1415923200,3,712,4.438461538461539
