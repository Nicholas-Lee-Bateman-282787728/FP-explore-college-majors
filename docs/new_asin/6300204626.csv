7804703,3,6300204626,"WARNING SPOILERS! This is just another one of those ""horny kids trapped in a closed department store while a crazed killer picks them off one-by-one"" film. Director Skip Schoolnik (who produced and directed episodes of the TV series ANGEL [1999 - 2004] and edited many TV movies) goes through the paces setting up red herrings and stupid horny teenager situations along the way. There's much nudity and simulated sex as well as some tense moments (dig that realistic decapitation by elevator that can only be seen in the Unrated Edition, effects courtesy of Screaming Mad George), but the sad fact is that there's too much cheese on this sandwich and not enough meat, not to mention a denouement that would set GLAAD back fifty years. There are some good points to this film: The acting is decent, the effects are professional and the music (by John Ross) does set the right mood. The bad points are that this is no different than hundreds of films of the period that kill kids for having sex, being someplace that they are not supposed to be and generally acting idiotic. Hey, we've all been there, done that, but most of us are still alive, unlike the participants of these films. Is this film escapist fun? Well, yes, as long as you drink a six pack or toke on a fattie. Just don't expect a mind-blowing experience. Starring Brittain Fry, Rebunkah Jones, George Thomas, Donna Baltron, Scott Fults, Annette Sinclair and Scott Kubay as the killer. A New Star Video Release. Available in both R-Rated and Unrated versions. The only difference in the two versions is a two second shot of the aforementioned decapitation. Also available on DVD & Blu-Ray from Code Red in the R-Rated edition, but this one is in its original aspect ratio. I'm not gonna pass this one by because two seconds is missing.",1510963200,2,1798,4.729299363057325

It's never enough that one company puts a movie out on DVD/BD, let's wait until their license runs out and this OTHER company will pick it up and put it out...AGAIN.

How much money are Kino Lober gonna make from something they are regurgitating? Like when Image Ent re-released ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""She Killed In Ecstasy"" soon after Synapse Films had already saturated the market with their copies.
This is getting ridiculous. So many movies out there that never even saw a VHS release back in the day and this is the best we can get? Another re-release!?

Of course there will be the snobby Bluray collector who thinks he/she has some kind of entitlement to say ""Well, this one is gonna be better because they re-re-REmastered it"". SHUT. UP.

I guess the Code Red release wasn't enough because there must be 12 million Americans just clamoring to get their hands on this movie....again.",1493251200,2,1037,4.625

7804709,5,6300204626,"I thought the movie was really awesome and shocking in the end. All through the movie I didn't know who the slasher was and then what a surprise. Those unsuspecting teens had no idea what evil lurked in the shadows of the furniture store in the middle of the night. All of the actors were very talented, especially Scott Kubay. The movie was really scary and one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.",1287360000,4,404,4.4
7804710,4,6300204626,"Hide and Go Shriek was suprisingly good of its type. Like Friday the 13th and its zillions of imitators, this film centers on a group of teens interested in the usual booze and sex. Gratuitious nudity is no treat for female viewers, but if you can look past it you'll find an atmospheric entertaining film. The Furniture Store is chock full of eery looking mannequins and there is a terrifying elevator scene!! Its different and pretty good for horror fans.",977443200,7,457,4.725
7804711,4,6300204626,"This is one of those movies that a friend and I picked up becuase there was nothing else we hadn't seen, and surprisingly ended up being an extremely entertaining bit of horror!  It adds a slightly original twist by  taking place in a multi-floored furniture store.  The kids play hide and  seek, and somewhere amongst the dark displays, and mannequins, a killer  stalks them.  The film ratchets the suspense up a notch till it builds to  an admittedly bizarre conclusion.  Highly recommended!",953424000,12,493,4.926829268292683
