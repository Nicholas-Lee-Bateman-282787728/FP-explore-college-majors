7865751,5,6304223250,"With his blocky, pug-ugly features and slightly-going-soft bodybuilder physique, Bernal is most often relegated to villains' roles in low budget Mexican exploitation films, playing murderous cyborgs, bloodthirsty Satanists and the like. But here, for once, he gets to play the hero, the titular character, Chano. (It's likely not a coincidence that Bernal also directed the film.)

At the risk of being un-PC or even offensive (and to quote from ""Tropic Thunder"") Bernal, in this role, goes ""full-on retard."" I'm not talking cuddly Sean Penn in ""Sam I Am"" mentally disabled. I mean, he is quite literally a drooling mental retardate. And not just a little bit of spittle every now and then - we're talking bulldog/St. Bernard quantities of slobber, almost literally foaming at the mouth at times, projectile drooling at bad guys, Old Yeller-type stuff. It must be seen to be disbelieved. He also talks in a high-pitched, sing-songy, 'huh-muh-muh-muh' stereotyped Downs Syndrome jabber that can be more than a little hard to take  (some of his co-stars' discomfort is obvious at times).

So, Chano (Bernal) apparently makes his living picking through garbage, and it's in one of these huge Mexico City trash heaps that he comes across a discarded magazine featuring a gatefold of a scantily-clad Paty (Patricia) Munoz. Naturally, he instantly falls madly in love with her.

Not that I can blame him. Munoz is, indeed, a knock-out, looking like something the Hernandez Brothers might have created in the pages of 'Love & Rockets,' except that she's a real flesh-and-blood woman. She also disdains brassieres (despite her impressive mammarial qualifications - they look like 44DDs, by my eyeball estimate), spending the bulk of the film's running time in a tight white t-shirt and Daisy Dukes (see the cover scan here). Sadly, she does no nudity in this film, though she comes close in an egregious bubble bath scene. (I call it egregious because there's no particular reason for it - but pretty much any excuse to see this woman in the tub is a'ight by me.)

The basic plot, by the way, concerns Munoz's son (instant best friend of Chano!) getting kidnapped by Munoz's douche-y ex-husband, who is (naturally) a drug lord with lots of armed stooges at his command. With Chano's help (and, I mean, who else would you call? certainly not the police!), Munoz then tries to rescue her son...

The movie is by turns violent and somewhat lurid; unashamedly sentimental and loaded with bathos; laughable and titillating - in other words, pretty much what anyone looks for in a Mexican exploitation film.",1303776000,,2593,5.046728971962617
