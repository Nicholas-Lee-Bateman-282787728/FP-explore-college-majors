8085400,4,B000BD1LDQ,Manolito Gafotas is a very famous character in Spain. He is a funny and crazy character who gets in trouble all the time. I enjoyed the Xmas movie very much (and so did my class).,1355961600,,179,4.142857142857143
8085401,1,B000BD1LDQ,I bought this for my classroom because it was described as a Home Alone in Spanish. The movie is unwatchable. It isn't funny or cute. Don't waste your money.,1324771200,,157,4.448275862068965
8085402,4,B000BD1LDQ,"A fast-talking, bespectacled 9-year-old deals with eccentric parents, a younger brother and bullies as the Christmas holiday season approaches.  Sound familiar?  Manolito Gafotas' story is set in Spain, but its humorous kids-eye-view of the holidays makes it a great family film.

An added bonus for multicultural audiences is that the family' Swedish guest promotes a December 25th, Santa oriented celebration, but Three Kings Day, the holiday traditionally honored in Spanish-speaking countries is also included.  In between the two celebrations, Grandpa's  New Year's Eve prank puts the whole town in an uproar.

The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.",1229385600,13,662,5.636363636363637
