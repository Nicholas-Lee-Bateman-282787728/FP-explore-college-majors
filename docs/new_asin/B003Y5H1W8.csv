8408670,5,B003Y5H1W8,"Very useful class, and easy to follow cueing and instruction - - probably near to intermediate level due to balance poses and length of the practice, but the integrated pelvic work is great.  Most important:  It is a great supplement to a physical therapy regimen to help with pelvic floor difficulties.  Kimberlee has a calm instructional style; very similar to Zyrka Landwijt if I can provide that comparison.  Well worth the price.",1515196800,,434,4.986111111111111

8408676,5,B003Y5H1W8,"I really enjoyed this DVD as both a yoga practitioner and also a RYT (registered yoga teacher/PT. Yes, it is a more basic practice that does layer yoga poses with pelvic floor exercises (kegels, quick flicks, holds, elevator, and other exercises you would get from a prenatal class or dr) ---yet as a busy person I don't always have the luxury to do an hour of yoga and my pelvic floor exercises each day. This is a great way to get both in. The teacher/instructor is straightforward, holds multiple certifications and has a PhD in kinesiology or exercise physiology. If you are pregnant, this DVD is appropriate for all trimesters and also wonderful for both the advanced or novice practitioner. If you are looking for a more advanced prenatal vinyasa flow DVD to compliment this I recommend Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga by Jennifer More. If you are looking for a complimentary pelvic floor routine for anyone (non yoga), check out hab it pelvic floor DVD. I would definitely recommended this as an additional yoga/pelvic practice for your library. Even as power vinyasa flow being my preferential style, I appreciate the change in my routine and an option for the days I want a more basic practice geared towards pelvic health.",1407024000,9,1222,4.851674641148326
8408677,3,B003Y5H1W8,"This dvd is a basic, bare bones production with traditional yoga poses with ""Kegal-like"" exercises included at the same time to strengthen the  pelvic floor.  It was a little too long for me.  If it was 20-30 minutes or had a quick and long version, it would be better.  I also discovered that I can't do some of the ""poses"" as it causes neck/shoulder issues for me.  I have another yoga dvd for neck and shoulder pain (by Gary Kraftsow), and I think if I take the pelvic exercises from this dvd and try to add them in to my neck and shoulder dvd, it will be a better fit for me.  That being said, I will probably try to use this dvd on occasion, when I have enough time, and just modify the poses so as not to strain my neck/shoulders.  I think there is value here and would recommend it to women who have ""itty, bitty bladder syndrome"" or are post-hysterectomy, like me who need to re-hab the pelvic muscles.",1357948800,8,910,4.255813953488372
8408678,5,B003Y5H1W8,Excellent yoga routine for strengthening the pelvic floor. Instructions are very clear and easy to follow and can easily be done by a someone who has had little or no previous yoga experience.,1321315200,11,192,4.848484848484849
