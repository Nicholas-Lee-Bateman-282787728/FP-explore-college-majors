8730902,5,B014IP2S8E,A woman has the right to be informed about the real risks and benefits to what is being done to her body and child.  This film shows how one very important option is being demonized by the medical establishment.  Doctors and midwives have to continue to be trained so that woman have all the safe options open to them.  Women have the right to do what is healthiest for them and their babies!  Thank you for making this documentary and bringing this topic to the public.  A woman shouldn't have to do things that are less safe and healthy because of lack of information and lack of doctors and midwives training.,1515196800,,612,4.4774774774774775
8730903,5,B014IP2S8E,"Important and necessary film; very accessible and well done. I highly recommend it for every OB/GYN and family medicine physician, every midwife, every doula, every childbirth educator, and for the library of every hospital OB unit and every birth center. When you think of the huge variety of other birth films available, why do we have so little on vaginal breech birth? With this film, the producers have taken a step toward teaching the art and skill of vaginal breech birth to the current and future generations, and done much to educate the childbearing public.",1457222400,,567,4.978947368421053
8730904,5,B014IP2S8E,"Thank you so much Dr Elliot Berlin and Dr Stuart Fishbein, Gail Tully and all the contributors to this film.  Informed choice is what helps us to make conscious decisions as parents. These decisions we can live with in a peaceful way.  Looking back and knowing we made the very best decision at the time we made it because we knew what we could know at the time - that is what helps us live with our decisions.  This movie by Dr Elliot Berlin gives woman the information they need to schedule their C-section with confidence OR confidently plan their vaginal breech delivery.  Take away vaginal breech delivery and take away vaginal delivery - ""Gail Tully"" We all need to provide women with choice, Michele Sayball, ND, CPM Kauai, HI",1457222400,,733,4.615384615384615
8730905,5,B014IP2S8E,This was very informative.  It's important for women to know their options and to be able to find a provider that will help them with the option they see fit for their family.  Thank you for making this film.  The greatest part is being able to witness a vaginal breech birth!,1457222400,,276,4.372549019607843

8730907,5,B014IP2S8E,"This film is so well done and really discusses the lost art of delivering breech babies. I highly recommend this video to anyone. Mothers should know that they have a choice and this short film helps them start that conversation with their providers. While not every breech is a good candidate for a vaginal delivery, many are. seek an ob trained in this lost art.",1457222400,,364,4.615384615384615
8730908,5,B014IP2S8E,"Concise and accurate, this film is necessary for transforming our fear based culture of birth. Real women, real stories. Vaginal breech birth is an option women deserve. Elliot Berlin has done an awesome job creating awareness of this issue through this film. Highly recommend.",1457222400,,277,5.318181818181818
8730909,5,B014IP2S8E,"Wonderful film; short & to the point!!  A must-see for all women having babies...to advocate for themselves to their practitioners!  It should be required viewing for all doctors who attend births all over the globe, and especially here in the U.S.! We must ""Reteach Breech"" education!  Breech is NOT necessarily a scary way to give birth, it is just not taught anymore!  Kudos to Informed Pregnancy for continuing the conversation!",1457222400,,432,5.128571428571429
8730910,5,B014IP2S8E,Just finished watching this with a live chat with the producers. This is great introduction into the reason vaginal breech birth is not an option in most of the US and starts the discussion on how to bring it back.,1457222400,,214,4.375
8730911,5,B014IP2S8E,"As a doula and childbirth educator in Sacramento, I highly recommend this film! There are beautiful births shown in all their breech glory and an excellent addition to any childbirth educator's stash of invaluable resources.",1457222400,,224,5.428571428571429
