7753533,3,B01G24WHCQ,"A House Is Not a Home is an interesting spin on the haunted house horror sub-genre. Alcoholism and an affair have left Ben and Linda Williams (Gerald Webb, Diana Nicole Baxter) struggling to save their marriage. Figuring a fresh start is best for them and their kids, they move to a new town and into a dream home. None of the family members can shake the feeling that something isn't quite right in their new home, and their fears are realized when things inside the house take a supernatural and sinister turn. They try to flee but an ancient evil traps them in the houses ever-changing labyrinth. The family must pull together as never before to fight for their lives.

Veteran actor Bill Cobbs (Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb) plays real estate agent Paul, a fellow with a pleasant smile who may just have a hidden agenda of his own.

The idea of a haunted house with a mind or spirit of its own is a terrifying thought. Director Christopher Ray puts a spin on the genre by making his imperiled family African-American. This might be a first. Typically in horror flicks, the occasional black character is killed early on. This family encounters the same terrors as their white counterparts. There are strange noises, shadowy appearances, an evil entity, and an elaborate series of nooks and crannies where spooky beings can hide. The family confronts the escalating horror realistically and generally avoids cliches.

The horror of claustrophobia is a tried-and-true technique to create tension, and the familys inability to get away amps up the danger. The film shows influences of The Amityville Horror, Poltergeist and The Conjuring but never achieves their caliber.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1475193600,,1739,4.884745762711864
7753534,5,B01G24WHCQ,"Architect adulterer Ben Williams (Gerald Webb) and his alcoholic musician wife Linda (Diahnna Nicole Baxter) move into a large home we know has issues from the brief opening scene. The kids Alex (Melvin Gregg) and Ashley (Aurora Perrineau) prefer the days when they were a dysfunctional family. The kids are told at school, ""you're next"" as creepy things happen around the home. The haunting escalates to the point where they call in a Voodoo priest (Eddie Steeples) to exercise the spirits. Things start out good...

Amazon and IMDB description includes material that is near the end of the film, but not really a spoiler. The fun is in the jump scares and creepy stuff...including creepy dolls. It was an enjoyable film. Bill Cobbs did a nice job.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1474761600,2,783,4.879699248120301

7753538,1,B01G24WHCQ,"Not sure how this mess has an average rating of four stars.  Ridiculous!  For some reason there are not a lot of horror films which feature predominantly black casts so when one like A House is not a Home comes along it catches a reviewers eye with a certain level of interest. Unfortunately, this amateurish, low-budget mess isn't going to be good for anyone. The film proclaims itself as a combination of Amityville Horror and the exorcist which is kind of like the backup forward for Paducah High comparing himself to LeBron James.house

Ben and Linda Williams are shown the home of their dreams by sweet, old real estate salesman, Paul (Bill Cobbs). In a last ditch effort to try and save their troubled marriage they move into the home with their two teenaged children Ashley (Perrineau) and Alex (Gregg). A brief prologue showed how the previous resident played by Richard Greico apparently went crazy and murdered his family, spurred on by some supernatural force in the home.

As soon as they move in they begin to experience various sorts of strange eventsloud pounding on their front door; creepy dolls which appear on Ashleys dresser even after she stuffs them away in a closet; strange shadows that seem to have a life of their own. As in Amityville Horror which Director Christopher Ray desperately tries to channel, the father, Ben, becomes withdrawn and paranoid. He grows obsessed with the weird dining room table that was left behind that has a leathery like surface. In other words its by-the-numbers haunted house fare with some of the worst acting youve ever seen, even by low budget horror film standards. In particular the Perrineau and Gregg are incredibly wooden as the two teens that underreact to the right things and overreact to the wrong things.

The parents find nothing strange in the home having an old rotary dial phone that looks like it came from the 1950s even though the home itself appears to be much more modern. And in the end the phone, as well as an old 1950s style radio, play no part in the films narrative other than the fact that they seem to be two out of place relics.

Eventually the family finds themselves under attack by an evil force. They reach out to a voodoo priest (whom the kids saw on TV) to come to the house and attempt to exorcise the entity. I bet you can guess how well that goes. Not helping matters is the bottom shelf special effects which are not even up to Syfy channel standards. The only real saving grace to A House is not a Home is the all too brief appearances by savvy character actor veteran Bill Cobbs who has nearly 200 credits under his belt and is always enjoyable.

7753544,4,B01G24WHCQ,"I was blessed to go to the Philadelphia Premiere of this movie.  I didn't really know what to expect and just started following Gerald Webb the previous day.  Well, I won tickets to the premiere thanks to Gerald Webb and what a treat.  To see a movie with a predominately cast of colour was refreshing.  It was refreshing because it didn't have any cliches or stereotypes that most horror films have when African American characters are involved.

The movie involves a house that has an interesting energy attached to it.  The sinister real estate agent brilliantly portrayed by Bill Cobb (New Jack City, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb) gives the audience an idea what the families that move into the house are in for.  The movie focuses on the Williams family as they move in and settle into their new home.  Mom and Dad are in a troubled marriage but are trying to work things out.  The teenagers a brother and sister are just trying to adjust into the new surroundings.  It isn't long before the brother and sister realize that the house has a sinister vibe that seeks to destroy the entire family.  Nightmares, visions, and hallucinations start affecting various family members that a spiritualist is called in Eddie Steeples (My Name is Earl) to help the family out and get to the bottom of everything.
A House is not A Home is filled with chills and thrills throughout the movie.  I enjoyed it immensely due to the cast portrayals as well as the effects that made this film quite creepy.  For those who like the Paranormal Activity franchise, they'll find this movie on par with the series.

A House Is Not A Home is definitely not cliche, and was unpredictable enough to keep me riveted. I was delighted to see Bill Cobbs and Eddie Steeples (want. those. contacts.), and of course my favorite, Gerald Webb. I love noticing details, and this movie did not disappoint, from the architectural details to the sound track, every nuance was subtly on cue taking me a different direction just before I was about to assume I could guess the rest of the story. Thankfully, the story didn't linger on explaining unnecessary unknowns, which actually stepped up the tension a little, one example being never finding out which came first, the alcoholism or the cheating, and thus never knowing who really started the hard feelings in the first place, but by the end we can clearly see this attempt at reconciliation was perfect for the kind of ending that twists your mind around until you go Ok, didn't see that Escher thing coming, good one, and then you go ohhhh... wondering if some of what just happened was already other realmy stuff and they just didn't know it. If you're looking for a good Halloween movie (or anytime scary movie) that doesn't just chain yank you around while you play on your phone, this is it, I totally put my phone down for this one. When I first looked for this movie I didn't find it in stores or Netflix, but it's easy to rent or buy through Amazon and YouTube, and everything about it was high quality viewing through my device. I especially loooooved the soundtrack, and I wish I had a house like that. Well, minus the table...",1476921600,,1827,4.99344262295082
