8268368,4,6304896220,"Lightening In A Bottle is an effective drama dealing with the tragedy that befalls ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter's character. The fine acting coupled with inevitably heart tugging situations helps transcend this from common Lifetime movie quality to...well, the better Lifetime movies. One performance that at first might seem a minor detail is that of Kristen Underwood as the emergency room nurse who first tends to Carter- something struck me in this performance; it seemed to contain the sort of acting that goes beyond acting (which, may just be what one witnesses when seeing a good actor practicing their craft). As Lynda Carter comes to and Underwood's image appears one is drawn in to this world, and Wonder Woman quickly becomes Overcoming Disaster and Trauma Woman.",1109030400,,779,5.190476190476191
8268369,5,6304896220,"Lynda Carter gives a very moving performance as an amnesia victim struggling to regain her lost memories. It is wonderful to see Ms. Carter in a role that really enables her to make full use of her dramatic acting  skills. The friendship that develops between Charlotte and Jean (Lynda  Carter and Dee Wallace Stone) is very touching.  Even when Jean discovers  the truth about the accident, true friendship still prevails.  This movie,  along with A PRAYER IN THE DARK are 2 of Lynda Carter's best movies.  I  highly recommend both of them.",940723200,7,541,4.804347826086956
