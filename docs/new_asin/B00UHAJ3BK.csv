Each of the 3 story lines had a central figure that kept me  interested and on the edge of my seat, wondering what would be the outcome of their situation. The acting was just fine and the characters were well developed. If you like gun fights, there are plenty of bullets flying. If you like romance, there is a beautiful love story. If you like to look at life in a place you might not be familiar with, you can find it here.",1533600000,,494,4.145833333333333

8706837,4,B00UHAJ3BK,"the story line was pretty straight forward but the idea of having various floating time s framed in the movie worked well to make a complex story line that was enjoyable to try to keep up with. Complex movie. Would be a good movie to remake with a rewrite of the script. The actors could stay the same. Good scenery, not antiseptic like some but a real Mexico look.",1513123200,,365,4.304347826086956
