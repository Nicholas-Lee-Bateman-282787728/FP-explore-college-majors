This PBS Frontline feature is a one hour episode from the 2014-2015 season and was reported and produced by Safa Al Ahmad.  Though, fight for Yemen roughs out a timeline here and there, the focus is much more on the stories and interviews of locals, fighters, politicians and clerics from both sides.  This allows us to see and interpret the issues and influences that are tearing the country apart.  Despite even personal loss on Safa's part, she remains quite impartial allowing both sides to be heard.  The individual interviews will not be impartial of course, as they express their concerns, political views, stories of conflict, and in some cases hatred or radical ideology.  Safa, a female, is granted surprising access from both Houthi fighters and politicians to Al Qaeda and Sunni separatists.  There is extremely little on the ground reporting from the chaos in Yemen, which makes this 1 hour report even more extraordinary.

COVERAGE: From the northern Houthi (Shia) area of Sa'dah to the southern Sunni and Al Qaeda areas of Ja'ar and Adan - not to mention the capital Sana'a in the middle - Safa al Ahmad negotiated unprecedented access to regions and people in order to bring an issues oriented documentary covering the disintegration of Yemen as it is happening.  She arrives shortly after the 2014 bombing in Tahrir Square and as the Houthi are already in the capital expanding their involvement in the government.  The Houthi rebels already have a shadow government, but to be direct, it has enough upper hand to already be running many aspects.  Safa explains the government fight against both Houthis and Sunni separatists including Al Qaeda.  She does a little back track explaining the Zaidi rule of Yemen over a millennia that is part of the Houthi origin.  We travel north to places like Sa'dah as she interviews fighters, locals and politicians to explore the Shia Houthi perspective.  Following that, Safa uses film and interview footage from two trips to Sunni territory.  Part from a trip she made 3 years prior, and part from her trip in 2014.  In this she explores the Sunni perspective and even interviews Al Qaeda fighters.  These fighters do tend to be more guarded in some cases.  Behind all this is the backdrop of Yemen countryside and rubbled towns.

Though there is certainly discussion of Saudi, Iranian, and even U.S. interest in the conflict, these portions are kept to a minimum as local individual and militia concerns come more to the front.  For those who do not study the middle east, this program can still stand alone in explaining the problems in Yemen which have had little coverage until lately.  It will even explain a little why that conflict offers complexities that confound outside interests.  For those who do study the region, it is even more apparent how Yemen can be very contradictory and complex in its presentation of interests and repercussions of different outcomes.  There is 0 mention of U.S. politics as that is not the focus of this program.  Little pointing of fingers outside the country, though Saudi involvement and support for the Yemen government against Houthis is mentioned.  Safa allows the story to mostly tell itself and ties it together in the end with mentions of this instability having consequences for both the Middle East and the U.S.  - There is no time in the single hour to discuss how the instability can export trouble elsewhere so Safa doesn't really explain her final comments there.  However, if you listen to individual comments from fighters on both sides it does become apparent there are violent aspirations on the part of some elements.  Iranian involvement is also hardly touched.  The part that is touched is a disavowment of direct support from Houthis, though they do borrow some slogans and ideology directly from the older Iranian revolution.

FINAL THOUGHTS;  There are some surprising elements from this short program as somewhat moderate voices are also heard.  There is also a part where Safa's friend drives her car in her local neighborhood, which you might think dangerous for a woman.  At first they pretend to drive, then they actually take it out as they discuss issues on camera.  Though only so much can be covered in this 1 hour program, there are some Q & A clips with Safa on the PBS Frontline webpage (Amazon does not allow posting external links so I can't give that here).  She explains how Yemen Shia ideology has important differences from Iranian Shia despite borrowing the Iranian slogans.  How sectarianism is just a tool being used by political factions for gain is discussed.  She also explains how a lack of reporting out of Yemen contributed to the sparse knowledge of the Houthi and their actions until now.  I found the Q & A clips very useful after watching this program.  Generally there were maps indicating regions as she discussed them.  However, occasionally a province or town will be mentioned with no reference to an audience that has little orientation to the country.  The general timeline could have been defined a little more also, but that is not the focus and there just isn't time to be comprehensive.  This is a tale that is yet unfinished.  Its repercussions yet to be realized.",1434153600,2,5365,4.907880133185349
