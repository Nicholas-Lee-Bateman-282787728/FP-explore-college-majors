8289279,5,B001CU7M9O,This is a highly entertaining documentary. It is both serious & comical at the same time. It covers a subject that not too many people think of when they think about the Civil War. I highly recommend it because it will keep your attention from beginning to end.,1258243200,4,261,4.458333333333333
