8146654,5,B000IOMY8Y,"Great DVD! Catchy lyrics, danceable tunes, and pure fun!",1427673600,,56,5.333333333333333
8146655,5,B000IOMY8Y,Worked as intended.,1416182400,,19,5.666666666666667
8146656,3,B000IOMY8Y,"Love love LOVE 'Tasha B's music and I have 3 of her cd's but I thought this dvd was boring and a bit amateur-ish, she is a super star and an awesome vocalist no doubt, but I guess I wanted the dvd to be more special, possibly different arrangements on some of her songs, more visual effects etc., anything that could be considered ""extras"" that didn't make me feel like I was literally watching a live performance of her cd. I would have just bought a live cd of hers instead of getting the dvd if I knew this would be the case.
Still love her music though!",1293148800,,557,4.166666666666667
8146657,5,B000IOMY8Y,"This live version of the ""Unwritten"" album is one of the finest music DVDs around. Period. The album speaks for itself...great [and clean] lyrics, sung in an absolutely gorgeous, clear voice. You can understand every word, and you're actually glad you can.....she's a ""Bomb"", ""Single"", ""Bruises Easily"", and is an ""Unwritten"" work in progress...and it's all fabulous.

As to the visual side...a pretty girl can be sexy, even sexual, and still not seem trashy. Natasha wears an outfit that is sexy, without crossing any lines. You'll thoroughly enjoy it, and not even have to feel guilty.

The technical aspect is perfect...camera work, instrumental back-up, sound production...everything a fan can ask. This was a superb concert, that Natasha and her audience obviously enjoyed. Well they should have. Grab this fantastic DVD, and you can, too.",1212883200,,844,5.291044776119403
8146658,5,B000IOMY8Y,"Easily one of the best concert dvd's, Natasha puts on a show second to none. Her voice is amazing as she passionately sings each song. There are many times she sounds like Pink, which is a huge compliment from me, but I think her songs are better than Pink's. My favorites are These Words, Single, Silent Movie, The Scientist and of course Unwritten. The bonus features are nice, too. Great buy at just 12.99.",1188345600,2,409,4.54054054054054
8146659,5,B000IOMY8Y,"Although I have not yet seen this DVD, I have seen Natasha Bedingfield in concert.  In October 2005, Natasha performed an intimate, acoustic set at a local music store.  I was lucky enough to get a spot in the first row, which meant that I was about five feet away from Natasha.  She sounded amazing, and she interacted very well with the audience.  After her performance, Natasha graciously signed autographs for everyone in the store.  One of the local radio stations sponsored the concert, and the DJ's kept telling us that we were not allowed to get our picture taken with her.  We could take pictures of her, but that was it.  To the delight of everyone at the store, Natasha chose to ignore this rule.  When it was my turn to get an autograph and picture, I was starstruck.  In addition to being absolutely gorgeous, she is actually very nice.  Most of the audience members were female, and I can understand why.  Natasha is a positive role model for women of any age, and I highly recommend seeing her in concert if you ever get the chance.

If ""Live in New York City"" is even half as good as the performance I saw in 2005, you will not be disappointed.",1163548800,3,1160,4.4454976303317535
8146660,5,B000IOMY8Y,I live in the UK and have pre-ordered this item. I absolutly love Natasha and her music. I cant wait to watch the 2 hour live performance and the 2 hour assortment of bonus features. It truly will be a explosive dvd to remember. I also can't wait for her 2nd album out March 2007 in UK!,1162684800,3,286,4.035087719298246
