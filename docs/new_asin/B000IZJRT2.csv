The story is a bit different, I enjoyed the subtle humor and think the young actors did a great job. I would watch this movie over and over again for the cheese factor :)",1250035200,,354,3.9859154929577465
8148180,4,B000IZJRT2,"Socha Na Tha is about a free-spirited unsettled hindu boy (Abhay Deol - cousin of Bobby, Sunny, Esha and Ahana) who has had a Christian girlfriend (Apoorva Jha) he hasn't told his folks about. They want him to marry and take him to meet a girl of their choice (Ayesha Takia). Boy and girl hit it off but arrange that the boy discard her so he can be with the other girl. However they bump into each other and continue the friendship till it deepens. By then everything has become confused and there's been an engagement arranged to the Christian girl he no longer loves. In all the confusion the new young lovers parents are angry at each other and really 'over' their original choice of partners (which of course would have been these 2 in the beginning)... even trying to give a summary of the plot is confusing!
Now the 2 leads are excellent and there's good chemistry between them (overlooking the actual 10 year age difference as they are meant to be similar in age!). I have seen Ayesha before and she is always OK but I'll be watching Abhay in future as he is a cut above the usual.
I would have marked it even higher but I still have 'Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na' and 'Bommarillu', both also about young love , resounding in memory. These other 2 were so much the 5 stars and included some memorable music that this one lacked. So I put this at a respectable 4. This isn't a movie with dance numbers and the music is of the quieter sweeter kind. However there were no 'hooks' in the melodies to recall them later so, while OK, it didn't rate as highly for me.
I recently saw this movie voted as one of the most underrated movies as it has quite wide acceptance after it failed to impress at box office- and the Indian critics weren't always kind to it. The West may have warmed to it more as I see on IMDb it was rating at a fairly consistent 8 out of 10 in all age-groups, and out of over 500 votes. A keeper",1244419200,,1913,4.258241758241758
