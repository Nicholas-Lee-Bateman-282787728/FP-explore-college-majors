477835,5,630251004X,"Whatever you've thought of this movie previously, I think I can safely say that after viewing this DVD you will really appreciate this film. The transfer is incredible; the supplements contain a wealth of fascinating  information that can only enhance your estimation of this movie. To me this  is clearly the best of the Roger Moore entries, featuring a harder edged  Bond who doesn't rely on gadgets. The locations and stunts are some of the  best in the whole series and John Glen's direction is top notch. Most  highly recommended.",940550400,,535,4.9
477836,5,630251004X,"Moore was always too campy, and the idea that he was an agent with a license to kill seemed always ridiculous to me watching Moore's antics.  At least until For Your Eyes Only.
This film marks the Bond series' return  to reality after silly flights of fancy like Moonraker, with Bond caught in  a blood feud between two Greek smuglers while trying to keep a top secret  missle launching system out of enemy hands.
Topol and Julian Glover are  terrific as the two Greek smugglers, and Carole Bouquet is the most  stunningly beautiful Bond girl of the 80's.  Bill Conti's score is bad, but  not distractingly bad like Serra's score from Goldeneye.
The DVD is out  of sight!! 2 audio commentaries, 4 trailers, a new 1/2 hour documentary on  the making of the film, a pristine transfer, and a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix  that, with the right equipment, blows the doors off!  You must have this  disc!!",940550400,2,892,4.6050955414012735

477838,5,630251004X,"After the debatable qualities of ""Moonraker,"" Bond comes back to earth in ""For Your Eyes Only."" Roger Moore's most realistic Bond, it is also one of Moore's finest, second only to ""The Spy Who Loved  Me.""  When an undercover British ship is sunk, countries around the  globe rush to grab the ATAC unit that is on board.  Bond's mission is to  keep it from falling into the wrong hands.  Bond Girl Carol Bouquet and  possible villains Topol and Julian Glover make ""Eyes"" a highly  entertaining thriller, and certainly one of Moore's most engaging.  The  score is adequate, with several very good instrumental pieces.  Highlights  include the pre-credits sequence, Bond being pursued on a ski slope, and  Bond dangling precariously from the side of a cliff as one of the villain's  henchmen hammers out the supports holding his rope.  As for the fate of the  ATAC, it's not what you would expect.",912124800,2,894,4.821192052980132

478072,5,630251004X,"For Your Eyes Only (1981) stars Roger Moore as 007, and while it has its share of camp (common with Moore's portrayal of Bond), it's still an entertaining movie. There is action aplenty, and the Bond girl is one of the best in the film series. I also liked the settings, as they're picturesque. Now......the music is sort of goofy (like something out of a late 70's television show), and the movie as a whole has that feel in many parts. Humorous?  Yes.  Distracting? Not really. Moore was always the less serious Bond, but knows when to be serious when the situation calls for it. For Your Eyes Only is a solid entry in the 007 series, but nowhere near the best. I actually give this movie 4.5 stars, but don't want to round down; I'll round up this time, giving it the benefit of the doubt. This movie was supposed to come after The Spy Who Loved Me, but Moonraker was made instead to appease the Star Wars crowd, as sci-fi was making a comeback. That's too bad, because this movie would've probably been rated higher as a late 70's release. The special features are interesting and nice to have.",1483833600,,1098,4.45771144278607

478080,2,630251004X,"I can't believe how many good reviews there are for this one, right now it sits at 4.5 stars which is higher than You Only Live Twice and other Bond movies that I consider to be far superior. Moore is old, and if he already wasn't exciting enough (and he really wasn't) his performance here is very uninspired, almost as if he is just going through the motions.

The theme song is poorly dated, and makes you want to fall asleep before the movie even starts. While the Bond girl (Carole Bouquet) is pretty, she isn't nearly enough to save this entry in the dying Moore-era Bond. Once again we are stuck with the Lotus as Bond's vehicle, and without any consequence or particular speciality.

The shaky cam cinematography during the action scenes, extremely cheesy stunt work and poor special effects make this one pretty difficult to watch. If that isn't enough Bond's relationship with what seems like a teenage girl is almost as uncomfortable as Lynn-Holly Johnson seems when she's trying to act. On top of all that the villain offers nothing unique to set himself apart from the rest.

478235,5,630251004X,"For Your Eyes Only is actually my second-favourite Bond film, although I still maintain that 'The Spy Who Loved Me' is the best of the Moore films.
Even though it is my second-favourite Bond movie there are still a few seriously terrible bits, notably the pre-title sequence and the final scenes, with a ridiculous Mrs Thatcher impersonation and a parrot, a rather disco-y soundtrack and a quite forgettable theme tune sung by Sheena Easton (who is the only singer to date to actually appear on screen during the title credits.....why though is still a mystery). Over-look those however, and the rest of the film is terrific.
Bond is essentially back to basics, and uses his wits and skill throughout the film rather than relying on Q's gadgets. Following the murder of marine archeologist Timothy Havelock, who was hired by MI6 to locate the ATAC machine from a sunken British spy ship, Bond is assigned to discover who killed him and to retrieve the ATAC before it falls into the hands of the Russians.
There's a couple of stand-out chase scenes, following Bond's gadget laiden Lotus being destroyed, he's left to take the wheel of a Citroen 2CV for the car chase, and the later ski chase is pretty fast-paced too. While we still get the occassional trademark Moore quips these are dramatically toned down and there is a much more serious and edgier performance, this is especially highlighted in a brilliant scene which sees the villian's henchman in his car hanging precariously on the edge of a cliff, and Bond vengefully and cold-bloodedly kick the car over the edge (this was followed by a quip, but it marked a brutal change in Moore's portrayal of Bond for this film).
Stunning French actress Carole Bouquet plays Melina Havelock, a strong willed woman who is out for revenge following the death of her parents. Learning that her parents are connected in the mission Bond is assigned to, she teams up with Bond to avenge her parents death and help him locate the ATAC device.
As for the villian, well the film does not establish a clear villain until some way into it's running time. Initially we are led to believe that Milos Columbo (played by Topol), the pistachio chomping former partner of Aristotle Kristatos is the man behind the death of the Havelocks however it turns out to be misinformation as Kristatos is in fact the man behind the killings and has been working with the KGB to obtain the ATAC system. Kristatos is portrayed brilliantly, and much more low-key than previous 'world-dominating' wannabe villians of previous films, by Julian Glover.
With great locations including Corfu and Cortina D'Ampezzo in Italy, For Your Eyes Only is a satisfying and thrilling entry in the series.",1465430400,,2707,4.861471861471862

478238,4,630251004X,"Roger Moore was getting long in the tooth when he reprised his role of Agent 007 in 1981's FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. But he still had enough in him to make his bit of skullduggery convincing. This time out, he's tasked with tracking down a British spy ship what's sunken somewhere at the bottom of the Ionian Sea. But he's not the only one in on this salvage operation as global superpowers scramble to be first in snagging the wreck's highly coveted cargo: The ATAC (Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator), the missile command system that directs the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines to launch their ballistic missiles. To get the job done, Cdr. Bond ends up tangling with warring Greek operators, Soviet agents, Cuban hitmen, a pretend Countess, a randy figure skater, and an intoxicating half-Greek beauty rarin' to avenge her parents' deaths. And it's not an empty revenge mission, mind you. This seething girl, Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet), exhibits mad skills with the crossbow. Who knows, before it's all over, she may even save 007's life. At least twice.

This movie makes me want to drive my canary yellow Citron 2CV to the gun range and shoot my Walther PTK (standard issue for Her Majesty's Secret Service). FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is the twelfth entry in the James Bond series, and the fifth to star Roger Moore. After the over-the-top sci-fi silliness of MOONRAKER (1979), a decision was made to hearken back to the franchise's more realistic, gritty roots. While Moore will always be regarded as one of the lighter, more playful Bonds, he does ease up on the quips and gets down to serious business more readily. That's what a heavy revenge plot tends to do, makes all stabs at playing silly buggers seem puerile and off-tone.

The movie suffers from an absence of a memorable villain - I'm not counting Blofeld's bit in the pre-opening credits sequence. Thankfully, that lack is rectified by solid performances from the cast. Topol seems to be having the time of his life as the likable scoundrel Milos Columbo. And Carole Bouquet, with her stunning looks, must rank loftily in that catalogue of sexy Bond girls. Also, Melina Havelock is surely one of the more capable and lethal damsels to ever cross paths with 007.

The stunts are quality stuff. I enjoyed the action sequences, starting with the pre-opening credits sequence. My favorite, though, is hands down the scene in which Bond and Melina are trussed up together and dragged by a motor boat thru treacherous waters inhabited by sharks. Equally harrowing: Bond gets trapped in a plummeting remote-controlled whirlybird; is chased thru the precarious terrain of Corfu, Spain while steering Melina's cute canary yellow Citron 2CV; has a simply awful skiing experience on the Alps; and must storm the enemy's aerie stronghold. Cue also the occasional passionate embrace, although even that is toned down some. Couple all that good stuff with a chart-topping, mood-setting Sheena Easton jam and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY gets as close as this sneaking-up-on-senior-citizen-status version of Moore can get to emulating the no-nonsense thrills provided by Sean Connery and even by Moore himself when he first took on this role.",1465084800,,3192,4.98499061913696

478533,4,630251004X,"Fore Your Eyes Only is an often overlooked entry into Roger Moores time as 007 James Bond.  It came after the wildly cheesy but successful Moonraker and before Octopussy which was excellent until the final battle scene with the airplane.  This is the one Bond film that I could never seem to watch at the beginning of the movie.  I have seen it so many times half way through or almost over.  I finally was able to see the whole thing from start to finish on a Hulu Bond marathon. I think the director wanted to get back to reality after Moonraker and focus on the actual character and spy elements.  Seeing James visit his wife's grave at the beginning is a strong moment because you rarely see that side of Bond.

The plot is actually pretty strong and as a spy movie it is very good.  I would actually rank this 2nd behind The Spy Who Loved Me as Roger Moores best Bond movie.  The beginning opening is obviously a throwback to the Blofeld character somehow alive and confined to a wheelchair still trying to kill Bond.  I thought the opening was actually very well done.  Compare it to the newest Bond film Spectre for a nice comparison between old and new.

Although I think Sean Connery is actually a better Bond I grew up watching far more Roger Moore Bond films than I ever did Connery films.  Fore Your Eyes Only has a lot of good underwater work with mini subs and diving suites but is much different than say Thunderball.  The skiing chase scenes at the Olympic complex are really exciting as well.

Everything about the movie really works and comes together nicely.  I doubt Bond could be duped so easily by the double cross of the main villain especially if someone is trying to kill him every couple of minutes.  Seeing the old Lotus sports cars is pretty neat as well if you are a car fan.

The cliff climbing and final climax of the film is unique as well.  This was at a time when Roger was still youthful and did not look to old for the role of 007 like in A View to a Kill.  Rarely do many people talk about this film in the 007 catalog and it is a shame because it is a good one.  The movie is definitely worth watching I would rate it 4 stars.",1447200000,,2164,4.27027027027027
478534,4,630251004X,"The chases are incredible, car chase thru countryside down a mountain! and ski chase on a mountain and throw is a couple of motorcycles, then put them on a bobsled course! The lady Bond assists can carry on her own and then some, pretty handy with a crossbow. Then there is the Cold War backdrop, still a spy vs. spy tale of espionage, nuclear deterrence under threat. Good villain's, cold blooded killers, ruthless, but Bond outwits them, has help from Q as usual and his ally in Greek underworld. The ending is a crackup with Bond blowing off his boss, PM for some personal time and giving them the ""bird"" instead, not what you think. Clever scriptwriting! Outrageous stunts!",1446422400,,677,4.697478991596639

478569,5,630251004X,"For Your Eyes Only was the first (and, until now, one of the only) James Bond film that I saw in the movie theatre, when I was a young teenager, and I just enjoyed it so much. It was funny, it had action, it had a sympathetic antihero next to Bond, and lovely ladies. Nice!

Now, as an adult, I've watched the DVD series all the way through to this one, taking in all of the bonus features and learning about the evolution of the film series. I still love the film! Concocted from a few short stories, it's similar to a few other Bond films (notably The Spy Who Loved Me) that took titles from Bond films but little else, adding a bit here and a bit there, pillaging from old Bond series ideas (especially You Only Live Twice and The Spy Who Loved Me). But For Your Eyes Only does something a bit different, by stripping away the bombast that had simply been escalating and escalating all the way up to Moonraker, which was Eon Productions' attempt to out-do Star Wars in terms of lasers and explosions. Nutso.

For Your Eyes Only has modest scenes, simple explosions, and a few engaging characters. The gizmos are simple (guns, bows and arrows), and Q hardly has anything to do. The film is also the first without M, who died just before principal photography could begin. The story builds up a nice little revenge plot or two, not really the usual part of the story up till now in the series, unless you take Honey Rider's tarantula trick seriously. But a few things are familiar, like the underwater scenes filmed in the Bahamas, again (it's supposed to be Greece).

The story moves along quickly, with military secrets compromised, Bond called onto the scene, a revenge killing, a wild rural village road getaway in a crappy car, Italian alps shenanigans, Bond meeting his local contact Luigi Ferrara, who indulges in every spy movie cliche ever invented (and thus parodied in Top Secret!). Cool bobsled track races, Bong smiling wrily at the bobsledders, more casino shenanigans, a countess on a beach, nutty assassination attempts, raids on heroin smugglers (great action), the mystery unravels, a great car showdown on a cliff with killer Locque, sexy underwater scenes with Bond and Melina (played by one of the most gorgeous Bond girls ever, Carole Bouquet), and then a fun raid on the villain's mountain fortress (filmed at Meteora in Greece) and an encounter with our old friend, KGB spymaster Gogol. Nice use of a dot matrix printer in the film, and lots of nipples too! ""We can't be sure for certain!""

The song is also amazing, and there's plenty of backlit (and frontlit!) nudity in the opening credits sequence as Sheena Easton sings ""For Your Eyes Only"". Nice.

The film comes with tons and tons of bonus features. Declassified: MI6 Vault included deleted scenes and expanded angles. ""Hockey 007 Style"" (1:54) adds a snow dumping to the hockey ""game"" Bond plays with his would-be ice rink assassins, all with John Glen commentary. ""Joining Forces""  (0:44) provides extra-corny commentary by Melinda about Bond's sex life (so what?). Then there's the ""Bond In Greece"" documentary (5:55). ""After Moonraker we thought that we'd bring James Bond back to Earth and make the films more realistic."" Behind the scenes shots in Greece. Cassandra Harris in film, brought husband Pierce Brosnan, who was a struggling actor at the time. Meteora. Brought back Rick Sylvester from the Mt Asgard stunt of The Spy Who Loved Me. Tale of minks' dispute in Meteora, when they put up sheets to spoil any shots that were taken, they wanted more money. Towns folk wanted to storm the monastery! ""Bond in Cortina"" (4:17), with the yak boots!! Snow trucked in. ""Neptune's of the Deep"", National Geographic, Cameron's The Abyss and Titanic. The sub was used to publicise the film, and we get a history of the prop.

007 Mission Control, with all of the thematic clippings from the film, this whole section is quite clunky and useless, but the ""Exotic Locations"" featurette (4:58) is okay, as it shows extra scenes of the UK, the Bahamas, Greece, Italy, and the derelict Beckton Gasworks (which was also used in Full Metal Jacket).

Mission Dossier - ""Inside For Your Eyes Only"" (20:45). Plot incorporated hijacking sequence from Live And Let Die into short stories ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Risicol"". Maibaum and Michael Wilson wrote the screenplay. Julian Glover was great as a heavy - there had was once been talk of making him a Bond, but he was too young at the time. Serendipity - Dana Broccoli found Topol at a party and realised he'd be perfect as Columbo. The script shows links to the past - and so, instead of a throwaway scene with a bimbo, the opener shows Bond at his dead wife's grave, a rare Bond film link to the past. One of the extras at the assassin's party, Tula, had been born a man. Bond more reliant on his wits in this film, less reliant on gizmos. Pictures of Moore smoking in 1981, a decade after he'd supposedly quit! When the neighbouring monks protested, the crew built their own monastery on a Meteora rock. John Glen's signature motif - someone startled by pigeons. Carole Bouquet could not do underwater scenes due to her sinuses, so they filmed the scene dry in slo-mo with fans and added shimmering water effects - it worked! Skater Lynn Holly Johnson, not the greatest actress, was good fun as a full-grown woman here sharing her memories - ""Oh, Roger... he is a madman. He's just a nut!"" Willy Bogner's 3rd stint as stunt ski director. This time he even wrote sequences. The documentary has a cool jazzy theme music at the end and over the credits, and laughing at the end - something different! ""Animated storyboard sequence - snowmobile chase"" (1:14), with its horrible music, showed an earlier version of the film's development (later they used snow motorcycles). ""Animated story board sequence - underwater"" (1:47), Music video (2:45) with its total nudity!!

Ministry of Propaganda - ""Theatrical archive"" simply has one theatrical trailer (2:07). Ah! What more do you need? TV broadcast's ""For Your Eyes Only TV Trailer"" (3:55), with breathy female narration: ""No one comes close to 007 when 007 comes close to you."" ""For Your Eyes Only Second TV Trailer"" (3:55) is near-identical to the first. ""TV Teaser Trailer"" (3:54). Then there's the Radio Communications - Bond, James Bond"" (0:33). ""When it comes to action..."" (0:34), ""Mr Bond! Mr Bond!! Mr Bond!!!"" (0:34).

478717,4,630251004X,"The Roger Moore era of James Bond films gets knocked more than it deserves. Recently I viewed Moore's 1981 Bond title FOR YOUR EYES ONLY for the first time in three decades and almost all of it seemed new after all these years. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY's strength is in its characters, especially the roles played so well by Carole Boquet and Topol.  Come to think of it, the best James Bond films (GOLDFINGER, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN) feature strong female leads as opposed to girls who are just there to look good and get rescued (LIVE AND LET DIE), and in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Boquet rocks in her role of the partner Bond does not recruit but should be glad came along when she saves his hide.

As is the case in too many James Bond movies, the FOR YOUR EYES ONLY action sequences (the car chase; the ski chase) and the fights (no bruises after how many blows?) get ridiculous.  But on the whole the good story, interesting characters and fine acting by Boquet, Moore, and Topol are more than enough to keep FOR YOUR EYES ONLY moving along nicely.",1420502400,,1041,4.383419689119171

There is an awesome car chase scene. There is a fight scene during while Bond is skiing. It was a thrill ride from start to finish. It had a great story with great acting lead by one of Moore's best performances as Bond. This is a must own for any true Bond fan and an excellent introduction to a new fan of the Bond series.

478915,4,630251004X,"I saw ""For Your Eyes Only"" when it first came out, and here's what I remember from it:
 Opening Titles featuring singer Sheena Easton
 Lynn-Holly Johnson as a nymphomaniac figure skater
 Topol's scene chewing (literally) performance

The film makers decided to bring Bond back to earth after the spectacle of Moonraker for this installment of the franchise. The plot concerns the retrieval of a missile launch device sunken within a ship. Here the emphasis is on the story and spy intrigue rather than spectacular sets or gadgets.  Those who prefer a traditional, stripped down Bond film will like this.  However, the low key performances and mundane scenery (by Bond standards anyway) make for a largely forgettable film.

Acting
Roger Moore gives a straight forward performance, harking back to the secret agent of the early Sean Connery years.  Here Bond shows his tough side, shooting to kill and coldly disposing of several villains.  Smirks and other tongue in cheek mannerisms are kept in check.  Roger Moore's age is beginning to show though, enough that the filmmakers thought it necessary to shoot him in soft focus in several closeups!  There is of course, the obligatory romancing of the leading ladies, though fortunately, he declines Lynn-Holly Johnson's advances.

Carole Bouquet, who has the fine features of a model, shows almost no emotion in her icy portrayal of the main love interest - we know she is capable of showing it from the making of excerpts on the disc.  In contrast, the bubbly Lynn-Holly Johnson's performance as a hormonal teen chasing Bond is cringe-worthy, even if she isn't quite as annoying as I remember.  Lynn-Holly does looks very good on skis and has some interesting things to say in the extras.  It is nice to see Cassandra Harris, the late wife of Pierce Brosnan, on film, though her character, like Lynn-Holly's, seems superfluous to the story.

Julian Glover, a fine actor, seems to purposely underplay his part to be less of a caricature and thus a more believable (Spoiler Alert) villain .  However, his performance is so low key that I forgot he was even in this film.  Fortunately, the memorable antics of Topol as an anti-heroic smuggler make up for that (he loves his pistachio nuts).

Did I mention that Sheena Easton sings the title song (the only time as far as I am aware that a singer actually appears in a Bond title sequence)?  Maybe it's just me, but her performance sends shivers up my spine.  Kudos to Maurice Binder for the design of the marvelous title sequence.  For those of you who like the title sequence as much as I do, there is a version of it in the extras without the text - however the audio is slightly out of sync there - boo!  The extras also include a Sheena Easton music video which seems essentially the same as the title sequence, but it is from a mediocre source.  I wish they would have cast Sheena in the film - she couldn't have been any worse than Carole Bouquet or Lynn-Holly Johnson.

Scenery/Locales/Stunts
""For Your Eyes Only"" takes place only in Europe, specifically Greece and Italy (Italy also doubles for Spain).  You get to see the beautiful Mediterranean area (some of the underwater scenes were actually shot in the Bahamas) plus the Alps.  The pre-credit helicopter sequence, shot in England, has its moments, but seems out of place in this movie (seen today, it looks like it belongs in an Austin Powers movie).  Besides the underwater scenes, there is a car chase down a hillside olive grove, executed by Remy Julienne's stunt driving team, an extended ski chase involving motorcycles, and a climbing sequence up a rocky pillar.  These sequences are all well done, but if you have seen many Bond movies or their imitators (""The Eiger Sanction"", ""Cliffhanger"", various Jacky Chan movies, etc.) - ho-hum, they don't stand out as among the best Bond action sequences.

Musical Score
Long time Bond composer John Barry was by this time was too busy in Hollywood, so Bill Conti was given the assignment of the musical score.  Conti's blaring brand of music may be great for the ""Rocky"" films, but I found it less suitable for a Bond film.  It doesn't help that the ""orchestration"" (a synthesizer is frequently used) and sound mix seem distractingly harsh at times (see below). However, I thought that Conti did a good job with the title song.

Blu-ray Video & Audio Quality
The film elements on the Blu-ray release have been cleaned and restored.  The image looks very good to excellent, comparable to the other Blu-ray releases of Bond movies from the same era.  The sound quality, however, is another story.  I listened to the 5.1 audio which is said to be DTS-HD Master Audio.  I found it to be disappointing.  The  mix sounds shrill in some places and oddly balanced in others.  Sound effects, such as explosions, sound OK.

Special Features on Blu-ray Disc
The menu is elaborate but gimmicky. It can be hard to find things.  For example to access the title sequence without the text, one has to navigate: Special Features->007 Mission Control->007->Titles->Opening Titles-Textless.
There are three commentary tracks by:
 Roger Moore.
 Director John Glen & others, including Topol, Lynn-Holly Johnson.
 Producer Michael Wilson & other crew members.
Featurettes:
 Greece, Cortina (Italy) locales: making of videos (poor picture quality).
 Neptune's Journey: explains the working submarine prop and what happened to it.
 Inside For Your Eyes Only, narrated by Patrick Macnee - the best of the making of featurettes.
 Exotic Locations narrated by Maud Adams - short but nice, love the way she says European names.

Summary
The ""For Your Eyes Only"" Blu-ray was worth buying for me.  I don't think it's one of the Bond films that stand out as a classic, like ""Goldfinger"".  It is, however, solid entertainment with fine image quality, and a good helping of extras.",1392076800,,5859,4.890466531440162
478916,5,630251004X,"I love James Bond, and For Your Eyes Only is my favorite Bond movie with Roger Moore my favorite James Bond.",1391126400,,108,4.190476190476191
478917,4,630251004X,"This is the 12th Bond outing produced by Albert Broccoli and the 5th starring Roger Moore as 007.  He is clearly a bit long-in-the-tooth but still has the Bond swagger and style down pat.  This is actually one of his better performances.  The comedic tendencies of Moore's Bond films up to this point were always a bit much.  Here, things change. They are fairly limited to the early sequences.  The film takes a more serious storyline when the parents of Melina (Carole Bouquet) are gunned down before her eyes.

A couple things about Ms. Bouquet.  While I have long appreciated all of the ""Bond girls"" there is something about the smoky eyes, long black hair and distinctive beauty of her character that sets her apart.  This certainly helps to offset her on again, off again acting prowess.

Bond's mission is to recover a keyboard gizmo that has the ability to launch Polaris missiles from the British Navy's fleet of submarines.  It is laying at the bottom of the Aegean Sea where it sunk inside a disguised fishing trawler after hitting a mine.  The race is on as the Soviets want it as well.  They have hired Kristatos (Julian Glover), a Greek smuggler to retrieve the unit.  He is also ultimately responsible for the death of Melina's parents and she is on a mission of revenge.  To no one's surprise she and Bond meet and join forces.

It was actually refreshing to see Bond hold back on his romantic advances until late in the movie as the couple get to know each other a bit.  But in one scene you know Bond is still grieving over his wife's death in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Lynn-Holly Johnson plays Bibi, teenage eye-candy in training for the Olympics and who makes a play for Bond as well.  Given the age difference, Bond wisely resists.

This film is light on gadgets but full of excellent tricks and stunts.  A couple excellent car chase, skiing, rock climbing and great underwater photography.  The bad guys have numerous opportunities to kill Bond, but as usual they want to torture him first.  That of course will be their undoing.  This film also features one of my favorite Bond theme songs.  The titled song is sung by green-eyed beauty Sheena Easton.  For those interested, this is also the only Bond film that I can remember seeing a nip-slip.  See if you can find it.

This Blu ray version was released in 2008 and suffers from some of the style choices of the filmmakers of the 80's.  There is nothing particularly objectionable, but the transfer looks a bit flat.  Colors don't pop as they do in modern films.  This is likely not the fault of the transfer itself.  I suspect it is as good as it can be given the original material.  The transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

The audio is very good with the use of DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While this is the 12th Bond film I've watched (sequentially) in Blu ray it is the first that I can recall with an emphasis on the surround speakers.  Dialog is very well defined and the whole audio experience seems enhanced based on earlier films.  There is a nice assortment of extras.  Here they are:
- Audio Commentary with Director John Glen
- Audio commentary with Screenwriter Michael G. Wilson
- Audio commentary with Sir Roger Moore
- Deleted Scenes
- ""Bond in Greece""
- ""Bond in Cortina""
- ""Neptune's Journey""
- 007 Mission Control
- Mission Combat Manual
- Q Branch

478918,4,630251004X,"After a ship sunk off the coast of Albania, the world's superpowers begin a feverish search for its valuable lost cargo: the powerful ATAC system, which will give its bearer unlimited control over Polaris nuclear submarines. As Bond joins the search, he suspects the suave Kristatos (Julian Glover) of seizing the device.

The competition between nations grows more deadly by the moment, but Bond finds an ally in the beautiful Melina Havelock (Caroline Bouquet), who blames Kristatos for the death of her parents. The non-stop action includes automobile chases, thrilling underwater battles, and even a breathtaking tour over razor-sharp coral reefs, but all of this is merely a prelude to 007's cliffhanging assault of a magnificent mountaintop fortress.

James Bond(Roger Moore) is thrust into one of his most riveting adventures in this jam-packed free-for-all of outrageous stunts, passionate encounters and exciting confrontations, Agent 007 with lethal determination in a plot that finds him racing.

This action/drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when the title of this song FOR YOUR EYES ONLY by Sheena Easton was a big hit on the radio during this movies theatrical release back in the Summer of 1981 when Ronald Reagan was president and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1389139200,,1339,5.161290322580645

478923,4,630251004X,"About halfway through the film I realized that I didn't really have any idea what was going on and yet it didn't matter much at all since the film was just one action sequence after another and each one was just as exciting as the last, starting with a daring helicopter ride to a fight scene in scuba suits and a brush with sharks all leading up to that much lauded cliff sequence.  Yes, Roger Moore is too old for this (in fact, it felt like all the Bond mainstays were a year or two from a senior home) but John Glens handling of the material is fresh and fun and while none of it makes sense (that scuba scene alone was a hilarious campfest) it leaves the viewer completely invested and excited.",1383523200,,699,4.2556390977443606
478924,5,630251004X,"Stunt, after stunt, after stunt almost obliterates this film's attempt to return the James Bond series to its original origins. Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility. It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases proportionally with Roger Moore's age with each new film.

The first two thirds of the film are good, very good, classic Bond. However, the film falls asleep in the third. When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all. Bill Conti's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive. It is in the final third of the film that Conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring which only contributed to the anti climatic finale.

The sinking of the St. Georges, the attack on Kristatos' warehouse and Bond kicking Locque's car, with Locque still inside, off the cliff were high points that were excellently filmed.

In all John Glen's directorial debut as the primary director on a Bond film is a good one. Director Glen's second unit work on ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is well documented. His excellence shows her in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. John Glen's enormous contributions to the Bond series seem to have gone unsung and somehow forgotten. Let us not forget.",1378598400,,1381,4.96969696969697
478946,3,630251004X,"This 12th Bond film features Roger Moore in the title role again.  The script is well-written and tight but Moore looks like he is acting with one eye closed.  The action is decent but hampered by a poor score and the movie - a throwback to spy thrillers and the original Bond film, Dr. No is more taut.

The film opens with Bond visiting his wife's grave site and being afforded an opportunity to finally kill Blofeld when Blofeld's remote controlled helicopter is taken over by Bond.  The credits feature a Moore silhouette (a first fro Bond movies) and the main song's singer, Sheena Easton. The movie itself concerns Bond recovering a stolen ATAC (Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator) that has been stolen from a British surveillance ship, St. Georges while teaming up with the beautiful Melina (Carole Bouqet) whose parents were brutally slain by Kristatos' (Julian Glover)henchman, Gonzales.  Along the way, Bond and Melina must contend with numerous attempts on their lives, a horny skater, Bibi (lynn-Holly Johnson), KGB agents sent by Gogol to buy the ATAC unit and Emile Locque (Michael Gothard), a brutal killer who runs down Bond's love interest, Countess Lisi.  One of Bond's unlikely partners in this film is Columbo, a Greek rogue who is identified as the Dove and a former compatriot of Kristatos.  The film itself is decent but only true Bond fans will be able to stay with this long movie.  There is of course a shark scene involving Bond and Melina being dragged through a shark-infested coral reef and some hard-bitten scenes involving Bond.  The number of gadgets have been reduced in favor of taut action. This is a good but not great Bond film with a nice feel to it

Sidenotes: Most of the film is shot in Europe, including the sheer cliffs which Bond has to climb.  The character of M is on vacation and Minister of Defence (Geoffrey Keen) assigns Bond to the case.",1378512000,,1894,4.796923076923077

478980,4,630251004X,"Back to basics for Bond. After the over the top antics of 007 in space, he comes crunching back down to Earth.
It's a cold war story, a more humanistic story of revenge and betrayal and it gives the audience characters with a bit of motivation...well...as much as an early 80's Bond film can deliver.

Based on Ian Fleming's short stories Risico and For Your Eyes Only with a set piece or two thrown in from his earlier novel Live and Let Die featuring Bond caught up in a feud between two big time Greek smugglers, one of them working for the Russians but which one?

James Bond shines more as a super spy simply because of the absence of gadgetry and relying mainly on his wits to get out of danger, even Roger Moore's Lotus super-spy-car is put to the sword early in the movie.

Roger Moore himself shines a bit more as a more ruthless Bond too, as he has to dig for the truth and eliminating a helpless bad guy at one point. An interesting footnote is the opening pre-credits sequence, intended for a new actor playing the title role as Moore wasn't confirmed for a fifth Bond until quite late in the day.

Hence why Bond is shown laying flowers on his dead wife's grave - a nod to Lazenby and then disposing of an unnamed wheelchair bound assassin who bares a close resemblance to Donald Pleasances' version of arch villain Blofeld.

Then 22 year old Carole Bouquet plays the vengeful daughter after her parents murderer, the age gap widening between over 50 Moore and his leading ladies and Julian Glover plays the sly Kristatos one of the smugglers and amiable Topol, the other. Set pieces such as the ski chase and the rock climbing segment are among the best in Bond's history.

The disc is first class with fantastic extras, Moore absent on the documentary unfortunately, would've liked to have heard his take on this film as he really nailed the role this time round. The picture transfer is amazing, even more so than Thunderball, the underwater sequences are so clear and crisp it's like looking through a newly installed fish tank. This may be because some of the ""underwater"" scenes use a sound stage and trick photography.

Also the 5.1 surround is amazing, mainly because by 1981 sound production on movies were getting really sophisticated, which unfortunately the disco soundtrack isn't. It really dates the film and feels at times intrusive. A minor drawback, all up a great entry 8/10.",1371340800,,2406,4.633802816901408

Basically the British have lost their code description machine at the bottom of the Mediterranean near Greece and Bond has to prevent the Soviets from getting. Pretty simple set-up but there are complications along the way of course. The action scenes both on the ski slopes and underwater are awesome. I am continually struck by how good the stunt work is in these films especially when him and the Bond girl are being dragged through coral reef.

Moore probably should have called it a day with this one but continued with ""Octopussy"" and ""View to a Kill""- avoid both of those but check ""For Your Eyes Only"" out.",1361404800,,864,4.690789473684211

479065,4,630251004X,"I bought this having never seen it before but had read that this was one of the most realistic Bond movies ever. Upon watching it, I noticed several things: (1. Roger Moore makes a great James Bond: I own Man With The Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loves Me, and Moonraker, and I have a special fondness for The Spy Who Loves Me: I originally watched it, along with Moonraker at the movie theaters at the tender ages of 13 and 15. Maybe Bond movies were made for 13 to 15 year old boys, but I've loved both movies ever since. As for Man With The Golden Gun, I bought that not too long ago because I love Christopher Lee movies and that is among my favorite Bond films because Christopher Lee is in it. This one I bought 35 years later and I was curious what I would think: (1. Moore makes a great Bond, he is similar to Pierce Brosnan who almost seems to project Moore in his Bond films: suave, sophisticated, a woman's man, and a killer who enjoys killing, especially when the people he kills get him upset for killing his friends and or lovers. In this one, we get to see Moore as suave, sophisticated, a woman's man, and a killer who enjoys killing, especially when the people he kills get him upset for killing his friends and or lovers. Perhaps the reason I have enjoyed watching Moore Bond films is that he does all the things a young boy would wish to do: be a woman's man and at the same time can kill enemies without hesitation. Of course, the real young boy could never do that, but watching Bond films are for boys anyway, wish fulfillment. 35 years later, Bond has become a guilty pleasure for me, letting me go back to a 13 year old's wish fulfillment, the same as people watching Star Wars 35 years later might feel. Is it realistic? Perhaps. There is no super villian intent on destroying the world but looking for realism in Bond films is like one movie put it, like charging a man for murder in Vietnam, the equivalent of handing out speeding tickets at the Indianapolis 500, or better yet, like looking for virgins and non killers in Bond films: You just won't find it. Still, I enjoyed watching Moore play Bond, there's a beautiful woman who is quite the killer in the movie, an excellent ally, and a nasty villain: What else could you ask for in a Bond film?",1349481600,,2271,4.320843091334894
479066,5,630251004X,"Bond (Roger Moore) is in the cemetery putting flowers on the grave of his wife.  A priest notifies him that a helicopter is coming to pick him up because of an emergency.  A man in a wheel chair is remote controlling the helicopter after he electrocutes the pilot.  The man in the wheelchair is a member of SPECTRE that Bond has injured and he is seeking revenge.  The handicapped man is sitting on a rooftop watching as he torments Bond by nearly missing a large smoke stack.  Bond disables the remote control and flies the copter by himself and he picks up the wheelchair by the back with the copter and dumps the assassin into the very tall chimney stack.

Bond is sent on assignment to find the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC) aboard a sunken spy boat named the St Georges.  The ship posing as a commercial fishing vessel accidently pulls in an underwater mine in a fishing net and sinks their ship.  The ministry of defense is afraid that he Russians could get their hands on the device and use it to launch submarines ballistic missiles anywhere they wanted.  The KGB is indeed on top of the opportunity to recover the lost box.  They have sent a man to Greece who finds and kills Sir Timothy Havelock and his wife with a small plane using a mounted machine gun.  Timothy was asked to find the lost sunken vessel before he was murdered.  Their beautiful daughter Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) was on board the boat when her parents were killed.

The assassin is named Gonzales and Bond goes to spy on him to try to find out who hired him to kill Timothy.  Bond is captured outside Gonzales's villa but escapes as Gonzales is killed by an arrow in the back as he dives into his pool.  The escaping bond finds Melina as he leaves and she saves his life by shooting a guard who is right behind him....

This is another high action Bond film that I really enjoyed.  The chase for the ATAC takes the cast into some of the most beautiful areas you can see and the action chase scenes are intense and well filmed.  There are several very attractive Bond girls in the movie and Bibi (Lynn-Holly Johnson ) is very young but plays a very aggressive female.  Countess Lisl von Schlaf ( Cassandra Harris) plays the role of a  mistress of Columbo (Topol) who becomes a strong ally to Bond. This is a good combination of a spy movie and of old adversaries in Columbo and Kristatos (Julian Glover) who is the real villain.

This is a first class spy movie with action galore.  It has some great snow skiing chases, ski jump, and beach chases.  It has a great cast who help put together a suspenseful and exciting movie.  I recommend it to you.

The beautiful title music on this movie is sung by Sheena Easton!",1347667200,,2719,4.466531440162272
479077,5,630251004X,"After thirty years, the longevity of ""For Your Eyes Only"" is well-deserved for exhibiting so few of the campy and often eye-rolling, high-concept gimmicks associated with the successful Roger Moore era (1973-1985).  Released in 1981, ""For Your Eyes Only"" served as 54-year old Moore's fifth Bond film and five-time Bond director John Glen's first installment.  In this surprisingly gritty Cold War adventure, Agent 007 and British-Greek ally Melina Havelock (French model Carole Bouquet) are in a race against time to retrieve a top secret transmitter from a sunken spy ship in the Ionian Sea while cleverly fending off the KGB and a band of ruthless Greek mercenaries. Co-starring Julian Glover (as Kristatos), Topol (as Columbo), and the late Cassandra Harris (as Lisl), this particular Bond film pretty much has it all: great acting, terrific plot twists, genuine suspense, and the 50-year old franchise's best diversity of top-notch stunts (driving, skiing, scuba diving, mountain climbing, etc.), and, of course, a collection of scenic homages inviting tourism to the Italian ski slopes; the Greek Islands; and the Bahamas (where the  underwater scenes were actually filmed).

The film kicks off with a pre-credits sequence remembering 1969's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" which was originally intended to introduce a new Bond actor, if necessary.  It depicts Bond visiting his late wife Tracy's grave before tangling once again with a familiar bald nemesis in a wheelchair with a creepy affection for fluffy white cats.  Although the sequence ends predictably campy, it is still great fun.  From that point on, the first Bond movie without ""M"" (as actor Bernard Lee had recently passed away) focuses on Bond's mission to regain a lost submarine missile code transmitter (called ATAC) from a sunken British vessel before the KGB gets it first.  Meanwhile, a vengeful young woman, Melina Havelock (who is handy with a crossbow), soon becomes involved, as the ruthless Greek mercenaries who ordered her marine archaeologist parents' assassination are the same ones after the transmitter.

Balancing the plot's somber tone is Moore and Bouquet's charmingly platonic chemistry (i.e. see their repartee in a car chase outside Madrid), which becomes a vital asset later on as the film's pace bogs down underwater.  Further, the ongoing feud between prime suspects Columbo and Kristatos will keep viewers guessing, as Topol and Julian Glover make a fictional smuggling rivalry feel very real and personal dating back decades to their characters' days together in the Greek Resistance.  Serving as the backdrop to Bond and Melina's adventure is the wonderful cinematography.  It only enhances with each viewing the gorgeous shots of the Greek Islands and other well-chosen locales (i.e. wintry Cortina) without distracting viewers.  Admirably, the movie remains perfectly believable most of the time (including Moore's obvious age), but, consistent with the Roger Moore era, there are also some fun gags.  Examples: an amusing scene in which teenage Olympic ice-skating hopeful Bibi Dahl (Lynn-Holly Johnson) fails to seduce an uninterested (and rightfully so) Bond in his hotel room  ... or the British Prime Minister's congratulatory phone call to ""007"" before the end titles.

I would rate this highly entertaining movie as Moore's second best Bond film (after ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ahead of slower-paced ""Octopussy"") because the whole, well-balanced package (including Sheena Easton's sultry Oscar-nominated title song) is provided here.  Best of all, ""For Your Eyes Only"" is worthy of countless repeat viewings, which ultimately justifies its existence on DVD and/or blu-ray.

Rating: 9/10 (for ages 12 and up for mature themes and bloodless violence).",1346198400,,3764,5.416095890410959
479078,4,630251004X,"For those who, like me, are not the biggest fans of the Roger Moore years at the helm of 007, For Your Eyes Only stands out as a kind of turning point. Gone to an extent are the overdone comedic routines that seem to be hallmarks of Moore's previous performances as Bond. Instead we find a more serious and determined Bond. He shows more of a Connery-style charm on the ladies while appearing too old for them or borderline at best. Still, we see a better Bond for sure.

  Compared to the previous opponents of the Moore years, Julian Glover's Kristatos is a very convincing villain. He is devious and behind the scenes like a crafty puppet master. He even sells himself as one of the good guys and doesn't end up having a silly gimmick when his identity is finally revealed. No metal teeth, no space ships and no sycophants to be seen. Instead, we get the standard, old-fashioned KGB Communist plot to take over the world. Now that's more like it. Additionally, Bond's female sidekick is a definite upgrade. Being both hot and also intelligent, Carole Bouquet's Ms. Havelock is no dummy and she is wicked with a bow.

  Without giving away more plot details for those budding Bond fans who have not seen this movie (are you out there?) I am going to summarize by saying this movie is well worth seeing. It is arguably the best Bond film of the Moore years although Octopussy also deserves honorable mention. I am taking away a star because for all of its strengths this is still a Moore 007 film. Overall though, it is worth picking up even for a casual Bond fan. At the time of writing this Amazon has it on Blu-ray for $14.99. If you can get it for that price or less go for it. It is a fun attempt at a return to a Connery-era Bond experience and it really delivers.",1342051200,4,1771,4.400611620795107

Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility. It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases proportionally with Roger Moore's age with each new film.

This movie to me, is moore's best outing as Bond. They finally got away from the gadgets, and grounded Bond in reality a bit. And I know Moore didn't like the scene where he kicks the car off the cliff killing the asassin that had been tailing him, but to me. That's who Bond is, it's either kill or be killed in his world. The plot is basic, after a british spy trawler is sunk, bond races the russians for the mtac that was on board. Along the way, he teams up with Melina. Basically to keep her from killing everybody responsible for the deaths of her parents, this is a good, solid James bond Movie.

479086,5,630251004X,"Although ""For Your Eyes Only"" can hardly be called a realistic action/spy film, it is entertaining, free from the usual over-the-top bond gadgets, and, best of all, a welcome departure from the space-themed ""Moonraker"" that was essentially United Artists' effort to jump on the heavy ""Star Wars"" bandwagon of the 70s.  Between watching scenes of Greece & Spain and watching studio lot shots of space stations, vehicles, and lasers I'll pick the former any day.

The other positive byproduct of Bond coming back down to earth was that the movie had to use more of its support from the script and the inclusion of some memorable skiing action (always exciting).

The Blu-ray version is also very well mastered.  The video quality is bolstered by crisp detail, clean colors, and good contrast.

479107,4,630251004X,"I grew up on Sean Connery, whose Bond is as gritty and tough as he is suave and ironic.  Moore I always found too slick and, well, corny, making too much fun of the genre with the absurdly impossible.  This film, I think, is the closest he came to the Connery version:  it brings out the best in Moore, who I respect as an actor (if not a comedic one), yet the role still belongs to him.

After the idiotically cartoonish Moonraker, the filmmakers wanted to return to the source and they did so with complete success.  This is his only one where I could believe it while I was watching it rather than feel someone was just making it up.  It is a caper, with a lot at stake, that is solved by daring fights against some serious baddies.  The characters, and of course the stunningly youthful Bouquet in her prime but also Topol and Julian GLover, are expertly drawn and splendidly acted.

The plot is pretty formulaic:  searching for an atomic device, etc., all over southern Europe to keep it out of the hands of SOviet agents.  The extras, I found, are also rather pompous - they talk about the production like it is some kind of high art.  Nonetheless, this is one Moore Bond that you can sit back and just enjoy.  Even the humor, particularly the ending with Thatcher, worked for me.

Warmly recommended.",1320710400,3,1307,4.4411764705882355
479108,5,630251004X,"After ""Moonraker"" came out producers of the James Bond series of films wanted to get back to the basics of what made the Bond films so successful in the first place: revenge and its consequences. These attributes were not in the previous movie as ""Moonraker"" was more a science fiction release.

 Coming out in 1981 ""For Your Eyes Only"" made an impressive $195,000,000 at the box office and is known as one of Roger Moore's best portrayals as the magnetic and charming Bond. The movie also features the beautiful and haunting Sheena Easton performance on the title track, probably my favorite of all the Bond songs.

479109,4,630251004X,"Product not entirely genuine. Discs themselves appear to be genuine but case is NOT. It's like the DVDs were taken out of its original case, put into a really thin/cheap case, and then shrink-wrapped to look new! I own other DVDs from this series and none of them came with cases like this. Additionally, package did not include paper slip-sleeve for DVD case, which is also a feature of the ""Two-Disc Ultimate Edition"" DVD packaging. Do not buy from NorAm International Partners, Inc. (when you view their profile it shows Direct Liquidations). Whoever it is, don't buy from them. Suspicious packaging makes for a disappointing purchase.

The film is, well...the film. If you're buying it, I'm sure you've seen it and enjoy Bond films. I think this is one of Roger Moore's better movies. He is starting to look a little old though, which always disturbs me. Carole Bouquet's role as Melina Havelock is by far the weakest aspect of the film. Her performance is stiff and uninspired.

It's typically silly/played for laughs Bond with exotic locales, half-naked women, and somebody always having Bond in a bind. Yet, James always seems to find a way out. How that happens, is half the fun.

Good visuals too, and a sharp picture for a DVD that isn't Blu-Ray.",1303084800,3,502,4.758620689655173
479111,2,630251004X,"The 12th entry to the James Bond series pits Bond against a Greek thug under the employ of the USSR. They are both searching for a device that manipulates the course of British war submarines and this could mean a very dangerous advantage for the east if they got their hands on it. Unfortunately, that's a lot of more exciting than it sounds in this unremarkable and forgetable thriller.

The main villian, named Kristatos and played by Julian Glover, is just as bland as Stromberg or Drax; He has no real passion or sadism. Though the action pieces are less outrageous, they are still comical in nature and un-remarkable in their inventiveness. I liked the fact that the ATAC device was essentially like the ""Lecktor"" cipher in 1963's From Russia With Love but the film dosen't do enough to make us care that it's important. Yes, we all know the Russians want it and why but their perticipation in this film is barely noticable. Why couldn't we have Russian thugs after Bond instead of having the major threat being just a middleman ? They tried to aim with a ""Cold War"" plot but they gave us none of the politics.

The Cold War plot is not the only thing that was wasted in this film. Carole Bouquet stars as Melina Havelock who's parents were murdered because of their involvement in the retrival of the ATAC device. Melina Havelock was based on Judy Havelock from Ian Fleming's short story ""For Your Eyes Only"", one of two short stories that was the basis of this film with the other being ""Risico"". Havelock's role pretty much is the same, she is out to seek revenge for the death of her parents. However here Melina is re-written more politically correct, she impales a few people in her quest for vengance and she never goes beyound a one-dimensional character. Bond tries to warn her a grand total of two times about vengance, once when they first encounter each other and at the finale when Melina has Kristatos in her cross hairs. Why did Bond encourage her to persue this vendetta and on the same token discourages her from persuing her parents' killers ? This was substance that was not explored.

This is a very standard action film and a very rountine thriller. The only solid part of this film, and probably some of the best in a Bond film ever, was when the Risico story was exploited when Bond was tailing Columbo. After that, the film falls right back down into the depths of banality. Sure, Moonraker was dumb but at least it wasn't boring like For Your Eyes Only.",1289865600,4,2484,4.5775280898876405

479116,3,630251004X,"For Your Eyes Only is widely considered Roger Moore's best portrayal of James Bond. I've always enjoyed Live and Let Die more, but to each his own; I'm certainly not going to argue that For Your Eyes Only is one of the better Bond flicks.

Until Daniel Craig's Casino Royale debut, For Your Eyes Only was also considered the toughest, grittiest portrayal of the suave spy on the silver screen. Once again, I'm not going to put up much of an argument.

The movie plays out like a Bond Paint by Numbers picture. In a series built around self imposing clich&eacute;s and ideals, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it's a good thing. Where other Bond films have tried to do something different and failed (like Die Another Day's attempt to take Bond into the sci-fi realm...) FYEO sticks to the nitty gritty, and it works good enough to present a solid, fun romp through Greece, England, the Bahamas, and Italy.

The plot (like all Bond plots) is nothing really noteworthy: a British spy ship sinks, Bond is sent to retrieve a communications device which was onboard, and obviously the Soviets are on the scene competing with James to retrieve it. Like I said, Paint by Numbers. What makes FYEO stand out among the other Bond films is the way Moore showcases his true acting muscles in it. Until this point, Moore had been playing a character playing Bond; this was the only film in all of Moore's run which felt as if he was playing the character as he imagined it, not as people imagined it should be.

It's a very no-nonsense performance which remained untouched by Bond actors for over 20 years, but I can't help but feel that Daniel Craig's spectacular job in Casino Royale diminished the impact of Roger's gritty Bond for me, and therefore leaves this picture in a strange gray space between two giants. On one side you have Connery who will never, ever be out-suaved in movies; on the other, you have Craig who plays Bond just a little realer than Moore did.

Don't get me wrong, Moore does a fantastic job and it's a must-watch for any fan. I just don't see it as his best movie, and certainly not the best in the series' run. The gadgets seem even more outdated than normal due to the realism, the score is just awful by today's standards, and the rest-like I said, Paint by Numbers. As a Bond film, it does what it needs to do and fans will be satisfied and grinning from ear to ear. Compared to some of the better products, though, it definitely feels more dated.

On the bright side, this is one of the better video transfers in the six Blu-Ray set when it comes to clarity. (Purists may be dismayed to know that digital noise reduction was utilized to a [apparent] larger degree than the other releases.) The result is a film with no grain or noise, which is amazing given the fact it's older than most of our readers. Sadly, the colors didn't hold up as well. It's new enough that I expected a better palette, but it's old enough that I'm not too shocked it didn't deliver in terms of vivid colors. The movie itself is drab compared to other Bond films, so it's not a huge loss. More like an unfortunately side effect-better clarity makes the visual flaws from the source and filming method that much more noticeable.

Much like Dr. No, the audio here hits on all cylinders. I'm amazed at how well the team transferred the source to 5.1 without any obvious tampering, and without the stop-go type channel shifts present in other older releases remastered for Blu-Ray. Effects bump, subtle sounds stay subtle, and you can hear a pin drop. If there's one fault with the audio it's that the effects and music are TOO good, meaning there are times when you can barely hear the talking over the action. An unfortunate outcome, but one that's easily negated by some careful remote management.

Sadly, once again the extras here are mostly nothing we haven't seen before. While there are multiple new additions which are must-see for diehard Bond fans (two deleted scenes introduced by John Glen, as well as alternate angles on a different scene) all the other new Blu-Ray specific features are new menus, or better definition on still image galleries. The extras themselves are worth a watch, but if you've purchased this during any of the previous DVD releases, the supplemental Blu-Ray features just fail to capitalize on such a momentous release.",1249689600,7,4363,4.620645161290323

Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility. It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases proportionally with Roger Moore's age with each new film.

The first two thirds of the film are good. However, the film drops out in the third. When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all. Bill Conti's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive. It is in the final third of the film that Conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring, which is actually very good, but unfortunately only contributed to the film's anti climatic finale.

The sinking of the St. Georges, the attack on Kristatos' warehouse and Bond's face to face confrontation with Locque kicking the villain's  car, with Locque still inside, off the cliff were high points and were excellently filmed.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY makes a good effort to return to the pre-DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER tone of the Bond films. At the time of its release I think it played very well but with age it looks more like a grand experiment that didn't quite succeed. However, they did try.

479168,3,630251004X,"I just watched this movie for the first time and didn't see the Moore films as they came out, so my opinion isn't colored by nostalgia or affection for Roger Moore. In fact, I had only started watching the classic Bond films a few years ago.

I've always been a bit lukewarm to Moore's portrayal of 007 as he seemed a bit overly formal and stiff when compared to the graceful yet rugged qualities of Sean Connery and more recently, Daniel Craig. However, most of the reviews from Bond fans I've read seemed to indicate that this film and the Spy Who Loved Me were the two best Moore films; with people citing FYEO as having the ""back to basics"" approach to the franchise with Ian Fleming style espionage at the forefront.

While it compares favorably to the rest of the Moore films, it's just lacking the qualities that make a good Bond film a great Bond film. The action sequences are quaint by today's standards, although there's some incredible stuntwork done on the skis; while Connery's personality and the superior overall direction of his best films allowed me to forgive some of the ackward-by-today's-standards moments in his action sequences, FYEO doesn't have the charm or charisma to allow for that same leniency. Roger Moore just seems old here, moving slowly with unconvincing edits trying to make him seem at least somewhat athletic. It doesn't work.

The plot itself drags a bit after the first hour of the movie; while this is strictly personal opinion, I was hoping we could just be done with the whole thing at that point. The movie felt pretty light on plot, with the exception of one twist, depending on the action sequences to provide the thrills of a 007 picture. Again, they don't.

All in all, this movie is a solid entry into the 007 library but lacks the qualities that give a Bond movie the timeless rewatchability some of the classics of the series enjoy. There's nothing in this film that you can't find in another Bond film, only done better in the others. As a Bond fan who's discovering the series through DVD, slowly but surely, I'd wager that this film likely only appeals to fans who have nostalgic feelings toward this era of Bond, or the fans who enjoy Moore's take on James Bond.",1225929600,,2218,4.636132315521628

John Glen brings a sure hand to the action scenes but not much in the way of style -- 80s windbreakers abound-- and you're constantly making allowances for Moore's age.

479173,4,630251004X,"For Your Eyes Only is showing its age a bit now. At the time a hugely welcome return to basics after the leaden FX spectacle of Moonraker (the second remake of You Only Live Twice in a row for the series), it still holds up as one of the best of Roger Moore's Bonds, but its faults are much more apparent than they once were. Among them is the tendency to undercut everything with unfunny little jokes (a scoreboard keeping count of thugs Bond knocks out, Bond giving a bemused royal wave to pursuing thugs, and a horrendous cameo from a Maggie Thatcher lookalike in the end), some flat studio work (no disguising the fact that the mountaintop Greek monastery is just a Pinewood set), a dated Bill Conti score and a comic relief nympho nymphet Lynn Holly Johnson constantly throwing herself at a disinterested Bond. Luckily, the pluses more than compensate - a stronger plot than usual for the Moore efforts, at least one cold-blooded murder, and a very welcome absence of gadgets until the postscript that ensures that Bond has to extricate himself with his own wits in some pretty good setpieces. Best among them is a mountaineering sequence where he uses his bootlaces - not steel bootlaces, just common bootlaces - to save himself in an old mountaineers trick.

Incidentally, with Blofeld still sporting the neck brace he wore at the end of OHMSS, and with the film beginning at Tracey Bond's graveside it's tempting to think of the pre-title sequence as a way of making amends for the jokey way Bond's nemesis was disposed of in Diamonds Are Forever were the following sequence not the proud possessor of the most surreal line in the entire Bond series, the infamous ""I'll buy you a delicatessen - in stainless steel!"" So, while this may be one of the Moore serious of Roge's outings, it's not exactly Bergman territory.

It's worth picking up the two-disc Ultimate Edition set despite it not having a great many more extras than the original sngle-disc release. However, if you just want the film the remastered single disc is a good bet, and includes a new commentary from Moore (also on the two-disc set).",1202860800,3,2113,4.708108108108108

With this 5th go-around as 007, Moore turns in his grittiest, toughest, and best overall performance as Bond!  Carole Bouquet has solid presence as the beautiful, resourceful, and revenge-minded Melina Havelock.  As Milos Columbo, Topol is a scene stealer!  In my own humble opinion, he's the best Bond male ally in the film series history!  British pro Julian Glover gives a wonderfully chameleon-like performance as Bond Baddie Aristotle Kristatos.  He is almost overshadowed by Michael Gothard who plays henchman Loque with silent and deadly relish!  If this movie has one major debit in the casting department its Lynn-Holly Johnson.  She is way too young and cute to be a Bond girl!

Former Bond film editor John Glen though, knows his stuff as he takes over the directing reins.  He brings the right amount of energy, style, vigor, and realism to his first Bond effort.  This Bond epic also contains one of the best assortments of thrill sequences (air, land, sea, snow, beach, cliffs), ever to grace any action film!  Sheena Easton beautifully warbles out the Oscar-nominated title tune!

The producers must have re-evaluated what direction the franchise was taking & decided to get Bond back to basics. The decision couldn't have come at a better time; ""For Your Eyes Only"" ranks as one of Roger Moore's best outings alongside ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". Here, the gadgetry is minimized & it's all about ""the man"" again as Moore plays him with lean determination.
FYEO includes one of the best Bond openings ever: A ""humanizing"" moment with Bond placing flowers on his wife's grave--a really nice touch connecting the film with ""On Her Majesty's Secret Secret Service"" in nostalgic poignancy--and climaxing the scene with a wild helicopter ride as Bond is menaced by an old nemesis (anyone remember a classic Bond foe with a bald head & white cat?).
The supporting cast is top-notch: Topol as an ally from the Greek underworld; Julian Glover lends sinister presence as the baddie; and there's even an amusing subplot as Bond is pursued by a much-too-young future Olympic skater.
My personal favorite of the Moore-driven Bond films & a terrific effort.",1196208000,7,1232,4.843601895734597
479176,5,630251004X,"I'll go out on a limb and say that this is my favorite Bond movie ever - period.  After the sci-fi fantasy feel of Moonraker, James Bond has been brought back down to Earth - so to speak - in an adventure that is upmost classic in all regards, and highly memorable to the very end.  Roger Moore's much improved performance after Moonraker proves he can be ever much as Bond as Connery or the rest of them.

Even the pre-credits scene gives Bond a chance to conclude some unfinished business from the days of SPECTRE.  The first image we see is Bond standing above his wife's tombstone, and soon hostage aboard a helicopter piloted by remote by a man who looks like no other than Bond's old nemesis - Blofeld.  He's even got the same white cat with him.  But before the opening credits and theme begin, it would appear that Blofeld's end has finally come - especially since he never returns again in a Bond film.

The plot is more down to Earth this time around too, and quite more realistic, pitting countries against one another instead of a super-villain attempting to take over the planet.  There is however, a load of villains in the story, but all working for each other who in the end, have a connection to Russia.  The plot revolves around an English system known as ATAC, which is top secret tracking controls.  The ship carrying the ATAC system has gone down in the ocean, and various criminal minds hired by Russia are sent out to find the system, but along comes James Bond and a girl named Melina (who's parent's were murdered by these men) to find the system first.

In addition to a well paced and written plot, the charcaters are certainly above average in this Bond film, both in performance and interest.  As stated earlier, Roger Moore proves he can still be Bond and the Bond girl - Melina - is actually an intelligent Bond girl who shows she can have a great use in a Bond movie to get the job done.  The villains, especially Kristatos and Eric Kriegler, both prove themselves as well.  Kristatos - the main villain in the film - is intelligent and certainly has character.  Kriegler is the KBG hitman, who gives Bond plenty of fights and chases throughout a variety of action scenes.

The locations in For Your Eyes Only are also among some of the best.  The films begins in Spain, and travels to the snow covered mountains in Northern Italy, followed by both land, underwater, and mountain locations in Greece.  All the scenes are beautifully shot, including the action scenes that were filmed in these locations as well.

The action is certainly non-stop in this film, and just about every type of action you can think of is in this movie from beginning to end.  In addition to the numerous shootout and one on one fights, there is a car chase scene in Spain, plenty of ski chases on the slopes in Italy, underwater action, mountain climbing suspense, and a wonderfully shot scene of Bond and Melina being dragged through shallow water and coral reefs amongst the sharks.  The list goes on.

What joy it is to see that after some interesting (yet fun) films, Bond has returned to his roots - and with a silent bang.  For Your Eyes Only doesn't have the ridiculous feel of Moonraker for sure, but quitely, this one snuck up, loaded with tons of action, great characters, loacations, and a well-written story that is a must own film period.

He teams up with the lovely Carole Bouquet, a pale, raven-haired vigilante who is also after the bad guys to avenge the brutal murder of her parents in Greece.

""For Your Eyes Only"" is a top-notch, wildly entertaining entry into the Bond series. The stunts and action sequences are spectacular. There are spectacular car chases, ski chases, exotic locations, some beautiful underwater photography and as expected, beautiful women. Roger Moore is at his best as 007 James Bond. Despite his age, his charm is intact and his performance here is much grittier than his previous, more humorous portrayals of the celebrated secret agent. Although the film, like previous installments, is grossly over-the-top, it's all done brilliantly and the films pace is virtually flawless. Scene after scene, we are rewarded with suspense, awesome stunts, beautiful photography and I must state that Carol Bouquet's portrayal as a tough-as-nails beauty with a velvet hand in an iron glove is a pleasure to watch. Too bad she is one of the least famous of the Bond girls.

""For Your Eyes Only"" is one of my favorite films of the never-ending series, alongside ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Let and Live Die"" and technically, I find it one of the best in the entire catalogue. 007 is tougher, meaner and the live action stunt sequences are a refreshing change from the over-top-CGI-Brosnan Bond entries that the newer generation have grown accustomed to.

479208,4,630251004X,"The worst excesses of the 70's fatuous Bond's are laid to rest in this superior Bond movie.  All the Bonds are entertainment to a certain formula which is always entertaining to a degree.. but the producers decision to `come back down to Earth' after Moonraker pays off handsomely with a more adult feeling script and some genuine drama and subterfuge going on.
When a British spy trawler sinks suddenly, both sides of the Cold War set out to retrieve the coding device known as the ATAC.  The first victims are the Havelock's, marine biologists who use their diving as a cover to retrieve the device from the wreck.  Their daughter, Melina, sets out for revenge and this brings her into contact with Bond.  Their journey takes them from Corfu to Greece, where Bond must find out who is his enemy - the sophisticated oil and shipping magnate Kristatos (Julian Glover), or Columbo (Topol), the smuggler.
It's a neat script, and executed in an able and unshowy manner by John Glen, more than capable of taking the hot seat after editing and second unit directing so many previous Bonds.  A neat idea was in having Blofeld eliminated in the opening credit scene - one which introduces the idea of revenge, a theme for the movie, and gets the silliness out of the way, as if to make a fresh slate for the rest of the movie.  Moore is, alas, starting to look a little paunchy and wrinkled - he very nearly did not come back for this movie, but was persuaded back for an undisclosed sum.  His scenes with the young teenage skater are just a little uncomfortable to watch, with Moore in his 50's.  Carole Bouquet is gorgeous and exotic - great Bond girl material.  The only downside is that she and Moore never seem to generate any real chemistry - though the plot does not require too much of it anyway.
There is a jarring note, that knocks off a whole star from the rating.  The electronic music by Bill Conti was modern in its day, but horribly dated and - dare I say it - amateurish sounding now.  Also, in quibble mode, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic - but it sure beats a yawn inducing evil lair exploding yet again.
With the usual stunts, car chases, ski chases, climbing, exotic locations, beautiful women etc all serving the story instead of acting as individual scenes pasted in to make up the formula, this is quite possibly the finest Bond Moore was in, even if not his personal best performance in the role.

The Extras are the most complete imaginable, with the Ultimate Edition was again giving us all from the Special Edition, and a bit more.  Some fascinating behind the scenes shots from Cortina and Greece, a deleted scene and multi angle shot of the pivotal scene with Bond killing the henchman in Connery style rather than Moore style for a change, a featurette on the submersible created for the movie, and a new commentary from Sir Roger Moore himself.  Picture is perfect, and the sound mix is the best so far for any of the Bonds up to this one.",1193097600,,2969,4.556390977443609
479209,4,630251004X,"This bond movie has all the trademarks of the James Bond genre:  several locales with gorgeous scenery, fancy sports cars (in this case, a Lotus), underwater diving scenes with lotsa sharks, a ski chase, some cool gadgets and (most importantly) beautiful babes.  In spite of that, it still sways towards being one of the more middle-of-the-road Bond movies:  good entertainment, but not a great film.

This particular Bond is most well known for having the infamous rumor that the Bond girl had a sex-change operation.  Is the rumor true?  Well, yes & no.  It is true that A girl in the film switched genders.  She (he?) is only on-screen for about 3 seconds, waltzing in front of a swimming pool wearing a bikini.  It is NOT true that the main girl, Carole Bouquet, was ever anything else other than a woman.

The plot centers around a British spy ship that was accidently sunk.  As you might expect, both the good guys & the bad guys are in a rush to find it.  The British don't want any classified hardware / information compromised, while the sinister bad guys are trying to get their grubby hands on the goods to sell to the highest bidder.

Everything seems re-hashed in this movie. The submarine plot thing was done in ""Spy"" as was the ski-slope-shooting thing. The villains are boring and the punchlines are much less witty than in previous films. Even the black jack scene is anti-climactic! And who the heck created that Bebe character? The opening sequence is the only saving grace but even that is not worth the purchase price. And, as another reviewer pointed out, the grand finale leaves much to be desired. If you want the best plot/landscape/villain/action combo of all the Bond movies featuring Roger Moore, stick with ""Spy"", ""Octopussy"", ""Live"" or ""View"".",1183248000,5,780,4.961832061068702
479211,5,630251004X,"FOR YOUR EYES ONLY would have been the perfect swan song for Roger Moore as James Bond.  After almost a decade of Bond films to his credit, Moore was ever frequently inserted into silly story lines more appropriate for a Richard Lester production.  The plots were all scenarios that would have gone over well in the 1960s, but certainly not in the intellectual 1970s.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY was a redemption, of sorts, for the franchise.  First and foremost, there is a believable plot tied to (what were then) current events.  Instead of underwater lairs and villainous plots to destroy humanity from an orbiting space station we have a story about the recovery of a crypto device.  Okay, maybe it was a little similar to the story line in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. If so it certainly brought the story up to date.  Secondly there is no mega villain attempting to take over the world.  It is really a spy versus spy story.  Finally we have a Bond movie where the stunts are somewhat believable.  In Summer 1981, when I saw this film for the first time while stationed at Fort Bragg, NC, this was a very refreshing change from some of the prior 007 movies.

Roger Moore started out strong in his first Bond film LIVE AND LET DIE.  There too we had a more conventional villain and great down to earth chase scenes.  The only part of the picture that strayed from this formula was token insertion of the Kananga'a underground command post complete with shark tank.  What is it that Bond villains have against sunshine and fresh air?  Still it was a great film packed with action flowed nicely with Sir George Martin's soundtrack.

THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN definitely suffered sequel-itis.  Once again the film makers felt the need to insert a mega villain.  The definition of a mega villain is someone so wealthy, powerful, and imbued with technology that he feels the need to challenge the world. Mega villains tend to make their homes in old volcanoes, caverns, underwater or on abandoned off shore oil platforms.  GOLDEN GUN begins with an interesting enough plot:  Bond pursuing a high priced hit man. Unfortunately the story evolves into an effort to destroy a solar powered laser housed in a cavernous lair.  To its credit there are some good moments in GOLDEN GUN and it was great to have John Barry back scoring the movie.

From fair we went to just pure bad with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Fantastic pre-credit skiing sequence.  Great theme song.  After that it is all down hill.  Barbara Bach as a Bond girl -- yes.  Bach as a top Soviet intelligence agent -- no.  Much akin to YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, we have a mega villain sending out a ship to swallow NATO vessels.  The difference is that the villainous ship is an oil tanker and the NATO vessels are nuclear submarines.  The talented Kurt Juergens, who was great as the U-Boat commander in THE ENEMY BELOW, is reduced to a rich crank who loves the sea and hates humanity.  The theft of the submarines story would have been okay, but the goofy-looking underwater complex put this film over the edge.  Another loss to this movie was that John Barry did not score the soundtrack.

How can things get worse?  They did with MOONRAKER.  MOONRAKER was a STAR WARS wannabe -- two years too late.  It changed Ian Fleming's original story of a mad scientist's plan to launch a rocket against London into a battle between space shuttles, a mega villain's lair in a space station, and biological warfare.  The pre-title sequence was good.  Unfortunately Richard Kiel reprised his role as Jaws.  In MOONRAKER Jaws is essentially a live action version of Wile E. Coyote constantly being foiled by the Roadrunner (Bond).

Among Jaws' survivals:

1. A free fall thousands of feet from an aircraft without a parachute.
2. A horrific cable car crash.
3. Going over the edge of a tall waterfall.
4. Surviving re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in an unpowered and unshielded compartment of a destroyed space station.

The airplane and space craft special effects were bad.  Maybe we were already spoiled by STAR WARS.  The boat chase and fight scene in Venice was good, but it was just one superiour vignette of an otherwise poor film.  John Barry's score was good, but the theme song was hardly a toe-tapper.

Immediately following MOONRAKER there were very strong rumors that Roger Moore had retired as 007.  Therefore it was surprising in 1981 when theatrical trailers ran FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  This was definitely a back to basics Bond film.  The pre-title sequence had less altitude and was followed by a great hit song.  John Barry's music was missing from this volume, but Bill Conti (THE RIGHT STUFF, NORTH AND SOUTH) score was very credible and flowed nicely with the film.  FOR YOUR EYES ONLY was truly a case of Bond's license renewal.",1182988800,,4777,4.681490384615385
479212,5,630251004X,"Not only is For Your Eyes Only Rogers best, it's one of the best Bond films ever made.  The film has a far more serious tone that had been lacking for a while in the Bond series.  I believe the best 2 factors of the film to be Moore's great performance and the films score.  Moore's 5th outing as Bond shows him fully comfortable in the role and he never looked or acted better.  He is most certainly suave and relaxed here. More so than any other film he ever did for the Bond series.  The scenes with Bond and Melina, played wonderfully by Carole Bouquet, are some of the best scenes from the whole series because they actually feel real.  Those scenes show a good chemistry between Moore and Bouquet.  Also very well done is the score.  Bill Conti's score is really really awesome.  He gave the scenes so much energy.  For instance, the gun barrel sequence at the beginning of every 007 movie, here its very energetic and it sounds so good due to its fast pace.  There is also some very good stunts and effects here.  One of the better Bonds because there is so much less to make it look dated.  This film has aged absolutely wonderful.  Its still hard to believe it was made in 1981.

Of course, in reality, if they were really diving to 400 feet, all would be pitch black, and you would see nothing but their flashlight beams, but why quibble. Topol is teriffic, and almost steals the show.  I can just taste the pistacio nuts.  The Citroen 2CV vs. Mercedes sedan gun cars chase (through the fig groves of Spain) is a hoot.  All in all, a nice coda to the Cold War--nobody wins.  ""I don't have it, and you don't have it--that's detente.""

479215,5,630251004X,"There wasn't much further 007 could go as far as sci-fi wizardry and fantastic characters after the cartoonish MOONRAKER that had seen James Bond propelled into space.

What was called for was a `back to basics' approach that emphasized realism, exotic locations, less gadgetry, down to earth villains and a return to the ruthlessness that Roger Moore had exhibited in movies such as THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. What better way for the filmakers to return Bond to his roots than to tap into original Fleming source material.

Taking characters and situations from not only the Fleming novel FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, but also the keel-hauling sequence from LIVE AND LET DIE writers Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson wove together a complex and enticing cold war spy drama that included some of the staple setpieces underwater and on the slopes that had served the character so well in the past.

As the late John Brosnan noted in his review of the movie this production is essentially one long chase, but in the one solitary tip of the hat to the fantastic plots of the previous two movies, here the stakes could not be higher. Those stakes are the fate of all the British nuclear missiles in the polaris fleet. Forget the kidnapping of a few nuclear warheads in previous movies, here the balance of nuclear brinksmanship is at risk and ultimately the fate of the world.

This movie sports several of my favorite characters from the entire EON canon. Topol plays a brilliant, amiable Greek smuggler named Columbo and the good natured trust and friendship between him and Roger Moore's James Bond is clearly evident in every scene they share together. Noted British television actor Julian Glover plays Greek mercenary and chief villain Kristatos and I love the understated mannerisms and menace that literally oozes from every line. The movie also has one of the series most beautiful women with the appealing Carole Bouquet and this particular Bond fan had a huge crush on Lynn Holly Johnson who portrayed the chipper Bibi Dahl. Add these elements together and place it against the backdrop of the Italian Alps and the Adriatic and you have one of the best entries in the series.",1175904000,15,2204,4.807387862796833

479228,5,630251004X,"Even though Moonraker did make a profit, the ""space"" ending to the film left a bad taste in many people's mouths (we needed Graham Chapman to step in here, say ""This is silly"" and move on to the next bit).  With For Your Eyes Only we see a return to what Bond is at his best.  More than one of the short stories is used here for that purpose (I won't say which in case you have read them and haven't seen the film.  It is a thriller after all).  Roger Moore wasn't sure about a return to the rough nature of the character that was traditional to the books but his performance here is his best in the series.  One sequence (that I will also not ruin for those who haven't seen it) where Bond reminds us about his licence to kill is an icon of the series.  Critics and fans who still don't like Moore as Bond after this film are simply still upset that he's not Sean Connery.  Moore was looked at for the part in the beginning and was liked for it by Ian Fleming himself (he also liked David Niven and Cary Grant).  Connery, of course, did a great job but here we get to see that the authors faith was well deserved.  Critics have also not liked the ""anti-climatic"" style of the ending but I think that they forget that a good action thriller doesn't need to have everything and everyone blow up at the end.  The end has plenty of action and is, very ""Bond"".",1175126400,7,1356,4.141221374045801
479229,5,630251004X,"It seems that the quality of Roger Moore's Bond films was up and down continuously.  After the silliness of ""Moonraker"" I wondered whether Moore was going downhill.  As it turns out the follow up to ""Moonraker"" was one of the best Bond films ever.  In this film Moore plays a serious secret agent in the tradition of ""From Russia with Love,"" which is perhaps the closest previous Bond film in tenor to this film.

The plot of the film is from the heart of the cold war.  A British spy ship is off the coast of Albania gathering information when it is accidentally sank in a bizarre accident.  Included on this ship is the A.T.A.C. system, which is capable of launching submarine ballistic missiles.  The British government doesn't know whether the ship's crew was able to destroy the A.T.A.C., so they try to find the ship.

Soon we meet one of the best casts from any Bond, including the stunningly beautiful Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock, daughter of ocean archeologists that attempt to locate the ship for the British government and are murdered.  Julian Glover plays Aristotle Kristatos, as coldly evil as Christopher Lee in ""The Man with the Golden Gun.""  The equally evil Topol as Columbo aids Kristatos.  Working with Bond is Michael Gothard as Emile Locque, a smuggler but a Greek patriot as well.  The only point of silliness in the cast is the inclusion of the lovely Lynn-Holly Johnson, who was incredibly effective with Robbie Benson in ""Ice Castles.""

Bond struggles figuring out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, aided by Melina all the way.  Moore's Bond in this film is serious with minimal one liners, as close as Moore ever got to Sean Connery.  The gadgetry is minimal with much of the action focused on Moore in one of his most physical roles.  The scenes flow smoothly, with good action throughout while keeping a plausible story line.

While I usually find a lot to complain about regarding the technical aspects of Bond films, in this one I'll only point out one obvious flaw.  Melina talks about how she has been around the world with her parents as they have investigated underwater archeological sites.  Clearly Melina is an expert diver as we see in several scenes.  Yet when Bond and she go looking for the A.T.A.C., Bond explains patronizingly to her regarding the air mix they'll use and other details regarding the dive.  Melina should have been an expert in this area, but in order to show how knowledgeable Bond is he explains what should have been obvious to Melina.  A minor point that was only minimally distracting.

Following the tradition of Bond films, the music for this film was by then mega-star Sheena Easton, filmed with bare shoulders during the opening credits.  The opening credits for this movie were not nearly as inspired as the movie itself, but another minor point given the excellence of the movie.

Most Bond films are enjoyable to watch, even when they are silly.  Fortunately this one is a good spy film with Roger Moore at the peak of his game.  This Bond film is one of the best of the 20+ Bond films and worthy of having in any film collection.

Enjoy!",1173657600,3,3130,4.6727605118829985
479230,4,630251004X,"One of the most revered of the Roger Moore Bond stints, this film starts with the much-maligned Bond vs. Blofeld mini-meet teaser.  Blofeld is back for about seven minutes trying to kill Bond by trapping him in a radio-controlled helicopter, only to see Bond outsmart him one last time.  This is considered a stupid start to a superior Bond outing, but I have to say I really don't mind it; Bond clinging to the outside of a wildly careening helicopter, completely at the mercy of his old foe, makes for an exciting deathtrap.  I also like the fact that Blofeld uses Bond's visit to his deceased wife's gravesite against him, since, of course it was Blofeld who had her killed.  The teaser is horribly ruined right at the end when Bond, who gains the advantage at the last second and has his wife's murderer at his mercy, starts throwing out joke lines, and is entirely too whimsical given the situation.  And Blofeld's final bit of dialogue is awful.

Enough about the teaser (and let's skip over Sheena Easton's image being allowed to invade the opening credits), onto the film proper: it's undeniably terrific as a more realistic approach to Bond.  The plot is still slick and streamlined, with lots of fun twists, explosions, car chases, gorgeous women, ritzy and/or exotic locales, assassins, gadgets, and breathtaking stunts.  So.  Where then does the realism come in?  It's, uh, well hmm, it's rather difficult to pin down at first, but would become, I think, more apparent if watched on a double-bill with Die Another Day.

In For Your Eyes Only, many of the extended action sequences are slowed down to create tension, rather than over-the-top action.  I think back to the lightning fast jump-cutting all throughout On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and then I think of the simmering tension of the mountain-climbing mayhem near the end of For Your Eyes Only.  Before that, there are three watery deathtrap sequences in a row for Bond to survive: hand-to-hand combat with a thug in a deepwater diving suit 400 feet below, where movement is slow and awkward; next, a mini-sub duel involving two unwieldy vehicles; finally, a keelhauling sequence where villain Kristatos pulls Bond and his lady of the 80's across the same coral reef three times just to spill enough blood to lure in the sharks.  There is, about all this, a strangely unhurried pace that should continuously drag the film down--make it a dull Bond flick.  But it doesn't.  If movement underwater, and climbing a tall mountain while the bad guy tries to scrape you off the side, are keynotes to the script, you might as well find a way to make it work, by sacrificing loud super-speed for trembling tension.  Then they praise you for realism in Bond, so you can't lose.

Anyway, the plot is splendid.  Bond gets manipulated by the villain into chasing the wrong man, while the actual head creepo closes in on A.T.A.C., a revolutionary surveillance system that sank off Albania in a spyship disguised as a fishing trawler.  He wants to sell it to the Russians so they can use it against its British makers.  When he murders a man named Havelock just to prevent him from getting to A.T.A.C. first, his beautiful (are you shocked?) daughter picks up a crossbow and targets revenge.  Carole Bouquet is one of my favourite Bond ladies, and of course Bond thinks so too once they meet, though he's troubled by her bloodthirstiness.

Final word:  it's one of Roger Moore's best Bond films, though it is not as thrilling or outrageous as most other 007 extravaganzas.  Moore is suave, if perhaps a little underwhelming at times; he seems quite assured in the role here, and it's somewhat delightful that the army of trained killers he wades through in this adventure can't ruffle him half as much as the young flirtatious figure-skater who jumps in his lap every chance she gets.  For Your Eyes Only is a classy, seamless production that I enjoy every time I power it up.",1172361600,6,3935,4.775480059084195
479231,4,630251004X,"For Your Eyes Only is showing its age a bit now. At the time a hugely welcome return to basics after the leaden FX spectacle of Moonraker (the second remake of You Only Live Twice in a row for the series), it still holds up as one of the best of Roger Moore's Bonds, but its faults are much more apparent than they once were. Among them is the tendency to undercut everything with unfunny little jokes (a scoreboard keeping count of thugs Bond knocks out, Bond giving a bemused royal wave to pursuing thugs, and a horrendous cameo from a Maggie Thatcher lookalike in the end), some flat studio work (no disguising the fact that the mountaintop Greek monastery is just a Pinewood set), a dated Bill Conti score and a comic relief nympho nymphet Lynn Holly Johnson constantly throwing herself at a disinterested Bond. Luckily, the pluses more than compensate - a stronger plot than usual for the Moore efforts, at least one cold-blooded murder, and a very welcome absence of gadgets until the postscript that ensures that Bond has to extricate himself with his own wits in some pretty good setpieces. Best among them is a mountaineering sequence where he uses his bootlaces - not steel bootlaces, just common bootlaces - to save himself in an old mountaineers trick.

Although the original DVD wasn't the most fully loaded disc on the market, there's less of an upgrade in terms of extras than meets the eye on this 2-disc 'ultimate edition.' Alongside Roger Moore's new audio commentary there are two deleted scenes, one of them a welcome addition that brings a bit of tension to Bond and Melina's relationship as she chastises him over his nocturnal activities, but the three new featurettes are little more than fairly raw behind the scenes footage while the multi-angle alternate versions of Bond's cold-blooded killing of Loque are particularly badly laid out.

Lost in the wreck is a top secret missile launching device which soon becomes 'something of value' in a characteristic British-Russian confrontation...

007 is seen caught in a cold-blooded feud between two Greek ex-partisans... He has to recover a transmitter that could fall into the wrong hands... He is sent to climb up the cliffs below an abandoned monastery complex, and is aided by a vigorous and decided sharpshooter whose expertise with a crossbow proved vital...

Throughout the mission 007 is aided by the brave Melina Havelock, a perfect Bond heroine determined to avenge her parents at all costs... Melina Havelock is a combination of Tilly Masterson from 'Goldfinger' and Domino from 'Thunderball.' Melina comes upon a much bigger plot, involving 007 and a Russian-British race to regain the A.T.A.C.

As Bond, Roger Moore finally gets his hair messed up, and more... He is at the mercy of a bald figure in a wheelchair who controls his destiny; chased by ski-borne motorcycles; assailed by spear-carrying fishermen and unlucky hockey players; attacked by sharks and enemy divers; tied up and dragged behind a boat along the sharp corals...

The film succeeds in introducing many mysterious characters... Three of them are:

Milos Columbo (Topol) who becomes the incarnation of Bond's old friend Kerim Bey... Known as 'The Dove,' Columbo is a pistachio-chewing Greek smuggler, ex-resistance fighter, and casino owner on the Greek island in the Aegean Sea... Between him and Kristatos, there is blood feud dating back to World War II, when both fought the Nazis as resistance fighters on Crete...

Ari Kristatos (Julian Glover) who manages to hide his treacherous nature behind a veneer of sophistication... Kristatos comes across as the most believable Bond villain in years... He introduces himself as an enthusiastic Anglophile who was a resistance fighter during the Second World War, and apparently uses Bond to murder his smuggling rival while scheming to please the KGB...

Bibi Dahl (Lynn Holly Johnson) who would do anything for Bond! She is the American figure-skating prodigy who meets 007 in Cortina D'Ampezzo, where at one point was invitingly in 007's bed...

Hate and revenge play significant part in this twelfth James Bond film... ""For Your Eyes Only"" follows the adventure and exotic appeal of earlier Bond movies like 'From Russia with Love' and 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.

This time he's racing against the clock to find the A.T.A.C. device(wasn't this the same doodad from The Spy Who Loved Me?) in a sunken ship before some schmuck gets it first and sells it to that rotten commie, General Gogol.  Bond teams up with a chick hellbent on revenge.  Bond's hormones must be at an all time low coz this is probably the first woman he comes across who he doesn't try to seduce within the first five minutes of meeting her.  In fact, he doesn't try at all, but still gets her in the sack!!  He also turns down the advances of a figure skater, but it's insinuated that she's jailbait...and Bond knows better than to mess with jailbait!  He also teams up with a smuggler played by Topol, who you might remember as Dr. Zarkoff in Flash Gordon.  Bond dodges bullets, bad guys and jetlag on his journey for the A.T.A.C.  Of course he manages to get another skiing scene in there as well.  Julian Glover isn't that threatening of a villain, but his henchmen are cool.  This one has probably the coolest pre-credit sequence of the entire Bond series with Moore's first and only encounter with arch-nemesis Blofeld.  Really cool scene.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is the first time since Moore's own MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN that Bond was really grounded in reality.  Everything that occurs in this film is within the realm of believeability.

The secret to its success is in removing the tradtional arsenal of gadgetry and forcing Bond to rely instead on his survival skills.  Right from the get-go, we know we are in for something different when Bond's new souped-up gadget car blows up before he even gets to hop in!  Throughout the movie, Bond is left to his own gut instincts to survive. Nowhere in the film is this better seen than in the extended ski slope chase.  From the get go, he loses his gun, and must therefore out-think and out-ski his would-be assassin through a series of fun chases down the long ski slope.

In addition to this goodness is a fun car chase where Bond, having lost his car, has to make do with a Voklswagen Beetle to make his getaway.  There is also some underwater action including a submersible vehicle fight, and a deep sea salvage dive.  And the film climaxes in an amazing cliff-climbing mission to an isolated fortress!

The movie foregoes the global domination themes of the previous two films in favor of some cold-war espionage involving a top secret device that went down with a ship.  It is a race between Bond and competing agencies to recover the box first.  Nice to have something more believable to follow!

The film's only weak point is Bond girl Carol Bouqet - she is easy on the eyes, but her delivery is only a few notches above the dreadful Barbara Bach from SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Also, the villain is pretty plain and boring.

But, all that pales in comparison to the more even keeled and down-to-earth action and plotting the movie has to offer.  To top it all off, you get to see Bond's final showdown with Blofeld in the movies opening sequence!  It's all good, baby!",1125273600,2,2093,4.5092838196286475

479309,5,630251004X,"THE MOVIE
There wasn't much further 007 could go as far as sci-fi wizardry and fantastic characters after the cartoonish MOONRAKER that had seen James Bond propelled into space.
What was called for was a `back to basics' approach that emphasized realism, exotic locations, less gadgetry, down to earth villains and a return to the ruthlessness that Roger Moore had exhibited in movies such as THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. What better way for the filmakers to return Bond to his roots than to tap into original Fleming source material.
Taking characters and situations from not only the Fleming novel FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, but also the keel-hauling sequence from LIVE AND LET DIE writers Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson wove together a complex and enticing cold war spy drama that included some of the staple setpieces underwater and on the slopes that had served the character so well in the past.
As the late John Brosnan noted in his review of the movie this production is essentially one long chase, but in the one solitary tip of the hat to the fantastic plots of the previous two movies, here the stakes could not be higher. Those stakes are the fate of all the British nuclear missiles in the polaris fleet. Forget the kidnapping of a few nuclear warheads in previous movies, here the balance of nuclear brinksmanship is at risk and ultimately the fate of the world.
This movie sports several of my favorite characters from the entire EON canon. Topol plays a brilliant, amiable Greek smuggler named Columbo and the good natured trust and friendship between him and Roger Moore's James Bond is clearly evident in every scene they share together. Noted British television actor Julian Glover plays Greek mercenary and chief villain Kristatos and I love the understated mannerisms and menace that literally oozes from every line. The movie also has one of the series most beautiful women with the appealing Carole Bouquet and this particular Bond fan had a huge crush on Lynn Holly Johnson who portrayed the chipper Bibi Dahl. Add these elements together and place it against the backdrop of the Italian Alps and the Adriatic and you have one of the best entries in the series.

THE DVD
This DVD was one of the first wave of the newly refurbished Bond DVDs (most had previously been released in the snapper cases). Arriving in stores in Oct. 1999 I quickly snatched them up and devoured them.
Whereas the later two sets all had DVDs with two documentaries on them this one has just the one on the Making of the movie. For Bond fans this is a true treat because we get to see new on camera interviews with the likes of Rick Sylvestor, Topol and Lynn Holly Johnson. Narrated by Patrick MacNee it's both breezy and fascinating.
With only the one documentary and the standard selectioon of trailers, music and radio spots, we do have two audio commentaries (rather than the one that appeared in the later sets). Unfortunately these are the spliced together kind which means that often what the interviewees are talking about is not relevant to what is playing out on screen. Whereas this means we get a lot of information it does tend to get a bit dry and I would have preferred a scene specific track with participants sitting together in a studio discussing the movie as it plays.
Still...this is a great movie and the packaging isn't too shabby. For the time (late 1999) these DVDs were viewed as on-top as far as special features go because at that time most movies being released were bare-bones editions.
Highly recommended.

UPDATE- It should be noted that there is a rerelease of this movie coming up on DVD which will feature a newly recorded scene specific audio commentary by Bond actor Roger Moore. So, it may well be worth holding off on a purchase until these Ultimate Editions are released towards the end of 2006.",1114041600,38,3858,4.722551928783383

He is still the same old coot who make the funny faces when he is surprised. But what gets me the most in this film is the disposal of Bonds biggest nemises Blofeld in the begininng of the film. NO, NO, NO, NO. That Aint right. I don't care that they killed Blofeld but the way they did it was all wrong. Blofeld was Bonds biggest enemy, hell he killed Bonds wife, and they kill him off in a quick five minute stint in the beggining of the movie. Blofeld should have been saved until an apic number of movies had been reached, say the 20th movie.

Moving onto the rest of the movie, fans remark about how it is better by inserting a diffrent kind of ending then the rest of the movies. Ok thats good, I can accept that, but it was the lack of any real action in the end that ruined it for me. He never ahs a real showdown with the bad guy, HE FREAKING SHOOTS HIM WHILE HE IS RUNNING AWAY. James Bond does not take cheep shots. I don't know that just pisses me off a little bit.

One good thing is that they take some stuff from the Flemming books, actually only one thing that I could catch, and that was a scene from the book Live and Let Die. Bond and the girl are tied up and dragged behind a boat going over sharp corral. Ok that part was alright, but then they go to the parrot saving the day by telling them where the villian went. Can everybody say CHEESE?

My advice skip the rest of the film in the series till you get to The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton. That film is very diffrent from the majority of the series and Bond is no longer an old coot that needs to take his medication.

479312,4,630251004X,"This is clearly the best Moore version of James Bond. Moore finally takes his role seriously and behaves more like a real secret service agent than he did in his previous, mostly comical, turns as 007. I actually think this is Roger Moore's very best acting turn. Which also makes this is one of the very best Bond films.
As usual the scenery is breathtaking, the colors vivid, and the ubiquitous, classic, and certainly cliched by now, ski chases, car chases and underwater encounters are extremely well-done.
This film shows much better attention to detail than in any  previous Bond film. It feels like everyone involved decided to give it their best and not just make a Bond movie but a good suspense drama. Which is why it's so enjoyable to watch. I guess the best clue that this movie will be different is the opening scene in which Bond gets the better of Blofeld once and for all in an exciting helicopter ride.
Let's not forget the believable story that doesn't fall into the ridiculous ""taking over the world"" category. The characters are well-defined and they're not allowed to fall into the classic Keystone Kops buffoons we've so often seen in Bond films. Another welcome change is the absence of the farcical Bond stalker who pops up everywhere and fails time and again to get his man like the coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons.
One of the few negatives is Carole Bouquet who, although certainly more than beautiful enough, is much too taciturn to make a compelling Bond girl looking to avenge the death of her parents at the hands of criminals. This role would have benefited from the presence of a more assertive actress.
It would, of course, be possible to nitpick at this film but there are few bad things to say about this enjoyable outing. Check it out; it's watchable without even knowing who James Bond is.",1105142400,,1828,4.694704049844237
479313,5,630251004X,"This film was far and away Roger Moore's best Bond film.  It's also an incredibly stark contrast to its immediate predecessor, ""Moonraker"".  ""Moonraker"" followed the ""Goldfinger"" blueprint - an almost outrageously villianous villain (supported by an even more outrageously unusual henchman), involved in the most large scale, diabolical of plots.  It's almost a shame that ""Goldfinger"" was such a success (well... not quite, since ""Goldfinger"" was such a superb movie), since it gave rise to a real trend for such over-the-top villians and over-the-top threats in the Bond series.  That sort of thing can work, when done masterfully, as it was in ""Goldfinger"", but it's awfully hard to keep to that level of artistic greatness.  ""For Your Eyes Only"" is very much more like ""Dr. No"", or ""From Russia With Love"".  It's a believable film.  It's the kind of espionage thriller that you really believe could almost be based on a true story.  There are no comic book villains.  There is no B-movie serial threat.  This is the kind of thing that feels like it could plausibly take place in the shadow world of spies.  The plot concerns a secret, high tech submarine tracking and communication system.  If the Soviets should get their hands on a sample of this system, then a vital component of NATO defense technology would be compromised.  Yet even if the Russians had gotten the A.T.A.C. system; even if Bond had failed in his mission, it's the kind of thing that most people would never even have heard about until fifty years later when the political situation had changed, technology had advanced, and the relevant documents had been declassified.  You can easily suspend disbelief and imagine that this sort of thing could happen (allowing for a bit of dramatic license that is).

This grittier, more realistic, Cold War spy thriller story was a refreshing change from the comic book Bond of ""Moonraker"", or even ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".  It was a much needed return to the less flamboyant Bond of the Fleming novels.  It's almost a pity Roger Moore didn't make his exit with this movie.  It would have been a fantastic swan song, and far better than the unworthy ""A View to a Kill"", which only proved that in terms of artistic success, the excess of the ""Goldfinger"" formula was the exception rather than the rule.",1101340800,3,2313,4.857142857142857
479314,5,630251004X,"This is by far my favorite Bond film of the series. Roger Moore is at his best in this film, and it is definately his best performance as Bond. Roger Moore brings a lot of humor to the movie as he usually does, and he shows his serious bond side in several parts of the movie. This movie has a excellent plot, two spectacular chase scenes, some of the most beautiful locations, and above all it keeps you guessing who the real main villian throughout the movie.

  The cast in my opinion is one of the best in the series. First you have Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock who is one of the most beautiful bond girls in the entire series. Julian Glover who plays Aristotle Kristatos was equally as evil as Christopher Lee in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"". I also liked the assortment of villians in the movie such as Locque, and Eric Kriegler. Then you have Topal who plays Columbo the columbian smuggler who turns out to be Bonds ally.

The plot of the movie is based on the A.T.A.C device which can launch submarine missiles on any desired target including your own cities! It also includes Melina seeking revenge for the death of her parents, who soon joins Bond on his mission. I also thought the young skater Bibi who was very cute brought a lot drama to the movie as well.

  The only flaw I found in this movie was the lack of gadgets. I can see why they didn't have many in this film. They wanted to return to a more serious Bond who really and truely looked like a spy. I have always been a fan of Q's high tech gadgets that get Bond out of tight situations.

It see's the demise of Bond's old enemy Blofeld, who had become quite a fixture in the series. The incredible theme song by Sheena Easton is a credit to the movie.

Bond is once again called on to solve the mystery of the destruction of a British ship and its crew.

He is brought together with a sultry Greek beauty Melina Havalok (Carole Bouquet), who is out to revenge the brutal murder of her parents. They are brought up against drug cartels with links to the Soviet Bloc. Melina's first act is to take out - with her crossbow- the vicious Cuban assassin who dispatched her parents, before trying to find out who was behind this all. It is Bond who needs to get her to slow down, with promises that justice will be done.

At least most of us knew then who the villains of the world where then - and these included Castro's tyrannical regime in Cuba. This was before so many people where brainwashed by Noam `Wormtongue' Chomsky and his ilk, to regard tyrants and terrorists as heroes and those who fight them as villains

And Bond's run-in with the villains brings him up against various East bloc thugs.

Bond has to find out who the real drug lord and killer, who is working hand in glove with the Soviets and Cubans, and it is not who he initially though it was. Lots of thrilling action.

Bond needs to find out where the ship has sunk in order to recover the ATAC system: a computer that tracks all of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines and has the ability of ordering the launch of their nuclear arsenals. Fearing that the system may come into the hands of terrorists or the Soviets, Bond is given his marching orders. Bond soon realizes that he's running out of time and so obtains the help of the always needed beauty: in this case played by Carole Bouquet. After travelling to Spain, Italy, and Greece (taking part in Olympic training and olive harvesting on the way), Bond is hard pressed as to who has the ATAC. Upon obtaining the truth from one he presumed to be an enemy, Bond goes to a Greek monastery perched high on a mountain for the final show down.

  This is probably one of the best Bonds in that Bond here is actually a spy and isn't relying on any far-fetched gadgets to save the day. The film is action-packed and has more mystery and suspense than the other typical Bond films. The reason for that is that the true villain isn't immediately identified and this has Bond actually perplexed for a while.  On a final note, it's the last Bond film in which Blofeld appears (however briefly) as a character.

  This is one of my favorite Bond films in the entire franchise. Moore keeps up his stiff upper lip in the traditional style and the script has all the humor and wit of other great Bond films. I recommend it.",1091577600,,1740,4.512738853503185

 Bond tracks down a submarine stelth device,and teams up with a revenge filled Greek heiress Melina Havalok(Carole Bouquet)whose parents were killed locating it. Filled with memorable scenes including a chase in Melina's car(a small and slow car, as opposed to Bonds' gadget filled cars),A spectacular ski chase, a dangerous coral reef escape, and an attack on the villian's lair including Bond dangerously climbing up a mountain. Topel shines as a dangerous smuggler who turns out to be Bond's ally, as well as Lynn Holly-Johnson as Bibi Dahl, a not so innocent nymphette who's the first Bond girl he turns down.

 Although the cheesy tone would return by the time of A View To A Kill,FYEO is a reminder that Roger Moore could play Bond with a license to kill.",1091059200,,1039,4.787709497206704
479345,5,630251004X,"James Bond films can be divided into two camps.  Some have over-the-top villains and larger-than-life plots, while others are down to earth, gritty spy adventures.  ""For Your Eyes Only"" falls squarely in the latter camp.  This characteristic has earned it praise from those who enjoy Bond movies with a more realistic air, while those who prefer the more fantastic deride it as boring.
For my own part, I find ""For Your Eyes Only"" to be the best Roger Moore film and indeed better than most of the Connery and Brosnan films as well.  That is not to say the movie is without flaws.  The ""heavy"" and the ""henchman"" are a somewhat underwhelming, the score is a little too pop, and Bond's flirtation with a young skater strains credulity.  However, these minor complaints are overcome with thrilling chases, superb action, tight storytelling, beautiful locations, and intense suspense that is sorely lacking in most Bond films.
On the whole, ""For Your Eyes Only"" may not be what you expect, but it is one of the best of the series.
DVD: Thankfully, MGM gave this one the full 5.1 sound treatment.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack has its jarring moments, especially in the rear channels during the pre-title sequence and when Bond gets caught at Gonzales' lair.  The extra features are informative and fun, as has been the case with the other Bond films.",1089763200,2,1348,4.85589519650655
479346,4,630251004X,"In 1979, the James Bond series had officially ""jumped the shark (i.e. reached a turning point which signaled a downward spiral.)"" with the campy, over-the-top, MOONRAKER (A guilty pleasure of mine, to be frank). Although he had a blockbuster on his hands, producer Cubby Broccoli had the forsight to see that the Bond series would crash under the weight of huge sets and bad puns.  Thus, a back- to-basic approach was in order for the harder-edged 1980's with FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, from the title of Ian Fleming's collection of Bond short stories, is noted by Bond fans as the first from the ""Michael G. Wilson Era"" of the series.  Wilson, a writer, co-producer, and Broccoli's step son had sighted the darker, more realistic FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as his personal favorite. Along with long time Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum and first time director John Glen (an editor from the series), their recipe of grittier action sequences, amid exotic locations would be a template for the series that would extend into Pierce Brosnan's epics.

Although I don't consider FOR YOUR EYES ONLY in the panthanon of, say, GOLDFINGER, (and despite what you read here, the high adventure plot line is closer to the botboilers of Alistair McClain then it is to Ian Fleming's), the movie is a fun ride.  It is also, perhaps the first time many began to stop worrying and like Roger Moore as 007.  I don't know if it was Moore's advancing age or his fuller hair style, but here he's clearly not the same twit who waltzed through MOONRAKER. His Bond, for once, has to huff and puff his way out of a situation instead of chiefly relying on a raised eyebrow.  He still a charmer who rather use his wits than his fists, but when the going gets tough he'll use a full clip of his Walter PPK without hesitation. That's James Bond!

Years ago I was floored by the old CBS-FOX laserdisc version of this movie.  Although panned and scanned, the disc's stereo sound mix was thunderous.  This new DVD is sharper despite some flaws due to the film stock's age, but  retains the surround sound theatrics that keeps 007's 12th outing state of the art in a constantly improving digital landscape.",1082937600,2,2184,4.69109947643979
479347,4,630251004X,"Roger Moore's fifth James Bond film, ""For Your Eyes Only,"" harks back to the simpler thriller mode of the first three entries in the series, a welcome relief after the far-fetched, and often laughable travesty that was ""Moonraker.""
With his smirk on hold, Moore gets down and dirty for once, even exhibiting a touch of heartless sadism in a scene involving a villain whose car is teetering on the edge of a cliff. The plot, involving a sunken British ship whose cargo contains an important nuclear device, is comparatively down to earth for a change, and there's the great Israeli actor, Topol of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" fame, as a good/bad guy who seems to inspire the often wooden Moore to new acting heights.
The action is well-staged, including a memorable mountain climbing sequence, but on the downside too much derring-do occurs on skis, inviting unfavorable comparisons to the superior snow bound action of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" the black sheep in the series whose memory hangs heavy over this film thanks to the pre-title sequence (which I find unbearably silly, unlike the remaining film) with Bond placing flowers on his late wife's grave.
Also preventing this film from being fully bonded is the score by Bill Conti of ""Rocky"" fame. It has a tinny, generic quality that reminds me of the canned music found in old sports themed short subjects. Despite those faults, this is, along with ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" Moore's best film in the series.",1077148800,2,1465,4.864
479348,5,630251004X,"While it is debateable which actor made the best James Bond, ""For Your Eyes Only"" is the best Bond film, hands down.  The film works so well because it retains all that is attractive about the Bond series, while avoiding the weaknesses.  Unlike in most other Bond films, the plot is a realistic espionage and underworld story. There is no villain out to take over the world.  The believability of the story enhances the viewer's enjoyment of the film.
The portrayal of Bond himself is more realistic as well. Unlike in many of the other films, he seems like he could be a real secret agent.  He doesn't ludicrously stand out--like when he is sent to the Caribbean or Japan.  The sexist features of other Bond films are not found here.  Carole Bouquet, as Melina Havelock, is a strong and courageous woman, while still breathtakingly gorgeous. Columbo (played by Topol) is a very appealing character as well.  He is a passionate, deeply human man, with immense charisma. One would like to be friends with Columbo.(Columbo is Bond's ally.  He doesn't work with Kristatos, as the previous review said).
""For Your Eyes Only"" also has a very human, sympathetic quality to it.  The theme of ""just revenge"" is convincingly presented.  It is easy to sympathize with Melina as she seeks to avenge her parent's murder--she saw them killed with her own eyes.
Finally, ""For Your Eyes Only"" contains the best single scene in the entire Bond series.  The sequence where Roger Moore pushes the villain Loque's car off a cliff, with Loque in it: ""You left this with Ferrara, I believe"", is priceless.  Moore's icy coldness, and cool satisfaction in killing Loque, is extremely satisfying--just what a man in Bond's position should be like.",1075161600,5,1723,4.843003412969283
479349,5,630251004X,"It seems that the quality of Roger Moore's Bond films was up and down continuously.  After the silliness of ""Moonraker"" I wondered whether Moore was going downhill.  As it turns out the follow up to ""Moonraker"" was one of the best Bond films ever.  In this film Moore plays a serious secret agent in the tradition of ""From Russia with Love,"" which is perhaps the closest previous Bond film in tenor to this film.
The plot of the film is from the heart of the cold war.  A British spy ship is off the coast of Albania gathering information when it is accidentally sank in a bizarre accident.  Included on this ship is the A.T.A.C. system, which is capable of launching submarine ballistic missiles.  The British government doesn't know whether the ship's crew was able to destroy the A.T.A.C., so they try to find the ship.
Soon we meet one of the best casts from any Bond, including the stunningly beautiful Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock, daughter of ocean archeologists that attempt to locate the ship for the British government and are murdered.  Julian Glover plays Aristotle Kristatos, as coldly evil as Christopher Lee in ""The Man with the Golden Gun.""  The equally evil Topol as Columbo aids Kristatos.  Working with Bond is Michael Gothard as Emile Locque, a smuggler but a Greek patriot as well.  The only point of silliness in the cast is the inclusion of the lovely Lynn-Holly Johnson, who was incredibly effective with Robbie Benson in ""Ice Castles.""
Bond struggles figuring out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, aided by Melina all the way.  Moore's Bond in this film is serious with minimal one liners, as close as Moore ever got to Sean Connery.  The gadgetry is minimal with much of the action focused on Moore in one of his most physical roles.  The scenes flow smoothly, with good action throughout while keeping a plausible story line.
While I usually find a lot to complain about regarding the technical aspects of Bond films, in this one I'll only point out one obvious flaw.  Melina talks about how she has been around the world with her parents as they have investigated underwater archeological sites.  Clearly Melina is an expert diver as we see in several scenes.  Yet when Bond and she go looking for the A.T.A.C., Bond explains patronizingly to her regarding the air mix they'll use and other details regarding the dive.  Melina should have been an expert in this area, but in order to show how knowledgeable Bond is he explains what should have been obvious to Melina.  A minor point that was only minimally distracting.
Following the tradition of Bond films, the music for this film was by then mega-star Sheena Easton, filmed with bare shoulders during the opening credits.  The opening credits for this movie were not nearly as inspired as the movie itself, but another minor point given the excellence of the movie.
Most Bond films are enjoyable to watch, even when they are silly.  Fortunately this one is a good spy film with Roger Moore at the peak of his game.  This Bond film is one of the best of the 20+ Bond films and worthy of having in any film collection.",1074643200,6,3116,4.670329670329671
479350,5,630251004X,"It would be very difficult to play James Bond any better than Roger Moore did in this film. This was the first Bond film that I saw in the theater and I instantly became a fan. This film has all of the qualities that make the Bond films great: scenery, exciting plot and great stunt work. The only disappointment is that there was not enough action with the Lotus (what happens to it is hilarious, however). The opening sequence is my favorite of the series.",1074124800,,458,4.4
479351,5,630251004X,"If this had been Roger Moore's _only_ Bond film, he'd have gone down in the history of the series for it. Unfortunately, by the time the franchise got around to this one, Moore's Bond had filled the series with a whole lot of silliness (which, in all fairness, had begun at least as early as _Diamonds Are Forever_).
Here, for the first, last, and only time in Moore's run as Bond, he's the icy-cool secret agent envisioned by Ian Fleming. There's a crisp plot here, an engaging heroine played with much derring-do by Carole Bouquet, villains who have more in common with real crime lords than with Doctor Doom, and the wonderful Topol.
The only bits that don't ring true are the ones with the teenaged figure skater. Everything else is right on. If you want to know more about the plot, read the other reviews, which summarize it nicely.
I go way back with Bond. I was born just before _Goldfinger_ was released and one of the very first songs I learned was 'Finner' (as I then called the movie's title track). As far as I'm concerned, no one is going to top Sean Connery in the role; the magic of the first few films (especially our first view of Connery's face in _Dr. No_, as he lights his cigarette and says, 'Bond. James Bond.') isn't going to be recaptured with anyone else. (Nor with Connery. If you haven't seen _Never Say Never Again_, don't.)
But Moore does nearly as well here as Dalton does in _Licence to Kill_. (I like Pierce Brosnan but he hasn't really gotten to be as chilling and deadly as Bond is in these two films.) If you want to see Moore play Bond for real, this is the one to see.",1072742400,3,1606,4.39261744966443

IN For Your Eyes Only,  it is evident that Roger is nearing the end of his reign as the world's most debonair double 00 agent, but that does not mean it is a weak entry.  After Moonraker, Cubby Broccoli decided that BOND needed to go back to his roots as an agent and not an astronaut.  I agree and this Bond film establishes Moore as a great actor.  He leaves the Humor at the door for this film and it pays off greatly.  Bond is supposed to be a Cold Killer and not a comedian/agent.  This film revolves around two crimelords, Kristatos and Columbo, who are trying to get the ATAC.  The ATAC is a device that is capable of setting of deadly missles from afar and promises the one who has it  great power.  The atac is on a British ship that sinks at the beginning due to an explosive mine.  This is one of Bond's most dangerous and entertaining missions.  John Glen is truly the greatest director of any Bond film.  This movie was so good that Roger Moore would get more respect for his portrayal of Bond if her retired after this one.  I am glad he didn't though because I like him.  I still think Timothy Dalton was the best James Bond ever though.  No one will ever come close to him.

479394,4,630251004X,"Sean Connery is the only 007 as far as I'm concerned. All others are just pretenders. But FOR YOUR EYES ONLY compels me to salute Roger Moore for an exemplary effort.
A British spy ship is lost in the Med along with all hands aboard and some super-duper, top secret, submarine communication gear. The salvage expert employed by Her Majesty's government to locate the wreck is murdered along with his wife. Bond is brought in to find out which villain has an apparent interest in recovering the device for fun and profit, and, of course, to foil the plot by getting there first.
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is perhaps 20 to 30 minutes too long, part of that time taken up by the screen appearance of superfluous Bond Babe Bibi Dahl (Lynn-Holly Johnson), a hyperactive and sexually precocious teenage gymnast/figure skater who has designs on 007's virtue. The role was so pointless that I was left wondering what debt was called in for the director or producer to write her into the script. The other Bond Babes, Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet), the daughter of the assassinated salvager, and Countess Lisl von Schlaf from Liverpool (Cassandra Harris), at least had the benefit of maturity. Indeed, I would like to have seen more of the inscrutable Melina and her deadly crossbow.
The movie as a whole is redeemed by a succession of cleverly contrived and artfully choreographed perils - in the air, on the snow, on and under the sea, and against a sheer cliff face - thrust upon Bond to test his sangfroid. Indeed, our hero's feats of escape and derring-do are so inventive and absorbing that the conclusion of the film is almost anti-climactic. Julian Glover is particularly effective as the Bad Guy, especially when he goes trolling for sharks.
And keep an eye out for a depiction of Prime Minister Thatcher doing domestic chores in an apron. That bit was inspired.",1065657600,,1858,4.773291925465839
479395,4,630251004X,"Following the release of MOONRAKER, arguably the most laughable film in the entire 007 series, Cubby Broccoli & Co. bring Bond back down to earth for this finely crafted thriller - and a fresh look, with new director, John Glen.
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY opens with a pre-credits sequence that winks at many of the earliest Bond films.  It truly sets the tone, yet is wholly unrelated to the plot of the movie.  For certain this sequence has at turns over the years been praised and harangued by avid fans of the series.  Commencing, our hero places flowers at the grave of his murdered wife, Tracy.  Then a shot of the tombstone- the words, ""We have all the time in the world,"" certainly portend a comparatively somber tone with regards to Bond as portrayed by Moore: a softer display in contrast with the usual flippant playfulness. As well, this is a linking reference to the earlier 007 film, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  Within moments, Bond finds himself trapped on a frightful helicopter ride, choreographed by a wheelchair-bound, kitty-petting bald man with remote controls.  He's here unnamed, but anyone familiar with the pre-Moore era Bond films immediately recognize this personage as none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld - the notorious megalomaniac who, incidentally, is Tracy's murderer.  Most satisfyingly and most befitting, this bad guy gets unceremoniously dumped here for good.  I guess my only regret is that Sean Connery's Bond wasn't given the pleasure.
Following the credits sequence - the lovely title song, unfortunately weakly sung by Sheena Easton - Bond's mission takes off after the ATAK, a secret coding device, is sunk to the bottom of the sea when the ship carrying it hits a mine.  The British Secret Service charges James Bond with retrieving it before it falls into the wrong hands.  The Russians, who are intent on retrieving the device, direct their local contact in Greece to recover it at all costs.  Part of this cost includes the murders of Sir Timothy Havelock and his wife aboard their yacht on the Mediterranean.  Before long, Bond encounters their beautiful daughter, Melina, who's on her own quest to find the group of individuals behind it all.  And since, ""Greek women, like Electra, always avenge their loved ones,"" Melina manages to perforate her parents' assassin with a crossbow before Bond is able to question him regarding involvement with the ATAK.
The quest, nevertheless, does eventually lead our favorite spy to the real villain behind it all: Aristotle Kristatos (Julian Glover), an exceptionally sly and dangerous adversary. His henchman, Emile Locque (Michael Gothard), though he never utters a word during the whole of this movie, is one of the most intensely menacing of all the Bond foes in the series.
Though the lovely Miss Havelock shares the same adversary as Bond, she is working from a completely different angle.  The result is an enticing romantic relationship.  Commander Bond also gets assistance on this difficult mission from some unexpected quarters:  Columbo (Topol), head of a smuggling operation, and the smuggler's lover, Countess Lisl von Schlaf (the late Cassandra Harris- who, coincidentally, was married to future James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan at the making of this movie).
The pace of this movie is perfect - the scenery lovely and sublime - the action and humor subtle and flowing.  It does tend to drag slightly during the underwater sequences - and Moore, like every other actor who's played Bond, is somewhat of a laugh in a wetsuit.  But I must say, the rock-climbing scene towards the end is exhilarating.
The cast here contains most of the usual personages for a Bond film: Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), ""Q"" (Desmond Llewelyn), a ditzy blonde -herein named Bibi Dahl (Lynn-Holly Johnson), and Walter Gotell appears again as General Anatol Gogol. For the first and only time, the character of ""M"" is absent, as Bernard Lee (who was ""M"" in each of the previous 11 007 films) passed away while preparing for this role.  Bill Conti's musical score is pleasant, but one still cannot help missing John Barry's lush, colorful touch.  The cool Bond car of this movie, a Lotus Esprit, makes only a brief appearance - security-protected, it lamentably gets blown up when someone tries to break in.  To compensate, this leads to a fun action set piece, wherein Melina & Bond must make a daring escape in a banana-yellow Citroen 2CV- ""I'm afraid we're being out-horse powered.""
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is the first Bond film to take its title from one of Ian Fleming's short stories rather than his novels.  Yet, unlike the book, which is set in the Caribbean, this film is set in the richly scenic surroundings of the Mediterranean Sea.  Like all of the other Bond films, this movie doesn't solely follow or specifically stick to the Fleming story on which it's based.  There are changes and additions, as well as scenes and sub-plots taken from no less than two of his other novels.  Yet the end result is an immensely enjoyable and satisfying adventure, indeed, one of the very best installments in the series!",1063670400,,5087,4.942488262910798

It's very serious in tone, with the focus on the characters and the plot, not on comic book figures (Jaws) or ditzy bimbos (Goodnight) or special effects.  Most of the Moore films of the 1970s incorporated more lightheartness and humor than the classic Bond films of the 1960s.  But I've felt that Moore shouldn't get ALL the blame for this, as Connery's 'Diamonds Are Forever' from 1971 follows the 'Moore' formula as well, so it's obvious that the producers were going in that direction anyway, after the unfortunate lackluster reaction to the excellent, but serious, 1969 movie 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.  Anyway, after the huge special effects spectacle that was 'Moonraker', the turn of a new decade allowed the producers to rethink the franchise and get back to the bare basics.  'FYEO' is a noble effort and recalls the earlier tone of 'From Russia With Love'.
By far, the worst part about this film is the horrible disco-inspired musical score of Bill Conti - maybe the worst of the franchise.  It dates the movie considerably and feels completely out of place in many scenes.  I've always been a huge fan of the Bond musical scores, which means I've always been a fan on John Barry.

I rank it in the top 3 of the entire Bond series(along with From Russia With Love and Goldfinger). Moore plays the role not only with his usual humor but in this particular movie he seems to have a dark side to him in a few scenes (not seen since Connery). The story is very believable, the characters are very believable. After Moonraker the Producers went back to more of a film that was not reliant on special effects, It was a very good move, I think that with Moore's acting and the less reliance on the gadgets make this particular film very memorable. Only nitpick I have with it are the prime minister and his side-kick who take the place of M. After this film there was a 6 year wait for another good Bond Film (Living Daylights). Octopussy was decent but should have been Moore's last effort and A View to a Kill was just god awful (Not Moore's fault though). This film should be considered the definer of Moore's legacy, not either of the last two which is what so-called critics have a great tendency to do.

He has stolen the ATAC system and with it, has a serious advantage in destroying any submarine! The new Bond girl is Melina Havelock. She is avenging the death of her parents at the hand of a hitman, Gonzalez hired by Kristatos. The music is fantastic in this film!!! Sheena Easton sings a melody that you just can't get out of your head! The only downpoint in this film is the missing appearance of ""M"" and the ridiculous dialogue between Blofeld and 007.

2 - My favorite theme song: The title track For Yours Eyes Only by Sheena Easton.
3 - My favorite chase sequences: Helicopter peril, countryside mountains, snow chasing....
4 - The best of all the stories - I actually believed this relationship that bond inspires.
In effect, this film and based on the stories of the original Ian Flemming novels, is the truest in its content and reliability for true ""Secret Service"" action. Roger Moore will always be the bond for me - playing closest to the novels in the sense the one eleiment that Roger brings to the character - is humor. The character is charming and has a great sense of humor if you read the books.
Roger Moore gives his best performance along with Topal, this movies has energy and a lot of speed, drama and fun. The action, the exotic locals and the special effects along with the technology of the time are fantastic. It is actually one of the longer running ones as well. But you really can't tell the passage of time. This is a definite must in the James Bond Series and a must for Roger Moore fans. (8-25-02)",1030233600,3,1264,4.360169491525424

The action and character in this entry are brought down to earth and make this one of the best bond films.

This movie is one of the most unintentionally funny films I have ever seen, which is why I give the DVD 2 stars instead of one, because it did have us all laughing.  Another funny thing is that I remember liking this movie as a child, but watching it now was almost unbearable.  Carole Bouquet's performance did the impossible, as she managed to convince me that she is, and not Denise Richards, the worst acting Bond girl of all-time.  Don't believe it?  Just fastforward about 15 minutes into the movie when a terrible tragic event occurs in her characters life. One which usually involves crying, yelling or at least saying something to express your disbelief.  But Carole just looks straight at the camera with a puzzled look like she just realized that she can't remember where she has placed her keys.  And the editing in this film is horrible.  There is one scene where Roger Moore runs up a mountainous flight of stairs to intercept an escaping car, not once but twice.  When the scene starts, it is the dead of night, but when Moore stops the car after his second attempt, the sun is up and its day time.  Then there is the Magyver scene in the end where Bond fashions his shoe laces into some kind of rope climbing aid that is so out of this world you can't even begin to contemplate what it is the film makers want you to think he has done with the laces.....but the funniest moment of all is seeing Roger Moore in a scuba mask and diving gear.  Holy cow, we paused it on there for about 20 minutes and could not stop laughing.  So, if you want a good laugh from a DVD that is well put together around a film that doesn't deliver the goods, this is the one to watch.",1014768000,7,1805,4.387387387387387
479496,5,630251004X,"This is my favorite Jame Bond movie.  Perhaps its because its a little more down to earth and realistic, or because the story goes back to pick up where OHSS leaves off, or maybe it proves you don't have to be a dumb, busty blonde to win the affections of Mr. Bond.  Although this Bond film doesn't have the largest array of gadgets and gizmos, it's still a nice action/adventure movie with a lot of good wit!  How often do you hear bond tell a villian like Blofeld to keep his hair on?  Did you catch the passcode tune on the keypad in Q's workshop?  Bond completes Toyota's 1980s jingle.  Or how about when Bond and Melina are driving in her dinky, yellow car down the a wooded hillside and Bond expresses his love for driving in the country!  These little things set this film apart from the other bond movies.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and thought Carol Bouquet as Melina was a nice, fresh change from the other bond women.  Her smart, tough-cookie character proved that she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself!  (Who would argue with a woman armed with a crossbow?)
The story itself was interesting, and although the location shoots weren't quite as glamourous as other Bond movies, the scenes from Greece and Italy were a nice backdrop for the story.  Lynn Holly Johnson's BiBi Dahl was a nice touch to the storyline while the ex-pro skater displays some of her art and Topol teaches a good espionage trick with his pistachios (which he's eating almost entirely throughout the movie).
Bottom line, the movie feels like a story and situation that could actually be happening somewhere, right now (back in the 80s) in the ""real world"".  The more current bond films seem a little too futuristic to be believable... not that there's anything wrong with that!

479497,5,630251004X,"This is certainly one of the best Bond films of the Roger Moore era, possibly the entire series. This is a high-class thriller, which returns to the formula which worked best for Bond in the early films.
The plot here is nicely realistic, and the film a taut and believable one. There is some great action, including one of the most famous scenes of any Bond, where he and Melina are keel-hauled through a lagoon of ravenous sharks.
There is some superb acting here, notably from Topol and Julian Glover. Glover is a very good culture villain, who holds much menace. Whereas Topol steals almost every scene in which he appears. he is chariasmatic, intriguing, interesting, and a the rivalry between he and Glover adds spice to the film.
The locations used are, as always, attractive and varied, but in this film they are more refined. Which makes the film work better.
The humour which pretty much epitomised Moore's Bond is mercifully lacking here. There is some, which is good, but thankfully they have kept the needless jokes and puns etc, out. The humour in many of Moore's Bond films is over the top, and works against the film as a whole.
This time round he has a very competent ally and lover in the form of Melina Havelock, who is out to avenge the death of her parents. You get the distinct impression that, if pushed, she could carry out her vendetta on her own, completely without Bond's help. She comes across as very confident, very able, and driven by a desire for revenge.
The score is very good, very catchy, and probably only second to ""A View to A Kill"".
The only downpoint of this film is the confusing pre-title sequence. It has no relevance to the film, the actor who plays the baddie (who is clearly supposed to be Blofeld, although i have no idea why they suddenly decided to sneak him in) cannot deliver the lines menacingly, so the entire scene just falls flat on it's face.
One of the Bond film's major assets is Walter gotel, the actor who plays KGB General Gogol. He has considerable screen prescence, and never fails to bring menace to the film whether he is working with Bond, or against him. He is possibly the best recurring character ever to have featured. It is a great shame that he hasn't been seen since The Living Daylights. And i doubt he'll be back.

Roger Moore continues to be the smoothest James Bond as he searches for his government's stolen ATAC system, which leads him to cross paths with Melina (Carol Bouquet). Bouquet is the perfect Bond girl, as she is beautiful, self reliant, and intelligent. There search for answers leads them to the Alps and then to Greece, where a few of the series best action scenes are produced.
Overall, I can't recommend this movie enough. Every element in the story works just fine, and the movie never feels too long or too short. As for the DVD, it's got a sharp picture, decent sound and some really interesting extra features.

Some of the comic elements Moore loved to add are still here, but he shows a few more serious moments that remind us that Bond kills people for a living.
Another aspect I like is the diverse action.  Bond is all over the globe, utilizing many of the skills from his bottomless pit of abilities:  scuba, skiing, driving (even in a grade-A lemon), and mountain climbing.  All handled with equal ability.
The Moore era Bond has given us the best of the skiing sequences so far (with the exception of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, my personal favorite).  Next to the Moore skiing stunts, the ski episode in The World Is Not Enough was outright lame!  I was counting my Juju-bees, trying to get rid of all the black ones.

A British submarine code machine is somewhere at the bottom of the Albanian coast, and it's a race between 007 and Soviet-backed agents to find it.  The execution is near-perfect, hints of Bond's tougher days (such as the trip to Tracy's tombstone and Bond tossing his hat in Monepenny's office) let the viewer know that the REAL 007 is back, while traditional Moore elements like the Lotus and the drunk Italian man are blended perfectly.  Everybody, from Carole Bouquet to Julian Glover to the late Cassandra Harris (future Bond Pierce Brosnan's wife) to the terrific Topol pulls their own weight, and then some.

This film returns to the style of Ian Fleming and the style of Bond Connery portrayed in the 60's.  Moore has lost alot of the cheesy humor that was overused in the disastrous Moonraker.  He is much tougher and a little less suave than usual, and this combination makes for a great character.  Moore is supported by a great cast and some excellent locations throughout the movie.
FYEO returns to the fight between the East and the West, this time fighting to recover an advanced computer piece.  Excellent scenes were filmed as Moore fought his way through some excellent ski scenes  as well as some very cool scuba sequences on the ocean floor that eventually lead to an action packed climax on a magnificent mountaintop.

479549,3,630251004X,"""For Your Eyes Only"" should be for anyone's eyes, but doesn't have the staying power of earlier Bond films. This Roger Moore entry into the Bond canon provokes the most disagreement from fans, who consider it possibly Moore's finest outing as Bond, but consider the film to be surprisingly lackluster.
A Cold War espionage tale (a nuclear launch device is being sought by the Russians), is cooked together with elements of ""The Guns of Navarone""(to be supplied by a Greek magnate), is spiced with some exciting but physically impossible stunting (Bond outruns his enemies by making a wreck of the Winter Olympics), sprinkled with a fine powder of amazingly attractive women (what else?), and the viewer is left---not quite satisfied.
Perhaps the main problem is the aging Moore, who, even at his best, could never exhibit the sophisticated dangerousness of Sean Connery. Has anyone ever noticed that only Moore, of all the Bonds, is blond? Unlike his predecessor (and his successors) Moore could never glower threateningly. He needs to do so, badly, in this film, if only to capture the Cold War grittiness of ""From Russia With Love.""
Moore's inability to project deadliness is the curse of his Bond films, but ""For Your Eyes Only"" evens the score by assembling a fine cast, including Topol, as a friendly villain.  Caroline Bouquet plays Melina Havelock, a crossbow-toting beauty with hair a la Crystal Gayle. Lynn-Holly Johnson plays a hyperhormonal teenage figure skater who is probably the only girl whom Bond ever sends home before daybreak...and too bad...and once again, too Roger Moore.",971654400,2,1594,5.10727969348659

It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases proportionally with Roger Moore's age with each new film.
The first two thirds of the film are good. However, the film falls asleep in the third. When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all. Bill Conti's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive. It is in the final third of the film that Conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring which only contributed to the anti climatic finale.

479551,5,630251004X,"""For Your Eyes Only"" is the twelfth entry in the James Bond series and is the fifth outing for Roger Moore as the British superspy. It was decided in this feature to return to a storyline that emphasized Bond's physical and mental prowess and reduced the use of various spy gadgets to a minimum. The premise of the movie is also more realistic than in the past, harking as far back as ""From Russia With Love"".
The story involves the apparently accidental sinking of a British spy ship off the coast of Albania. This in itself might not have been a great concern except the ship carried a communications device called ATAC which can direct British submarine-launched missiles and the man who was leading the ATAC recovery effort is killed by a Spanish hitman. Bond's assignment is a simple one, find out who hired the hitman and why. Bond soon finds out that his mission will be far from simple particularly when murdered man's daughter Melina is seeking to avenge his death and it appears that the Soviets are somehow getting involved. To succeed, Bond must seperate friend from foe and at the same time prevent Melina's vendetta long enough to do so.
The casting for ""For Your Eyes Only"" is excellent all the way around with French actor Carole Bouquet playing Melina, famed British actor Julian Glover playing the sauve Kristatos and Topol of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" fame playing the Greek smuggler Columbo. Most of the series regulars such as Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn returned but unfortunately, actor Bernard Lee passed away before production began and as a tribute to him, his character ""M"" was not recast, the only time in the series ""M"" has not appeared on-screen. As a side note, an actor with a brief role in this movie was Cassandra Harris, who happened to be the wife of the man who would eventually assume the mantle of James Bond, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan.
The script of ""For Your Eyes Only"" would for the first time since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" feature a Bond denuded of his gadgets. This point is emphasized by the loss of his trademark Lotus early in the film and his reliance of his own abilities to get him through the tight spots. This allowed Roger Moore, for once, shed his ""wooden Bond"" persona, and he gave his best acting performance out of all his Bond outings. Here, Bond fans get to see a wider range of emotions from their hero, particularly the cold-bloodedness of Bond when he has a killer of one of his colleagues at his mercy.
The tone of this story is not entirely serious. The car and ski chase scenes are not only performed in their usual, entertaining manner but are also done with a firm tongue-in-cheek. The opening sequence of the movie is also amusing, featuring Bond's old foe Blofeld for a brief uncredited cameo. The scenes featuring Bond and the over-eager ice skater Bibi Dahl (played by Lynn-Holly Johnson) are priceless, perhaps the only time we see an embarassed and uncomfortable James Bond on-screen.
There is plenty of drama though, include several excellent underwater confrontations and perhaps one of the most diabolical methods of killing Bond yet devised, originally written by Ian Fleming in his novel ""Live and Let Die"", where he and Melina are to be used by the villian as bait while trolling for sharks. The tension-filled scenes of Bond scaling a mountain face are also quite excellent.
Of the different video versions of the film this reviewer has seen, the special-edition DVD by MGM is by far the best. Not only is the print and soundtrack of excellent quality, the DVD is two commentary audio tracks and lots of documentary material. This DVD is a must-have for any James Bond fan or for that matter, any fan of the spy film genre.

Lynn-Holly Johnson IS a little annoying as a  spoiled young olympic hopeful, but the character is SUPPOSED to be  annoying, so she actually was a bit of inspired casting.  The story brings  Bond back to the style of the films of the 60's, as Bond once again squares  off with the Soviets in a race to recover a sensitive piece of computer  equipment.

But over the years the  Bond organization has been trying to somewhat repair the damage done to the  series by the entire dung heap of Roger Moore Bond movies by saying that  FYEO was an ""attempt to return to the suspense and believability of  the early films"". Nothing could be further from the truth. You want  evidence? Observe: Not only the most horrifyingly inane opening sequence in  the Bond bunch (""Mr. Bond, please!

479649,4,630251004X,"Well, after the quite fantastical ""Moonraker"", our hero 007 abandons his space shuttle and plants his feet firmly on the ground for this one. I initially found FYEO quite disappointing considering it came  after the two most solidly earth-shattering entries in the series. Just  compare FYEO with Moonraker and you'll see what I mean. But after seeing it  a few more times I came to appreciate its considerable values. Instead of  the usual world domination plan by an evil megalomaniac, the plot centres  on the race to obtain the ATAC, a top-secret piece of military hardware  that is lost when the Navy vessel St. Georges is sunk in mysterious  consequences. After being assigned to recover it, Bond runs into Melina  Havelock (played by the stunning Carole Bouquet) who is planning revenge  for the murder of her parents. Bond gets caught up in a feud between two  Greek smugglers, Milos Columbo (Topol) and Aris Kristatos (Julian Glover).  007 discovers that Kristatos is in league with the KGB, and is planning to  hand the ATAC over to them. Sounds mundane at first glance but when you  consider that the ATAC is capable of launching Polaris missiles to destroy  major cities, the plot becomes far more sinister.
FYEO features some  impressive stunt work, such as in the car- and ski chases. There is also  one cliffhanger of a scene where Bond is climbing up a huge precipice  towards the enemy hideout, however one of Kristatos' henchmen is slowly  knocking out his rope guides.... But what really stands out is the cast.  Roger Moore delivers a very effective performance in his fifth appearance  as Agent 007, notwithstanding the fact he's old enough to be Melina's dad.  It's funny, that Moore seems to fluctuate from looking ancient in one scene  to looking quite young in another, something I've always noticed in his  later films. Carole Bouquet provides a very effective leading Bond girl  (partially because she's SO amazing to look at), while Topol and Julian  Glover are sublime as ally and villain of Bond respectively.
There is no  lack of action, as always: a highly amusing car chase in which Bond and  Melina flee Kristatos' henchman in a Citroen 2-CV (what next?) and a very  effective ski-chase later on with Bond on skis and his pursuers on  motorbikes (unfair advantage? I think not). About flaws: a rather  outrageous soundtrack, the annoying presence of Lynn-Holly Johnson as  teenage ice-skater Bibi Dahl, and the finale is rather underwhelming. Plus,  ""M"" veteran Bernard Lee is missing: he passed away during the  lead up to production. A sad loss.
All-in-all ""For Your Eyes  Only"" is a solid spy thriller in its own right, and those fans of Ian  Fleming whose Bond has been missing from the screen for some time should be  well satisfied.",948585600,2,2772,4.886021505376344
479650,4,630251004X,"I certainly agree with most everyone else ready to remind us that ""nobody does it better"" as James Bond than Sean Connery !  Connery created this role; he is undeniably a good actor outside the James Bond perimeter, and,  unlike many of his peers, he is ever watchable !
But we should give Roger  Moore credit for what he has accomplished.  Unlike Connery, Lazenby,  Dalton, or Brosnan, Moore's Bond is really English:  the look, the accent,  the demeanor, the punch lines.  If you have reservations and really want  to see Roger Moore at his best, watch ""The Saint"" - the British TV series  of the 60's most of which are adaptations of Leslie Charteries short  stories.  ""The Saint"" follows ""Maverick"" (where Roger Moore plays his  part), and ran almost simultaneously with the other delectable British TV  series, ""The Avengers"", featuring Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, and Linda  Thorson.  Moore is young, handsome, and, in fact, Simon Templar, the  character he plays there very well anticipates the 007 to come.  It is  James Bond without Q's help, and, perhaps less flamboyant !  The first 8  episodes have been recently re-released on VHS.  Try ""The Russian  Prisoner"" and ""The Queen's Ransom"".
The 1981 ""For Your  Eyes Only"", is, probably, the best Bond Moore did.  Good plot (and more  complex) story, good acting and character development, good humor, lots of  effective villains (compare this with the 1997 Pierce Brosnan's ""Tomorrow  Never Dies), plus one (played by Topol) who helps the good guys. solid  spy-adventure, non-stop action, and Sheena Easton's great title song (1981  Academy Awards Nomination) !  This is a rare instance when 007 shows  concern and protects ""his girls"" instead of (typically and easily) getting  them.  Carol Bouquet (as Melina Havelock), Cassandra Harris - Brosnan's  wife (as Countess Lisle), and Lynn-Holly Johnson (as Bibi) play well their  parts.
(4 stars only to allow 5 for ""From Russia with Love"",  which I believe to be the best Bond movie, and, also, the one Sean Connery  enjoyed the most doing).

479651,5,630251004X,"The new range of special edition DVD versions of the Bond films are being released in groups from 1999-2002, and fortunately this fine effort was in  the first batch.  Others have remarked on what most fans regard as the very  best of the Moore Bonds, and I won't dispute them here.  From it's nifty  nod to the George Lazenby performance in ""On Her Majesty's Secret  Service"" to the fine ensemble acting, to the sheer style of the  non-traditional ending, FYEO succeeds because it marks one of the few times  the producers took special pains to incorporate Fleming into the script.  For that effort, a full five stars are well-deserved.
Where this product  fails, however, is in living up to the standards this Special Edition  series has set for itself.  Like other entrants in this series, FYEO has  audio commentaries by the filmmakers.  As with all the Special Editions,  the Ian Fleming Society, perhaps the most 'serious' of the Bond Fan Clubs,  provides a narrator who ties together the sometimes meandering  recollections of various memebers of the cast and crew.  Unfortunately on  this outing, the narrator's voice is heard far more than the filmmakers',  and what the narrator has to say is often inane.
For instance,  something on the order of five minutes is given to a painfully detailed  discussion of the Citroen car used in the chase scene, and its place in  20th century Europe.  Interesting stuff for trivia buffs, but it hardly  lends useful, direct information about the film itself.
Frequently,  too, the narrator seems eager to do rather arbitrary comparisons between  this Bond and another.  It's interesting, in its way, but it prevents us  from hearing primary source information from the filmmakers.
Worse,  there are very few times where the audio commentary actually speaks about  the action on the screen.  Oh, to be sure, you find out how certain stunts  were effected, but whole scenes go by without comment on either track.
This goes in stark contrast to the much superior ""Thunderball  SE"", wherein the extra material truly amplifies your enjoyment of the  film.
Having said all this, of course, I would still recommend that you  buy this version of the film over any other.  It does uncover some of the  mysteries of the production.  But it's probably not where you want to start  if you're a student of the filmmaking process.  Far better in this series  for its depth of commentary is ""Thunderball"" or even  ""License to Kill""--even though both are actually less enjoyable  films than FYEO.",946944000,17,2527,4.914285714285715

Never for  one moment does any aspect of the movie falter (there is one tiny scene but  that's at the very end.)  Moore is simply perfect as Bond.  Julian Glover  is ideal for Kristatos.  And, to be simple, there's not one actor in this  movie who didn't pull his or her weight.

The best part is the  music.  Athlough a few elements are based on disco, the scenes actually  BENEFITTED from it.  It's wonderfully done and I wis hthe soundtrack  existed.  The music throughout the movie is perfect and suits each scene  admirably.
The only scene which fails to grab is at the very end where  Bond (who places his walkie-talkie watch on a macaw's perch) goes off and  allows the macaw to talk to... the Prime Minister of England Margaret  Thatcher.  However, this scene is incredibly small in length, and given the  fact this movie lacked most of the Moore silliness I can accept  it.

479716,4,630251004X,"Although MOONRAKER (1979) made a heap of money, the filmmakers of the James Bond film franchise wisely decided to bring our hero back to Earth this time.  It is surprising, though, that with all the commentary lauding  the return to Fleming, that the films directly after this one slowly but  surely drift away from Fleming yet again.  This could have been Roger  Moore's fnest Bond if not for the fatal flaw of the music.  I like some of  the score - the music during the pre-credits sequence meshes nicely with  the action.  But that discordant piano and rachets for the beginning of the  ski chase?  Bland TV-type music at best.  Thank God it is absent from the  soundtrack album.  Director John Glen's editing expertise stands him in  good stead in setting the pace, but no Bond film should be over two hours  long.  It must be Moore's languid delivery which adds to the length.  In  some scenes Moore looks old and in others he looks great, and all the  establishing shots expertly edited in with the stuntmen adds a great deal.  There is a freshness to FOR YOUR EYES ONLY that is important in setting the  tone for the Bond films of the 80s.  And I'm glad to see the special  edition does not shy away from references to Blofeld nor the non-Eon  production NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.",940723200,,1285,4.530701754385965

7827342,3,630251004X,"This movie starts out somberly with Bond laying red roses at his late wife's grave. It seemed hurriedly done like it might as well have been omitted or been a box to check for background information. Straightaway, he quickly delves into the the next mission seconds after laying the roses. We don't see his face but his back when he places them,  very little emotion is detectable in this obligatory ritual. Personally,  I notice in later 007's some emotions are permitted.

In ""For Your Eyes Only""  Bond is an able 007, but he's older and more distinguished at this point in the series.  The love interest in this seems much younger than he in contrast to his age, and the chemistry- to this particular couple- tad formulaic.

The film began seriously and ends on a silly note as is the customary formula in the early Bond films. The silly finale here is 007 talking with ""PM Thatcher"" on the red telephone while having a rendezvous with the love interest. The jaunty ending was not to Sir Moore's taste, as I understand it. He felt the ending was too silly.  I agree this movie could not settle on seriousness or frivolousness so both suffered for inscrutable reasons.  The mixture of both light and heavy did not capture my fancy in this,  and the soundtrack is not as good as some Bond movies. Thank you.",1511568000,,1308,4.579399141630901
