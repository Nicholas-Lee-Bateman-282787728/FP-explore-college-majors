4006937,5,B002WIDRKS,This is a must for all the ones who grew up watching G. I. Joe!,1275436800,5,63,3.2666666666666666
4006938,5,B002WIDRKS,"I remember this show when I was a kid growing up and have been waiting for years to be able to collect it on DVD.  At last someone had the good sense to put it on DVD.  The picture quality and sound are very good considering how old the material is.  Now you can enjoy the struggles of the Joes against Cobra and watch Cobra Commander and his cohorts bicker and squabble to your hearts contentment.  This is a collection that no kid who grew up in the 1980s should be without.  This series is right up there with He-Man, Transformers, and others that made the 1980s a great time for cartoons.",1270252800,3,592,4.25
4006939,4,B002WIDRKS,I am so excited that GI Joe is on DVD & have added it to the list of DVDs I have purchased of cartoons from my childhood!  The 1980s was the best decade to be a kid in!,1269043200,12,168,3.4210526315789473
4006940,5,B002WIDRKS,"If you like the old cartoons like thundercats and transformers, then you'll love G.I. Joe. It's easier to appreciate how awesome the cartoon is when you watch it as an adult because a lot of the ridiculousness that escaped you as a child is very obvious now. I would recommend this show to anyone and the dvd copies are great as far as audio and video. G.I. Joe is a true classic that will probably be enjoyed forever. It is certainly better than any cartoons that currently air and fits the old saying of 'they just don't make them like they used to'.",1267056000,12,552,4.368932038834951

4006980,2,B002WIDRKS,"Purchased all 4 DVD box sets (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0) and they all worked except 1.3.  Had a strange coating on discs making them unplayable. Sent 1.3 discs back for refund and bought it again, this time from another vendor but still within Amazon.com. These also had the same problem suggesting a manufacturer defect. Will send them back again. Attempts to clean them with safe microfiber clothe only spread the coating and didn't work. There are no scratches just the odd coat of something.  I contacted Shout Factory and waiting to hear back. If it worked I'd rate it 5 stars but it didn't. This rating is about the quality of the discs not the actual cartoons.  Curious if others had same issue with season 1.3?",1426377600,7,715,4.6141732283464565
4006981,5,B002WIDRKS,Thanks awesome,1422921600,,14,6.5
4006982,1,B002WIDRKS,"This rating is for the DVD set, not the series.  The series is one of the best Sunbow cartoons from the 1980s, and in my humble opinion, this volume of Season 1 has almost all the best episodes of the series, including ""There's No Place Like Spring Field,"" ""Worlds Without End,"" ""The Traitor,"" Eau De Cobra,"" ""The Pit of Vipers,"" and ""The Wrong Stuff.""

I ordered the individual volumes instead of the box set because I read all the customer reviews on the box sets that mentioned a glue-like substance on the DVDs.  After I ordered and received all the individual volumes, I found that the glue-like substance was on every single DVD within this particular volume, as well as the Season 2 set.  It wasn't just a spot here and there--there was a thick, circular layer on all the DVDs in both volumes!  I used undiluted rubbing alcohol to try and remove the substance, and I was able to remove most of it, and this process caused me to scratch all the DVDs.  I shouldn't have to clean brand-new DVD's that I just purchased!!  Since I ended up having to deal with this problem anyway, I wish now I had just ordered the box set and saved money!  What a rip off!  Thank you, good folks at the Shout! Factory, for this fine swindle!!!  JERKS!!!",1417305600,5,1239,4.442477876106195

4006997,5,B002WIDRKS,I am so happy to get this season to add to my collection. G.I.Joe was the best cartoon of the 80's.,1393459200,,99,3.761904761904762
4006998,5,B002WIDRKS,"I remember the heady days of watching cartoons on Saturday morning, wake up having no school, and breakfast at a moments notice. GI Joe was a show that I watched and thoroughly enjoyed. It helped that I collected them as well. Obviously the effects and the dialogue are a bit cheesy, but the nastolgia alone is worth watching them over and over.",1393459200,3,345,4.580645161290323
4006999,5,B002WIDRKS,I love this cartoon! It's amazing to revive my childhood watching this. The complete season 1 and 2 are great.,1390435200,,110,4.55
4007000,5,B002WIDRKS,"As a kid growing in the 80's, G.I Joe was a big part of my childhood, the toy line and the cartoon series were exceptional. I remember watching the cartoon every Saturday morning, those were the days before the ""Wii"" or the ""Playstations"" that takes off a lot of the kid's imagination nowadays. Is kind of weird to watch them again and realize they look a little silly now but to me is a way to keep a part of my beloved childhood memories alive.",1381276800,4,446,4.258823529411765
