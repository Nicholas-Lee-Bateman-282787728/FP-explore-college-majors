6145497,4,B00H9LHVHI,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS...

I didn't run to the theater to catch this movie, despite the mountain of marketing that preceded the opening.  Sure, Labor Day has a great pedigree, with actors Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin, plus director Jason Reitman, the new Hollywood wunderkind who gave us Juno and Up in the Air.  But the schmaltzy ad campaign gave Labor Day all of the appeal of a typical bodice ripper paperback, a Harlequin Romance up on the big screen, and it just seemed a little, well, desperate, with the lead actors solemnly giving all of reasons that I should hurry and see their movie.  Hurry and see it before all of the reviews come out, it read in captions only I could see.

But I wasn't a football fan, so on Superbowl Sunday I took my Mom along, and since there was nothing remotely appropriate for a 78 year old women (her, not me) I bought tickets at a virtually empty multi-plex, and settled down for what I hoped was a tolerable few hours.

Labor Day begins when Adele (the always captivating Kate Winslet) shows us with just a few gestures that she is not a happy woman, afraid to drive her car out of the driveway with her 13 year old son in tow to make her monthly trip to the local market.  Tobey Maguire, who should put ""professional voice-over artist"" on his resume, provides the grown-up narrative voice of son Henry, played as a boy by (him of the very cool name) Gattlin Griffith, who confirms Adele's on-going depression, along with the information that she had been left by her husband, his father, and had grown steadily sadder since.  Henry gives up a much sunnier life with his father and new wife and kids to become his mother's keeper, watching her constantly, helping, correcting and gently guiding his trembling and troubled mom through life.

When their marketing trip is disturbed by a menacing, bleeding man in the store (Josh Brolin), the two find themselves kidnapped at knifepoint by him.  The man forces Adele to take him to her home, so that he can ""lay low"" until night, after which he will leave them as he found them.  Adele and Henry are suitably frightened and upset, especially when the man, Frank Chambers, ties Adele to a chair, with the ""I'm a nice guy caveat"" that she will now be able to honestly tell police she had been kidnapped (as if she would do anything else after a kidnapping). We learn from a variety of sources, television, neighbours, cops, that Frank is an escaped convict, a murderer no less.  The information doesn't make Adele and Henry relax much, but true love, with a generous slathering of sexy romance thrown in, can make bedfellows of the strangest people.

And so Frank begins to charm the pair, with chili making, handyman duties and fatherly hair mussing and baseball advise given to Henry, as starved for this kind of affection as his mother is starved for love. The now almost famous peach pie making scene is so sexual it verges on incestuous. Enough said.  The movie is now set up, with Frank, the escaped prisoner who murdered his wife (even though we learn through the muddled flashbacks that she pretty much deserved it), appearing just in time to save Adele from her loveless and lonely state and provide Henry with the kind of father figure a boy needs.  Over a long weekend, the sad  pair become a hopeful trio, eventually determined to make a run for it together to Canada to begin a new life.  The police and neighbors ominously turn up once in awhile, adding tension and excitement...Will they be caught, or will they make it, as they so obviously deserve to do?

Jason Reitman has been accused by practically everyone of copying Nicholas Sparks with this adaptation of Joyce Maynards novel, from the wistful but worthy characters to the hopeless (but oh-so-sentimental) story.  I'm going to go out on a limb and disagree.  Despite the sappy story, I thought Labor Day was very good, much better than the afore mentioned Sparks films.  The acting of the three main characters (Winslet, Brolin and Griffith) is terrific, Winslet leading the pack with her damaged but deserving-of-love characterization of Adele. While the plot is a little, well, silly (Stockholm Syndrome, anyone?) I found myself completely invested as I watched Labor Day, close to (but not quite at) the edge of my seat, really, really hoping that the new family would make it, despite snooping policemen and nosy neighbors.  Spoiler alert (don't read if you don't want to know how it all turns out).  The ending seemed a bit tacked on, as if a test audience had given the original (not very happy) ending a thumbs down and the studio had insisted on a lighter, happier and definitely more satisfying finale.  But satisfying it is, and who can argue with that?

I gave Labor Day four stars, but I admit that I wobbled between three and four stars when I wrote this review.  The four stars are there because, despite all of the nasty and negative Labor Day reviews floating around cyberspace, I very much liked this movie.  It was engaging, suspenseful and, I thought, hopeful.  A love story that, for me at least, touched my heart and my mind.  So, four stars. No wait...three. Oh what the heck, I really liked it.  Four stars.

By the way, my Mother hated it.",1391385600,104,5229,4.663398692810458
6145498,5,B00H9LHVHI,"I was apprehensive attending the Saturday morning showing of Jason Reitman's Labor Day. Although I almost always avoid reviews and trailers when I am certain I will see a movie, I had heard the mostly negative buzz for Reitman's fifth movie. I also knew that this wouldn't contain the humor that I loved in Thank You for Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air and Young Adult. In short, I was afraid that Reitman's perfect record would be broken, but in my mind at least, he's still batting a thousand. If you're a Reitman fan, I urge you to stop reading until you have seen the movie. It's impossible to talk about it without giving away significant plot points.

For those of you who are undecided, I'm not going to mention anything that isn't revealed in the trailer.

Adele (Kate Winslet) plays a single mother who lives with her son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Her former husband had a child with another woman and Adele struggles to cope with depression and social anxiety. She barely leaves the house, shopping just once a month for supplies from the local store. It might be difficult to understand this condition if you have never suffered from it. Some days are good, and it's possible to talk to a total stranger; other days are difficult, and the slightest trigger can result in a surge of panic. This fight or flight feeling can be overwhelming, and, as a coping technique, those who suffer from anxiety run through every possible scenario before facing the world.

You can imagine Adele's horror when Henry introduces her to Frank (Josh Brolin), who just met him in the store and asked for a ride. I can imagine Adele wondering how to extract herself from the situation without upsetting her son. Does Frank look safe, or could he turn out to be dangerous? Frank more or less insists that Adele help him, and then demands to be driven to her home. He's an escaped convict.

This is not the Reitman that we have come to know and love. Make no mistake, Labor Day is a drama. It plays out somewhat like a Hitchcock movie, but instead of seeing things from the viewpoint of the man on the run, we see things through the eyes of Adele and Henry. Frank just wants to rest for a while and says that he will leave that night by train, but Labor Day weekend is approaching and the trains aren't running.

The story is set in 1987, and the narration is handled by Tobey Maguire, who also shows up later in the story as an adult version of Henry. If you're planning to see this movie because Maguire is involved, his role is fairly minor. This is all about the interaction between Adele and Frank, and how it impacts Henry. The acting is superb, and Winslet thoroughly deserved her Golden Globe nomination.

As the trailer shows, this film isn't a traditional crime drama. Adele has missed her husband and Frank doesn't seem all that threatening. The news bulletins say that he is a murderer serving 18 years, but he insists that things didn't happen the way they were described on TV. We eventually learn the truth through flashbacks, but I won't talk about that here. We are also shown more of Adele's past, and come to understand some of the things that trigger her anxiety. These troubled people find that they like each other, and both Adele and Henry seem content to have Frank around. Instead of treating them as prisoners, he even fixes things around the house.

I found myself actually rooting for Frank to escape and it reminded me of Roger Ebert's comments about the scene in Psycho where we wanted the car to sink into the water when Norman Bates was hiding it. I keep mentioning Hitchcock because tension and suspense is present throughout the film. I think I was engrossed in the story for every single moment of the 111 minutes.

So why are the reviews so negative? Is the story unrealistic? Not to me. Is the ending contrived or weak? I certainly didn't think so. I was never bored and the resolution wasn't immediately obvious. The actors didn't put a foot wrong either. Were people disappointed by the lack of Reitman's established formula? I really don't know why the reviews are so bad. I can assure you that I would echo those opinions if the same were true for me, but I loved Labor Day. The score was subtle and effective, the pacing good, and the atmosphere just right.

The only difficult thing is deciding whether to give the film 4.5 or 5 stars, and I think it deserves a 5. If you like Reitman at all, please give this a chance and make up your own mind. I'm delighted that I did.",1391299200,65,4500,4.538840937114673
6145499,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Directed by Jason Reitman (Up in the Air, Juno) and based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Maynard, Labor Day stars Kate Winslet as Adele Wheeler  a divorced mother of one that suffers from depression.  One day, while clothes shopping with her 13-year-old-son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith), she is approached by a stranger, Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin), who forces her to take him to their home.  Initially appearing to be threatening, Frank managers to ease Adele and Henrys fear  even despite the fact that he reveals that hes an escaped convict and on the run.

Frank is wanted for murder, but he claims hes never intentionally hurt anyone and just needs a place to hide out over the Labor Day weekend until he can catch a train out of town.  In return for their silence, Frank graciously volunteers his help by making home repairs, cooking, etc.  Adele and Henry quickly take to Frank, not having a man around the house  at least since Adeles husband, Gerald (Clark Gregg), left and remarried.

As the story progresses, flashbacks ensue reliving the events leading up to the death that eventually landed Frank in jail.  Even despite his past, Adele doesnt ask questions and quickly falls for him.  However, with neighbors randomly stopping by to check up on Adele and police constantly patrolling the area, its not visible for them to remain in Adeles house.  They devise a plan to make a run for it and head to Canada  but they must attempt to do so without bringing attention to themselves.

Labor Day is really a three-person story all rolled into one, the first of which belongs to the character portrayed by Kate Winslet.  Its becoming harder and harder to find adjectives to describe the flawless acting ability that she possesses.  In all honesty, a movie can be just dreadful, but at least if Kates in the film, you are guaranteed to have at least one character that will not disappoint you.  And, her portrayal of Adele Wheeler is no exception.  Portraying a depressed mother thats suffered through the hardship of a failed marriage while trying to raise her only son has never looked as good.  Her characters emotional state in this film says it all, conveying heartbreak, compassion, and unconditional love.  If for no other reason, you should watch this film for the sheer excellence of Kate Winslet.

While Winslet shines ever so brightly through the entirety of this film, so does her co-star, Josh Brolin.  In my opinion, Brolin is one of the most under appreciated actors in Hollywood.  Sure, his resume is full of relatively obscure roles, such as his portrayal of George W. Bush in W. or Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men, but his stock as a leading man is continuously on the rise  even more so after his role as Frank Chambers.  The prominence of his character is evident in the duel storylines about Frank, one young and one in the present storyline.  Brolin portrays an appreciative authority character that knows the value of freedom and utter importance of family.  His on-screen chemistry with Winslet is blatantly obvious and is one of the reasons this film will put a strangle hold on your attention for its duration.

Lastly, Labor Day is also a coming-of-age story for Adeles son, Henry.  The film begins with voiceover work from Toby Maguire who briefly portrays Henry in the films final moments.  But, for the majority of the film, Gattlin Griffith carries the character on his shoulders.  Henry is an impressionable character, reminiscent of Duncan (Liam James) in another recent growing up film, The Way Way Back.  And, while Griffith does an admirable job of holding his own in scenes with Winslet and Brolin, he shines the most during interactions with his rather ambitious, charismatic girlfriend,  portrayed by Brighid Fleming.  The films lighthearted, humorous moments also unexpectedly come from the two young actors.

Obviously, the acting is outstanding in this film, yet the most annoying part of watching this movie is the fact that its another prime example of having too much of its plot given away by the two-minute movie trailer.  In the event that youve the trailer, then you can probably image the direction in which this works towards.  Regardless, the only drawback of the film is the slightly clunky plot progression.  In one particular scene, now acting as a family, Frank, Adele, and Henry are all in the kitchen making a pie together.  Thats right, for about five minutes, you watch three people make a pie.  No joke  it will feel like you're watching the Food Network.  However, the good news is this scene becomes a massively important plot point. And, if you still don't care for this flick by the time the credits roll, youll at least understand what kind of work goes into making a pie.

Overall, Labor Day is enjoyable mostly because of the tremendous acting performances from both Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin.  Unfortunately it does have its slow moments, though.  About half way through this movie, you will likely be rethinking your choice to watch it  but do yourself a favor and hang in there.  It gets extremely interesting and have you heart pounding a bit right around the midway point.  For me personally, the ending was the selling point.  The conclusion will tie everything together nicely and leave many reaching for a tissue to dry their eyes.  It might be a bit of a spoiler, but for those of you worrying about the possibilities of a melancholy ending, rest assured that won't be the case here.

6145500,4,B00H9LHVHI,"""Labor Day"" (2014 release; 111 min.) brings the story of Adele (played by Kate Winslet), a thirty-something single mother with a son Henry (played by Gattlin Griffith) who is about to start 7th grade and whose voice-over guides the movie. Adele doesn't get out of the house a lot (much later in the movie we learn why in flashbacks) but one day she and Henry go to the local grocery store, and Henry gets cornered by some guy (played by Josh Brolin) who desperately needs a getaway ride. We later learn he is Frank, a convicted murderer who is on the run (much later in the movie we learn about the circumstances of his conviction). Adele and Henry drive him to their house. It isn't long before there is a connection of sorts between Adele and Frank, and Henry dryly observes that, among many different things they did, ""Frank ironed and in return my mom taught him how to rumba"", ha! With the cops still looking for Frank, eventually Frank and Adele must decide whether to make a run for it. To tell you more of the plot would surely spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to experience it for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed and adopted for the screen by Jason Reitman, who previously brought us movies like Juno, Thank You For Smoking, Up In the Air and most recently Young Adult. If you look at that string of films, ""Labor Day"" is quite a departure for him. He probably wanted to stretch his legs, so to speak, and good for him. Second, this is really two movies into one. The first movie, played out in the first hour, focuses on the connection that is building between Adele and Frank (and indirectly with Henry as well), and I have to admit that I wasn't crazy about it, as it plays out pretty much as I would expect a Nicolas Sparks adaptation. Much better is the second half of the movie, where we wonder what is going to happen next as Adele and Frank, and also Henry, make some fateful decisions with long-lasting consequences. I will admit that by the end of the movie, I was tearing up. Third, the performances are quite good, which of course is almost a guarantee from Kate Winslet in any movie. Gattlin Griffith as her son is equally excellent. Check out the short appearance (maybe 5 min. of screen time) of Tobey Maguire at the very end of the movie, as the grown-up Henry. Last, but certainly not least, the movie score, by British composer Rolfe Kent, is nothing short of excellent.

Bottom line: while the first half of the movie was not my cup of tea, the second half of the movie more than makes up for it, and in the end this was quite enjoyable, and better than I had expected. The movie opened today here in Cincinnati and the early evening screening I saw this at was not well attended (less than 10 people in a very large theatre). This doesn't bode well for the movie's box office fortunes. Be that as it may, in the end I enjoyed ""Labor Day"" more than expected, and I might suggest you check this out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1391126400,165,3024,4.417562724014337
6145501,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Have you ever felt manipulated by a screenplay? I have... Writer/director Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), working with Joyce Maynard's novel, really knows how to manipulate us. At the beginning we are hesitant, particularly in the early scenes, which threaten to become mawkish (yeah, the peach pie); but soon, through flashbacks, we come to understand our characters, and the film suddenly becomes unpredictable and involving. Nice switch!

We watch:
  * Kate Winslet (""Contagion"") as Adele, the clinically depressed mother who is forced to shelter an escaped convict in order to protect her son.
  * Josh Brolin (""Gangster Squad"") plays Frank, a felon who escaped from the hospital where he had an emergency appendectomy. He tells her ""things aren't like they seem.""
  * Gattlin Griffith (""Green Lantern"") is Henry, the boy is struggling to help his mother, who is practically agoraphobic. He sorts through bits of information gleaned from her, a classmate, and his father.
  * Maika Monroe (""The Bling Ring"") is Mandy, the classmate, overflowing with youthful theories about life, love, sex and family dynamics.
  * Clark Gregg (""Much Ado About Nothing"") is Gerald, Adele's former husband. He knows he has let his son Henry down and regrets it.
  * James Van Der Beek (Lots of TV) is the ultra-helpful Officer Treadwell. If only he weren't quite so diligent...
  * Tobey Maguire (""The Great Gatsby"") is the adult Henry.

The casting of the younger versions of our main characters is extremely good, with the glaring exception of Toby Maguire as the adult Henry. The first couple of flashbacks confused me; until I realized that we were seeing flashbacks for BOTH of the lead characters.  Duh....

This is PG-13, so expect some mildly sensual situations (no nudity), little or no profanity, the presence of a gun but the only gunshots are off screen and, as I recall, harmless. The screening audience, defying more ""artistic"" critics, applauded this one. Because much of the dialogue is murmured and I didn't see this in a theater with closed captions, I'll appreciate the DVD from Amazon.",1391040000,9,2092,5.067251461988304

6145531,5,B00H9LHVHI,"Review of Labor Day
Hot Toasty Rag, September 2, 2017

Kate Winslet has retreated into seclusion and inner turmoil ever since her divorce from Clark Gregg. She lives with her young son Gattlin Griffith, leaving the house as infrequently as possible and sometimes letting her depression get the better of her, forcing Gattlin to step up and act as the man of the house. On one such excursion to the store on Labor Day weekend, Josh Brolin approaches them. Hes bleeding, limping, in trouble, and asks for a ride. The scared, shy Kate agrees and takes him to her house. They soon find out Josh is an escaped convict, but while he holds them hostage, hes unexpectedly kind and brings life back to the house.

I absolutely love this movie. From the opening scene, director Jason Reitman sets the pace and environment beautifully for the audience. He gives the film a loving touch, and since Kate and Josh both give the best performances of their careers, Im sure Reitman gave his actors fantastic direction. He also wrote the screenplay; Ive read the book, and Reitman greatly improved Joyce Maynards original novel.

To say I don't usually like Kate Winslet would be the understatement of the year. Shes fantastic in Labor Day, as is Josh Brolin. I don't know why they both weren't nominated for Oscars for their thoughtful, multi-layered performances. Hopefully Gattlin Griffith will have a career boost after this film, since its a treasured commodity to find a child star who can actually act. J.K. Simmons, Brooke Smith, Tobey Maguire, and James Van Der Beek have small but memorable roles in the film, more proof that the Jason Reitman gave everyone fantastic direction.

This film has become a staple in my house, one we watch every year in September, and sometimes on Valentines Day as well. Its romantic, poignant, dramatic, suspenseful, and touching. Bring your Kleenexes and get ready for an unforgettable film this Labor Day weekend.",1504310400,,1940,4.905487804878049

A story told from the viewpoint of a young boy, Harry. His dad had left his mom for another woman. His mom, played by Kate Winslet, sounds like she never really recovered from the loss of a newborn girl, and other tragic miscarriages. Then when her husband left, she rarely left her house. Harry took over many chores, but recognized his mom was very lonely. One day a wanted criminal came into their lives, played by Josh Brolin. He fulfilled all the needs of the family, and for a few days there were smiles  and Happiness, and peach pie.

A story long told, and probably should have remained that way.

6145549,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Well, the key ""romantic"" scenes of him behind her guiding her hands with his while they are making a pie, etc., are stolen right out of""Ghost"" and aren't done nearly as well.  I'm sorry but Josh Brolin just isn't sexy and he isn't a romantic lead.  They should never show his whole body from a distance as his legs are too short for his body.  The whole thing is tripe, romantic fantasy.  If you can believe that an escaped convict, a murderer, would spend his time fixing thing in the house and on the car, making pies, cooking dinner, etc., then perhaps you'd be interested in some prime swampland I have for sale. The switching back and forth from the past with her husband to the present with the convict just cause confusion.  And, they never explained the significance of the overflowing bathtub and the water on the ceiling. Winslet plays a zombie really well but it gets old watching her.  And, WHY did they never explain why Frank killed somebody,how he killed, who he killed and why he did it.  Frankly, if I'm going to have a murderer in my house I'd like to know exactly what happened or at least his version of it.  And, how did he get out in time to meet up with her after they tacked on at least 20 more years to his sentence?",1499558400,,1241,4.341991341991342

6145575,4,B00H9LHVHI,"I picked this movie up randomly from the library not really knowing anything about it. It's a very good drama, good acting, interesting story about a mother and a son. It is a bit far-fetched what a nice movie overall. I thought it was well done. The story centers around a mother and a son who encounter a convict who has just escaped from prison and needs a place to hide out. I'd definitely recommend it if you like good dramas or high quality American made pictures. There is a 1955 movie called The Desperate Hours with Humphrey Bogart that is a somewhat similar story line (prison escapees take family hostage in their home)  that  is very good that I'd recommend if you like this movie.",1483920000,,693,4.492063492063492

6145581,1,B00H9LHVHI,"Absolutely ridiculous plot and the movie basically glorifies and romanticizes preying on an emotionally disturbed woman. My wife and I got this DVD because she was curious, and likes Kate Winslet (I don't think she holds as much affection for her anymore), it was like watching a train wreck. It was horrifying, but we couldn't stop watching. I could go on and on, but for one example, this woman actually contemplates fleeing across the border to Canada with an escaped convict who committed manslaughter. Awww how romantic, are you kidding me? What exactly are they supposed to do to live and avoid the law if they even get across the border? And her son who is old enough he ought to know better never thinks to say ""hey mom, that might not be a good idea, maybe we should run away the first chance we get and have a SWAT team swarm the house"". They both had plenty of chances to get away. Her and her nitwit son years later get a letter from the creep ""hey, remember me? I am the guy that held you hostage in your own home that Labor Day weekend years ago threatening your life and that of your son's. I understand this may be a bit awkward and I get it if you don't want to respond, but that was a wonderful weekend, when I get out of prison in a few weeks, is it alright if I drop by your place? I think we had something really special."" and they actually let him into their lives and their family! In what perverse universe does any of this make any sense and how is it romantic exactly? Oh yes, and the pie scene, what.....the....f***. Awww he knows how to make a peach pie and he held her hands tenderly when he did it, and he can fix a few things around the house that needed it, what a swell guy.  I am not sure if the escapee had so much affection for her, even in a perverse way, as he was just manipulating her. Incidentally this is another perfect example of how the Hollywood elite that looks down on us peasants, says one thing and does the opposite, they really do live in a universe of their own. They all say they are against abusing/victimizing women but yet they are very happy to make a movie that glorifies that if they think they might be able to make some money. Kind of like how they make all kinds of movies glorifying violence for its own sake but don't want us little peons owning firearms to defend ourselves (they have bodyguards with them 24/7, what do they care?) I almost never write reviews on books/movies but this is downright trash, offensive and quite possibly could mess with young women's minds into somehow thinking those who abuse them are just lovable ""bad boys"".",1482969600,,2608,4.3552361396303905

6145591,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Labor Day-Drama-111 minutes-Budget $18 million-WW Gross $13 million
 This is an odd little drama, brilliantly directed by Jason Reitman, a director better known for his comedies (Juno, Up in the Air).  From the trailers we rather expect a tense crime drama.  The action revolves around a mom and son with plenty of their own troubles who foolishly pickup a hitchhiker who turns out to be an escaped convict who hides out in their home while holding them prisoner.
 It is actually about loneliness and love and the sometimes bizarre way that families can piece themselves together from scraps.  Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet are the unlikely seekers who find one another.
 This might not be everyones cup of tea but fans of the unusual story with truly first class acting will like it.  Jason Reitman also writes the screenplay.",1474502400,,826,4.899280575539568

Kate Winslet wasn't bad either, but the son was very good and since the story was narrated through him, it turned out to be a pretty good movie.

6146210,2,B00H9LHVHI,"A boring movie with a seriously ridiculous premise: an escaped murderer runs into a woman and her son at a store and forces them to take him to their house, where he ties the woman up, starts making dinner and fixing things around the house for the next few days while he ""recovers.""

The movie spends a lot of time capturing stills of these people - baking cake, cutting fruit, mixing the dough - to be very sensual or something. I don't know. The woman is sad and depressed because, of course she is, and the son is weird and lonely. Somehow the con manages to charm his way into the woman's ""starved-for-help"" pants and convinces her to go with him to Canada so they can live the rest of their lives as fugitives happily ever after.... ?? Yippeee.

This is where i stopped watching this massive dial tone of a movie. I don't know what the people who decided to fund this sedative were thinking, or why so many people give it good reviews. The premise alone is so preposterous as to be off putting. The characters are flat and neither convincing nor likable in this strange twist of The Bridges of Madison County. Their struggles feel more tedious than deserving of invoking empathy of any kind.

The only thing you wish after seeing this movie is that neither you, or anyone you know, will ever have to be in a place in their lives where they are so desperate that they let an escaped convict sweep them off their feet.",1462233600,,1422,4.419847328244275

6146414,3,B00H9LHVHI,"The plot of LABOR DAY is straightforward enough: depressed single mum Adele (Kate Winslet) struggles to look after thirteen-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffith).  Suddenly an escaped prisoner Frank (Josh Brolin) rudely interrupts the rhythm of their lives - although initially frightened of him, both Adele and Henry come to admire Frank as he helps to create a new (and idyllic) family life for them.

The plot is a familiar one, exploited for horrific effect in movies such as THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER (1955), but here used to prompt reflection on precisely what constitutes a so-called ""criminal"" mind.  Director Jason Reitman does a fine job of recreating a hot-house small-town atmosphere in Massachusetts, c. 1987, where all the inhabitants know one another and keep ""dropping in"" at unexpected moments, making the job of concealing Frank from prying eyes that much more difficult.  Despite the location, it's clear that the residents of this town keep themselves to themselves: when neighbor Evelyn (Brooke Smith) comes to visit with her wheelchair-bound son Barry (Micah Fowler), she literally foists Barry on Adele, in spite of Adele's obvious protests.  In this kind of environment, it's hardly surprising that Adele should find Frank so attractive, both physically as well as emotionally.

Reitman contrasts the adolescent Henry's reactions to Frank with flashbacks to Frank's troubled childhood.  We learn how Frank, despite his obvious virtues, never really had a chance in life - as the child of a troubled family with a murderous secret to conceal, he never really knew what stability was like.  Hence his willingness to stay at Adele's, despite the obvious personal risks involved.

Henry has a profoundly ambivalent attitude towards Frank's presence.  While obviously happy for his mother, he feels somehow shut out from this idyllic family life, a fear that is exacerbated after his conversations with fellow-adolescent Eleanor (Brighid Fleming), whose turbulent background has given her a jaundiced view of parenthood.  Henry believes himself to be in love with her (perhaps for the first time), and hence experiences an inner conflict: should he believe Eleanor or trust in his mother?

The film does a grand job of analyzing the complexities of these relationships.  Reitman's camerawork is intense, with tight close-ups alternating with establishing shots focusing on the claustrophobic atmosphere in which the drama takes place.

Given the care and attention paid to setting up the central conflicts, it's a shame that the film's ending has to be so sentimentally tame.  We learn what has happened to Henry in the intervening years since 1987; likewise Frank and Adele.  Everything seems to go favorably for all them - an outcome redolent of  Hollywood at its mushiest rather than a logical consequence of what we have previously seen.  We end up feeling rather disappointed, as if we have been somewhat short-changed by a film with such promising beginnings.",1457740800,,2978,5.286624203821656

6146632,3,B00H9LHVHI,"This movie feels like a bit of a ""Bridges of Madison County"" for modern times. Though families are more complicated in the era when this takes place (which is difficult to discern, based on the touches of rural New England poverty that could trace to the 1970's or 1990's), the love affair depicted on the cover still has elements of the forbidden. The simple story unfolded slowly, relying on each element of suspense to last longer than it really could. The actors, all talented, were each given one or two character ""notes"" to sing, when they are capable of so much more. Though they sang those in perfect pitch, the composition was just not that complex as given to them. I give credit to the film for trying its hand at some tough issues. But overall, this felt like a short story that someone tried to stretch into a novel. Good for a lazy summer day when you feel like sitting still and sipping tea until the final monologue pats you on the head as you drift off to sleep.",1453680000,,979,4.444444444444445

6147411,5,B00H9LHVHI,"It is hard to find fault with this movie.....
I would argue one of the best films I have ever seen and primarily for one reason.
There has been a terrorization of American citizens going on for decades
(especially in recent decades, and especially in urbanized liberal cities and
counties, but at the Federal level also). This phenomenon isn't new. In fact
it's very old. The problem is, it has risen exponentially in the last 3 or 4 decades.

I was a victim of it recently (2011) and it has destroyed my life. This problem is a
corrupt, biased, revenue generating, conflict of interest, self-serving, corporatized
criminal justice system and prison industrial complex. In 2011, I was accused of a
crime I did not commit. I was charged with 2 felonies, and was looking at 15 years in
prison. Though I had called 9/11 to report the incident, I was arrested. Since I knew
I was innocent and had done nothing wrong, and had nothing to hide, I waived my 5th
Amendment rights, and gave a full and truthful statement.

It is my belief and contention that there was not even probable cause to arrest me.
Unbeknownst to me, the arresting officer had twisted my words into complete lies.
He had falsified the police report (a felony crime), so that the district attorney would file
charges. After bailing out of jail, and showing up at my arraignment, the judge did not even
address me, look me in the eye, or allow me to speak, or defend myself. He simply looked
at the police report, looked at a DA statement/complaint, and said ""increase bail to $250,000,
and something else unintelligible. Next thing I know I was taken to jail again for a crime I didn't
commit. After a week, I bailed out again at a cost of $20,000. I was denied a lawyer. I was denied
due process. I was denied a bail [reduction] hearing. I was never allowed to enter a plea or be
referred to the public defenders office.

The DA fabricated/falsified a case/evidence against me. The police officer perjured himself
in court. Another coerced witness perjured themselves in court. I was denied the ability to
subpoena evidence. I was denied assistance of counsel. The lawyer my father finally hired of
his own volition, (far into the criminal court process and even though I financially qualified for a
public defender) turned out to be a scammer/scumbag who did not even cross examine their
witnesses' perjured testimony. I ultimately paid him $10,000. The story is too long to explain
everything, but I will just say that the system is corrupt. It is designed to get people to accept
plea agreements. They don't care if you are innocent or guilty, and you are always guilty until
proven innocent. They never even investigated my case, spoke to me, looked at my evidence,
or offered/asked me to take a polygraph test, before filing charges. I had fought this case to a
trial (pleading not-guilty), but I had pre-existing health conditions, and the case had driven me
down so far health-wise, that I interrupted the trial and accepted the plea deal I had previously
rejected twice. I also began to feel like there was a chance I could actually be convicted, and
die in prison for a crime I didn't commit. That was the other reason I took the plea deal.

I am an honorable man of the highest character and moral integrity. I have lived a life of longsuffering.
My whole life I have helped people, the homeless, and veterans primarily. The only thing I had on my
criminal record at this time, was a shoplifting charge from when I was 17 (almost 30 years ago).
This is just one small facet of how America is being destroyed from within and is turning into a
corporatized fascist police state, where we are giving up more and more of our precious civil rights
and liberties every year.

There are according to some estimates, 300,000 innocent people in prison or jails, every year, and
we have the highest prison population of any nation in the world. Most people are totally ignorant or
oblivious to what is going on, until they or one of their family members becomes a victim. It can literally
happen to anyone. This is one reason why the message in this movie is very important; even though
it doesn't get into politics or these other topics at all. All things said, this is a quality film, very well done,
and quite entertaining. - 4.5 Stars - God Bless America.",1438732800,2,4324,4.632333767926989

6147515,4,B00H9LHVHI,"While caring for my ill father, this movie appeared in my Netflix Streaming ""Recommendations for Susan"" (that's me, Susan). I have always liked Kate Winslet but never gave Josh Brolin much thought (every time I hear his name I think of the Goonies).  Anyway. I was curious to see the dynamics between these two actors seeing as they have completely different acting styles. When I think of Kate, I think Henry James.  To my surprise, I loved the dynamics between the two actors they appeared to have true cinema chemistry.

The story of Labor Day takes place in a small New Hampshire hamlet and is told from the perspective of Kate's son Henry, who is telling the story (via voice over) as a man, reflecting back on 4 specific days from his childhood summer vacation, i.e., Labor Day.  Henry tells the story of how after his father left him and his mother for his secretary, starting a new family, Henry's mother became a recluse, only leaving the house when she had to. As a result,  Henry took on the role of husband, trying to fill the areas of his mother's life that were lacking, minus one area - obviously (intimacy).  Henry understood his mother's loneliness and longing before he even had a name for it.  One line that stands out is, ""I don't think losing my father broke my mother's heart, but rather losing love itself.""  Instead of doing the things that most young pre-teen boys do, Henry stayed devoted to his mother, never really leaving her alone. Henry and his mother Adele were in their own little universe.

The Thursday before Labor Day weekend, Henry and Adele head out to one of the big box stores to buy Henry some pants for school.  It is there they meet Josh Brolin's character Frank, who has escaped from prison, only Adele and Henry do not know this, not right away. Frank is bleeding and need ""assistance"". Frank coerces Henry and Adele to give him a ride.  Adele asks him where would he like to go and Frank says, ""Your house.""  From here the story unfolds and love ensues.  It seems pretty far fetched but that's the imagination of the author. I think in real life, very few women would become intimate with an escaped convict, incarcerated for murder.  I hate to sound snarky but at various points throughout the movie all I kept thinking is: Stockholm Syndrome. Sorry.  But that's how my mind works. I guess I've read too many true crime books.

As the story unfolds it is clear that what you have before you are two people in search of love -- true deep meaningful love after years and years of loneliness and a boy who just wants to be a boy.

If you are a sucker for a love story then this is your movie.
If you've been dumped and feel like you will never find love again, then this is your movie.

I will say this, the movie compelled me enough to buy the book.  I just knew there was information missing in the movie that the book would cover and I was right. It did.

Thanks to this movie, Joyce Maynard has become my new favorite author.",1437523200,7,2974,4.4621072088724585

The only reason for 4 stars vs 5 is that Henry, Adele's son, is so indifferent to the transforming impact Frank made in his life. There seemed to be no loyalty, no credit whatsoever given to the man who validated him as a unique person, spent time on what mattered, and gave purpose to his life.

Kudos to the child actor - Gattlin Griffin who plays an enormously complex role and displays great talent in displaying difficult emotions on his face (fear, anxiety, happiness) very effectively. The movie keeps you guessing till the very end.

6148122,5,B00H9LHVHI,"A prisoner, injured while escaping from prison find refuge in the house of a single mom (Kate Winslet) and her young son during a labor day weekend. No scene is wasted and every single word of a dialogue contributes to advance the story. Through Josh Brolin's character's personal drama, director Jason Reitman wanted to offer us a reflection on justice, redemption and forgiveness; also the role of a male model in the life of a young boy. Kate Winslet's character and her son's seem to embody the fragility and vulnerability of single female families in a world that is becoming less and less safe. But this story is also the one of hope in the face of uncertainty. Beyond being a well acted and well scripted movie, ""Labor Day"" teaches us that Love doesn't always  come beautifully wrapped in a nice gift box in a great location. More often than not, Love will be found in unpredictable ways and in unconventional circumstances. Through ""Labor Day"" the genious of director Jason Reitman  - along with the strong performances of Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet -  had transformed a story with a simple tune into a masterfully perfected symphony.",1431388800,,1144,4.7969543147208125
6148123,5,B00H9LHVHI,"I luckily stumbled onto this film. And wow! A cinematic achievement as Labor Day  occurs rarely. This film demonstrates the craft of film making at its very best. From screenplay, to direction, to the execution of portraying character -- this dramatic movie shows no weaknesses.

Seeing that Kate Winslet starred in the movie caught me eye. As is written about the story that it's a tale about second chances at romance, which intrigued me, for I too wish to have another chance at romance.

How the story was told and acted captivated my attention immediately, and thereafter held me captive throughout the duration of the story.

From its beginning I was drawn in by Kate Winslet's character portrayal --  wondering what is amiss with this woman? She sits in her parked car at a store parking lot. There is a long held moment of hesitation on her part. She stares at the store. Immediately, questions occur about the character's mental and emotional state. Then urged on by her son she gets out of the car, walks toward and into the store.

For a short domesticated moment everything seems banal in the lives of mother and son. While in the store encounter a stranger, a man. He appears, from the backroom, passing through swinging doors enters the character Brolin portrays. This stranger asks the boy: ""Where's your mom?..."" Take me to her."" Meeting her, the stranger asks her and son for their help. She hesitates. From that point tension mounts.

He is physically wounded, bleeding.  On the surface he seems harmless. Yet his bearing projects a sense of urgency. As he talks to the woman a mild roughness accompanies his demanding civility. His gestures, seemingly friendly even loving, are directed exclusively toward the boy. Though seemingly friendly on the surface, his gestures, nonetheless, communicate a looming sense of an imminent threat to the boys safety. His, the boy's, continued safety depends of her acquiesece to this stranger's demands.

By this film, director and screenplay writer Jason Reitmen demonstrates his economical ability to envision and tell a complex story.

Though a drama, never was there a dull moment. Never did any scene lack a distinguishing contribution to an overall  sense of conditions, internal and external, in tension, each resulting from forces acting in opposition to each other.

 A domestic harmony and calm emerges. This emergent tranquility is vulnerable. The resultant insular world has fragility. Proper vigilance must be maintained at all times to avoid the pending forces in opposition. The potentially dismantling forces loom largely. Yet ironically the potent dismantling agent lies within the protagonists-ensemble. Innocent actions of an unwitting, dismantling agent prove to be formidable.

Yet at the very end everything seems to converge suitably.",1431388800,,2813,5.167400881057269

6148324,2,B00H9LHVHI,"The little boy was the best character in this movie. What bothered me most, (besides the 20 minute pie making scene), was this guy was an escaped prisoner, with his face plastered all over the news and people looking for him, yet he goes about the property freely. He fixed a wall, worked on her car right out in the open in her driveway, and had 'family time' in the yard playing baseball. There wasn't any chemistry between the two of them, and if they ever discussed his crime, it was never shown. The story made Kate's character look like she was so desperately lonely she would take any man without question.  You don't find out the 'point of the story' (if there really is one) until the last five minutes.
I've been very disappointed in the movies Kate Winslet acts in, and I'm not sure I will watch another movie with her in it, as her choices of scripts are very poor.",1429920000,,877,4.380368098159509

6148351,5,B00H9LHVHI,"This movie has become one of my favorite movies! I love so many things about it, the script, the lighting and the idea of innocent love throughout. The cast was terrific. Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin sizzled together. Young Henry was so lovable. Every mother wants a son like him. Toby McGuire, even in his brief appearance, and especially through his narrating voice was quite commanding and endearing. My first favorite part of this movie is when they make the peach pie together. My second favorite part is when he's tying them up, Frank says ""I'd take 20 more years just to have another 3 days with you."" Aww...soppy, but so beautiful!",1429660800,,639,4.714285714285714

6148589,3,B00H9LHVHI,I never get tired of a good romance story and this one is simple and passionate.

But it also made me mad.  Was justice done? Is prison ever a place that allows justice? Why do we romanticize waiting for love?  Plus Agoraphobia is a nightmare to live with, and affects all those close to the agoraphobic.  And then I went back to liking it - these two people, this little family, their relationship/friendship/love was healing, supportive, inspirational.  Very love/hate response.

6148682,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Definitely a ""mellerdrama"" with a somewhat unbelievable plot. It was different.

I'm not sure I understand how Frank went to prison for 18 years in the first place. What was shown was ""off-scree,"" but it appeared to have been a tragic accident.  I'm not sure how he got out after only a few years served on the sentence for kidnapping and escape; however, I was happy to see that he did.  I wanted a happy ending.

The effect on the kid's life and on his mother's life was well documented.  Frank was portrayed as competent, knowledgeable and totally likable - plus, let's face it, Brolin is definitely a hunk.  Winslet is lovely, but I've seen her do more believable acting jobs (Sense and Sensibility, for instance).

 I did watch to the end, with some chores to do while I watched, so I must have been interested in what happened to the characters.  I didn't turn it off immediately.",1427760000,,886,4.556962025316456

6148684,4,B00H9LHVHI,Kate Winslet always plays interesting characters. Again in this film. Narration from the son's perspective enhances the film and takes it a cut above romances on Hallmark Channel or LMN. Not as typical a formula plot.,1427760000,,217,5.055555555555555

6148760,5,B00H9LHVHI,"I loved this movie, and especially Kate Winslet in her role as Adele.  She is able to capture an emotion without dialogue and pull at heartstrings in an amazingly realistic manner.  I could feel her anxiety, fear, and cold sweaty shaky hands.  Josh Brolin is excellent and is easygoing as Frank, not pushing too hard or playing a stereotype, but definitely knows how to connect with Adele and seems to understand her pain and confusion.  Young Henry shines as a bright and intuitive lad who loves, protects and encourages his mother.  The narration by Tobey Maguire as the adult Henry adds a lovely layer to this film and really pulled me into all the emotions.
This was quite the unexpected film experience and I will most likely be watching it again.  Amazing!",1427414400,,762,4.734848484848484

An honest and endearing portrayal of an unconventional relationship that is interrupted by social pressures and boundaries.

6148828,4,B00H9LHVHI,"I'll start with, I really enjoy movies with Kate Winslet, I think she is a great actress, underrated.  This was an interesting story of what defines love and how it differs between people.  Without giving it away, some people would consider this unrealistic, or her being a bit crazy, but her choices are based on her prior life experience and how he (Josh Brolin's character) her is all that matters to her.  Different actions make you fall in love, it can be a simple touch or action, and that is very apparent in this movie.  He appeals to what is important to her, and that is all that matters.

Great casting and setting, scenes that move plot and develop ever-deepening character. I will watch this movie many times, each time taking something new away from it.

I really didn't know what to expect when starting to watch this video;  however, I was very touched and enjoyed the dual dramas going on here - that between the mother & the convict and the one between mother & son, son & female interest.

I liked the honesty of the characters- the premise that bad things can happen to good people- and that people can do the right thing  when pressed with a tough decision.  While the story line may seem unlikely- who cares- it's a movie and I like to be taken to unlikely places in a movie- if you are a romantic dreamer as I am- you will like this- and I won't spoil the ending- other than to say it doesn't mess with your mind- like so many movies do.,1426982400,,554,4.073394495412844

6148919,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Implausible? Irrational? but isn't that what true love is? A movie about two people with tragic pasts (Winslett and Brolin are great in their roles) finding comfort in each other and true love. What leads it astray sometimes is the interlocking story/conflict of Winslett's son which, although an essential part of the story, just doesn't ring true. Yes, the ending is too sentimental and cute and ties everything up too neatly but still is a FEEL GOOD ending and darn it if it didn't bring tears to my eyes. Never really saw any publicity on this movie and I just happened to turn it on thru my Amazon Prime video and glad I did. There are no big bangs, profanities, overt sex, or any other mandatory (or what seems to be) requirements of blockbuster movies these days. It's a quiet adult movie, well acted by grown ups acting like grown ups.",1426896000,,843,4.589403973509934

The interspersed flashbacks keep you guessing, so there are also those ""OMG"" moments toward the end. This is definitely still a chick flick, though, so this will not satisfy the appetite of action/adventure junkies.

I couldn't really figure out what all was going to happen so I was sucked in, but in a weird way compared to that of other movies. It kind of reminded me of a Sundance Film Festival type movie, but the filming was better. It's worth the watch if you're a Kate Winslet fan. I wouldn't buy this movie though, and I'm glad I saved it for a free amazon prime movie download vs renting (although I probably would have rented it).",1426204800,,579,4.178571428571429

Then I thought about all the single women rasing children whose child(ren) dad left them because of FEAR. This man convince her he was not going to hurt her or her child and he took care of them by teaching them to do certain things. This is a good movie for anyone who feel it's not possible to meet a good man or women if you are a single parent.

6149593,3,B00H9LHVHI,Interesting movie and concept. I would call it a semi-romance movie as most of the romance is left to your imagination which isn't all bad. Some holes in the story line and not real accurate as to how a fugitive would be searched for. The fugitive does outside work with a concerned neighbor supposedly watching out for the single lady with known issues and her son.,1425340800,,366,4.5606060606060606

The story was just unbelievable and after I had watched the movie, I couldn't believe that I had wasted the time.  I'm not sure I've ever felt this before.

Theyre both really ace actors who have been doing interesting work for awhile now. Here they star together in a piece of dung slung together by --- Jason Reitman!? I couldn't believe he directed this flaming turd. Id almost suggest watching it just to see how ridiculously schmaltzy and stupid it is and how actors are not immune to making TERRIBLE CHOICES. The movie is about a wronged man who takes this nutso woman and her kid hostage in order to heal up and get out of town after busting from jail. What transpires is some of the dumbest romance Ive ever seen go down in a movie. The pie?!",1425081600,,710,4.427480916030534

6150129,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Had heard about Labor Day movie and glad to see it online.  I was very interested in Josh Brolin as I've not seen his work.  I can never ""identify"" Kate Winslet.  The movie was great; suspenseful, gentle,  sexy but without a lot of sex (scenes).  It is told from the perspective of Kate Winslet 13yr son (who does a great job).  I guess the best thing i appreciate about the movie is its ""plausibility and gentle approach"" (no spoiler) here - however, it you're interested in a romantic-suspense-coming of age story - this is it.

6150598,5,B00H9LHVHI,"Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet truly are spectacular in Labor Day.

Josh Brolin plays Frank a recently escaped convict, convicted of murder.  Kate Winslet plays Adele, a single mother of Henry and who seems to be experiencing a Major Depressive Disorder as well as Social Anxiety brought on by some events in her past.

The story starts out and we see Henry and his mother, the story is told by an adult version of Henry who is recalling the events of one weekend that had a major impact on the rest of his life.  Henry and Adele are taking their monthly trip to the local store for their monthly supplies.  It's really evident that this is a huge struggle for Adele just to make this simple trip.  It's somewhat difficult watching Adele, because I've suffered some of the same anxieties that are portrayed in this movie and in a lot of ways it hit home.  You can tell that Henry feels a huge burden of responsbility to his mother and her well being.

While Henry goes to look at the comics in the store, he's surprised when Frank comes out of the back of the store asking for his help.  Henry notices that Frank is bleeding on his stomach and seems really nervous, but does as Frank is told and takes him to his mother.  HIs mother doesn't want to help, but Frank is pretty insistent and Adele becomes nervous of him hurting them and so goes along with Frank's wishes.

The story shows that while Frank is persistent and in a way has a bit of a threatening demeanor, he also seems to have a gentle nature about him the whole time.  We watch as Frank seems determined to fix all of the little things that are wrong with Adele's home and seems to want to make sure that when he's gone Henry will have learned some invaluable lessons on how to take care of himself and of his mother.

There's so much more I could say and this another of those times when I just want to tell you everything, but then that would ruin the whole movie for you.  This definitely was a unique tale that I've never seen before.  A unique storyline.  It shows that sometimes just because someone has been labeled and even made a dreadful mistake in their past, that it doesn't mean that it dictates that they are a bad person.  It makes you see the human side of even someone who has been convicted as a murderer.

I've watched Josh Brolin in several things, but he truly has outdone himself as Frank.  Kate Winslet, well we all know that she just rocks out whatever character she is portraying and truly becomes that person.  She does such a wonderful job showing the anxiety that this character feels and just with little bitty movements can capture a whole range of emotions.

You find yourself rooting for these people and wanting to see good in them.  It's really a touching story and I found myself in tears towards the end of the movie.  Definitely worth a watch!!  It really shows how one encounter can change the person we become.  How it's little things that can shape our lives.",1424044800,,2961,4.4088397790055245

Am I supposed to be caught up in the idea that this captor is perfect in every single way, aside from a misunderstood incident that put him behind bars years ago?  Am I really supposed to believe that that incident was forgivable because of the nature of the woman he was with?  And am I supposed to believe that these two new lovers would truly transition into a happily ever after love story if only conditions would allow?  All in all, I found this story incredibly disturbing and full of terrible messages to women who need healthy examples of love, forgiveness, and hope.

Injects a breath of fresh air in their lives. And his too. Sadness ensues. But I will say by the time Toby McGuire shows up as the son/kid character and not just the narrator we get a somewhat happy ending. Still leaves you with a hole in your gut about how painfully cruel life can be when our lives are touched by wickedly selfish people. But it is a Winslet movie. Winslet sticks with her hit formula of sad depressing themes here. Think ""Titanic"" and ""The Reader"". One thing I can help out with is that the flashbacks are from BOTH the prisoner and the Winslet character. Both of their pasts are shown and interwoven throughout. At first I thought it was just her past. It was a little confusing.

The back story is as compelling as the front story. The intertwined relationships and the seamless connections to the main story line is beautifully presented. Realistic people, personalities, conditioning, actions and reactions.

Pulls on all heart strings. Left my head and heart in conflict as logic wanted to prevail but was more empathetic with the heart's desire to embrace love even when it was illogical.

6150808,5,B00H9LHVHI,"I honestly had no desire to watch this movie nor did I have any high hopes for it. Yesterday I was  looking for a chick flick while the house was busy with football or a computer game and thought if it sucks I will just move onto another movie.

It didn't suck. In fact, the movie was really good even though I didn't understand or even sympathize with some of it.

Kate Winslet plays Adele, a depressed single mother who suffers from anxiety. Her son Henry played brilliantly by Gattlin Griffith who is also the narrator which is voiced by Tobey Maguire.

One day during their occasional trip to superstore Henry bumps into Frank played by Josh Brolin. Frank needs help. He is bleeding and in a passive-aggressive move gets Kate to drive him to her home where he can rest.

Frank is an escaped prisoner whose photo is information is all over the paper and news but there is another story to his case. Frank is on a murder charge that wasn't really his fault (sob). We see in flashbacks what happened to Frank and it is devastating. We also see via flashbacks why Adele has her anxiety and this is where I had trouble but this review is not about me so moving on.

Adele and Frank fall in love. Henry is in dire need of a father figure and Frank just wants to belong.

I loved everything about this movie. It is brilliant and makes you truly care about all the characters.

The story has a sweet, loving ending that made me cry my eyes out but not because I was sad but hopeful!

Winslet did a fantastic job as Adele! Doesn't get better than this!",1421625600,,1547,4.325259515570934

6150836,3,B00H9LHVHI,"I was looking for a romance and Amazon Prime recommended this. The acting was great, the story okay (a mix of growing up, romance, and dealing with the big and little issues with some adrenaline and extra drama thrown in). Is it a perfect romance? No not at all but the characters are far from perfect as well and it's believable with several sweet moments. Without spoiling anything I will say the ending left a lot to be desired while still attempting to be ""happy."" I do think the main characters should've worked through their own issues individually first but that's another issue. Overall it was okay.
-
Now something I did not expect that needs to be said (real reason I'm taking the time to write this) is my review's title. TRIGGER WARNING! If you are expecting or have lost a child and want to avoid extra anxiety DO NOT WATCH THIS! I would not have watched it had I known though thankfully I was able to skip a lot of the scenes going into A LOT of graphic details (early and with still birth), what I did see I wish I hadn't. And I know many parents that would've been much more negatively affected seeing this. So I hope those people see this review and decide for themselves if they are okay watching or not.

So yes overall ""It's okay"" 3 stars, UNLESS you're expecting/have had a pregnancy loss, or perhaps are dealing with depression. Then skip it!",1421280000,,1364,4.456
6150837,5,B00H9LHVHI,I really enjoyed this movie. Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin made a wonderful pair.  I am glad I took he time to watch.,1421193600,,116,4.043478260869565

6150841,2,B00H9LHVHI,"Perhaps I should learn how to bake pies using only the palms of my hands and my biceps.  And I should be nice to spastics in wheelchairs.  But only when people are looking-- I'm only human!  And when I'm cleaning out rain gutters with my bare hands, I shouldn't make jokes like ""you're next buttercup"" and wink.  Anyhoo.

I didn't like the movie.  In fact I hated it.  My take on the film will spoil it for you, so if you have any intention of watching it, then for the love of god stop reading!!!

The first hour was bizarre and surreal.  The ominious music, and the way Brolin acted with such deliberation made you think she was going to be raped.  They kept up that creepy power and sex thing going for a crazy amount of time.  He sensuously tied her up, and as she was bound to a chair, he slowly spoon fed her.  The way he acted made no sense to me.  When he showed the mother and her kid how to cook a pie by using his powerful arms and meaty hands instead of cooking utensils, I paused the movie and looked up the author, Joyce Maynard, on Wikipedia.  Suddenly the movie made sense:

Maynard attended the ridiculously expensive New Hampshire prep school Exeter.  That explains why that kid was so damn strange and off putting.  Maynard also had a nine month romantic relationship at the age of 18 with the 53 year old JD Salinger.  Now the boundary issues and the borderline rape-y feel at the beginning of the movie also made sense.  I don't make it a habit of looking at the bios of authors, but in this case it was necessary information.

I normally like movies where people's experiences and perspectives are different from my own, within reason.  I thought Brolin's character was written by someone who really didn't understand men in the slightest.  I'd go into more detail, but if you didn't agree with my assessment, nothing I say will be all that convincing.  But even the most die hard romance novel reading chick had to roll her eyes when he says something like ""Hey little misses, I think they done cheated you on your precut and presplit cord of wood.  Now I'll sit in manly silence as you tell me about your dream from last night as I shampoo your hair.""

Besides feeling phony (as Holden may have said in Catcher in the Rye), I also found Brolin's character to be somewhat offensive because he seemed to be written by someone who looked down on those of us who work with our hands and don't have that fancy book learnin'.  I don't mean to sound dismissive of Joyce Maynard as a writer because I know so little about her, but her talents might be better suited to tackling part 2 of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or some other silly play about silly people.  Perhaps the screenplay didn't do the novel justice, but the movie reeked of classism and elitism.  And sexism (are guys allowed to use that word?).  I'd actually like the story more if the murder was intentional.  That way he'd at least have a personality!

I like to watch and read a wide range of things, but I think for the rest of the month I'll be sticking with sci fi and horror.",1421020800,4,3066,4.373451327433628
6150842,5,B00H9LHVHI,"I throughly enjoyed this movie.  I've always been both a Winslet and Brolin fan, but to have them acting together in such a unusal, but touching, love story, was a real treat.  This is one that I'll gladly add to my collect!!",1421020800,3,225,4.333333333333333

I am a firm believer that you should never walk out of a movie because that is disrespectful to the filmmaker, but I have never wanted to leave so badly in my life. This movie is so bad it is disrespectful. While aesthetically pleasing, this film's story and dialogue made me want to go full Helen Keller.

For those that need instant gratification and gave this movie a low rating-you're missing out on all the nuances of life & human interaction! Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet were perfectly matched in acting ability and being able to portray these deep human needs & emotional sufferings that many times go unspoken for a lifetime. I love the movies that Winslet chooses, she isn't afraid to show the many layers, fears, insecurities and strengths of a woman.

6150882,1,B00H9LHVHI,"I give it one star because it is over rated here and at most deserves a solid 3 at best.  Could have been more if there was a better actor/actress for mother and son or better storyline.  They were just weird.  I didn't like the ""Wonder Years"" narrative either, especially the almost male voice almost New Yorky and raspy but ultimately very cheesy.  The mother talking about sex, no ""really talking to him"" about how it makes one feel is very weird to say the least.  I don't know if it was the adaption from book to movie that sucked because I didn't read the book, perhaps it sucked as well. The one thing that didn't suck(thus one star) was Josh Brolin's figure throughout the movie - watching him will help one to finish watching it without a doubt.  The young boy has shifty eyes that was kind of correct as he was kind of shifty too.  The middle aged boy character is just weird looking with his little raisin eyes and puffy face, then that is transformed into Toby McGuire at the end.  So from an olive complexion, dark hair to a mousy blonde, pasty Toby McGuire.  It's like they were banking on Toby McGuire to save this movie for some odd reason. Josh Brolin makes you feel sorry for his character because he always got the short-end of the stick throughout his life with his love choices/family situations.  As an aged man Josh Brolin  still looks good but it looks as if Kate Winslet smells like urine and is suffering from dementia.  The score is also atrocious with the looming music death march anxiety noise booming throughout.",1420848000,2,1543,4.491039426523297

Josh Brolin is so hot and I never thought of him as ""hot"" before. I don't want to spill details so let me just say that the story, if I would compare it to a book, is a page-turner that won;t let you leave your seat.

6151044,2,B00H9LHVHI,"Icky, icky message, that a mom would put her own twisted idea of happiness ahead of her son's. Maybe in the book, the Kate Winslet character comes across as more unstable than the movie version, but I just couldn't buy the premise that an escaped convict could threaten his way into the woman's home (gripping her boy around the neck to make his point), tie them up now and again and put them into choke holds when anyone comes to the door, and yet by the end of the movie, she's running off with him to Canada! Because he fixes cars and can make a pie! He washes floors and does electrical work! So, sure, take the kid away from his life and his father, make him an accessory to crime, and make a wreck of his life. Because you're in love! Beyond that, I just have to say that no public library is open on Sunday (as in this movie) and no small-town public library looks like the light-infused, steel-and-glass emporium they've created for this film. I'm not sure which of these fabrications I objected to more!",1420416000,,1012,4.388297872340425

The message was powerful and strong, not overly pithy and unrealistically sentimental, but touching and deep just the same.  I love a story that takes a deeper look at what shapes peoples lives and challenges me to consider how I look at others when I only know what I see.  The storyline was original and unexpected, but not unrealistic either.  It gave me neither the tragic nor the fairy tale ending, but rather the bittersweet resolution it deserved.

The tension created from beginning to end of this movie was fabulous.  It was reminiscent of old Hitchcock movies but more nuanced.  I don't want to cause any spoilers so cannot speak too much about the content but suffice it to say, this was a fine film, with excellent performances of all characters, fabulous direction and camera work and a fabulous, too rarely seen type of ending.  It is a shame that the mainstream reviewers so missed the boat on this one!  Great work Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and Director Jason Reitman and wonderful voice work by Tobey McQuire.  Well done.  Thank you for a wonderfully entertaining and engrossing story.",1420243200,,762,4.8604651162790695
6151281,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Yes I gave it 3 stars for the superb acting.  Some parts of the story make you empathize for Kate Winslet's character but even more so  for her son and her ex-husband. Josh Brolin's character in this movie is a convict loving woman's fantasy.  A gentle sensitive convict, who after 20 plus years in jail appears to be menacing and will hold you captive and your child by the throat when threatened, is 'just misunderstood'.  Josh's character is the poor woman's Elliot Grey. This movie is obscene in some parts with how the child is exposed to his mother's issues and her serious lack of intimate boundaries.  This is not a love story. In the real world it's a recipe for the slaughtering of a woman and her child.",1420243200,2,714,4.503875968992248

6151305,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Many have noted that it's not always the destination that is important. It's the road you take to get there that is. With ""Labor Day"" I should have taken the detour.

Here's the scoop. A divorced mother (Kate Winslet) and her son (Gattlin Griffith) are abducted in a discount store by Josh Brolin who has escaped from a prison hospital. He holes up in their home until his leg heals enough for him to beat it. He doesn't seem a bad sort though and ends up bringing a much needed bonding to the home and lost love back to Kate. Can this work out?

This starts out well enough, and you can see pretty quickly where it's going, so you want to sit back and enjoy the ride. Soon, though, things go pretty bad. It's as though they knew what had to be done with the story but were unable to do so. They introduce a quirky, way to self aware and savvy young lady later in the film that is supposed to get the wheels rolling for the climax, but I didn't believe her and I can't see where Winslet's son would have either. He seems bright and what she proposes is contrary to what he's been experiencing in this situation. The viewer sees that he's not quite buying into it, but suddenly he does. Then it's wiped away in a flash. This should have been pivotal and integral to the climax but they missed that train. And some of the other plot points seemed forced as well. Yes. Winslet's heart is broken, and for good reason. But would she really give in to a guy who is an escaped convict? And Brolin's back story is tragic, but he's on the lam and though he certainly would not do his captives any harm, would he put himself in jeopardy as he did? I just couldn't buy it. His parting words to her were almost painful to listen to. Then there's the pivotal scene with James Van Der Beek. Didn't believe that either.

At 111 minutes this also ran on bit too long. And what was Clark Gregg, J.K. Simmons and Tobey Maguire doing in these nearly nonexistent roles? They must have been doing Ivan Reitman a favor.

I've seen a few of Reitman's films and generally like them quite a bit. But his sensibilities seem to have abandoned him here. This isn't a bad watch but it could have been so much better.",1420243200,,2187,4.27536231884058

6151440,3,B00H9LHVHI,"I love director Jason Reitmans UP IN THE AIR, JUNO and THANKS FOR SMOKING.  Each film is well-written and demands direction that can either handle changes in tone (from comedy to drama and back) or a traditionally difficult tone (satire/black comedy, as in .SMOKING).  Yet Reitman handled them all exceedingly well, almost effortlessly.

LABOR DAY asks for a movie that juggles tone between drama/romance/coming-of-age.  Reitman doesnt entirely fumble the ball here, but there are some mis-steps that prevent me from saying he kept his winning streak going.

Josh Brolin has escaped from prison for a crime of passion that was perhaps really just an accident.  The cops are after him, so he forces a single mother (Kate Winslet) and her young teenage son (Gattlin Griffith) to take him home and hide him.  Winslets character is damagedher husband (Clark Gregg) divorced her some years back and the loss of love has exacerbated her tendency towards depression.  She barely goes outside any more, and her poor son is becoming reclusive himself, feeling a great responsibility to take care of mom.  Brolin apparently is able to size up all these dynamics pretty quickly, and through some nice comments and some good cooking, he quickly wins the affections of his captors, in particular Winslet, who clearly is VERY, VERY eager to have the warmth of affection from a man again.

I won't say much more, except to note that the level of delusion these adult characters display as they contemplate a permanent relationship, is pretty hard to believe.  And thats the problem of the movie.  It has just a few too many moments that are hard to believe, and Reitmans usual sure touch isn't up to making them passable.  In one scene, the family bakes pies from some homegrown peaches a neighbor has dropped by.  The scene devolves into a laughable, unintentional homage to the clay pot making scene from GHOST.  Only one movie per century or so can get away with having a man and woman get all hot and bothered by smushing their hands together into some slimy stuff.  GHOST has us covered for another generation or two.

Brolins character is just too good to believe as well.  Hes an escaped prisoner/kidnapper with a heart of gold.  The movie almost seems to want us to think that he kidnapped Winslet on purpose so that they could have a pre-destined romancerather than think that he would have kidnapped ANYONE (man or woman) with a car and a vaguely vulnerable look.  He was running for his life, after all.

Also, the lighting in the movie is FRAUGHT.  Every scene seems to feature ideal lighting streaming in through a window or pouring through the leaves of trees.  The whole movie comes across like a really high-class Lifetime Network film.  It needed a bit more roughnessalthough then it would have been much tougher to make Brolin likeable and Winslets attraction believable.  I haven't read the book, but its just possible that there is no way to make LABOR DAY entirely convincing.

Not all is lost.  Brolin does what he can, and Winslet is never less than interesting.  Young Griffith does a fine job.  Hes clearly caught between the connection hes made with Brolin, his need for a true father-figureand his clear understanding that this guy is a fugitive and a potential danger.  Their relationship may be the most easy to believe in the filmalthough they bond over playing ball, which seems like the biggest clich&eacute; they could have come up with.  There are some fun cameos from folks as diverse as JK Simmons and James Van Der Beek (creepy and effective).  And while often laughable, and almost always straining credulity, LABOR DAY was never boring, and at the end, I found I actually cared a bit about what happened to everyone.  (Although the grown boy [Tobey Maguire] ends up picking the most eye-rolling line of work I can imagine.)

If you're up for a romance with better than usual actors, and your tolerance for unlikely character choices and treacle isn't too strained, you may find LABOR DAY worthwhile.  I give it a respectable 3 stars.",1417392000,,4057,4.838896952104499

6151448,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Labor Day is a film that is based on the novel of Joyce Maynard with the same title. The story focuses on the experiences of 13-year-old Henry Wheeler, who struggles to be the man of his house and care for his reclusive and depressed mother Adele,who was left by her husband. While they are clothes shopping, a bloody man approaches Henry and makes them take him home to look after him. The man happens to be Frank Chambers, a convict who is wanted by the local police after escaping from prison. Certain events happen in this long Labor Day weekend which includes a romance developed between Frank and Adele. Also,we get to see the story of Frank as he reaches adulthood that includes his becoming a Vietnam War veteran,his marriage to Mandy, and his success as a baker owner. At the conclusion,we get to see Frank released from prison after serving his sentence and consummates his love for Adele through marriage.

This is definitely a melodramatic film from beginning to end. It tries to capture and manipulates one's emotion especially when the romantic story between Frank and Adele is being told. Obviously,the film is far from being realistic and the narrative is full of flaws as it tries to be an emotionally centered kind of film. There was escapism applied no question about it. That is why many movie critics hated it. But nevertheless,I would consider this one good film if one is willing to overlook reality as Kate Winslet provided an honest and sincere performance as Adele that the viewer will definitely find no difficulty in finding empathy and sympathy to her character Adele. Josh Brolin also did well as Frank and his chemistry with Kate was able to complement Kate's acting. In the end,I would give this a high rating if only for the stellar performance of Kate Winslet alone and one would overlook the flaws of the story.",1416614400,,1846,4.750778816199377

6151481,5,B00H9LHVHI,Love love love Love....I have watched this movie over and over. Not sure how you could hate it. True Love story. I never  felt threatened by Frank so maybe that's why it seemed more plausible. If I thought he could or would hurt either of them I wouldn't have got so lost in it. There's no stockholm syndrome here.  I grew up in the 80s and this seems older to me.  Found this movie totally by accident and so happy I did.,1414713600,,422,4.121951219512195

6151501,4,B00H9LHVHI,"If ever a movie needed a better DVD cover this is the one, I had originally written off picking this one up as some sort of chick flick romance novel turned into a film.  In fact the spiel on the back ridiculously even starts of in huge letters, ""Not Since the Notebook""  However I saw a preview for a film about an escaped murderer fugitive who forces a mother and her son to take him to their home that looked pretty good in the previews of another movie, and to my surprise when I tracked it down the one with the romance cover was it.  This can't be right, I thought, but it was.

It's not a bad film either.  The golden rule in this sort of situation is never let anyone tie you up, as you're then powerless to let them do whatever they want. In fact when in the proximity of others in the supermarket at the start, don't go off alone with someone would have been the smart thing to do, so it was a bit unrealistic but then again Kate Winslet's character was a bit mentally damaged due to events you will learn about as the film goes on, so perhaps this would play a factor in her decision making processes. This is a film that explores Stockholm syndrome or is it doing this?  There's a few holes in the story, such as it's a small town, surely local gossip would have mentioned a loner woman was with some guy at the supermarket which should have made the townsfolk put two and two together.  Some of the deleted scenes or alternate scenes in the extras would have made more sense to have been included or used instead.

Overall it's not a bad film, give it a go despite the bad cover.",1413244800,,1592,4.19672131147541

Well, after watching the movie about a third of the way through it just didnt' hold hers or my interest.  Kate Winslet was very good in her role but I didn't care for Josh Brolin's portrayal of his character.  You felt nothing for him because he came across so gruff.

6151530,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Labor Day in a nice slow paced subtle love story told from the view of the young son.  Kate Winslet does a very good job portraying a mother on the very edge of the breaking point, who is pulled back to life by a slow building romance with an escaped convict who makes them give him a ride to their home from a store.  Frank, the escaped convict, turns out to be a nice polite and helpful man.  In back flash you learn the secret of both of their pasts that lead them to the situation they are in.  While not giving away the end, if they had not ended the film the way they did I probably would have been upset and not liked it.  Again, it is a slow paced film so watch it in a relaxed attitude and you will enjoy the acting.  Worth watching.",1411776000,,742,3.97972972972973

6151553,5,B00H9LHVHI,"This was a sweet romantic movie with some drama and without being overly maudlin. I enjoyed the character development and interactions. There was a certain realism to the characters because nothing was to excess. The mother of the narrator(played by Kate Winslet) had some emotional issues due to her past but she was not bordering on psychosis. The father who liked his new family over his past marriage was a bit selfish at times but not cruel and demonstrative against his first son or his first wife. Instead, he felt guilt over his inability to handle their problems. The escaped convict(played by J. Brolin) had his moments of indecision and harshness but he loved the family and he made an impact in their lives even after their separation. There was a well developed plot and you felt the ending matched the overall feel of the movie.",1411603200,,842,4.773972602739726

A new angle that sometimes life is what happens to you and there isn't always an explanation, a reason or that you deserve these things.  A view into what it can take to mend and the unlikely people who help you heal.  A hometown story on the national news, but privately and deliberately played out.

Others here reviewing the movie, might not have had enough life experience to understand other peoples problems. I really did enjoy it and glad it turned out for the couple.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and maybe this movie wasn't as the say ""their cup of tea"".  Really wonder if Josh Brolin can cook?

6151738,3,B00H9LHVHI,"There may be spoilers.

A terrific cast and an excellent director (Jason Reitman), are usually enough to draw an audience.  The film starts off beautifully with Frank (Josh Brolin), a convicted murderer, escaping from prison near a small town in New England in 1987.  He shows up at a local grocery, hobbled and bleeding and pretending to be an employee.  In a very veiled way, he threatens a young Henry (Gattlin Griffith) and his single mother, Adele (Kate Winslet) to drive him to their house.

Adele has her own issues having been jilted by her ex-husband (Clark Gregg) and has fallen into a depressive state, complete with jittery hands.  I'm not quite sure what happened to the storyline once they get to the house.  Perhaps a less compliant Adele and Henry might have made this film a bit more believable.  But, it seems that Frank, the convicted murderer, is perfect husband material.  Handy around the house, tosses baseballs with the kid, is a great cook and is easy on the eyes.  The adults soon get cozy and comfortable but not so much to move the film off its PG-13 rating.

So what's the deal with Frank and the murder thing?  We get to see it all in flashback as a younger Frank (Tom Lipinski) had been married before to a cheating floozy (Maika Monroe), who never changes her ways, even after they have a child.  Based on the flashback scenes, the ""murders"" were accidental, but the jury found differently.

After avoiding the police for days, the new family decide to make a dash for Canada.  Slip ups can occur, especially with a teen making the transition to adulthood that includes a chance meeting with a newly arrived hottie (Brighid Fleming).  I would have to give this film a mild recommendation.  I wish it could have provided a bit more tension and a little less melodrama.  The acting is solid throughout including that of young Griffith.

The Blu ray transfer exemplifies what modern HD sources can look like.  Beautiful textures and detail can be seen in clothing and in Adele's home.  Black levels are excellent.  Colors are believable and skin tones are perfect.  Lighting is perfect, both inside and outside.  Resolution is 1080p and the aspect ratio is 2.40:1.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is very good as well.  This is a dialog based film so the first thing I'm concerned about it the clarity.  It is naturally centered and well presented.  Other than some police sirens and a minimalistic yet excellent score, the surrounds are fairly placid. Subtitles are available in French, Spanish, Portuguese, English and English SDH.  There is a director/co-producer commentary track, a ""making of"" featurette, and some deleted scenes.",1407542400,4,2677,4.809210526315789

But what I got instead was a tender and yet serious movie about people who are put (or maybe put themselves in the case of one of the main characters) into very difficult situations by twists of fate. I especially liked Kate Winslet in the main role. She comes across very believably as wounded but still with an underlying toughness The young man in the movie also did a very good job. Finally, I liked how the director built the tension in the movie, transposing the back story of the characters through their first trials and tribulations with the current situation and building tension.

I think the film could have been somewhat salvaged if the music and soundtrack was not so overly done. The effort to move you emotionally needs to be subtle and needs to be economically dispensed. This was delivered in a dump truck that never stopped dumping. Killed any life that this film could have had.

As they discover each other during the Labor Day weekend and make plans to run away to Canada, we just know happiness is not in the immediate offing; and sure enough, it isn't.  Kate looks so good there ought to be some sex scenes, but the relationship here is subdued.

""Labor Day"" takes some highly improbable material and somehow makes it work - up to a point, at least.

In fact, it's kind of hard to know exactly what to make of ""Labor Day"" at first blush. The movie, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard, tells the tale of a love- and sex-starved single mother (Kate Winslet) who falls in love with the ""dreamy"" escaped convict (Josh Brolin) who's holding her and her 13-year-old son (Gattlin Griffith) hostage in their rural home on Labor Day weekend 1987. For about the first 45 minutes or so, the movie actually seems to be endorsing the rather insulting romantic premise that all an attractive young woman needs to spice up her life is a gutter-cleaning, pie-making, baseball-instructing, son-loving man to come along and sweep her off her feet -.criminal background be damned. But as the focus of our attention shifts from the two unlikely lovers and onto the son who's observing and ultimately commenting on this bizarre situation, the movie deepens into an off-beat and thought-provoking look into the complexities of human nature and of familial relationships (Tobey Maguire provides the narration as the grown-up Henry and makes a brief appearance later in the movie).

Winslet, Brolin and Griffith all give remarkable performances, as do Robert Clark Gregg and James Van Der Beek in supporting roles. Jason Reitman`s moody screenplay and muted direction achieve a dreamy, almost hallucinatory quality that transports the tale to the realm of allegory or fable, where credibility doesn`t play quite so crucial a role in our overall appreciation of it (a young girl`s noting the parallels between what`s happening here and the highly fictionalized and romanticized ""Bonnie and Clyde"" puts the theme into sharp focus).

The movie constantly blurs the line between good and evil, and makes it clear that most things are never quite as clear or as black-and-white as people choose to believe they are, especially when it comes to affairs of the heart.

It's a shame that after all this, the authors just couldn't resist tacking on a Lifetime Channel-like coda that indulges in all the dime-novel slickery and sentimentality that they've admirably managed to avoid for most of the movie up to that point. Still, ""Labor Day"" largely triumphs over its potentially troublesome material with its quality performances and direction.",1404518400,,2373,5.105670103092783

6152045,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Let me start by saying though I am a chick, I am not a chick flick fan. I tend to like action, thriller, and comedy films. Mindless entertainment mostly. But sometimes a girls gotta shake up the norm. This was certainly not your usual romantic drama. And it requires a certain suspension of disbelief given the circumstances of the movie. It was certainly helped by the actors josh brolin, Kate winslet and especially the son, Gattlin Griffith. This was a surprise to me, that it liked it. It certainly dragged in spots. But overall an engaging unique drama.",1403308800,2,558,4.704081632653061

No sane person would do that.  I like the ""idea"" of it, from a romanticized stance -  but logically it just would never happen.

6152072,2,B00H9LHVHI,"This movie's slow pace would have been much more palatable had there been some emotional depth and dialog to sink into. Instead we get a depressed single mom who almost never smiles or laughs, her son whose narrative is simply not interesting, and Frank, the escaped convict who never says a word about who he is but loves to cook and fix things around the house. Also, there are way too many unexplained and choppy montages of the mom's past, and the background music is often heavy and annoying. I think the pie baking scene was the beginning of my undoing: ""Like water for chocolate"" meets ""Bridges of Madison county"" on Valium.",1402704000,,631,4.642857142857143

It slowly and deliberately illustrates the stories of the lives of two misunderstood people and how their hardships make them able to understand each other. The other beauty of this movie is how it shows how a caring man can make a real impact on a young boy's life. I enjoyed this more than anything I've seen in years. Very romantic and moving.

6152094,5,B00H9LHVHI,"Wow. I am NOT a big love story kind of person, but I really, really enjoyed this. Not sure why, exactly... terrific actors certainly is a part of it. I think my main reason is that it's unexpected... and it really shows the complexities of whom we are as a species. We are complicated; few things about us can be described in black and white terms.

I enjoyed the feel of the film - the pace of it. The music was perfect. And it was NOT depressing. I don't care for depressing films; I see enough pain in my career. I was half expecting a depressing story and was happily ""disappointed.""

Well done!",1402358400,,599,4.292035398230088
6152095,4,B00H9LHVHI,"I try to only describe anything in the movie thats in the preview, so as not to give spoilers, but I had ONE complaint about not letting people know there are spoilers in my reviews. I really don't think so, but be wary anyway. I was going to see this while it was in the theater, but it got past over for an Oscar nod, so I waited until it cam out on DVD. There were just too many movies to see that were nominated and I didn't have time to bother with the ones that werent. I am kind of a nerd and try to watch as many of the Oscar noms as I can before the Oscars. I wouldnt say I should have seen this in the theaters because, as I said I just didn't have time. I am glad that I did eventually see it. If I had known how good it was, I wouldve seen it sooner. When I saw the preview for it, I remember my friend said, I hope there is more to this movie than that. Well there really isnt. It is just about Josh Brolin escaping from prison and holding Kate Winslett and her son hostage for Labor Day weekend and they all come to love each other. You would think it would be boring, but it wasn't boring at all. It was actually pretty riveting. The acting and character development were flawless. Josh Brolin is just too good to be true. I don't care if hes a convict, I want to marry him. I thought time was a little askew though. At one point, I thought it must be Monday now and it was only Friday. I thought, wow Josh Brolin did all that in like a day. He fixes their car and a bunch of other things. I love the relationship that grows not only with Winslett, but her son. I really like how Brolin becomes kind of a father figure to him. Im not really familiar with the actor, but he did a great job. Theres also this sultry sexy under-tone to it. Wherever it takes place is hot because everyone is glistening.  This movie will stay with you. You will be thinking abut it days later. Its just a well written and well filmed script.",1402358400,,1935,4.0

However, the movie appeared to play for a few short weeks before it was no longer available, and the movie reviews I came across were lukewarm at best.  Therefore, this movie was promptly removed to the ""DVD release"" list.

After a long week at the office, I decided that tonight was the night to order this movie from Amazon and ""let it watch me"".  Man, was I wrong!  This movie grabbed my attention from the start!  The acting/chemistry between Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet was magical!  This movie was a love story at it's finest...the ending literally made me cry, and I've since watched the movie 3x!  The last ""chick flick"" that caught my attention to this degree was ""Titanic""!

6152151,5,B00H9LHVHI,"Once in a while a rare film comes along that simply dazzles in its simplicity, its skewed characters, its interior life fomenting to be loosed. ""Labor Day"" is just such a film. I absolutely love this movie.

When one considers life, one possibly thinks of Good winning, of normal people living out their lives. However, Jason Reitman considered those other people, those in need, those by-passed of happiness, of normalcy. These people live one day at a time--barely. Such is Kate Winslet's character, who suffers from depression, debilitating sadness, loss, and simply cannot get herself together. After so many mind-boggling miscarriages, her husband, a good man, cannot take any more and leaves, finds a new wife and starts a new life. Their son moves back and forth between his parents, although in this story, he is with his mother. He becomes the omniscient narrator who provides the viewer with back story and ongoing actions.

Into their closed lives one day comes an intruder, a prison escapee. From the time he enters the story, I felt a bristling, an undercurrent, a sense of violence just waiting to explode. That's Josh Brolin, perfectly cast for this role. He reads immediately into the character of Adele, sensing that she is very lonely and troubled. He is gentle with her. Their growing attraction is beautifully drawn.

But happiness in such doomed characters cannot last. Two new characters are introduced and it is through them that the love story is crushed. The viewer cannot help but weep for their loss. Life goes on. That incessant droning of inertia is re-instilled in both Frank's and Adele's lives. However, this is not a Nicholas Sparks story--no one dies. And the ending--the ending is magnificent! The viewer will weep here, too.

My brother loves chick flick movies. I keep telling him this is a ""chick flick"" not to be missed, but he's not there--yet. When he is, he will thank me.",1401753600,,1914,4.91640866873065

Depressed single mom Adele and her son Henry are forced into offering a wounded, fearsome man a ride. As police search town for the escaped convict, the mother and son gradually learn his true story as their options become increasingly limited.

What did I think?

Labor Day is an odd, slow-burning movie that doesn't quite deliver. While it was refreshing to watch a slow-paced movie try to develop characters it never quite managed to gel and the events felt unrealistic. Yet it was interesting enough it left you longing for that extra insight and feeling.

6152175,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Author Joyce Maynard, who has obsessively chronicled her own life in print, and  most notably her romance as a teenager with reclusive old goat JD Salinger, conjures up the ultimate smart girls' fantasy man in Labor Day.

He's wounded, both literally and figuratively, but despite a murder charge hanging over his head, he is the strongest most compassionate man on earth. He is a giver. He knows how to fix everything that is broken- houses, cars and human hearts.  He  cooks gourmet meals from canned ingredients and bakes scrumptious pies, and did I mention that he actually cleans up after himself and irons to boot? And did I also mention that he comes in the ruggedly handsome package of Josh Brolin?!

Ladies, put the critical portion of your brains on hold and settle back into this gentle tale--as Frank [ Brolin] comes into depressed and neglected divorcee's Adele [ Winslet] and her son Henry's life for one long weekend. As they harbor him from 'justice', he transforms their lives by bolstering Adele's self regard and profoundly influencing young Henry's future.

Men -if you are watching, this is a good time to pick up some pointers. If you can't stand it, rent  Clint Eastwood's A Perfect World with Kevin Costner which would be the manly equivalent of this film.",1401408000,,1280,4.844036697247707

6152191,4,B00H9LHVHI,"I would normally classify this movie as a drama that would appeal to women more than men but ""not-so-fast""!

There are a number of deep messages found in this story that should appeal to men, especially men with complex relationships with their male children.

In my normal rating scheme that includes story, acting, direction and production values I would have to say that ""Labor Day"" struck a solid cord on all fronts. I consider the story to be the strong suit of this movie and I would recommend it to my men friends to assist them in helping their male children move through their teenage years. Don't misconstrue how men actually come across to their female spouses/significant others and their teenage sons. There are many pitfalls that a man can enter if they are clueless to this important interaction.

There was one slightly weakened character and that is the mother played by Kate Winslet but that is to be expected because of the way that the writer created her character (having difficulties of her own), but Josh Brolin and Gatlin Griffith were spot on.

So he decides that he will leave by train, but the train doesn't run that weekend, because its a holiday(which of course is Labor Day weekend).

Brolin has been doing a lot of roles, as a runaway convict he does well in this film. Kate Winslet is convincing as always, she does well but the story has a few loopholes which are kind of hard to believe. The romance that develops between two people for instance out of nothing at all. Also there is a parallel story going on, I have no idea what that story was about, after a while I thought things will add up but until the end I had no idea what they are going on about. This film is a bit romantic with how it takes itself but that is also its strength. I however think it could have been made a lot better, the screenplay could have been better, the dialogues more unnerving and believable. Overall, this is not a bad film, it deserves to be viewed by everyone but it doesn't succeed in standing out.

They both gave great performances but the film itself drags a bit as the script doesn't really gives them much direction to move on quicker and as you are watching the film you will see why. so, you get to really know each character and it makes you want to root for them to succeed.

6152280,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Labor Day is the latest effort from the acclaimed director Jason Reitman, known for such works as Thank You For Smoking Juno and Up in the Air. Those who are looking for wit and satire will be surprised at the melodramatic story of Labor Day about an unlikely pair of lovers played by Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin. Though the film is beautifully shot, well-acted (with Golden Globe nominated Winslet), and meticulously detailed, there is something implausible about the story that is too sweet and sentimental.

Set in summer, 1987, Labor Day follows the story of a 13-year-old boy Henry (Gattlin Griffith) and his depressed mother Adele (Kate Winslet). While shopping, they are approached by a grim-looking stranger Frank, who asks them to give him a lift. Unable to resist, Adele and Henry take him to their home, where it is revealed that Frank is an escaped convict.

What follows is a love story seen from a young boys viewpoint. Frank also becomes a sort of surrogate father to Henry. The film has too much voiceover, with too little progress in the storyline, though the two leading players Brolin and Winslet provide genuine emotions. Labor Day is a decent drama with strong performances that barely cover up the weakness in the story.",1400457600,13,1243,4.8584905660377355

6152305,4,B00H9LHVHI,"I so rarely enjoy new movies. There is very little to appreciate about most of the (rehashed) fare that's out there these days. However, Jason Reitman's directing drew me to this story. How wrong can you go with a director that gave us Juno or Up In The Air? The two lead characters are played with skill by Winslet and Brolin. The part of the young boy, Henry, was played with skill as well. The thing that really stood out (as another reviewer pointed out) was that this was much more of a heavy DRAMA than Reitman's other pieces, but the MOOD and the music surrounding this story were PERFECT. Although the plot is fairly simple and straightforward, you really end up believing that this could really happen, in a real-life situation. Only part not so believable was Adele's lack of fear through the first few encounters with Frank, as I would imagine any woman would be screaming to help save her son from a potential killer. It was never explained HOW Frank ended up being a murderer, but this didn't seem to sway Adele's affections for him. I very much applaud Jason Reitman (most of all) for helming a story this good.

There were spans of time in the movie when there was no talking, and so much tension and feeling was expressed through close ups of faces with just perfect music.  I was really scared and had no idea what was going to happen next.  The characters were developed slowly throughout the movie.  I had no idea what would happen next.

6152335,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Well, this was perfectly cast with perfectly great performances.  The so called hardened criminal Frank ( Josh Brolin)  plays this escapee in the beginning of the movie like he's capable of pulling a Charles Manson when he kidnaps a vulnerable mother and son. They spend the next few days held up in the house where they find a deep need for each other and become a family.  The outside world is where there's the real danger.
 Painful memories are flashbacks in the film to give the viewer a reason they are all so fractured.  As the search is on going for this fugitive, the three decide to leave their town together and start all over. Finally Adele (Kate Winslet) can find strength to start over after being left to raise her son alone.  Won't be easy to fool neighbors, police, and suspicious bank tellers when they start folding up shop.
 The ending is all you can stand.  Cross your fingers type of ending. Kate Winslet is
Fine as the reclusive yet devoted mother to Henry.
You'll like the overall story.  The actors make it come alive without props or scenic overload.  You can read it in their eyes.

6152369,2,B00H9LHVHI,"a man kidnaps a divorced, depressed woman and her pre-teen son who live in a small town from a store, forcing them to take him home with them. upon arrival he precedes to charm them by feeding them, teaching them how to bake a pie, showing the son how to throw a ball and change a tire. in short order the woman falls in love with him, even though he admits to being an escaped convict, and her son also greatly likes the man.

the problem with stories like these for me as a woman is that in reality the world is so largely misogynistic that I simply do not enjoy seeing women characters violated and then grow to love their violators, period. when I was younger I used to read books and watch movies with similar themes, but I've long grown out of such nonsense. nothing that the man did after kidnapping the pair made him appealing and I couldn't get past how they met.

I read the book not knowing what it was about and thought how the writer had the convict enter the story was totally unbelievable. in the book the author had the bleeding man approach the son/mother and ask for help, which they gave him. at least in the movie, he kidnapped them, which was more believable than a woman with her child agreeing to help a bleeding male stranger at a store by giving him a lift. I mean, I could have accepted in the novel if she'd called 911 but I just don't think many people would take a bleeding stranger home. I viewed the movie to see how the screenwriter would handle the story. the screenwriter did a better ""meet"" than the author did, but the Kate Winslet character still fell in love with him for no reason I could see. story just doesn't work for me. acting all around is fine. did not like the music.",1400025600,,1715,4.273846153846153

From the moment the music score began playing I knew it was not at all what I might have expected.  The plot is an interesting expose on relationships and human behavior.  It is developed via the present intermingled with flashes of the past of the two main characters. The story line is not a hearts and flowers love story, as the promotional photo might suggest, but rather a story of people wounded by their pasts who stumble across each other and over the course of a weekend, Labor Day weekend, retrieve facets of their strength, dignity and hopefulness in an unexpected and unlikely circumstance.

No, this will not be a spoiler, I am not telling if you get a happy end or not, just that this is the kind of film that makes you hope for it.

Brolin is a prison escapee, running from 18 years for murder, and Winslet a single mother with a smart teenage son. Son knows that his mother has serious mental problems, such as agoraphobia. We are in a small town near Boston.

6152386,5,B00H9LHVHI,"I haven't had a chance to see Labor Day since the Telluride Film Festival but my affections for it still hold strong. It continues to be one of my favorite films from Telluride 2013 and was in my top 10 of last year. I absolutely adore Jason Reitmans films, especially Up in the Air, which I saw three times in theaters. It has left me in tears many times, and Im sure it will do so many more times. Clearly, I have a pro-Reitman bias.

However, Labor Day is a very different film for Reitman. Rather than being sharp and quick-witted, its careful and considered. Before the Telluride screening, he introduced the film as a story about love, so I was shocked when the film began as a thriller in which an escaped convict kidnaps a single mother and her 12-year-old son. Although still as Reitman said, its a gentle, loving story.  Rather than following someone dodging police bullets or breaking into buildings, Reitman lets the camera calmly glide up streets and around trees in the quiet yet intense New England setting or watch three people bake a pie together.

The sincerity of Labor Day allows it to be about whatever you relate to. I latched onto the films ideas about parenting. The boys father is around once a week, but is not truly mindful and present with his son. Somehow this escaped convict comes into their lives, and touches both mother and son, because he truly pays attention to them. Only a great filmmaker can take a seemingly absurd premise and put the whole theater in tears. Reitman achieves this with grace, further revealing how exceptionally talented he is.

6152402,5,B00H9LHVHI,"Wow, it is rare these days to watch a movie that has any real ""heart"" to it; a movie that explores what everyone longs for.  It is also about how screwed up our lives become in ways we didn't see coming, like Frank winding up in prison ""when he never intentionally hurt anybody.""  Or how second chances come from some of the oddest places.  Of course, I'd make this about God, that's how I'd interpret it.  It wasn't presented in a spiritual context at all, but really, only God can give you what your heart most desires, and only God can bring such redemption out of the most unlikely ways.  I'm not an advocator for running around with guys who have escaped from prison, but God can use anything.  Frank is just what Adele needs in her woman's heart and around the house.  Frank is also what Henry needs, because every little boy and girl needs a man to see them and value them.  Barry needs this, too, and recognizes the genuine deal.  His heart sings, too.  I guess one of the coolest parts about this movie is that it is so well written and so well acted by the entire cast that such a bazaar happening is totally believable.  Seldom do you see a movie now days where people are valued and a man emulates what it truly means to be a man. Frank used his strength and his gentleness to heal and lift other people up.

6152439,1,B00H9LHVHI,"Signs of cheap and formulaic writing right off the bat:
1. Opening scenes of moving along a road; lots of shots of trees; small town buildings.
2. The formula of showing news on the tele to set up most of the story as well as convey unseen police and public concern i.e. another escaped convict - be alert!
3. Cheap overuse of narration to tell the story when more creative ways can be found.
4. Not believable reaction of passive acceptance by family to convict. The whole story seemed contrived and artificial. If trying for the ""Stockholm Syndrome"" it failed.

Being a fan of Winslet, I decided to give this a watch even though this movie is not the usual movie that I would watch. Winslet does well at playing the self isolated emotional wreck but for me the movie was slow moving and seemed flat to me, emotionally at times. A guy forces you to drive him to your home, etc and both mom and son are very muted and monotone in their reactions. I can appreciate the concept that the movie tries to go for but the first half of the movie plodded along like a slow moving train and pretty much lost me. The love story if made a bit more probable would have held my interest a bit more because after it got there was actually a decent ending, unfortunately the beginning really lost me.

6152466,3,B00H9LHVHI,"Who ever thought that it was a good idea for Tobey Maguire to narrate anything?  I mean, have these casting directors ever heard him talk?  Can you honestly tell me that you like listening to his whiney voice tell you everything that you can see clearly and don't need narrated?  I mean, I absolutely hate narration for the sake of narration (oh, lets tell a story) but if I have to suffer through someone vocalize every event on the screen, at least make their voice soothing or enjoyable.  When you factor in that the character Maguire is vocalizing is previously portrayed (in a two minute sequence, but still) by Dylan Minnette who has a voice that is drastically deeper than Maguires, it all feels so dumb.  I already had to suffer through his terrible narration in The Great Gatsby, but at least he was a prominent actor there.  Here, he bakes a pie.  They could have got anyone to do that.

I promise, this isn't a review of Tobey Maguire, the actor that never was.

Anyways, that was the first thought that I had while watching Labor Day.  The second thought I had was why is Jason Reitman directing this?  I ask that because nothing about Labor Day feels like a Reitman film, which is odd since he has, until this moment, carried such a distinct style of filmmaking.  Thank Your For Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air, Young Adultwhile all different films all share a very similar tonal structure.  He knows how to make a really biting dramedy.

Labor Day is not a dramedy.

Labor Day tells the story of Adele, a single mother living alone with her son, harboring a tortured past that has left her emotionally unmovable and pretty much incapable of human interaction.  Her son, Henry, assumes that she has slipped into depression thanks to his father, Gerald, leaving her for his secretary, but comments made in passing paint a picture that reaches back further than that.  Adele never leaves the home, but once a month to get supplies.  On one of these ventures out into the world, they come across Frank.  Hes bleeding and obviously on the run and he pushes himself on Adele and her son and winds up at their house.  He explains that hes an escaped convict and just needs a place to hide out until nightfall.  What was supposed to be a single day lasts much longer as Adele and Frank start to fall in love and plan a life together, with Henry at their side.  Their pasts come to the fore and their secrets are revealed and, well, there will be much sadness.

What to say, what to say?  First, that pie making scene made me hungrier than Ive ever been while watching a movie; no joke.  Second, the second half of this movie was so much sadness on top of sadness that I couldn't even process it fast enough to care.  Adeles backstory is sad enough, but then Frank gets into explaining what happened to him and why he was arrested and its a whole ton of misery and I was just thinking they're trying way to hard which also added to the fact that this film just doesnt feel cinematic.

It feels very much like a Lifetime movie.

That isn't to say that the people involved here don't try.  Both Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin are excellent here.  Winslet is especially superb, channeling Adeles bottled misery in a way that feels authentic and heartbreaking, and then slowly breaking her out of her shell, while still keeping hold of the ticks that make it hard for her to interact with the real world around her.  Still, these performances aren't enough to overcome the films weaknesses, especially when certain unnecessary characters come around and stink up the whole joint.

Yes, Im talking about you Brighid Fleming and your terrible character, Eleanor.

It would have been nice if Reitman could have adapted this story in a way that felt more his own, but instead he created a film that could have been directed by any no-name director with no style or knack for storytelling.  It all feels so blandly constructed and obvious, and the sappy ending felt completely unnatural.  I really wanted this to be something special, but instead it came and went and was completely forgotten, for a reason.",1399593600,,4098,4.574759945130316

6152468,4,B00H9LHVHI,"Jason Reitman adapted Joyce Maynard's novel `Labor Day' for the screen and also directed a sterling cast in one of the little motion picture surprises of last year. Now on DVD perhaps this very sensitive and wondrously acted film will achieve a wider audience. It is a love story, simply that - and unfortunately the trailers for the film suggested another kind of `Taken' theme. Wrong.

Adele (Kate Winslet) is in a state of depression since her husband left her for his secretary after she failed to have another live birth to complement their family of three: Henry (a brilliant Gattlin Griffith) is left behind to care for his near agoraphobic mother. The two of hem in shopping for some suitable clothes for school (the weekend is Labor Day weekend in New Hampshire) encounter a wounded man Frank (Josh Brolin) who asked for a ride - to their home. Frank has just escaped prison where he was undergoing an appendectomy and jumped out the window to escape. (Frank was imprisoned for murdering his wife, which was not actually a murder but a tragic set of circumstances surrounding his infant son - a fact we learn through flashbacks). Frank allows Adele to tend to his wound, but reassures both Adele and Henry he has no intention of hurting them - he just needs a place to rest until dark. But gradually Frank endears himself to Henry and to Adele and they become a family despite the police search that is constantly threatening their privacy. The manner in which this all plays out is as sensitive a love story as has been filmed.  Even the ending is not predictable, but it does show the power of trust and love that short Labor Day weekend created.

The supporting cast is rich in character actors and the setting and music and cinematography cannot be faulted. This is a very fine film that deserves wide circulation. Grady Harp, May 14",1399507200,,1846,4.673846153846154

6152537,5,B00H9LHVHI,"""Labor Day"" requires a lot of patience to reap the rewards that aren't apparent from the start of the film.  Henry Wheeler (Gattlin Griffith) lives with his shut-in mother, Adele (Kate Winslet), and has basically assumed the parental function because of her inability to fully function in the maternal role.  While shopping one day in one of the rare times Adele goes out to the public they are kidnapped by an escaped prisoner, Frank Granger (Josh Brolin), and commandeered into taking him to their house to hideout, a ramshackle abode in a sleepy Massachusetts hamlet.  Quickly Frank makes himself handy massaging the feet of a bound Adele and feeding her seductively his homemade chili while she's tied up.  Adele  untethered the two are soon making peach pie erotically kneading the dough in the process.  Shades of Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in ""Ghost""!  I was ready to dismiss this film as a routine chick flick or, worse yet, a cinematic Harlequin romance.  Never fear, though.  We're in the hands of director Jason Reitman who bought us ""Up in the Air"" and the criminally maligned ""Young Adult"".  What Reitman and Winslet are attempting here is very subtle.  Utilizing flashbacks and a highly modulated performance by Winslet it dawns on you that this film is more than a romance but a portrait of a woman in turmoil. Meticulously Winslet charts the progressions of a woman in excruciating emotional pain.  With scant histrionics and few acting ticks Winslet  suggests a woman in crisis due to circumstances in her past.  Her work here is an example of why she is in the top tier of contemporary screen actresses.  Ultimately it's heartbreaking but the film steers itself from the verge of mawkishness on the strength of Winslet's turn.  Brolin is good, too, but this film isn't really about him unless it concerns you whether he committed the murder he was incarcerated for or not.  Ultimately that little nugget is unimportant or inconsequential to the film.  Young Griffith is good in a role that belies his years and he more than holds his own with the older actors.  ""Labor Day"" kind of disappeared from the larger screens when released last Winter probably due to poor or misleading marketing.  If one is looking for complexity in film ""Labor Day"" fills the bill.",1399075200,,2280,4.872727272727273

6152552,2,B00H9LHVHI,"Jason Reitman has a nearly perfect track-record when it comes to the films he has directed. Thank You For Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air, and Young Adult are all multi-layered, thought-provoking, devastatingly funny films with rewatch value.

""Labor Day"" is an old-fashioned melodrama about star-crossed lovers. Adele (Kate Winslet) is depressed. Her husband left her and their son Henry in a nearly catatonic state where she doesnt leave the house more than once a month to shop for household necessities. One day, when Adele and Henry are out shopping, nice-guy convict Frank (Josh Brolin) begs them for a place to stay while the law is hot on his tail.

""Im a lot stronger than you think,"" Adele tells Frank. She isnt. She allows herself to be swept off her feet by this potentially dangerous gentleman who seems too good to be true. Alas, they develop a passionate romance while Henry keeps to himself rooms away.

""Labor Day"" will or will not work for you depending on one factor - if you buy the core romance of the two characters. Franks back-story as well as Adeles are examined in the films rocky third act, and they do add some clarity to these two wayward characters, but that back-story fills in the blank a little later than it should have.

I enjoyed watching Winslet give a quality performance in a melodrama that took itself a little too seriously, played too safe, and is relatively joyless. Labor Day lacks the acid wit that flowed throughout Up in the Air and Young Adult. Those were both dramatic films, but they had strong comedic undertones and were very funny at times.

Based on a novel by Joyce Maynard that I haven't read, there might be a fan base for Labor Day. But I suspect the novel wasn't as dry and formulaic as this film was. If youve seen anything from the Nicholas Sparks canon, youve basically got an idea of what lies in store for the audience in Labor Day. Unless youve really got a thing for star-crossed lover stories, you may be a little bored and find little to like here.

6152588,3,B00H9LHVHI,"""She looks like the kind of person that could help me."" Frank (Brolin) is a convicted murderer who has just escaped from prison and is on the run looking for a place to hide. When he sees Adele (Winslet) and her son at a store he forces them to take him to their house until it's safe for him to leave. What starts off as a way to escape the law also becomes a way for Adele to escape her life and find the one thing she has been missing. So first of all I have to say this is a good movie. That said this is geared way more toward women then I was expecting. It's hard for me to totally get into movies like this mainly because they are so unbelievable. I don't want to give anything away but if you have seen any Nicholas Sparks movie you will know what to expect. I couldn't get past the ""perfect man"" aspect of this. Within a day of showing up at the house the convicted murderer fixes her car, makes dinner and a pie, teaches her son to throw a baseball and allows the paraplegic kid from next door to join in...on the first day! You can pretty much guess how the movie turns out from there. As a heads up this is the most uplifting and inspiring Kate Winslet movie since Revolutionary Road so be prepared for that. This isn't bad but my wife liked this much more then I did. Overall, if you like movies like The Lucky One you will love this. I give it a B but again my wife liked it much more then I did.",1398470400,6,1410,4.00354609929078

6152609,3,B00H9LHVHI,"What I am reviewing is more related to the theme of the film as I found it quite interesting. I am taking the liberty of looking at the roles of the characters from my own perspective rather than the moviemaker's. I see three main characters in this movie- Adele, Frank (escaped convict) and Gerald (ex-husband). Even though the moviemakers may have wanted us to focus more on the first two but I see all 3 of them equally prominent.

Adele is a dreamer. Apparently she did not go along well with her ex-husband, most likely because of her idealistic demands from the relationship; therefore she ends up living an isolated life filled with hardships and lack of protection. Apparently, she takes the legal custody of her son and gives him his share of whatever she chose for herself. The most disturbing thing about her character is the fact that she falls for an escaped convict who has not even talked about his past to her. Interestingly, Frank never reveals to her under what circumstances he gets his sentence, nor does she make any serious attempt to dig into his past but allows herself to be drifted in to a romantic world just because she is impressed by his household chores and man's jobs. What's worse is the fact that she lets her son grow in his company as well and decides to move to another country and live life of an outlaw and chooses the same for her son as well. She doesn't seem to care much about her son's schooling as well. It may look romantic if you are a teenager but it's just so hard to swallow if you are a parent. And, people who think that going to Canada is just like crossing the state line need to know that one cannot cross international border without a passport, and thus without revealing your true identity. That may be actually a flaw in the movie itself.

Frank is an honest man, a victim of circumstance. Wrongfully convicted of something he never did or intended to do. There are many prisoners in the USA who are serving punishments for the crimes they never did. He is a caring guy and brings joy to people around him. He gets his reward at the end of his sentence- company of a woman who he loves.

Gerald is a responsible father and a responsible husband and believer of long lasting relationships. It may seem initially that he is flamboyant because he made an affair with his secretary. But the fact that he ends up marrying her and raising a family with her plus taking care of the children that she brought along with her from her previous marriage, more than clears Gerald's image. He admits to his son that he probably wasn't the `ideal guy' his mother had dreamt of. So he broke up and got in to a more doable relationship. He plays his role as father well. He takes Henry out with the rest of his family every weekend. He is keen to know who his ex-wife is hanging out with for the sake of his son, and is always there for his son at all the milestones of his life. Gerald is more realistic than emotional and is far happier in his not so complicated world than Adele.",1391558400,4,3025,4.4078711985688726

A convict is hiding out at your house but he's outside doing chores? Many moments like this left me unable to suspend belief to fully accept and enjoy the story. Sexual tension falls flat and sappiness ensues. It's a shame to see Brolin's intensity weakened here. Not a terrible movie but it could have been so much better.",1530576000,,441,4.594936708860759

8631244,1,B00H9LHVHI,"It's easy to see why women's romance novels are the number 1 sellers in fiction. This screenplay shrewdly exploits a woman's hidden desire to be dominated by a ""real"" man. Emotionally-wounded but sultry Adele and her doll-faced son, Henry, are commandeered by the roguish, escaped con, Frank. Instead of screaming their heads off like normal people Adele and son willingly chauffeur Frank to their home where he immediately takes charge of the household, especially the kitchen. Bound and fed, the shapely Adele is irrevocably turned on and she and Frank quickly become captor & captive -- with benefits. Though not graphic, this chick flick's cast have sex coming out of their ears, including the pint-sized nymph young Henry encounters at the store and library. About 99% of this movie is harmless, mechanical chick fantasy. But the one scene that truly creeped me out was Adele and Henry reposed in the hammock in which she lays her twist on a 'birds and bees' lecture on Henry. ""How it FEELS"". Thanks, Mom, I'm really glad you shared that with me, now excuse me while I puke. In fact, had this whole deal happened to me when I was Henry's age, I would blabbed to the cops, pocketed the reward and split to join the Coast Guard.

Ladies, keep on believing. Somewhere in Walmart lurks a rakish devil to rescue you from those dull, nice guys that pay the mortgage.

But, if you're even smarter, utilize the plot formula and write your own ""Labor Day"" -- ""bad guy"" rogue scoops up damsel who submits, ""bad guy"" turns out to be not so bad, just a great cook/lover who got a bum rap, live HEA (happy ever after).
