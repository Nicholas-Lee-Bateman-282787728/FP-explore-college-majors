8672109,3,B00MGK1DPI,"This was a fantastic series when it was first aired on BBC back in the 80's and, as expected on BBC, was presented in excellent quality.  So I decided to order this DVD set. What a let down, very disappointing. Very poor quality product and almost as if it had been (probably was) copied from an old VHS tape. There was also no way to contact the sender. Very disappointing and probably the reason it's no longer available.",1521158400,,423,4.423076923076923
8672110,2,B00MGK1DPI,"The content of the impressive series is wonderful. However the DVDs I purchased were appalling reproductions, truly appalling. Foggy, indistinct grainy and at times they stopped working and I had to jump ahead, sometimes minutes. Looked like a copy of a copy of a copy all done on defective machines. I was well and truly ripped off by a defective product. I expected decent quality DVDs.",1492905600,,388,4.893939393939394

8672112,5,B00MGK1DPI,"I saw when it came out. I found it very informative and useful. Used parts of it in presentations to fellow military officers.

Wish I could get it in DVD format. Added to my Wish List and looking for sources. If you know of any, please reply.
