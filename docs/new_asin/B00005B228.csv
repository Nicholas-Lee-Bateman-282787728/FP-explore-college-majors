1420094,3,B00005B228,"My main interest for this DVD was the music of Pink Floyd.
There are several films that have music by them which are hard to get in Europe (VHS was available from the US, but always in the wrong format for European video recorders).
The film itself has wonderful shots of the impressive nature of New Guinea but the story line isn't all that great. Dated is what comes to mind.
The transfer to DVD even has a visible problem after 15 minutes or so into the film (there is a warning about this on the DVD box) which has caused synchronisation problems.
All in all I'm glad to have finally seen this film now, although the soundtrack CD of course is a better representation of the Pink Floyd film score.
Now let's hope 'More"" and 'Zabriskie Point' also appear on DVD.",1046908800,6,765,4.394366197183099
1420095,3,B00005B228,"I first saw LA VALLEE over two decades ago and was haunted by the exotic images and Pink Floyd's score.  Eventually, I molded a memory that in fact was quite different from the actual film. In hindsight, it wouldn't surprise me if that was director Barbet Schroeder's intent.  Certainly the cinematography by Nestor Almendros serves that purpose.
This meandering, mystical and somewhat pretentious hippie trek into the wilds of Borneo to find rare bird feathers is meant to be a journey of self-discovery -- a  cinematic acid trip that may or may not have actual meaning.
Oddly, in the movie, the ""Valley Obscured by Clouds"" (the film's full title) is never reached, but only seen in the distance at fade out.
Pink Floyd's music and the exotic images make it worth the trek.  But beware of seeing this in an altered state hoping to improve the quality of the trip.",1046390400,4,864,4.74
1420096,3,B00005B228,"...coming after the brilliant MEDDLE, this album posed a problem for Floyd... they were tired of being a Euro ""Cult"" band in the US, and needed to start racking up sales-after all 'the '60's' were over with. So it came to pass that OBSCURED BY CLOUDS would be the last 'honest' Floyd LP, though because of the constraints placed on them for an OST, I find it to be a rather lackluster album...but it started their slide from artistic purity to commercial $uccess-yes im talking about every post-pubescent boys wet dream, finally radio friendly to corporate owned FM stations-and still on the charts after 30 years,  the mediocre, but trillion-selling DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...(just because it sells tonnes don't mean its any good) Oh... the film was OK...",1041811200,,754,4.844961240310077

1420098,2,B00005B228,"Watching ""The Valley"" is a tedious chore.  Pink Floyd's soundtrack is wonderful, of course, and was responsible for my desire to see this film.  A collector of rare bird feathers gets hold of a specimen from the ""bird of paradise"" that lives in a valley in New Guinea that is always ""obscured by clouds"" (the name of the Floyd album).  This valley is supposed to be paradise, and its geography is unknown, since no one has ever returned.
Most of the movie consists of the journey to this obscured valley.  Along the way the characters ingest some native tree-sap hallucinogen and watch some indigenous folks slaughter a boar.  They inexplicably carry blankets in a cooler.  They espy the valley in the distance and then the movie ends.
I watched this movie with about six other people, and when the movie was over I was the only person still awake.  My advice is to simply listen to the soundtrack, ingest some native hallucinogen if you are so inclined, and watch your own movie that will be immeasurably more interesting than this.",1002844800,10,1033,4.705555555555556

It was not quite worth the 13 year wait to find a good copy, but it was a pleasure to watch.  If you are buying this as a Floyd enthusiast, buy it.  If you are looking for a good foreign flick, you might wanna check out other movies.  The soundtrack by Pink Floyd is quite good and fittingly placed in the movie.  The best example of this is of the opening credits.  The valley ""Obscured by Clouds"" song leaves a longing for the truth of the valley.  Good movie overall, but it was quite special to hear the Floyd in a different media.  True Floyd fan??  Get it.  If not, don't bother. Hope this helps.",996105600,16,696,4.044117647058823

1420102,2,B00005B228,"I first saw this back in the seventies. I can't remember what I thought of it then but having just seen it for the first time since then, I can sum this up in only two words - boring and pretentious. It is an ""art house"" movie for sure but one whose aspirations extend far too far beyond its reach.
I'm left numb but not comfortably. I was going to say ""it features"" but it doesn't. It just HAS some music by the Pink Floyd. The soundtrack, such as it is, is utterly irrelevant; it might have benefitted from Tangerine Dream or Faust or some such. As it goes, whatever qualities the music has are left far behind as it's barely audible anyway. Even out of context, the music's dull.
Yawn.",1382832000,2,688,4.259541984732825
1420103,3,B00005B228,"Quick rundown on the narrative, as not to sound too repetitive: Rich woman, wife of a diplomat and clothing designer, seeks rare bird feathers and native art. She meets an Aussie man who, along with another man, two women, and a young boy, are seeking a valley (the title) where they will find utopia (I guess). As they move closer to this valley, she begins to sever ties with her social/bourgeoise life, and sheds any material needs. The group is found to be ""hippies"" by her, and she succumbs to their seemingly inane search for ""the valley.""

As I watched this movie, I was reminded of Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" (did I say that?!?!). However, Herzog's movie is cinematic genius; Schroeder lacks the same great narrative ability. The shots and ethnographic footage is similar (meeting natives in foggy landscapes), but Herzog ""became"" the film (if you have seen Les Blank's documentary ""Burden of Dreams,"" then you understand what I am describing). This movie relies too much on toeing a line between being an ethnographic movie and a narrative of the time it was made. I believe it fails in both ways, but not as badly as to render the film absolutely awful. I liked it to a point, taking it in as a ""period piece"" (in the vein of a movie like ""Glen and Randa"" or ""Zabriskie Point"") than for face-value. After all, it is about shedding one's pretentious ways for a greater aim. However, it is a bit long and over-winded.

The music by Pink Floyd seemed more for a gimmick (to sell the movie) than to give a greater level to the narrative. The film is made like a documentary, but most of what happens is not shocking or really all that imaginative. The constant use of Australians using French seems really crazed! Is every ""white"" person in New Guinea Australian who speak fluent French? The movie also ""feels"" like it should have been made some 5 years BEFORE release. By 1972, I tend to believe that this movie would already have seemed dated.

The DVD, by HVE, has some problems. The greatest I found is that there are a couple of scenes in the transfer where one can see the film ""skip."" The filmstrip is noticeable, with sprocket holes and all! Wow. I don't know why.

The ""greens"" of New Guinea, along with the misty mountains (reminiscent of Herzog's ""Aguirre"") are beautiful (obviously, with Nestor Almendros' cinematography). I enjoyed the ethnographic imagery and of rites and dances of the natives. For someone interested in them, this film is worth a look.

3 of 5 Amazon stars. I take 1/2 off for the DVD transfer. It is, nevertheless, an interesting view, but many will probably be bored by some overlong scenes. The movie could truly have been better with 30 or so minutes trimmed.",1368316800,,2719,4.6680584551148225
1420104,3,B00005B228,"Far from the greatest work I've seen.  Not to far from the worst.
I give it a 3 star rating cause I'm a huge Pink Floyd lover.  For me it was a ""must-have; must-see"".  The movie is about a hunt for a valley that is some secret kept by the natives.  A paradise if you will.  Yet when they finally get there at the end of the movie,  you don't get to see it.  Done with the style of say.... ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" with David Bowie.  Difficult to watch with enough sex to keep you watching.  I would recommend the movie to collectors, not those looking for a ""good movie"".

1420108,2,B00005B228,"Thinking back to my initial viewing of La Vallee back in 2004, I was taken by its charm and adventurous journey of discovery. Having seen it again this year, I'm much more critical of its faults.

First of all, the pace is excruciatingly slow. Rather simple scenes drag on forever. A lot of brushing up and editing could have been done to make things move at a more even pace. Secondly, there's a lot of plot points and scenes that don't really make much internal sense. Young, rich, beautiful socialite Viviane decides to just leave her comfortable life and husband because some dorky early 70's hippie is cute and happens to be on a quest? Come on. There's also a drawn-out ""Huh?"" moment when Viviane's rented plane takes off...does a slow bank back around to the runway...and lands again. Hey Viviane, why not just change your mind before you got on it 3 minutes earlier? There's also a completely unnecessary slaughter scene of three pigs. I'm not particularly squeemish, but it seemed a bit over the top. There's also an abundance of nudity and sex; just like most late 60's/early 70's films, it's none too subtle with the ""Hey look! Nudity!"" approach.

Pink Floyd's score work is used sparingly, and never longer than a minute at a time. The album soundtrack is a lot better than the film.

Overall...I like the film's imagery and the themes in the story (loss of innocence, enlightenment, society and laws, the inner journey), but the film is simply too weighted down in 1972 to stand out today. If you saw it on its original run in the 70's and have a soft spot for Floyd and nostalgia, add an extra star to my review.",1243814400,9,1626,4.6

1420111,3,B00005B228,"Obscure by Clouds, the sound track to La Vallee, is much better than the movie itself.  In fact I only remember floyd playing here and there, the soundtrack did not play a big role in the movie.  The scenery in La Vallee was amazing but thats about it.  The plot line was interesting but it was pretty slow going and many scenes seem to drag on.  It ends abruptly before a climax even occurs.  Unlike a different review that was written, I had no trouble turning the subtitles on.  The fact that 90% of the movie is in French was not the turn off for me (although it might bother some) I don't think it's a ""must see"" for hardcore floyd fans like myself.

1420118,3,B00005B228,"Singular story about a woman looking for feathers and an expedition of people looking for paradise in a valley which is not drawn on the map. So, they suppose paradise must be there, obscured by clouds. A hippy philosophy but with a touch of scepticism. A picture of the late 70's with a beautiful photography by Nestor Almendros.",1147219200,4,330,4.706896551724138
1420119,5,B00005B228,"It's not easy to do justice to La Vallee in a few sentences.  It weaves adventure, anthropology, social criticism, nature, and relationships into a parable of self-revelation.  The film focuses on Viviane, one of the beautiful people who know all good things except heart-felt passion.  Literally by accident, her fascination with exotic feathers draws her into an expedition with a ""family"" of utopian idealists.  As they cross New Guinea in search of an isolated valley, Viviane simultaneously experiences a joyful odyssey across her suppressed inner landscapes.  Sumptuously filmed events interlaced with moments of self-revelation transform Viviane from a pampered woman of the world to an impassioned child of nature, and beyond.  Each character influences her personal quest differently: pragmatic enlightenment (Olivier), universal love (Hermine), visionary fanaticism (Gataen), oneness with nature (native tribe).
Outer and inner realities begin to merge, eventually reflecting and enhancing each other in mystical parallelism. She becomes possessed by a sense of seamless unity between her self and her environment. Feeling herself flow into the world around her is a joyful reward that richly compensates for forfeiting every accoutrement of civilization.
Anyone expecting to see them giggling merrily over tropical drinks in a valley of palm trees and friendly monkeys is in for a rude shock. This is an honest film. Our little self-styled cult of postmodern zealots knows the price of following the inner path and they have prepared themselves to pay it fully.  We do see their valley though we may not readily recognize it as paradise.  The Valley obscured by clouds is the ultimate parallel symbol in this film of symbols: it is the undiscovered depths of ones being, and an enabling realm of detachment totally cut off from self-alienating civilizations. La Vallee marks a path by which one aspires to universal harmony through unfettered spiritual freedom.

Schroeder uses varying combinations of sound and picture as an expressive tool.  As the story progresses, he steadily diminishes emphasis on words while increasing the importance of images.  Conversations in rather bland settings dominate the first part of the film (excepting some rapt moments under the seductive spell of magic feathers).  Gradually, visual elements gain prominence.  The final scene is in the style of silent film, with only sparse dialogue inserted like a few lines of printed text in a Chaplin movie.  Our experience of this shift from word-biased content to image-biased content is also Viviane's experience as she gradually reaches into parts of herself that are beyond words.  This structural analogy lets us join her inner transformation through our eyes and ears, thus making the abstract seem real.  It also unifies style and substance in a way that contributes handsomely to the film's focus and intensity.  Every aspect of this film was created solely by movie professionals.  La Vallee is an impressive example of the unique potential of their craft.

Those who would turn to this film mostly to hear Pink Floyd's music should buy the CD instead.  Three years later Pink Floyd released Wish You Were Here which has a similar theme.",1142899200,3,3236,5.345167652859961
1420120,4,B00005B228,"I've always liked the alternative mood music that Pink Floyd

produced in the early years and this film with its lush surroundings and sensual scenes in french (with subtitles) is a perfect sensory match.  It is intriguing to see the native people

of that time and to fit them into the story really made the film

realistic.  Vivian has a magnetic beauty that makes the film one you can enjoy more than once. I was disturbed about the still on

the back cover also as another reviewer noticed,that it is not in the movie since it looks like an important scene. Nevertheless

the film is a real treasure- sort of a flashback to a more open society and the dilemmas they faced.",1140652800,,676,4.491803278688525
1420121,4,B00005B228,"Great movie.

Poor DVD.

Watching this movie, you really want to hear a director commentary or an interview or something discussing the motivations and the techniques behind this movie.

What's more (no pun intended), scenes have been delted.  I'm not saying that I remember scenes from drug fogged days when I might have seen this film in an art house someplace, I'm saying that there is a still on the back of the DVD from a scene that does not appear in the film itself.

But these Frustrations aside, La Vallee is a beautiful film capturing a truly fantastic jounrey that you are forced to believe the filmmakers must have actually ventured through to get the film that you are watching.

The Tribal people in the film are the real deal.  And when a tribal elder calls out at a ceremony that he is proud to host these white visitors, you get the impression that he's talking about the film makers themselves, not the characters in the movie.  But it hardly matters.

The story is one that could have only been put on film in the 70's and it is truly a beautiful concept for a story.

Schroeder was inspired by a moment in the film more when a character discusses that the human brain is largely uncharted and unknown, but in those uncharted areas lie the keys to humanity.

Similarly New Guineau was unknown and unexplored... and so a group of intrepid hippies attempts to discover paradise beneath the clouds that obscure it from plain sight.

It's a not so subtle metaphor for the spiritual journey on which his main character, Vivian is embarking... and that's not a knock.  Vivian is a character who is well aware of her subtext and even of the metaphorical significance of her physical journey as it relates to her emotional journey.

There is some clunky dialogue and an unsettlingly abrupt ending leaves one wanting more (no pun intended).

The Floyd soundtrack lives on as one of Pink Floyd's best ""pop"" records, but it is sadly underutilized in this film.

Normally these three faults would be a problem, but it's so enjoyable to see a film like this, it hardly matters.

Enjoy the journey.",1137110400,9,2103,4.640540540540541
1420122,3,B00005B228,"This movie gets 3 stars only because of the acting, filmwork, and music. But the storyline is uneventful and doesn't go anywhere. It's really not that trippy or amazing.

1420123,5,B00005B228,"Opening scene: Vivian, a diplomats wife, is browsing through the artifacts offered for sale in a grass hut in New Guinea. Vivian is seeking some rare feathers that fetch huge sums at Parisian Boutiques. She is a socialite and yet she is also very comfortable in the very earthy surroundings she finds herself in while her husband is away on business. At first hers seems only a casual curiousity but then in walks a tall blonde hippie stranger who has just returned from the interior with a cache of rare feathers -- after that it is not only feathers she is interested in but the tall blonde stranger as well.
Vivian catches a ride with the stranger and accompanies him back to his camp site. As soon as the two enter the tent they see a couple laying naked together. Vivian is surprised and yet also turned on by these very relaxed living conditions. The hippies live very close to the earth and they want to get even closer. In this very sensually open atmosphere the blonde stranger shows Vivian where they intend to go -- it is a place which has no name because it has never been charted as it is invisible from the sky as it is perpetually obscured by clouds. To the hippies this last unmarked place represents a last promise of paradise. Vivian is skeptical of such notions but she cannot resist the heady atmosphere of dreaminess and sensual freedom that this group represents to her and so she decides to leave her socialite existence for awhile and accompany them to La Vallee.
The story is very simple and Barbet Schroeder's style is almost documentary simple --  Schroeder produced some of the early new wave films but his own films are nothing like those early 1960's films. More and La Vallee do not draw attention to the director as the new wave films did, Schroeders films concentrate on the vagaries of character and what different experiences feels like. The Pink Floyd soundtrack does more than the dialogue in giving us access to what these characters are going through. Though they are united in their search for paradise, each character is also on a very private journey and  the music accents both the shared and private aspects of this cross country quest.
One of the most memorable sequences is when the group spends the day with several tribes of New Guinea bushmen who have gathered to recognize their ancestors. Two of the hippies dress in tribal attire and paint themselves and dance along with the tribesman but two do not. Vivian herself does not adorn herself but merely watches the goings-on from a comfortable distance like a journalist  while the tall blonde stranger feels a deep depression that he unlike the tribesman will never feel at one with nature.  At another point Vivian too will attempt to merge with nature with the help of a hallucinogen but it is only a momentary  union.  And so the film is dreamy and yet also it is a kind of lament that certain dreams will never be more than dreams.
Along with the subtle but perfect mood music by Pink Floyd the cinematography is absolutely exquisite -- New Guinea has never looked so good.
I like both More and La Vallee equally well.  And yes Michelangelo Antonio's Zabriskie Point is also very good and also features Pink Floyd as well as the Grateful Dead. I think Barbet Schroeder's films are much more organic though and so more pleasing to the instincts than Antonioni's film. Antonioni is very intellectual and even when he gets organic he arrives there by intellectual routes.  Herzogs Aguirre is excellent and it is similar in that it is also a search for a mythic paradise but its vision of nature and man is much harsher.  Theres a lyric magic in Barbet Schroeders films that simply does not exist anywhere else.",1073606400,26,3712,4.654961832061069

She goes in search of a rare birds exotic and very beautiful feathers, and very illegal too.

However, Vivian is warned that they may not come back...  Together they meet many different tribesman, mudmen, birdmen..you get the point.  They also don't seem to give a damn about commiting adultry...  After a long journey into the rain forest, they all get discouraged, tired, and hungry.  One man says, if you listen towards the end of the film, ""Ya know, we're never going to make it there.""  The other man replies, ""we must keep going.""  Now, you never actually see this valley, but right at the end of the film, Vivan says while pointing, ""There it is, I see it.""  -Fin-  Yeah, and we never really know if they are all just delirious or high, or really there...

1420125,4,B00005B228,"I saw THE VALLEY (Obscured By Clouds) in a theater in the 70s, though probably not on its first-run engagement. What I remember is the imagry, not the music (in hindsight I'm startled Pink Floyd supplied the mostly subtle score), and an awe for the film and an appreciation for the night on walking out of the theater. I remember the ad campaign, but it was a word-of-mouth hit -- ""You HAVE to see this movie!""
Much of the content is dated to its times, but a surprising portion is not. Remember, too, that the term ""hippie"" was itself getting dated in 1972, the pursuit of personal pleasures rising, as one bit of dialogue touches on.
The DVD transfer is imperfect, but artifacts are not obtrusive. Some of the editing is abrupt, again not detracting from the whole. The film is largely in French with some English and native New Guinean; English subtitles are available, but only accessible by pressing the Subtitles button on the player or remote.

At the time, central Papua New Guinea was unexplored and unmapped by Westerners, the mountains and valleys of the center of the island under eternal cloud cover (Obscured by Clouds), invisible even from the air, and surrounded by dense jungle; a place of shadows which terrified even the hardy jungle natives of the interior.

The movie is slow-going and if you are bored by subtlety, slow-pacing, and lack of action, then this might not be the movie for you--it is very long too for the minimal action (and dialogue). Some of the subject matter is dated--free-love, ever-shifting interpersonal dynamics, and an underlying ennui are very sixties--although this is part of its charm also. BUT ...

The cinematography is gorgeous, the atmospherics subtly beautiful and terrifying (like some of the soundtrack by the Pink Floyd), and there is actual footage of the first ever encounters between Westerners and native tribes of the interior, footage that must be of interest to anthropologists even today--it documents one of the very few last places on earth unexplored and uninfluenced by Westerners.

The cast is excellent--Bulle Ogier, who is well-known in her native France and still acting today, married to Barbet Schroeder, the director of the film; Michael Gothard, who sadly died far too young by suicide in 1992, famous for his performances in For Your Eyes Only, Arthur of the Britons, and another of my own favorites, 1968's Up the Junction; and Miquette Giraudy (in the movie by her stage-name as Monique Giraudy), perhaps best known to the Anglo-American world for her partnership with Steve Hillage in the band Gong and now System 7.

The themes of life and death, and the search for meaning and paradise on Earth are timeless. In many ways, this movie and the film More form a pair--both concern themselves with the search for meaning and a paradise, albeit by very different means, and the dangers and beauty inherent in that search. However, More is focalized through the male experience of woman-as-Other, whereas although la Valle wavers in focalization, some of it is through the eyes of a cynical and bored upper-class French woman, played by Bull Ogier.

It is worth persevering through the slow pace for the final 30 seconds or so of the film, which are utterly shocking and essential to the meaning. Don't zone out towards the end only to miss the final few moments--without them, the movie makes little sense. The extended slow action provides time to bond with the subtly drawn characters and forms an essential contrast to the last few moments.
