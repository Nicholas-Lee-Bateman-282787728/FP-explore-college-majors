1779075,5,B00006IX6K,"I love yoga, do it daily and the practices on this dvd are perfect for my needs.  The music and scenery are relaxing also.  I look forward to my sessions with Suzanne!",1400284800,,167,4.1875
1779076,5,B00006IX6K,"This is a good video but is DEFINITELY not for beginners!  PLEASE buy something that is either titled ""For Beginners"" or try her ""Yoga for Weight Loss"" video.  OK, it's not for weight loss (I think they just slapped those words on it to try to sell more units), but it's an excellent workout because she has people behind her demo'ing beginner and intermediate versions of the postures and she tells you how to adjust for your level.

This IS a good video for true intermediate to advanced practitioners but be sure you're warmed up before you start.",1390867200,3,550,4.591836734693878
1779077,4,B00006IX6K,"This is a good practice for those days when you want a gentle practice with lots of stretching.  The pace is slow (although other reviewers are correct that she doesn't hold any one pose very long).  In spite of the fact that the poses are basic, I find the pace and something about Suzanne Deason's soothing voice makes me really focus on doing each one as mindfully and accurately as I can.  I particularly enjoy the balance section.  There's a bonus section for ""that time of the month"" which is too gentle for me, but might be helpful for those who have a lot of discomfort at that time.",1384214400,,591,4.394495412844036

1779079,5,B00006IX6K,"I love this DVD. It has a wonderful teacher, Suzanne Deason, and has Maui as it's backdrop. Although the teacher expects you to know basic yoga postures, it's still perfect for beginners to ""pause"" through and learn the postures. Ms. Deason offers plenty of modifications for those learning or tight, but I find the DVD perfect for beginner/intermediate daily practice and relaxation. I don't care for the flaccid flute music in the background so I play other meditation music and turn down the sound.",1379376000,,501,4.976190476190476
1779080,5,B00006IX6K,"This was one of my first home practices and originally, I bought it on VHS! I've recently replaced it on DVD.  It's well-rounded and not too simple nor too difficult of a routine to follow.  This makes the perfect addition to anyone's home yoga practice library.",1376006400,,262,4.673913043478261
1779081,5,B00006IX6K,"I love Suzanne's products for calming my nerves and stretching. If you're looking for an intense yoga workout, this isn't the one, but if you want something to stretch and give you a general sense of well being, definitely check this out!",1374364800,3,238,4.690476190476191

1779084,5,B00006IX6K,"This yoga dvd is absolutely brilliant..... I highly recommend it for anyone wanting / needing a good stretch of upper body. I did this routine daily for a year after a head injury & it was the only thing that sorted out the headaches I was getting.......because the focus is so much on stretching the upper body...Suzanne's voice is very soothing & the wording is lovely which leads to a really relaxing yoga session. Another good thing about it is Ive kept doing the routine day after day & never bore of it... inspired by the flexibility of Suzanne I keep finding more in the sessions.... Thank you Suzanne...this is a beautiful peace of work.

1779085,5,B00006IX6K,"I really enjoyed this video!  I love Suzanne Deason's other videos and had been thinking about purchasing this one for a while.  I finally broke down and got it and have not been disappointed!  It is not a good video for a beginner because they don't describe the poses or motifications, but it is good for someone that is moving out of the beginner phase and into the intermediate phase.  It leaves me feeling stronger and more relaxed and has all of the poses that I want to work on and master.  I recommend this to anyone that wants to expand their practice.",1300924800,,561,4.407766990291262
1779086,3,B00006IX6K,"I use a variety of yoga and pilates DVDs, this one is not my favorite but not my least favorite either.  I think its probably best for beginners as it guides through breathing exercises.  I found the actual poses easy to do and didn't work up a sweat.  I do like her voice and the fact that she doesn't say a bunch of unnecessary things.  This is a good practice for when I am under the weather or have overdone it the day before.",1257811200,,430,4.083333333333333
1779087,5,B00006IX6K,"I have purchased the 2006 publication of Yoga Conditioning for Women which I believe is just a remake of this 2002 publication.

I love the 20-minute practice for stress and fatigue which is a all on the floor practice with long held poses and very Yin-like. I love using it as a early morning yoga and you can add your own meditation and prana/breath-work afterward.

The main practice is 60-minutes and I love it too. It is quite challenging and you should preview the pose guide if you are a beginner to yoga.",1251504000,2,512,4.494623655913978
1779088,5,B00006IX6K,"I tried to do this video quite a while ago when I was first attempting to learn yoga at home, and was defeated by the speed and difficulty of the ""posture"" section.  (The program is in 3 parts:  Breath, which seems easy but really makes you learn to use breath, Posture, a fast moving flowing and balance oriented section, and Centering, which is a lot of twisting and stretching with breath.)  However, now that I feel more confident -- I think I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate level -- I just love this program.  I am still not flexible enough to do all the moves but the grace and beauty of the program entrances me.  And I always feel calm, centered, stretched and balanced when I finish.  I do recommend this for any woman.  Stay with it and enjoy how your performance improves over time.",1235433600,5,808,4.531034482758621
1779089,5,B00006IX6K,"This yoga is probably not a video for the basic basic beginner but for someone who has a cursory introduction to yoga and is of average fitness it's perfect. If you're looking for a nice stretch, I highly recomend it. The pace is good - not too slow, not too fast. The only downside I could see is for someone with a time crunch - the routine is an hour. In the end I think if you have the time to do it regularly you definitely feel and see results in body tone.",1235174400,2,463,3.989247311827957
1779090,5,B00006IX6K,I started exercising recently and got bored with just walking so I thought I would try Yoga. I did a lot of research on the DVD's and instructors before I bought this DVD. Her instruction and pace is wonderful for a beginner like me.  I now have other DVD's of Ms. Deason's that I am going to try.,1224979200,,297,4.120689655172414
1779091,2,B00006IX6K,"I'm updating my review on this one, after pulling it out for the first time in a few years.  This used to be one of my favorite DVDs, however I don't really enjoy it much now.

Knowing more about yoga and being more physically fit now, I find that the poses in the ""Posture"" section of the practice are challenging, but the flow of the practice in general is slow and a bit choppy.  Meaning that she doesn't build and maintain heat in the body.  If you are looking for a vinyasa flow, which I like, this really isn't it.  There are no downward dogs in between poses.  She doesn't move between poses in a fluid motion.  She usually stops and tells you to put your hands on your belly, rather than going into a more active resting pose like standing forward bend or downward dog.

I think what bothers me most is that in the last section, she will do restorative poses and then more active ones, then restorative ones again.  It doesn't feel right.  My body tries to cool down and relax, then she suddenly wants me to do a demanding abdominal pose, then cool down and relax again.

So my overall opinion is it could be great, because it's a great intermediate dvd and the setting is beautiful.  And I also do use muscles that I don't use in other programs.  But it just doesn't seem to flow correctly (where you warm the body, do active poses, maintain heat, and cool down with restorative poses).  But what I do like is that there are many standing poses that don't find in other videos.",1216857600,6,1486,4.336956521739131
1779092,3,B00006IX6K,"The landscaping is beautiful, Suzanne Deason has a soft voice while narrating, but I couldn't get into it.
There is not enough instruction, for beginners, there's no mention how the back foot should be & the only instruction is mainly, ""step the foot forward, put the arm to the side..."" basic body positioning. I like more inspiring visualizations like Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Shiva Rea, Max Strom, Wai Lana who are more in touch with their bodies.
There are some great moves like eagle & half moon & she spends the first 10 min on just breathing, but I still was bored & could not relax like i can with the above teachers.  She also moved pretty fast considering it wasn't a flowing vinyasa type, you get in the pose, barely a breath & you're out. Her teaching also did not focus on the breath, she'd sometimes not mention when to inhale/exhale or say it quickly as an afterthought.
The bonus is more instruction on how to do the poses & a 20 min very relaxed, very easy, light session using a chair & bolsters.

1779093,2,B00006IX6K,"I just started doing yoga about a month ago, and the VHS version of this workout is not what I was looking for. The instructor goes much too fast and there is no explanation of the poses. I couldn't get myself into the poses fast enough, and it wasn't at all the relaxing, stretching workout I was hoping for. I also found the instructor a little annoying. The words she used were too Earth Mothery and hippie dippie for me. I am a young, modern woman, and I just want to increase my flexibility, not align my energy flow/chi/chakras/whatever is the latest fad.",1187136000,2,561,4.456310679611651
1779094,5,B00006IX6K,"I have Suzanne's Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss DVD and it is my absolute favorite. I just got this one and I know that it will also be a favorite that is used regularly. As for the previous review stating that she goes to fast...absolutely not true. What I love about this is she holds the poses a little longer that some other ""flow yoga"" dvd's. What I think the reviewer was referring to was Suzanne's continued instruction throught the session as to when to breathe and move into the next position. A feature I absolutely love. Once you become familiar with the workout and you don't need to constantly look at the tv you can do the whole session by just listening to her instruction which is very relaxing. I can do her weight loss dvd with my eyes shut thanks to her excellent cueing. This is the perfect introduction to the flowing yoga style or power yoga!",1164758400,11,867,4.459119496855346
1779101,5,B00006IX6K,"I have been a Yoga devotee for about a year and a half and have been practising with a series of one hour sessions I downloaded from the Internet. I was bored with the same old, same old so rented Suzanne's DVD from the local video store. I was so impressed with the programme that I kept the DVD on hire for 2 months until I could get my own copy.

Suzanne's routine is still basic enough for near beginners while containing some more challenging moves for those who are a little more advanced. Be careful - don't overdo it and pull a muscle!",1153094400,2,543,4.221153846153846
1779102,3,B00006IX6K,"""A Viewer"" was dead-on.  I have some comments as well...

I don't think I've ever felt as rushed as I did in this video.  No sooner do you hit a pose and you're out and to the next.

Two ways to view this: first, it's a library of poses you can learn and then do on your own time.  Second, it's just too fast *if* you like to really sink into a pose which takes some time.

If I were at Yoga boot camp and Ms. Deason was my drill, this is what I would imagine.  A very soft, pleasent voice, telling me a new instruction every 3 seconds (literally).  For this reason I found the video frustrating.  Not a bad video, not much new-age vernacular, but just rushed.

I've been doing Yoga for a few years and am probably late beginner, early intermediate.",1133308800,18,749,4.138888888888889
1779103,4,B00006IX6K,"Yoga Conditioning for Women is filmed by a beautiful Hawaiian oceanside, with Suzanne alone.  She cues in voice over in a calm and soothing voice, and the music is soft and pleasant.  The practice is a good one, focusing on the feminine aspects of yoga.

The first section on breath is wonderful and gentle.  It has gentle lower body conditioning practices.  The next section, postures, was challenging for me, in the sense that it requires of good balance on one leg (eagle pose, tree pose, half-moon pose, dancer pose, warrior III pose) and the yoga practice flows swiftly.  If you are more experienced with yoga and can change poses quickly and efficiently, you'll really enjoy this practice.  If you're like me and you're not quite that experienced, you'll get frustrated.

The last section, centering, is relaxation and is nice and calming.  It has focuses on the core with twists, backbends and abdominal strengthening poses.

At the end of the practice, Suzanne includes a section that instructs on modification (with yoga strap and block) for some of the more difficult poses.",1131235200,14,1084,4.972222222222222
1779104,4,B00006IX6K,"i really love this dvd.  i first started yoga a year ago with suzanne's yoga for weight loss.  since i have purchased many yoga dvd sessions.  i find myself always returning to this one.  it combines a great practice with relaxation.  if you are looking to sweat like power yoga this won't work for you, but i find it does get my heart rate up at points while relaxing me at the same time.",1087603200,14,389,4.202702702702703
1779105,5,B00006IX6K,"Although I am new to yoga, I found this video to be very helpful and informative. It was very challenging, but I found the instruction to be thorough. Some parts were a little quick, but you soon get the hang of it. This video definitely gives a great workout without the feeling of exhaustion. The scenery is quite nice and the mood is very relaxing. By the time the video was over, I felt relaxed. And also, I felt great!",1068768000,2,423,4.3
1779106,2,B00006IX6K,"Although I really liked the poses that were chosen, she went so fast I could barely find my way into each pose. In my opinion this negates the unique benefits of yoga, which include gradual stretch, sustained strength, and increased body awareness. How can you learn from the poses when you barely have time to greet them?
There is one occassion that might call for this DVD: when you know you should get some exercise, but you really aren't feeling motivated. Because it goes by fast, it's easier to talk yourself into putting on this DVD instead of a more sustained practice.
 If you want a more thorough workout and are familiar with basic poses, I recomment Shiva Rea's Yoga Sanctuary. It is an audio CD but includes a poster with all the poses from the program.",1061337600,9,766,4.591240875912408
1779107,4,B00006IX6K,"This is a challenging workout, particularly the standing poses. Definitely not for beginners since some of the poses require some basic knowledge, which is not always given. If you've been doing yoga for a while, and know all the intricate details of Triangle pose, Warrior pose, etc, then this is the DVD for you. Otherwise, if you want to take the challenge, watch the section for using props (at the end of the workout) before starting. For those of us who are students of the Iyengar tradition, I recommend keeping the pause button near by so that you can get yourself into each pose before she moves on to the next. I found the sequence from pose to pose to be rather quick, but by pausing, I could get into each pose in my own time.
Overall, a challenging but pleasant session.",1059868800,10,783,4.52112676056338
1779108,4,B00006IX6K,"Like many of those who reviewed the VHS version of this tape, i have Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss and really enjoy it.  i was looking forward to a new routine so i could vary my practice and not get bored-however, this is not exactly what i expected  It has only basic instructions on how to get into the poses, and took a couple viewings before i actually tried it.  The program is described as ""fluid and dance-like"" and it is-you don't hold a pose for long, which is a change from other tapes i have seen. As always, the settings are stunning and the scenery beautiful.
  i think the tape is good, don't get me wrong, but it is not so much for a beginner, and is going to take me a lot longer to be able to do the poses.  It's not only an issue of being as amazingly flexible as Ms Deason, but also having some pretty fantastic balance.  i do miss the ""personal instructor"" feature that YCforWL has, and it would be nice if they showed a more useful modification options (i loved that feature in the other program!) but it's not a fatal flaw, if you ask me.  If nothing else, this tape will keep my interest for a while as i try gamely to contort myself gracefully into all kinds of strange positions without falling over on my ... (or face) too often.  Hey, at least my cat will be amused.
The chapter feature is useful and easy to use-the main reason i prefer DVDs to VHS, and the ""Monthly Practice"" thing in the special features section looks pretty cool.
i would almost say this tape would be perfect for someone who has taken a class and gotten the basics down, and is looking for a new routine to do at home.",1047513600,44,1622,4.240259740259741

7969811,5,B00006IX6K,"I love this yoga DVD, contrary to what some other people have said.  At first, I felt rushed through the positions, which are challenging.  However, lately I have been using this DVD several times a week.  The more I do it, the more I love it.  I have gotten to where I know the DVD so well that I have the sequence memorized.  Suzanne always gives me the exact tips that I need.  She seems to know when I'm starting to hold my breath and need to let it go.  To enjoy this DVD, you should already know the basic positions, since she does not spend time explaining how to get into them. For a person with a little experience in yoga, this can be an extremely enjoyable workout.  My one critique is that I would enjoy spending more time with many of the poses.  Since I have it memorized, I do exactly that - I go out on my back yard (weather permitting) without the DVD and do it at my own pace to the accompaniment of the birds.  I will give the sequence of standing and seated poses (the third and fourth parts of the video) for those who might like to try it on their own or for those who just want to get an idea of what Suzanne will be putting them through:
