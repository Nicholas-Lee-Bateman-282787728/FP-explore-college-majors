2414142,5,B000BD1L9U,"This is one of the best documentary films out right now period. This is exactly as it describes, an INTENSE look inside the Roy Jones Jr. camp in preparation for his rematch with Antonio Tarver. You are in camp with Roy Jones for the last 3 weeks leading up to May 15th, then you follow the team to Las Vegas and get an inside look at the locker room preparations before a big Las Vegas fight. There was so much hype surrounding this fight and you will get inside the mind of one of the greatest fighters in history as he prepares for battle. I recommend this film to any sports fan or fan of documentary films. Excellent movie!",1151366400,4,628,4.285714285714286

8085452,1,B000BD1L9U,"Theres almost nothing of roy jones jr in this Dvd.
The Dvd is some old guy with his ridiculous training program, with roy jones jr loosing at the end....
I bought this video to be inspired watching roy jones jr but got none of that... just a skinny old man jumping around doing strange excercises...",1312243200,3,299,4.454545454545454
8085453,4,B000BD1L9U,"IM A HUGE ROY JONES FAN, I REALLY CANT LOOK PAST ROY JONES JR WHEN IT COMES OT BOXING I LOVE THIS VIDEO IT HAS SOME GOOD INFO ON ROY JONES JR. AND I LIKE TO SEE THE WAY HE TRAINS!",1293840000,,179,3.3902439024390243
8085454,2,B000BD1L9U,"My guess, this project was supposed to be something good, but the production company dropped the ball when Jones lost.

It's like taking something of quality, a diamond ring or an Italian suit, and wrapping it in the newspaper that lined your rabbit cage. Jones is a great talent, regardless of his recent problems. Mackie Shilstone is an intelligent and informed conditioning coach. But this was so poorly produced you'd never know either of them had a decent resume.

Poorly edited. If this is to promote Jones( and we assume it is since people keep saying how great Jones is and there was no real series exploration of his character) who in the world chose the clips? We have a clip of Jones arrogantly saying he thought nothing of the fight, when we all know he was knocked out!

The workout stuff is OK. Nothing groundbreaking. But again, poorly directed and edited. See, we brought in a hot girl! Big deal. She's never introduced and we never see her face. Mackie flails wildly to inject some excitement into this part, but he is not supported by the poor production values, slipshod editing( see! we changed camera angles for no reason!) and poor direction.

It's sad to see a talent like Jones fall and it is equally sad to see that him and Shilstone attached to something like this.",1271376000,,1291,4.649122807017544
8085455,1,B000BD1L9U,"I haver never written a review before, even though I have been disappointed in the past.  I am doing so now because not only was the product ad a little misleading, but so were the other reviews and I can't let them mislead anyone else.  First 20 min is a promotional video of one of Roy's training cadre doing very simple exercises and giving basic advise.  There are short peaks of Roy participating, so it sells the video and we are left thinking rubber band training will make you a champ.  This 20 min intro must have been a favor to the trainer from Roy.  (One of his gems was to stay that being hydrated is important... nice.  Any other video of Roy working out will be in short bursts and in very low intensity... a minute of sparring, an exercise in a weight room, and the same eccentric old trainer mumbling things to Roy while hopping around.  Perhaps the most interesting part to me was that Roy had this sort of personality in his ear regularly (though it should be known that this trainer is much sought after from athletes in all realms.. you just won't learn much from him in this video).  And the last portion is as advertised, the buildup to the fight itself.  The hype, Vegas promos, interviews etc.  This was mildly entertaining as it was interspersed with clips of older Roy fights.  We also hear a lot from his camp about how great he is and how Billy Crystal can't wait to see him win... this fight is sure to be a slaughter in Roy's favor.  Then it gets to the fight, they show him and Tarver dance a little, then fade to black with words on the screen that say ""in a surprise upset, Roy was knocked out in the second round"".  I already knew this, but it couldn't even be shown in the video?  Are boxing copyrights that bad?  Man it was anti-climactic.  I am a huge Roy fan, but if you want to watch anything of substance with him in it, just you tube his greatest hits or workouts... this was a waste of money.  At least now the rest of you all know what you will be buying.",1269129600,13,1999,4.259946949602122
8085456,2,B000BD1L9U,I was expecting to see roy jones doing crazy boxing/conditioning drills. I was let down. He is trained by some high pitched guy who is very distracting and does not motivate at all. The video quality/production value is pretty poor too. The only reason I give it two stars is for RJJ. He is the man.,1263513600,,299,4.357142857142857
8085457,4,B000BD1L9U,"When guys walk into the club and say they want to box they are pretty surprised when they find out they have to be in shape just to hit the bag (19 out of 20 times they usually aren't).  A lot of questions/statements you get are: ""I thought I was going to learn how to box?"", ""Boxers don't do this!"", ""When am I going to fight someone!"" etc.  If you are one of these guys get this video.  THIS is what it takes to be a boxer, whether it be amatuer or pro.  When you walk into a club and your wondering why the fighters are doing all these ""low drag, high speed"" exercises and not necessarily hitting a bag the whole time, just remember this video.",1227312000,8,647,4.070866141732283
8085458,5,B000BD1L9U,"This video is an excellent documentary that shows the other side of boxing that we don't usually see, the intense training. Roy Jones Jr. is one of the toughest men on the planet and you can see why here. The man has drive, determination, and unyielding focus. Mackie Shilstone is regarded as one of the best personal fitness experts out there, and from this video, you can see why. He gets in there and does the same training that Roy Jones Jr. is doing, Shilstone leads by example. The bonus workout is good as well, very little equipment needed for an explosive workout.",1201392000,3,573,4.572815533980583
