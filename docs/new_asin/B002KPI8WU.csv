4690687,1,B002KPI8WU,"Horno you didn't!  Combining the two scummiest, bottom-of-the-barrel genres of the moviemaking industry sounds like the most brilliant plan ever conceived.  Sex and murder, two things that most of the targeted audience will never actually experience firsthand(well, at least the former).  This had the possibility of opening the floodgates for an incredible revolutionary movement in film.

Horno ends up being the most terrible of all jokes.

The concept was simple but excellent.  An adult film company decides to make a porno horror film.  The results should have been beautiful.  Throw in some bad drugs that turn the crew into cruddy zombies of some sort, along with some actresses that prefer to keep their clothes on, and you have a complete waste of time.

Really, you will see more blood underneath a bandaid.
You will see better acting in an elementary school play.
You will see more sex scenes in the basement of a church(sorry bad comparison).

Seriously though, this movie is 65 minutes long and has only about 3 minutes of topless chicks, if that.  Unforgivable!  This is a movie about the porn industry, I am not asking for too much.  The main star has a large rubber member protruding through the opening of his pants, but none of the ladies will go near it.  Some of the scenes jump around sporadically.  There are few murders, little blood, and bad gore effects.  And a quick, ten second sex scene that was very unspectacular.

If a Troma film starts to look like an epic James Cameron project in comparison, you know it's bad.  Horno is a clever marketing gimmick that fails miserably in all attempts at delivering what it promises.  Yes, I got punk'd.",1287619200,28,1671,4.840989399293286
4690688,5,B002KPI8WU,"Make no mistake about it: this is a crude film that many individuals will disapprove of (particularly hard-core religious folks and bulldog feminist), however if you have a sense of humor and are not too HUNG up on yourself and your beliefs you won't be able to stop laughing. There is a barrage of sexual references here and enough gore are on display to satisfy most exploitation film lovers palettes.

It deals with a well intentioned porn director trying to make a low-budget zombie film about a zombie outbreak spread by sodomy. Need I say more? It makes fun of the porno industry specifically and low-budget horror in general. I enjoyed Williams last film The Hood Has Eyez, and this picture did not let me down. However, they are two very different monsters altogether. This is what One Eyed Monster could have been. AGAIN, this picture obviously won't be for everyone. Those who are thin-skinned enough to be offended by stuff like The Hood Has Eyez and exploitation films in general, and those really hung up on religion should avoid this one like the plague.

But if you like boobies, coochies, blood and downright hilarious lewdness, this one's for you. A must for B-movie lovers!",1250899200,3,1191,4.804878048780488

8471709,1,B002KPI8WU,Movie in a movie concept is boring. This movie should not be about a director. It should be more boobs and gore and horrors. My 8 bucks was wasted,1458432000,,146,4.068965517241379
8471710,1,B002KPI8WU,I would give this more stars but being a bad movie is its main distinction. It could actually get an academy award for the best drama in which the cast of a porno film production starts turning into zombies.,1435968000,,207,4.333333333333333

8471712,1,B002KPI8WU,"When you rent or go out to the movies, your one basic reason is to be entertained. You want to have a good time, and you want to be able to feel that it was time and money well spent. Every once in a while though you find a film that is so bad, so boring, and so idiotic on every level that you make it your mission to tell everyone you know to stay far, far away from it. To spare them the money and time that you wasted in agony on it. Horno is one of those films. This film is so bad, that if you see it, you might remember it longer than your favorite film simply because if someone ever mentions it, you want to be ready to warn them to stay far away or they will become scarred like you did from viewing it.

The ""plot"" of the film is based around a porn director who wants to insert horror into his next porn project. After getting the green light from his boss, he calls the next film ""Horno"", a lame combination of Horror and porno. At the same time as this is happening, one of the horno films stars & his girlfriend take a new drug, which transforms them into zombies who appear later on at the Horno film set to disembowel and eat the rest of the cast. That's our movie in a nutshell.

Anything about this that seems interesting at all must have been unintentionally done by my writing, because I guarantee you, none of it is. Every type of sad excuse for a joke falls flat. Every sight gag is terrible. Everyone's acting skills are across the board horrible. This is the type of movie that hurts your head. The type of movie that ""bad movie"" lovers watch over and over again while drunk. If thats your way to be entertained, then so be it. I am not a lover of bad movies. I want to be entertained. Sometimes I am entertained by what others consider bad movies. This however, is beyond bottom of the barrel painful. The movie runs 50 minutes. Less than an episode of your favorite T.V. show. Yet, it still seems like it drags on. This film has been called tasteless and offensive by others. That's giving it way too much credit. It's just a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this.",1382227200,,2121,4.158150851581508
8471713,1,B002KPI8WU,"We were intrigued by the title. That's really the only positive thing I can say for this disaster. It isn't even campy, or charmingly low-budget. Nor does it deliver on the premise of its title. Just say no...",1364169600,,209,4.526315789473684
8471714,1,B002KPI8WU,"It might have had some value if:
There were any humor at all, but there wasn't.
The actors were in any way attractive, but they weren't.

Sets were cheap and ""special effects"" were terrible to non-existent.
Overall, it did not even qualify as being so bad it was good because you laughed at it. It was simply ugly and boring.",1357344000,2,325,4.416666666666667
8471715,1,B002KPI8WU,"Yes, this one is a bit on the tooooo generic side. I do enjoy B horror films the best but this one, might need only a small consideration. If you want to torture a family member,,,,,,have them sit through this one. Premise sounds great, which of course is why i purchased it, but it just does not have the WOW factor. A good filler for any home video library none-the-less",1332806400,,372,4.328571428571428
