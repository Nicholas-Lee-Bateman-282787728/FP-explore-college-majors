8497500,2,B006GB2SHA,"The actual movie itself is not much better than a VHS copy I own (which I'll be keeping).  Also, why do people who convert movies to DVD have to change the aspect ratio?  The DVD has been formatted in 1:78 apparently using a 1:33 format from a VHS copy for their transfer (the original movie was actually shot in 1:75).  If they couldn't get an original print, please don't make it worse by cutting the top and bottom off a 1:33 aspect ratio copy to achieve the ""widescreen"" effect. Not cricket!",1460937600,,495,4.417582417582418
8497501,3,B006GB2SHA,"THE ELECTRONIC MONSTER (aka: ESCAPEMENT) is about insurance investigator, Jeff Keenan (Rod Cameron),  who is looking into a fatal car accident, and finds himself uncovering a murderous experiment. Complete w/ mad science and a mind-melting ""dream"" machine, Keenan has stumbled into an insane conspiracy. The scientists are all Nazis, w/ one even wearing a monocle! This all has something to do w/ the unfortunate patients in a psychiatric clinic. With its by loopy, woo-woo sound effects, this movie isn't your typical 50's sci-fi. It actually has a bit of a creep-factor going on. Also contains some groovy dream sequences. It does get a bit long-winded however, and could have benefited by losing about 15-20 minutes from its running time...",1442707200,,743,5.243697478991597
8497502,3,B006GB2SHA,Something to watch.  Dull and lifeless movie.  Semi-campy at best.,1438819200,,66,5.5
8497503,3,B006GB2SHA,"Fair British semi-sci-fi thriller.  Some ex-Nazi types develop a dream machine that they plan to use to control peoples thoughts.  The best part of the film are the dream sequences which are rather surreal for the 50s.  I bought the VCI Vault Classics DVD-R release which is not bad, though not perfect.  It could be that there is no better master for this film.",1382227200,4,362,4.609375
