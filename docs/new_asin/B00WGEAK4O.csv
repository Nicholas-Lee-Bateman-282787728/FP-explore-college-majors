7132099,5,B00WGEAK4O,I'm not quite sure why everyone is maling such a gripe about the price.the restoration of the first season was stellar and I assume the second season will be the same. If people understood the amount of money it took to restore a show like this - it would make sense what you are paying for is quality and the chance to see this show like it was the first time.,1430438400,15,361,4.098591549295775
7132100,1,B00WGEAK4O,"Any I love Lucy fan like myself are better off buying the DVD seasons. Becouse no one in there right mind would pay a bit over a houndred dollars for every season of I love Lucy to come out on blu ray. I mean the price is a joke, and Amazon should know that buy now.",1430265600,20,266,3.767857142857143

7132115,5,B00WGEAK4O,"I have been a big fan of I Love Lucy & Lucille Ball. When I seen this, I knew I had to purchase them for my mother. This was a Christmas gift and after a few weeks of watching them, from what she's told me is the quality is amazing. She doesn't ever remember the shows being this crystal clear and perfect. She loves the bonus features, it allows her to learn new things about the show she hadn't before. This, for sure, is a must have for any I Love Lucy fan!",1453593600,,460,3.956989247311828
7132116,5,B00WGEAK4O,Item was as expected.,1453507200,,21,4.5
7132117,5,B00WGEAK4O,this is worth it. I love Lucy is the best. One of my favorite shows growing up. And having these on bluray is even better. Have the original season sets but whenever another season comes out on Blu Ray I'm switching them out on my DVD shelf and adding the Blu Ray version. Love how the picture is much more clearer and slimmer packs too.,1453075200,2,337,4.2
7132118,4,B00WGEAK4O,I really love I love Lucy  the 2nd  season is really funny .the  Philip Morris commercial s are amazing .  This DVD is just great.,1452124800,,130,4.08
7132119,5,B00WGEAK4O,The second Blu-ray video of I Love Lucy is great to watch and laugh. I have the first video of that show.,1446768000,,105,3.8181818181818183
7132120,5,B00WGEAK4O,"Outrageous price for consumers, but it is s rare restoration on bluray with all the old titles credits and extras. They have really done proud the most loved TV series ever!",1440892800,,173,4.612903225806452
7132121,5,B00WGEAK4O,"So happy with this set. Can't ask for anything more. A lot of love put in here. One has to see/have it to understand. The episodes played seamlessly. I didn't have audio sync issues, thank goodness. Although it could be because I just bought the latest Blu-Ray player with the latest software, perhaps? I don't know. But it works. And the color episode of ""Job Switching"" looks even better than the TV broadcast. I also noticed more details in the colored private film snippets of ""The Audition"". I compared it with the DVD set.",1440028800,3,528,4.627659574468085
7132122,3,B00WGEAK4O,"Disc 1 - Episode : Operetta - Half way thru the episode, the disc freezes. This then causes the player to return to the main menu, making you have to restart the disc. Unable to play that episode - tried it twice to make sure it was the disc and not player. It was the disc.

Also, I have noticed that the sync is off on a few episodes as well.  I will be returning the item back for a replacement.  The video and sound quality is exceptional. Unfortunately, I received a defective item.",1439683200,5,487,4.159574468085107
7132123,3,B00WGEAK4O,"There a sound sync problem, at least on ""job switching,"" that's not on the DVDs.  Does anyone else have this problem?",1439596800,3,117,4.571428571428571
7132124,5,B00WGEAK4O,Just as great as the 1st season. Highest rating!,1439251200,,48,4.444444444444445
7132125,5,B00WGEAK4O,"The original broadcasts look great! As a life long Lucy fan, not yet born in the 50s, it's amazing to see the show as it originally aired.  I received my blu-ray today and I noticed that the audio/video sync is a bit off on some episodes in my set. Job Switching being one of the episodes. Has anyone else noticed this on their set?",1439078400,2,332,4.1875
7132126,5,B00WGEAK4O,I LOVE LUCY Ultimate Season 2 on blu ray allows us to enjoy all 31 episodes exactly as broadcast by CBS to the nation those many decades ago!  These wonderful 29 minute episodes include the original sponsor Lucy and Ricky animated stick-figures.  Not a single PHILIP MORRIS commercial is omitted!,1438732800,9,296,4.9
7132127,5,B00WGEAK4O,"People, PLEASE stop driving the review rating down on this wonderful product based solely on price. As another reviewer mentioned, the cost involved in doing a frame by frame restoration of 60+ year old films has to be through the roof. CBS is sparing no expense in putting these superb ""Ultimate Seasons"" together. What do you all expect the price to be, 20 bucks? If it's out of your price range, either don't buy it, or wait about a year until the price drops substantially.

Now, as for the product itself, I received my ""Ultimate Season 2"" on it's release date, 8/4/15. I'm about 6 episodes in, and so far season 2 is just as gorgeous as season 1. Stunning picture quality. The bonus features are great as well. I'm a Lucy fanatic, but I've never seen ""The I Love Lucy Movie"" before. So glad that they included it in the bonus features. The ""Job Switching"" episode with audio commentary was really cool too. Thomas J. Watson is the man! He's doing an awesome job producing these Blu-ray sets. I know that he loves Lucy, and that these releases are a labor of love for him. Keep 'em comin', my man. There will ALWAYS be a market for I Love Lucy.",1438646400,8,1149,4.4454976303317535
7132128,5,B00WGEAK4O,"I don't have to see this to know that it will be great like Volume 1.  For those of you complaining about no interest and possible discontinuation of the series on blu ray...RELAX.  These show are just making their way onto HD stations.  They're still marketable and profitable.  They will continue to master in HD and have the added bonus of us all buying the series again on blu ray.  It's a win-win situation.  They WILL release all seasons.  Therefore, punk, I have to ask you one question.  Can you wait for the price to come down or do you need it now?",1437177600,10,558,4.349514563106796
7132129,4,B00WGEAK4O,"The fact that another season is coming out in Blu-ray is great.  The problem is that Paramount/CBS is releasing these with super high prices.  While plenty of people say you can just wait and they'll eventually come down in price (like season 1 did) and that is true, the problem is that if they keep releasing these with high prices and people keep waiting a year to buy, they may eventually stop releasing for perceived lack of demand.  Plenty of people are already nervous that this is what's happened with Andy Griffith since both Lucy and Griffith S1 blu's were released at the same time and now there's only notice of Lucy S2.  They may have wrongly assumed that just because people didn't want to buy Andy Griffith S1 for a hundred bucks that there's no demand, when really there is demand, just at a reasonable price-point like 30-35 dollars.  Over a hundred dollars for one season of Lucy on Blu-ray, when you can buy the entire series for that price on DVD with LOADS of special features also, is NOT reasonable and I don't see how people can even try to defend it, no matter how MUCH you love lucy!  Amazon's not the problem here - CBS/Paramount is.",1430784000,58,1160,4.526315789473684
7132130,3,B00WGEAK4O,"Obviously no one has seen this yet. I'm sure the Blu-Ray's are fantastic, but I can understand people's distaste for the the price (although, you notice, these prices go down significantly in a short period of time). The fact is that many of the popular episodes of the show are available on both Hulu and Amazon in the HD format. Is this 1080p? For Amazon, most likely, for Hulu, definitely not (720p).

But, at the same time, not every episode is available with those subscriptions, and that is clearly in a brilliant effort to get people to want to purchase full seasons on Blu-Ray. The price is high, but it will definitely go down. For the amount of money put into restoring the series and the amount of people who are considering this as a first day purchase, that original price is definitely set right.",1430438400,5,810,4.586206896551724
8713300,5,B00WGEAK4O,"My son loves this dvd he likes part where she eats all those cholicates and puts it in her mouth and hat very funny episode.

8713306,5,B00WGEAK4O,"What's going on? When can we expect Season 3 (and the following) to be released on bluray?
Or is it just another example of teasing fans with just the first 2 seasons and then just stop? :-(",1483056000,4,190,4.162162162162162

8713309,5,B00WGEAK4O,"We purchased Season 1 and 2 on Blu-ray, and can't wait to watch them. My Husband, Grandfather and I both love Lucy! People that complaining about the original release price, is understandable. But, if we want paramount to release the entire collection of I Love Lucy on Blu-ray, we have to keep buying the sets, and save up some money to get them people. If we don't buy them when released, and we all wait a year to purchase til the price drops, CBS/Paramount will think that there is no demand for the show! There will ALWAYS be a market for I Love Lucy! This is one of, if not the best show of all time! CBS, Please Release Season 3 on Blu-ray! There are millions of us, who love the show, and want to buy it to have in our collection. I own all 9 seasons on DVD! I can't wait to collect them all as they are released and watch them on Blu-ray. I will cherish these Bluray sets forever! Buy this season, and season 1 no matter what the price is now. If the sales are high for Seasons 1-2, them we will likely see 3-6, and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour on Bluray as well. I can't wait to start watching!",1471737600,4,1101,4.149532710280374
