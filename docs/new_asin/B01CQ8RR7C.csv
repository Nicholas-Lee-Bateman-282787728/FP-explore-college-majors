7688485,1,B01CQ8RR7C,"If you have any political views that are not pro abortion, anti-religion, pro witchcraft you should not waste your time with this series.  The true views of the producers of this series becomes manifest this season.  You will see the inmates successfully tinker with witchcraft, ridicule Christ and nuns, make fun of killing unborn babies, and then praise the Freakonomics abortion theories.  Of course they have to talk about Freakonoics using a white hick so they are PC when really the authors meant that crime went down because black babies were aborted after roe vs wade.  This show is the liberal agenda run amuck to its ultimate and disgusting conclusion.  I cannot watch this anymore.",1514419200,,692,4.982608695652174

7688499,5,B01CQ8RR7C,"Having 3 X 13 episodes to binge on is such a treat for lovers of this series!  The first 2 series focused intensely on the transition that Piper Chapman, marvelously played by Taylor Schilling, must make, from society debutante to captive felon.  With series 3, the focus shifts to examining stories of other women inmates.  Jenji Kohan is clearly trying to develop an ensemble cast, and series 3 has certainly become a showcase for several fine actresses.  But...I feel the focus has disappeared into fragmented vignettes that show snippets from past lives of as many inmates as possible.  When Piper does appear, it's to show her becoming more desperate to find her feet in prison by starting a creepy business selling used panties - yuck!  Yes, this does show her in a different light, but it becomes more farce than character development.  Nevertheless, Ms. Schilling carries off this part of the role with a suggestion that she's in on the joke - that this is just another phase for her, just like her brief fling with another woman.  She shows poignant glimpses of the ""real"" Piper:  frightened, alone, and desperate to survive, and these are just enough to allow a viewing fan to hang in there, and hope that the series will shift back to a Piper-centric story.",1495929600,,1268,4.779816513761468

7688575,5,B01CQ8RR7C,"ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK  has taken a story shift. Season 3 is less about one the most annoying characters around,  Piper Chapman, and more a character piece of the delightful ensemble cast.

New characters are introduced as we lost a few in Season 2.  It seems like a show about female criminals in a hilariously low security prison would get stale but somehow the writers keep the interest up. Season 3 is much less violent and we see the back stories of many of our imprisoned ladies. The show may be about seriously tiresome upscale princess Piper but she is becoming an afterthought in this cast of deliciously rich characters. Piper is falling to the background but does come up with a rather disgusting (if harmless) way to make money from prison. Her relationship with Alex is finally blossoming as a new potential love interest for Piper suddenly appears. Our guards are as inept as ever and this prison seems like a summer camp with dormitory rooms. No locked doors and everyone seems to be able to walk around freely without interruption.

It's a fun show to watch. It can be hard to relate to a group of desperate prisoners trying to survive. A nurturing spirit can arise even in the most hardened criminal. It doesn't seem like anyone was wrongly committed and it's funny to think a person can go to prison for selling harmless substances saying they are drugs.  Our characters are growing and each actor's talent is becoming more and more evident as they relish their roles. Starring in a prison comedy/drama may not be an actor's dream but here is a change for delightful actors of all ages and races to shine. There are just too many actors to praise in this show. But here are a few  Uzo Aduba is the amazingly odd Suzanne ""Crazy Eyes"" who grows and matures this season. We see more of Red (Kate Mulgrew). What a great role for an older actress. Nick Sandow as Joe Caputo deserves kudos as a troubled man trying to honestly run a prison. I could go on and on praising some of the quirky characters that light up the screen.

Oddly enough the series ends on an upbeat and joyous surprise...not the usual cliffhanger we expect from series like this ones. Only the fate of one main character leaves us hanging. The ending is long and somewhat contrived but yet it is fun and I only want more!",1470614400,3,2305,4.537349397590361

7688580,5,B01CQ8RR7C,Really like this series.  Getting darker with each season but suppose that is to be expected from a series about prison life.  I enjoy watching women's lives and these are well written.  Especially interested in seeing corporate prisons depicted.  I detest the concept of jailing people to make a buck-or-million off their misery.  Too bad for me I live in the country and can't get Netflix but am okay with buying the discs.,1470355200,,425,4.767123287671233
7688581,3,B01CQ8RR7C,"Still worth watching but Season 3 is more like a kids summer camp than the ruthless try and survive federal prison it was in the first two seasons.  Crazy Eyes, Pennatucky and other mentally deranged psychopaths that kept everyone on their toes are now nice people, reduced to one writing a prison version of Fifty Shades of Grey and the other becoming the new van driver.  They are even victims in this season.  There's no one really under any threat in this one, except one character who gets bullied due to blaming another inmate's kid for their own failure and the cute Asian girl is bullied by a member of new cult group that forms in the prison.  Gone are the days where they would get searched for any sharp objects and the like when returning from work, in this one we even have a kids visit day where anyone can move freely around the prison.  The main threat for the first couple of DVDs is will the prison close?

There's a lot more flashback stories, some with the actor pretending to be a younger version of themselves in a pre prison life and some with child actors.  I wasn't always sure who the child actor was supposed to be at times as it didn't always flow from the older person in a scene to the same character in a flashback.  There's a few new inmates, new guards, some recent season newbies such as Ruby Rose get a lot more action.  But it's probably the old inmates that are the reason to watch this one, even if they are watered down versions of themselves.

Spoilers - I'm hoping the prison will somehow become a branch of the maximum security prison, which is owned by the same people who bought it, and the bus loads of new inmates are the overflow from there.  Since they all escaped obviously they would be maximum security prisoners too now, so the two groups will be forced to live and interact together.",1470182400,,1836,4.4183976261127595

7688641,2,B01CQ8RR7C,"A blinding disappointment on so many levels. After the incredible first 2 seasons of ""Orange is the new Black"", my anticipation for season 3 was incredibly high, however after viewing the first 4 episodes my interest was beginning to wane, (alarm bells started ringing), after 8 episodes my interest was in total free fall (yes we have reached Defcon 3!)  and after suffering through the last episode (what were they thinking!> all that was missing from that fiasco was a Joni Mitchell or Beth Orton song playing continuously! )  my interest was totally gone! The overall flow of this season seemed to have a hazy ""sugary"" glow over it, possibly they were trying to tell too many background  stories, (ticks for that) yes we found out more about the various inmates (which was a good idea in theory)  but at times this was only dished out sparingly,  the flow of the narrative suffered because of this. Yes there were moments of sheer power and intensity that gave me hope that things were going to pick up , this was only a spasmodic reprieve and sadly the tedious slide continued. Lets hope this amazing (except for this season)  series has not ""jumped the shark"" because it would be such a terrible waste of talent, I am optimistic that season 4 will get things back on track, I sincerely hope so!",1466035200,5,1300,4.655021834061135

Can't wait for season 4.",1465084800,,283,5.558139534883721
7688654,3,B01CQ8RR7C,"Well, the first two seasons were good. This third one represents a sudden and significant drop in quality. Most of the main characters are the same; its the dialogue and storyline that cant, for even one episode, manage to rise above mediocrity. The comedy is mostly lame and the drama arcs are silly and underwhelming in comparison to the ruckus Vee, now dead, brought in Season 2. Inmate Piper Chapman and her baggy eyes have become almost completely unlikable. The fact that transsexual men are still men is (finally) addressed and the plot makes practical use of the womens dirty panties, but theres not much else to compliment about this disappointing season.

7688657,4,B01CQ8RR7C,"Season Three of OITNB is a mixed bagsome things work and others dont. The series adopts a lighter tone and there are no villains like Vee to give the proceedings some darkness for contrast.

Piper Chapman is no longer the central focus which is just as well as her storyline has basically run its course. The writers probably realized this too because a lot of her screen time is consumed by lesbian sex scenes with Alex. I loved Laura Prepon in THAT 70S SHOW but her character her is not very likeable or interesting and I hope she doesnt return for Season Four. Sadly, Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) is out mid-season and Australian inmate Stella (Ruby Rose) fails miserably as a replacement. Another newbie, the jittery chatterbox Lolly (Lori Petty) fares much better.

Some storylines that would have worked better for a handful of episodes are stretched out for the entire season and seem forced: Cindy wants to convert to Judaism just to be able to eat Kosher cafeteria meals; Norma becomes leader of a new religious following; Piper starts an underground business selling dirty panties online using her outside connections and Crazy Eyes becomes a popular authoress thanks to her imaginative science fiction erotica.

Sofias gender identity begins to cause trouble among some of the inmates in a timely storyline and Dayas baby arc is finally wrapped up. We get to see the backstories of Chang and Leanne and more history of Pennsatucky and Big Boo. Lastly, there is a big corporate takeover that allows us to learn what kind of man Caputo really is.

Not as gripping or addictive as the first two seasons, but the finale looks to be setting up an interesting Season FourIm in!",1464652800,,1676,4.809027777777778

Words that come to mind after watching Season 3 are: boring, tepid, meandering, pointless, drama-less, meaningless, frustrating, disheartening, unsatisfying, flat, misfire, flop... you get the point.  I didn't find one thing interesting or fun this season.  All the various stories seemed pointless, didn't connect, led nowhere and failed to be entertaining.  Making things worse, some of the best characters in the first two seasons were left out of this season and replaced by bland and forgettable new characters.  I guess I could go on and on about how bad this season is, but Season 3 already wasted enough of my time, why waste more.",1464393600,4,672,5.128440366972477
7688661,5,B01CQ8RR7C,"I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 of Orange is the New Black, so I was eager to check out the 3rd season.  I was extremely pleased to find it just seems to keep getting better.  Season Three is my favorite so far.  The plot seems to get thicker and the characters all more realistic.  It's like the darkest show with the sweetest heart lurking beneath it.  It really highlights the realities of the prison system and American culture in general, this time around focusing a little more on corporate culture (and hitting that mark so well)!  Also very authentic portrayals of humanity - within this clever and out-there show that entertains throughout every. single. episode.  So impressed with this season and glad I checked it out.",1464307200,,735,4.74015748031496

I might add that my husband also has enjoyed the show. We started into Season 3....and he fell asleep! He even commented that it wasn't as good. It seems like the story line has been stretched about as thin as it could go, and after watching the ending, I can't imagine there will be a Season 4. Just as well. Piper was never particularly likable anyway, but that psycho look and act towards the end was just too much. And who'd have thought Pensatucky would be someone you would root for? The best thing I can say about Season 3 was that it was actually funny at times, which it hadn't been previously.

7688671,5,B01CQ8RR7C,"I'll start by saying something a couple of people aren't understanding.  This is a DVD release.  It's a Netflix show so yes it's been on there for a while but they're all made available on DVD sometime before the next season begins.
Season one was a little fluffier.  Warming up to the audience. Season 2 was harsher.  Violence, characters you love getting broken down (like Poussey in the showers). In the way that Jenji did with Weeds she did exactly what I thought she would. Orange came into its own..  The characters are becoming more multidimensional, the comedy is getting darker, people you love to hate, it's getting sexier, they're yanking characters out and switching them up and it's probably going to continue on that route. Oh they'll be back.  I'm pretty sure of that.  I can't wait to see what she's gonna do next.",1459296000,20,830,4.682758620689655
7688672,4,B01CQ8RR7C,"Season 3 had some retooling done to expand the show's focus. Piper Chapman is no longer the central character in season 3. She's still in the series, but her role is now equally time split between several characters. I totally get this change from a production standpoint of the series. Piper had I think an 18 month sentence in prison and this is the 3rd season of the series. By expanding the focus to other characters they can dramatically slow down the overall passage of time so that Piper is still in prison for a while. Plus the other characters are interesting. And the rich girl from Connecticut in prison thing was getting played out anyway. So this is a good change.

A bad change is that they totally retooled Piper Chapman's character. There was just no need for this. It was quirky and funny at first. But it gets ridiculous as the season goes on. I don't want to spoil it with details for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but Piper basically becomes a prison mobster running a crime syndicate from the inside. Yeah...okay...uh huh....that's a total rewrite of the character.

The politics of running the prison plays a bigger role in season 3 in a very interesting way. It adds a new dimension to the plot to keep things fresh.

There are also new characters that give the show some new life. Lori Petty in particular brings a character to the show that was introduced briefly in the season 2 premiere last year. She's an amazing actress that does a brilliant job of portraying an institutionalized crazy person. Ruby Rose is the other new addition. Her character has a much more prominent role and more screen time, but I think Lori Petty actually adds more to the series in terms of character strength and acting.

The day to day drama of the prisoners drops in intensity from season 1 and 2 though. In season 1 and 2 you'd have story arcs where big major things were going on like federal drug trials, or the really hard to watch season 2 premiere with Piper in a holding facility in Chicago prior to her testimony. Season 3 really doesn't have any of that. It's more even keeled and mundane compared to the first 2 seasons.

I loved both seasons 1 and 2 of the show. I just liked season 3. It's very much still watchable, especially if you sat through the first two seasons. But season 4 needs to go back up a notch or this series may have lost my interest.",1458691200,22,2374,4.4734411085450345
