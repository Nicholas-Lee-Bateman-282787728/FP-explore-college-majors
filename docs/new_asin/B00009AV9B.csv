7990354,5,B00009AV9B,"This details the dreamland crew who are the top (IMHO) skatepark builders in the world, these guys design, build and ride the parks, hardcore skaters - unsung heros.  if you like concrete you will like this movie.",1182038400,,213,4.756756756756757
7990355,5,B00009AV9B,"This is a GREAT companion to ""Fruit of the Vine"". Where the former dealt with skate locales across the country, ""Northwest"" deals with- what else- the Northwest, specifically the Pacific Northwest. It's a gritty, roots-level look at local skating where there are no trophies or self-congratulatory nonsense- this is just awesome skating by guys who want nothing more than to skate better and higher and sicker than they skated the day before. I found myself terribly inspired to build a concrete skate area or pool after watching this (as I did after watching ""Fruit of the Vine"" for that matter). If you skate, and some of you freaks who don't, you should get this and check out what you could do in your own home town. Get inspired and go skate!",1062892800,,747,4.709923664122138
