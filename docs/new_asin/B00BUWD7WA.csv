5676628,1,B00BUWD7WA,"When I first heard of Tinman, I was genuinely excited. A new take on the Wizard of Oz sounded like a lot of fun...

HOWEVER...

This show starts off well enough, the characters are re-imagined in creative ways, and the plot was engaging, at first. Then the show began dragging... It failed to live up to the any sort of potential it did have. The show chose not to explore the land of Oz, or even make any obvious callbacks to either of the two movies. Instead of remaining in cannon with the rest of the lore set up by the two previous movies, it decided to make up it's own lore and I almost forgot it took place in Oz.

And Zooey Daschenelle is horrible in it.

I am not sure if this follows any sort of lore from the books or not, but even so, it was not entertaining and no amount of ""High Definition"" will change that.",1366934400,5,824,4.13125

5676643,5,B00BUWD7WA,"This well made for TV mini-series Directed by Nick Willing will hold your attention from the beginning. All the actors were well chosen and Zooey Deschanel as DG will enchant you. At first it seems like any other contemporary contrived script that was just using a snappy title. Then you think this is Smallville and where is Clark? Then slowly the story unfolds and before you realize hat has happened you are caught up in the intrigue of a complex story with all of the elements found in Frank Baum's original story but actually better designed. The film, even though being promoted as the darker side of OZ, in reality is just a little more down to earth or up in the sky fairy tale.

DG grows up in a rural town by elderly loving parents. There she is a waitress tat is contemplating of going out into the wide world. She has strange dreams of another world.  Before her parents can tell her, the other world becomes a reality and DG becomes the target or key to an insidious plot to destroy the O.Z.

Seems like this Blu-ray has no region code because it worked without any problems on my European Player.

5676773,5,B00BUWD7WA,"I didn't have the luck of catching this when it originally aired.  However, I got the DVD off netflix.

Let me tell you, I LOVED this miniseries (movie, etc).  I had plans to buy this, but plans change.  Years later, I found it in a $5 bargain bin at a Wal-Mart.  However, I didn't know that this DVD was different from the one I orginally viewed.  This one was a re-release from Mill Creek Entertainment.  So, apart from a few presentation and cosmetic issues, it was the same.

The story is a well-written, high energy, action/drama/science fiction film with hints of fantasy, comedy, and even thriller.

The cast is simply superb.  Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as the innocent but strong willed DG (and allusion to the heroine of L. Frank Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" Dorothy Gale).  Alan Cumming blew me away as Glitch.  Raoul Trujillo and Richard Dreyfus were also great in their respective roles.  However, in my opinion, the highlight performances of this piece were Neal McDonough as Wyatt Cain, the titular Tin Man (whose heartlessness is a different and more compelling story than Baum's) and Kathleen Robinson as the wicked Azkadellia.

Like I said, the Mill Creek Entertainment release has cosmetic differences.  While it still presents the story, I would not recommend this edition for purchase.  I would recommend the original release or even the special release.",1376870400,,1385,4.93073593073593
5676774,5,B00BUWD7WA,"This movie is a nice modern interpretation/presentation of The Wizard of Oz that is appealing to the adult in us. This is not a children's fairytale representation of the books, and if you need that type of story you will be disappointed in the first minute when D.G. (the Dorothy) is pulled over for speeding. The characters are adults and it isn't light, colorful and cheery. It has all the main characters (a Dorothy, a tin man, a scardy-cat, a guy missing half his brain, and of course an evil witch.) It is set as if it were hundreds of years later than the original, but yet it maintains a loose coupling to the original written story.

So, tuck your kids into bed, and venture along with a young lady fighting evil and bringing light and happiness back into the O.Z.",1373328000,8,773,4.4822695035460995
5676775,4,B00BUWD7WA,"Oz the Great and Powerful is being released on Blu-Ray and DVD this week, but the film isn't the only recent Oz incarnation. Back in 2007, the Sci Fi Channel (now known as SyFy) aired a three-part mini-series Tin Man, based on L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but with a science fiction twist. Mill Creek Entertainment released Tin Man on Blu-Ray and DVD last month, which they kindly sent me a free copy in exchange for my honest review.

Zooey Deschanel plays DG, a small town waitress who life is completely changed when a storm sends her to O.Z. (Outer Zone). She quickly befriends Glitch (played by Alan Cumming), a former ""Tin Man"" law enforcer named Wyatt Cain (played by Neal McDonough), and Raw (played by Raoul Trujillo). O.Z. is now ruled by Azkadellia, who had overthrown her own mother, the Queen, and Azkadellia happens to be DG's sister.

DG learns about her true heritage. It seems that the original Dorothy Gale is actually her ""greatest-great-grandmother."" She soon realizes that all the evil in O.Z. was created by a mistake she made as a child. Along with her new friends, she plans on stopping the evil Azkadellia and restoring O.Z. to its original glory.

Special features on this release are:

  Beyond the Yellow Brick Road
  The Making of Tin Man
  On Set With the Director - Nick Willing
  Wizard Tricks - Hilarious Gag Reel
  Interviews with the cast & crew
  Tim Man Original Trailer
  Raw & Uncut With Raoul Trujillo
  Making the Mystic Man With Richard Dreyfuss and Director Nick Willing

I remember watching Tin Man when it originally aired in 2007, which is more of a steampunk version (and somewhat of a sequel) of the original classic. I'm not the biggest fan of Zoey Deschanel, but she does a descent job as DG throughout the miniseries. The entire supporting cast does wonders compared to the horrible Witches of Oz mini-series. There are many twists and turns throughout Tin Man, but it does fall into the typical Sci Fi Channel's (SyFy) clichd touches, especially for the final the act. The mini-series does look great on Blu-Ray and it does contain many extras. Die-hard Oz fans may not like the new tech version of the beloved classic, but I'm sure others will enjoy watching it. Overall, Tin Man is well acted and an intriguing mini-series.",1370736000,15,2292,4.722921914357682
5676776,4,B00BUWD7WA,"If you are looking for a continuation of the Wizard of Oz in the style of the Judy Garland musical, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a new take on it, then you may be pleasantly surprised. It is NOT Disney's mediocre ""Return To OZ"" or their even worse ""OZ The Great and Powerful"". IF you liked them, you may not like this. I did enjoy it.
D.G. (Zooey Deschanel who is very good, despite what the previous review says) is a small town waitress who wants more from life, but doesn't know what. Through a series of events she ends up in OZ, where it turns out she came from in the first place. A cruel sorceress/witch is turning it into a wasteland after deposing the great Mystic Man/Wizard (Richard Dreyfuss) and D.G. meets versions of the Lion the Scarecrow and the Tin Man, who was one of the wizard's police (hence ""tin man"").
What is done to the Mystic Man is disturbing, and so are things that happen - I won't spoil it by saying what - but this is more a reworking for adults and not children. I did not see this on TV and ignored it when friends tried to get me to watch it on DVD. I finally gave in, and the result is I bought it when it came out on Blu-ray.
Do not expect the MGM musical. It may take a bit to get into, because you are not sure what is happening at first, as D.G. has no idea, but give it time and you will probably enjoy it as much as I did. Give this one a look. D.G. is not trying to be a heroine, but is thrown into it and Deschanel is perfect as the fish-out-of-water girl next door.",1368230400,10,1529,4.0495049504950495

8574281,4,B00BUWD7WA,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The discs play fine.

I like this series. Zooey Deschanel is the good guy babe and Kathleen Robertson is the bad buy babe. Neal McDonough from Star Trek is a good guy and one of the bad guys from Battlestar Galactic is one of the henchmen. However, this series spends too much time zooming in on Kathleen Robertson's breasts to be a family show. Too much time is devoted to focusing on her cleavage to attract a large female audience would be my guess too. I've listed some miniseries below that are more family friendly.

If you're looking for something more mature you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2248,5.131147540983607
