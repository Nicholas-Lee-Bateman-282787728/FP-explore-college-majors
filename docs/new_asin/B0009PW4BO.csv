8065124,5,B0009PW4BO,Always interesting to watch Navy Seals at their Best!!! It's sorta like being a part of the action. A wild ride!!!,1386288000,,114,4.476190476190476
8065125,5,B0009PW4BO,"As an avid Ty Miller fan I purchased this to see a grown up ""Kid"". I was not disappointed, he still has the same cheeky grin that we all love.  Yes, it had boats, guns, etc but Ty is definitely the high point of this film, and for that it gets 5 stars. :-)",1362355200,,256,3.740740740740741
8065126,1,B0009PW4BO,"Who didn't do their homework?  Open circuit breathing apparatus instead of the closed circuit units used by the SEAL teams?  Lines like ""Pictures taken from the USS Arizona"".  Last I recall the USS Arizona is sitting at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.  '''(*_*)''' This movie really stinks.",1276473600,,286,5.0212765957446805
8065127,1,B0009PW4BO,"This is the second worst movie I have ever seen, the first being the second installation in the series.  Horrible plot, terrible special effects and very inaccurate portrayal of Navy SEALs and the weapons and tactics they employ.",1213056000,,229,5.026315789473684
