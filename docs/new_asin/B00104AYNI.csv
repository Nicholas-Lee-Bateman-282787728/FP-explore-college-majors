8236716,5,B00104AYNI,"Used to watch this starting 57 years ago on the recommendation of my best friend, Don Zabelka, who lived next with his parents and siblings. When Don passed away recently, I thought of this series and those days. A well made western series from ""back in the day.
Glad I bought it. Tris Coffin and Kelo Henderson worked their characterizations perfectly. One for all us boomers whose first job EVER was a cowboy. You know what I mean.",1412467200,,433,4.564102564102564

8236719,3,B00104AYNI,"I thought there would be more episodes on the 3 discs, not just 12. How Scottsdale used to be. Cool.",1365724800,2,100,4.05
8236720,3,B00104AYNI,"My interest in ""26 Men"" came about after reading the autobiography of director Harry Fraser. The filmography alludes to this late 1950s series which I confess I had not previously heard of. Fraser had worked as assistant director for four episodes, ""Trade Me Deadly"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Incident at Yuma"" and ""Man on the Run"", though he is uncredited under his real name.
The series celebrates the lawmen who helped bring law and order to the Arizona Territory. It was a reasonable successful series. However, it is easy to see why it is seldom seen today. Scripts are fairly lethargic and the episodes are short of action. However, characterisations are strong and Tristram Coffin is a good leading man.
""Gunsmoke"", ""Wagon Train"" and ""Rawhide"" easily eclipsed it at the time.
Well worth buying out of curiosity or if you are a completist.
Alpha certainly puts out lots of DVS of interesting and obscure movies and TV shows. I wish I owned the Alpha library.",1305417600,9,958,4.847560975609756
8236721,5,B00104AYNI,"This is a must have for any fan of the 50's to 60's western. Writing of the stories lie between the kiddies westerns (Lone Ranger and the like) and the adult westerns (Have gun, Will Travel and the like). Produced by Russell Hayden who learned his craft by playing sidekick to Hopalong Cassidy. They mostly avoid the usual western clichs. The DVD quality appears to come from 16mm prints. Somewhat soft but quite watchable and there are some obvious switching between available prints. Another great factor is for the most part, the avoidance of using stage sets.",1273881600,13,563,4.814432989690721
