2760882,5,B000N6UF0Q,"I love this show.  Kyra Sedgwick has created a very unique and endearing character, who also happens to be as tough as nails.  Some of the deleted scenes are hilarious.",1186963200,3,168,4.566666666666666
2760883,4,B000N6UF0Q,"My husband watched the pilot episode when he was on vacation at his mother's place.  He said it was good, but I didn't know how good it was!  Kyra Sedgewick is an awesome actress, and her chemistry with the other actors is top notch.  We watched both seasons in a matter of 3 days.  The storylines and plots are so original it keeps you guessing until the end.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes dramatic police shows.  It's the best I've seen yet!!",1186444800,4,465,4.348837209302325
2760884,5,B000N6UF0Q,I started watching the show towards the end of the second season but was immediately hooked!  The DVD's are great because they have some extra footage and a great background feature about how the show started.  I think this show is much better than the other cop shows out there!,1185148800,5,279,4.56
2760885,4,B000N6UF0Q,"I like this show. First, because it is in L.A and since I am from L.A, I believe L.A has a seedy underbelly just like many of the cold and dark cities of the east coast. The lead character (Brenda) is a good southern gal with commitment issues. She also has integrity so she is believable. She struggles to establish herself in a mans world and sometimes she does it and some times she falls flat on her face. Somehow she always solves the crime with the help of her team. They are a real mixed bag of personalities. It is entertaining without being over the top. Good stuff!",1184198400,4,575,4.284403669724771
2760886,5,B000N6UF0Q,I got this as a present for my wife because she has been a fan but I didn't watch it on TV. As it tuned out the DVD is much more enjoyable than the show on TV because the video and sound are much better than we can get thru our local cable provider.  I became a fan and recommend it to anyone that may have been on the edge.,1184025600,4,324,3.6285714285714286
2760887,5,B000N6UF0Q,"First up--Brenda Johnson has made me confess with her wily ways--the second season of ""The Closer"" is equally as good as the first. There are some plot developments that may season two unique though. First up, Brenda's mom (Francis McDormand)visits. Fritz moves in. Then movies out because Brenda's mom will be staying. As usual Brenda makes the bad guys talk whether it be the bizarre (the case of the cop and the psycho killer who mysterious killed each other at exactly the same time)or unexpected (a juror drops dead from cardiac arrest during a trial where the jury had been threatened).

I love this show with its mix of the quirky character of Johnson (who constantly fights the urge--not successfully I might add--to eat junk food)and her ability to figure out a crime. Unlike ""Monk"" this isn't focused more on the comedy elements but integrates them into a rich, suspenseful dramatic series. Sedgewick deserves to be nominated for an Emmy for her portrayal.

A fun and fascinating mystery ride, ""The Closer"" focuses on Deputy Chief of Police Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) is a fish out of water lured from Atlanta to L.A.by Assistant Police Chief Will Pope (J.K. Simmons J.J. Jameson from ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"") lead an elite unite that tackles high profile murder cases with her unusual approach to solving crimes. Her Georgia accent immediately sets her apart from her colleagues. She's much savvier underneath her down home accent than many give her credit for allowing her, like Columbo to tackle crimes that others might not be able to solve. Like Columbo and Monk she's got her own quirks (an addiction to junk food, she shows up at a crime scenes with her sick cat--named Cat--in a paper back and her southern charm can't quite hide her abrasive personality). It's a marvelous TV show with a terrific supporting cast (Jon Tenney, Robert Gossett among others).

 ""The Closer"" looks extremely good in this presentation with all 14 episodes (the finale is a two hour episode or two-parter however you want to look at it) episodes on four DVDs. The first season box states that the show is presented in full screen but we get the original letterboxed images as broadcast on TNT. ""The Closer: Season One"" isn't anamorphically enhanced which results in it being presented on my widescreen TV with bars everywhere (to the sides, on the top and bottom).

For the first season there are no featurettes (for example he superb set that Universal put out for ""Monk"" has a lot of background on the show)on the development of the series, how Kyra Sedgewick became involved in the show, interviews with the supporting cast or a glimpse into the creative process of the show. We get deleted scenes for the bulk of the episodes (they were clearly cut for time constraints) presented with the time code at the bottom of the images so clearly most were cut prior to the final assembly of the show.

The second season comes with a good featurette on the show and the season gag reel. The second season is anamorphically presented so it fills a widescreen TV without the black bars.

No commentary tracks which is disappointing but the price is right for the show and it's presented in thin packs making it easier to store the DVDs without taking up much room.

Well written, performed and directed ""The Closer"" looks solid in its DVD presentation but could be improved significantly for the second season. I'd suggest that Warner present the show anamorphically enhanced and include some featurettes or commentary tracks in addition to the deleted scenes. This top notch show one of the best of the season deserves a deluxe treatment but because it's on TNT and has a smaller audience it's unlikely we'll probably see either one of these improvements for future sets.",1174608000,40,3780,4.858695652173913
2760898,5,B000N6UF0Q,"I am a huge fan of the Closer, Kyra & the cast on the show have such a chemistry that each show, well I could watch it over and over.  Even more I am thrilled to have each series thanks to Amazon and their unbeatable prices.  Thanks Amazon.",1218844800,,240,3.9791666666666665
2760899,1,B000N6UF0Q,How come the price of the 2-season set is more than if you buy season 1 and season 2 seperately?,1215475200,,96,3.85
2760900,5,B000N6UF0Q,"It was a good surprise watching the DVD version of The Closer. It gets better and better at each episode because it's not only for the plot, story, suspense of a regular cop tv show, but mainly because of the caracters. They're so human you can almost touch them! Great!",1214265600,,270,4.42
2760901,5,B000N6UF0Q,"I am so happy I purchased this item. I was so happy with it. I can't seem to get enough of ""The Closer""  I am going to purchase the next one ASAP",1214092800,,145,3.53125
2760902,5,B000N6UF0Q,"I brought ""The Closer"" for my friend and though I'm not a follower of the series, she just adores it. She especially loves her favorite character, ""Brenda Johnson"" with her famous, ""Thank you SO much!"" phrase.",1210291200,,209,4.833333333333333
2760903,5,B000N6UF0Q,The DVD of the first 2 seasons is great...I like the series and am waiting for the third year to be released.  The actors in this series interact well together and there is lots of humor and VERY little crude language.  One of the best series to come out in a long time.,1209340800,,270,4.0754716981132075
2760904,5,B000N6UF0Q,"I had heard about this series but never seen it.  Was unable to rent it, so I took a chance and purchased Seasons 1 and 2.  Boy, am I glad I did.  It was well worth the money and has given my husband and me  HOURS of enjoyment, without the commercials.  I will be ordering the next season soon.",1207526400,,294,3.9152542372881354
2760905,5,B000N6UF0Q,Excellent quality cd's.  The series is fantastic.  I had not watched it originally but am convinced it is one of the best around.,1205798400,,129,4.565217391304348
2760906,5,B000N6UF0Q,"For fans of 'The Closer' this is a must-have, with unaired scenes and special features.",1205539200,,87,4.866666666666666
2760907,5,B000N6UF0Q,"The Closer is very entertaining, suspenseful. and continuosly realisitc. The characters interactions are realisitc and believable. The actors play off of each others reactions and emotions and show their vulnarabilites throughout each story line. It is interesting as the main story plays out you learn each characters strengths and weaknesses as they are portrayed. The stories may be different but each persons character is revealed a little more each time allowing viewers to get to know them and at times identify with them.",1205366400,,528,5.373493975903615
2760908,5,B000N6UF0Q,this is truely one of the best crime dramas to ever be on t.v.! the scripts are great the cast is excellent!,1204156800,,108,3.9545454545454546
2760909,5,B000N6UF0Q,"'The Closer' is the perfect blend of drama and comedy.  For me, it's like  'Law and Order' mixed with a dash of 'Gilmore Girls'.  I can't think of any episodes where I do not laugh out loud at least once, but above that is a fast-paced, complex LA police drama that holds interest until the very end.  The extra scenes included with the episodes are great, and the little bit of background commentary is entertaining and informative.  My husband was hooked with the first episode, but our favorite is 'To defend and protect' in Season 2 (I do not recommend seeing that episode out of sequence, though). Truly awesome show and worth owning!",1203811200,,639,4.619469026548672
2760910,5,B000N6UF0Q,"The Closer is one of the best series I viewed : all the characters are vividly sketched, the first of them being the lovely, cute Kyra Sedgwick, the plots are pretty well arranged, and humour is always present, never heavy. I'm waiting impatiently for the third season on DVD.

2760911,5,B000N6UF0Q,"This is ""the best"" show on television. Kyra Sedgwick and the entire cast are perfect. The writing and production are also ""first rate"". There is  a nice blend of quirky, funny moments woven into the fabric of the underlying story-line.",1190073600,6,235,4.875
2760912,5,B000N6UF0Q,You walk away you miss a minute you don't want to miss a minute of this show.  View 2 episodes and you will be a fan.  Sucks the season is over again.....,1189900800,3,154,3.78125
2760913,5,B000N6UF0Q,This is my favorite show and I just had to have it. I shop on line and Amazon has good quality and I get my purchases fast.,1189641600,2,123,3.5925925925925926
2760914,5,B000N6UF0Q,"Brenda Johnson is a fabulously brilliant yet interestingly neurotic police chief from the South who works in LA. If you'd like to watch a quirky leader in action, catch this series.

Having these CD's of the first two seasons is a great way to share the TNT series with family and friends who missed parts.

Love it!!! Can't wait to order the 3rd season!!!",1189036800,2,356,4.546875
2760915,5,B000N6UF0Q,This is one of the freshest shows to hit the screen in years.  Kyra Sedgwick is first class and the supporting cast absolutely rocks.  Great for an exercise workout - the suspense will keep you going!,1188000000,2,200,4.527777777777778
2760916,5,B000N6UF0Q,"i absolutely love the closer.  kyra sedgwick is an amazing actress, and she brings something special to this character.  i can't imagine anyone else other than kyra sedgwic as brenda lee johnson.  the rest of the cast is great, as well.  there's so much junk on tv that i can't stand, but this show just sucked me in from the first time i saw it.  what i really enjoy is the fact that it's not just about ""the crime.""  there's a lot of about the lives of the characters.  well...mostly brenda, but she's ""the closer.""  basically, the acting is great, the stories are intriguing, and it's just an amazing show.",1187827200,8,609,4.472727272727273
2760917,5,B000N6UF0Q,"Great story lines and phenomenal writing make this the best summer series on tv.  Kyra Sedgwick was born for this role. Some people may say her southern accent is too strong, but I find it a delight. Her politeness to her colleagues while delegating assignments is refreshing.  She's the best project manager I've seen in a long time.  She leaves no stone unturned. The way she eats her sweets and savors every bite is sensual and I look forward to seeing what the writers have in store for Brenda and Fritz. Can't wait for season three to come out on DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Closer-The-Complete-First-Two-Seasons/dp/B000N6UF0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Closer - The Complete First Two Seasons</a>",1187827200,4,762,5.846846846846847

The writing is clever and smart, the pace keeps you thinking.  I bought and watched the first season, and immediately ordered seasons 2 through 7.",1422057600,,307,4.884615384615385

8175480,5,B000N6UF0Q,"The 1st and 2nd seasons of the Closer are raw and yet startingly sensitive; while Det. Brenda Lee Johnson and her crew solve homicides in LA, California.  What is most intriquing,to me, is the explanation of the actual basis and initial details of the show. Or,specifically, the stream of details I missed by simply not viewing it from its inception. These episodes help me put together the later episodes that I viewed in seasons 3 and 4. I would highly recommend these seasons to reaquaint oneself with the background of the series or just for the sheer enjoyment of comparison and contrast to later episodes.",1231200000,,611,4.819047619047619

I never saw the first season,so I ordered this to watch till the new season starts. Can't get enough of Kyra Sedgwick. I look forward to seeing how Brenda will pull Fritz into the crime case. I enjoy the romance between Fritz and her, just love the way she gets flustered when her parents are coming. She's a south lady, funny and brilliant being the Deputy Police Chief. It's a great show.",1221955200,,511,4.333333333333333
