8205319,5,B000SHWYDG,This dvd is simply one of the best instructional dvds for learning clawhammer banjo! I hope that C. Coole will make another in the future!,1374364800,,138,4.56
8205320,4,B000SHWYDG,"I've been a student of Chris's since 2003. This is presented in the same way that Chris would structure an in-person lesson, though with fewer bad jokes. The presentation of the video is very plain, but clear enough to learn effectively from.

Chris is an excellent teacher and gifted player. If you can't make it to a lesson with him in Toronto, this is the next best thing.",1270771200,,375,4.514705882352941
8205321,5,B000SHWYDG,I have played a little clawhammer on and off for years UNTIL I picked up this DVD.  Now I'm playing a LOT!  Completely clear teaching approach that will actually have you playing beginning and intermediate techniques more quickly than you imagined possible.  Kudos to Chris for a fine product.,1263168000,,293,4.938775510204081
8205322,5,B000SHWYDG,"Chris does a great job of making it simple and straightforward.  I had a few months of 3 finger lessons and decided to give clawhammer a try, this dvd was recommended by my teacher.",1247011200,,181,4.323529411764706
8205323,5,B000SHWYDG,"Just back from Midwest Banjo Camp where Chris Coole happened to be teaching the Novice track for Clawhammer Banjo - and where I purchased this DVD.  His teaching style is wonderful - and his DVD is just like being there.  Chris gets right down to a few basic, but very specific, details - and these details make all the difference in the world!  After 2 years of half-hearted attempts, this is the tool that has finally gotten me going!  After the basics are detailed, several tunes are broken down into their essential ""parts"" and then put together into lovely melodic creations that you'll be surprised to find yourself playing quite easily.  I recommend this teacher (and this DVD) as being at the very top of the list.  If you want to learn to play Clawhammer Banjo, this is a great way to do it!",1213142400,2,800,4.520833333333333
