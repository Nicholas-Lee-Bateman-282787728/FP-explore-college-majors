7749515,1,B01F9QE3O8,"Wow.. Just wow... This was so bad. I honestly couldn't tell if it was supposed to be satire. Everything about this movie is horrible. The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the cheap jump scares are bad. If I could give it no stars I would. I cannot believe I actually spent money to rent and watch this horrible movie. I really don't understand why anyone would give this five stars unless it was supposed to be over the top stupid. I can believe that. There where parts I was actually laughing because it was so ridiculous. There is a scene where two of the characters are being attacked by flying silverware and I could only imagine people off stage just chucking silverware as hard as they could at the actors. After finding out this movie was made by the same people who brought us Sharknado, I couldn't help but think that this was a joke in itself.",1468368000,,852,4.364779874213837
7749516,5,B01F9QE3O8,"Good modern horror. Well made with some genuinely creepy moments. Stephen Manley's performance was excellent. Recommended.

7749517,5,B01F9QE3O8,"Okay, so yes, this is a ""direct-to-DVD"" film, so let's air that out right now. Secondly, yes, it's from The Asylum - the ""Sharknado"" studio. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this film! I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it had the look and feel of a bigger budget film. Say what you will about ""Sharknado"", but there is definitely some talent inside The Asylum. A few things that stood out for me: the lighting in this film was incredible, dynamic and moody, and was very well done. I enjoyed the soundtrack and thought it was perfectly suited to the on-screen action. The set was decorated very well, which is amazing considering that this film was actually shot inside an old house. The editing was coherent and I found it refreshing that this horror film didn't follow the stereotypical formula of 'everyone splits up and dies one-by-one in a predictably boring fashion'.
Stephen Manley has no trouble carrying the lead role and is dynamic and believable. The supporting cast also does a great job. This film is a little bit ""The Ring"", a little bit ""Ghostbusters"", a little bit ""Saw"", a little bit ""Ghost Adventures (TV series)"", a little bit ""The Exorcist"" and overall suspenseful, believable and entertaining.",1468195200,24,1225,4.838095238095238
7749518,5,B01F9QE3O8,"The is an incredibly fresh take on the horror genre! A BIG surprise from Asylum! Stephen Manley in particular shines as the troubled, teetering-on-madness leading man. Strong performances and satisfying chills and thrills throughout. GHOST HUNTERS delivers.",1468108800,10,257,5.972972972972973
7749519,1,B01F9QE3O8,"The film opens with the horrific deaths of Martha (Phyllis Spielman) and Gabby (Anna Harr) by a man with a mask and a voice enhancer so we can't understand what he is saying. Henry (Stephen Manley) the father in the family invites a team of ghost hunters to a home so he can put their souls to rest after they were tortured for a long period of time with the home prepared for torture.

Our team has special glasses to see ghosts and a machine to capture them and turn them into ectoplasma that is not fluorescent green. Oh yes they have that binary thing to extract a voice.

You have the film figured out when the guy inside the house behind the police barricade opens the door. This is a poorly conceived Asylum mockbuster for the new and most likely better ""Ghost Busters 2."" It is a bad combination of ghost/slasher movie, filmed at one location to save money.

Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing in FF mode. Pearry Reginald Teo should not be writing or directing films. He sucks at it.",1468108800,4,993,4.385869565217392
7749520,1,B01F9QE3O8,"I just claimed that ""Clash of the Dead"" might be the worst movie of all time, but NO barely a day later my gullible idiotic self, constantly searching for a low-budget horror film that will AT LEAST be in the ballpark of a classic like ""Phantasm,""  took a chance on this.
Were these ""actors"" TRYING to be terrible? I mean were they being ironically bad?
Look, I already lost ten points off my IQ watching this total junk (oh boy guess who the serial killer, whose mask looks like a freakn gasoline funnel I bleep you not, REALLY IS--you will guess in the first en minutes) that I will only say DO NOT RENT",1468022400,4,605,4.307017543859649
7749521,4,B01F9QE3O8,"WOW.  Much better than expected and the villain was actually a bit of a surprise!  The movie itself was ok, some of the acting mediocre but overall a great Prime movie for a rainy night in.  Much better than most free Prime Movies, and the horror was pretty well done.",1498608000,,268,4.32
7749522,4,B01F9QE3O8,"I've been watching a lot of horror movies lately on PRIME, and so many of them leave me thinking ""...what the heck just happened?..."".  This one has a DEFINITE ending, and I liked the surprise twist at the end.",1495756800,,210,4.384615384615385
7749523,3,B01F9QE3O8,"Mixed review here.

I hate when a movie has a great set up, a decent play through, a fanastic premise, but the acting falls flat and the ending is completely predictable. This was one of those movies that I figured out within the first ten minutes who the bad guy was, but chose to stick it out because the premise behind it was interesting. I love when movies try to bring science into the supernatural in a way that's unconventional but believably done.

I hate when a premise gets stepped on by some really bad acting (not all but most) and very cliche set ups and an overly predictable end.",1492041600,3,594,4.390909090909091
7749524,4,B01F9QE3O8,"YUP!  I got a good scare out of this.  Very creepy, and not cheaply done.  Some fun sci-fi gadgets and a surprise twist at the end.",1490745600,,131,3.9615384615384617
7749525,2,B01F9QE3O8,"Ghosthunters is about a group whom enter an abandoned house where a killer once tortured and murdered victims. Two of which where a guys wife and kid, now a few years later he and a team of Ghosthunters are going back to the house with some technology they beleive theoretically will capture ghosts and turn them into ectoplasm for scientific research and hope to find the mans wife and daughters spirit.

Now take everything you just imagined having read that, and forget what you might expect. It's not Ghostbusters, it's not a hand held or found footage thing and there is a major plot twist to the whole thing. One that I predicted early on, so I suppose many probably see it coming a mile away, too. It's not exactly a clever movie at all, yet it is certainly not the worst horror movie I have seen, but it was filled with a lot of unanswered questions, useless scenes obviously added to get at least a 90 minute film completed, even if it meant stuffing up the movies plot completely.

It's not scary, has no memorable kills, dialog or acting worth paying much attention to. But even with that said, it wasn't boring, it has a couple of half decent visual effects and none of the characters have you screaming out for them to be killed off already because they're so obnoxiously stupid. However, I won't go into spoilers, but do expect the typical running back upstairs in times of danger cliche.

It's ok for one viewing, I wouldn't buy it, nor have any intention to ever watch it again or recommend it to anyone. But if a haunted house with ghosts and a team of investigators and a serial killer interests you, well, like I said, it's ok for one viewing, it just doesn't have any replay value at all.",1490140800,,1708,4.485530546623794

The plot of this movie was almost good, but it turned to complete crap when you realize what the twist is, which I predicted from the first scene, hoping I was incorrect. The reason I gave it two stars instead of just one is that there are some great creepy parts in this movie, some really skin crawling moments. The problem is they are not much connected to the plot. The acting is also terrible. Absolutely freaking terrible. So, the moment of truth: are the good creepy bits worth sitting through the whole film for? To answer that, ask yourself how bored you are and how long you've been looking for a scary movie today. Check out Bad Ben, it's a WHOLE lot better.",1476921600,,792,4.394557823129252

As my daughter pointed out, the professional reviewers often don't seem to look for the same things that the rest of us do. She figured this movie would surely rate much higher than what they gave it. After watching from beginning to end, we both sided with IMDB. Yes, there is a twist, that wasn't obvious, but only because it is so extreme as to be very highly unlikely. I like that this Ghost Hunters purports to actually do some scientific paranormal investigation, as opposed to all the TV shows that call anything scientific, simply because it runs on electricity. But, assuming they were actually at a level to do the sort of research they discuss, we would already know so much more about the afterlife than we can reasonably hope to learn in the next hundred years. It all takes so much of a leap over where things are now that if almost could be called science fiction-y. There is a lot of 'people wandering off by themselves despite the danger' and someone seeing an 'entity' and then saying nothing about it or waiting for 5 minutes to tell anyone, that it is just hard to take it at all seriously, though it tries to come across that way. The movie is ok, but with a little work, could have been so much better.

This movie borrows heavily from a lot of films, including Ghostbusters, The Legend of Hell House, and 13 Ghosts.  But I didn't have a problem suspending my belief in those films.  In this one, well, I felt like the tech jargon was really stretching things.  Also, as people have previously stated, the villain is obvious from the start.  There's a lot of loose ends as well.  And how is putting his wife and daughter in a test tube a better alternative to having them in the house?  Are they practicing 'catch and release' here?

Even had a few scares. The plot was kind of jacked, but what else is new. Only a few complaints about the props. Why did they only have one set of spectral spectacles, (which were ripoffs of Johnny Depp's in Sleepy Hollow)?

If it says Asylum, I'm going to enjoy it. If you want an awesome, oscar winning movie, then go to the theater and don't expect to see it for free on Prime unless it's 25 years old.
