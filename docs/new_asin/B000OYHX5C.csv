2806234,3,B000OYHX5C,"I love the Yoga Booty Ballet workouts.  I could not get the moves at first but after a few weeks everything clicked.  I love to dance.

What i like best about the workouts is that you don't do the same moves everyday.  They mix up the workouts.  One day your working out with the squishy ball, anotehr day with bands.

Cons:  I am not a yoga fan.  They start off each workout doing like ten minutes of meditation.  That part is boring and I usually end up fast forwarding to the workout.  You may need to supplement a little of your own cardio in addition to the workouts because after you fast forward the meditation parts the workouts usually range from 15 minutes to 35 minutes.

Pros:  Great music, love the dancing, routines are unique, and you get in a great stretch.",1293321600,,773,4.366197183098592
2806235,5,B000OYHX5C,this is high energy peppy very fun dance/exercise dvd. i've done it several times now and i'm still not bored and it's fun to emprove your style.,1238112000,2,145,4.407407407407407
2806286,4,B000OYHX5C,"This workout video is a great way to start my day. YBB Hip Hop and Abs is actually much more cardio that Cardio Cabaret.  I will be honest, it does not make me sweat or ""feel the burn"" but it is a nice way to get my energy up for the day and I will continue working out with the videos in addition to other exercise.",1383004800,,316,3.787878787878788
2806287,5,B000OYHX5C,"I bought this because it was so cheap and it sounded fun.  I never received this DVD set... I received a single disk that is by the same people, but it was so great that I kept it.  The music and hosts are a bit cheesy, and I would be embarrassed to use the DVD in front of others, but the actual workout is very good.  There are a lot of plies, some work with light weights, stretches, and some yoga thrown in.  I did the workout 1-2 times per week and saw results.  The hosts claim you could do these moves in the club, but they are best done in the privacy of home, with a sense of humor.",1379894400,2,591,3.8916666666666666
2806288,4,B000OYHX5C,"I worked out from this DVD leas than 24 hours of receiving it & was surprised at how quickly I worked up a sweat which I loved!  I like the spirituality & personality of the instructors who keep you moving.  Although I found the ballet portion somewhat difficult, I am determined to master the moves to keep up with the routine.  I like these DVDs & will use them on a regular basis.",1369440000,2,383,4.219178082191781
2806289,2,B000OYHX5C,"I was really excited to get this workout video for a good price. I absolutely love Beach Body productions. This was a total disappointment. This is incredible cheesy, and I couldn't do more than the first five minutes of Yoga Booty Ballet before I switched this DVD for my Turbo Jam.",1363219200,,283,4.568627450980392
2806290,5,B000OYHX5C,"I love my YBB workouts. Gillian and Teigh are very funny and they know what they are talking about.  They do cardio workouts through dance so if you don't like dancing, buy something else.  They also do lots of YOGA and start and end each session with meditation which is relaxing and helpful for focusing. They have many DVDs and I own most of them.  I really enjoy this also because they don't have workouts longer than 40/45 minutes which is nice when you're short on time.",1362700800,2,476,4.448275862068965
2806291,5,B000OYHX5C,Fun workout! Variety! I just love t and guillan! They know how to work it and keep you motivated to keep moving!,1360627200,,112,4.136363636363637

2806293,5,B000OYHX5C,"I LOVE this workout! Its a great blend of yoga,ballet,& fun cardio moves. Moves can easily be modified for your skill level.",1346198400,,124,4.681818181818182
2806294,4,B000OYHX5C,"With the two disc set you get both Hip Hop Abs and Cardio Cabaret. Each start with a yoga section, and you immediately learn the instructors are quite spiritual and in tune with themselves.

Hip Hop abs is a fun routine, and will have you sweating ten times more than Cardio Cabaret, which is less cardio and more flirty little jazz moves. Both routines are great fun, but are inappropriately labeled. Hip Hop abs will get your heart rate up further and give you more of a fat burn, but is very light on ""hip hop"". Cardio cabaret doesn't elevate the heart enough, but is a fun little routine.

The end of hip hop abs is an abs routine on the mat, which I really enjoy. Cabaret ends with a ballet portion that I find difficult because it requires lots of balance and coordination.

Overall I really like these dvds and they are so fun I don't realize how fast time is going. Before you know it you're done with the workout and feeling great!",1325980800,3,940,4.36
2806295,3,B000OYHX5C,"This is just okay, it comes with 2 DVDs so it is a bargain but it is super cheesy. I can't bring myself to do these videos in front of or with anyone because I feel ridiculous. I don't mind doing them when I am at home along though. There are some really hokey parts that I typically skip that aren't vital to the cardio but I use it from time to time to mix up Tae-Bo and Zumba. Overall, not bad, just know going into it that it is silly in some parts.",1314057600,3,453,3.8297872340425534

8187662,3,B000OYHX5C,This would be a fun workout for someone who has at least some sense of rhythm. I have zero background in dance and I found it both comical and frustrating to try to master the moves. I finally just gave up and sat down and watched the instructors having a fun time. I never watched it again because I knew it would be pointless for me to try.,1427760000,,342,4.044117647058823

8187667,5,B000OYHX5C,"Good mix of workout. Has some complicated steps to get used to at the beginning, but that means I stick with it longer. If they are too easy, I get bored after the second or third time watching a DVD.

GREAT FUN!",1392249600,2,212,4.0476190476190474
8187668,3,B000OYHX5C,I love the energy! It's fun the entire time and I almost forgot I was working out. The only downfall is doing it over and over again. My body needs change. I switch it up by lifting weights once a week. They definitely get me sweating. It's kinda difficult to follow the first few times. There should be more intstruction.,1384646400,2,322,4.383333333333334
