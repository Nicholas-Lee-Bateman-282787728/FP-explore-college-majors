8678826,5,B00NLF296O,"Love this especially because I cannot get this channel as it is a Direct TV exclusive. Finally shows geared toward ""BABIES"" - Sprout programs are too mature for the first twelve months as are Disney Junior, Nick Jr. etc.",1485993600,,220,4.666666666666667

8678835,5,B00NLF296O,"We love Baby First TV in our home...especially VocabuLarry!  Our 2 year old is autistic and Larry( or ""Arry"" as he calls him) is the first stuffed animal our son could identify and go get when you asked him to!  That has happened in the last six weeks and is a very very big deal....So Larry now goes with us everywhere and we watch Larry on all our trips...even just to the grocery store!  I love hearing my lil mans voice after 27 months trying to repeat Larry!  Thank You Baby First tv",1432512000,2,488,4.21505376344086
