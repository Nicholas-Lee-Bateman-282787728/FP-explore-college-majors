1398521,5,B000056MO0,"The perfect boyband with a little bit of everyone in an everyday boy band Chad the shy one, Doug the older brother type, QT the cute younger one, Jerry the heartthrob, and micky the bad boy make the great movie/band 2gether. Watch as these boys start there journy to fame with their manager bob buss. This play on all boybands movie will make you laugh hysterically.

1398524,5,B000056MO0,I didn't buy this movie but I saw it on tv.  When I first saw this movie I immediately fell in love with QT. It was especially hilarious when he had to make out with his hand.  I definetely recommend this to girls who just want to have a good fun slumber party or to watch when you are really sad.  I gaurantee it will put a smile on your face!,980035200,2,344,3.816901408450704
1398525,5,B000056MO0,"I love this movie.  It is one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen, and I have been wanting a copy of it for years but have been unable to find it.  If anybody has a copy, or can possibly make me a copy of a tape or dvd that they have I would really appreciate it.  I am not looking for a hand-out, I am just looking for some way that I can possibly purchase this movie.  (...)",1121904000,2,384,3.7037037037037037
1398526,5,B000056MO0,"This is a very funny movie, but since it's out of print it's very hard to find.  I found mine on Amazon's Canadian website by searching for it as ""2ge+ther"" (use addition sign instead of t).  Good luck finding it!",1093478400,5,213,4.3
1398527,5,B000056MO0,"2Gether is a hysterical movie that combines music, humor, and sterotypical events into one. I suggest this movie to those whom dislike real boy bands, and to those who need/love a good laugh.",1053475200,,191,4.818181818181818
1398528,4,B000056MO0,"This was one of MTV's best movies to date, along with Joe's Apartment.  MTV basically demonstrates how the typical boy band is put together and then marketed, all the while spoofing several existing and/or now defunct groups with their comic twist.  The late Michael Cuccione, who played QT (Cutie) the band member who was dying from a mysterious illness, did ironically die of cancer a short while after MTV began running its TV series 2Gether after the movie of the same name.
The humor was great and I never missed an episode of the series.  The pilot however, remains the best of the 2Gether genre, and is therefore a must have for every collection.",1053388800,,653,4.7105263157894735
1398529,5,B000056MO0,"This movie is so awsome! I loved it when I first saw it on MTV. It is so funny and the characters are so hilarious! Evan Farmer, Noah Bastian, Kevin Farley, Alex Solowitz, and Michael Cuccione gave a spectacular performance in this movie. My favorite character is QT, and if you watch this movie, I bet you could find out which one is your favorite too. So get this movie and you will experience the world of boy bands. This movie and the band 2gether will always be my favorite of all time, because (Quoted by Michael Cuccione) ""There are many boy bands, but none like 2gether.""",1021075200,,579,4.420560747663552
1398530,5,B000056MO0,"This movie is all about the hotties of 2ge+her. Their music is awesome and their personalitys are hilarios! Mickey Parke aka Alex Solowitz is the bad boy rebel type and he is so stupid and funny. He is also very hot.then there's Chad Linus aka Noah Bastian the shy one. He is so adorable and incredibly funny. Then there is Doug Linus aka Kevan Farley the reasuring older brother type,he is Chad's brother and is pretty old looking! then there's QT aka Michael Cuccione the cute one. He plays the obsessed with girls one and he is pretty funny.then of course there is Jerry aka Evan Farmer the heartthrob. I think this movie is so cool so you should get it!!!",1015459200,,659,4.454545454545454
1398531,5,B000056MO0,"This is such a great movie! It takes all the stereotypes you've ever heard about boy bands and turns it into a hilarious movie! Even if you're not a fan of boy bands, it might be better because it totally makes fun of aspect of being in a boy band! I saw this movie on MTV and loved it and I'm so excited about it being on video! A great movie for boy band fans and anti-fans alike! I love Noah Bastian (AKA ""Chad Linus)! He's SO hot! So, give it a chance, what've you got to loose? Lata Y'all!",1005436800,2,494,3.95
1398532,5,B000056MO0,"I love 2gether. The spoof boyband music group, TV show, movie, etc. is great! But I was so sad when in real life Michael Cuccione died at 16. He was 15 before, but he had his 16th birthday in the hospital. I was mourning for ages. He was such a sweet guy. Anyway, in this movie he proves his talents as a young, charming, and witty actor. This movie is great! He is great! Also, the ""Wooaah!"", band was funny. I love this movie! Michael Cuccione was a wonderful person, and I will miss him forver!",999302400,5,497,4.1875
1398533,5,B000056MO0,"I love this movie so much.  I never saw the whole video when it first came out on TV here in Canada so I couldn't wait to buy it.  I love the music video and the interview from TRL and just interviews from the cast that's at the end of the movie.  I just have to say Michael is such a QT in this movie, then again he's always a QT.",996192000,,331,3.6338028169014085
1398534,5,B000056MO0,"I saw this movie when it was first shown on MTV! I thought it was really funny, and then guys were all cute. (RIP Michael Cuccione! I love you) this movie is one that will keep you laughing, smiling, and crying.!!!",993254400,,214,4.2439024390243905
1398535,5,B000056MO0,"I love this movie soo much. When I first heard about 2gether, I wasn't sure about them. I thought this would be just another boy band, but boy was I wrong. I know that if you buy the movie you won't be dissapointed.",993081600,,215,4.023255813953488
1398536,5,B000056MO0,"This movie is heartwarming.  It's basically about Bob Buss, who is a record producer getting Jerry O'Keefe, Mickey Parke, Q.T. McKnight, and Chad and Doug Linus ""2gether"" to form a boy band and prove his former band ""Whoa!"" (who fired him) lip syncs!  You will not be able to stop laughing, the guys are all amazing actors, and it is hands down the best movie.  Shows a lot of parodies in American culture.  I admit I cried a couple times, when Jerry left his girlfriend Erin for the band, but that's okay.  This is a great movie, and I think any one and everyone would love it!  A must have for any 2gether fan!  2gether 4ever!",992908800,,628,4.362068965517241
1398537,5,B000056MO0,"The movie 2 Ge+her is an unbeliveable story of a manager that has been rejected by an NSync type band, whoa!, that in fact lip-syncs, and now he(the manager/aka Bob Buss) is searching the east coast for 5 members to star in his new boyband, wich will open for Whoa! at a giant concert. He first picks up Jerry O'Keefe, played by actor/singer Evan Farmer(for more on Evan go to EvanFarmer.cc), who is an unbeliveable singer, that is also really hot. He is dubded the boyband's heartthrob. Next Bob picks up the shy type, and the older brother figure at the Mr. New York pageant where Chad Linus, played by amazing actor/singer Noah Dale Bastian(for more on Noah go to Noahsmom.com), is competing in the contest. Shy and naiive Chad wins Bob's heart, but Chad won't go with Bob unless his older brother Doug Linus, played by actor Kevin Farley(for more on Kevin got to kevinFarley.net), comes with. Bob is delighted to add the two new members of the budding band. So far we have a Heartthrob, The Shy one, The older brother type, and next Bob ventures to a skate park where he is determined to find the Rebel type. After a long search of boys at the park, Bob finds Mickey Parke, played by actor/singer Alex Solowitz(for more on Alex go to TheAlexObsession.net), who will only join the band if he is beat in an arm-wrestling match against Jerry. Jerry wins, and Mickey (who refers to himself as a pimp throughtout the movie) is part of the boyband. With one member missing from the boybanf formula, and the deadline for opening at the Whoa! concert creeping up, Bob becomes a little Freaked out, untill he finds a breakthrough actor/singer. He finds Jason ""Q.T."" McNight, late actor/singer Michael Cuccione(for more on Michael go to makethedifference.net,Michael's charity foundation) at a kareoke bar, seranading a group of girls. Michael is the ""dewey-eyed youngster"" who dreams of being loved by thousands of screaming girls. The boys have one thing left, that is the most cruciall part in becoming the band. Training and a name. They decide on 2 Ge+her after a long debate(and Chad being hillarious with name contributions such as ""Matchbox 30"" and 5Ge+her). The boys go through rigorous training, and later that week go on to do their first preformance at a spelling bee. When that is a failure, the boys have nothing left in their spirits. They start to break up. Bob is filled with saddness. If you wanna find out what happens in the end, like if the falling apart boyband makes it to the Whoa! concert, or if Whoa! is ever defeated for being a lip-syncing, mean band, then buy the movie!!! It's really good, and no mater how many times you watch it, it will always get you laughing!!! Even if this wasn't a real review, and more like a description of the movie, i enjoyed writting it, and i hope you enjoy the show!!!",992217600,5,2823,4.659318637274549

if you like this movie, you wil need the 2gether soundtrack and 2gether again. You also might want to order ""There are survivors"" by the late Michael Cuccione (also on Amazon.com) He also has a CD the he recorded before his death, but it it exclusively available on his website (makingadifference.org/index2.html) all the proceeds go to cancer research. thanks for reading this.",984528000,3,649,4.6521739130434785

It is a mock boyband, so it gets a little crazy. Itincludes this ""Dream Maker"" guy named Bob Buss who putsbands together. He is on his way to Jacksonville to open for his oldband Whoa! and he has to find a boyband on the way=a rebel, aheartthrob, a cute guy, a shy guy, and the older brother type. Thoseare the five types in any successful boyband, Bob says.  Anyway, thismovie is GREAT. Still don't believe me?  It includes the shy guy stuckin a fatguy suit while he falls off stage...it's great.

7932286,5,B000056MO0,"2gether was a boyband spoof movie that I couldn't get enough of. I didn't come hear to review it, I came here for answers. Why is it impossible to find this movie? I taped it with my vcr over a decade ago and watched it all the time but i haven't seen it in years. I cant find it anywhere and people have the nerve to be selling ""like new"" ""acceptable condition"" ""light scratches"" for rates between $94 and $200. what is the meaning of this price gauging?! this is an outrage! LMAO this was a mtv made for tv movie. I am far from cheap but i would rather go to the attic of my hoarder parents house and sift through the thousands of tapes and god knows what else to find it and play it in one of the 6 vcrs i know they have just not where and distribute it to the masses on principle alone. I just wanted to revisit my youth. its sick how the technology over the years from vcr to dvd to blu ray to streaming has just made it less and less convinient to own a movie. no more dvrs barely use my dvd . Its disgusting . Its like they are letting the movie die!",1363564800,,1057,3.94392523364486

I can't believe how much people are selling it for, it's insane. I bought this on DVD back in 2002 for 13 bucks brand new, thank goodness cuz there's no way I would pay a hundred or more for it now.",1320969600,,323,3.909090909090909
7932288,5,B000056MO0,"Funny movie.  Out of print so you will likely overpay for it.  If you watch Amazon or eBay i've seen it go for as low as $67 (on DVD, VHS I wouldn't pay more than $25-30...check eBay).  This was MTV's first made for TV movie and came out when they were still releasing movies on both VHS and DVD.  Same type of humor (I think) as Dumb and Dumber, but without the talent of Jim Carey.  If you were into or grew up with MTV during the Backstreet/'Nsync/98 degrees years...you will probably find this funny.  I think the case says ""Spinal Tap for boy bands"", i think thats a fair description as long as your keep in mind its only an hour long and it was played on MTV.",1299024000,,665,4.116279069767442
7932289,5,B000056MO0,This was one of my favorite movies/t.v. shows as a kid. I lived through the whole boy band era so this parody was hilarious. It's really upsetting that they don't show re-runs or sell copies any more. Can anyone get me a cheaper copy?,1297555200,,234,4.340909090909091
