7823889,5,6302263263,I had never caned before in my life and took this video out from the library.  I caned an antique chair I found at a yard sale and it came out GREAT!  I want a copy of this video for my own.  Hope it becomes available again soon.,1153872000,,229,3.7291666666666665
7823890,5,6302263263,"I cane chairs and checked this video out of the local library to see if I could learn some new tricks.  I did.  Jane Nelson demonstrates the right way and wrong way to cane.  Some books discuss creating ""X's"" at the edges but Jane Nelson shows one how to get this effect even when the hole spacing might be less than ideal. Her demonstration of finishing the bottom should be watched by many caners who leave the bottom unfinished because it cannot be seen.
Her demonstration of applying prewoven cane is better than I was taught or I have read.
This video is worth every penny if one wants to learn to cane.",1049673600,,608,4.3628318584070795
