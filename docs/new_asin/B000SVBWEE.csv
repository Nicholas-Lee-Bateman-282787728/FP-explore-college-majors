8206943,4,B000SVBWEE,I enjoyed these lectures.  The professor is very likable and has a desire to make the subject of Calculus understandable to the non-mathematician.  If you like mathematics you will enjoy the lectures.  He presents the lessons in interesting ways.,1376956800,,246,5.256410256410256
8206944,5,B000SVBWEE,"Dr. Michael Starbird is a fabulous instructor, who obviously understands his subject matter thoroughly, and is delighted to explain it to you; his course makes perfect intuitive sense. I have the VHS version, so rewinding to go over a difficult concept is a little tough, but it's out on DVD; that might be a better option for subject matter such as this. I think you'll find Dr. Starbird a delightful fellow, full of surprises. He has a very breezy style, which nevertheless can't disguise his profound understanding of this subject, and his obvious delight doing it.

It appears that Amazon won't allow you to get on with your day, unless you mention them. OK, I bought it at Amazon.",1345680000,,685,4.756302521008403
8206945,1,B000SVBWEE,"While Professor Starbird seems very personable, I am glad I never had him for an instructor.  He takes an hour to explain what could be explained in 5 minutes.  His use of graphics (which is a must to understand calculus) is severely lacking until about half way through the course.  Students would be much better off using Dana Mosely  DVD's (calc and precalc).  I have used Dana Mosely's DVD's (which follow Larson's Calculus text edition 8th and 9th) for Calc I/II/III/IV and they were a big help.",1290124800,10,500,4.7011494252873565
8206946,3,B000SVBWEE,"I did enjoy the series, but it was probably more due to the delightfully unassuming personality and shy charm of the instructor, Professor Starbird.  I attempted with only very moderate success a couple of calculus courses, but never ever felt that I understood what I was doing.  At least Professor Starbird's statement to the effect that many used the system without ever understanding it made me feel a little better.  Unfortunately I'm one of those people who really needs to understand a process in order to apply it.  So what I did learn of calculus I really understand well.  Unfortunately at some point there are so many pieces balanced on other pieces that one end up suspecting that one is trying to think around corners.  In the end I feel lost and frustrated.  While I don't know that I've made great strides in understanding the mathematics of calculus with this series, what I do know has been refreshed and updated.

There is nothing of the Discovery Channel type media about it.  The course might help out a student new to the topic to prepare for a formal course on it by virtue of the visual material presented, but I still think it'll be a matter of digging out the concepts and learning to apply them.  In the end when it comes to tests, it'll still probably be all about memorizing the formula and how to come up with them.",1284768000,6,2156,6.25
