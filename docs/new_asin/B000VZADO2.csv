2958468,1,B000VZADO2,"In case anyone is wondering what the worst Christmas movie of all time is, A Christmas Too Many is certainly in the running.  It actually has a pretty good cast, which may fool some people into buying it (it certainly fooled me), but don't do it!  This has to be the most pointless, banal, mean-spirited and foul-mouthed ""Christmas"" movie ever, & everyone even remotely involved in it's creation should be ashamed of themselves.  (ie, Mickey Rooney took his awful character from A Night At The Museum a few steps further).  It's most definitely a ""no-star"" rating-Amazon should give us that choice, as there are many movies out there that deserve it, especially this one.  Aargghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!",1198108800,26,696,5.017391304347826
2958469,1,B000VZADO2,"Lost the plot of the story, buyers don't make the same mistake I did.
Don't buy this.",1196985600,5,85,4.0588235294117645
2958470,1,B000VZADO2,"I ordered this dvd mainly because I have always been partial to Mickey Rooney. Although I suppose this movie could be considered funny, I fail to see why all the swearing from the start. And what's funny about someone getting a finger lopped off in a Christmas movie? Then someone else trying to sew it back on with needle and thread? Although everyone has their own tastes in comedy, this is one movie that will not be added to my Christmas movie collection but will be thrown out with the trash. The dialog is cheesy, the bits predictable and except for Mr. Rooney, the acting is mediocre at best. I find no redeeming qualities in this farce.",1164412800,,644,4.512820512820513
2958471,5,B000VZADO2,I saw this at the Reno Film festival a year or so back. It's probably one of the funniest and most unexpected comedies you'll ever see. Mickey Rooney is great as the grandfather but it's Greg Joelson as Teddy and Gary Coleman in a cameo that steal the show. It's a real treat and deserves to be seen over and over!!!,1142294400,,316,4.19672131147541
2958472,1,B000VZADO2,"Well, despite the negative reviews, I had high hopes for this film because I love Mickey Rooney.  But it's so bad that I'm embarrassed for him that he's even in it.  And I'm very sad that this was one of Gary Coleman's last roles.  What a terrible way to be remembered.  'A Christmas Too Many' indeed... this movie is one MINUTE too many!!! UFFDA it's terrible!!!!",1353801600,2,364,4.46969696969697
2958473,1,B000VZADO2,"Rented this movie from amazon instant video, and didn't like it at all. I should have gone with the reviews, if a movie has only 2 stars don't buy it. Worst movie i've ever seen.",1333152000,2,178,4.114285714285714
2958474,5,B000VZADO2,"If you are a fan of offbeat holiday comedies this movie will not disappoint. It is crazy, dirty, and funny as heck. It made my wife laugh out loud and she was in a bad mood. Really bad. We're buying a copy for us and one as a gift to grandma cause she'll love it too. It's part Meet the Parents/Fokkers and part Griswold's Christmas dinner, with a Gary Coleman chaser. This movie will be in our holiday rotation from now on.
 If you are looking for Oscar performances, or sappy holiday sentiment, look elsewhere.",1323561600,,512,4.389473684210526
2958475,5,B000VZADO2,this product was everything that i hoped it would be so thank you for the swift and easy transaction. the product got to me in a reasonable fashion.,1323302400,,148,4.321428571428571
2958476,1,B000VZADO2,"I like the others, bought this because it was inexpensive and has people in the cast I know and like. This move is truly wretched.  It tries for cynical laughs but can't get them, It rips off National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation but hasn't a shred of the things that gave that movie humor and warmth, and then rips off Weekend with Bernie for good measure.  If you feel you absolutely must see it, rent it so you won't be stuck owning it after you turn it off halfway through!",1292284800,3,477,4.348314606741573
2958477,1,B000VZADO2,"I agree with everyone else who said this movie is bad...because TRUST ME...we are not wrong. I'm a sucker for christmas movies and own a ton of them so I bought this dvd being it was only $5. But that was a bad decision..this movie is absolutely pointless and just plain awful. It is not only the worst christmas movie I've ever seen, but the worst movie in general. I literally shut it off after 20 minutes and threw it out. Please please please do not waste money on this dvd!!!",1258156800,10,480,4.285714285714286
2958478,1,B000VZADO2,I have seen Jr. High Students give better performances than this..I never knew Mickey Rooney could be so bad...I want to meet the salesman who sold this turkey to some stupid producer...Turned it off after 45 minutes and broke it in two....,1222992000,7,240,4.738095238095238
2958479,1,B000VZADO2,"This has to be the worst film I've ever seen.  I've seen film school projects that beat the heck out of this!  Horrible writing, bad timing, ridiculous subplots...the list goes on.  It may have been an idea that could have worked had it been done with good acting, cohesiveness, and a decent script.  There's no way anyone can get emotionally connected to ANY of these characters.  It just doesn't work.  A true bomb that could be used as a weapon!",1208131200,6,448,4.5375
2958480,1,B000VZADO2,I received the product within the specified time period.  The movie itself is boring and the acting is forced.  I cannot recommend this movie.,1200528000,3,142,4.875
2958481,3,B000VZADO2,I bought this movie because I heard good reviews about it. I wasn't expecting much from it. But surprisingly the movie is actually funny besides some of the strong language. It's somewhat low budget and it reminds of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation in a way. I would absolutely recommend this movie.,1198195200,2,305,5.0

8220552,3,B000VZADO2,Nice change of pace from the average Hallmark Movie.  There is some laugh out loud moments that a less talented cast could not pull off,1506729600,,135,4.4
8220553,1,B000VZADO2,Utter waste of time. Don't bother even if it's free! Terrible plot if you can call it a plot. Terrible acting. Terrible all around.,1387324800,,131,4.5

8220559,1,B000VZADO2,Turned it off after about 10 minutes.  No Christmas movie should EVER have the F-bomb in it especially one this horrible.  That's 10 minutes I'll never get back.,1354406400,,161,4.714285714285714
8220560,1,B000VZADO2,This is my first review on amazon. Believe me this is the worst movie I have ever seen the acting is so bad. When I read the reviews I thought it cant be that bad.
