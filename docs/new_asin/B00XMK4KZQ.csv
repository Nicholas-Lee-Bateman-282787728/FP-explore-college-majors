8716313,1,B00XMK4KZQ,"The only HORROR part is how HORRIBLE this collection is! And Echo Bridge tricks buyers by using a Jurassic-like photo. DISHONEST. If I was still 17 years old and stoned, this MIGHT be funny.",1512345600,,190,4.617647058823529
8716314,4,B00XMK4KZQ,"Vintage Sci-Fi B-movies. Good acting, good scripts, sometimes laughable special effects. These movies are family films with little or nothing to scare anyone. Enjoy on some rainy day. It can keep the family or just the children occupied while home for the summer.",1466294400,,263,5.1395348837209305
8716315,4,B00XMK4KZQ,The cover is a little misleading. A lot misleading. These are old movies but I enjoyed them. The only one that does not really fit is Piranha.  Not a horror or Sci-Fi movie. An action adventure film.,1454544000,,199,4.378378378378378

Love,

8716318,4,B00XMK4KZQ,"For the price, it's a fairly good deal...and while the quality of the movies varies from good to better, don't expect any 'restored' versions of the 7 movies.  Still, it's worth the price!",1443916800,4,188,4.696969696969697

8716321,1,B00XMK4KZQ,Didn't like wasn't what I thought I was getting,1441929600,3,47,4.333333333333333
8716322,2,B00XMK4KZQ,"Basically, you get seven horror b movies which are poor blurry transfers from VHS tapes. The movies are ""Creature"", ""Attack Of The Giant Leeches"", ""The Giant Gila Monster"", ""The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues"", ""The Killer Shrews"", ""Piranha"" (This is not the Joe Dante cult classic ""Piranha"") and ""Voyage To The Prehistoric Planet"".  The first five movies are crammed onto the first dvd and the last two on the second dvd. I paid under four bucks at Walmart for mine and to be honest that's all this collection is worth. Next time I'll know better and stay away from any dvd released by Echo Bridge.",1438732800,9,596,4.730769230769231
