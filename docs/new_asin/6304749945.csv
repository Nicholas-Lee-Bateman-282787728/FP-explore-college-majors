When it finally  did I realized my VHS player wasn't working, I mean after all,these man-made machines also referred to as CONSUMABLES  were designed with a reasonably short lifespan well short enough that you would have to buy another one before you die anyways. So my anxiety to view the tape had to be suspended until I could find a willing subject with a working VHS player and who was also willing to lend me it to digitize the tape ( meaning to transfer it to a computer and then to dvd) so I could view this in the luxury of my living room sigh. in the middle of the digitizing process it dawned on me why oh why didn't these publishers transfer this to DVD in the first place. Treasure like this should not be left to wither away on some measly VHS tape whose fate is already sealed. They're probably too busy making money with what passes for popular music toady. Having finished the digitizing process I realized some of the tracks were titled incorrectly on the case as well as one or two of the songs like ""oh when the saints"" are not even mentioned on the case. Also the picture on the front could be misleading as it portrays a younger AL Hirt and gives the impression that you're getting a sample of Jumbo in his hey day however this is not the case in the video AL is much older it looks like it was made in the early 90's

ANyway all that aside

I was spirited away to the heart of Bourbon street and became a patron of the club and got to hear and see Al and his combo perform live. For someone living in the caribbean this was a truly dream come through. As a ""young man with a horn"" it was my dream to meet Al in person sadly he passed before I had a chance to do so.. hence the reason this footage is invaluable to me. Al performs every number with all that he is and its easy to see he enjoyed what he did. His interaction with the audience shows a side of him that I could not imagine or visualize listening to his many recordings. His skilled team also did a fantastic job at entertaining and supporting Al.

Spoiler Alert !!! Im not to certain but during one of the songs I believe Al's wife, Beverly Hirt could be seen leading the audience in a Mardi Grasesque parade through the club...I could be wrong as I've only seen her in available photos online

I recommend this video to any Fan of Al hirt (which should be every trumpet player on the planet) but be warned unless you have access to a vhs player or know what a VHS player is. Be prepared to digitize this baby if you want it to last",1290124800,,2646,4.166340508806262
8275065,5,6304749945,Al Hirt is a Wonderful Musician and I would love to see him on this $5 video tape.  Unfortunately all of the current sellers are on crack.  There are no video tapes on this planet worth $75 to $100 dollars.  Most are worthless. Attention pet dogs please bite these sellers on the their ankles. Thanks!,1214352000,3,301,4.4363636363636365
