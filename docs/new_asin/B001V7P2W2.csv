3818905,5,B001V7P2W2,"I have a fear of heights.

I also have a new fear of being stranded on the side of a sheer cliff called ""The Murder Wall"" during a blizzard.  This unexpected thriller, based on a true story, held me spellbound for it's just over two hour running time.  I can't recall a more harrowing mountain adventure.

This riveting recreation is set in 1936, a short time before the famed (and notorious) Berlin Olympics which Hitler hoped to use as propaganda to tout the superiority of all things Nazi and Aryan.  The worldwide news of Germans conquering this impossible, peak was a hoped-for event before the Olympics and something encouraged by the German press.  Here two Germans -- Toni Kurz and Andreas Hinterstoisser -- confront ""the last problem of the Alps"": the Eiger's unclimbed North Face.  They are closely followed up ""The Murder Wall"" by a competing Austrian team.  But things go terribly wrong.  The crowds and the press watch the ensuing, heart-stopping drama through telescopes from the inn and chalets below.

 A terrible point of no return is reached.  Under unimaginable conditions, the men fight for survival, trying to do what's right when everything's gone wrong.  This extraordinary drama does not relent.  It held me in a freezing visceral grip.  I was on the mountain with these men and never once felt that it was anything less than real.  If you have a need to climb the Eiger, please make note of the Hinterstoisser Traverse.  Director Philipp Stoelzl superbly captures the dangers, the daring and the tragedy.",1274054400,84,1529,4.88715953307393
3818906,2,B001V7P2W2,"Having read The White Spider by Heinrich Harrer and hearing the book was used in the making of the film, I was very excited to see Nord Wand and I couldn't wait for the film to be released in America. However, when I finally got the movie and the 2 hours of the film rolled by, I was disappointed.

The climbers are portrayed as competitors who hate each other and climb for glory rather than for love of climbing and love of the mountain. This is exactly the opposite of how they behave in The White Spider, which is an historically accurate account written by a man who was part of the 4-man team that climbed the Face for the first time in 1938. What was most incredible to me was how the Austrian team was shamelessly portrayed as a pair of selfish men whose lust for glory caused the tragedy of 1936, which is an outright lie that slanders two men of climbing history.

The dreary, competitive, unfriendly spirit between the climbers is the exact same mood as in The Eiger Sanction, which is a silly (but fun) Hollywood over-dramatization of alpine climbing. This is fine for a fictional piece, but for a film based on such an important event in climbing history such as this one, I would call it a travesty.

On the plus side, the technical portrayal of climbing in that period is reasonably accurate, and the film offers some visually incredible scenes high on the North Face. If you watch this movie expecting dramatization and take it as fiction, even though it is not supposed to be fiction, you will probably enjoy it. However, if you had hopes that a climbing film produced by Hollywood (or in this case its German counterpart) would finally capture the true spirit of climbing, you will be very disappointed.",1271548800,10,1721,4.54516129032258
3818907,5,B001V7P2W2,"This is an action packed film involving a mountaineering adventure, a love story, and the politics of pre-1936 Olympic Games Germany.  Pay close attention to the dialogue to catch the subtle politics emerging in the social setting at the posh hotel in the Alps.  The mountaineers make basic mistakes which result in a nailbiting climax.  The film is based on a true story and should be watched by anyone who thinks they want to climb a mountain.  I'm recommending it to all my dear mountaineering friends and relatives to remind them to plan well, climb wisely, and return home safe.",1268611200,33,583,4.8

Played flat, like a documentary, this powerful drama is also a real cliffhanger! With the German war period, the Olympics and climbing the Eiger for real and the fatherland; the film has a tapestry that works slow and cool. The subject is delivered as slick as any new Hollywood film with an honest difference.

3818912,5,B001V7P2W2,"I absolutely loved this movie and recommend it to climbers and non climbers alike.  Knowing bit about the story of Kurts and Hiterstroiser I thought they did a great job with the film, the special effects and cinematography are amazing and you feel that you are climbing the mountain with these guys, and I was at the edge of my seat.  I can live with the historical inaccuracies because this is a movie and understand that they put in the love interest so the women who are not climbers would get into the story and not commit hara kiri after a movie just about climbing.
I most of all adore the director and producers for making you feel that you are on the Eiger, not like the movie K2 where the director thought that we are all idiots and could not tell the difference between Canadian mountains and the K2 in Pakistan.",1489104000,,823,4.407894736842105

3818920,3,B001V7P2W2,"Unfortunately, stereotypical film politics took over in a brutally-stupid way in the final minutes of the film, with the attention taken COMPLETELY off of the 2 brave climbing teams. It was gratuitously-overwrought and unnecessary.

I'm not going to mince words, the death-defying climbing scenes could not possibly have been more effective. These scenes will stand the test of time in their suspenseful effectiveness. Few films have ever made me get up and start pacing due to how nervous the suspense made me. I also found the backstory of the 2 German climbers to be very catching and it was interspersed in the film very well. The set-up for the nearly-impossible climb was terrifically-paced.

As the climb begins, even a complete amateur climber like myself can begin to understand some of what it takes to scale a mountain as far as equipment, tactics, strategy, weather factors, terrain, etc. However, the lengths to which the film makers went to make the Eiger Nordwand seem like a nearly-impassable mountain face was the effective, overarching menace in the plot. I'd like to think that even seasoned and professional climbers would shudder at the thought of taking it on. The miseries of weather, uncertainty of terrain, possibility of avalanches, and long stretches of sheer flat-faced insanity confront the Austrian and German climbing teams.

Fairly early in the climb, the injuries begin mounting as the two competing teams quickly pool their resources and advance grimly up the Eiger. During this time, the romantic interest of one of the German climbers is at a nearby hotel serving as a photographer for her Berlin newspaper. She does play a part later in the film's climax, but I won't ruin the surprise.

As referenced above, the closing minutes of the film serve as stereotypical German-shaming from the film industry. Amazingly, ""North Face"" was thankfully free of this BS for the vast majority of the first 99% of the film. However, in the closing minutes, disgusted with the hard-driving gloryhound nature of her boss, the photographer tells her she is quitting and not returning to Berlin because the city is filled with people like him. The assertion is that she is somehow ""above the fray"" as the closing seconds show her photographing a (GASP!) a black jazz player in her studio in New York. Naturally, the film makers want viewers to have amnesia and forget all about US segregation, as well as the fact that Jesse Owens spoke glowingly of the friendliness of German people during the '36 Olympics, not to mention that he could sit anywhere he wanted on rail cars, eat in any restaurant he wanted to as well as stay in the finest hotel available in as nice a room as he wanted. But never mind that, let's let the film industry keep beating that anti-German drum.",1479340800,,2791,4.931914893617021

3818922,1,B001V7P2W2,"Went to Iceland with a pair of North face waterproof insulated trail boots. Arrived,  put the boots on, and as We started walking the boots were literally cracking as I was walking. I went to the lobby of the hotel, asked them for electrical tape and proceeded to tape up the front of the entire boot. As the morning progressed, the other boot started to crack. Before long, you could literally see the segregation of  the top half from the bottom half. They literally cracked around the entire shoe. When north face was called in regards to their product, customer service would do nothing for it. Didn't matter how many pictures of the boots I showed them, the answer was the same:  sorry.....",1474675200,,695,4.634146341463414

I speak German.  I purchased the film, in part, to improve my German and enjoy the spoken German and German dialects.  I purchased a version from the UK (w great service).  But this is the thing.  The studio who edited my version seems to have done everything possible to ""disgermanize"" the film.  What do I mean.  Subtitles, in English, right accross every screen with dialogue, very conspicuous, and there is no way I can turn them off!  Extra features, without any German.  If this is what you want, and perhaps the average viewer in English speaking countries wants this, then perhaps fine.  For me, annoying and disappointing.  But in the end, still a great film.

3818983,5,B001V7P2W2,"This was an intense, gripping, thrilling adventure.  Incredibly realistic mountain climbing scenes that made me feel as if I was right there with them, along with my fear of heights!  The background story is at times a little slow, but the excitement of the climbing scenes are worth it.  A truly moving, exciting film--not one to miss!

The rest of this review is going to contain spoilers, so please stop reading here.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!

I started to suspect something was amiss when the woman climbed out onto the side of the mountain and stayed there all night.  I thoroughly enjoyed the unrequited love story, but the real, true story is as heartbreaking as ever--there was no need to add a love interest.  Creating animosity between the climbers when there wasn't any is unfair to the memory of these real young men!  Further, making the Swiss mountain guides seem like they were reluctant to try to rescue them was extremely unfair--they responded as soon as they were notified and did everything they could to save them, aside from the mishap with the lost rope.  Again, unfair to tarnish the memory of real persons.

Despite these grievances, I was fascinated by this film, and the scenes on the mountain were done so well that they made me feel uncomfortable even though I was sitting squarely on my own couch in my safe and warm living room.",1401926400,3,1354,4.743589743589744
3818984,5,B001V7P2W2,What a remarkable story this is. Couldn't take my eyes away! I am ever impressed by how strong the human will can be.,1400284800,,117,4.130434782608695
3818985,4,B001V7P2W2,"This movie is absolutely the best feature narrative (i.e. non-documentary) focused on climbing/mountaineering. I won't say I've seen all the other entries in the genre, but I've probably gotten close. Nothing else can touch this film in that regard. It's gripping, the climbing generally feels authentic and realistic. The actors seem like mountaineers (this is a flaw in many other films of this nature--the actors can't sell the role of being a true mountaineer). And the locations/scenery looks, on average, pretty good (a huge contention I had with ""K2"" is that you never feel like you're actually on K2--not that I've been there, but I've read at least three books and looked at lots of pictures and videos--nor does it feel like you're really anywhere 'special').

Having said all the above, just because it's the best narrative, it's not a perfect film. Unlike other reviewers, I did feel that the love story was tacked on just for the sake of having a love story, and it took something away from the film, I feel. Regardless, this is a fine film still the same and anyone with an interest in these types of films MUST see this one.

Keep in mind that I'm not comparing this to documentaries, just feature narratives, so I'm not taking into consideration films such as THE SUMMIT or TOUCHING THE VOID... it's hard for me to compare the two different types of films and I won't attempt such here.

Bottom line, if you're into the genre this film falls under, it's a must see. Even if you're not, it's still worth considering, I feel--don't let movies like VERTICAL LIMIT sour your opinion of the genre--every now and then (very rarely though, I admit) a good mountain movie is made. And this is the best of them.",1397088000,,1718,4.72
3818986,5,B001V7P2W2,Completely gripping once the Eiger climb started in the movie. Incredibly realistic cinematography for its time regarding the climbing and climbers' appearance progressing through the climb. A must view for any hobbyist mountain climber.,1393891200,,237,6.0
3818987,5,B001V7P2W2,"Real climbers will love this movie. The mix of real climbing with CGI is so elegantly done - I've never seen anything like it before and I've seen a lot of climbing films - and I've done a lot of climbing. They needed actors who could climb to pull off a film this good, and that's what they got. I defy anyone on the first pass through the movie to pick out anything technically deficient (it helps the filmmakers that this story is set in the late 30's: climbing gear, and techniques, were very elemental).

This is a lot more than a good climbing film though.

The story this is based on is true. The filmmakers add a subplot or two as story-telling devices, but the main story is about two men and their love of the mountains and the camaraderie it takes to tackle immense challenges like the Nordwand as a team. The actors are brilliant, you feel everything they feel as they experience it, and you pull for them the minute you meet them onscreen.

Technically and emotionally the film is a major achievement. The sub-plots make It compelling for non-climbers, the climbing is superlative, and even better: it does not overly glorify the dangers of the mountains, it deals soberly with the ever-possible tragedy that mistakes on hard mountains can lead to; and I think it will help climbers to answer that great unanswerable question that non-climbers are always asking, ""Why do you do it?""

I could not recommend it enough.",1393804800,3,1429,4.6141732283464565

The characters are real and easy to care about, the danger palpable, the risks they take intelligent but insane, the mountain beautiful and the weather frightening.  Watching them work with the early last century equipment knowing the kinds of equipment they would have had today only deepens the concern and the fear.  The camaraderie that develops between two teams is uplifting.

 The contrast between the climbers' peril and  cold and the lux life of observers in the lodges below heightens the awareness of danger,  but the only drawback of that contrast is the situation with the girlfriend.  Sweet but probably unnecessary and, according to history, not even a real part of the story.",1389830400,,744,5.090909090909091

3819020,5,B001V7P2W2,"Painfully realistic and gripping account of climbing the killer Eiger's North Face circa 1930s - long before Gortex and lightweight alpine gear. The movie is historically fascinating, giving us a view of early Alpine mountaineering feats against the backdrop of rising Fascist Germany.

A German story told in German and meticulous detail of the period also lent authenticity. Only one criticism, as others reviewers have noted, the story uses real characters and real events but throws in a few ""Hollywood"" twists, such as reluctant rescuers and a love interest, that don't seem necessary.

Even if you have no experience in mountain climbing you'll appreciate the unbelievable odds and risks they took in the attempt to be the first to climb the north face of the Eiger in 1936.  It's beyond belief how they could have even considered such a climb given the state of the art of the the climbing gear back then.

3819046,4,B001V7P2W2,a good subtitled movie of hardship and determination. It is a story of prewar Germany and has just enough NAZIs in it to make it interesting.

I was absolutely convinced that Toni Kurz along with his partner Andi Hinterstoisser where claiming the Eiger. This simply means the photography is truly overwhelming fantastic. The film a is bone chilling in its drama, the story line is realistic in it's truth along with keeping me captivated throughout.

This film told me what else was going on in the world while we watched the newsreels at the movies about the Nazi regime.  Politics and propaganda gave us a very limited view about others living through the same period.  It's an exciting and educational film and I would recommend it to educators of social studies, language arts, and world language teachers.

But if you are trying to read, translate and see the action at the same time it is difficult.

3819089,5,B001V7P2W2,"This old-school style drama is a cinematic achievement that is filled with tension, drama, and heartache.  If you favor new-school action films, many of which are action montages that don't require a story line, you may want to look elsewhere.  Part of this film's success lies in its spacing.  Scenes of intense man-against-nature struggles are punctuated by the drama of a woman who is desperately trying to save them. Acting is top-notch, and the mountain scenes, which are bleak and almost monochromatic, will have your adrenaline pumping.  When they are forced to bivouac, you might find yourself shivering against the unrelenting wind and snow.  The protection gear of that period - canvas, wool, and leather, makes the cold seem even more intense. You can feel the frigid gales piercing right through it.  This film is a great ride that is best experienced with a good sound system.  A big screen is not necessary - I watched it on my Kindle fire with my Klipsch S4 ear buds and the volume cranked up, and I felt as if I was on the mountain with them.",1369526400,,1058,4.717391304347826

3819093,5,B001V7P2W2,"Deutschland has been producing some exceptional films in the past few years. Films that are every bit as expertly crafted as any american director could accomplish. Perhaps even better. Especially over the past 5 years. Being my family roots are deeply Germanic, I have seen many German films over my lifetime, and two of the best I have ever seen are this film and director Uli Edel's masterpiece, Der Baader Meinhof Komplex, the sweeping violent epic about the rise and fall of Deutschland's Red Army faction. Nordwand is a powerful suspense filled adventure based on a true story, that sadly doesnt have a happy ending. Seeing this film brought back to memory Clint Eastwood's film The Eiger Sanction, which like this movie was also actually filmed on the north face of Mount Eiger in Switzerland. During the production of Eiger Sanction, Eastwood did his own climbing and stunts. He broke his arm during a nasty fall on the mountain, and a camera man was killed on the north face when a bolder from above hit the man sending him down the mountain to his death. Eastwood had been in that very spot just 30 seconds before the tragedy. Eastwood had never been closer to his death than he was then. I wouldn't be surprised if someone actually died during the production of this film as well. Making another film on the same summit of the Eiger as Eastwood's thriller is a heroic thing to do indeed. Though the mountain climbing sequences in Clin'ts film are truly astonishing, they are far more dramatic and suspensfully daring here. This is without a doubt the best film about mountain climbing ever made. Its ultimately a tragic story, but it is masterfully intense from start to finish.",1367884800,,1689,4.7679180887372015

3819104,4,B001V7P2W2,"This is an impressive climbing movie with a throwaway romantic subplot. There's another subsubplot about Nazi propaganda, but our climbers don't care about that and neither should we.

The movie develops great visual contrasts between the suffering of the mountaineers and the comfortable life of the viewers in a luxury hotel at the bottom of the mountain. For example, when the climbers are freezing, we cut to a warm fire in the lobby.

The romantic subplot, whether historic or a creature of the director's imagination, distracts from the real story. The film loses too much energy at the newspaper in Berlin and the love interest's editor in the hotel.  We don't need this for the drama - I'd have preferred to keep the tourists more faceless, as a stand-in for all of us watching the film.

The director does an impressive job holding the pace back. Hollywood would ruin this story with quick cuts and too much editing. The Germans still know to let the action take its time, and that really builds the tension. The climbing shots are consistently amazing - kudos to the director and cinematographer.",1363737600,,1106,4.867021276595745

As a result of some other reviews, I will get ""The White Spider"" by Heinrich Harrer and ""The Beckoning Silence"" by Joe Simpson to read the gripping story.

Nice to have the visuals of climbing gear and adventure from the movie.  Too bad about the girl.

One of the best and realistic films showing the courage and the ethics of the early days of climbing.  One reviewer panned the movie for ""taking liberties"" with the facts. Every movie ""based on true events"" takes that liberty from time to time.  It in no way detracts from the quality of the film or the storyline either.  After watching this film, you will have a new perspective about mountaineers and why they do what they do.  If you climb you will identify with the emotions and motivations that drive these men.

3819137,5,B001V7P2W2,"When I was a tot in the 30's my parents regularly attended a motion picture theater in Irvington, NJ that featured German films and I remember the dramatic mountaineering films that were a common staple of that time.  When you view this DVD you will understand why.  I even remember one title, ""Gewitter im Mai"" which translates to ""Electrical Storm in May"" which was, supposedly an uncommon event and therefore extra hazardous.  I rented this DVD from Netflix and I was very surprised to experience the same thrill from this modern day version as I did years ago; I even remember the large telescopes that were set out on the viewing deck of the hotel for the guests to watch the progress of the climbers. There are a few surprises about the railway system inside the Eiger mountain that I won't reveal; you have to see this ""North Face"" DVD for white knuckle viewing and the portrayal of the fate of those early pioneers of mountaineering. Hearing them described as ""vagabonds"" in the ""Extras"" section of the DVD surprised me and I equate their reputation to that of our surfer community today.  I bought it because I'm sure I'll enjoy it again and I also plan to spring it on some future guests of ours who are in the mood for viewing something during a visit.  It's suitable for children, if you don't mind them waking from nightmares, screaming for several weeks afterwards.

3819145,3,B001V7P2W2,"This review will be useful to that segment of potential purchasers of the film who became interested in it because it is not only about a famous (though doomed) mountain-climbing expedition but also because it is (indirectly) about the Third Reich. This specific segment for which I am reviewing the film wishes to see something positive about that period in the film. (It is relevant also that I, though an American, have lived in the Alps myself, I speak both fluent High German and also Austrian alpine dialect, and I majored in German at Georgetown. Further, I have extensive mountain-hiking experience....but not in mountain ""climbing"" -- with pitons, ropes, etc., for I have never had a subliminal death wish, and when you see this film you may end up agreeing with my remark.)

It is a typical West German movie (and I say West German deliberately, because West Germany simply ate East Germany, illegally, in 1990, and imposed on the whole country obsessive anti-Nazism. Every year, in that supposed German democracy, thousands are arrested for peacefully saying anything at all positive about the period 1933-45.) And so it is ""de rigeur"" in this film (as well as all the other West German films) to consistently portray National Socialists as totally sinister, extremely uncool, and latently monstrous....just waiting to holocaust someone In this film, they add for good measure an obese, cynical, large-nosed and black-haired Jew, who criticizes the whole expedition to one and all as insanely dangerous. The Jew is shown as being the one wise man in the whole crew of Eiger onlookers.

Even the blue-eyed lead actress Wokalek is forced to wear brown contact lenses, because cool people do not look Aryan! That is how ridiculously tendentious and lecturing this film is on the one hand.

I think I should also say, without giving the ending away entirely, that it sticks to the fundamental historical facts ....at least about how the real expedition truly ended, which was in an extreme and searing tragedy. Do not expect an American-style ""happy ending"" at all, for the truth is there was no happy ending. But somehow even this ending is subtly blamed on the Third Reich, as if Hitler had pushed those men up the north face of the Eiger.... No, alpinists for decades have attempted these sorts of perilous climbs -- dreaming of testing their skill, bravery and determination under the most daunting conditions -- and they have done so without Adolf Hitler and on a regular basis. Hitler certainly did not encourage Mallory to climb Everest in the 1920s (who perished) nor Hillary in the 1950s (who succeeded). Dozens have perished on Everest or K-2, but I suppose some day we will get a film about how every man who died on those peaks also was killed by Adolf Hitler...(Just a day before this review was written, even his parents' grave in Austria was dug up at the insistence of Austrian leftists!)

On a positive note, the film ""North Face,"" reflecting the eternal German obsession with technical quality, is well-done in its breathtaking film work. You get a powerful sense of the majesty and danger of such a climb.

But if you hate Nazis (how brave of you to conform with what the media tells you from cradle to grave) and you love politically correct films where Germans are doomed for ""following Hitler,"" and you welcome blue-eyed people getting brown contact lenses inserted in their eyeballs so as to avoid looking Aryan, then, for you, I would give the film four stars. Then you will like this film, and be subtly happy that it ended in a disaster.",1333065600,6,3570,4.855500821018063

Was it a freak of nature?  Well, anyway, I was riveted and my heart was pumping and I felt totally a part of the climbing team - feeling every cold hand grasp and every narrow slip.

The story line is somewhat factual, but not very compelling.  What is most interesting is that these German climbers were climbers first, Germans second, and never Nazis.  Even the pro-Nazi newspaper man is a newspaper man first, and political dunce second.  What the film clearly illustrates is that climbers of this caliber go beyond the term ""fearless"" -- they deliberately face death where life depends on a small ice pick not coming loose on an upper ledge, while the rocks of a 1000 foot cliff give way beneath their boots -- all for the pride of having conquered the North Face of the Eiger.

3819165,5,B001V7P2W2,"The star of this movie is the Eiger Mountain. Yes, the movie is about the first attempted ascent of the Eiger (Ogre in English) and focuses mainly on the two German mountaineers but the mountain is, as I said, truly the star.

The cinematography and the CGI is remarkably beautiful, awe-inspiring, scary and just plain jaw-droppingly unreal. On the DVD extras you get a great look at how the visual effects were done. There's no lengthy boring technical explanation by talking heads. They just show onscreen how layers and backgrounds are painted in as well as snow and wind. It's mindblowing technology and kudos to the visual effects co. Lugungtrug.

The acting also elevates (excuse the pun) what is a basic story--men climb mountain, mountain wins, men lose. The buildup to the climb shows us the lives of the two German mountaineers, Toni Kurz (Benno Furmann) and Andreas Hinterstoisser (Florian Lukas), in their small Bavarian village, Berchtesgarden, that is home to a Nazi mountain brigade (and of course Hitler's summer home) that the two are reluctantly a part of in 1936...until they quit the army and decide to ""attack"" the Eiger.

The other tangent is of newspaper reporters in Berlin who follow the story on the ground and actually on the mountain due to the photographer, Luise (Johanna Wokalek), and her relationship with the climbers as she grew up in the same village. The love story that develops works as Luise transforms herself over the course of the movie from a wide-eyed gopher at the Berlin newspaper offices to a talented photojournalist who sees clearly her future, the future of her nation and that of her mountaineering friends as all intertwined in the politics of the time. Yet the director never lets the politics overwhelm the story.

Back to the filming. In the ""Making Of"" extra you see some of the actual behind-the-scenes footage of what was actually shot on the mountain. These actors and camera crew earned their stripes pulling some of this off.

The ""Making Of"" extra also helps us learn a bit about all these fine German actors including even Luise's boss in the pic and the two actors who play the rival Austrian climbers.

Also, although ""Deleted Scene"" extras on most DVD are usually filler, it is worth watching them on these as they do flesh out some scenes. I guess it was more a time thing but all these scenes do work well.",1313020800,,2374,4.806372549019608

The team breaks down as tragedy after tragedy develops. I kept wondering how the equipment and clothes protected them during those early climbs?

3819176,5,B001V7P2W2,"I am rarely inspired to comment on movies.  This one is simply too good to leave hidden.  On every level this film excels and is memorable.

From the very first frames, the cinematography shows careful framing of every image.  The landscapes are so spectacular that you cannot communicate them in words.  Everything is vast and yet made intimate.  You are really made to feel like you are scaling the mountain.

The film communicates a sense of culture in a very intimate and realistic way.  You feel as if you are a witness to Germany and Austria in 1936.  These are very believable 1936 Germans.  You don't feel you are watching actors.

The tragedy is enormous, but there is also a cautionary tale here about hubris and decision making as well.  It is a tough movie to watch, even for a hardened adult.  I don't recommend this one for young children.

3819180,5,B001V7P2W2,"Since my earliest years, I have been devoted to tales like this. When I was very young, Walt Disney did a two- or three-part story about an ascent of the Matterhorn, which drove me to read my first account of mountain climbing; in later life, I have viewed and read many more such accounts. I am still baffled by the insanity and dedication of the sport of climbing; but even the worst of filmology concerning it grips me. This is in the top echelon of historical - or even fiction - recounting of a deadly, high-skill enterprise.

From the beginning, you are swept up in the story. In 1936, two climbers from Bavaria - Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz - decided to tap into the German fervor to conquer the Eiger, leaving their positions in the Army to attempt glory for the Reich. Actually, if we are to believe the story, they did it for themselves; but the Reich had put a high amount of importance on Germany's successful ascent of the North Face of the Eiger ahead of anybody else. Andi and Toni joined a base camp complete with teams from Austria (not yet incorporated in the circle of the Reich), France and Italy. The ruggedness of the men involved is apparent from the elementary equipment they employ (think canvas tents, simple woolen mittens, and basic, but sturdy, outerwear - nothing like today's high-tech enwrapments), and shows the difficulties in setting up camp and the slyness of heading out in the middle of the night to beat the other teams.

Also involved is a young woman who grew up with both of the Bavarian climbers, and who is now a cub reporter at a paper in Berlin, tapped to cover the story of her two friends' attempt on the mountain by her boss, who accompanies her to the hotel near the base camp on Eiger and who clearly has more personal aspirations where she is concerned. The young woman, Luise, is in love with Toni, and her concern for every aspect of his climb is heartbreakingly detailed, as she worries from the observation deck and with every achieved viewing of their climb. Somewhat knowedgeable about climbing herself, she knows something of what they are going through; you agonize with her every minute she is on film.

I began watching this film very late at night, sleepy; twenty minutes into it, I was wide awake, and the further into the climb I got, the more icy fingers crept down my spine and clutched at my stomach. The beauty of the landscape as seen from the mountain is offset by the unspeakable horror of being trapped on the traverse by avalanches, rockfalls, and howling snowstorms; you watch the movie with the fascination of going by a 14-car pileup on the highway - scared to death of the outcome, but unable to look away. The pathos is added to by the fact that a railway tunnel cuts through the mountain to the summit, with viewing windows cut into the face of Eiger at strategic spots, and at one of these windows, the troubled climbers could be heard and seen but not reached. Constantly juxtaposed is the dichotomy of the climbers on the mountain facing impossible odds and the warmth and civility of the hotel beneath them, with its comfortable clientele, dining in four-star opulence and cosying up to the fireplace.

A movie that must have been technically hugely difficult to film, but done so well, with excellent dialogue and stunning scenery, it comes highly recommended for anyone interested in a real-life thrill ride. Subtitled, but don't let that stop you; this is a footnote of history that will make the commute from work to home seem banal and innocent by comparison.",1296950400,3,3557,4.650238473767885
3819181,5,B001V7P2W2,Two young brave mountain climbers push the envelope to attempt to become the first to scale the north face. One does not have to be a mountain climber to appreciate the importance seemingly small decisions have on the results of our efforts. Be prepared for surprises.

3819182,5,B001V7P2W2,"This movie paints a vivid picture of the experiences of the main characters.  You can step into the shoes of any of them and feel what they felt.  In contrast to modern day mountaineers, these old-school climbers made up for the lack of high-tech equipment with gumption and grit, wills of steel and plain old bravery.  You will admire them for their humanity, whether they succeed or not, or even if they wore Nazi uniform.  Viewers who are non-climbers will have no trouble identifying with the constant and opposing pull between hope and fear that they faced through out their ordeal, when each decisions carries the gravitas of life or death.  Viewers who are climbers will have an additional gut-wrenching understanding of the agony of having to retreat from a first ascent so close to completion.

The visual effect of this movie is also excellent.  With appropriate use of contrasting colors and lighting between the hotel and the wall, the sunny days and the snowstorm, special effects of the blizzard, close up and panorama views of the ascent, it puts you emotionally close to the characters and at the same time, fully aware of the bigger context that they are in.

My only disappointment about this film is the ending.

The fact was relentlessly tragic and more heroic. There was no guardian angel in the form of a woman encouraging Toni Kurz to keep awake during the night, he had to do more difficult operations than merely unravelling the ropes and connecting them, and his last words were not feeble 'Mir ist so kalt...' but 'Ich kann nicht mehr...' which were a heart-rending utterance of a life who had fought to the end and literally exhausted itself.

The German team gets to the mountain by riding their bicycles from Berchtesgaden! What starts out as a peaceful little climb in front of the watchful eyes of journalists and tourists turns into a tragic event that truly touches anyone who is watching this movie. There were times when the slowly moving camera (from a true bird's eye view) showing the dark grey rocks of the Eiger reminded me of the waves of the dark ocean surrounding the sinking Titanic.

As you watch the two climbers battle the brutal conditions you'll be shocked by the primitive equipment they were using in 1936. It's hard to describe just how great and suspensful this movie is--it leaves you speechless at the ending.

I was a climber once, never ever at this level, but I was good enough that I recognized the feeling of when someone was climbing around us that wasn't or shouldn't be where we were.  So somebody who wrote this movie knew something about climbing and captured at least one aspect of climbing very accurately.  At that point in the movie is probably when I lost consciousness of the subtitles and suspended disbelief.
They attempted to capture the attitude of climbers, but that can never be conveyed.  Up is the only way.
I liked the give and take between Toni and Andi, it was kind of the inter conscience of most climbers. In the climbing world though Toni's and Andi's decisions were the right ones.  Glad I never faced them.
I'd just add that even without a knowledge of climbing this is an excellent movie.

It's a pleasure to watch a film that covers all the dramatic bases well. Nordwand starts pleasantly, introducing the characters one by one with subtle details that say volumes but with little effort. We get to know the people, and then the adventure begins. I could really feel for these guys, and for once the love story didn't seem tacked on; it plays out like an integral part of the movie.

In fact, the best performance here might be from Johana Wokalek, excellent as the young photographer---you can believe the love she portrays. But everyone is solid, and my only qualm might be that the last 30 minutes stretch a little too long, with too many tense close-ups etc. Still, the tension is real and I felt like I was there; the music is perfect, the sound of the snow and wind quite visceral, and I felt cold while watching this on a hot Texas night. That's good filmmaking.

It helped a lot that I didn't know the story ahead of time; if you also don't, just watch the film before learning more. I was suitably surprised by what happens and never felt manipulated as in many films of this type. The climbing scenes are magnificent, perhaps the best I've ever seen, and you come away with huge respect for these early climbers and what they did with such basic equipment.

All in all, a gripping adventure recommended to fans of mountains, man vs. nature adventures, and even those who enjoy a low-key love story.

One quibble: I speak German and the subtitles are miles off in many parts, not even beginning to convey the subtlety of what these characters are saying at points.

Finally, a German movie that doesn't delve into the Hollocaust or World War II, although the ubiquitous Nazis make their appearance.  What makes this movie so impressionable is that it is based on real characters, Toni Kurz and Andi Hinterstoisser, who died during the descent, along with two Austrians they competed against to make it to the top. The story takes place 17-21 July 1936.

The first half introduces the viewer to the background.  Both Toni and Andi are with the German Army and not very enthusiastic Nazis.  They climb mountains in their spare time, and both are reluctantly recruited to be the first German team to make it to the top of the Eiger via the North Face.  Toni's old girlfriend Luise from the Berliner Zeitung is sent down to Berchtesgaden to interview the two men, take photographs and later witness the event along with other spectators from a base camp hotel.  Toni encourages his partner Andi to attempt the climb to give Luise some press recognition.  As Luise's boss tells her, ""You will need either a triumphant victory or a tragic end""

Despite the weather turning ominous, the teams take off.  An hour into this suspenseful movie, all hell breaks loose with everything going wrong: rock slides, avalanches, slippage, head and leg injuries, lost gear, and all this while the wind is howling and the men are screaming for the second hour.  The tension never lets up. The viewer wants the men to live, but one by one they perish.
