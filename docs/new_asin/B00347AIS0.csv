4066474,3,B00347AIS0,"The world lost a treasure when Audrey Hepburn died. Fortunately we are lucky to have her spirit and personality available to us on DVD. ""Love Among Thieves"" is a familiar plot and therefore predictable. However, the chemistry between Robert Wagner and Audrey Hepburn makes this made for TV film worth seeing. This film is not her best work but it does give us another opportunity to experience the rare, ethereal quality we associate with Audrey.",1356998400,,446,4.96
4066475,4,B00347AIS0,Haven't been able to watch it yet! It only plays on dvd's not pc's and my dvd player just broke. Always check the to see which device the dvd will be able to play in is my advise.,1349568000,,179,3.736842105263158
4066476,5,B00347AIS0,"This was Audrey Hepburn's last starring role, and one not to be missed if you love her films. I have enjoyed almost every movie Audrey Hepburn made. This one is no exception. It's a fun adventure. Lots of action! As a viewer, I knew from the beginning that we were being led into a twisted plot with lots of switches and surprises, and I loved every minute of it. She is obviously older than we're used to seeing her, but always elegant with a hint of mischief.  This one can be enjoyed by the whole family. I noticed that her favorite designer, Givenchy, designed the evening gowns she wore in the movie. Nice touch!

Audrey Hepburn plays the role of an elegant, wealthy Baroness. Her almost-frail vulnerability is charming.
Robert Wagner is the clumsy, unsophisticated oaf who just happens to appear whenever she needs him---but is he one of the good guys, or one of the bad guys? Is he employed by Interpol? a master thief? a killer? or just a good-natured guy who bumbled into her life? You won't know till the end.  I even loved all of the supporting characters, good and bad. They were all great.

My copy did stop at a certain point and I had to go back to the beginning. I also should have dusted it off before I played it. I pulled it out, cleaned it, and it worked fine after that. The movie was worth the effort.",1332547200,13,1323,4.387755102040816
4066477,4,B00347AIS0,"The fabulous Audrey Hepburn was delightful in this sero-comedic effort. Robert Wagner lends his charm to a picture that might have benefitted from a little more substance but, is witty and fast paced. I loved Audrey from past movies so it was easy to like her in this picture.",1324771200,,276,4.653061224489796
4066478,5,B00347AIS0,"In Hepburn's last major role she doesn't fail in humour, beauty and well brill acting! As soon as Audrey and Robert meet in this drama turned comedy they hit it off straight away, sending viewers into laughs. This film is similar to some other Hepburn films - such as Charade and How To Steal A Million. I highly recommend this. This film - made for TV - is packed full of laughs, tension and whodunnits. Great condition, worth the price.",1277596800,16,438,4.4875
4066479,5,B00347AIS0,"Fast service on a rare Audrey Hepburn film, a comedy with Robert Wagner. Enjoyable !",1274832000,,84,4.666666666666667
4066480,3,B00347AIS0,"Yes, this is not one of Miss Hepburn's best film, however she is still ""THE FAIREST LADY OF ALL"", classy, elegant and a gem.  Like her film with Ben Gazarra ""They All Laughed"", and this flick with Robert Wagner, Audrey did make both films because both her friends Ben & Robert asked her to.",1274227200,2,290,4.37037037037037
4066481,2,B00347AIS0,"This dvd film plays well for about 40 minutes then you have a major cut. You can't just press ffw because it's stuck. You'll have restart the film and when you're almost at the cut you'll have to go ffw four times the speed to get past it and when you rewind be sure not to go too much or you'll get stuck again.
I'm sorry to say I'm not satisfied.",1272672000,,348,3.915492957746479
4066482,2,B00347AIS0,"Probaly Audrey Hepburn's worst ever film; it seems like the only reason she made it is that the co-star was her neighbour when she lived in Switzerland, and she liked his tv series.",1270166400,,181,4.515151515151516
4066483,2,B00347AIS0,ok,1432771200,,2,2.0
4066484,4,B00347AIS0,"Audrey can't be beat, this film shows her in a different light. Not a movie I would normally like or watch but it is entertaining, I guess Ms. Hepburn always has that charm no matter what movie she is in.",1429920000,,204,4.125
4066485,5,B00347AIS0,excellent,1425340800,,9,9.0
4066486,3,B00347AIS0,"While this movie is much like her other caper movies, I was very disappointed to find that she had been typecast much like Meg Ryan has been and therefore not able to much outgrow her past. Had she made the movie when she was in her 20s or even 30s, the script would have been more becoming, perhaps even more interesting. The movie itself is fairly predictable, but not entirely tiresome and dull.",1423612800,,398,4.465753424657534
4066487,4,B00347AIS0,Nice but a little bit overdone...,1420588800,,33,4.666666666666667
4066488,3,B00347AIS0,Had not seen this TV movie with Audrey Hepburn and Robert Wagner. I was preparing a class on Audrey and wanted to check this out. It's pretty weak with a script that leave a lot to be desired. It wants to have the charm and excitement of CHARADE but it is has neither charm nor much in the way of excitement. If you are a Hepburn fan and haven't seen this you may want to take a look. Just don't expect much. The transfer if fine.,1407715200,,430,4.011627906976744
4066489,4,B00347AIS0,"Ms Hepburn is always lovely to watch. The film was fun to watch. She was one of the world's greatest actors and the poster woman representing pure femininity in life and strength of character. I had the honor of being in a Love Among Thieves scene with Ms Hepburn and Robert Wagner filmed on Nob Hill in San Francisco. The editor cut me out of the shot, but I was there and got paid SAG wages for the day. During the set-ups of the shot, a black mercedes pulled up across the street (in front of the Huntington Hotel) a senior citizen got out and crossed the street to the delightful surprise of both Audrey Hepburn and Robert Wagner. Ms Hepburn jumped out of the car in which she was rehearsing, Robert Wagner joined her in greeting Joseph Cotten on the location set-up. Mr. Wagner put his arm around him and assisted Mr. Cotten back to his car. It was a marvelous moment that I had the opportunity to be part of on the set. I shall always be grateful to have been so close to Hollywood's classic actor's.",1396224000,14,1006,4.328042328042328
4066490,4,B00347AIS0,"A nice entertaining movie with this cast.  Something to enjoy the stars after their ""prime time"".  Hepnurn was always a treat to watch.",1380499200,,135,4.826086956521739
4066491,2,B00347AIS0,I am a huge Audrey Hepburn fan but don't recall watching this on TV. Or maybe I blocked the memory out?  She was still beautiful knowing how to age gracefully. However she was  a little too old for this role but what struck most is how bored she looked. There was no spark of enthusiasm in either lead. They looked like they had phoned the performances in.  They probably just jumped at the chance to work together or pay the rent. It's a pity the material they had to work with was so poor and so badly directed. The scenes with the bandits in the cave etc are ridiculous.  Oh well. Still loverly to watch her. I watched Wait Until Dark after it and felt a lot better.,1377388800,,669,4.203125
4066492,1,B00347AIS0,"I'm the ultimate Audrey Hepburn fan, but I really disliked this movie. The plot was ridiculous, the dialogue waaaay to cutesy, and - unlike other reviewers here - I didn't think there was an ounce of chemistry between Hepburn and Wagner.  I can't imagine why either one of them agreed to do this film - perhaps they were bored.  There were two wonderful moments - one at the beginning and one at the end.  In both, Audrey was wearing gorgeous evening gowns designed by Givenchy.  Jaw-dropping beautiful.",1372896000,3,503,4.747126436781609
8388262,4,B00347AIS0,"Not her best, but still enjoyable. Nothing wrong with Audrey and it certainly has some wonderful moments. Probably needed some rewriting and cutting in the production stage, etc to tighten it up a bit.",1522281600,,201,4.9411764705882355
8388263,3,B00347AIS0,Love Audrey Hepburn but was disappointed in this one.  Just did not find it interesting.,1503878400,,88,4.866666666666666
8388264,5,B00347AIS0,"Excellent movie.  Ms Hepburn and Mr Wagner two consummate professionals, Mr Wagner role was a lot of fun to watch.  Recommend",1498521600,,125,4.904761904761905
8388265,5,B00347AIS0,anything with Audrey Hepburn in or written about is definitely something I will always purchase.......,1458518400,,102,5.866666666666666
8388266,5,B00347AIS0,Thanks.,1457913600,,7,7.0
8388267,3,B00347AIS0,"This seems to have been made for TV, as there are lots of fade outs, probably for commercials.  The plot is predictable and Wagner is his usual, TV persona, as portrayed on ""To Catch a Thief"".  Hepburn seems fragile and out of her element, as if she did this for the money.  The dresses were not her usual Givenchy and one red one, she never should have worn as it made her look extremely flat-chested.  I wondered what the wardrobe department was thinking to do this to a fashion icon?  I remember that she was ill with cancer at the end of her life and she looks as if she is wasting away in that dress.  They should have covered her up instead of exposing so much flesh.  There is nothing remarkable about this film, which seems to be more of an episode of someone's TV show than a feature film.  It's ok, but not special; the plot is thin and the dialogue second-rate.  This is not ""Charade"" or ""How To Steal a Million"", and I kinda wish I hadn't seen Audrey like this.  I prefer to remember her as she was before she became ill.",1457395200,2,1033,4.224489795918367

8388269,5,B00347AIS0,Awesome movie for an 80s made for TV flick. Really loved seeing Audrey in her last leading role still beautiful and charming.  She and Robert Wagner were great together.,1448064000,,169,4.827586206896552

8388271,3,B00347AIS0,"A ""B"" movie at best.....good story but not nearly enough of Audrey Hepburn in it.  Only a few close up views of her.  Any stand in could have done this movie instead of her ....and be passed off as Audrey.  Disappointing to me.  Thank you.",1433116800,,239,4.2444444444444445
