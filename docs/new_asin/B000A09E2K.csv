8070885,1,B000A09E2K,I love Errol Flynn movies but this movie with his son is really bad. He's not much of an actor and the whole thing is pretty corny!,1456272000,,131,3.888888888888889
8070886,4,B000A09E2K,"This 1962 pirate thriller features Sean Flynn, son of the legendary Errol Flynn, as a young and handsome Englishman at sea, who is taken captive by pirates and becomes one, more or less in self defense, just like his father in the movie.  The original movie features some glorious cinemascope scenery in the Caribbean.  There are a couple of decent fight scenes, including one inside a tavern, a pretty young lady to be saved, and a thrilling ending in which the young Captain Blood and his crew take on a corrupt governor and a hurricane to save his mother.  The movie recreates the charming pirate haven of Port Royal in Jamaica, and the scenes at sea are exciting.  The movie is entirely derivative  of the original starring Errol Flynn, but it is good fun, and worth watching if you happen to run across a copy.",1401753600,4,815,4.593103448275862
