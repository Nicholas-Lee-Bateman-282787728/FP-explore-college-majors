4582138,5,B0056031NW,My husband and I look forward to relaxing on Sunday evening with an episode of Inspector Lewis.  We both enjoy British mysteries and these never fail to entertain.  Inspector Lewis and his associate Hathaway are fascinating characters and when you add an intriguing and complex murder to solve the plots are taken to the next level.  There are lots of characters and many twists that keep one thinking to the end.  Highly recommend for British mystery fans.,1331510400,6,457,4.896103896103896
4582139,5,B0056031NW,i love british series and when my sister told me about this series i knew that i had to purchase this item because i had to have it as a part of my collection!,1329955200,,159,3.7058823529411766
4582140,5,B0056031NW,"This product contains seasons 1 thru 4.  Since we intend to purchase each new season as it becomes available, we hope they keep the packaging consistent as it is very well done.  Many of the episodes have a reference to an earlier Morse episode, sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle.  The writers have done a great job of maintaining the flavor of the earlier Morse series, while developing the new character, played by Laurence Fox, who is, in effect, a young Morse in the bud.  We will cherish viewing this series again and again in the future.",1328313600,10,545,4.705263157894737
4582141,5,B0056031NW,"Wife & I love the Inspector Lewis series.  We like having the full-length, (almost) unexpurgated version.  Good writing, convoluted plots, lots of dead bodies, and Lewis is paired with a Cambridge man.  So you can actually learn a little something from watching. Not too overly histrionic, just occasionally. Has a lot of unusual British words and phrases.  Laurence Fox is a pleasure to watch, a man of both words and action.  That's enough for now. (DVD cost was low, fast shipment, good quality.)",1325980800,89,499,4.963855421686747
4582142,5,B0056031NW,I really love the Lewis series......far better than Morse!  Excellent set and full length episodes. Would enjoy seeing more of Lewis and Hathaway. Will keep my eyes peeled in case they do more!,1325894400,4,193,4.848484848484849
4582143,5,B0056031NW,"Well, if I'm within reasonable accuracy, in jolly green England there is a 5th series of 4 more films on dvd but so far, that is, of this moment as I give my keyboard a needed torture on 19 Dec. 2011, this 5th dvd is only available in region 2 and not in Yankee America.

In addition, there is a blu-ray series 4 here in America.

BTW, I have series 1, 2, 3 and the complete Morse so I can say I love these movies.  Can't beat'em, ranked at the top with only a few others.",1324252800,12,472,3.8958333333333335
4582144,5,B0056031NW,"The superb acting and character development of Kevin Whately as Detective Inspector Robert Lewis, and Laurence Fox as his partner, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, are a treat. Laurence Fox as Hathaway is a great surprise, playing a wryly humorous ex-seminarian with issues of his own. Kevin Whately as Lewis is perfect as a widowed survivor, in search of the perpetrator of the hit-and-run that left him bereft. Clare Holman as Dr. Laura Hobson adds another rich dimension to the narratives, as does Rebecca Front as the formidable ""Mum,"" Chief Superintendent Innocent. The wonderful Dr. Hobson first arrived in the previous series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Morse-Set-Ten/dp/B0044PGU24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Morse, Set Ten</a>, Disk 2, ""The Way Through the Woods.""

One can't always be a Badger of Badger's Drift, hoping for help from the wry team of Barnaby and Jones. Although Lewis and Hathaway are another duo altogether, and this series lacks the tongue-in-cheek self mocking of Midsomer, ""Lewis"" is well worth exploring. Of course, it's a treat to meander through Oxford's beautifully filmed spires, cobbled streets, and nearby countryside. The tensions between upper-class academics and regular citizens of Oxfordshire are explored. Lewis may start me on a long-term sandwich and ale streak, as the sustenance looks delicious and some viewers are highly suggestible in terms of gluttony, if not violence. I prefer food. Just wish Lewis could have kept the cat who devours fish & chips. The last excellent mystery, ""The Gift of Promise,"" features the deadpan, super-smart Hathaway advising a gifted child that growing up angry makes finding one's place in the world much more difficult. The whole series balances the relationship between Lewis and Hathaway marvelously, each with his own strengths, no egos running amuck. Enjoy!

PS: After finishing this wonderful collection, there's a new prequel to Inspector Morse:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Endeavour/dp/B007T40GRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Endeavour</a>.

4582146,5,B0056031NW,"I wrote to PBS. The episodes in this box set will be the full length shows as aired in the UK, not the shorter edited-for-Masterpiece versions. We still might have to deal with annoying Alan; didn't ask about that.

Lewis, Hathaway and Laura, any episode, anytime, what could be better?

All, saw the comments of early purchasers. I am sorry if my 9/6/11 post misled you. The only info I had was what shoppbs (dot) org told me,

It doesn't compare favorably to Foyle's War, the very best British mystery series that I've seen.  I've watched Foyle's War (the set from 1-7) four times.  I don't expect to watch the Inspector Lewis series more than one time.  While the acting is good, and the comradery between the 3 main characters is fun to watch, the story line is redundant and predictable.  Each segment requires 3 people to be killed before the first murder is solved.  This series would be good, possibly with a better writer.",1405382400,,636,4.779816513761468

I got these (pilot thru series 4)  quite some time ago and have been waiting for a weekend when I knew I was not going anywhere at all.

Watched them all this w/e, some I like more than others, but like all of them

4 main characters of the series, work really well together, sometimes actors click great and other times not - this is a series where the main characters click Great !

 -  Kevin Whately (Insp Lewis)  Laurence Fox (Sgt Hathaway), Clare Holman (Dr. Laura Hobson) and Rebecca Front (Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent) - all great actors

4582193,5,B0056031NW,"I realize it's 2 years after I bought this product, but I realized in reviewing my past purchases today that I never did a review of this. Let me start off by saying it's an incredibly good series, great acting, writing, atmosphere, & chemistry between the players. This set contains episodes 1-20(different series numbering between the US & the UK). It's on an absolute par with the original Morse series(the present prequel Morse series ""Endeavour"" is also terrific). To finally set straight the questions regarding what are the full episodes vs. the cut(by 10+ minutes) on Masterpiece Mystery on PBS: I checked the length on every episode in this box, & episodes 9-20 & episode 1(pilot) were the full length UK edition. Episodes 2-8 were the shorter version. I bought a region-free DVD player(actually cheaper than what you would think) & bought from Amazon UK these ITV episodes in England so I could see the complete episodes, another 10-12 minutes for each one. I feel this was important, because every single minute of these episodes are so absorbing & important. Also, episodes 21-27 bought in the US are also complete, it says ""original UK edition"" on the DVD cover. I don't know if the latest box set(pilot & series 1-6) has rectified episodes 2-8. Looking forward to the return of Lewis in October!!!",1404432000,3,1311,4.883408071748879

4582195,4,B0056031NW,"Detectives and mystery go together. The stories are good but sometimes hard to keep all the names of those involved separated. Also the humor is good but the thick English and with speech suddenly dropping to a pianissimo is a bit frustrating.

They encouraged me to feel like they were real people in real situations. This is probably the only way I will see Oxford in my lifetime.

Shame on me for not researching further on my own. The first 2 discs have subtitles. The rest of them have a notation in the menu stating you can get CC from your own TV. I have two TV's and neither one of them was able to show these supposed available subtitles. I am hearing impaired and I do not purchase any DVD's anymore that are not close captioned. I am sorely disappointed with this particularly since I had to wait a while before I could afford to purchase it. I wish Amazon would define whether a DVD has subtitles or not in the specs.

4582258,3,B0056031NW,"Lewis started out as a Sergeant under inspector Morse 20 years earlier. In those days he was a contented, easy going young guy with a happy home life. He was a good contrast to Morse, who was smarter but grouchy and snooty. Now in this series, Lewis is the inspector, but he is bitter over his wife's death and always pi--ed off and angry. His demeanor is unpleasant all thru the series. And his assistant Sergeant Hathaway is kind of bland, so no great chemistry between them like there was between Lewis and Morse. Other than that, the scenery is the same Oxford town and the stories have similar pace and style as in Inspector Morse series. If I didn't watch Ins. Morse series and compared the two, I may have liked this one better, but it's impossible not to compare them.",1384732800,,776,4.471830985915493

I enjoy this series for it is filled with more than one situation going one.  Sub plots and variety, plus stability.  I like these actually better than Morse.  Perhaps because they are a little more modern.  There was one story however that we could well do without.  It dealt with human depravity that was so offensive as to make me turn it off.

Several times the oral part of the show did not match the visual part of the show as to speaking.

When we learned that the episodes had been edited to fit the one hour format for PBS we decided to order the first four season set because the episodes were not edited. What a difference it makes to have the entire unedited episodes. The stories are much easier to follow and we enjoy them much more than the PBS versions.

4582389,5,B0056031NW,"Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on Inspector Morse - Complete Collection stars as Detective Inspector Lewis in ""Inspector Lewis"", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.

Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).

This boxed set contains the following episodes:
Pilot Episode

Whom the Gods Would Destroy - When an Oxford don's former classmate is found murdered, he comes under suspicion, but Lewis and Hathaway need to tread with care given the sensitive nature of the case.

Old School Ties - Lewis is not happy when he is assigned ""babysitting"" duties with Hathaway. The celebrity in need of protecting is a reformed criminal turned celebrity author. When an attractive young student turns up dead, there are many suspects to choose from - her circle of college mates who all seem to be rather ambivalent in their feelings toward the girl, and also the celebrity himself. When the celebrity himself ends up murdered, Lewis' past comes back in the attractive form of his ex-schoolmate and ex-girlfriend, who turns out to be the widower/ agent of the dead man.

Expiation - An apparent suicide of a North Oxford housewife perplexes Lewis. There was no suicide note, and the dead woman's life seemed too perfect to be true. Lewis and Hathaway dig deeper to get at the truth.
And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.

Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?

Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.

The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garroted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?
Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.

The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.

The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.
Counter Culture Blues - rock star Esme Ford returns to Oxford after thirty-five years to re-establish her band Midnight Addiction, though she was thought to have drowned decades earlier. Everything is veiled in secrecy, but not for long, as bodies begin to pile up.

The Dead of Winter - DS Hathaway finds the past coming back to haunt him when he is assigned to work on a homicide linked to the Crevecouer Estate, where Hathaway's dad once worked as an estate manager. As he finds himself attracted to an old childhood acquaintance, he finds the family may be harboring some very dark secrets, enough to warrant murder.

Dark Matter - A professor of astronomer is found dead in the university observatory soon after confession in church. His widow believes he was having an affair. When another victim is found, Lewis and Hathaway discover that someone has knowledge of the connections between the victims and what motivated the killings. Trouble is, the person who can help is a retired porter who is living in a home and senile.

Your Sudden Death Question - It is a Bank Holiday weekend, and Lewis is making plans for a night at the opera with the coroner, Laura (Hathaway is off at a world music festival), but their plans are ruined by a murder at Oxford during a quiz weekend. One of the participants, Ethan Croft, a brilliant ex-student who left Oxford over sexual harassment allegations, is found murdered. Soon after, another participant, Eve, who had been seen with Croft earlier is also found dead. Lewis and Hathaway have to work out if this is merely a crime of passion or something more.

Falling Darkness - One of my favorite episodes. Dr. Laura Hobson is planning a Halloween get-together with her two ex-college roommates, when one of them, Ligeia, is found murdered. Then, Ellen Jacoby, Laura's other friend, is attacked but survives. What is the killer's motivations and is Laura revealing all that she knows? This episode sees DI Lewis placed in a difficult position as he has to determine if Laura, whom he is extremely fond of, is actually being honest with him, and this places strain on the burgeoning relationship between the two.

This boxed set also contains cast interviews and extras.

I have become a fan of Inspector Lewis and his devoted sergeant Hathaway. Lewis may not be Morse, but this series is charming in its own right - there's a high sense of atmosphere, and the scenic Oxford setting makes it a series of high aesthetic value. The cinematography and score are beautifully done. The plots are not as intricate as those in the Morse series, but I love the wonderful chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway, not to mention the lovely pathologist Hobson.",1367539200,4,6382,4.835930339138405
4582390,5,B0056031NW,"I had never seen either Inspector Morse or Lewis until I watched Inspector Lewis on Amazon Prime Video. I was hooked. Then a friend lent me his Inspector Morse DVD's imported from England along with a Region 2 player for them. Morse series was 33 episodes of the best character driven mystery I have ever seen. Morse (Robert Thaw) is so good and Lewis (Kevin Whately) his ""common man"" assistant in the most well written series I have ever seen. I love the Oxford setting, focus on characters instead of gore and violence and watching the development of the two leads. So I decided that I must have both sets in my collection,because these will be viewed more than once. The Lewis series is almost up to the Morse level, and the Hathaway character is almost as interesting as Morse. So much fluff and spectacle that passes for entertainment, but these series are truly worth buying.

Despite the fact that I am a fan , I think that I can say without prejudice that these are some of the best written mysteries on television. This is no simple whodoneit, but has complex plots and motives and you will find yourself switching from suspect to suspect until the very end which will often leave you saying ""I didn't see that coming"". I discovered these on PBS during series 3 so it was nice to go back to the begining and see the evolution of charecters and relationships.

However, out of the 10 disc set - only the first two discs have such subtitles.  The remainder of the DVDs state you must set the menu on your TV and/or player to subtitles to access these.  However, after trying this on both an older and a new DVD player and two different TVs, these subtitles were not accessible.  All other discs I have which indicate subtitles do show these.
I did contact PBS to alert them to the issue.  The response was basically that the other discs were ""close captioned"" and it must be my problem.  One comment was that since one player was a new Blu-Ray, these discs would not show subtitles on these new players.  It's incredible to me that you state you have subtitles knowing these would not work on at least some players.
As stated before, the series is wonderful.  But PBS should be ashamed of this tactic.  Advertising SDH subtitles and then providing them on only the first 2 of 10 discs smacks of bait and switch.

If you like Midsomer Murders, you will love this, and no: stupid antics from the sidekick, no repeat wife and daughter having their own scenes and dragging down the plot, and no idiotic ME.

credits has not been cut. In other words,each episode starts immediately
upon selecting it.
The cost including shipping ran to $50. Cdn.(about the same in Us dollars)

For example, in the series pilot, When Inspector Lewis and Detective Sergeant Hathaway are walking along a gravel pathway, the crunching of the gravel under their feet makes it very difficult to hear their conversation. There are other instances (too many) where the sound mixing could be better. Background sounds and music intrudes too much. It's a shame, because, as I have already commented, I like the plots a lot.
I have watched these on both TV, through a DVD player, and on the computer. Same result.

4582534,5,B0056031NW,"I'm Sherlocked & Cumberbatched so Lewis and Hathaway have to take second place.

Just call it old school policing - the delightful Inspector Lewis may feel like an odd man out. But that's a good thing indeed.

The show, based on characters created by Colin Dexter, is now itself a long-running spinoff of the longer-running mystery drama Inspector Morse, which featured John Thaw as the titular detective--wary of authority and enamored of opera, real English beer, and his Jaguar--who was ceremoniously killed off in 2000.

Like its predecessor, Lewis revolves around police investigators attempting to solve murders in Oxford, where town and gown sit uncomfortably side by side. In Lewis, the gruff Robbie Lewis--widowed after a hit-and-run driver killed his wife--is joined by the reserved, erudite Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, a Cambridge-educated copper who dropped out of the seminary to pursue police work.

Rather than follow the conventions of the run-off-the-mill pair of cops, Lewis and Hathaway have settled into a comfortable amiability. Lewis's existence--microwaved dinners eaten standing up, an ongoing simmering flirtation with forensic pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson-underscores a haunting loneliness, an unwilling return to bachelorhood in the face of loss.

In many respects, Hathaway is like Morse: he's knowledgable about the finer things in life--poetry, philosophy, mythology--and the mysteries of religion. In Oxford, where the suspects are often university students or dons, it pays to have a partner who knows a thing or two about Nietzsche or Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark.

Television needs more subtle and engaging shows like this one, which blends together intoxicating mysteries with a deep and abiding appreciation for literature, music, and art. In the end, Lewis, it seems, is just as unique as Carroll.",1349740800,6,1853,5.507042253521127

PBS unabashedly cut down the UK versions of many episodes and that's a shame, if not a crime. These episodes are 2 hours long and they've been abridged to approximately 85 minutes.

Whom the Gods Would Destroy - 120 minutes - series 1
And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - 120 minutes - series 2
The Great and the Good - 120 minutes - series 2
The Dead of Winter - 120 minutes - series 4
Wild Justice - 120 minutes - series 5
The Mind has Mountains - 120 minutes - series 5
The Gift of Promise - 120 minutes - series 5
The Soul of Genius - 120 minutes - series 6
Generation of Vipers - 120 minutes - series 6
Fearful Symmetry - 120 minutes - series 6
Indelible Stain - 120 minutes - series 6

I'm including season 5(USA)/[series 6 UK] in this review because I think people should know that PBS has cut out 5 1/2 hours of this show from their DVD's. For this particular boxed set the abridged episodes end at, ""The Gift of Promise"" with a total of 3 1/2 hours edited out. Every episode of season 5(USA) is missing 30 minutes of content. There is so much in the 30 minutes of content that's needed to clarify the story-lines. The episodes now look choppy to me. Why do some characters have relationships and how does each individual relate to the others? I still love Lewis but I'd love to see the full length versions, if only to understand the story the way the writers intended them to be.

To cut out 30 minutes from each episode, I think someone had to do some injudicious editing. Shame on PBS for deceiving the public, again. They should have the decency to sell the full version of the show on DVD. The price they're asking for on their website is $99.99. I don't think it's worth full price.

A few of the disc's are CC'd and the rest are subtitled. It's inconsistent and poor quality of content. The show itself is very good.",1346371200,88,2093,4.2094763092269325
4582543,5,B0056031NW,"I have watched every Inspector Lewis episode several times over, and still enjoy them. The episode where he discovers (through Hathaway's sleuthing) the man who killed his wife (The Quality of Mercy) is absolutely brilliant. I have seen all the Morse shows, too, but enjoy Lewis more -- he's a more attractive and accessible character, and Hathaway is a great sidekick. The doctor and the chief of detectives are also being developed as excellent characters. If you're a fan of excellent acting, well-plotted stories, and a beautiful environment surrounding them, this is the series for you. The series is getting better as it goes along, too, which is exciting to watch.",1346371200,2,671,5.054054054054054
4582544,5,B0056031NW,"If you enjoy mystery you will enjoy Inspector Lewis. It sucks the viewer in, wanting more and more stories. Inspector Lewis and Sergent Hathaway are an amazing team with human errors and canny ability to solve mystery murder cases. Cant wait for Inspector Hathaway series. This could go on forever and would still watch every episode. I highly recommend an episode in the third series episode one- (spoiler it is about former rock band- watched it once and could not stop from watching complete series)",1345766400,,502,4.91764705882353
4582545,5,B0056031NW,"The Inspector Lewis Masterpiece series is absolutely terrific!  The acting and writing is great.  Always a bunch of ""red herrings"" before you find out ""who done it.""",1345680000,,165,5.074074074074074
4582546,5,B0056031NW,"'Lewis' continues where 'Inspector Morse' left off. Morse's former sergeant, the eponymous Lewis, is now promoted to inspector. Whereas before Lewis was the down-to-earth, sensible, working class figure balancing the sensitive, aesthetic, lonely, somewhat tortured Morse, he is now the down-to-earth, sensible, working-class figure balancing the sensitive, aesthetic, lonely, somewhat tortured Hathaway. The difference is that Lewis has become the boss and he must take responsibility for using Hathaway's talents effectively and for solving the crimes.

At first, you may find (if you had previously watched 'Morse') it's a little difficult to think of Lewis as the man in charge, so completely was he the subordinate in his previous role. However, stick with it; soon you will find that your mind re-orients itself and accepts the notion that Lewis, obviously Hathaway's intellectual inferior, nevertheless brings sturdy common sense and reliability to the senior position and uses Hathaway's complementary qualities just as Morse used to use his. This requires considerable skill from the actors involved and Kevin Whately as Lewis and Laurence Fox as Hathaway play their parts very convincingly.

Laura Hobson the pathologist (played by Clare Holman) first appeared in the later part of the 'Morse' series and here she has an expanded role. Lewis's wife has been killed (not a spoiler, it doesn't happen in the show) and Laura is a friend who just might become more than that. The writers cleverly allow the possibility to remain in the background while the mysteries play out, and the added depth the relationship brings to the characters adds to the empathy which we feel for them. The other principal supporting character is Lewis's boss, Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent (Rebecca Front), whose name belies her sharp and shrewd personality. There is, as usual in British mysteries, a splendid list of guest stars as murderers, victims and suspects.

A very fine series and a worthy successor to Morse. The only slight quibble I have is that it's very difficult to work out which series is which, as for TV purposes they were divided differently in the US from the original UK order. This box set goes some way towards rectifying that, but you should note that this is NOT the complete Lewis collection. There is another series, series 5 in the UK, 6 in the US, which has just been released. The DVD releases are in the UK numbering system, so if you have this set plus the newly released season 5, you have all the 6 seasons released in the US. I hope that's clear, though frankly I doubt it. Let's hope this set will become even more incomplete in due course!",1345420800,5,2669,5.0613636363636365
4582547,1,B0056031NW,A real shame it does not include cc. Its absence prevented me to buy it. Cc should nowadays be considered a regular feature,1344470400,25,123,4.391304347826087
4582548,5,B0056031NW,"As fans of Inspector Morse, we enjoy the ""spinoff"" series featuring Robbie Lewis, Morse's sergeant, who became Detective Inspector and leads the partnership in Oxford, England with the cerebral Hathaway.  The stories are well-written, the setting of Oxford is lovely, and the professional relationship between the two men is fascinating to watch evolve as they work together to solve murder cases.  This is the best of the mystery series on Masterpiece, which already sets a high bar.",1341446400,8,484,5.2727272727272725
4582549,4,B0056031NW,"As a long-time fan of Inspector Morse, I was pleased to see the Inspector Lewis series produced with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse, not to mention some of the same actors returning in different roles.  Perhaps you will find yourself doing what I do when I watch a Lewis episode and see a familiar face--try to remember what role that same actor played previously in one or another of the Morse episodes.

While I've been glad to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis, it's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me the most of their predecessor, the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse. With his background as a former theology student at Cambridge, it's Hathaway who is most likely to recall some obscure detail, of interest only to scholars, to help solve a case he and Lewis are investigating.

If you enjoy Morse, Lewis, and Hathaway as I do, you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius, available at Amazon. It's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the responses contemporary people have to a religious controversy dating back to the Nicene Council.",1338595200,5,1193,4.8669950738916254
4582550,5,B0056031NW,"If you're at all into British TV and/or British murder mysteries, you will want to add Inspector Lewis to ""all the usual suspects"". This is a great series, set in Oxford, England, so it's a bit different from the slightly 'rougher' districts Policed by Jack Frost in Denton. The scenery is captivating, so you have to remember not to get too involved in sightseeing. That's what the 2nd and 3rd viewings are for. I'm savouring each moment of each and every disk. Masterpiece Mystery strikes again, with yet another HIT.",1338336000,4,519,4.777777777777778

Unlike the usual U.S. police dramas, Lewis has very little on-screen violence, the interactions between Lewis and Sgt. Hathaway are interesting and fun to see and the procedural aspects of the police work are quite different from those of U.S. shows.

8458987,5,B0056031NW,"A practically perfect set of mysteries that doesn't suffer from over familiarity with the back stories of the officers involved.  Very little is known about the four main characters.  We never see DI Lewis's rarely mentioned children, his slow moving non-romance with Dr. Hobson never gets beyond a look or two, his dour faced detective sergeant Hathaway is an enigma, and their boss Chief Superintendent Innocent is present only to scold or reprimand.  Being familiar with Inspector Morse is not a requirement (I never saw the previous series).  Supposedly, this series is still continuing even though the character Lewis retired.  The UK is currently filming the 9th series (series 8 for the US release).  I await its release here with great anticipation.",1441065600,,757,5.163934426229508
