8521893,5,B007TXNZJO,"I found this DVD very helpful.  It took you through the steps needed to make three of her doll patterns.  The steps were very clear and I liked how she had close-ups of her hands so you could see exactly what she was doing.  The patterns for these dolls are purchased separately, however you can use the techniques you learn for any Waldorf doll pattern.",1372032000,2,354,4.415384615384616
