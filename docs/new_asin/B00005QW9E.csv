7950978,5,B00005QW9E,"I love this updated addition to the *Families of the World* video series. Like the other films from *FOTW,* it profiles two children---one boy, one girl, one who lives in a city, and the other who lives in the countryside. And like the others, *Families of China* encourages viewers to compare and contrast their own way of life with that of these kids and their families.

The two kids profiled here are Qinbo and Kun. Kun is 9 and lives with his family in a gorgeous mountain village near Xiku, outside Ningbo. They grow bonsai for a living, and his father's efforts in training trees with wire to grow this way are highlighted. The bamboo forest where the bonsai trees grow was something to see! To get ready to start the day, Kun washes up in the kitchen sink, which might be the only one his family's two-room house has. Kun walks a half-hour to school (the subject of much discussion in our family, too, because he sees people washing clothes in streams along the way, and others picking tea leaves). The lunches Kun and his classmates bring from home are steamed for him by a school lunchroom cook. But Kun himself knows how to wash the rice he's going to eat for lunch, and he and his classmates do this together routinely. Every day they eat lunch in their classroom, not in a cafeteria.

Kun's narration (in a boy's voice, in English) includes some background about tea and about the many languages (56!) spoken in China today. The resulting importance of Chinese kids learning one written language made a big impression on the folks we watched this video with.

Qinbo's life in the port city of Ningbo is quite different. She has her own room in their apartment, and the family cooks and eats in a modern (though small) kitchen. (For each kid's video profile, the food shopping, cooking, and communal cooking and eating were much commented on by our family.) Qinbo raises silkworms and talks about this traditional pasttime, which our folks thought was fascinating. Qinbo's mother is a educator in the public schools, and her father helps train port inspectors for the Ningbo shipping authority.

Qinbo's school day was something we talked about quite a bit after watching this video. She wears a uniform, studies in a classroom with almost 60 other kids, and is routinely taught some ideas that were thought provoking to our viewers. These include the one-child rule (mentioned only in passing) and each child's role as part of the greater society. This training is perhaps not so different in theory from the way children are taught about their countries around the world. But as an American watching this video, I thought it was both interesting and sobering to see how a modern non-democratic society (can China still be called communist?) teaches its children about their role in a huge, ethnically diverse country with more than 1 billion people and few of the noneconomic freedoms we take for granted.

But some things remain universal in this video: Family life has a daily routine, a rhythm that each family finds suits its own. Our kids loved this video and have watched it several times, and we've lent it out to others (some of whom would be traveling to China for pleasure or business).

The Teacher's Guide that is included has a complete transcript of the video and various actities, background materials, a map, a glossary, and other supplements that will help kids and adults learn more about Chinese life. For trailers from this video, go to YouTube and look for ""Families of China (Families of the World"" and then ""Rural Trailer"" or ""Urban Trailer."" I'd recommend this video to librarians and to elementary, middle-school, ESL, social studies, and geography teachers as well as to families. This is a great addition to this terrific video series.",1290816000,3,3776,4.8015384615384615

7950980,4,B00005QW9E,"This movie is touching in the very ordinariness of its details:  the children featured wake up, get dressed, play with friends, go to school, eat meals at school and home, wash their feet very carefully before bed, and are cherished by their parents -- just the way that children here are.
I did find myself questioning a few odd details in this film:  the ""country"" child clearly comes from a wealthier family than most in his village (his family seem to be the only ones with a washing machine)... and the fact that, despite the village's poverty, all the children in the school have shiny new uniform track suits.  And then there's the city child, who sounds almost robotic in her defense of China's wonderful socialist government where everybody co-operates towards the country's wellbeing.
These details aside, though, this video is a cute way to introduce kids ages 5-10 to the big wide world outside their own experience -- and to drive home the lesson that other cultures aren't so different from our own.
We will definitely be seeking out the other videos in this series -- Families of Japan, Israel, Ghana, etc... and we're all looking forward immensely to the journey!!!",1029024000,6,1181,4.836633663366337
