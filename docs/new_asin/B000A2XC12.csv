2353893,5,B000A2XC12,This is going to be a Christmas favorite for years to come. I would say that it will become a Christmas classic. Everything about the movie was great. The animation was some of the best I've seen. Having the voice and music of Harry Connick Jr makes it even better.,1133913600,3,265,4.32
2353894,3,B000A2XC12,"Last year, the best Christmas movie was 'The Polar Express' with one actor doing the major roles, from young to old.  It is destined to become a classic.  As much as I have enjoyed Harry Connick's Christmas CD, especially the ""It Must Have Been Old Santa Claus"" track, I kept waiting to hear the music.  I like his music anyway and, since he is from New Orleans, I feel that this animated feature is based in New Orleans, only it is called 'Bluesville,' full of unhappy people.  The mayor is a hardened Scrooge, and all the children know is hardship and how to get into trouble.

That is, until a compassionate misfit at Santa's workshop intervenes on behalf of turning the Christmas season around for these unfortunate children who have never know the magic and fun of Christmas.  He is just too happy for the other elves to befriend, and he takes on this mission to change things in Bluesville.  Santa gives him the opportunity to make the impossible possible.  With the help of the girl delinquent with a heart, who appeals to the robust Mayor to let them have a Christmas tree.  Miracle of miracles, he agrees and magically it appeared all decorated with the star shining on top.

New Orleans comes alive again.  This is Connick's message to America, ""give us a chance to revive into a thriving center"" and thus, it becomes 'Joyville,' a place where everyone can be happy again.  I don't think it will be a classic, like 'Frosty the Snowman' but, like Rudolph, the Elf (don't confuse this with Will Ferrell's silly movie 'Elf') is chosen to accompany Santa on his rounds on Christmas Eve.  This is the one we needed this year to get through the Katrina disaster.  I wish he had incorporated some of his music into the parable like the narrator of 'Frosty' and 'Rudolph.'  That would have made a vast difference for the future showings, but it is pretty great as is.",1133568000,2,1869,4.587349397590361

2354014,5,B000A2XC12,"The Happy Elf (instant video)

Purchased the instant video version of this movie for my Autistic son, who insists on watching this movie at least once per day, as we've already worn out three DVD's since it's release in 2005!

As a huge fan of Harry Connick, Jr. myself, I knew I'd be buying the movie no matter if my kids liked it or not, as I collect all of his music and DVD's; but at the time of the movie's release, my son (now 9) was not yet 2, and was not talking yet (as I said, he's Autistic) -- but the movie captivated him, and he was singing along with the main song (""The Happy Elf"") after hearing it just a couple of times!

The animation is great; the story line is creative, and the music is bouncy and fun. I would highly recommend this purchase to anyone of any age. It's great holiday fun (or, in the case of my child, year-round fun!)",1369267200,3,854,4.132530120481928

2354016,1,B000A2XC12,"I can't remember the last time we watched an animated movie that was this bad. Terrible animation, annoying characters, cringeworthy voices and the plot was just dreadful.

Instead, for a really well made, great fun Christmas movie we recommend Arthur Christmas which is just Fantastic!!",1362441600,4,287,5.377777777777778
2354017,3,B000A2XC12,"Another Christmas movie had made a cute reference to this movie, so I decided to get it for my daughter. It really wasn't a good movie and my daughter only half enjoyed it. The product arrived on time and in great condition, so no slight on the provider. It's just not worth the time to watch it!",1359331200,3,296,4.2105263157894735
2354018,5,B000A2XC12,I enjoyed this so much when I rented it that I watched it twice. Next year I plan to buy it and to make watching it a tradition!,1359244800,,128,3.607142857142857
2354019,5,B000A2XC12,"My son LOVES this video!  He watches it all year round.  It's cute the first 5 times I saw it, but the Elf is so happy that I want to chew glass everytime I see him now.  Still  it is a kid pleaser.",1358899200,,198,3.5348837209302326

2354033,5,B000A2XC12,"Really enjoyed this movie. I love Harry Connick Jr., and I like the jazz/blues genre, so the music was very cool, too. It's also nice to see these 3D specials produced for TV, with much lower budgets so we don't always have to go to the theater to see them. Highly recommend this cute little movie to anyone looking for Holiday Cheer.",1356220800,,334,4.403225806451613

I guess I didn't look closely enough at the description because this dvd arrived from Italy and was in Italian.  I can't play it on our dvd player so it's a waste for us.  I love the movie and was ordering it for my sister-in-law because she love Harry Connick Jr.  I had to reorder the dvd for her.

2354062,5,B000A2XC12,We love Christmas movies and have a fabulous selection from over the years. And The Happy Elf is one of the most enjoyable. Highly recommended for all ages and NO the Taser scene is not scary. It is a non event. No child would be disturb by it. So treat yourself and your family to this movie.,1332028800,,293,4.157894736842105
2354063,1,B000A2XC12,"We really wanted to like this - big fans of Christmas movies, animation, good music - thought this movie might be decent.  Boy, were we wrong.  The ONLY good thing about this film was some of the music, the rest of the film was just... yuck. :(

First, the Animation:  CREEPY!  If you don't know what the ""uncanny valley"" is, look it up.  (Quick explanation: animation or robotics that creep people out.)  The elf's eye's GLOWED blue, like marbles with LEDs in them.  The teeth in characters' mouths were bright white and you could see ALL of them - even the ones far back in the mouth were not shadowed.  So, yes, the characters were very creepy.  The backgrounds were often poorly rendered, with elements like an arched window frame being more octagonal than curved.  Movement and overall color were decent, but shadows were poorly rendered and it was clearly a low budget job (compared to Pixar, Dreamworks, etc.)

Second, the Story:  GRIM and CONFUSING.  The plot line sounds nice, a happy elf going to cheer up a gloomy town (sort of like Rankin-Bass' Santa Claus is coming to town, but nowhere near that sweet or charming) but the actual story was depressing. violent (!) and sarcastic.  Tasers were used.  TASERS!!!  Enough said.

Third, the Music:  GOOD.  Yes, mostly by Harry Connick, Jr., but not really showcased or featured as well as it could have been.  Not a great soundtrack, but okay, and definitely the best part of the movie.

What I wonder whenever I see something like this is, ""How did this film get made?""  Seriously.  There were a lot of talented people who worked hard and long on this thing, and it's atrocious.  At some point, surely someone had to notice just how bad it was turning out, and yet it was completed and sold.  Sad waste of time and effort by (presumably) caring people.  Perhaps it was made in China or another location where people don't ""get"" Christmas?  At any rate, I highly recommend you avoid this, even if you REALLY like Christmas movies and don't mind kind of bad ones.  If only I could erase this from my memory...",1322611200,9,2066,4.6143250688705235

2354066,1,B000A2XC12,"This movie is really not that great.  It's not awful, but it's just not great.  It definitely does not give you that warm, magical Christmas feeling.  The attitude and words coming from the kids' mouths is not very little kid friendly.  I promise you you'll be happier if you buy a different Christmas cartoon.",1320624000,5,310,4.685185185185185

2354068,5,B000A2XC12,"This movie is really cute. My 3 year old daughter loves all the characters and loves the music, of course who wouldn't with Harry Connick Jr. singing. We really enjoyed this animated Holiday movie. My daughter dances everytime we put this movie on. Fun for the whole family!",1288396800,,274,4.729166666666667
2354069,5,B000A2XC12,"A street musician with the voice and likeness of crooner Harry Connick, Jr. relays the story of a misfit elf to a sister and brother who think Christmas Eve is too late to get moved to Santa's naughty list. He tells the tale of Eubie, the happy elf, who is so gleeful that he annoys everyone else at the North Pole. When Eubie is moved to the list checking department, he discovers a town where all the children are on the naughty list. Eubie makes it his mission to travel to the town of Bluesville and find out what's wrong so that he can help make it right!

Featuring the original holiday music of my personal favorite singer, Harry Connick, Jr., ""The Happy Elf"" is a delightful new Christmas special for the whole family. Capturing some of that old Rankin/Bass holiday special magic (note that Mickey Rooney, who plays Santa here, played him more than once for Rankin/Bass), this new, computer animated special provides impressive animation and plenty of laughs and smiles, plus the great music you'd expect from Harry, whose ""Happy Elf"" song was the inspiration for this special. The 45-minute movie features an impressive cast, with Harry as the narrator and Mickey Rooney as Santa, Carol Kane as Eubie's best friend, Gilda, Lewis Black as Norbert the elf, animation fave Rob Paulsen as Eubie, and more! The DVD offers both enhanced widescreen and fullscreen presentations and a plethora of bonus features. There's a thorough storyboard presentation, trailer, character gallery, behind the scenes interview with Harry Connick, Jr., the ""build an elf"" game (which is a short but amusing mix and match game), and several DVD-Rom/printable features (such as coloring pages, games, and holiday cards). And, the slip cover even lights up and plays a bit of the title song, if you can still get one with the slip cover that is!

""The Happy Elf"" is definitely a DVD to pick up if you're looking for a new holiday special in the style of the R/B classics and is certainly a much better choice than most of the recent, wannabe sequels to those beloved specials. You don't even have to be a fan of Harry Connick, Jr. to enjoy this one, as it is more about the story than anything else and doesn't feel bogged down with forced musical numbers like some specials of the kind. Of course, it doesn't hurt to be a fan of Harry's, and if you find yourself loving the jazzy Happy Elf song, you may want to pick up his other Christmas DVD, ""Harry for the Holidays."" I also highly recommend his CD of the same title, and even more, his first Christmas CD, ""When My Heart Finds Christmas."" I just wish the holiday special that came out with that CD would come to DVD too!",1199318400,,2658,4.629237288135593
2354089,5,B000A2XC12,"I purchased this DVD last week even though I had never heard of it before. I hadn't watched it yet, and the other night I was curious to see what people said about it. After reading the ""review"" from the lady that said it was ""Disgusting"", I was completely bummed and hesitant to watch the movie. Well, I just got done watching it, and now I am left wondering....LADY, DID WE WATCH THE SAME MOVIE??

First of all, in the beginning when the little girl says ""shut up"", it was said in the context of ""nooo way"", which is how kid's say it these days. And it was the ONLY time it was said. There is NO bad language, and NO HISSING CHILDREN.

It was a cute Christmas movie, with a happy conquers sad theme. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to share it with my nieces and nephews.

As for it being scary, the only way your child will ""soil their pants"" is if your child is scared of candy and puppy dogs!!!",1194134400,52,902,4.142857142857143
2354090,4,B000A2XC12,"The children (ages 2-3) love this movie, and request to watch it all the time.  It is a very cute movie, but the little girl in the beginning of the movie says ""Shut up!"", which is something I don't want the kids to pick up.  Overall, the kids love it, and I recommend this movie as a very cute, slightly cheesy Christmas movie.",1167177600,,328,4.190476190476191
2354091,3,B000A2XC12,"It was a good movie for my 7 year old - cheesy for me .  . . Most of the movies I can sit through, Dora, Barbie, My little Pony .  . . but I couldn't sit through this one.  The good thing is it's not that long . . . so you won't be overwhelmed.

It's OK - not bad, but I wouldn't suggest for them to PICK that one . . . maybe I'd hide it for a few months to save myself!!  LOL",1166918400,3,376,3.3255813953488373
2354092,5,B000A2XC12,"Add this to your list of favorite Christmas programs! After seeing the show on NBC, I had to own it for my 9 year old daughter (OK, so it was really for me!)

This is a very cute show based on a toe-tapping song by the incomparable Harry Connick Jr. Watch as Eubie the Elf tries to spread a little holiday cheer and niceness. Go out and get yours today- you won't want to wait until next year to see this!",1135900800,12,405,4.0
2354093,5,B000A2XC12,"Harry Connick Jr! Isn't that enough! Okay, so I'm a big fan of the man, but this show's pretty good on its own, although the music and narration wouldn't be the same without him.

Forty-five minutes is a little shorter than I cared for, but that's what they gave us (an extra few minutes wouldn't have hurt much). We get to follow a Happy Little Elf called Eubie who tries to make some naughty kids turn nice. Not too sappy, and still a possible Christmas classic.

The DVD set's not too shabby. Aside from the film there are quite a few extras including a box that lights up and plays a little tidbit from the theme music.

There are quite a few good laughs in here. This film is very suitable for the older kids, but not for babies; teens and adults with a since of humor will also enjoy this flick. It will even be nice throughout the year!",1135814400,19,843,4.25625
2354094,5,B000A2XC12,"The Happy Elf was given to me by a friend as a Christmas gift. I have to admit I had not heard of it, even though it made an appearance on NBC. I really enjoyed the 3-D action. The story was good enough to entertain me for the whole 45 minutes. Harry Conick Jr. did an excellent job with the narration and the music! He pinned the whole original score, and I really enjoyed that.

The DVD set came in a neat box that lights up and plays some of the original soundtrack. There are also great extras including an interview with Harry Conick Jr. and a CD-Rom that allows you to make your own Christmas cards, this will come in handy for next Christmas!

This is a fun movie for old and young (but maybe not too young). I believe that all who like to be entertained, and kind of dig Christmas will enjoy this creative show!",1135814400,4,819,4.177215189873418
2354095,5,B000A2XC12,The Happy Elf is an instant classic and comparable to the Christmas standards of Rudolph and Frosty. Harry Connick Jr. leads an excellent vocal cast in the spinning of tale of an erratic elf who brings Christmas to an isolated town that is somehow off of Santa's map. Definitely watch and listen for the great performances of the extremely talented and underrated Carol Kane and Lewis Black. This is a great purchase for a family celebration any time of the year.,1135728000,2,463,4.728395061728395
2354096,5,B000A2XC12,"I truly adored Harry Connick Jr.'s charming animated film, The Happy Elf.  As a serious fan of his artistry, Connick successful narrates, executive produces, and provides all the original music for this new NBC holiday show/DVD, based on his wonderful song.  The story is endearing and the characters are adorable and comical.  The plot is very easy to follow and flows very well from scene to scene.  The music featured is upbeat and inspiring.  The story and its music truly get me into the Christmas mood and spirit.  Although this is more of kid's film, but adults can still relate to the messages of being good all year round that their children will pick up along Eubie's journey.  This bright and light-hearted film has already became one of my all time Christmas favorites, along with A Christmas Story, Miracle on 38th Street, Love Actually, The Polar Express, A Christmas Carol, and It's a Wonderful Life!  The DVD has numerous great features, including all kinds of fun games for the kids to play - Eubie's Gift Grab, a North Pole Puzzle Game, Printable Holiday Cards, and a Bluesville Coloring Book!!!  I highly recommend this film to light up anyone's holiday spirit and warm your heart!",1135296000,2,1200,4.8431372549019605
2354097,5,B000A2XC12,"The Happy Elf will definitely make everyone happy specially during this holiday season.  Im not a big fan of animated films but ""The Happy Elf"" definitely entertained me .. oh yeah! ... Im so happy we are able to find a film that everyone in the family can agree on.  Kids, Teens, and Adults :D This is one thing I will not forget to bring out during our in house christmas parties this yr :D",1135123200,2,392,4.213333333333333
2354108,1,B000A2XC12,"I made the mistake of sitting my nieces down and sharing this DVD with them, presuming from the packaging that it was some kind of sweetness-and-light Christmas fluff tale for little kiddies.  I am so regretful I did so.

This film should be eternally banned.  Except, perhaps, in Hell - the same place where it was undoubtedly born.

Imagine how horrified I was when we'd gotten halfway through the program and all I could hear was the evil hissing noises the inhabitants of Blueville make with their nasty, misshapen little mouths.  Sometimes I thought their heads were about to spontaneously combust, only to have serpentine entities erupt from their severed necks.  One of the girls could not help but stare at the excruciating little characters with a pitiful mix of terror and rapture.  Needless to say, ""Yuletide nightmares"" prevailed that night -- and for many more to come!

And the LANGUAGE!  What sort of producers allow such filth to spew forth from an ANIMATED CARTOON __AIMED AT YOUNG CHILDREN__?!

It was utterly inappropriate and unacceptable.

At least Eubie (the eponymous ""Happy Elf"") is cheery and bright -- but the violence that erupts when Santa's Swap team swarms the city is positively nightmarish!  Tasers, pepper spray, and battering rams were deployed at full tilt.  While I was slightly mollified that those dirty little filthpots were [at last] put in their place, it was certainly at a cost -- poor little Susie soiled her panties when she was subjected to those scenes!

S-O-I-L-E-D!!!

Unless you have rabid little monsters in your charge who are utterly desensitized to violent, evil television programming -- do NOT allow your children to see this mess!",1135036800,9,1687,4.996415770609319
2354109,5,B000A2XC12,"This is truly a wonderful family Christmas movie.  The character Eubie is adorable and lovable.  He spreads good cheer to a town called ""Bluesville"".  They are a town of very unhappy people and thru Eubie and his antics they become a happier town.  My kids down right belly laugh at Eubie and his dances and facial expressions.  The Happy Elf will always be apart of our Christmas movie collection.",1134950400,2,398,4.7101449275362315
2354110,2,B000A2XC12,"We watched this with our kids one evening.  It was a decent movie, certainly not the high quality of the christmas classics.  When Eubie the elf went down to help the small town get off the naughty list, the Santa security team arrives to take him back to the north pole, not with a net, or a bag but with a TASER GUN.  They shocked him with it, or so you assume because they show him blacking out after they ""Zap"" it into the air. It was not the type of thing I had expected to have to explain to my young kids while watching a christmas cartoon about a happy elf.  It was in very bad taste.",1134950400,15,592,3.9915254237288136
2354111,5,B000A2XC12,"""The Happy Elf"" debuts as yet another holiday special for the family - but this isn't a run of the mill show.  The Christmas theme gets made over with high tech computer animation and a star packed cast featuring Harry Connick Jr., Carol Kane, Mickey Rooney, and more.  The delightful animations show a myriad of nuanced facial expressions that draw the viewer into the story.  The festive Christmas songs are also a great touch that really put the icing on the cake!  This DVD is great holiday fun for the whole family.

The story centers around the elf Eubie, who undertakes the massive task of bringing the Christmas spirit to the aptly-named Bluesville.  This sets the stage for Eubie's ebuillent optimism versus the staid conventions of the townspeople.  The typical ""fish out of water"" motif gets made over as both the North Pole and Bluesville become frustrated with Eubie's unbridled enthusiasm and determination to do what he knows is right.  The plot is a wondeful Christmas fable that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

This DVD does a great job of carrying on the traditions set forth by such 60's classics as ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Frosty the Snowman,"" adding a modern touch to the medium without losing any of the features that keep this cartoons near and dear to our hearts.  The songs, comedy, and adventure all add up to one irresistibly fresh take on Christmas!  The DVD also includes entertaining extras such as a fullscreen or widescreen options, games, storyboards, cards, a coloring book, interviews, and more!  Buy this DVD and bring Christmas joy to your family for years to come!",1134864000,,1623,4.840579710144928

2354113,5,B000A2XC12,"I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of X-mas(because I find it too commercial and somewhat depressing), X-mas movies or music, or Harry Connick Jr.  But while flipping through the channels recently, I saw The Happy Elf on, and since there was nothing else I wanted to watch, I decided to give it a chance... and man am I glad that I did.  I thought that the story was very touching in many ways.  I liked the reaction of the kids in Bluesville when Eubie first came to town, and I loved the scene where Eubie gets his elf hat taken from him as a punishment of sorts.  Curtis was my favorite character, though his part wasn't huge, it was very sweet to see someone that reminded me of me, and a ""goth"" character who wasn't depressed all the time, but actually a member of the Bluesville Secret Society of Happy People!!  So I definitely have to recommend this movie to everyone, not just as a great X-mas movie, or a great animated movie, but as a great story and a great movie all around!!",1134345600,2,994,4.238095238095238
