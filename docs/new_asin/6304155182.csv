It is music, adorable and very real children of daycare age.  They sing, they dance, they interact with the music... no Barney here....just plain little kids doing what little kids do best.  We even use this for a family tape- sit down and watch the dancing babies.  It is a joy to see a short video with is such a spirit lifter.  And my kids loved to see children just like themselves and their friends.",1378771200,,565,4.333333333333333
