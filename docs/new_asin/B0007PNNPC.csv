8050383,5,B0007PNNPC,"This is a must-see for anyone seriously contemplating a trek to the summit of Kilimanjaro.  The videography is less-than-professional but nonetheless very good; more importantly the general ""feel"" for what to expect, for the sights and sounds and the preparations needed are what are the most important aspects of this DVD.  My friends and I viewed this several times prior to our own trip in February 2006.  It helped us prepare in terms of clothing and also just in terms of expectations, of ""getting a feel"" for what we had in store for us.  Of the 9 of us that started the climb, 5 of us made the summit of Kilimanjaro (Uhuru Peak)  on February 13, 2006.  This video provided us with good information that I believe helped pave the way for our successful trek.  Highly recommended for anyone planning on a Kilimanjaro trek!",1192233600,2,827,4.701388888888889
8050384,4,B0007PNNPC,"This is a very interesting presentation --not polished-- but very informative from a boots-on-the-ground trekker's perspective.

I'm hoping they produce a DVD for the Machame-ascent/Mweka-descent.  Don't forget to visit their website ([...]); it's loaded with information.

I have the other two popular DVDs on Kilimanjaro ('To the Roof of Africa' and 'Volcano Above the Clouds'), but this one might be my favorite due to it's unique point-of-view.",1175126400,2,448,5.656716417910448
8050385,4,B0007PNNPC,"If you're considering a trek up Kilimanjaro - this video is a nice overview of the Western Breach route, and informative on what to expect from a competent outfitter.  Take notes and you'll probably have some good questions to ask an outfitter (regardless of the route you take) before making your deposit.  For that reason alone it is worthwhile.

The only caveats:

- It's produced by a Kili outfitter.  Naturally there is some bias toward their company.  That element doesn't overly dominate To their credit, they seem to offer some compelling services - an all-inclusive package, chemical toilets, showers, that many outfitters omit.

- This is not a glitzy docu-film like the IMAX video that's available.  It doesn't really compromise the video - but it's worthwhile to have your expectations in check.  Most of the video is shot handheld with associated narration, and some of the maps and similar are actual video of a paper map.  The upside to this is that it comes across a bit more 'real' than a high-dollar production.

If you're considering a trek up Kilimanjaro and haven't done a lot of research - this is probably a good place to start.",1156118400,5,1151,4.821428571428571
8050386,5,B0007PNNPC,"I have gone up twice ... the second time with Kiliwarriors. The IMAX movie is instructional about the mountain but does NOT show the climb the ""way it is"". This DVD shows the routes clearly on maps and conditions to expect and food, tents, etc.  Maybe more importantly it shows some of the often overlooked dangers.  It will show you questions to ask a potential outfitter. It goes through a recommended guide for equipment to bring with you. Having gone with Kiliwarriors I now know they are the supreme caretakers of climbing companies bar none. I highly recommend the DVD and the company that made it.",1125964800,15,604,4.688679245283019
