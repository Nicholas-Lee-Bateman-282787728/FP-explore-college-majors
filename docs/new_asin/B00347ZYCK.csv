8388247,3,B00347ZYCK,"It is a dark story about a family who just can't get along.  The film builds slowly - too slow for my taste.  There's no excitement, really, not much suspense.  The killing is rather direct and anticipated with very scarce surprises.  The movie was ok, but not anything great.",1494547200,,276,4.571428571428571
8388248,3,B00347ZYCK,This movie isn't bad but like always Amazon surprised me with a movie in a case that was an original bluray when they first arrived on the market. Its thick plastic is heavy and cheap. Quality control means nothing to Amazon.,1432080000,,225,4.512195121951219
8388249,4,B00347ZYCK,"if you don't know about Troma and the gems they've put out and brought to the big screen and to dvd then you probably aren't going to be in love with this movie.

Troma is behind the toxic avenger, tromeo and juliet, poultrygiest, cannibal the musical, surf nazi's must die, and more than 100 other campy b-movies, lloyd kauffman the king of troma is a genuinely nice guy who loves making and supporting the movies troma releases and does it all for the joy of film, you could do worse than watching something he's behind and lending a little support to the independant side of film.

if you like gory campy movies then get it, watch it, enjoy it. If you want to watch something with a 4 million dollar a film actor falling in love/dealing with a highschool dilemma/being the only person who can see a ghost who's ruining their life but ultimately makes them realize its time to change their life for the better/realizing that they're in love with the best friend they have who is getting married in a month! don't buy it, go hit up netflix and watch some formula movie..",1295827200,3,1071,4.487179487179487
8388250,2,B00347ZYCK,"Where can I begin to describe all the shortcomings of this wretched movie ?  I have a strong feeling that most of the ""actors"" are rank amateurs, probably relatives or (former) friends of the director. The ""plot"" makes absolutely no sense largely because the ""actors"" mumble their lines with thick British (I guess) accents and most of the poorly recorded dialog is unintelligible, but I will valiantly try to provide an overview: Two old people are killed in an old house, apparently in Scotland. We have absolutely no idea who they are or why they are killed. We never do. The murders are very poorly staged and completely unconvincing. We begin to feel that we have made a big mistake by ordering this title from Netflix. We yawn.

Then we join a family as they ride and bicker in a car. This scene goes on and on and on. We yawn again. From what little of their dialog I could understand, the conversation is entirely pointless and boring. They hit a bird, watch it die, and bury it. This is the high point of movie, but disgusting to anyone who loves animals. While all human-directed violence is either off screen or utterly fake, in this case they actually half-kill a bird and then show it slowly dying in agony. The scene is effective simply because it is the only realistic, moving event in the whole silly production. In effect, the bird steals the show....but it dies, and now we are stuck with a bunch of mumbling, amateur actors and are in big trouble with our family for picking this vile movie.

Then we are back to the old house and two more people are killed. I have no idea who these people are or why they are now in the house, or why they are killed. We never do. Again, their murders are so poorly staged that they are almost laughable, much like those depicted in 1960's grade-Z teenage drive-in movies. You almost wish they would kill another bird....almost.

At some point, I fell asleep for a while or passed out from boredom. When I regained consciousness, I was the only one still watching, and there were some bugs in jars, two more murders, I think, or perhaps I was dreaming, and then the family arrives at the house and....SPOILER ALERT (AS IF ANYONE CARES) the killer (sporting a really bad haircut) arrives, kills the step-father off screen (to save production costs) and then is stabbed to death by the mother. He doesn't get back up and continue his inexplicable mayhem, like you hope and expect, he is just dead, with a really bad haircut.

The mother then checks on the safety of the two hiding children, no doubt expecting kudos for her heroism, but instead, the unappreciative brats apparently kill her with a crossbow. Its hard to say for sure because of the lousy staging. Their motivation....only God and the director can guess. After this heinous act, the children simply walk outside and off screen. To where, you ask? I reply: who cares?

If all this makes absolutely no sense at all, then I have accurately described the ""plot"", which isn't easy to do. On the good side, however, this is a very short movie, not much more than 70 minutes. You may alienate your family, but it presents a good opportunity for a short nap.

In conclusion, this movie is a complete disaster. I gave it two stars simply because the photography, particularly of the sea coast, was beautiful and the bird was a great actor. Based on the human acting, dialog, direction, plot, and overall entertainment value however, it deserves absolutely no stars at all.",1286496000,9,3480,4.621359223300971
