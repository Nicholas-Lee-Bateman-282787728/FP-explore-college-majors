3647892,5,B001IDW0SS,My only complaint is to Discovery for not formatting these episodes in HD. They have cropped the SD with a letter box.

3647893,5,B001IDW0SS,"Depressed about season 19 being the last one. My entire adult life has had one constant thing - the Mythbusters. I even visited M5 once. You could call me a super fan. You can learn a lot form them about life and science.  They have invaded every aspect of the American culture and I am sad to see them go. I watched there show so many times my son has to watch it every time before he goes to bed. Thanks to them my son loves science and math.  It is fun to watch them stumble through things as they learn - you learn with them, it is like a voyage of discovery.  What they have achieved with this show has expanded human knowledge for the better. This show will be sadly missed, it was not just fun to watch be you learned a lot and some of of there experiments save the life's. Before the Mythbusters the only good show to watch about science was Bill Nye the Science Guy and you didn't learn a lot from him but you sure did learn a lot from the Mythbusters. I wish that the Discovery Channel wood keep the show going for another 19 seasons. ""Thank you Jamie Adams Tory grant and kari. It was fun to watch you guys learn can achieve new things in your lives I wish you well and anything you do for the rest your lives thank you.""",1451001600,,1232,4.082644628099174

3647895,5,B001IDW0SS,"I have always been a fan of Mythbusters. I bought the episode ""Hindenburg Mysteries"" from Season 5. This episode is especially awesome because there is cross disciplinary content: history, chemistry, and biology. My accelerated chemistry students enjoyed watching the entire episode and thought that the jokes were funny. I like that they had a mini experiment about crocs and alligators throughout the episode which made for nice breaks from the feature about the blimp tragedy.

I love how Adam and Jamie, with the help of other crew, explain and test different mysteries. They do a fantastic job with detailing why they are setting up their experiments in certain ways and it's very entertaining! I've watched episodes from different seasons and I can say that Mythbusters never gets old!",1446940800,,791,5.1796875

3647901,5,B001IDW0SS,"MythBusters kick ass. Nothing more to say. After Season 5 they seemed to focusing less on the builds which is a bit disappointing, but apparently they are revamping the show to go back to Season 1-3 style. Minus Kari, Tori and Grant :/",1422403200,,235,4.488372093023256
3647902,5,B001IDW0SS,"Season 5 episode 17, when they test super hero myths.  I'd have to disagree on their ""busted"" decision on if you can leave a ring imprint/scar on skin with a punch.  Being a Cubs fan I decided to wear Minnesota Twins gear to a White Sox game some years back.  White Sox fans being notoriously classy hated me and I loved it.  One guy got a little too much liquid courage served to him and decided he wanted to fight right then and there.  While the result of the fight was me laughing it off and him running away to avoid security he did manage to get one decent punch in square on my forehead (don't ask how he managed to hit me on the forehead).  I was wearing a Twins hat with the ""TC"" logo for Twin Cities.  The next day I definitely had little scabs and definite redness that CLEARLY read ""TC.""  It was hilarious.  It lasted only a couple days but the imprint was definitely there, and I would imagine if this guy wasn't 1) so drunk, 2) 5 feet 4 inches tall, and 3) landed a better punch with legitimate umph behind it I would most definitely believe I would've been left with a bloody thick scab of TC on my forehead.  I can only imagine what one can do with a metal ring and I would imagine it wouldn't take that much force to leave a scab, and definitely not that much force to leave the punched person bloody.  That being said, leaving a perfect imprinted SCAR seems unlikely.  You'd have to pretty much break the skin in the exact shape of the ring.  Odds are you'd just pierce the skin and leave a gash.  The SOFTER you punch though I'd imagine would leave I nice ring shaped welt.  If you wanted to leave a perfect scar you'd have to pretty much be as precise as scarification artists.  You'd be better off making a ring that has a lifted surface.  Then that lifted surface with the design on it needs to be able to heat up and you can press it to the ""bad guy's"" face, burning him which would leave a scar..... AKA branding.",1419638400,,1937,4.191891891891892
3647903,4,B001IDW0SS,"My favorite part of the episode is the test of whether or not a falling frozen turkey can injure a human's foot or, even better, a nosy pet looking for scraps of food. Well done, Mythbusters!",1419379200,,191,4.333333333333333

We have been watching these old episodes for free for several months. My young grandson loves to watch them together with me. All of the sudden this week, we now have to pay for every episode, when we have been watching them for free previously. This makes no sense to us.

3647958,5,B001IDW0SS,"Mythbusters is a really great program to show my ninth grade physical science students in order for them to grasp the concepts of turgor pressure, force, motion power, torque and gravity. It definitely made my lessons easier to explain and relate to.",1379376000,,250,4.976190476190476
3647959,3,B001IDW0SS,This episode is glitched! halfway through it skipped 2-5 minutes. They're talking about the pidgeons and then suddenly it's bi-furcated boat? With no introduction like they always do.. and the voices glitch too.,1378512000,,211,5.424242424242424
3647960,4,B001IDW0SS,Good subject mater and presentation.  The show has always been a favorite of mine.  I can recommend it to everyone.,1378425600,,115,4.7

3647970,5,B001IDW0SS,"As usual, the myths vary in complexity but the crew always keep it interesting. The ever-present element of the joy of science in the pursuit of the silly (and social, and historic) is one of the reasons to watch this show and since they got rid of the interpersonal friction element first season, pretty much any season is going to have great stuff.
Only one warning to newcomers to the DVDs, though. Be very careful when shopping: the majority of the shows came out only in ""collections"" which are NOT full seasons. They're annoying, selected episode versions of the show, and have fewer per set. And as much as I love Mythbusters, I admit watching the same 8 shows over and over and over eventually loses even my interest. Look for complete seasons.",1374883200,3,752,4.661654135338346

3647980,3,B001IDW0SS,"This program keeps stretching the boundaries until sometimes I wonder if anything makes sense. Explosions for explosion's sake being one of my major objections since it doesn't even relate to the original subject (usually). Having said that, I suppose there is entertainment value in all of this, even though the original idea of debunking important myths seems to have been put aside in favor or slapstick comedy.",1369872000,,414,5.1940298507462686
