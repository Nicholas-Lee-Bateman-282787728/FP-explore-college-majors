7921476,2,B00004RXB4,"Jakobowsky und der Oberst / Me and the Colonel, 1958 film

This was adapted from a Broadway play from the early 1940s. Can the war in Europe be used as the background for comedy? It is set in Paris. Colonel Tadeusz Prakozhny wants to escape the Nazi invasion. Mr. Jakubowsky, a resourceful man, also wants to escape (he has fled from other countries earlier). The humor comes from the contrast between two persons: a strong military man and a smart civilian named Samuel Jakubowsky. Both are from the town of Boradinko (one is the son of a landowner, the other a teacher). The Colonel is bigoted aristocrat, Jakubowsky is a Jew. When a country is invaded all must work together. Jakubowsky obtains an automobile to travel to neutral Spain, but the Colonel wants to meet his Lady Love. [Are the characters stereotypes? Note the differences from earlier movies from the 1940s. Are the characters believable?]

The Colonel travels to a restaurant to meet his wife. A German Major visits this inn as well! Then a French tank arrives on the road. Can Jakubowsky turn vodka into gasoline? Yes, if he is resourceful. They find refuge in a castle. Jakubowsky is ""a genius"" for this scheme. The Colonel is upset at this! His lady friend recognizes Sam's intelligence. Is that thunder in the distance? The Colonel insists on a duel. But it ends in the cellar near a cask of wine. There are new visitors, they requisition the castle for German soldiers. Jakubowsky and the Colonel must leave again. A roadblock stops them and takes them to that German Major (who is looking for Colonel Prakozhny). ""He is my cousin."" ""There is no accounting for taste."" The Major decides to release them and provide transport. Colonel Prakozhny was speechless.

[Do their characters seem consistent?] Jakubowsky walks away; later a car gives him a ride to a town. Two soldiers bring him to an office for questioning about the Colonel. The Germans want to stop Prakozhny before he leaves for England. Two men follow Jakubowsky to see where he goes. The French Resistance warns the Colonel. Jakubowsky sits in the town square. The Colonel joins him (he knows he is being watched). ""Every good soldier has a counter-strategy."" A Staff Officer devises strategy. The Gestapo watched them walk away and follows them to a convent. Their car is followed when it leaves. ""Something is wrong!"" A bicycle brings Jakubowsky and the Colonel to the beach so he and the Colonel and his lady friend can travel to England in a submarine. There is only room for two in this boat. ""Come back soon!"" Who has those papers?

Danny Kaye was better known for his comedy roles. Curt Jurgens plays the Colonel. Two possibilities are: you either love or hate this story. This mixes drama and comedy in a tragic situation that isn't believable. A Colonel who is important would not have to leave the country on his own at this time of the war; the story seems implausible to me. Would an important office drink so much as to incapacitate himself? Note the underplayed Gestapo official ""a technician who gets people to talk"". This story seems outdated by the 1950s. There are better World War II stories made during this time.",1388793600,,3169,4.766848816029144
7921477,5,B00004RXB4,"I've read the other reviews and echo their sentiments.  I too saw this movie many many years ago on late night TV.  I fell in love with it immediately.  So I lament the really stupid title because it makes the movie sound lame instead of the beautiful combination of acting, story and script that should be in everyone's top 25 films.  It's funny, warm and sweet without being schlocky or corny.  In the cathedral of my heart, a candle will always be burning for it.  It is available (if you are lucky enough to find it) in VHS.  But, as the movie teaches, in life there are always two possibilities.  I'm waiting for the DVD.",1152576000,,626,4.3826086956521735
