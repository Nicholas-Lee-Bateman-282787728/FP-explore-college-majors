Humphrey Bogart was a bad guy and was great as always.  The quality was excellent.  I was very pleased.  I would like to see more Billy Halop movies on DVD with this kind of quality.",1336435200,9,336,4.015151515151516
5026137,3,B006WQUL64,"The problem with this film is not its source,it actually comes from a play,its just its very stereotyped and it is didactic in ways and tries to look at the world of 1930's at things that were rifling throughout the society of the times and show where true virtues and values lie? Being really a look at human nature the tale is still worth viewing today. Bogart plays the role of gangster frank wilson with much pizzazz and at film's end his role is the one we recall most but first we begin with a youth whoose family is moving to the environs of Boston, a new city with a new life. New jobs, the youngster has a new life and his sister who plays a guardian type role in this film, a role and type fast disappearing from our world,and families,and she knows his ties and she wants to make her brother best
man at her wedding,and restore the family much in the values of the america at the time,with family virtues,working hard and Boston,the heart of america which stands up for the values of the republic. Unfortunately the youth takes in the the values of mobster frank wilson,and there are a string of holdups and a murder. The film does show the youth trusts in and enjoys the gangster's company,and does show in early scenes how the mobster nurtures crime like atttudes in him,how hard criminals are not really in jail. Anyways they end up caught,and there are good scenes in prison in youth relating to librarian among library type setting. Also theme of an innocent man accused of murder,or the boy but not the real murderer...whom they should naturally pigeon hole! There is a prison break in which frank wilson the bogart character kills the youth,,,but the youth redeems himself in society's eyes by telling us the true murderer and that crime does not pay...and he dies building a better society and world...the only problem and why we may consider this grade b we don't know how this transformation and change comes about...and the events portrayed end up more didactic than real life or realistic...too many in prisons are hardened under the same circumstances...but short film and prison break greatly dramatized in best of warner traditions. No one does film better than warner's of this type...there better films are more realistic!!",1334793600,3,2251,4.715736040609137
5026138,4,B006WQUL64,"good B-movie,just about what you know you will get from a crime drama from WB at this time in movie history. The only huge surprise is Bogie playing a dirty rat! LOL!",1334620800,6,166,4.21875
8505808,3,B006WQUL64,"This gangster movie from 1939 is a bit over-dramatic at times but good fun.  Humphrey Bogart is just about always fun to watch, including here.  Bill Halop's character -- a young wanna-be gangster punk -- had that New Yawk accent going pretty good and was not someone to feel much sympathy for.  A good deal of the movie takes place in a prison.  Three stars, but a solid three stars.",1484092800,,384,4.442857142857143

8505814,5,B006WQUL64,Is it Bogie's best?  No.  But even a not-so-great Humphrey Bogart movie is better than most other movies.  I am so glad to have this movie in my collection.,1396310400,,156,4.310344827586207
