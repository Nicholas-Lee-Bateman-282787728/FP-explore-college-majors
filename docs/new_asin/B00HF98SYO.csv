6161395,5,B00HF98SYO,"I just don't get the marketing strategy behind ""splitting up"" Season 5 into two separate volumes for no logical reason.  Last year,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Aliens-Season-5-Volume-1/dp/B00DEKKFBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Aliens: Season 5 Volume 1</a>&nbsp;came out on DVD only in standard definition even though it had apparently included ALL 12 episodes of Season 5 that were broadcast.

With Season 6 currently being broadcast on H2, it would seem that they are finally releasing a Season 5 Volume 2 (2 as in ""DOUBLE DIP"") but we are at least getting a proper High Definition 1080p Bluray release. But what episodes are we getting exactly here?  The same 12 episodes that were included in Volume 1, as Ancient Astronaut Theorists contend? [UPDATE: According to H2's episode guide the 8 episodes on this 2-disc set are from the first half of Season 6!?!?!?]

Even Giorgio must be scratching his head.

Now, I'm not saying it was Aliens, but...",1390348800,38,1012,5.72

6161415,4,B00HF98SYO,"Just finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season 5: Volume 2"" released by the History Channel.
Satan it seems was an Ancient Alien!  No, no I kid you not.  According to the hoot nanny of the episode titled ""The Satan Conspiracy,"" Satan was actually an ancient alien who was trying to help mankind; but was vilified by the fellow aliens that he betrayed!
With this season of episodes, ""Ancient Aliens"" is giving viewers new twists and turns not only on recycled material - like that about the Anunnaki - but it takes a look at the Crystal Skulls, and explores the connection of the Trinity with aliens.  Oh yes, and ancient surgical techniques are explored and attributed to those absent ancient aliens.
Even with the new opening graphics and twisting turning tales of alien encounters during prehistory, Ancient Aliens never quiet manages to convince anyone with conclusive evidence - like a prehistoric school with modern-type fillings.  Still it's harmless fun.
Recommended.

I am Catholic, believe in God, but I know that some of the things on this earth could not have been done by people with that level of development. NO REAL CONSTRUCTION FROM THE GREEKS ON  was done without the muscle that hydraulics provide. The aqueducts, coliseum and the great Cathedrals took a long time and by todays standards easily done. We have the Channel tunnel, sports stadiums and large office buildings which were done much quicker. But we have nothing like the pyramids built in various places.

Myth, history, alternative history, conspiracy, suppressed history and archaeology, bigfoot, fringe science, angels, ufo's and of course, aliens.  I am a fairly open minded person so I am willing to take a leap of faith to follow some of the topics and see the dots connected.  That doesn't mean I believe all of it though.  The show itself is very well produced and written.  One of the best things about this show for me is that I have found a number of the commentators on the show are authors.  With the wide range of topics covered by the show I have found about a dozen authors I have now read books by.  Another really cool thing about this show are the locations they occasionally cover and travel to.  Some are rarely covered or visited by other television or radio shows. All in all I would recommend this show to anyone with even the slightest interest in the fringe sciences, esoteric topics,cryoptozoology and yes, aliens.",1405555200,4,1065,4.682795698924731

  2.  The series is interesting if you have an open mind (even skeptics will find it interesting)
  3.  The series is an amazing travelogue of places you may otherwise never be able to visit
  4.  The narrators are intelligent, well spoken, and excited about the topics
  5.  The series is just flat-out fun to watch

  This entire series is a winner",1400803200,,424,4.5
6161522,5,B00HF98SYO,I try to catch these as soon as they are released. The production quality keeps getting better and better with each new release. I never seem to tire of this topic.,1400803200,,164,4.32258064516129
6161523,5,B00HF98SYO,This series is so interesting. So many things that were never taught in school that should be. Time for science to get with the program and start looking at what is right in front of them. I recommend this to anyone with an open mind.,1400716800,,234,4.222222222222222
6161524,5,B00HF98SYO,"I love this series. True mysteries and enigmas. Can't wait for the next one.
You get hooked by trying to find explanations.",1400716800,,123,4.636363636363637
6161525,4,B00HF98SYO,This is great stuff .really makes you think I can't wait to see all the seasons once I started watching I couldn't stop,1400371200,,119,4.217391304347826
6161526,5,B00HF98SYO,All the seasons are great including this one! This has made me a believer that we are not alone in this universe!,1400284800,,113,4.181818181818182
6161527,5,B00HF98SYO,How can you go wrong.?  Each season gets better and better!  I will continue to get each season for sure.,1400112000,,105,4.2
6161528,2,B00HF98SYO,It seems they are running out of material and rehashing some old stuff. Plus they use to put the whole season in one package but now they want to make more money by separating the season into volumes. I think the series is on its last legs. I wasted money buying this.,1400112000,3,268,4.173076923076923
6161529,5,B00HF98SYO,"Love the series. So I am collecting all the DVDs for the series.
Wish they were Blue-ray for the price.",1399766400,,103,4.2
6161530,5,B00HF98SYO,Very good. Good quality. Cant afford to watch it on TV any more so I bought it.  Love having all of them to watch anytime I want.,1399507200,,129,3.7777777777777777
6161531,5,B00HF98SYO,"Season 5 is just as exciting and informative as previous seasons, excellent show! I recommend this to everyone. High quality entertainment!",1399334400,,139,5.666666666666667
6161532,2,B00HF98SYO,"I rated this two stars for a couple of reasons.

First, it's the same old rehashed information that they have been going on about for 5 years or more. It's time to either add some new information or, gasp, end the series. I can remember anticipating the new Ancient Alien shows and making sure my calendar was cleared so that I was home to watch it when it came on. Now I am ambivalent about the new shows so maybe it's just my tastes changing?

Second, this particular set of DVD's is terrible from a technical perspective. There's about 10 minutes of commercials before the menu comes up (and the menu is locked out until the commercials are finished). Give me a break. I purchase the DVD's to avoid commercials and feel like I am getting ripped off when you stuff the front end with crappy commercials.

Additionally, the default setting for the DVD is to have the subtitles locked 'ON'. I have to remember to go through the menu system and shut the subtitles off before I play the show otherwise I have to go back to the menu and start all over again.

Also, there are many, many, many, freezes in the program before the next scene. This is irritating as it can get. You would think that after 5 seasons the programmers would have figured out how to segue from one scene to the next without coming to a hard pause. The hard pauses make watching the show tedious and less enjoyable.

Finally, why was season 5 split into two different volumes? All the other seasons are one volume even though there are 3 or 4 DVD's in each set. This is a mystery as onerous as the mystery as to whether humans were developed by alien species to only mine gold or was there some other more nefarious reason? Hmm.... I guess I'll have to watch Ancient Aliens Season 6 to find out that answer.",1399161600,26,1777,4.3890577507598785
6161533,5,B00HF98SYO,This series always presents information that is balanced and helpful in understanding the continuing history of Star Beings on this planet.,1398902400,,139,5.666666666666667
6161534,5,B00HF98SYO,I can't wait for season six to come out on dvd.  So I can see what furthur evidence and proof that Aliens have visit humanity in the distant past.,1398643200,,146,4.0344827586206895
6161535,5,B00HF98SYO,"I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good so I'm very satisfied with this purchase!",1398384000,,196,4.96969696969697
6161536,4,B00HF98SYO,"I have in the past said that this series was getting old because it seemed like they were just repeating themselves, however they seem to have moved forward in this series. It's still the best of it's kind and far better than the abundance of knock offs and seminars that have been appearing disguised as documentaries. I have also been reading up on several of their experts and they appear to be true believers who have been studying this field for many many years. Others are merely jumping on the bandwagon, spo beware pof the college professors trying to cash in on a movement!",1398297600,2,582,4.605769230769231
6161537,5,B00HF98SYO,"As a ancient alien follower, this was a giving dvd. As the episodes has developed, the episodes have slowed down its pace and it is easier to follow the cases told. Often they lead to open discussions among my friends an family wich leads to a feeling of insight to the worlds mystery - a feeling often lost in theese days of correct science. We have a lack of mystery and everything seems solved.
Ancuent Aliens Series gives everyone back the right to wonder.

I hope the team keep it coming, for I will keep buying. I love my collection of Ancient Aliens.",1398124800,,557,4.407766990291262
6161538,5,B00HF98SYO,Love this series ! It is one of the most interesting shows out there . It really makes lyou look at things in a whole new way,1397779200,,125,3.6666666666666665
6161539,4,B00HF98SYO,The video is compulsive with the content. An entirely new approach which offers new thoughts about our world and its 'relationship' with other  'worlds'. An educational programme that is thought-provoking. The set should be compulsorily acquired for the school library.,1397779200,4,269,5.725
6161540,4,B00HF98SYO,"I am disappointed in this volume of Ancient Aliens. I own the entire series and never thought I'd say this, but the packaging is very bad. There is no labeling as to which episode is on which disc and the actual discs look like they were done in someone's garage. The quality is definitely not up to the rest of the series.",1397692800,3,323,4.225806451612903
6161541,4,B00HF98SYO,It wasn't quite up to par with the other ones in the series but still very interesting.  It might be because things are overlapping and starting to combine.,1397433600,2,156,4.571428571428571
6161542,5,B00HF98SYO,This series just keeps getting better and better. Lots of interesting information give plenty of things to ponder. Keep it coming Georgio!,1397347200,,138,5.318181818181818
6161543,4,B00HF98SYO,I recommend this movie to any one who thinks outside the box.  Gives lots of food for thought.  Good watch,1397174400,,106,4.25
6161544,4,B00HF98SYO,"The Blu-Ray came in good time and plays very well. To bad the content is mostly old news, things that other season have all ready talked about. At least its better than Season 5 Vol 1 which is them going over same stuff again.",1396828800,,226,4.159090909090909
6161545,5,B00HF98SYO,Ancient Aliens Season 5 volume 2 is full of information on history and also very educating for those interested in our past.,1396656000,,124,4.681818181818182
6161546,5,B00HF98SYO,I enjoy the informative Ancient Aliens series from The History Channel. I own all of the seasons on dvd. Can't stop watching them.,1396483200,,130,4.695652173913044
6161547,5,B00HF98SYO,"If you want the truth about History, and what's really going on today, here it is. Let those who have ears hear. I recommend the entire series from start to finish.",1396310400,,164,4.32258064516129
6161548,5,B00HF98SYO,"Quick delivery.  Have to keep up the collection.  Content in the series has always approached the subject from many different points and has always been presented well.  But the series to its credit has never insisted that ""they"" exist.  Until they knock on the door we will probably never know for sure.",1395619200,,304,4.788461538461538
6161549,5,B00HF98SYO,This should be required viewing in high school or universities.  There is too much evidence that UFOs exist and aliens have been visiting us for centuries.,1395446400,,155,4.961538461538462
6161550,5,B00HF98SYO,Very nice. Quite to my expectations.,1395360000,,36,5.166666666666667
6161551,3,B00HF98SYO,"I give this a 3 star for the reason of I can not watch these blu rays on my computer. Because of the anti-piracy in them they refused to play on my pc with Corel WinDVD Pro 11. Also, It seems like it is repeating episodes example; the crystal skull episode. Will I continue to buy these series.... yes. I love the information and crazy ideas they bring forth.",1395273600,,359,4.217391304347826
6161552,5,B00HF98SYO,I LOVED WATCHING THIS ON TV. PURCHASED ALL OTHER SEASONS AND WAS HAPPY TO SEE THIS COME AVAILABLE. GREAT SHOW.,1395100800,,110,4.55
6161553,1,B00HF98SYO,"This whole series is trash pseudoscience, a cash grab rather than an actual intellectually productive exercise.  Make up some wild theory about aliens from the past...can you disprove it?  If no, then it probably did happen and we'll speak as if it's fact on a t.v. station that is supposed to be educational.  And we'll just keep making up more crap so we can crank out more seasons of this cash cow.

This is poison to young minds, and it insults many ancient cultures, assuming people from various cultures wouldn't have the brains to accomplish what they did on their own, without ""alien"" help.  And I wouldn't mind it so much if they actually had equal air time given to skeptics so they could give rational explanations for the alien theories as well, but of the numerous episodes I watched there isn't anyone giving another side of the story, completely unlike most professional documentaries.",1395100800,3,900,4.818181818181818
6161554,5,B00HF98SYO,"Quite honestly, even if you are not a proponent that ancient astronauts have visited the earth in the ancient past, the entire series of Ancient Astronauts takes the viewer to remote, unheard of locations and discussions ensue that are thought provoking and engaging.  This is the best series on History Channel!!",1394841600,14,313,5.137254901960785
6161555,2,B00HF98SYO,"I couldn't get the disks to work.  It wouldn't play any of the episodes.
Even when I cleaned the disk (twice) it wouldn't play either play all or play
any of the episodes individually.

6161556,5,B00HF98SYO,I love how fast I got the dvd and had no issues. My boyfriend loved it. I got it for him as a suprise and he sure loved it,1394409600,,122,3.2413793103448274
6161557,5,B00HF98SYO,"There are only 8 episodes on this DVD. That said, it should have sold for more like $8 instead of over $12.  There ARE subtitles for the hearing impaired.
This is a great and interesting series.  They think outside the box.  They give explanations - not necessarily THEE explanation (although some of their explanations and evidence are pretty compelling and hard to dispute) but they also ask MORE questions.  I mean really, here are ANCIENT civilizations who supposedly were not very technologically advanced and had primitive tools, but they built monuments and buildings (so exact) that we cannot duplicate them today (even with all our knowledge and technology). Some of the ancient buildings/monuments are built so precise that if we were to build them TODAY we would need (diamond) lasers to build them (but we still cannot duplicate them today). And some of the stones are so heavy, it would be next to impossible for us to move them (today).  SO HOW DID THEY DO IT??
 Very interesting series.",1394150400,,1001,4.893491124260355
