8188650,3,B000P2A5XA,This is a very expensive DVD for such a short program however the program itself was amazing and fun to watch. If you find a good deal on this DVD take it it is worth at least $10 but paying any more of it is not worth it due to the fact the show is only about 45 minutes long.,1455148800,,277,3.6333333333333333
8188651,4,B000P2A5XA,"good DVD. it is in DVD-R  My Sony DVD player plays it well.  just be sure your player is rated for DVD-R when looking to buy this DVD-R  good way to see some travel channel show.  need more shows on DVD.  video on demand can't be transfered from your HD to DVD.  DVD will need, come from the original producer/manufacturer.",1287619200,,323,4.3
