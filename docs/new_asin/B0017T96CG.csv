3175429,5,B0017T96CG,"I picked up this DVD on a whim, since I love Alton Brown and I don't get the Food Network anymore. To be honest, I wasn't really expecting to like it that much; the food-travel genre isn't all that appealing to me generally. I mean, why would you want to watch people eat? But this really blew me away, it's so so good.

Obviously, if you like Alton Brown, you know what he's like in front of the camera, and all his personality and sense of humor is here. But his creativity and the skills of the crew (all of whom get a turn on camera) really take the show beyond being a series of meals. You feel like you're on the trip with them, meeting people and learning about the food, instead of just watching someone tell you about something they're eating.

A big part of this is the diversity of the show. For example, you could do a show like this as a series of mini-presentations of restaurants all following the same format. Obviously that's not Alton's style. Some of the narration is done by voiceover, some is done in front of a map, and some is given by Alton while he's riding the bike. Sometimes the crew reviews the food while Alton films, and their opinions are regularly included. Sometimes they're at a restaurant (which could be a sit-down place, a drive through, a donut stand...), sometimes they're cooking for themselves, and they also visit caterers and the kitchen on a river barge. Sometimes the focus is on ingredients, other times on recipes. Sometimes the food is good and the people are nice, and sometimes the stop is a little disappointing. Throw in a few history lessons and factory tours, and this show never gets repetitive.

Feasting on Asphalt is a love letter to American food, whatever that is and wherever it's found. Even if you're not prone to wax poetic over hamburgers or fret about the passing of ""real America"" or whatever, I guarantee you'll enjoy tagging along on this roadtrip, and then the next time you go to your favorite local place you'll feel a little proud of ""how we do things here"". I'm already hounding my family to get it and watch it, and I'm curious to see what the companion (cook-?) book is like. Do yourself a favor and get this.",1263686400,,2186,4.4874371859296485

8267219,5,B0017T96CG,The recipes are good with Alton Brown's new asphalt seasoning for road warriors and bewilder beast back packers who originate south of the Mason-Dixon line.  If you are from the north don't try this at home.,1476662400,,207,4.75
8267220,3,B0017T96CG,"Season 2 seems to lack the slightly manic spark that made Season 1 so enjoyable. The Season 2 DVD set is much lighter on extras too. Watchable, but a disappointment.",1460246400,,165,4.533333333333333
8267221,5,B0017T96CG,"This series is the perfect confluence of Alton Brown's engaging foodie personality, motorcycling, and the open road.  It's a smooth continuation of Season 1 and that's a good thing.  Videography and style are pretty much the same.

This season has 6 episodes:
1.  A Strong Brown God
2.  Fry Me A River
3.  Soul Food Survivor
4.  Take Me To The River
5.  Mid-American Pie
6.  Lutefisk Express

Unlike Season 1, this season has no bonus episodes.

Content is terrific; however, video quality is a B.  It's 480i letterboxed widescreen, so resolution is a bit low once the frame expands to fill modern widescreen TVs.  Actual picture resolution ends up being only 720x360.  There also some noticeable black vignetting in the frame and a few pixels of junky picture content on all sides of the frame.

Ebay is a great place to find this series--especially Season 2--at reasonable used prices.",1458950400,,887,4.82
8267222,5,B0017T96CG,"I'm calling it 4.5 stars, rounding to 5.

The reason is twofold.  The first is technical...as others have mentioned, the transfer quality on these DVDs is subpar.

But the second reason is, well...  Look, I hate to criticize Brown, I really do.  In the first series I think he really captured something special.  In this series though, it's almost as though he and the crew became a little *too* self-aware and there's less of a sense of spontaneity.  Indeed, in the behind-the-scenes featurettes on the first series there is quite a bit of kvetching at how there wasn't a lot of planning to prepare the crew for what they would find.  Here it seems almost TOO planned and TOO self-conscious.

That isn't to say this isn't a good series.  It is.  Very much so.  It's clear from the series that Brown & Co had a great time doing this, and it shows.  This makes for a higher quality product.  I'm also happy that there are a couple more episodes, one of the big weaknesses of the first series (honestly, four shows totaling 180 minutes of screen time for a coast-to-coast road trip really isn't that much.....).  And, as I said in my review of the first series, this show does elegantly what a show like Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives has never been able to accomplish.

As with the first series, this series marks the ascent of Alton Brown as a *name* in the Food Network stable.  He demonstrated that he's no longer the goofy Good Eats guy, but he has serious production and presentation chops as well.  It's a good show that, in retrospect years later, helps demonstrate what we've lost vis a vis road trips.  In our era of mass produced standardized crap, it's instructive to remember that there was a time, once, when things were a lot more interesting.",1433203200,,1766,4.584664536741214
8267223,5,B0017T96CG,"Almost as good as the first season. Besides getting a little tired of Alton asking everyone for their secret receipts, good entertainment for Alton fans.",1364601600,,153,5.16
8267224,5,B0017T96CG,Food AND science? Count me in!! You not only learn about food and it's history but are entertained at the same time. Very glad I purchased this!!,1363219200,,145,4.407407407407407
8267225,5,B0017T96CG,I liked it alot.  Informative and funny.  Alton Brown is a great chef and the Feasting on Asphalt series is fantastic to own.,1328486400,,125,4.391304347826087
8267226,5,B0017T96CG,"My friend bought me this as a  set that came with the first and second season for me as a gift because she knows I love Alton and Good eats, I was worried I wouldn't like a spin off show but I LOVED it, even my boyfriend who isn't too huge into food shows looked forward to watching the next episode, It was humorous, educational, and captivating  It was Alton!

The whole premise of the show is them taking a road trip across america and not eating at any restaurant chains, he meets some great characters...eats some strange foods. The way it was shot made you feel like you were actually along for the ride.",1315008000,,610,4.28695652173913
8267227,4,B0017T96CG,"""Feasting"" is a travelogue of American food and roadside eateries that are unfortunately dying at an alarming rate. Although the concept is similar to Diners Drive-ins and Dives; this miniseries watches more like a documentary feature film. The show itself is of extremely high quality and deserves a 5 star rating. There are many stand-out moments including a comical stop at a country store where Alton try's to extract a recipe for ""the best fried chicken in the word"" from a Mr. D. The show is a humorous and entertaining from beginning to end. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned the quality of the transfer makes for poor viewing on a HDTV and so has been downgraded to 4 stars.  The picture issues are such a shame Food Network needs to do a better job with these disks. If you can overlook the picture issues the show itself it great and is well worth your purchase.",1272931200,2,878,4.664516129032258
8267228,5,B0017T96CG,"Alton Brown is great. Funny, educational, rides motorcycles and likes food! A great combination! It seems like this second season will be the last of his recorded motorcycle adventures which is too bad.
Like so many of the really good shows, seeing the show on DVD is a much better experience than with all the commercials and screen garbage they include on most TV shows now.
Not much of any 'extras' as there should have been in my opinion, just a couple of deleted scenes on each disk, the first season had a disk with all kinds of extras with it, but over all well worth buying because you'll want to watch them again!",1264377600,2,622,4.464912280701754
