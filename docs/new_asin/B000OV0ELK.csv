8186794,2,B000OV0ELK,"Dr. Chen's Tai Chi for Beginners suffers greatly from primitive production techniques.  I have three DVD players; this disc would only play on one.  The music is dull and repetitious, and the scene is totally static, so if your monitor isn't LCD it will go to black fairly often.  The teacher is good, I think, but the editing and general production are pathetic -- I speak as someone who has produced low budget videos. I suspect the one five star rating evaluation you have is an inside job, quite frankly.",1204329600,4,508,4.622222222222222
