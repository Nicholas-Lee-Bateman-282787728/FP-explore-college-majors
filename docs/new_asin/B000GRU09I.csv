2616900,5,B000GRU09I,"The Harts, Max and Freeway made this one of the best series from the past. The chemistry between Wagner and Powers exploded on the screen. A modern day version of The Thin Man series of yester year, with William Powell and Merna Loy. They solved mysteries together getting tangeled up in all the plots and trying to get untangeled. Not without the help of Max, who was a character actor from the thirties and fortys and also acted with Shirley Temple. Can not wait for the third season dvd.",1163894400,4,490,4.51685393258427
2616901,4,B000GRU09I,Why did Robert Wagner have a black eye throughout the first few episodes that not even makeup could hide?,1159747200,,105,4.578947368421052
2616902,5,B000GRU09I,"At last, the eagerly awaited second series of Hart to Hart has hit the shelves. This series contains one of the classic episodes of the show, 'What Murder' where Jonathan loses his memory, forgets that he witnessed a murder and even forgets his precious Jennifer. Fabulous stuff.

The quality of the transfers is good, not quite as clear as series one but an awful lot better than what most of us fans are used to!

The two greatest disappointments are the appalling cover image and the lack of commentaries or featurettes. The covers of the 3 individual cases inside the box are much better, one in particular is a series two shot that should have been used for the box. But hey, it's the contents that counts and you don't get much better than this!

Roll on series three and please Sony, we need a commentary on 'Hart of Darkness'!",1159488000,15,834,4.546666666666667
2616903,5,B000GRU09I,"I remember the the 70's well. This show was my absolute favorite show. I loved the chemistry between Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers. It came so naturally that they didn't have to work at it. You just knew they were having fun doing the show!! Who doesn't dream of having more money than they could ever spend, and also having the choice of whether to work or not!! Let's not forget Max, who took care of them - he sure had his hands full! He was more family than servant - and we loved him just as much. He just added to the show's charm. TV these days has become so much more serious and reality based. What fun to lose yourself in a show that was full of fun, charm, and bit of crime solving too! The show may seem dated nowadays but who cares! It's still a lot of fun to watch. My favorite episodes from this season were the one where Jonathon lost his memory and the one where he played his own uncle, Fritz Von Hart. What fun!! I can't wait to get this DVD set. Hopefully it won't be another year before Season 3 is released.",1157068800,31,1033,4.144278606965174
2616904,5,B000GRU09I,"I was just a kid when this show was on... and I loved every episode of it. Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show...

just like Charlie's Angels... or Vega$... I remember them all...

Almost 30 years later, it looks so dated... so different from today's fast paced, violent, end-twisting, loud, in-your-face TV.

STILL we love it. The stories are so simple... and Wagner and Powers had so much charm... so much style.

Let me add that today I guess I still secretly dream about having a 1978 Mercedes-Benz yellow wagon with that big telephone (laughs). It used to be so super cool!!!

Wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 year-old kid just being introduced to late 70's television - the jokes, the kitchens, the hairdos, the telephones, VCRs, big cars, disco...

Oh, and I loved Mark Snow's theme. I recognized it instantly...

And Max's introduction to Mr. and Mrs. H... whose hobby is murder!!!

Do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class' during the late 70's? Watch Hart to Hart. Everything was great. Everything was ideal!

What a great show!

Thanks for the memory.

PS... someday, someone will write a History of american society through the 20th century's TV shows' point of view. I'm sure Hart to Hart, Charlie's Angels, Moonlighting, Magnum PI (and many many others)will all have a lot to say.

A classic!!!!!",1153785600,72,1400,4.716049382716049
2616905,5,B000GRU09I,"For five wonderful seasons, ""Hart to Hart"" was about the most fun you could have in an hour without getting into any trouble. Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers were simply perfect as the rich couple with nothing to do but solve murders. They were Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, living the fun life we all wished we had. The chemistry between Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner was natural and you could always tell, especially with Wagner, that they were having a ball.

Sidney Sheldon created the characters but it was really a stroke of genius to cast Wagner and Powers. Wagner took his cool Alexander Munday persona from ""It Takes a Thief"" and just made him richer and happier, with a lovely companion he got to keep. Stefanie Powers always had a certain something but had never really found the right part, until Hart to Hart. Jennifer Hart came so naturally that you couldn't help thinking she wasn't really acting at all. Come to think of it, the same could be said of Robert Wagner's seemingly effortless turn as Jonathan Hart.

This was heaven for light mystery fans. There was always plenty of fun banter between Jonathan and ""Mrs. H"" and enough humorous situations mixed in with the latest week's adventure to keep everyone tickled pink. Not to be undervalued as the reason the show was such a big hit, was Lionel Stander's role as their butler, Max. Max was much more like family than hired help, and in the show's opening every week, you knew right away Max was an important part of the proceedings. After introducing the self-made millionaire, Jonathan, and his other boss, Mrs. H, Max always stated that he had trouble taking care of them, because their hobby was murder!

Not to be forgotten, of course, was their lovable dog, Freeway, who sometimes forgot who was the owner and who was the pet. The stories were frivilous fun, as this wasn't real danger, just TV danger, and we always new our favorite husband and wife would solve the mystery and uncork some champagne at the end.

Fans of the show were delighted when the first season of this fun show finally got a DVD release and are once again made happy by the release of season two. A lot happened in the second season as the show just kept getting better. Jonathan had amnesia after an accident and forgot a murder in one episode. In another, Jennifer was kidnapped. Max's ex-wife showed up and caused tons of trouble. And Jennifer was stalked by a mummy when a not so ancient body was found in an Egyptian sarcophagus! ""Hart to Hart"" was delightful escapist fare. Mark Snow's ""Hart to Hart"" theme at the opening of the show was light and breezy, and fans looked forward to hearing it every week. Snow would finally become famous for his moody theme for ""The X-Files.""

The episodes for season two are as follows: Murder, Murder On The Wall, What Murder?, This Lady is Murder, Murder is Man's Best Friend, 'Tis the Season To Be Murdered, Murder Wrap, Murder In Paradise, Ex-Wives Can Be Murder, Murder is a Drag, Hart-Shaped Murder, Slow Boat to Murder, Murder in the Saddle, Homemade Murder, Solid Gold Murder, Getting Aweigh with Murder, The Murder of Jonathan Hart, The Latest In High Fashion Murder, Operation Murder, Murder Takes A Bow, Blue Chip Murder

The domestic and mystery adventures of the self-made man, Jonathan, and his ex-journalist wife, Jennifer, made for a charming and breezy hour of pleasure. The adventures of the spohisticated couple, who it turned out were just like us, only rich, was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day, and still is. Every TV mystery fan will want to pick this one up. So pop the cork from the champagne in the limo, call ahead to make sure the private jet is waiting, and jot off to TV land, where rich and attractive couples delight us by solving murders while living the life of leisure for a second season. Great fun!",1153180800,97,3846,4.640234948604992

2616935,2,B000GRU09I,"Only a few good eps in this season.  For Stefanie fans, (only reason I got this) It is a big dissapointment.  Every thing seems to be shot ""above cleavage line"".  Even when she wears a swim suit for half a second, there are no clear shots.  No sexy outfits like the first season.
So basically if you are getting this for Stefanie eye candy, then forget it and get the first season which was much much better.  I suspect Stefanie's body got in the way of Wagner's ego who hamms it up this season with disguises and costumes.",1480464000,,523,4.295918367346939

2617239,5,B000GRU09I,"""Hart to Hart"" glitters off of the screen and into your heart.  You'll feel like you've been travelling in high style and on your trip... you fall in love.  The romance of the Harts is captivating.  The mysteries are campy, amusing & on occasion heart-pounding.  As they start up their Bentley, come along for a ride of intrigue or jump into their jet for a flight of fancy.  Either way, chasing criminals has never been so elegant.

If possible, season two (1980/81) is bigger & better.  Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) is even more beautiful and so are her clothes (thank you designer Nolan Miller).  Jonathan (Robert Wagner) has that devil-may-care twinkle in his eyes times two.  And the double entendres and banter are funny and saucy.  Jonathan to Jennifer as she rescues him from a gun-wielding gold thief:  ""Darling, did I ever compliment you on your perfect timing?""  Jennifer:  ""Yes, but not in public.""

Great scenery abounds as they travel to Manhattan, Hawaii, Colorado & a Bahamian cruise.  They also celebrate with Christmas & Valentine's episodes.  Some standouts:  ""'Tis the Season to be Murdered,"" ""Murder in the Saddle"" and ""What Murder?"" where Wagner shows great acting skills as Jonathan gets amnesia, and we get some backstory on the characters.  Chase scenes ruled season one, and there are still some of those, but costumes rule season two.  Watch for:  Santa, an elf, Rhett, Scarlett, Stefanie playing Jennifer's lookalike and an image of Max in drag that I'll never get out of my head.

Too cute for costumes, Freeway, their dog, is a scene-stealer.  I laughed out loud when a man drops dead on a cruise, and Freeway irreverently stands his front paws on him. Other funny scenes include a black-tie affair in a grungy gym for a bodybuilding pose-off, complete with ""Macho Man"" blaring in the background.  The campy moments only add to the fun of a show that often is tongue-in-cheek.

For more fun, watch for these guest spots:  Jerry Stiller, Shari Belafonte, Anthony Newley, John Gavin, Amy Madigan, Jane Withers and others.

I highly recommend season two; I also highly recommend they release seasons 3-5.  It's a pleasure to bask in the Harts' glow.  At the end of each show, Jonathan & Jennifer will leave you with a quip, a kiss or a romantic moment...and you will be left with a smile.",1332028800,4,2313,4.831632653061225
2617240,5,B000GRU09I,"Season two of Hart to Hart is just as fun as the first. Stephanie Powers and Robert Wagner are the perfect couple to solve 20 stories of of mayhem and murder, rich, beautiful and very sexy....in a very romantic way.  If you are looking for a charming way to spend the evening these shows fill the bill perfectly. Now Sony bring us the next 3 seasons too!",1330128000,2,354,4.2835820895522385
2617241,5,B000GRU09I,"I am a mystery buff. When I watched their show on TV,I just loved the relationship between Stephine Powers and Robert Wagner on the show. I was happy to purchase the show. I have order this DVD and was pleased with the timely fashion on receiving it. I would buy from this seller again",1327363200,,285,4.296296296296297
2617242,5,B000GRU09I,I always loved this series.  The Harts were so fun to watch because they were so in love and they had exciting adventures solving crimes even though they weren't cops but happened to be wealthy jet setters.  Thoroughly fun to watch. Can't wait to get the rest of the series.,1326844800,,274,4.46
2617243,5,B000GRU09I,My wife and I always remember this series as being great.  We hadn't seen it since it was originally produced.  I ordered the two seasons and we are loving watching it.  It shows actual romance between the two leads as well as interesting mysteries.  Not like today where you see a mystery and someones either a serial killer or a rapist etc.  This series was done with class and has class.,1317513600,2,390,4.436619718309859
2617244,4,B000GRU09I,"Like another reviewer, I think the cover picture for Hart to Hart, Season 2 looks a little awkward. The cover for the first two discs would have been a much wiser choice as cover art. That really doesn't change anything though- it's still a fantastic show! Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers are beautiful and talented actors and Lionel Stander has got to be the funniest character ever to walk across a tv screen!

There are some fantastic episodes in Season 2: The Murder of Johnathan Hart (where Johnathan has to fake his own death), Operation Murder (where Jennifer witnesses a murder while in the hospital but no one believes her), and Murder Wrap (where Jennifer's appearance, resembling an ancient Egyptian princess, may cost her her life)!

This series is a must-have for any Hart to Hart fan. Unfortunately, Sony has no plans to release seasons 3-5. Nevertheless, you will never regret buying this series. If you're already a fan, you need to check out Moonlighting with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd and Remington Steele with Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan (in my own opinion, these two series are ranked even higher than Hart to Hart which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5!)
I hope this helped!",1315612800,2,1232,4.806603773584905
2617245,5,B000GRU09I,"Just started to watch this series.
Most notable is the absence of gratuitous violence - this is replaced by 'fun'.
So far scripts are typical Sidney Sheldon of those times. Not strong on plot by today's standards and lots of 'fun' spotting the bloopers. In the first episode the multimillionaire hero high kicks a door with the sole of his shoe in middle of shot - the shoe has a hole worn in it with what appears to be the sock visible through it.
Reviews constantly mention the chemistry between Wagner and Powers - it is definitely a rare and excellently crafted element.
There is no steamy skin shots and the intimacy is quite benign but you can not help wondering how their real life partners managed to deal with the so obvious 'sparks' flashing out of the screen.
Max offsets the Wagner and Powers glamour and beauty with a crusty dry persona which balances what might have otherwise become overpowering.
It is 'fun'being able to pay attention to the characters the settings and the scripting without being distracted by the plot - which is often obvious very quickly.
It is 'fun' predicting the next action sequence just before it comes on screen - and being right more often that not.
It is 'fun' watching this series with others and typically generates lots of high-fives as the action is called correctly.
It is 'fun' watching because of the lack of rigid attention to detail required in today's highly polished shows - watch Wagner's hair.
The actors and the script do not take themselves too seriously and this makes it just fun to watch.
If you do not take it seriously this series is a great investment.",1312848000,2,1618,4.660839160839161

2617248,1,B000GRU09I,"Great show, but as is the case with many Sony releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Fantasy Island, Hart To Hart, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Sony in the first place.

I love mysteries and what I love more is the concept of two people who love each other, do not have affairs, have money and love to solve mysteries! What could be better.  The relationship between them and Max (who is more like a father figure) and of, course, Freeway, makes you feel that life can offer you the best of everything.  The TV shows of today, especially the reality shows, must be the concept of someone who has the mind if a two year old. They are absolutely the pits.  That is why most of us who love mysteries are just soaking up the DVD's of yesteryear (Simon & Simon, Charlie Chan, Murder She Wrote, Michael Shayne movies, etc.) I think it is a sad commentary on our society that shows that were made over 25 years ago are better than the shows of today, especially with all the special effects technology that has come into being. We do not want to see chainsaw massacres and blood. We want to see mysteries and enjoy our detectives solving them.  In any event, I hope that Season Three comes out very soon.

8134237,5,B000GRU09I,"""Hart to Hart"" was such a stellar, adventurous and unique action, adventure and crime television series.

Jonathan Hart (Robert Wagner) is the CEO of Hart Industries, a Los Angeles-based global conglomerate.
His wife Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) is a freelance journalist.
Living the jetset lifestyle, the Harts often find themselves involved in cases of smuggling, theft,
corporate and international espionage and, most commonly, murder.
At their opulent Bel Air estate, they are assisted by Max (Lionel Stander),
their loyal, gravel-voiced butler, cook and chauffeur who also helps with their cases.
The Harts' beloved pet dog is a Lowchen called Freeway,
so named because he was a stray that they found wandering on the freeway.

Robert Wagner was perfect in the role of the self-made millionaire and amateur detective Jonathan Hart.
Stefanie Powers was perfect in the role of the freelance journalist and amateur detective Jennifer Hart.
Lionel Stander was perfect in the role of the Harts' butler, cook and chauffeur Max.

The second season of ""Hart to Hart"" originally aired on ABC from November 11, 1980 until May 26, 1981.
