If you wanna know about The Bermuda Triangle than get this video, you won't be disappointed. It tells about the disappearance of flight 19, one of the most baffling Bermuda Triangle mysteries and much more. I won't spoil it for you! See it for yourself!",1424649600,2,352,4.693548387096774
8169762,4,B000MLDNVU,"I have watched this VHS many years ago...I was captivated and intrigued...I was young and naive. I re-watched it a while ago and looking back and after watchin and reading other related articles,some of the stories were apparently unverified by Berlitz. The video is  about Bermuda's mysteries , ships,planes,people going missing ,UFO's and Philadelphia Experiment...Take it with a pinch of salt and you'll enjoy it. Too bad there's no remastered copy of it on DVD or I would buy it. Don't believe everything that you hear or even see.",1298851200,,535,5.01123595505618
