4234220,5,B003ZJK4HW,"A Christmas Snow is a faith oriented, family friendly movie about forgiveness and reconciliation...(and Christmas of course!)... it includes not only heart-warming Christmas scenerios, but also a few unexpected twists. The cast is wonderful. Muse Watson, once again, was a stellar performer. He draws you right into the movie, as if you were in the room with them! Have to say, that it is also heart or gut-wrenching,..you may want to bring some tissues then... if you have any similar experiences as this story outlines... or know anyone that does... but by bringing sharply into the equation, the opportunities that can arise from the Godly choices we can make, such as choosing to forgive... the movie shows how lives can change through forgiveness and reconciliation. Children who watch this film will love Cameron Ten Napel's part throughout the story!",1285891200,2,857,5.172661870503597

4234222,5,B003ZJK4HW,This movie is great. Every family should watch this movie. The story line is very good. The message that it tells is one that everyone can relate to and the acting is good. don't walk but run to get this movie,1285891200,,209,4.121951219512195
4234223,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I watched A Christmas Snow on the last day of September and the weather where I live (Southern Turkey) was still in the 70's, but by the end of the movie, I was certianly in the Christmas Spirit! A Christmas Snow is a heartwarming story of healing and forgiveness at a time of year that for so many people equals heartache, bitterness, loneliness unmet expectations, and angry fighting with family.

In A Christmas Snow, we see a group of really good actors (especially by Christian movie standards) living out a difficult Christmas and coming out on the other side with changed hearts and changed lives.  It is a beautiful film and I believe it will be a new Christmas Tradition.

4234277,1,B003ZJK4HW,"I did not care for this movie at all. My biggest complaint; the young girl portrayed in this movie was a complete and utter brat. Her behavior showed no respect for her father or his new girlfriend. Everything was all about her and she ruled the roost. I had to laugh a time or two when the adults seemed to think it was necessary to ask the daughter's permission to do something. It completely disgusted me and I was embarrassed for parents everywhere who allow a child to act and react in this manner. There is no excuse for rudeness and disrespect and there is no excuse good enough for a parent to allow this behavior. It is even worse when the adults make excuses for said behavior instead of dealing with it straight on. This movie talked about and showed a Bible multiple times but there was nothing biblical in the parenting (by the father and at times the girlfriend) except for the older man. He demanded the girl behave correctly and with manners and she instantly felt close to him. She knew her boundaries with him and did not push them. I am glad I watched it alone as I would not want my children to be influenced by the negative behavior or in any way think it was acceptable, even though they know it is not. Not a good example at all.",1423440000,3,1252,4.3319148936170215

Except for ""The Nativity"", this is the best modern family Christmas movie I've ever seen...light, somewhat humorous but not silly or trite, good acting, believable interaction among characters.  My mom fell asleep before she had seen 1/2 of it, and I told her we HAD to see it again the next night.  We agree it is a wonderful, quality movie.  We also watched ""Midnight Clear"", which was rated higher than ""A Christmas Snow"", and we MUCH preferred the latter.

I don't know what's up here, but beware of those reviews--this film is close to unwatchable on many different levels, including characters who are completely flat, a script that feels forced and contrived, and acting that's really only fair at best.  If it hadn't been free on Prime, we wouldn't have watched it at all, but even at that, we couldn't make it all the way through.

However, even within this genre I found this film to be very badly acted, illogical, and populated  with unlikeable, unappealing characters. The child was particularly off-putting.  Rude, snide children are not cute.  Even if one tries to explain them as missing absent mothers.

4234424,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I stumbled upon this by accident one night on TBN thinking it would be another ho-hum modern Christmas movie. But I was cleaning my bedroom so I just kept the channel on for background noise. After 30 minutes into the movie, I thought hey, this is kind of good. Then as the movie progressed I fell in love with the characters and the Christmas story. there is something so cozy about all the snow and Kathleen's house with the fireplace and candles lit. Just magical, I want to go there. But the story is such a tearjerker, I was balling at the end. This is what Christmas is all about- family, and the birth of our Savior. It goes to show how we get so caught up in life's silly things. This is definitely one of my new favorites, which is rare to say about a new modern day movie. This is right up there with the classics, so heartwarming. I honestly don't know how anyone could have rated this bad. I wish I could purchase it from Amazon- please make more copies available.",1418083200,,976,4.309782608695652

4234428,4,B003ZJK4HW,"I'm glad I stuck out this movie.  The story starts so slowly, even hard to believe for a bit.  Who leaves their kid overnight with someone they are dating when those two have never met?  But once the story got involved it got much better.  And the ending redeemed it completely.  Could have been better made so that it flowed better and made a little more sense, but the point is sweet and poignant.  The reason we all tear up is because somewhere in each of us is a rough spot we haven't been able to let go.  This movie shows the extreme of how it can affect us and our relationships, but with a little love and a little forgiveness, we can turn our world around.  Its a little corny but still a sweet story.",1417824000,,710,4.169117647058823

Films in general seem to have fallen very far from those early days, but so has culture, I suppose.  This film keeps it clean and has a nice, if predictable, plot.  I hear lots of people complain about predictability, but it doesn't bother me.  It's still a great feel-good film.

It really teaches the true meaning of Christmas, in so many ways.  It brought tears to my eyes, as I watched it.  And the ending, I won't divulge here, so all can find out, was such a miracle.

4234607,2,B003ZJK4HW,This movie felt like a tv holiday special that becomes a movie with a religious message . Not what I was looking for.,1388534400,,117,4.130434782608695
4234608,4,B003ZJK4HW,"Once you get past how offputting the two female leads are initially - and if you press on, you will start warming up to them - A Christmas Snow becomes an absorbing, must-see teleplay. But, yeah, for the film's opening minutes (and then for a few more minutes after) I was disenchanted with Kathleen and with Lucy. But, okay, let me set the table.

It's not as if they broke the mold when they made Kathleen Mitchell (Catherine Mary Stewart). Her personal traits and tendencies are those exhibited by empty-living women so often featured in holiday movies. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Kathleen Mitchell runs a gourmet restaurant, and maybe the local paper wasn't fibbing when it referred to her as a ""gourmet grinch."" Kathleen has commanded her staff to work thru the holidays. Her reason (and I don't know that I buy it): ""I will not abandon my loyal holiday loners."" I actually grinned when she said that. Sue me, it was a good line.

Enter Kathleen's current beau Andrew Wright (Anthony Tyler Quinn) and his pouty 10-year-old daughter Lucy (Cameron Ten Napel). You don't need a PhD in Duh! ology to suss out that Lucy feels threatened by Kathleen's presence. She's still in that place where she feels no woman can replace her mom. So here's Lucy, prodding and testing Kathleen, being the champion brat.

Mere days before Christmas, Tulsa is rocked by a freak winter storm, just in time to strand Kathleen and Lucy and a wise, grizzled samaritan named Sam on the corner of Royal Dublin Lane, where Kathleen lives. See, about Lucy, her dad had to be away for business and had asked Kathleen to mind Lucy. See, about Sam (Muse Watson), well, the story behind Sam's staying at Kathleen's may be too convoluted to tell. Suffice to say, he extricated her from parking lot peril and she felt indebted enough to drive him to the bus station only to find the bus station shut down for the night. Gauging the plummeting temperature, Kathleen invites Sam to stay over for the night. Huh, lookit that. Guess it's not so convoluted after all.

2010's A Christmas Snow peels back its story and gradually steeps you in a series of captivating moments. There's stuff to pick up on, themes of faith and forgiveness and letting someone into your hurting heart. These three wonderful actors - Stewart, Ten Napel, and Watson - interact beautifully. I'm starting to get miffed, actually, 'cause I get this sense that they just pulled one over on me. I think there was a sermon or a lesson in there somewhere, but executed with such warmth and with such touching simplisticly that I lapped it up. And what Christmas movie is worth its salt that doesn't give you a good cry or a good gasp? And how awesome is Muse Watson? (Answer: very awesome.)",1388448000,,2717,4.677824267782427

4234611,4,B003ZJK4HW,"Kathleen, an uptight perfectionist running her own restaurant, is being courted by Andrew who has to leave town suddenly on business and asks Kathleen to watch his 10 year old daughter Lucy overnight. Lucy's mother died a few years earlier, and Lucy is suspicious of any other woman who might try to take her place. She is also rather rude to Kathleen, and it doesn't help that Kathleen has no ""way with children"". Kathleen leaves Lucy at home briefly to go out and run an errand. After almost running down an elderly pedestrian who later protected her during a parking lot scuffle with teenagers, ends up bringing him home for the night because the bus station is closed and he has no place to go. She invites Sam into her home with the intention of taking him back to the bus station in the morning.

Overnight, an ice storm shuts down transportation and power and makes them housebound. Thus begins an alliance between Kathleen, Lucy and Sam. Since they are stuck in the house for a couple of days, they play games, cook pancakes, work on Lucy's costume for the school play, act out the Christmas pageant, tell stories and bond together as an unlikely family. Through these acts and their conversations, their individual stories are revealed - each of them scarred in someway and looking for a way out of their pain.

It's a sweet story with a happy ending, one that young families can watch over and over. I don't think it is destined to become a Christmas classic, but surely has messages of hope and forgiveness and faith that many will find welcome.",1388448000,,1556,4.634057971014493

Many may be able to relate to the characters in the movie in how easy it is to live life without God in it. By choosing to live without God in their life it displays the true pain and struggles an individual goes through.  The ending is great because the main character expects God back into her life and forgives the people that have hurt her in her life. However, she was unable to do that until she expected Christ first.",1386720000,2,528,4.28

In order for me to enjoy a movie I need to bond with a character and honestly I didn't like the main character or the little girl's character at all. It was only when ""the stranger"" appeared that the movie began to be enjoyable. I got the fact the woman had ""issues"" because her father left her at Christmas though that part was a little subtle at first and I got the part about the hateful little girl missing her Mom at Christmas and I got the part that they both had similar issues due to their abandonment feelings but there just wasn't enough warmth from them to feel sorry for them. The two characters were awful together and painful to watch. But seriously the huge snowfall that trapped them in the house wasn't that believable unless of course you live in Southern California. If you live in Colorado not so much. We almost shut it off several times but decided to continue watching it until the end and the ending was the best part.

4234713,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I saw part of this one Christmas and found the story so touching and well made that I had to buy it. I was very surprised by the ending and thought it a wonderful story.

The story revolves around three characters: Kathleen (played by Catherine Mary Stewart) who is a dedicated career woman who shuns Christmas and any celebration of it as a result of her childhood abandonment by her father. She ends up having to ""babysit"" the daughter of her fiance (played by Cameron ten Napel) who has her own heartbreak to deal with - the death of her mother years ago that still haunts her. The third character is the stranger named Sam (played by Muse Watson) who defends Kathleen from muggers in a parking lot only to get hurt for his trouble and reach the bus station too late to catch his bus. Feeling beholden to Sam, Kathleen allows him to stay at her place for the night.

Fate then plays a hand as a blizzard hits, making roads impassable as well as cutting the electric power! These three people are then forced to confront their pasts. Though the film deals with sadness and heartbreak, the characters find joy, humor and the freedom that comes with forgiveness. There is also redemption for one character.

Catherine Stewart gives an acceptable performance, but the real stars here are Cameron ten Napel  and Muse Watson who steal the show! This is a wonderful story that is well made and, generally, well acted.

I hope you enjoy the story as I did and are as surprised as I was by the conclusion of the story. This is a five star movie and I do recommend it.",1385769600,3,1561,4.463157894736842

4234753,4,B003ZJK4HW,"This is a great holiday movie for the entire family. It has a traditional Biblical Christmas theme.  Very seldom do you hear parts of scripture read aloud in a movie but in this movie, about two thirds of the way through, the story of Jesus being brought to the temple for dedication and circumcision is read aloud verbatim. The point of the scripture is to remind us of Simeon, who was promised life until he saw the Savior Jesus.
A workaholic woman, owner of a successful restaurant, is given a bad review in the local newspaper calling her a Grinch. Enter the boyfriend with a young daughter. The wife/mother has died and dad is getting on with life but the daughter isn't. The dad/boyfriend has a business trip, The babysitter fails to show up and the girlfriend/successful restaurateur has her life turned upside down and scrambling to accommodate a grumpy 10 year old girl.
A late night trip to the store for costume making supplies brings the workaholic woman in contact with an elderly gentleman.  A sudden snowstorm keeps them in the house, without electricity, no cellphones and unable to drive  for about 36 hours. And the story progresses from there. Lessons are learned. Old hurts and hew hurts are addressed and forgiveness is experienced.
From a writer's point of view this is an old theme, but it is a very realistic one. Life really does revolve around a few common themes. Dialogue moves the story along and it isn't too pedantic or trite. The fact that this tale uses the part of the Christmas story involving Jesus's trip to the temple 8 days after birth adds a very nice twist and underlying message to the entire story line.
It's worth seeing and worth thinking about once the viewing is done. Merry Christmas!",1355011200,6,1732,4.70957095709571

4234760,5,B003ZJK4HW,"A Christmas Snow is a heartwarming movie about three people who have a special encounter on Christmas. A Christmas Snow is one of the better-directed and acted Christian movies and presents the Gospel in a winsome, compelling way.
For Kathleen, Christmas has always been an unwelcome reminder of her father's abandonment almost three tumultuous decades ago. Although she has tried to forget her past, it has not forgotten her, and in the days leading up to Christmas an unforgiving blizzard traps her in her home with two unlikely roommates who will bring her face-to-face with the hurts of her past. Will she be able to let go and grab hold of a life-changing forgiveness or will she continue to be haunted by the pain of the past as the storm of a century brings the chance of a lifetime?
When watching A Christmas Snow, the characters seemed to come to life. After viewing the information that was listed by the producers I wasn't too sure on what the movie was trying to covey. A Christmas Snow was written by Jim Stovall who also wrote ""The Ultimate Gift,"" which was a best seller which pulled me in to this new novel. I  loved the book that inspired this movie, and I think the film was successful in delivering its message.
I also found that the price was great and got to my house quickly. I would recommend this film to families who are having a tough time interacting or just want to experience something that is indeed family friendly.",1327622400,2,1446,4.604651162790698

This film is the first true Christmas classic produced in many years.  The author of the book (Jim Stovall) always writes stories that draw you in and make you think BUT in a family friendly way.  The book was brought to life in this film.  I had never heard of the cast members but they were well picked and did their jobs well. I identified with the characters personally as they related back to so many of my life's ups and downs. OK, I'll admit that I teared up a few times as the story sank in and touched my heart.

I loved that there was significant scripture read and referenced and that the movie was promoting forgiveness and reconciliation.  But I really didn't grow attached to the characters, except for Sam, the older gentleman.  Kathleen's character was mean and grumpy from the beginning, so it was hard to like her and empathize with her - the script really lacked alot of depth that would've helped us understand her character better.  The little girl was very obnoxious and rude, and her dad didn't do much to stop her, which annoyed me (granted her mother had died and she was angry about dad's girlfriend, but again this could have been written better so that we wouldn't automatically dislike her!).

The other thing that really annoyed me - that I did NOT expect - was that there was an element of paranormal to the movie that you didn't really see coming.  I was seriously bothered that a movie that seemed to have a true Christian message would turn out the way it did.

This movie would rank in our top picks and I'm sure we will watch it many times. It is a very engaging story and the actors (and actresses) do a fine job of drawing the viewer into the story. We became fans of Trost Moving Pictures after the release of the action film ""Find Me"" it was a good movie, but had some weak areas in the story and acting- I have to say this film displays an incredible amount of improvement on many areas of film making, acting and storytelling. It was as good as any high budget ""Hallmark"" movie that we have seen. I was very impressed with the high quality that TMP has attained in just a few short films.

A good line may be thought of once in a while, but a whole film that effects the heart will be remembered forever. I laughed throughout and at the tender end, my heart filled with happy tears for the outcome.

As far as the directiong, the begining started slow, but the directing got better as the film went along. I understand that this is the 2nd movie Tracy Trost has directed. I look for experience to be on his side, because the begining compared to the end, dramatically improved. This is an exciting time for Tracy Trost and I look forward to seeing his next film.

4234787,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I was not sure what to expect from this movie, but the trailer I saw online caught my interest.  What I found was a movie with a deep lesson in forgiveness that went from profound to humorous by turns.

Through a set of circumstances, three hurting people find themselves together waiting out a snow and ice storm without electricity and with only one cell phone that is running out of battery life.  Each ends up coming face to face with the demons from their past that they are challenged to work through.  In the process they go from very serious moments to very humorous ones by turns, creating surprising moments for the audience.

I found the story to have great character development, and the acting was fabulous.  I thought that the main point of the movie, the importance of family and of forgiveness, was brought home very well.  Now that I know the ending, I look forward to watching this movie again, to pick out more lessons and notice more humorous touches that I found really added to the movie from an entertainment perspective.

I highly recommend this movie.",1288396800,5,1076,4.656084656084656

What a shame it will miss these most-deserved honors.

  The plot centers around Kathleen (Catherine Mary Stewart), an embittered woman whose only focus is on running her restaurant. The story takes place at Christmas time, and Kathleen, whose father abandoned her family on Christmas Eve when she was a child, wants nothing to do with Christmas! Her boyfriend, Andrew (Anthony Tyler Quinn), has to go on a business trip and talks Kathleen into watching his daughter Lucy (Cameron Ten Napal). Neither Kathleen nor Lucy are happy with this situation. The major player in this film, the mysterious Sam (Muse Watson), stumbles on the scene when Kathleen almost runs him down late one night when she is on her way home from the restaurant. Kathleen ends up taking him home, and as they say . . .""the plot thickens"" as a major snowstorm hits the town, the electricity goes out, and these 3 characters are forced to get to know each other on a whole new level.

  As an aside, fans of the popular TV show, ""The Biggest Loser,"" will enjoy seeing last year's winner, Danny Cahill, play a journalist who visits Kathleen's restaurant to review it for his newspaper column.  In addition, fans of the award-winning, #1 drama NCIS will welcome Muse Watson's performance as the shadowy, captivating Sam. Watson plays ""Mike Franks"" in NCIS, and he takes on a whole new persona in ""A Christmas Snow"" that will soften and stir even the most hardened heart.

4234790,5,B003ZJK4HW,"A Christmas Snow is about a woman, Kathleen Mitchell, who was wounded by her father walking out on Christmas when she was a young girl. She blames her mother for him leaving and won't speak to her. The feelings of abandonment have followed her all her life and she refuses to celebrate Christmas. She lives by a strict routine and gets comfort in it. However this Christmas is different. Things happen that she has no control over and she is stuck with two house guests that she did not figure on. The first one is the 10 year old daughter of her boyfriend, whose babysitter backed out at the last minute. The second is a strange man, Sam, whom she rescued after almost running him down. Trapped in a snow storm for several days before Christmas these two people help her to see life in a different way. She learns about forgiveness and the true meaning of letting go.

The great thing about this movie is through the acting of Catherine Mary Stewart, Muse Watson, and Cameron Ten Nopel we see how pain and bitterness can ruin our lives and how forgiveness and understanding and love can change everything. It is a wonderful, heartwarming movie. I will watch it every Christmas and probably throughout the year just as a reminder of everything that is a true blessing.",1288310400,8,1268,4.58590308370044
4234791,5,B003ZJK4HW,"The holidays, especially Christmas, are difficult for many people.  Although the reasons are varied, the pain is still the same.  Unlike most other 'feel good' Christmas movies, this one offers up the 'true' reason for Christmas, and the source of hope that we all seek after.  Kathleen's father walks out on Christmas eve without a word, devastating his young daughter.  Skip forward 30 years and she is now a successful restaurant owner with no Christmas spirit.  Unwillingly she has to babysit her boyfriend's daughter (a spunky 10-year old) just before Christmas, and in comes a massive snowstorm, trapping Kathleen, her boyfriend's daughter, and a stranger Kathleen brought home (because she almost ran over him) in the house.  As Christmas draws closer, the story unfolds revealing each character's heart, and their desires for the holidays and the future.  This is destined to become a Christmas classic.

4234793,4,B003ZJK4HW,"Last summer I had the privilege of attending the Gideon Film Festival in North Carolina. The primary reason I attended was to see Muse Watson, the actor who plays Mike Franks on ""NCIS"". However, it turned out to be more than I bargained for. I found myself on the outside looking in on a group of people who were working to fulfill their dreams of making Christian films and telling stories from a Christian perspective. One of those stories was ""A Christmas Snow.""

""A Christmas Snow"" is the story of a grinch-like woman whose father had left one Christmas Eve and spoiled every subsequent Christmas for her, until one snowy Christmas. This year, a blizzard and a houseful of unexpected guests give her a new appreciation for the holiday.

When I saw them movie at the festival, I was charmed by its simple, yet moving story. As time passed, I thought I was just pulled in by the thrill of the festival and of meeting Muse. I had a opportunity to see the movie again recently and was still moved. This is a fine story that puts one in the Christmas spirit, even in October. It has with that substance called Christmas Magic that sits just right with the viewer and reminds one that at Christmas anything is possible.

I do want in my life, my family, and in the lives of our friends to see values like love, life, friendship, hope, faith, peace, family, and forgiveness.  Isn't that what life is all about?

The film uses the unusual circumstances trapping three relative strangers to show just how much the three have in common.  The themes of faith, friendship, peace, family and forgiveness are all covered in this film, which makes it relatable to the viewer.  It is a family-friendly movie with no questionable scenes that parents would need to worry about and should appeal to the young as well as the old.  I really look forward to sharing this movie with other friends and family.

4234804,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I grew up in a time where Christmas classics meant (and still means) Rankin-Bass, Charles Schultz and Dr. Seuss. These classics usually focus on Santa Claus and gifts. Until now, I could only name a few that focus on Jesus (The Little Drummer Boy, The Small One).

A Christmas Snow is a story is about the three people and what they learn about life, and forgiveness, during the week of Christmas. It focuses on the Bible rather than the shopping.

Kathleen is a restaurant owner who had a heartbreaking experience during Christmas while she was ten years old. Her father left the family and never returned. Her Mom remarried, but Kathleen rejected the new husband because she wanted her father back instead. As she grew older and eventually moved out, Kathleen separated herself from her Mom. This left Kathleen preferring to ignore Christmas (for example, leaving her restaurant open on Christmas), and indulging in comfort food when she is stressed (usually chocolate, and occasionally other peoples dinners).

Lucy is a ten year old who has had her Mom pass away (my guess is at the age of eight). She has become the woman of her own house, has no trouble speaking her mind, but does have trouble with her manners. She has been seeing a therapist and can be the therapist herself. Her father has been dating Kathleen for some time, and she can notice things are starting to get serious. She does not like Kathleen; as Lucy explains to her Dad ""she is not Mom"".

Sam is an elderly man who left his family in the past. He saw himself becoming messed up like his own father did; with anger, drinking, other women. He gave up seeing things as too late to change. After this, he found God and has made it his goal to see his daughter for Christmas. His favorite passage is Luke 2: 29-32.

The supporting cast of Andrew (Lucy's father), Kathleen's Mom and step-Dad, the journalist and the entire cast at the restaurant does an excellent performance no matter how large or how small. The filming does a great job of attention to detail in the background. For example, the weather report that you may not even be watching because it is in the background, shows heavy snow and heavy ice in the forecast for the Tulsa area. The only part I wish was re-filmed was at the supermarket (age and acting of cast, the closing of the store, and the parking lot lighting).

The DVD itself offers previews of five songs from the soundtrack; cast interviews and a directors diary. One of the audio options is narration for the blind, which describes what is going on in the movie along with the movie audio track. The trailer for Trost Motion Pictures ""Find Me"" is there (this is the movie Lucy is watching while Kathleen visits the store). Oddly, no subtitles exist; and the trailer for A Christmas Snow is not on the DVD.

In conclusion, I find this to be the perfect film to put on during the last few days before Christmas; after all the shopping is done, all the lights are on, and when it is time to finally relax before the Holidays. This movie will be released on October 8th. The soundtrack and paperback by Jim Stovall is already available.",1286064000,7,3133,4.59391771019678

4234807,5,B003ZJK4HW,"We had the opportunity to review this excellent film for our magazine Point North Tidings and we have been urged, as long time Amazon. Com buyers to reprint it here.

  This October, lovers of family-friendly films will have a real treat with the release of A Christmas Snow on DVD.  Having interviewed Tracy Trost, the director, and Catherine Mary  Stewart, who has the female lead, we anticipated a real treat when we were permitted to preview the film.  Nor were we disappointed  as we found this to be one of the most outstanding Christmas  films that has come out in years.

  The plot is centered  around Kathleen (Catherine Mary Stewart), a hard business woman who has been greatly hurt by the past.  Right before Christmas her boyfriend Andrew (Anthony Tyler Quinn) asks her to look after his daughter Lucy (Cameron Ten Napal) while he is away on a business trip.  The fireworks between the daughter and possible future mother make a story in itself.  Then the enigmatic  Sam comes on the scene, as delightfully played by Muse Watson.  This mysterious figure appears to be a homeless man on a quest.  He is taken in by Kathleen, and  a major snowstorm and the failure of electricity force the three to live together through Christmas.

  While all of the acting is superb, there is special chemistry between Stewart and  Watkins that testifies to their depth as performers and their ability to get the most out of a scene.  For Stewart especially, this film makes the most of her ability, using  her in every scene and requiring that she go through the gamut of emotions.

  It must also be mentioned that in some  independent films, sadly family  ones, the quality of photography, sound and music can be a problem.  That is not the case with A Christmas Snow which we believe will measure up to any film from a major motion picture company.  Director and founder of Trost Moving Pictures, Tracy Trost  uses the utmost care in his work. This has already been tested in several major film festivals where the film has been previewed.  It has won top awards including best picture and best direction.

  In our opinion, if this were a theatrical release  it would be a candidate for Oscars in several categories.  Definitely best actress for Catherine Mary Stewart.",1285977600,175,2271,4.740359897172237

It's one of those films that calls you into the family room on a brisk winter evening, sits you in a rocker by the fireplace, turns off the phones, makes your house smell like evergreen, and gives you a big cup of hot chocolate.  Your family surrounds you and the children are cuddled up quietly on a blanket; the mortgage becomes a distant memory, and the job has let you go on a long-term vacation.  It's quiet, it's peaceful, and you feel nostalgia from those days long ago when it was really a special thing to watch family Christmas reruns and specials.

The movie begins, and you know that there will be nothing to cringe at, nothing that requires small ears to be covered, nothing that makes you confused or angry. And though you don't yet know the epiphanic ending -- the words spoken and the absence of ""actors"" will draw you in and give you comfort unlike any in recent times.

Watch this film and let warm memories and sentiment come into your heart.  Then watch it again!

A Christmas Snow.",1285891200,2,1042,4.4867724867724865
4234810,5,B003ZJK4HW,I absolutely love this movie!  My niece is Cameron ten Napel and she does a wonderful job!  This movie taught me that forgiveness is very important.  You can't exceed in life if you are holding onto past hurts and this movie does an excellent job at making one realize this lesson.  Love love love it!!!,1285891200,3,303,4.454545454545454
4234811,5,B003ZJK4HW,"First off I will state that I am a friend of Catherine Mary Stewart's who plays Kathleen in the film.  With that out of the way, I have to say that I have not been touched by a film for a long time like I have been by A Christmas Snow.

A Christmas Snow takes us into the life of Kathleen, a successful chef and restaurateur.  On the surface Kathleen's life looks golden.  Successful business, Attractive and successful boyfriend (Anthony Tyler Quinn), a nice home.  But as Christmas approaches and her employees ask for the day off, we learn there is more going on than meets the eye.  Kathleen's  father left she and her mom at Christmas.  An act that destroyed the very holiday for her and drove a wedge into her relationship with her mom.

When her boyfriend is called out of town and has no one to care for his daughter Lucy (Cameron ten Napel), Kathleen reluctantly takes on the task.  Neither of them are thrilled with the situation.

To add to the madness, Christmas is just a few days away, Kathleen is nearly mugged and is saved by a stranger, Sam (Muse Watson) and a record snow closes all the airports and roads and strands Sam from getting a bus to visit his daughter for the holidays.  The three complete strangers are forced to hold up at Kathleen's, waiting the storm out with out any amenities.

It's within the confines of this comfortable home that we see the 3 main charters truly bloom.

We learn that Sam is estranged from his own family and has decided this year to see if there is any way to fix what has been broken. Lucy reminds Kathleen what it really is like to be a child, especially at this magical time of year.  And Kathleen begins to see herself in terms of a whole person that realizes how much she has lost by shutting down her emotions and narrowing her own world.

Muse Watson plays the quiet, gentle Sam with such power that you simply can not help but watch him during all his scenes.  Cameron plays Lucy with just the right amount of brattyiness and precociousness that fits her character in the beginning, starting with her restaurant scene and informing Cathleen that she is a ""ckick-a-tarian"", and building to a sensitive young woman who Kathleen can begin to identify with.  Catherine brings so much depth and maturity to her role that you can't help but feel for the struggles that she is going through.  Her scene with Muse in which the 2 lay open their lives and fears is one worth watching over and over again.

While such words as ""small independent film"", ""family movie"" or ""faith based"" brings to mind poorly executed films, A Christmas Snow rises above all expectations and delivers a first rate, powerfully told, film that will be enjoyed for generations to come.",1285891200,5,2716,4.526639344262295
4234812,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I absolutely LOVED this movie!  While it was still warm outside, I got so into the movie that I felt the need for a cup of cocoa and a warm afghan to curl up with while I watched.  The actors are fresh and natural, while the storyline is inspiring and heartwarming. You'll laugh, you'll cry ( I know I did!) and in the end, you'll come away with that great warm fuzzy feeling the truly great Christmas movies leave you with.

This movie really made me think about my own family, about traditions, relationships, and forgiveness. I know I'll be watching it again and again this season and beyond!",1285891200,2,595,4.440366972477064
4234813,5,B003ZJK4HW,I was able to see this film several times and cried and laughed more each time I saw it. It so touched me. It is a wonderful story of the importance of forgiveness and what can happen to us if we hold onto the hurts. I highly recommend the book Restored that is a follow up to the movie. Be sure to see the movie before you read the book or it will spoil the movie for you.,1285891200,3,373,3.7948717948717947
4234814,5,B003ZJK4HW,"A Christmas Snow is a perfect family movie, filled with a wonderful message about forgiveness, blended families, as well as what Christmas should be about... spending time with families, love, love and LOVE!  This would be a great gift for anyone in your family!  Great date night movie, great family night movie to grab, or even to watch by yourself.!

Keep making more movies like this!  this is what our country needs!  Someone needs to mail one to the President himself!!",1285891200,2,617,4.728971962616822
4234815,5,B003ZJK4HW,"what makes a good film? beauty,actors,music,cinematography? weve all seen great christmas films like titanic, miracle on 34th street and home alone but what is christmas really about?? FAMILY.. there is 2 words to describe this film, HEART BREAKING & HEART WARMING. This film decribes life as it is and the hardships it intails. love and family are the single most important aspects in life and this film will have you thinking of the greatest memories of your family you ever had and the greatest times and love you shared together. this christmas will change for one women as the time of year approaches as she always chooses to neglect..but this year maybe things will be diffrent. Catherine Mary Stewart (knight rider) and Muse Watson (prison break) tell the story of love and family at the most important time of year. from director Tracy J Trost this christmas make sure you and your loved ones remember the true meaning of love. A CHRISTMAS SNOW IS A MUST SEE!",1285891200,2,967,4.796407185628743

8410466,1,B003ZJK4HW,Lol. I wanted to give this 5 stars as a joke but noticed people actually were genuinely giving it 5 stars. This movie was bad from the start but became unbearable right around the time the guy jogged into the street sign for absolutely no reason. This is a great movie if you just want to sit around and make fun of it.,1504224000,,319,4.079365079365079
8410467,5,B003ZJK4HW,this has become a perennial favorite at Christmas. Most Christmas movies today are comedies or romantic comedies...this is a bit different,1502841600,,138,5.619047619047619
8410468,5,B003ZJK4HW,Have always loved this movie.  AND it gives us a nice message too!  Has been a hard dvd to find and really a bit pricey.....but I bought it because of the fact it is so hard to find.  Just a sweet story with good actors.,1501286400,,220,3.8444444444444446
8410469,5,B003ZJK4HW,"This is a lovely movie. It is the only movie in my library that consistently leaves me misty-eyed. Watching the relationships develop was what made ""A Christmas Snow"" feel authentic. The theme of forgiveness is skillfully woven throughout. It is definitely a Christian movie, but never resorts to preaching to get its point across.",1495843200,,331,5.148148148148148

8410471,5,B003ZJK4HW,"I came upon this movie last year on an inspirational channel. Never having heard of it, I had no idea what to expect. A huge fan of Christmas and Christmas movies, I settled in to watch.

An aura of spiritual mystery becomes evident within the first few scenes. Subtle hints as to Sam's identity appear throughout the film. The camera view from above. Sam's amazing strength. His wistful look as he waves goodbye to Kathleen on the morning of Christmas Eve. But it's not until Kathleen opens the oft overlooked package that we begin to realize just who Sam is.

I was going to list all the hints. I won't. I'll leave it for the viewer. But don't miss them. Don't miss the message portrayed. Let your heart be touched. Let the message of this movie change you.

A heartwarming story of forgiveness, love, and faith, this is an unusual movie. I purchased the DVD and have watched it 20 times. I'll watch it 20 more.",1485475200,,913,4.4879518072289155
