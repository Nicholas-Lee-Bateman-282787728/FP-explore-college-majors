This is a awsome DVD because of its strong and exhilarative music, the choirs that accompanied Dottie Peoples sing with power and confidence. I was especially touched by the interview with Dottie, her childlike , genteel and benevolent presence is touching as she shares her life experiences. I also enjoy her most when she sings ""All My Help"" and ""God Can & God Will"" here, she expresses her spritual emotions as it reflects her personal walk with god. Dottie's magawatt and anointed voice is exhilarting and uplifting. THIS IS MUST BUY DVD FOR GOSPEL MUSIC LOVERS.
Yours Truly,

Well, let me tell you; after watching this video and listening to the great songs. You will know who she is and where she is from. A very sweet woman with an electrifying voice. This video is a must have if you like great gospel music.  We need more, more, more, gospel music on DVD.
