8590481,1,B00006HAX5,"This has got to be the most disappointing ""visual experience"" I have ever shared with Status Quo.  The film footage is constantly polluted with text overlays and moving footers describing what topical events took place over the years that various songs were popular, as well as the constant switching from colour to black and white photography which affects both the sight and sound quality.  The whole production has a ""Pop Up Video"" feel about it and comes across like a project completed by a group of first year audio-visual students!  There are some excellent Quo concerts available on VHS format - such as Alive Alive Quo! - and this DVD really isn't worth the money it costs.",1030320000,6,682,4.811965811965812
