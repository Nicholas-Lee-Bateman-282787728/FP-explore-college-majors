3803246,1,B001UNVDZC,"And that's my son's quote, after having watched this. There is a picture of Nessie on it, and given the title, one certainly thinks it will be a movie about the Loch Ness monster. Not so. Swears, bad dubbing, terrible CGI, and a tepid love story. Awful. My kid was irate, and I was too.",1402876800,6,286,4.218181818181818
3803247,2,B001UNVDZC,"This could have been a cute movie for kids; I have a grandson the same age at Tim, and he wears the same style of glasses so I thought it would be perfect for him to see a little hero just like himself.  Then, Tim starts lying, and even gets his grandfather to lie for him.  But even more, I questioned if I should show it to him (and his older brother) because of the frequent profanity.  The matter was settled when little Tim started swearing.  I will not show it to them.  This is one movie NOT to show your kids or grandchildren unless you want them to use profanity or become proficient liars.  It's too bad . . . it could have been a nice, wholesome family movie.",1348012800,7,670,4.115384615384615
3803248,2,B001UNVDZC,This movie should only be seen on tv and is not worth spending the money.  Even the grandkids were disappointed.,1345939200,5,112,4.6
3803249,1,B001UNVDZC,"The ""secret"" of this film is that Nessie is as elusive in this film as she is in real life.  I watched the film with my 5 year old daughter, both of us expected to see a child-friendly adventure film about a boy searching for his father and Scotland's famous cryptid. The creature on the DVD cover IS NOT IN THE FILM!
I can not look over the fact that the monster only makes a few cameo appearances, which are just waves or shadowy images.

Parents beware, there are several swear words in the script that do not add to the film at all and are totally unnecessary.
I still can't understand why the director allowed this, as it adds nothing to the film. It makes me wonder of the original German version of this film had swearing in it, or were they added when the English dialog was dubbed in?

Somehow I think that this was once a run of the mill pre-teen adventure flick, recut to include dialog that tries to trick the viewer into thinking that this is a film about the Loch Ness Monster.

Stick with ""Waterhorse"" if you are looking for a family friendly film about sea monsters.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Water-Horse-Legend-of-the-Deep-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0012IWO0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Water Horse - Legend of the Deep (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>",1274745600,9,1320,5.097222222222222
3803250,5,B001UNVDZC,"This is a gem of loch ness movies, It's a German film but it's in english, no subtitles. It's about a kid who is 11 years old. His mom told him his dad was dead, and she gave him a picture of his dad. Well the little boy was really into the loch ness monster. When he was watching something about it on tv he sees the man who is the same man in the picture his mom gave him. So he goes to loch ness to find him. When he gets there he meets the man and tells him that he is writing a paper for his school. So he askes him if he has any family, and the man says no. While out in the boat with the man he falls overboard and sinks. The man dives for him but can't find him. About 5 minutes later the little boy Tim is laying in an underground cave. He jumps up when he sees the lochness monster and then he hears a voice behind him. He turns and sees a Hobbit, a amazing little creature who is actually the protector of meryln the wizards treasure. They begin an adventure which he has to help save the day. The loch ness creature is actually a robot which the hobbit uses to protect the treasure and lochness. At the end he finds out that the man he meets is actually his dad. This is a great movie, with very good special effects and an amazing hobbit. Great for kids although their are a few curse words in it, but other than that is a wonderful fantasy.",1263600000,2,1354,3.9272727272727272

8344548,4,B001UNVDZC,"Great kid movie. It has fantasy, action and a love story. A fatherless boy believes an anthropologist is his father and he gets his dotty grandfather to help him get to Scotland where the anthropologist is working. Once he arrives, he has many incredible adventures with strange creatures and a killer who wants treasure.",1470355200,,321,4.962962962962963

8344550,2,B001UNVDZC,"I rented this movie for my 8 yr old grandson, because he loves things like the Loch Ness monster.  The boy goes with strangers twice...the humor is crude and unnecessary for the story line, and that's just the part we watched.",1418342400,,226,4.512195121951219
8344551,1,B001UNVDZC,This movie has almost nothing to do with the Loch Ness Monster.  Picked it up from Redbox because my little girl is learning about this Scottish legend.  Instead it's a ridiculous magical story about a creature that looks and moves an awful lot like Gollum.  Very disappointed.  Lots of swearing too - even by the child.  Wish I'd previewed this one; wouldn't have shown it to my daughter.,1414022400,,389,4.661764705882353

8344553,1,B001UNVDZC,"It started out as a low-budget family-friendly movie but then Oki showed up and it suddenly took a scary turn for my 6 year old. Also, too much profanity for a PG rating and the plot was extremely lame and had several sexist jokes. This is a great candidate for an MST3K riffing though. Oki looks like a cgi student project of a mix between Gollam and ET.",1407974400,2,355,4.235294117647059
8344554,1,B001UNVDZC,"Not about the loch Ness monster at all. My kids commented that the movie was so confusing because they expected something totally different. The voice-overs are bad enough, and then they had to include several curse words, which could have easily been left out. Because of the high number of curse words, I would not consider this a family movie at all. I am honestly shocked that it is labeled as such.",1405382400,4,403,4.611111111111111
8344555,1,B001UNVDZC,"My kids picked this one out based on the cover and synopsis. What we got was a lumbering movie with poor English actors doing the English dub, very little Nessie, and lots of profanity even from the 11 year old protagonist. The children declared it ""terrible"" and I had to discuss with them why it is not appropriate for them to use several words.",1403913600,4,347,4.4375
