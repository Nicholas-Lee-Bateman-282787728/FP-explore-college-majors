8426876,5,B004EFX360,I had one of Kamala's hoop dvd's from years ago and tried to find it on Amazon to no avail. It was the only class where I smiled and laughed the whole class A must for anyone. Found this current one and LOVE IT. The best video for melting your abs to the core!! I'm 69 yrs old and greatly fit for my age after hooping when I turned 65.,1433289600,,335,3.8
8426877,1,B004EFX360,This hoop is a total waste of money!  Didn't even get it around twice before it fell apart.  The connectors are plastic tubes and when you piece it together it is hard to get it into a perfect circle.  My daughter had the same problem with it coming apart when she used it.  I think this product would be better if it came as one solid piece.,1299888000,,342,4.059701492537314
8426878,2,B004EFX360,"I bought ""Cardio Hoop"" yesterday, along with the Ultra Hoop to add to my routine. Being that this was my first Hoop experience, I was looking for something very basic and easy to follow; I found ""Cardio Hoop"" to be just the thing. I liked that Kamala Mathis explained each move before starting or moving to the next, and that each step was repeated enough times to get the hang of it without having to pause, practice, rewind.
I just wish I were equally satisfied with the Ultra Hoop. I initially loved this product because it's large and weighted, so I really had to work the core and lower body to get the thing moving. Having said that however, the hoop kept falling apart during the workout and eventually broke just as I was starting to feel the burn.
I'm returning the Ultra Hoop, but keeping the ""Cardio Hoop"" DVD with hopes of finding a better quality hoop.",1299628800,,865,4.481012658227848
8426879,2,B004EFX360,"I'm giving this two stars because Kamala is fun to watch. However, I cannot do the workout with her because this hoop keeps falling apart. I have tried to put it together for the past 30 mins and still can't get it to stay in one piece while I do the moves. Having the hoop falling apart all over the place could be dangerous - especially if someone else was in the room to witness this fiasco.

Save your money for a better quality product.",1299456000,,441,4.188235294117647
