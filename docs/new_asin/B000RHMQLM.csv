2867423,5,B000RHMQLM,"AIR is one of those rare anime where nothing disappoints. As other reviewers, I've also seen a lot of anime, and find few that can stun me on all levels as AIR continues to do with each watching. Breathtaking animation, hauntingly magical music throughout the opening, closing and background songs, and a story that so enthralls time seems to stop when watching it unfold.

The tale told throughout AIR is so wonderful that I cannot truly say more then has been said in other reviews for fear of spoiling it for others, so I will only echo that AIR is truly the sweepingly epic romantic fantasy others have said, one that defies time itself, and one which is worthy of more praise then words alone are capable of expressing. Truly AIR should not be missed by those longing for a beautiful epic story.",1187827200,13,800,4.594405594405594
2867424,5,B000RHMQLM,"AIR is without a doubt, the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of anime. The animation: blessed by the legendary Kyoto Ani studios, AIR is a stunning visual piece with sweeping backgrounds and gorgeously crisp and original character designs. Everything is beautiful, from Misuzu's golden hair blowing in the summer breeze to the stills of the sun setting in a reddish-purple sky, its an aesthetic masterpiece and the eye candy will keep you entertained throughout. The soundtrack: perfectly crafted to inspire visions of a summer's day, the music sweeps the viewer along in its own quiet, poignant way. Most memorable is the piano track called 'Summer Lights'; from the very first episode you just know that sweet little tune will stay in your memory forever. Worthy of mention is the vocalist LIA, who provides the haunting opening theme, the uplifting ending theme and the tear jerking insert song Aozora-her angelic vocals send shivers down my spine every time. The characters: even the supporting cast stole my heart in this anime, although they weren't fleshed out as well as they could have been. However it was Misuzu, Yukito and their ancestral counterparts that really stole my heart once the main arc of the story sets in. Not to spoil anything-but the ending is beautiful, if heart wrenching. The story: AIR is a tale of innocence, hope, and a love that transcends time, all told during one fateful summer where a Misuzu, a lonely young school girl finds a friend in a travelling puppeteer named Yukito who is searching for 'the winged girl waiting in the sky' that his mother told him of. But supernatural events from their past lives are catching up to them, and this summer might just be their chance to break the cycle of doomed love and sorrow that has lasted for a thousand years. Worthy of every good word ever said about it, AIR is truly a masterpiece, and if you enjoy beautiful meaningful anime such as Spirited Away and Rahxephon you will undoubtedly enjoy this.",1183593600,32,2006,4.834302325581396
8200782,5,B000RHMQLM,"This is the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. I saw a youtube video on it and I couldn't resist looking it up and after watching just one episode, I was hooked. The animation is amazing. Everything from the clear ocean to the breathtaking sunset to the haunting looks on the characters faces are.....indescribable. The music compliments the anime perfectly. The characters and stories are amazing. Kano and her back story is so eerie and interesting. Minagi and Michiru are two unforgettable characters. Their story is so bittersweet, I was unsure whether to smile or cry. Ryuya and Kanna, Yukito and Misuzu were the most agonizingly painful and lingering characters I have ever seen. Just the idea of love that spans thousands of years is moving. The idea of freedom, the price of love, and sacrifices is so memorable, i know I will never forget. Air is so unique in its ability to make you feel. While watching this i just wanted to cry. Air lingers in the viewers mind and leaves an everlasting effect. There is so much to learn from an anime like Air. Air is something that makes you  feel the emotions of the character, their pains are your pains. Air is unforgettable and anyone who has never seen it must go watch it right now. It's beauty and perfection is to great to be ignored. Air tv and all the characters in it have had an everlasting effect on me, hopefully it has the same effect on others.",1239408000,,1411,4.5770750988142295
8200783,5,B000RHMQLM,"This is currently one of my favorite animes.  I think my favorite character would have to be Potato, a little stray dog that is just so fun to watch.

I also love the story lines to this anime.  They're great to watch, and keep you interested to the very end.",1231632000,,259,4.14
8200784,4,B000RHMQLM,"I was looking for something good to watch last year, and I watched Air TV. It's got a complex story, beautiful graphics, towards the end very sad, and nice music. Overall, I loved it, I just hated the ending like so many other anime series I've watched. The graphics are really something though, it almost seemed like it could jump off the picture.",1217721600,,348,4.5396825396825395
8200785,4,B000RHMQLM,"This DVD is full of lovely art work, great character designs, a promise of a supernatural story that spans the centuries.  And a freaky alien dog that is named Potato and seems to understand everything said to him.  Love the voice talents,such as Vic Mignogna, Monica Rial, Kira Vincent-Davis, and there are a ton of them in the credits I know and have even met in person.  The feel is wonderful.  A mixture of romantic hope and dark fantasy.  There is an underlining feel of doom and death just around the corner.  The first DVD is full of promise.  But it lacks a touch, that spark, that makes a nice anime into a great one.  Maybe the dog makes it too cute.  I would suggest getting it used.",1205798400,,694,4.359375
8200786,3,B000RHMQLM,"I've been on the look out for sad and depressing anime ever since finishing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-and-Then-Here-and-There-Complete-Collector-s-Boxed-Set/dp/B000063K2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>, so when someone pointed me towards Air TV I was more then happy to try it out. At first glance Air seems like the pure definition of a heartwarming, yet sad tale, but once you get past the initial tear jerking moments found in abundance in volume one, the story really has very little to offer. Yukito is a young traveling puppeteer who moves from town to town searching for a mysterious person who he calls ""the girl in the sky."" one day, tired and hungry, he stumbles into a small coastal town and meets a young, energetic, girl named Misuzu who seems to be as clumsy as she is cute and charming. Although Misuzu is the main focus of the show, Yukito meets three other misfit girls, each one, much like Misuzu, hide their own secrets and deal with their own personal problems, some of which will leave you breathless. If I were to compare this show with another anime, I'd say it has a lot more in common with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haibane-Renmei-Complete-Vols-1-4/dp/B0009ZE9WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haibane-Renmei: Complete Vols. 1-4</a>&nbsp;then anything else, but where Renmei slowly builds up its momentum to a captivating finish, Air slowly fizzles out and allows itself to die long before the closing scene. This show, in all honesty, should have been four episodes shorter, for although I understand where they were trying to go with the ending, I couldn't help but feel that it was rushed, unprepared, and mellow dramatic. Where the opening is nothing but pure heartbreaking tragedy, the ending manages to somehow turn an otherwise great story into a cheesy soap opera with Misuzu and her mom taking center stage at the expense of every other character the creators of this show worked so hard to develop.

And that's where this show ultimately fails, in my opinion. Characters like Kano, Tohno, and Michiru get so much attention in the first half of the series that when they suddenly drop off the map nothing felt right anymore. They are very well developed characters with some very serious problems but after maybe two episodes devoted to each, after their lives are suddenly and magically put back together thanks Yukito they are no longer necessary parts of the story and are dropped altogether. Why, I wonder, did the writers bother to put them into this story if they weren't going to play any significant role in the overall plot? Why bother? It isn't as if the story needed them, although they did add some touching moments. Their characters were far too well developed and their stories far too touching to be dropped completely after they served their purpose.

The art work is nothing sort of amazing. I defy anyone to show me an anime series more visually beautiful then this. Every frame is a masterpiece of artistic brilliance found only in anime movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voices-of-a-Distant-Star/dp/B00008G8QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voices of a Distant Star</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Place-Promised-in-Our-Early-Days/dp/B0009PLMAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a>. The character designs may be a bit clich, with the stereotypical long hair, enormous watery eyes, school girl uniforms, etc. but they have a personal feel that ultimately made the characters seem more real, more alive, and that's all that matters in the end. To accompany these visuals, this show boasts a very quiet, very sweet and haunting musical score, mostly piano pieces that reminded me very much of Voices of a Distant Star. I didn't even realize until the last few episodes that they were just playing the same three songs over and over again, and even then it didn't matter. Numerous times I found myself ignoring the dialogue and just listening to the sweet melodies of the soundtrack and watching the beautiful visuals.

In all this show starts out extremely strong, but somehow manages to ruin an amazing story with an ending soap opera writers would be proud of. The series really ends at volume three, or at least that's where it should have been, everything after that, although it has its occasional moments, ruins all credibility this show had as a drama. Watch this show for the visuals, the soundtrack, and heartbreaking opening, and nothing else.

Replay value; Very low.",1204588800,6,4732,5.558945908460472
8200787,5,B000RHMQLM,"Ok, this is such a good anime, I can watch it over and over again. AIR is about a guy named Yukito, who is a traveling puppeteer. He is looking for the girl in the sky while on his journeys, and in one town he makes friends with a young girl named Misuzu. Yukito stays with her and her 'guardian' and takes care of her sometimes :P Misuzu tells Yukito about some strange dreams that happen, and Yukito thinks they are connected to the girl in the sky. Yukito makes other friends too, like Kano and Minagi, oh and Potato (sp?) as well :) Yukito helps his friends to get though ruff times and shares happy ones with them too!",1198540800,3,623,4.2
8200788,5,B000RHMQLM,"As others have given a good synopsis, I will simply give my opinion of this  series.
""Air"" is a beautiful story, backed by amazing animation, breath-taking stills, and an enchanting soundtrack. Air gave me a sense of wonder and  innocence that I have rarely felt in my adult life.  It was easy to become emotionally attached to every major character in Air. I highly recommend this wonderful series to anyone that likes anime. My only regret is that the story ended...gao.

I suggest purchasing ""Kanon,"" if you are interested in more from the makers of ""Air.""",1196899200,,559,4.791666666666667
8200789,5,B000RHMQLM,"Positives:
The characters are the series. That is, it is the character development throughout the story that drives this show. You see the lives of the girls through Yukito's (and later, Sora's) eyes as he, a wandering traveler at first, stumbles into their lives and gets caught into the legend of the winged girl in the sky.
The animation quality is second to none. It is vibrant, fluid, and artistic.
The music is as equally beautiful as the animation.
A very strong plot is woven throughout the series (with a few side stories along the way) that leads to the most powerful ending in an animated show I have ever seen! A very emotional series.
Negatives / warnings:
The dubbing is just above average, but in no way compares to the quality of acting of the original voices. But if you can't stand watching subs, then the dubbing will impress you.
Whether it is my DVD player or US encoding issues, I see some interlacing issues during the motion-rich introduction. But they are minor and probably won't be noticed by most.
No details are ever shown, but it is evident during the ""prequel"" story that a girl become naked. The outline of her nude body is revealed, like seeing a mannequin. This also occurs in the intro for a second.
During one of the ""summer specials"" (which I am not sure will be released), the girl tries to seduce her guardian as a test of his loyalties. As you would expect, he passes the test.
Last, the series relies heavily on Eastern mysticism for the plot. Curses, seals, talismans, reincarnation, mind-control, and other mystical objects/concepts are important to the show and plot.",1191283200,3,1611,4.716312056737588
8200790,5,B000RHMQLM,"The animation for this series is just beautiful, with a short and interesting story. Kyoto Animation does a wonderful job of animating this series, with beautiful music to go with it.
I don't want to ruin the story so I'll just give a very brief synopsis: When a wondering puppeteer arrives at a town he meets three girls that dream about ""a girl in the sky"", as the story unfolds we learn his family legacy and how it is intertwined with the life of that elusive ""girl in the sky"".
This first volume contains the first four episodes of the series, leaving you wanting for more. It is a good buy if you are a fan of fantasy and romance animes. Another recommendation would be Ceres: Celestial Being and The Story of Saiunkoku.",1190160000,,726,4.466165413533835
8200791,5,B000RHMQLM,"This is the most beautiful anime I have ever bought in my entire life! Its beautiful in both ways artwork and story the leaves and land and water, everything! The story also is as beautiful as the artwork I say anyone thinking on buying this should I am very glad I did!!!",1189296000,2,272,4.25
