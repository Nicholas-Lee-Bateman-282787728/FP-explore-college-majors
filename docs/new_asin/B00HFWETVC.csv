6162178,3,B00HFWETVC,If you are really into documentaries this a pretty good retelling of the old west with good acting and reenactments.  I found it a tad boring for my taste but to each their own.  The information was very good though.,1400025600,7,216,4.375
6162179,4,B00HFWETVC,"There was a clear and consistent effort to be as accurate and authentic as possible in the creation of this DVD series. The historical recreations are intense, layered and detailed with great care in the costumes, weapons, sets and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories of the Old West Lawmen and bad guys (white hats and black hats) to life for a mass audience - from the Civil War to the end of the 19th century.  Lots of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and his pards.",1397952000,6,563,4.574257425742574

8632567,2,B00HFWETVC,"Repetitious use of dramatized clips. 'Ike Clanton'  showed up later as some sheriff or marshal.  annoying. A  l o t  of old photos and film clips are used with commentary dramatization. a  little live action re enactment stuff.  No interviewed commentators.  Hickok is portrayed with  'heavy type'  pistols said to be perl handled.  He is dramatized and shown with one Shoulder stock capable 1851 perl handled revolver and one , ,  what seems to be a Starr or something.  I  r e a l l y  liked the way in which the story was told with the acting and use of old footage and stills.  It s  just that it was edited in a way where it is like a 5th grader did it.",1483833600,,658,4.185483870967742
8632568,4,B00HFWETVC,"Nice blu ray for the price, Wasn't exactly what i expected but for the price i paid you can't go wrong.  Has lots of early US history besides what we normally think of the old west.",1477526400,,181,4.027777777777778

8632570,4,B00HFWETVC,"It is an ambitious six part series that tries to cover the swath of time from the beginning of the westward movement in the US through the taming of the west.

The production quality is good, the sets impressive, and the details are well done.

It is a lot of material to cover in six episodes.  So, at times, things felt a bit rushed.

Still, this is one of the best surveys of the Old West out there, and I highly recommend it for those interested in history as well as the role-playing crowd that might be interested in more flavor for western setting games.",1469923200,,561,4.314285714285714
8632571,4,B00HFWETVC,"This documentary takes a different tack than similar series. Instead of beginning ""in media res"", it attempts to show that Western violence was not due only to white/red conflict, but was also provoked and exacerbated by the Civil War. It's not until the third episode that the ""lawmen"" take a significant role.

Most of the ""re-enactments"" are taken from old movies (some silent). The modern re-enactments suffer from using actors who rarely even remotely resemble the characters they're supposed to be. (""Doc Holliday"", in particular, is way off.)

On the other hand, the narration makes direct, heavy use of contemporary material, rather than the writer's interpretation of it. Likewise, there's a tendency to let the material speak for itself, rather than trying to unravel fact from fiction. The generally overwrought 19th-century prose makes things hard to follow at times, but serious viewers are likely to prefer this unvarnished presentation.

On the Blu-ray, the newly produced scenes have beautiful color and lots of detail. If you have a Blu-ray player, that's the version to get.",1460678400,,1092,5.264367816091954
8632572,4,B00HFWETVC,Satisfied with purchase,1459296000,,23,7.0
8632573,4,B00HFWETVC,I always find this western history interesting and this is a well done series.,1445385600,,78,4.642857142857143
8632574,3,B00HFWETVC,"Not great, but at greatly discounted price as good as reading a fair book on the topic.

Throughout the 6 part series, the same re-enactment scenes are used over and over again. The rest of the videography, tacked in here and there, comes from Black and White B Westerns and have little to do with the story being told (other than maybe the word ""Stage Coach"" was mentioned and the scene shows a stage). Even the re-enactment scenes are re-used (multiple times in the same segment) and completely out of place.

Trying to synch what is being shown vs what is being told will drive your brain into confusion.

The best parts of the series are when the narrator is reading from a diary or first hand account. Then you're getting some useful perspective. I can't account for the accuracy of all the information but it did offer varying perspective on incidents. Listening to the specific paragraphs cited probably saves some time - rather than reading an entire book on say ""Gunfight at The O.K. Corral"" - for short review this beats combing through volumes. But, don't try to match what is being shown with what is being said. Most of the images shown can be ignored as they have little to no application to the material being presented.

The six parts to the series suggest a broad perspective on The West, the movement West, and how it affected the lives in that time. There is a small amount of this, but the series focuses on a handful of key individuals/events and keeps portraying them in each of the segments. Although the segments have different titles, they aren't really presenting an analysis of that topic specifically - rather it views the same incidents in terms of that segment's viewpoint. So, what you wind up getting is a narrow historical view reviewed over and over.

I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't recommend or ask anyone I know to sit through it.",1444521600,4,1868,4.6314199395770395
