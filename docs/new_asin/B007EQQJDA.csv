8515316,5,B007EQQJDA,"As one other reviewer put it - it was like hanging out with Mick Fleetwood for an afternoon. Not lengthy on formal lessons, but filled with great advice & tips from someone who's ""been there and done that"", sprinkled with humor and wit. A great video, and a ""must"" for any Fleetwood Mac fan.",1413072000,,291,4.407407407407407
8515317,5,B007EQQJDA,"I must say I'm really glad that I did not listen to these lukewarm reviews before purchasing this DVD. I've purchased many drum DVDs over the years and I actually think this one is my all-time favorite. Yes maybe it does feel like it was produced in a weekend in somebody's garage or studio. But who cares? How valuable would it be to you to have Mick Fleetwood sitting in your garage for a weekend talking from the heart about drumming? I found the whole thing absolutely captivating and could not stop watching. His discussion of dynamics in blues for example, I've never heard it really explained that way. Watching this DVD has already affected the way I approach the drums. I loved it. Get this DVD especially if you are a drummer who is looking to really fit into a great band. Music is after all about the songs, the melody, the lyrics, and the drums must support all this, which Mick Fleetwood totally understands. If you want to learn to shred solos that will put your audience to sleep, then get the latest Peart DVD, but for the drummer who really wants to play live music with other musicians, this DVD is an indispensable addition to any good drum video collection.",1392854400,,1178,4.535211267605634
8515318,3,B007EQQJDA,"I am a big fan - from all the way back to the John Mayall and Peter Green days. And I am a drummer.  I don't regret the purchase but think it could easily have been much better. First there was no explanation of the Go Your Own Way drum pattern. Big oversight. Then there was nothing on practicing (what does Mick think about rudiments?) tuning, mics, set up or recording. The video sounds very good and looks OK but has the overall feeling it was put together in a weekend.",1348531200,,474,4.208791208791209
8515319,3,B007EQQJDA,"First I love Mick and all of Fleetwood Mac's stuff from the Peter Green days until now. As a drummer who has wanted Mick to do a DVD like this for some time I am a bit disappointed. While he does show you the patterns for Tusk and Rhiannon he skips Go Your Own Way - which is a huge oversight. (Maybe he would put that on YouTube?) Also he never mentions tuning, his mic and recording set up or how he practices.  And the segments, while filmed with excellent video audio quality, the whole thing feels like they whipped it up and did it in a weekend.  I do not regret the purchase.  I just think that if Mick looked at other sets like this and took a bit more time it could have been much better.",1348272000,,697,4.036231884057971
8515320,5,B007EQQJDA,"This is Mick Fleetwood.  A God among drummers.  This is not just for drummers though.  This DVD personifies what every musician, digital producer, singer and performer needs to know about being REAL and being a solid artist.  A must have for drummers - and everyone else!  Thanks for the depth and insight, Mick!!!!",1339977600,,315,4.867924528301887
