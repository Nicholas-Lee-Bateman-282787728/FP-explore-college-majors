8463909,2,B005BCE74W,"BEWARE: Don't be lured in by the ""small leaves"" on the cover. Not just for this, but for anything.  That is one of the oldest tricks in the book.  First of all, none of them are awards - they are ""official selections.""  Many film festivals accepts hundreds and hundreds of films, many with no merit whatsoever.  Often all you have to do is send in the film and pay a fee.  There, now you can put small leaves all over your merchandise.  If it said ""official selection competition,"" then it would mean that the film was selected among other ""official selections"" to be put into a smaller group, and then the festival jury will actually WATCH AND VOTE ON IT.  Translation: Official Selection usually means next to nothing.

Anyway.

If you love simple-minded cheesy romantic Christian comedies, then this is the film for you.

The good - the actors are fantastic with the dialogue they are given, it is not bad for a very amateur filmmaker, and the friendship between the two male leads rings pretty true.  Their bickering made me laugh a few times and reflected how a lot of men act in real life.

The ugly?  First, it has so many typical romantic comedy cliches.  I won't spoil it for you, but it's uncomfortably slow-paced, predictable, one-dimensional, sloppily edited, and awkward.  Plots are dropped then brought back and tried to put back together cohesively, but it just doesn't work.  There's also a silly ""twist"" at the end that really doesn't have a point.

While the two male leads are not bad, Abbey and her best friend?  Wow.  They try to make them super witty, and like I said, the actresses are good for what they're given, but the dialogue made me cringe.  Abbey also lacks any kind of character development.  Her only real point in this movie is to desire a man that meets her high expectations....and yep, that's it.  I felt bad that this obviously good actress had to work with such shoddy and unnatural dialogue.

The film tries to be cute and whimsical but also serious, and it doesn't do a good job of it.  Lots of eye rolling and sighs.  The film is snobby and obviously thinks it is something WAY better than it is.  Is it good for the whole family?  Sure, but don't count on the whole family staying awake.

And I'd like to mention that I'm a born-again Christian and am always looking for really unique, inspiring Christian films, so I don't mind the Christian undertones at all - it has NOTHING to do with that.  There are plenty of other amazing romantic Christian-themed comedies out there.

I feel bad for saying this because I think the creators mean well - but Works in Progress is simply drivel.  It lacks cohesion, moves at an awkward pace, the two females are terribly written, and worst of all - it's just too cheesy.  And that's saying a LOT from me, because I'm bit of a romantic and love my share of chick flicks, especially if there are Christian themes involved.  My husband did not enjoy this movie either, so that is another point of view from a very serious Christian, family-oriented man.  He said he felt many times as if he was about to fall asleep, and he never says that.

Even if you're a Christian, please stay away from this AWFULLY WRITTEN movie and check out one of the ones I mentioned.  I also think the actors are very talented, so I hope they can actually find real roles that showcase their talent. 2 stars instead of 1 because I admire any amateur filmmaker who puts so much hard work into a movie revolving around Christian values (a rarity in this country these days) and the acting.  The rest is bad.",1352332800,3,3562,4.5266457680250785
8463910,5,B005BCE74W,"Works in Progress is a 2009 film by Never2Late productions, headed by Dr. Steven Pruitt of Kansas City Kansas. It has been shown in numerous film festivals to high reviews, notably the Heartland Film Festival in Indianapolis, which is where I saw it. It is a charming film about two art students heading to Kansas City to hopefully make their names in the art world. To tell any more might spoil it for those who have not yet seen it. It has a welcome balance of intelligence, humor, and impressive cinematography, with a little slapstick to boot. It is reassuring that a movie can be high quality these days WITHOUT the use of a single obscenity, exploding buildings or flaming guns. I recently had a film party in my house to show it to a few of my friends who all really enjoyed it. If you want an all too needed change from the usual puerile vulgar drivel being handed out by Hollywood these days, by all means see Works in Progress.",1322697600,12,937,4.453488372093023
