8325576,5,B000P9WDKG,"i am a guitarist, pianist, but i like to play the drums ... i learned some rudiments when i was younger but ... they've rusted. this dvd was exactly what i was hoping it would be ... something i could sit with, with my practice pad and play, pause, practice ... actually its way more than i was hoping for ... as i said im mainly a guitar player, and honestly i don't know much about setting up the drums and he even explains about positioning cymbals and toms ... there are years of ""private lessons"" in this DVD so it is well worth the price to me ... and watching the dvd, its obvious that brian is sharing many years of experience (eg going from the ride to the crash, cool!). it's really nuts to watch (and listen) to the notes flying out and he is barely moving lol ... but then again he explains ""the stroke"" so im sure with more views/practice time with the dvd, my body will stop doing 32cd's when im playing them! if you are thinking about getting this, don't hesitate. production quality is A+ ... there is a lot more advanced stuff (jazz, big band, etc) that i am not ready for yet. i don't feel qualified to review that part except that it seems any level of drummer could benefit from the DVD.",1303084800,,1207,4.229437229437229
8325577,5,B000P9WDKG,"I'm a former pro getting back to drumming after about 25 years away from the art.  What I needed was a good grounding in the most recent drumming styles as well as a referesher in technique.  Brian's DVD filled the bill and then some.  This DVD would be great for beginners through intermediate drummers. As well, there are some good licks for the more advanced guys too! This 3 hour DVD has it all - and more! Not only are there abundant exercises on rudiments, drum fills and grooves but there is a really cool segment on double bass drum techniques.  You've got to check out the section on different playing styles.  Not only do the grooves Brian details here in drum notation work ""in the real world""- which is not always the case in some DVDs and books I've researched, but he demonstrates (with his band) everything from 50s rock through funk and R&B; from sambas to jazz fusion and swing and New Orleans street rhythm. Brian is not only an extremly accomplished technician but he is an excellent teacher.  His lesson segments are not only easy to follow but if you work at it, you will obtain the building blocks useful to advance your drumming - no matter what style or background experience you have.  This is ONE OF THE BEST VALUES FOR MONEY to be had in a drumming DVD that you will find anywhere.  GET IT!!!",1277683200,,1319,4.466666666666667
8325578,5,B000P9WDKG,"I own several drum DVD's (and VHS), but I felt like my playing had hit a plateau for a few years.  A professional drummer I know and admire actually recommended this DVD:  Practical Drumming.  It cost the same as one drum lesson, so there was nothing to lose (plus this DVD is 3 times longer than a drum lesson).

I truly advanced after first watching this DVD and I will be going through it many more times.  There is plenty of content to warrant several viewings.

The DVD covers a wide range of topics and skill levels.  There are some foundational portions there were surprisingly new to me.  It is critical to build on a solid foundation, so I feel this alone helped me progress and break some old habits that were holding me back.

The more advanced parts introduced me to some new styles and broadened my awareness of drums and drumming in general.  I learned a lot of great new chops, too, that I could immediately incorporate into my playing.  I've also been able to blend some of different styles that were covered, creating some new and interesting rhythms.

The drummer, Brian Lutz, is a great instructor.  It helps that all the concepts he teaches are demonstrated in live performance scenarios.  I will get as much as I can from this DVD, and I hope to see future releases from this drummer.",1234224000,,1305,4.521367521367521
8325579,5,B000P9WDKG,"A MUST HAVE VIDEO/DVD!  Man, what a GREAT resource and I was seriously moved to comment on it as I am viewing it now. The production is first rate!! and must have taken quite a bit of planning and background work. It certainly was worth the effort.  The group playing was absolutely superb in all of those different musical playing styles and full-length performances!

Your chops are superb and I learned a thing or two during the explanations and playing examples for the Latin afro cuban section.  This DVD really breaks down alot of what is needed out there to be a successful all-around drum player - and this coming from a 20 year+ veteran of drums!  Some of those other videos blast through the most complicated of things that end up just sounding like exercises not applicable to any real music.  You certainly have the chops to pull off any of those so-called 'speed-demon exercises' that others fill up their whole video with, but you bring it to the point with not only the fast chops but with great demonstrations on the snare drum, drumset and within the great musical band line-up.

Thanks for creating such a great resourse for drumming all in one spot!  It's exactly what I needed to inspire and expand my playing potential!  I wish you much success with this video!",1194739200,,1282,4.6371681415929205
