592371,4,6303204163,"This 3rd was a little too comical for me, like with PINHEAD, FREDDY KRUEGER and LEATHERFACE, the Tall man is given a comic personality and with this film you get the idea of that. This is still a good film but it is  perhaps the worst of the 4 films. The limp humour does not suit the  PHANTASM series.",948672000,,302,4.101694915254237

592534,4,6303204163,"More sci-fi than horror reuniting the original cast to continue the phanstasm series in this 3rd enty on a larger scale and special effects budget. Unfortunately, there are some addtional characters the script would have been better without that appear to be added only to appear to a younger generation. These characters detract from the story without adding anything new or exciting and are the only negative to this movie.  There is an R and an unrated version which has a few more seconds of blood so be sure to get the unrated version.  This is one entertaining film from start to finish with a cliff hanger of an ending so be warned when it's over you want it to continue and the fourth DVD in this series is seling for high price.",1416355200,2,737,4.533834586466165

Also I thought the Hemicuda was destroyed in Phantasm II but Reggie restored another Hemicuda or that same car so fast and without a paying full time job that we know of?!  Well despite this second distortion in the movie you have to go back to Phantasm I and remember the deal with how Reggie was killed but then that turned out to be a ""dream"" and Jody ended up being the one who died....

592593,5,6303204163,"This is my favorite Phantasm film ever. It is campy, crazy, gory, full of action and incredibly entertaining. How can you not like the lethal  Home Alone-like scene in the house with the ninja kid and the three thieves? Or the two African American martial arts girls fighting the silver spheres with a Nunchaku? This film is full of surprises and is very original. The cinematography is great, the score moody as it should be, and Reggie Banister is so funny as the ""lady's man"".

If you want to have a fun evening on a Saturday night, order a huge pizza, get cold beer, and watch that baby at 10 pm, when it's dark outside.

592651,5,6303204163,"I love all of these Phantasm movies. You'll always have someone say that one sequel is better or worse than others, but I really like them all. What's not to like? I mean, you have Reggie..""Ice-Cream vendor by trade""..who now roams the wastelands in a Hemi Cuda which seems to never run out of gas searching for the evil & elusive Tall Man.  He has enough improvised weapons in the trunk of the Cuda to make the A-Team proud and yet rarely gets shaken down by cops. He gives millions of middle-aged, bald men hope because he always ends up putting the love smackdown on some chick during his travels!  Hell, Reggie's my hero!

592656,5,6303204163,"The third chapter of PHANTASM keeps you off balance. One of the high points of this franchise is the fact that it never gives you exactly what you want, or expect. But it keeps you wanting more, which is what makes this franchise so compelling. If you have been following the series, you will want to see this. If not, don't start with the third film.",1382745600,,351,4.333333333333333
592677,5,6303204163,"I remember Phantasm from yesteryear, and wanted to re-experience it, so we bought all of them for October viewing.

Creepy but well executed speical effects, very strange and eerie set designs, and lots of action cover the landscape of Phantasm 3! The frist one takes a while to get moving, and the 2nd one is cool and gets really cool towards the end. This one is fairly consistent through out the movie. Overall its a good movie and has an excellent soundtrack!",1378684800,,397,4.527777777777778
592679,5,6303204163,This Might Be My Personal Favorite Of The Lot Or Maybe The fourth One. I Think They Keep Getting Better. Would Be Really Sweet If Don Coscarelli Did At Least One More. Tall Man May Just Be The Coolest Villain Ever.,1378684800,,214,4.2439024390243905
592680,3,6303204163,"I love the Phantasm series but Part 4 is better than this (not to mention the excellent original and first sequel). Featuring the worst cast of new characters in a Phantasm film they proceed to dump Le Gros and Irvine in the first few minutes in favor of adding some puppets, zombies and other creatures to the Phantasm world. None of it really works although some mythology is added to the canon when Jody is revealed as an ""alien form."" The special effects shots and sex scene are hilarious though. Has a sex scene in Phantasm ever really worked? We could have seen The Tall Man's planet but no it's the same stuff after The Tall Man lets Mike and Reggie off the hook at the beginning. The balls look terrible and aren't menacing at all. In fact, they are almost friendly. Phantasm III is almost a spoof and isn't scary or unsettling in the least. Just about the only positive thing is that the original Mike and Jody return for this installment. This sequel breaks some of the rules (e.g. adding zombies) so it doesn't work. I would still buy it on Blu-ray in a Phantasm collection but that doesn't seem likely to get released. These are indie films at their finest. Phantasm II got a great BD release though.",1377734400,,1212,4.48868778280543
592681,5,6303204163,"Ahhh the tall man.  My enjoyment of his character knows no limits. I have been terrified of him since i was little and it was reestablished with the new Blu Ray release of number 2.  This is the newer chapter in the book of the tall man, so let's hit it!  This release is actually pretty good and very underrated.  Does it do anything new?  No, not really.  We get revealed just enough new information while leaving enough in question to keep up our thirst.  A lot of people seeing the Blu Ray of 2 might think it isn't worth buying any of the others on DVD.  People would say maybe I grab the first film but the third?!?  The third film is worth it and I will tell you why.  It never feels old and rehashed even though for any logical reason it should.  It plays out like a beautifully done chapter in a book.  They bring back the ""real"" Michael and not a feeble attempt at trickery with a recast.  Although that may seem like no big deal to some, the second film is just not the same without him, even with the great chemistry between James LeGros and Reggie.  Coscarelli does a remarkable job to help us forget the second film's recast while still showing us enough to tie the whole experience together.  Call it creative.  Call it genius but within ten minutes you forget Michael got played by someone else last film.

 This is a widescreen video that's been cleaned up too.  Anchor Bay took some time cleaning the print but it is a shame they didn't go the extra mile and give us an HD transfer or hitting us with deluxe editions like Shout Factory has done.  There's a commentary track which is always great fun with Angus remembering more about each scene than the director or Reggie.  The film itself has a large amount of humor in it.  With the old horn dog Reggie after any woman they meet, another road trip finding the tall man and the ball getting more advanced.  The great thing about these films is how well you can just play them one after another while not getting bored.

How a horror sequel should be done is all right here.  The problem with most of the slasher film sequels is that the original hero is always replaced in the sequels and they think...well the villain is the same so what's the difference if we bring a whole new story in.  For Phantasm it wouldn't work.  You need Reggie and Michael in here and you need that battle between them and the tall man.  The constant struggle.  The characters actually finding more information each sequel and even them questioning ""how can we beat him!""  You need to watch the four films in order one day because that's what the tall man commands!  It's $10 and if you own the first two it is worth it to just buy the third and have a watching party one day with friends.",1365811200,2,2737,4.328740157480315
592682,3,6303204163,its a ok movie and all but the kid in the movie is a bad actor i mean i never seen such bad acting :/ kinda ruined the movie :/ but other then that it was good,1361836800,,159,3.324324324324324
592683,3,6303204163,"The Tall Man has finally gotten his hands on Mike, leaving Reggie to take off on a search and destroy mission with the help of a few unlikely allies! A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury return in PHANTASM 3: LORD OF THE DEAD. Although they receive very little screen time, fans are sure to appreciate the continuity that has been restored from the first film. Coscarelli can't seem to decide where he wants to take the series, so he introduces a few new characters hoping that they will stick to the audience. Rocky, played by Gloria Lynne Henry, is an ex-army martial artist, and as unrealistic as the plot. Henry is awful in the role, and even detracts from the others' performances. Kevin Connors is at least a bit more enjoyable as Tim, the young survivalist, but after accepting him as one of the team, he is dropped entirely from the fourth film. We have a group of thieves that are quickly killed off before returning as zombies for no apparent reason, and we have no further insight in to why the Tall Man shrinks corpses into miniature slaves after three entire films. The one vast improvement is in the special effects department, which return us to the look and feel of the original. It is clear at this point that PHANTASM should have be left as a stand-alone feature.

Secondly, Rocky was cool, she was kung-fu fighting - - -and I think when she was in the hotel with Reggie, she shoulda gone ahead and gave him some, Reggie's kinda sexy to me in a weird way.

He was a customer when I managed a video store in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, this version isn't as good as the first, and has new characters. The second one was passable to watch once, but not anymore, although they probably made money at the Box-Office.

592740,5,6303204163,"Phantasm 3 is one of those movies that has grown on me because of Phantasm and because I want some horror back. I also like the Tall Man and his bladed little buddies, not to mention the creepy little monkeies he has walking around with him. They give me the creeps after the change on 2.

While 3 was really bad in some of the things it did, namely in the kung-fu lady and the match made in whatever, they kind of screw around with who and what we are seeing. We know from bits of 2 and a little of 3 that they take you out of the ground, condense you, and put you to work moving barrels. The brains they keep for the balls and the Tall Man - he is just a scary friend I feel I have always known. That needle and his finger should have never nbeen friends.

He knew my sleep patterns well enough when I was in school anyhow.

These are hard to judge iin some ways because, in my opinion, 2 is the best. 3 connects with that, making good on some more of the blood and the horror and the scary little freaks, not to mention the towns themselves. Personally, I hink pulling into an empty town might make me a little crazy.

I would want out.

Fair warning: USA watched this come out all the time, and a lot of people do not like this. It just fits something in me and I love it. The kid trying to live, Reggie the IceCream Truck 4 barreler; it all comes back. I love it. 4.5/5",1305072000,,1374,4.0

592796,5,6303204163,"In addition to 1994 being the year Sid the Elf began, it also brought the world a third installment of the super b Phantasm series. This is something that couldn't be more appreciated due to the fact it falls into Sid's favorite time period of 90's horror. Any film that can take us back to that great time in life is always welcomed, especially if it's starring the Tall Man. Who mind you has been climbing his way up the list of unstoppable horror icons sitting very close to Myers himself. You just can't help but love this series. The plot is so bizarre and really cater to a certain audience in which we sit front row. C'mon, Joe Bob did this one back on Monstervision during the 90's so what's not to love?

This time we start with a nice flashback breaking down the first two films finer moments. So once up to speed we are brought to current day Mike and Reggie who happen to be a hilarious looking duo. The now adult Mike looks like the adult version of Troy Mcgregor and Reggie still looks like Clint Howard just nearly bald except for a thriving ponytail. Both are still on their mission to bring down the Tall Man, whose still well equipped with an army of zombie elves and skull drilling orbs. Along the way they befriend a young boy (who couldn't be more then 12 and takes down a clan of the most hilarious 90's looking thugs)and a super tough black chick who join the fight. Besides watching Reggie try to get some brown sugar and fail numerous times the rest of the film is the usual fantastic Tall Man action. This one keeps the series alive and leaves you ready for a fourth session.

After watching Phantasm III Sid realized something very interesting. See we make all these jokes about Reggie being a mirror image of Clint Howard, but then realized that his  job before hunting the Tall Man was being an ice cream man. Clint Howard was also an ice cream man, only more deranged, so you can't tell us we're not on to something here. Besides that revelation the movie was a fantastic 90's horror that will remain a new favorite of the list. It's really more of the same old stuff but that's all that it should be. They created such an awesomely B concept that keeps working so there is no need to switch it up. It has everything; Tall Man, killer orbs, zombie elves, Clint Howard stunt double, terrible special effects, explosions, and laughable acting. It's everything we look for. We really enjoyed this one and should have back in the glory days when it was a new release.",1254441600,,2493,4.427015250544662
592797,5,6303204163,"Continuing off ""Phantasm II"", Reggie (Reggie Bannister) has just lost Mike (Michael Baldwin) to that sinister Tall-Man (Angus Scrimm). That evil mortician from another dimension still creates more silver ball sentinels to kill people and of course uses more dead bodies to make dwarf creatures and zombies alike so he can take over as much as the small towns in America as possible then probably the world. It seems Jody (Bill Thornbury) is still alive but wants to be free from becoming a slave of the Tall-Man, now it's up to Reggie with two new pals such as 11 year old Tim (Kevin Conners) and feisty militant woman Rocky (Gloria Lynee Henry) to ward off Tall-Man's minion and discover what his next move is.

Another exciting continuation in the unique Sci-fi horror fantasy saga ""Phantasm"" from writer-director-creator Don Coscrallei. This one gives out some decent performances with more surrealism and creative suprises in store, the gore is aplenty in this installment including the brain-drilling that the evil ball usually does and of course some off-the-wall humor. Some fans are turned off by the humor in this movie but personally i thought it worked quite well and the kid here is probably the coolest young boy in a horror movie for defending himself, i also love how they now added zombies in this besides those evil dwarfs as undead critters. This is another solid winner that is a must see for fans of the horror genre and Phantasm saga.

Anchor Bay choose to use the gorgeous European poster art for the cover of this release and they include a copy of it inside the case with the chapter titles printed on the reverse. This artwork is a huge improvement over the official domestic release art.  My only complaint about this release is that the opening title has somehow been tampered with.  On previous versions after the words PHANTASM III appear, the subtitle of the film, LORD OF THE DEAD emerges on screen under the main title.  This never happens on this release.  It's a very minor complaint but I do wonder what happened there.  This isn't my favorite film of the series but it is still an excellent movie and this DVD release does it justice.

Mike's older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) returns as well, in an unexpected form, to lend a hand too.  Like the above Amazon review states, Phantasm III leaves little to the imagination in terms of gore effects, and the story is nowhere near as cerebral as the original Phantasm, but Phantasm III is still a more than solid sequel in Coscarelli's series.  The overall story becomes expanded and Coscarelli does a great job tying things together using footage from the original film, and despite some plot holes, just about everything works here.

When Reggie enters the mausoleum and is captured by Rocky and Tanesha, the sentinel punctures into Tanesha's forehead. You now see much more blood pouring out of the sentinel, more screaming and a larger puddle of blood on the floor. This scene runs at least 10-15 seconds longer compared to the R rated version. It's funny to see in the R rated version, no blood is seen pouring out of the sentinel. Other than that, I found no other differences between versions. I know 10-15 seconds doesn't sound like much, but being the sentinel scenes are the standout scenes in these films, they're always the ones that get trimmed.

They shoudn't have even made a sequel without James Legros and the girl. Legros is a better Mike then Baldwin will ever be. We saw Baldwin as a kid and that was fine but kicking Legros out for 3 and 4 and putting back Baldwin was a bad move. Finally as much as I loved Reg he dies in number 2 so no continuity and a serious lack of seriousness make 3 and 4 poor poor sequels. In Hellraiser you ever see Pinhead crack a joke with any human characters/victims or do they purpously try to make you laugh no thats why it's a horror!

592859,5,6303204163,"I have to give Phantasm III 5 stars due to the return of two of the original cast members (Jody and Mike).

They introduce some new characters also.

There's a comando type girl.  Reggie is continuously trying to give her some of his vanilla ice cream throughout the movie.

There's also a young boy named Tim who gets left alone in his house when the Tall Man takes out his parents.  This kid makes Macaulay Culkin look like Bambi.

We also find out some very interesting points about the Tall Man:

""His kind are amassing an army to conquer dimensions, worlds unknown.""

When he creates those dwarfs they are left with only a ""vestigial"" part of the cerebral cortex.

We also find out that the Tall Man is susceptible to cold temperatures.  This is based on the scene from Phantasm 1 where he walks by Reggie's ice cream truck.

I did not interpret that particular scene from part 1 that way.  To me it looked like he liked the cold.  But I guess he was really interested in Reggie's ice cream.

There's also some philosophy in this movie.  The Tall Man tells Mike that his ""journey is complete"" and he should ""leave this imperfect flesh construct that ties you to time and space"".

But to me the greatest scene in this movie is the plunger scene.  Towards the end Reggie uses a plunger to capture one of those flying spheres and they they all flush it down the cryogenic tank.

I feel this plunger scene was placed in the movie just for me.  It's like a secret message for me.

There are many secret meanings in the Phantasm movies for those who understand them.

592860,3,6303204163,"The third ""Phantasm"" is trying to be something in between the first and the second one. And yet not succeeding. It lacks thoughtfulness of the first and action of the second. But of course it sticks close to the style of previous ""Phantasms"" because it was also shot by Don Coscarelli. The third part has some new gadgets (meaning spheres), some new people and some new interesting plot innovations. But what I didn't like was this humor which I consider unnecessary. The first two parts were dead serious and only benefited from that. Here there are many scenes which are rather funny and to my opinion it spoils the general mood of the series. As usual here we can notice some flaws (like a four-barrel gun dropped by Reggie in mortuary, which miraculously reappears in the third part), but I guess we can turn the blind eye on that. And finally the budget of this part was rather small comparing to ""Phantasm II"", and it hits the eye (the other one).
So it's not a major disappointment certainly, but I expected much more from this film.

It brought back my favorite actors from 1....plus the sureal element of horror through the eyes of a child. When the directors cut of Phan 2 is released the quartet will have much better continuity.

Also, campy horror was just what was popular at the time. Oblivion was excellent closure for the series that I think most didn't understand. If you look for my Oblivion review you'll see my thoughts on how it was a perfect end to a perfect storyline and an explanation on why I say that.

I'm surprised that tim didn't have a pet dog!, no seriously it seems like this kid would have a pet dog tagging along lol but i digress.

no..no..in all seriousness this series has a great consistency unlike most other horror movie franchises. this flick is more so along the lines of action/horror, with subtle hints of comedy thrown in. its not a strait up horror flick. but make no mistakes its very far from light hearted. the murderous dwarves, and killer spheres make a strong comeback. theres even a special high tech gold one that uses laser beams instead of drill,saws,and spikes. and of course angus is back as the iconic tall man.

the movie picks up right after part to with Reggie and mike recovering from the attack at the end of the second movie. and eventually venturing to a creepy small town called Holtsville (because jody told them too). where they encounter the 2 aforementioned new additions, and some looters who eventually becomes the tall man's minions (if i recall correctly). and of course epic battles ensues. overall a solid addition to the unappreciated, and often forgotten franchise. glad to see its finally on DVD.

This entry has some pretty  jumpy scenes.but they aren't strong enough due to overdone humor. It totally  doesn't suit the Phantasm series. The zombies look like rejects from the  Lucio Fulci zombie film,The Beyond,and have laughably stupid one-liners. Tim  is a 10-  year old kid who carries weapons with him and at one point in the  film uses a revolver to destroy a flying sphere with pin-point  accuracy. This doesn't belong in the Phantasm universe.
However,Phantasm  III has lots of amusing moments. It's great to see Michael Baldwin return as  Michael,and Angus Scrimm is still wonderful as ""The Tall Man"".The  music score is still stunning the gore is very high. The special effects are  terrific too.
Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead is an enjoyable horror  film,but can't live up to the brilliance of the first two films. It's still  worth buying,but you have to be a bit ""hardcore"" on Phantasm to  REALLY like it.
I wanted to give it four and a half stars,but a regualr  four star rating seems a little too high,as in my book that means  ""nearly perfect"" and Phantasm III is no where near perfect. It's  still very good though.",965952000,3,1319,4.756637168141593

Phantasm III is a pretty good entry in the series, but it doesn't quite match the tones and scares of the first two philms. The music is once again excellent,the gore is plentiful and the  special F/X are neat. Reggie uses his quad-barreled shotgun even more than  in Part 2 and it sure is great to see Michael Baldwin return! However,it  does have it's share of rough spots. It is very humorous in  parts and may  turn off hardcore phans. Some scary scenes,but the humor is much too over  the top. It's quite sad that the dwarves are only in one scene and are  replaced with a zombie gang with laughably bad one-liners. It's also quite  disappointing that Liz from Part 2 dies at the begiining (I didn't care  much for her,but still). But the philm is very entertaining and the gold  sphere from Part 2 returns and is even deadlier. Overall,if you a true  phan,go check it out. It's no where near the brilliance of the phirst  two,but it's still pretty cool. Rated R phor gruesome violence,some language  and brief nudity.",960508800,2,1055,4.60752688172043
592912,4,6303204163,"I have long desired to see the 'Phantasm' films; mixtures of surrealism and horror being what I love. However, the well-known graphic violence kept me at a distance until Phantasm 3 appeared on cable.  At midnight.  So, I  took a gamble and watched it.  Phantasm 3 is excellent.  Though slightly  hokey and not as powerful as the original, Phantasm 3 still is very  powerful.  The world in which Mike and Reggie is like some post-apocalyptic  nightmare; with the Tall Man, that interloper between life and death, roams  America stealing souls. There are several scene which are masterworks.  The  first being Mike waking up in the hospital and finding himself face to face  with the demon nurse.  The best scene however, is the ending. Reggie held  captive by hundreds of the drills, and the zombies pulling the boy through  the window. ""Its never over, boy!""  (This is said to be a horror  comedy, but viewers beware: after seeing this I looked under the bed for  the first time in my life. For a horror comedy, try ""The Evil Dead'.  For my favorite film, try 'Eraserhead'.",950486400,6,1074,4.733695652173913

7840680,3,6303204163,"Somehow yet more incomprehensible than its predecessors, this is the first in the series I wouldnt recommend outside of seeing the whole series in order.  Just imagine everything you liked form parts 1-2, and now imagine that theres less of it.

HOW DID WE GET HERE? This franchise is just plain bonkers, and the story is all over the place with no real explanations in sight.  Parts 1 and 2 ended in inexplicable nightmare-like twists a la A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), leaving us at the end of part 2 with Reggie (Reggie Bannister; Phantasm 1-5, Wishmaster) apparently dead at the side of the road, and Mike (A. Michael Baldwin; Phantasm 1-5) and Liz (Paula Irvine; Phantasm III) being driven to their doom by the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm; Phantasm 1-5, Subspecies, Wishmaster), who had melted to death not long before.  Our part 3 opening reveals (ever so vaguely) how, indeed, the thought-to-be-dead Tall Man got to them in the end.  Then an evil dwarf eats Liz face, taking care of someone who apparently isn't needed to further to plot in this next sequel.

After the car crash (with Mike, Liz and the Tall Man at the end of part 2), Reggie checks on Mike at the hospital to find an evil-sphere-possessed nurse trying to kill him!  The magical orb literally took the place of her brain, thus evolving the capabilities of these entities in the franchise.  Thats certainly new! So why not do that all the time and just assassinate the protagonists?  Mike ends up dying and, contrary to his from-the-dead brother Jodys (Bill Thornbury; Phantasm 1-5) advice, he goes into the light.  But why would he do that? The ghost of his brother was right there telling him to do otherwise!  Parts 1-2 were admittedly weird, and a lot went unexplained.  Be prepared to be baffled.

Much to my dismay, this sequel adopts a 90s bad movie vibe (a la Leprechaun), complete with douchebag criminal bad guys and a tough little survivor kid with a razorblade frisbee.  Now in the form of a metal sphere, Jodys spirit guides Reggie and the kid to the Tall Man.  I know, you're thinking I mustve left something out because this makes no sense for Jody to have been a ghost and then a killer sphere. Bad news. Ive told you everything. This just doesnt make sense.

On their journey, they join forces with the nunchuck-twirling Rocky (Gloria Lynne Henry; The Devils Advocate, Phantasm: Ravager), Reggie somehow becomes a sleaze ball, and another silly sex scene transpiresIm beginning to think this is a running joke between Reggie and Coscarelli.

Speaking of jokes, this sequel is doing very little service or justice to the franchise in that it is just incomprehensibly silly.  People are doing things in dreams that affect reality, the Tall Mans severed body parts continue to become ridiculous monsters (as in part 1) for no reason, Jody keeps switching from being a sphere to a specter to a dream to a sphere, portals just seem to appear and disappear as needed, andoh, right, the really stupid douchebag criminal zombie fights comprise much of the action. Its become pretty campy.

Despite all this silliness, we do get some answers.  We develop the Phantasm mythology by explaining how the Tall Man seems to continue returning from the dead, Mikes strange connection to the Tall Man is elaborated, what powers the murderous spheres is revealed, some of the things done to create his evil dwarves are shown, and some additional aspects of the Tall Mans grand plan are exposed.  We don't really understand the ins and outs of any of this, but at least we know more.  And, despite all that isn't answered, it felt good to learn more about whats going on with this interdimensional graverobbing scheme totake over the world?  Or at least, the Pacific Northwest?

Writer/director Don Coscarelli (Phantasm 1-4, The Beastmaster, Bubba Ho-Tep) continues to make sequels that hardly tie together, yet always manage to pick up right where the former ends.  Evidently, some duct tape and rewrites go a long way.  This is both admirable and a tad crazy, especially given the gaps between these movies (1979, 1988, 1994) and how he maintains the same lead cast.  Much to the films detriment, the Tall Man seems less menacing and less impressive here, as do his dwarves and balls.  Again, we have violently swerved into bad movie territory, so the suspense has been largely replaced by giggles as if to ask is this really serious right now?  You also may recall that psychic powers were prominent in Phantasm II (1988), and that Mike had a connection of sorts to the Tall Man. Now Jody shares other-worldly links to both Mike and the Tall Man. So, while this isn't actually new, its already starting to feel old.

You cant discuss these movies without mentioning the balls.  The effects were pretty solid, with the murderous chrome spheres flying through the air, unsheathing blades and buzz saws, impaling victims, and drilling into their heads!  The gore is decent, but more toned down from parts 1-2 (which were served better by their budgets). The balls appear markedly more CGI than before, when they were definitely rotoscoped in parts 1-2.  The gore overall was less satisfying than previous installments, along with most aspects of this sequel.

Parts 1-2 worked because of the satisfyingly unusual story.  Thats gone.  The series also thrived on the relevance of the Tall Man.  Thats diminished.  It now relies on its mythology which, despite building somewhat, isn't satisfying enough to save this movie.  Its the first in the series I wouldnt recommend outside of seeing the whole series in order.  Like parts 1-2, the surprise ending is pretty random and feels like Reggie, Mike and the kid are doomed.  Im curious to see where this goes in part 4.",1497225600,,5736,4.812244897959184
