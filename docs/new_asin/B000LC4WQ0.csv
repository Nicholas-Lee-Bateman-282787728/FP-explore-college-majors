8160845,5,B000LC4WQ0,"Extremely well acted and a very non-sensational look at Inner City problems in New York City.  Director Baxter and Writer Riccardi also make us look hard at Social Status issues in a country that claims to be very democratic.  Yet, without a doubt, it is a ""coming of age film"" very much in the style of ""Moonlight.""  Also, one of the best performances of Quentin Crisp.",1508457600,,370,4.575757575757576
