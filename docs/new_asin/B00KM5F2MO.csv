6433573,5,B00KM5F2MO,I was fortunate enough to see this movie at its limited release grand debut and must admit that I did NOT sleep through any of it---which says a whole lot about the show.  The story is easy to follow as it takes you through time while it builds a believable story of matching the living with the plight of the undead in the old west setting.  Kudos to the Preacher and the Marshall as well as other cast members and the Director for their accomplishments in this independent film.,1406937600,5,480,4.382022471910112
6433574,4,B00KM5F2MO,"This is a very high quality indy film about zombies in the wild west. You wouldn't expect as much story or as much attention to detail coming from such a small film. Not a gore fest, but a real movie about what people do in bad situations.",1406246400,9,239,4.1063829787234045
6433575,3,B00KM5F2MO,"I was hoping for awesome and this it wasn't. Its an indie film. The idea is amazing. The story was weak. The acting was average. The sound.. terrible. Cinematography... glimpse of good.. but mostly just average. Based on the trailer, I feel I was let down. If I hadn't seen the trailer, I think I would have enjoyed this more.",1424390400,,326,4.45
6433576,3,B00KM5F2MO,"Another Zombie movie with a slightly different tinge to it.
The movie centers around a minister and a new found friend in the local sheriff.
When this outbreak begins, the minister feels compelled to pray for the zombies whom he has to kill in order to survive.
While this is a quasi humorous blurb to the story, the minister also buries them, hoping for a better end to their already misfortune
in life. The duo end up in a strange ""military"" style camp, awaiting to leave for better parts, the sheriff sacrifices himself to let the
semi bewildered minister reach the city where he believes help awaits. There is no real ending to this story, other than the minister
is on his own, no closure to this story, and definitely leaves the viewer hanging.",1418428800,,750,4.604477611940299
6433577,3,B00KM5F2MO,"Amid the virtual avalanche of low-budget zombie-horror films, Revelation Trail is really not a bad watch!  Although there are segments that seem to drag on unnecessarily, plus some of the acting was a bit too stiff, the action sequences were fairly well-choreographed; resisting the use of CGI effects except for possibly the kill shots, the makeup folks did a respectable job on the undead.  Rather than use female nudity to spice things up as was done in the inferior Dead and the Damned movie, the filmmakers here featured conflicts among characters and twists of fate to maintain viewer interest.  The ending video collage was very nicely stitched together.  Worth a look for fans of the zombie genre!",1417737600,,705,5.0

6433580,4,B00KM5F2MO,"I went into this with my interest piqued from a few different angles: as a fan of TRUE independent film, as a fan of westerns, and due to the fact that I'll watch just about anything that has zombies in it (one of my shortlist guilty pleasure genre elements which will always beg me to at least give something a chance, however fleeting). I'd followed the development of this film for some time after hearing about it, and its long road through production, through its Kickstarter campaign and online progress updates. I was pleased to discover that Revelation Trail not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. I'm genuinely impressed with the fact that John Gibson has not only created a great ""first"" film, or a great ""indie"" film, but just a ""great film."" Period. Revelation Trail is often breathtaking. An inspired and heartfelt bit of cinema in which you can see the love, talent, and dedication that was put into it within each and every frame. It's not wholly a zombie movie. It's not even strictly a western. Yeah, it's a western that happens to have zombies in it - which is an awesome combination in its own right which is executed splendidly on those merits alone. But more than that, it's a thoughtful, introspective character-driven period piece that deals with some of the darker, conflicting aspects of existence, and is a rather apt commentary on the human condition and how people respond to loss, desperation, and ultimately, the finality of clinging to survival against all odds. A great script. Clever direction. Lush cinematography. Tight editing (overall). Some stellar performances. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But few films are. There are times where the limited budget causes the film to show its seams (sometimes more glaringly so than others). But there are several moments to counter this, where the ambition of the set pieces impress in what they were able to do with so little. Some performances stumble here and there, though Daniel Van Thomas and Robert Valentine hands down ran away with the MVP awards for me, and deserve special mention. Daniel Britt is also very good, I just was particularly impressed with Van Thomas and Valentine. The sound design, while adequate, was oftentimes lackluster and softened the impact of several scenes, either through flat/cheap sound effects that lacked dimensionality, or overly abundant ADR that didn't feel wholly integrated into the scene. But again: super microbudget indie film. The makeup FX were rather excellent. The digital effects - hit or miss. Some of the digital blood/elements worked really well. Some called too much attention to themselves. But they never really hurt/hindered the scene, or the film as a whole. As I said, the script is really intriguing, and the editing overall is solid. Though, there are moments where the pacing feels a bit off, particularly in the transitions between acts 1-2 and 2-3. By no means a deal-breaker, but some sequences feel a bit abbreviated, and others could've been tightened somewhat for impact (particularly the montages). Gibson's direction is astute, effectively combining the visual tonality and overall aesthetic of the genres he's blending. The characters are rich and relatable, the dialogue is oftentimes clever. Don't go in expecting a hyperviolent action spectacle, because you'll probably be disappointed. Much like The Walking Dead, this is much more eloquent character drama than mindless genre fare. And I'd suggest disregarding the DVD's cover art, which make it look like a campy, cheap-and-quick B-movie pulled from the depths of bargain bins and late night cable. This aspires to be something greater. And in my opinion, succeeds (translation: the promo art is marketing the wrong movie, a bad one, instead of the one included on the disc, which is a good one). I'd strongly suggest nabbing a copy of Revelation Trail ASAP. It's an exciting, thrilling, witty, and heartfelt telling of a story that, while set in days of old, is quite timeless. And it's entertaining as hell. I loved it.",1415145600,6,4042,5.034328358208955
6433581,4,B00KM5F2MO,"This is a very good indie film. It's not the best at anything, but it's solid in what it does and respects the conventions of both westerns and zombie films.

The way it's filmed is close, gritty, and organic, bringing you right into the action or emotion onscreen. The story is driven by characters who are very real and have well-developed arcs. The story addresses compelling and interesting concepts, showing depth and heart in a genre that isn't really expected to have it. The time period doesn't betray itself for the sake of keeping with the times--we know as much about the zombies as the characters do.

That being said, it is an indie film, and it never loses that feel. The editing with desaturation, use of isolated color and depth of field work in favor of the (relatively) artistic experience. However, there are some soft shots where nothing is in focus, moments where it's obvious the line was recorded in ADR, lines from one-line extras that weren't delivered convincingly, or special effects  executed in a way that could break the suspension of disbelief for some observant viewers. Much of the film makes use of episodic plot points to progress the story, and consistent pacing doesn't lock in until the end section of the story. But the ending is where all the good stuff is (in my opinion), including a glaring possibility for a sequel.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombies, westerns, indie films, or good, solid stories.",1414627200,6,1459,4.800796812749004
6433582,5,B00KM5F2MO,"Great story and film.  This film was a pleasant surprise.  Great zombie kills and loved the idea of a western zombie movie.  If you love The Walking Dead, you'll like this too.",1414627200,,176,4.4375
6433583,5,B00KM5F2MO,"Disclaimer upfront: I pledged money for this film when it was on Kickstarter. That said, I was amazed at the superb quality of acting, special effects, wardrobe, dialogue, and settings for such a small amount of money to work with. The entire cast and crew put everything they had into making this movie which you can see on one of the many bonuses added to the DVD, including the alternate commentary and bloopers or ""Revelation Fails"" as they're called.
I won't get a spoilerly here but the dead somehow come back to life and want to eat people. The Preacher and the Marshall get out of town and sharpen their zombie killing skills. It's not all about these two men though so I'll stop with the story details and let you enjoy it yourself.
This is a movie you watch twice, if not more. The first viewing is to watch, see the characters, and how it all plays out. The second viewing, since you know what happens, lets you focus on the characters, dialogue, settings, zombies, etc. and see how it's a great Western period piece, 1882, and a Zombie thriller.
Don't be fooled by the low Amazon price. You'll think you're stealing a big budget Hollywood film which this can compete with any day.",1414627200,2,1192,4.5488372093023255

The disk itself was in excellent condition, no scratches or faults. The case was in excellent shape, holding the DVD in place securely. I have seen this film when it was launched in Paducah, KY. I was so happy to get to see the behind-the-scenes and extras. It was wonderful to see such an amazing piece of art put together by nearly every person I befriended in college. And, as I sat and watched the film for the second time, I still found myself marveling at the special effects, the plot, underlying tales given by the imagery, and the story of a holy man trying to make sense of his world as it changes around him. I sincerely hope that there will be a sequel. A wonderful blending of a Western and a zombie movie.",1410220800,4,836,4.365384615384615

8659880,4,B00KM5F2MO,"""Revelations Trail"" in many ways is a classic Western. The plot focuses on one man and his partner, traveling on the frontier. There is a deliberate pace to the plot. In other words, don't expect any ""whiz bang"" action. Situations happen and the traveling cowboys (or in this case a preacher and lawman) handle the problems. Along the way, they discover who they are and what they are capable of.

In this case the situation involves zombies. The makeup is A-plus. The action is well paced and the camera angles are wisely staged. The director/location scouts made good use of terrain. The actors are pretty steady.

I most definitely recommend this DVD/movie to the horror fan looking for a zombie film *not* set in the modern era, or the western fan looking for something a little different.",1469318400,2,793,4.781021897810219
