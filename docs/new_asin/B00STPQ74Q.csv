6992289,5,B00STPQ74Q,"I loved the prelims on both cards. Cards had some really good knockouts. Jones vs cormier was a great war. Lawler Hendricks was pretty good. Overall a great deal. I hope the ufc keeps the combo DVDs as the ppvs have gotten watered down, I'd be much more likely to buy more often.",1428710400,4,279,4.283018867924528

8699204,4,B00STPQ74Q,The main reason to get this is for the Jones Vs. Cormier title bout.  The lead up to that was cray cray.  And their particular card is stacked with good fights.  I remember feeling frightened for Josh Burkman as he faced the Cuban man-monster of Hector Lombard.  Burkman has got MAD HEART!  The UFC 181 was bleh in comparison.  Great price for two UFC events though.  They split them up over 3 DVDs.  The main cards for each event get 1 DVD each and then all the pre-lims for both events get stacked together on a third disc.,1524873600,,525,4.285714285714286

8699209,5,B00STPQ74Q,I like the format of two numbered ufcs in one.  It does make them cheaper in the long run.  I am almost done with them from 1 to present.,1439251200,,137,3.689655172413793

8699211,2,B00STPQ74Q,"Both shows are weak with long 5 round main events with minimal action.

Jones v DC was basically just a remake of Jones v evans, a lot of build up and hate, but when time came to unload that animosity they just danced around avoiding the fight.

Giblert is at the end of his career. He's showing the miles when he cant even defend a guillotine choke or win all 3 rounds against Diego, or at least not get dropped by Diego.

Not sure why I'm giving it 2 stars, I must just be in a good mood today.",1436054400,,496,3.98989898989899
8699212,5,B00STPQ74Q,"UFC 181 is one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET.

The fight between Johny Hendricks and Robbile Lawler is one of the greatest that Ive ever seen. It's also the best UFC fight of 2014.
 It makes this combo DVD worth 5 stars.

 The ending was a big surprise to me. Johnys take down techniques were much superior. He took down Robbie multiple times.
Robbie almost lost this fight. Then in the last minutes he won. Its unbelievable.

Tony Ferguson vs Abel Trujillo

Its exciting . Both fighters attacked from the beginning till the end. It ended in round 1 with a choke hold.

Todd duffee vs Anthony Hamilton
The fight was won by a knockout at 33 seconds of round 1.

Travis Browne vs Brendan Schaub

It ended in round 1. Its good but its too short.

Anthony Pettis vs Gilbert Melendez

Its very interesting. The guy who was hard pressed from the beginning till the end won by a choke. It ended in round 2.

Theres ONLY ONE ENTERTAINING FIGHT in UFC 182. It makes  this show worth 4 stars.

Daniel Cormier vs Jon Jones
Its the best fight of this show. Daniel did his best but Jon much longer reach made its hard for Daniel to effectively attack Jon. I give this show 4 stars because of this fight.

Kyoji Horiguchi vs Louis Gaudinot
Both were very quick with their fists and kicks but they missed most of the time. Even after round 3 ended, none had clear advantage over the other.

Myles Jury vs Donald Cerrone
Donald was much stronger and technically better but he could not finish off his opponents.

The 2 remaining fights were worse.

Brad Tavares vs Nate Marquardt
This fight was lukewarm

Hector Lombard vs Josh Burkman
Its a lopsided fight. Lombard was much strong and possessed better techniques.",1432512000,2,1702,4.449838187702265
