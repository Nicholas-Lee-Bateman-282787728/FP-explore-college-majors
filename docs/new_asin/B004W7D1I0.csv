8444587,5,B004W7D1I0,"Michael Casswell really knows how to get this stuff across.  This isn't for beginners, for sure.  I just slowed the DVD down a bit, in places, and really learned a lot.  There's nothing out there like this, at least not teaching the Peter Green technique.....and songs.  Can't say enough good things about it.  If you love Peter Green, and want to learn his songs,step by step, and all the little nuances, this is the DVD for you....I'm so glad that I purchased it.",1386979200,3,465,4.554216867469879
