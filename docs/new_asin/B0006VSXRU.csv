8453800,5,B0006VSXRU,It's been years since I seen this movie and I still love it! They don't make movies like this anymore. It should be released on DVD! I got a great VHS copy for a great price. Of course the day after getting my copy and watching it again for the first time in 30yrs I would actually found a copy at a local thrift store for 60cents! lol So now I have 2 copies! But that's OK because if something ever happens to one copy I'll have a backup! If your a Tony Geary or Billy Dee Williams fan this movie is a must have!,1425081600,,513,3.895238095238095
