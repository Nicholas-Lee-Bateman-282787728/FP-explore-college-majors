3778142,3,B001RPZDW2,"Ponchielli's irresistible amalgam of French grand opera, middle Verdi, and verismo pre-echoes has a long, starry history on records. Whatever your favorite LP or CD recording may be (Arangi-Lombardi, Callas I or II, Cerquetti, Tebaldi, Caball, Urmana, et cetera), the audio portion of this 1986 video from the Vienna State Opera will not displace it. Its principal competition on DVD is a 2005 performance from the Liceu in Barcelona starring Deborah Voigt, and the two together have some complementary value. They allow us to see different approaches to staging an opera that always has been difficult to cast satisfactorily, and is given more rarely now than 50 years ago. Both have a few big names in the cast among lesser lights, and are worth seeing and hearing. Neither provides GIOCONDA with the first-rate representation that many operas, important and unimportant, have received on DVD.

Filippo Sanjust directed and designed Vienna's traditional production, and in his handsome sets and tableaux there is an unmistakable influence of 19th-century paintings. This is grand, pictorial work, in front of which there is a good amount of old-fashioned standing and delivering, though as noted below, some cast members make an effort at delineating their characters. Close-ups tend to dwell on choristers who, no matter what they are wearing, look as authentically Venetian as a Spritzkuchen. The '05 Barcelona DVD, production by Pier Luigi Pizzi, goes for cleaner lines and a sparer, less ornate and  realistic visual representation.

The Viennese orchestra has played better, and *usually* plays better, than it does here under conductor Adam Fischer. He brings some atmosphere to Ponchielli's excellent prelude, which is so similar to that of Verdi's ADA in the way it sets two important themes (Rosary/Barnaba, Ada/Priests) in opposition to one another, the brutal one seeming to overwhelm the gentler one before an ethereal reprise -- essentially giving us the story of the opera in miniature. On the debit side, the strings at the very opening are out of tune, and this proves symptomatic throughout the evening; this is not shipshape or, one senses, highly motivated work. To his credit, Fischer is considerate of his cast, understanding of ways in which he can accommodate and minimize vocal weaknesses.

The outstanding performance on stage is that of baritone Matteo Manuguerra, who by this point was getting long in the tooth (he was over 60) but had an iron grasp of his musical, stylistic and histrionic responsibilities as Barnaba. He plays to the hilt librettist Arrigo Boito's Satanic villain (a pre-Iago, right down to the instigation of An Act I choral riot that the heroic tenor must silence with a ringing high note). Plcido Domingo, recovering from hernia surgery at the time, is professional and diligent as usual, though not in best voice. High notes of Enzo's aria are clearly tracked in from another source, and the demanding tessitura of the duet with Barnaba results in some gusty, edgy singing. I often prefer Domingo at 75 percent to someone else at 100, and that is the case here -- he still has a suavity and finish beyond Richard Margison on the rival DVD, and his basic tone is more glamorous and arresting. The weak link on the male side is then-young house bass Kurt Rydl's Alvise, who in every way seems on foreign terrain. This is not a grateful part, and he fills it, no more.

Both Eva Marton (Gioconda) and house mezzo Ludmila Semtschuk (Laura) seem to have decided that ""loud"" was the new ""exciting""...or perhaps in opera, this notion was anything but new. Either because they could not do so or were not inclined to, they do not observe many of Ponchielli's dynamic markings. They have worthy instruments and they supply some thrills, cheap and otherwise, but variety and color are sacrificed. Semtschuk is a good-looking woman who carries herself elegantly on stage; Marton gives the sort of serious, stern performance one also sees in her Kostelnika, Elektra, Dyer's Wife, and Turandot. ""Suicidio!"" gets a big hand. Margarita Lilowa, the Cieca, is no contralto (Ewa Podle on the '05 Barcelona DVD is). If she is a Cieca of the ""second Laura faking depth"" variety, a frequent casting recourse, she nevertheless gives an affecting performance. More than anyone else on stage, she brings a human grounding to these proceedings, to their great benefit, singing and acting her small part with tenderness and dignity. Her terror at the assault (verbal and physical) of her unseen accusers in Act I is very convincing.

Gerlinde Dill's choreography for the Dance of the Hours creatively dramatizes the triangle of Enzo/Laura/Alvise, complete with brutal denouement. As on the rival DVD, the ballet is one of the highlights, although the Barcelona performance takes a less plot-specific, more erotically charged option. Hugo Kch's sophisticated video direction is a major plus for Vienna; he even gives us composite images (close-up of tearful Gioconda on one side, distant shot of praying chorus on the other, at the end of Act One).

Which to buy, '86 Vienna or '05 Barcelona? I cannot enthusiastically get behind either, but I cannot advise against either. Neither stage production is adventurous: Vienna is old-fashioned good taste, while Barcelona is modern-minimalist good taste. There is not a great performance among the four singers making up the Gioconda/Enzo duos, but no one is ruinous either. Vienna has much the better Barnaba, marginally the better Laura; Barcelona wins for Alvise. Both Ciecas are very good (Lilowa for her acting, the hammier Podle for her truly remarkable voice). Perhaps the better sound and picture of the newer Barcelona tip the scales slightly in its favor.",1374796800,8,5736,5.121794871794871
3778143,5,B001RPZDW2,"First off, I must admit: I am an avid fan of LA GIOCONDA; in fact, I have five recordings of it and never tire of hearing the music.  When I saw this DVD was available, I jumped at the chance to buy it and I am  SO GLAD I did!  It is well worth the price.  The singing of each of the solo voices is excellent.  Except for one missing high note, the singing of Eva Marton is spectacular as is the remainder of the cast.  Well worth purchasing.  Even though it is an older DVD, it is still terrific!

3778145,5,B001RPZDW2,"The fact that there are only two other reviews of this opera, even though the DVD was recorded in l986, supports my contention that it is a neglected masterpiece. Perhaps it is because it calls for  such great resources; vocal - - it needs six strong singers in the featured roles; and technical - - everything from ballets, to processions to burning ships. That's why having such a performance on a well recorded DVD is such a luxury. For those unfamiliar with the opera, along with Ponchielli's music, we have a libretto by Arrigo Boito - - a long-time collaborator with Verdi - -based on a story after Victor Hugo. It is really what Grand Opera is all about: witches, poisons, vendettas, unrequited love,  Venetian carnivals, etc. The famous Waltz of the Hours becomes even more intriguing since the choreographer, Gerlinde Dill, integrates it into the rivalry between Enzo (brilliantly sung by Domingo - - his rendition of Cielo e mar is spot on)- -and the sinister Alvisa ( Kurt Rydl). Eva Marton  La Gioconda is particularly effective in the last act with her suicidio aria. This is one of those DVD's I would recommend if you could only take a few operas with you on that desert island.",1356307200,15,1193,4.698564593301436
3778146,5,B001RPZDW2,"It is sometimes difficult to present a standard repertoire item in a fashion which will bring out hidden beauties, but this production manages to do this especially with the translation option which brings out
information which is not readily apparent. Case in point: At the conclusion of the opera La Gioconda stabs and kills herself to prevent Barnabas from satisfying himself. As she is lying dead, Barnabas screams in her ear, ""I drowned your mother because she was bothering me!"". This ties up a loose end in Act 4 where La Gioconda was looking for her mother(La Cieca). The cast and scenery is traditional and engaging.",1258243200,11,625,4.90566037735849
3778147,5,B001RPZDW2,"This is, of course, not a new release, but a reissue from Image, a company that has deleted (or lost the license) their operatic catalogue. In one sense it is a historical document coming from the mid 80's. A conventional production it is nonetheless eminently satisfactory. For an opera that is so quintessentially Italian, it is ironic that not only does it emmanate from Vienna, there isn't an Italian in the cast. Even so, the singing is full-blooded, healthy, and robust. It surely is the best document for Marton. She is even able to scale her voice down for the hairpin turns in the last act. She is not, alas, able to produce a piano B flat (the famous Milanov note) in the first act, but then neither could Callas or Tebaldi. Domingo is splendid as is the underrated and underrecoded baritone Matteo Managuerra. The Laura is a Russian; she tends to be somewhat generic is a role that cries out for a Barbiere or Simionato. Nevertheless she is never less than satisfactory. Kurt Rydl as Alvise is somewhat outside of his fach, and is perhaps the least satisfactory of the principals, but it is hardly his fault that he was born in a German speaking country rather than Italy. La Cieca is sung by a house stalwart, Margarita Lilowa. This is the one piece of casting where the Liceo trumps this performance: they were lucky enough to have Eva Podlesh, probably the last remaining contralto. There is a clip of Voce di donna on YouTube.

Other DVD's have such serious short comings that they simply are not in the running, notably the performance from Verona with Andrea Gruber. If you are a Voigt fan and can deal with the short comings of Margison this performance can be a contender.

Essentially this performance does not enshrine any truly weak point and overall yields a great deal of satisfaction.

Highly recommended.",1241827200,39,1830,4.7125

8338603,3,B001RPZDW2,"La Gioconda contains some beautiful music.  However, as has long been remarked by others, the libretto is an embarrassment and the plot is beyond ridiculous.  Much of the blame for the libretto must accrue to the librettist, Arrigo Boito.  It is surprising that Boito is the same person who wrote the wonderful librettos for Verdi's ""Otello"" and ""Falstaff.""  However, in these two operas he was working from Shakespeare's great plays and we know that Verdi played a critical role in the development of the librettos.  Amilcare Ponchielli's score has some sublime moments.  La Cieca's Act I aria ""Voce di donna, o d'angelo"" is always most moving.  Enzo's famous ""Cielo e mar"" is an operatic treat when sung properly.

There are too the wonderful love duet between Enzo and Laura in Act II ""Laggiu, nelle nebbie remote"" and the Act II duet between Gioconda and Laura ""L'amo come il fulgor del creato"" is the most dramatic number in the score.  Gioconda's dramatic soliloquy in Act IV ""Suicidio! .........in questi fieri momenti tu sol mi resti"" is an aria every opera lover knows and waits for.  I've never attended a performance of La Gioconda, but after watching this DVD recorded at the Vienna State Opera in 1986 I have to conclude that in some ways the opera is easier to appreciate and love in audio alone.

The video quality of the DVD is very good for a 1986 recording.  However, I found the audio to be somewhat disappointing.  The sound is often muffled.  Another problem is that the sound volume rises and falls sometimes as the characters move about the stage owing presumably to improper placement of microphones.  I therefore found myself often adjusting the sound volume.  The sets are fairly good, but they often have a rather flat painted look that we associate with operas produced during the 1950s.  The costumes especially in Act III are excellent.

Eva Marton delivers an excellent performance as Gioconda and her final act ""Suicidio"" received a well-deserved prolonged ovation from the otherwise rather subdued Vienna audience.  Margarita Lilowa as La Cieca delivers a truly moving performance particularly in Act I and I thought that she was the only cast member who was totally convincing in her role.  Ludmila Semtschuk is a beautiful and elegant Laura and her singing is competent; yet she always looks uneasy and somewhat out of place.

Matteo Manuguerra as Barnaba presents his character as one of opera's great villains and he foreshadows the more subtle and nuanced role of Iago in Verdi's ""Otello.""  His fisherman's ballad ""Ah! Pescator affonda l'esca"" in Act II is beautifully sung.  I have always been a great fan of Placido Domingo.  However, I did not enjoy him much as Enzo in this production.  Although he always has a great stage presence, he often looked clumsy and uncomfortable in this role and his rendition of ""Cielo e mar"" seemed rather flat to me.

For me the highlight of this production was Act III in which we see the great hall in Alvise's house where the beautifully costumed guests are enjoying a festive occasion.  The ballet ""The Dance of the Hours"" is exquisitely performed and is a delight to watch.  There probably is no ballet in all of opera, including the French Grand Opera, that is as good as this.  The chorus is excellent.

In conclusion, I'm pleased that I watched this DVD.  I do not know whether my problems with this performance were due solely to the intrinsic defects of Boito's libretto or the bizarre story line.  It might not be possible to mount a better and more believable production.  However, one wonders too whether a great opera director, such as Sir David McVicar, might not be able to do something with this opera that would make a staged production worthy of the often wonderful music of Amilcare Ponchielli, as McVicar did recently with great success in a Blu-ray presentation of another problematic opera, Cilea's ""Adriana Lecouvreur.""",1415404800,3,3917,4.886363636363637
