8498659,3,B006ICK9MI,"The video is 70% English 30% Spanish.
The songs are catchy, but I wish there was more Spanish involved. I think ""Como te llamas"" is the song that shows more Spanish than any song in this DVD. However kids LOVE IT! My preschoolers really liked the songs.",1377129600,,253,4.404255319148936
8498660,5,B006ICK9MI,"As a parent with three young children I have watched a fair amount (OK, too many!) of DVD's for kids and Rosie and Andy is one of the very best I have ever come across.  I appreciate how it is entertaining in its own right for younger kids who could simply watch the children sing and dance and enjoy the catchy songs while it truly can be a meaningful language lesson for an older child by them singing along with the bilingual songs and making the connections between the English and Spanish lyrics.  The production values are excellent, the songs are memorable and fun, and the emphasis on family is one that many people can connect with.  Hope there's a volume two on the way.",1327017600,,680,4.424

The videos are colorful and fun to watch and the songs are very catchy and easy to learn.  In fact, my students have been singing the songs all week!  Here are a few comments from my students: ""My favorite video was `When Family Comes to See You', it reminds me about my family, too!""  ""Rosie & Andy are good singers!""  ""I learned more Spanish and new words!""  ""What I like about the DVD is that the songs got stuck in my head.  I want to put this on my iPod!""  My students and I really enjoyed watching Rosie & Andy and all of their friends.  We can't wait to see more!!!",1326758400,,675,4.045454545454546
8498662,5,B006ICK9MI,What a great idea!  Both my kids love the DVD and are anxious for the music to come on CD!  The songs are fun and the kids love to sing and move to the music with Rosie and Andy!  A definite must have for those wanting their kids to learn some Spanish basics in a fun and entertaining way!,1326326400,,289,3.864406779661017
8498663,5,B006ICK9MI,"My kids absolutley love these videos!  They sing the songs all the time.  The videos are bright and fun to watch, and the songs are a great learning tool to introduce Spanish.  Thank you Rosie & Andy.",1326067200,,200,4.351351351351352
