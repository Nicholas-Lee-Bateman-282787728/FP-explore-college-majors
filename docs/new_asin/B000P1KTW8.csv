2807201,3,B000P1KTW8,"Hi,
well, I allready had the DVD of this fantastic concert. It's brilliant: Bruce Springsteen and the Seeger Sessions Band; completely new interpretations of old songs. Great! This is a really must-have-disc.. BUT!!
This blu-ray is not worth. The video is unsharp, it seems that they just took the dvd and scaled it from 720 pixel to 1920 pixel. The sound is also ok, but it could be better for a blu-ray, sometimes you don't here some instruments you can cleary see.
That's sad, because I have some other concert blu-rays which are clearly sharp, with fantastic colours.

So, just take the DVD, that should work also and is much cheaper.",1232150400,2,638,4.747747747747748
2807202,5,B000P1KTW8,"Being a long time fan of the Boss, I had to get this BluRay for my collection.

The songlist leaves a little to wish for, but it's definitely acceptable. The technical quality of the disk is amazing, it absolutely blew me away with awesome audio and great video - a must have for any Boss fan.

Of course it's not like being at the real deal (only been to 4 of his concerts, although none in the US), but it provides a nice dose of a near-concert feeling.

Highly recommended.",1231545600,,476,4.266666666666667
2807203,5,B000P1KTW8,"If anything, this shows how much fun making music can be. What a great atmosphere. Wish I would have been there. Once more, Bruce shows not only being the greatest singer, songwriter and entertainer of the 20st century, but still having the passion and energy to take his bandmembers and audience to heights they never knew existed.",1222300800,,332,4.842105263157895
2807204,5,B000P1KTW8,This Blu-Ray DVD is a joy and view and to listent to.  Unlike some performance DVD's Bruce and Dublin Session band are fun to watch.  Everyone is having a great time and performance is rock solid.  Now this is NOT the E Street Band.  They perform a few songs from the E Street Band catalog but the majority is from the Seeger sessions and other solo material.  So if you expecting an E Street Band type of performance your going to in for a surprise. I enjoy seeing Bruce stretch out and he's obviously having a great time.  I rarely buy DVD's but I'm glad that I own this one.  I'll be viewing it many times,1213833600,,608,4.189655172413793
2807205,5,B000P1KTW8,"Audio quality is excelent, video / scenario is a little ""dark"", but the concert itself is contagious !",1209081600,,102,4.722222222222222
2807206,5,B000P1KTW8,My wife and I have seen BS & E St Band about 40 times since 1975.  We've seen the BS & the Sessions Band once.  We watched this with friends who haven't been to a live show.  They loved it.  We loved it.  We have a DLP projector setup and the 9 foot screen looks good in Blu-Ray on a PS3.,1201478400,,288,3.6557377049180326
2807207,3,B000P1KTW8,"The sessions band and Springsteen cover some of Bruce's older material recast into the old-timey style of his latest album, and surprisingly, siome of it works very well. The material that is actually folk stuff is of course done well, but a little goes a long way for fans of the Boss.

The Blu-Ray is a disappointment however. It is hard to qualify the video as being good for even a standard DVD, much less a Hi-Def offreing, with muddy blacks and grainy soft images throughout. The sound is flat and compressed, and the oom sound a little too up in the mix.",1186531200,3,561,4.446601941747573
2807208,5,B000P1KTW8,"I will start by saying I have been a big Springsteen for years. Have seen 5 of his performances live and he never fails to blow you away, the same goes for this dvd. The video portion is as good as it gets for a music performance. They did a nice job with not jumping around too much with the cameras.
The performance itself was as good as anything he has done. You really get into the scene and the music, wanting to jump up and clap your hands to the rythyms. The sound, I'm running out of superlatives here but the 5.1 pcm was totally awesome, putting you write in the middle of the band. Instruments and vocals are clear and precise.
I'm a total pervert, I mean convert to this form of music and oh! what he does with his older tunes, he should do more. He turned Open all night into something sensational.
Well, do you think I liked it?
If you either like this type of music or are a Springsteen fan open to new sounds do not run but haul a-s and get buy.",1183680000,,960,4.084656084656085
2807209,3,B000P1KTW8,"If this was really filmed in HD as label states I must need new glasses.  Just to watch this ""1080 Disc'  that's unclear, quite grainy and undefinded.
The Music get's 5 stars but the film and or transfer is not of the usual grade for HD.

Sorry but to keep it real the standard DVD upscaled on a PS-3 would look this good without the Blu-Ray package.",1181606400,5,350,4.1940298507462686
2807210,5,B000P1KTW8,"I live in Germany. The Blu-ray disc has been delayed here but I watched the DVD three times already. It is the best concert release ever and the finest music ever performed. I am a big Springsteen fan and I loved the Seeger Sessions tour (have been to 6 concerts) but even my friends who are totally not into Springsteen got goosebumps and agreed that this is the finest music ever played and the DVD offers the best sound quality we ever experienced. Everyone I know is going to buy the DVD and wants to see it over at my place again once I got hold of the blu-ray disc.

The picture though is not as clear as on Barcelona or New York City and it is way too dark. Many songs are cut and the audience's singing is not well integrated in the mix. The audience at these shows sang their hearts out and you can hardly hear it on the DVD. Only on some passages...anyway the greatest performance ever has been captured on disc with phenomenal sound. Everybody who cares about music and is open minded to something totally different, something never heard before is in for a treat!",1180828800,4,1075,4.348258706467662
2807211,5,B000P1KTW8,Great concert and Bruce has that spark in every concert he does. This man has brrought to me all the feeling that a man could have.,1375660800,,131,4.076923076923077
2807212,5,B000P1KTW8,My son asked for this as a gift.  We are both big fans of Bruce. Nice dvd.,1360540800,,74,3.3529411764705883
2807213,5,B000P1KTW8,I was introduced to the dvd by a friend and love it so much that I immediately ordered from amazon.com. The order as well as the delivery went well and the dvd arrived in cape town without damage. Thank you and I will definitely order through them again.,1360022400,,254,4.3125
2807214,5,B000P1KTW8,"This is not the standard Bruce fare. The band is the Irish based Sessions Band, not the E-Street gang. The concert was an outgrowth of the Woody Guthrie tribute that Springsteen recorded around 2005-2006, but all of the selections on this DVD are full of energy, talent and fun. The crowd is really into it and the show is up to it. Very talented musicians and Bruce spotlights them all. His stage presence may be a bit over the top at times but it doesn't matter as the music is so darn good.
Video quality is reasonable in blue-ray but the 5.1 sound is excellent. May be a few years old now but the music on this DVD is timeless.",1346284800,,631,4.266666666666667
2807215,5,B000P1KTW8,"an acoustical feast awesome,would recommend it to any one over a glass of wine or beer, on a friday night.",1338854400,,106,4.35
2807216,5,B000P1KTW8,"This Is Incrideble on Blu Ray. The concert Itself Is so good and the run down of songs much different than his uaual. Yet everyone plays In such harmony, this Is one more fine recorded performance of the Boss doing his thing, and has become a perfectionist In his music. These are all great songs given they not his usual hits live. But that's the reason It such a good performance. This one If you like Bruce at all and have a Blu Ray get In Blu Ray It's an unbelievable sharp picture with no guards In the way.
I think your going to love this If your looking at It.
Honestly",1329868800,,576,4.151785714285714
2807217,5,B000P1KTW8,"This blu-ray concert is quite a surprise.  It's not your typical ""Born in the USA"" album, it's actually more like songs from the American past, including folk songs and Christian anthems.  It's also the American experience, with their hopes and aspirations.  And it's a celebration of what America was, is, and will be.

At the end, there are three songs which are really amazing.  They are ""When The Saints Go Marching In,""  ""This Little Light Of Mine,"" and ""American Land"".  Many people are familiar with these popular songs.  And if you don't know them now, you will love them later when you groove with the concert.",1315008000,,619,4.773584905660377
2807218,5,B000P1KTW8,I had purchased the blueray about a year back. I still enjoy the songs almost on a daily basis. That's really evergreen.,1274918400,,120,4.5

8188197,5,B000P1KTW8,Great show!!,1471651200,,12,5.5
8188198,5,B000P1KTW8,I am not a big fan of Bruce Springsteen but I was very surprised at how well this show was done. The song's are excellent and his voice seems to be made for this type of music. The lyrics in most of the songs tell a story in true Irish style. The one down side is his wife really can't sing and can be heard over the other background singers. If you can get past that it's a really good show.,1468886400,,392,3.8518518518518516
