7093069,5,B00VKP5YUU,I stumbled across the Bob's Burgers series one day and decided to own all 5 sets.  It's about family.  It's about problems faced in every day life and how to deal with them.  It's about relating.  Every episode is based on current every day life.  It will keep you laughing and sighing.  It will challenge what you think is the best solution in each episode only to see what actually surprisingly happens.  You'll enjoy every episode!,1481241600,2,434,4.631578947368421

7093086,3,B00VKP5YUU,"This is one of the best written shows on television and family friendly but this product is inferior because of the made on demand quality. The box/inserts almost look like swap meet bootleg quality.  Wish Fox would step up and manufacture nicer box sets and put B.B. on blu-ray, they gave the show a 2 year renew so they clearly have faith in the show and the ratings wish they would back it up by offering the fans better quality products.",1453161600,7,441,4.444444444444445

Bobs Burgers is a funny, witty, well written & perfectly cast comedy.  So far we have never had a bad episode- it just keeps getting better.

I'm hoping that Season 5 actually comes in a DVD Box Set, opposed to a downloadable SD or HD Digital Version. Because I'm feeling like I'm missing out, so... I guess until Bob's Burgers Sn. #5 DVD BOX SET is released?!?!? Well, I'm going to be kind of empty inside.",1446940800,2,425,4.2592592592592595

Very happy and surprised it woulds in Australia, where our region is PAL based. If i did my research I wouldn't have paid as much for a reproduction.

7093102,4,B00VKP5YUU,"I love this show. The only reason this got a 4 not a 5, is it has no special features and, this is more of a problem with all casing in general, I don't like having to take a disk out to get the next one.",1440460800,,204,3.4565217391304346

7093105,1,B00VKP5YUU,My review is not a remark to the show however to the slap dash dvd set that sits before me now.  I love bobs burgers it is one of my top 5 favorite shows if i was just rating the show it would be 5 out of 5... so it is super disappointing cause the dvd set is so poorly made.  It reminds me of the japanese knock off box sets i used to buy on ebay years ago.  I own the first box set and it is nothing like this its a quality print.  When i put the discs into my blu ray player it recognizes them as dvd+r discs.  No special features and It costs 30 bucks to boot. Even as a fan of the show i say save your money or maybe buy the digital files or whatever.,1438128000,27,656,3.624113475177305

7093116,3,B00VKP5YUU,"This isn't worth the money. I love the series and I love this season, but the video on demand from amazon is absolute garbage. All you get are the episodes, no extra features, not even subtitles. Even Netflix gives you the subtitles! I wouldn't have purchased this if I had realized it was manufactured on demand.",1432771200,12,313,4.607142857142857
7093117,5,B00VKP5YUU,"Following the releases of the MODs for Season Two and Season Three, this third MOD set features a major fix of everything that reviewers complained about. I found no issues about it what-so-ever.

As in the 2nd and 3rd seasons, the color yellow was always faded in each episode. Now, in this fourth season MOD, the color yellow is actually as it's supposed to be. A bright yellow, instead of a faded yellowish-tan. Some proof of the artwork change is in the photo.

Now onto the artwork. The front artwork isn't blurry at all and doesn't bleed to white sections, as it did with the third season. The spine and back artwork are back to the plain white, as it was in the second. Honestly, the white isn't as bad, as the colors on the back are clear to read, unlike on the third season. It also features a clearer photo of Bob on the side, too. The disc artwork is still the same as it was before; high quality. To summarize, the artwork is all now high quality.

People also complained about the DVD-R quality. The quality is perfectly FINE. No issues at all with playback, scratching, freezing, nothing. The discs are perfectly fine. The discs come in a stacked case, an improved case that doesn't break when it travels on the shipping trucks, which is alot better than the inserted disc flips.

Onto the episodes and the show, just amazingly perfected. This season is possibly the best season of the show as of right now. ""Mazel Tina"" even won an Emmy for the episode. Incredible voice talents, great animation, and great stories/episodes. I have nothing else to say about this release, as it has imporved quality and a great season. Stop complaining and purchase this season now!",1431648000,13,1680,4.608695652173913
7093118,5,B00VKP5YUU,"I may sound biased here, on all accounts, but I assure you, despite what other people say. This show is the best one in the, ""animated, comedic"" style of shows like, ""family guy"" and, ""The simpsons"". Both are great, but most people dislike this show because well, it has a myriad of all types of humor. More mature humor than Family Guy, and The Simpsons, but it can also be immature as well. I will be reserving this, as I enjoy the witty, less violent humor present. Family Guy just seems to have devolved to boring, violent humor. It's hard to explain, and in the end. ALL of this is opinion. It has some IMMATURE moments, but most of it was witty, and actually made me genuinely laugh, unlike FG, and The Simpsons. The Simpsons is great, so is Family Guy. But both pale in comparison to this in my opinion.",1430352000,5,810,4.370860927152318
7093119,1,B00VKP5YUU,"Bob's Burgers Season 4. This is the season where the show goes slightly past the stride it found during its third season on Fox. It was about average for me and the cast is still as enjoyable as ever. 4/5

Onto the DVD itself. I know that many are willing to take this review with a grain of salt, but this is a wise warning to anyone who is interested in purchasing the DVD and has not purchased any of the previous seasons. If you enjoy having a physical copy of a DVD and you like the front DVD cover, this is for you. If you want special features, high quality playback on the episodes, and DVDs you can play in any media device, then stay clear away from this release.

As Fox's DVD sales have been hindered by the modern convenience of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon of course, they've resorted to these godawful MOD releases that are sold at expensive prices and work like a cheap service. You get barely even close to what you want and you end up stuck with DVDs you very well could have burned yourself, experienced or not. The same goes for seasons 2 and 3 on DVD. Great seasons, terrible DVDs. Season 1, however, despite poor quality on the episodes, there were plenty of special features and care that went into making that DVD set happen.

The only reason I see of buying this is if your internet connection is poor, or you cannot afford monthly rate for a streaming service. Otherwise, I recommend skipping on paying 30 bucks for this set and using it towards approximately 4 months of other streaming services. You get the entire fourth season, plus the first three, for a bargain, and even more.

The season itself - 4/5 (not included in final rating)
DVD - 1/10 (1 for the front cover, which is the only positive thing left of the MOD releases)",1430092800,15,1783,4.410334346504559
