6403626,5,B00K6K9GKO,This is for my sons christmas gift and I'm sure he will love it because his younger brother got really excited when he saw it.  Can't wait for christmas.,1416268800,,153,4.275862068965517
6403627,3,B00K6K9GKO,"My son and I both love Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, so I was excited to get him a holiday DVD for his birthday (a few weeks before Christmas) this year. However, when I received the DVD I realized that it contained episodes that we had already seen, instead of a holiday special like I was anticipating. I am a little disappointed that Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood hasn't done anything celebrating Christmas. I like the unique twist on holidays that they include in the show's episodes, but not enough to purchase a DVD of episodes we've already seen (and frankly, can view for free on Netflix or reruns on PBS). Unfortunately, I am returning the DVD. I'd like to give it more stars because we love the show, but for a holiday DVD (with a deceptively Christmas-y cover), it disappoints.",1413936000,39,785,4.737226277372263
6403628,5,B00K6K9GKO,"First of all I just love this little tiger with such a big heart.
From the moment that I first saw this cartoon on PBS I loved this huggable little tiger.
Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood is about Daniel Tiger he has some big adventures and learns about the world around him with his friends O the owl,Miss Elaina,Katerina Kittycat,and Prince Wednesday by his side and most importantly his loving and caring parents Mr and Mrs Tiger.
What I also love about this show is that all his friends each have unique personalities and interests, that shows each and every person is special in his or her own way. Each of his friends has their own catch phrase,too cute.
Daniel Tiger's holiday special Snowflake Day is a thirty minute episode about his neighborhood celebrating a winter holiday called Snowflake Day they exchange gifts and enjoy each other's company and also put on a community play.
This episode will make you feel all warm and snuggly all over.
I'm very happy that PBS put this special on DVD for watching over and over during the holiday viewing season.
The other episodes included do have a holiday theme.
""Something special for Dad"" (Father's Day)
""I Love you, Mom"" (Mother's Day)
""Thank-you,Grandpere Tiger"" (Grandparents Day)
""Katerina's costume"" (Each character making their own unique costume to wear on dress-up day)
""Dress-up Day"" (Trick or treating)
And ""Neighborhood Thank-you Day"" (Thanksgiving)
All together seven great episodes
Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood does not mention religious or commercialized holidays on his TV show but offers viewers friendly versions of holidays that we can recognize and relate to.
(I did wish that Snowflake Day had been a Holiday special with the mention of Christmas and Hanukkah in it like Arthur's Perfect Christmas my top favorite,and the Rugrats had a Christmas, Hanukkah, and Passover Specials)
I still highly recommend Daniel Tiger very much he is sweet and kind, everything each and every person should be in the world!
Buy this DVD and catch a ride on trolley to Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood and enter the Land of Make Believe

They recently removed it from Netflix and my antenna doesn't always receive the signal from PBS very well, so now she can watch her favorite show whenever she wants! These are just the holiday episodes so I also ordered the 3 pack that has most of the other 1st season episodes. I just hate how they are bundled by topic instead of by episode number.

The package came in great condition and undamaged. My daughter is going to love the little figure that comes with it. It's about the same size as her Little People figures and will fit right in. The figure looks a little cheap, but my 3yo will never know the difference.",1479340800,,736,4.372262773722627

And now, when she hangs out with her dad and me, she sings, ""I like to be with my family!"" I got this for her for Valentine's Day, but it just has one (or two?) ""Love Day"" episodes and other than that it's not really ""seasonal"" or anything--good for watching anytime. One thing I noticed: there are no little real-life mini-episodes at the end of these shows like the ones included in our other dvds...the little clips where real kids are doing things related to the show. It's no problem, but I thought I'd mention it!",1457827200,,697,4.584

6403744,5,B00K6K9GKO,"As a grandmother and retired preschool teacher, I would highly recommend all of the Daniel DVDs to help little ones deal with social/emotional issues that are important to them in everyday situations. The holiday video focuses on the meaning of family holidays, without specifically naming the holidays, so that families can extend the discussion and activities to meet their specific traditions. For example, after watching the ""Thank You Day"" segment together, my 3 1/2 year old grandson asked to make a thank you tree decoration for the dining room. On Thanksgiving he gave everyone a small thank you card to fill out and hang on the tree. What a perfect way to teach the meaning of the holiday, and to start a tradition that we can continue over the years. Thank you, Daniel!",1417219200,,779,4.864661654135339
