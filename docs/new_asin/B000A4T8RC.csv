The whole Druid Priestess thing just dosn't work here considering the Casting. There is Only One Zombie Scene that last about 5 minutes with 2 or 3 one second gore scenes. But even those look cheap. Everyone is trying to make a Zombie Movie These Days, and only a few have suceeded. I can name at least a dozen So Called Zombie Flicks I have seen in the past year or so, and this is the bottom of the barrell....along with ""Corpses are Forever"", ""Hood of the Living Dead"", ""Zombiez"", ""Feeding the Masses""....Skip them all, they are Not worth Seeing.(although ""Feeding the Masses"" may be worth a Rent) *Bottom line...If your going to make a Zombie movie, it should be about ZOMBIES !",1130371200,2,795,4.605633802816901

Ok I have been a bit dissapointed with Zombie Films of late and some of them just released that are quit horrible are"" Legion of the Dead"", Hide and Creep, Feeding the Masses, and now this piece of crap  Revolting Dead"". These are just some of the more  horrible and when I say horrible they truly are. There are other if you see my review for Feeding the Masses i name them, anyway.

The film has a total of 4 or 5 Zombies with not even decent make up, the acting is very bad and this movie tries very hard to be funny and is not at all just becomes very annoying.

Besides the fact this movie put me to sleep 2 times the third time I managed to watch with much use of the fast foward button on my DVD remote, just looking for something good to happen anything there is no action , and when there is itat about 1hour and 10 minutes in the film and is gone in just about7-8minutes.

This film is truly one of the worst i have seen, please they have this at blcokbuster rent it and you will see what I mean, plus this girl in it of one of the zombies has some type of powers and can shoot lasers out of her hands to electricute the Zombies and her dialogue and the way she acts is very cheesy and annoying.

So do yor self a favor and skip tis lame excuse for a Zombie movie, and true fan will even say how bad it is.

The one good thing is the naked girls girls, there are 3 of them and they are pretty hot and one them is quit large in the bra dept, which makes this flick the only thing woirth see'ing.",1127001600,2,1584,3.928125
