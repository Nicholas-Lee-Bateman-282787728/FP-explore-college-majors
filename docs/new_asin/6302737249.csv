506239,5,6302737249,"Looking at this film from a purely artistic standpoint, there's no doubt this is truly a fine artwork.  What is so hard to grasp is that it was done so realistically, so believably, that it's like watching real documentary or newsreel footage. No wonder the director had to include a statement that no such footage was used in his work.  How could he achieve such incredible effects, with such large crowds of extras and nonprofessionals in supporting and leading roles?  From this standpoint, this film is truly breathtaking--indeed, jaw dropping.  He tried to make his work well balanced and was quite successful; it's fair to both sides and there's no particular political statement to be had.  Only the tragedy and futility of war.",1487894400,8,735,4.943089430894309

506284,5,6302737249,"As an aficionado of revolution, it is rare to find a film so balanced.  Rather than take a clear side, this docudrama presents the viewer with a simple story on which they can make their own judgement.

On the Algerian side, there are fighter who seem to embody the will of the people, even as they make decisions that lead to the death of innocents on both sides.  It gives a very good idea of their methods, organizations, and characters, though very little detail as to who they are as individuals or why they have made the choices that they did.  On the French side, you have military men who are seeking to end a rebellion of not just a colony, but an actual part of French territory - they are brutal, transgressing legal boundaries with torture, and unable to see the point of view of their adversaries.  In a way, by their actions, they add to the alienation of the Algerians, which is to say that in the fight, a nation is essentially born.

This is an excellent film, fascinating in its detail and stimulating the interest to research further.  Recommended warmly.

Note:  the version I saw was in French and did not have subtitles of the sections in Algerian Arabic.",1476403200,,1177,4.514150943396227

It is a historic film about a terrorist organization that prevailed in removing the French government from colonial rule of Algeria. It is very pro-terrorist group (caught their point of view fairly well). The group later on became a political party, and the country experienced a lot more fighting off and on into the 1990s.

But once I understood the significance of the film I felt like an idiot. She made us analyze the film in an essay, which was good (in this case). I hope more professors use it in their classes. If mine didn't, I wouldn't have known about it. This is a very good film about Algerian independence from the French who oppressed them for so long. It's just that some scenes are very hard to watch: man's inhumanity to man. I find it interesting that it was banned in France. It sheds a lot of light....The special features are very nice.

506547,5,6302737249,"It's almost like watching a documentary, I kept reminding myself that all main people in the film were actors hired to play parts and not the real people themselves.  It is brilliantly filmed and acted.  The movie takes place during the 50's as France struggles to hold on to Algeria, a country in northern Africa.  They have ruled Algeria for 130 years and don't want to let go of their old colony.  This is odd in a way because they fought the Naz's tooth and nail and yet see no problem with keeping other people under their rule.  The Criterion collection presents the whole film in it unedited original release.  The spoken languages are both French and Arabic. I love historical films and this one is great.  It shows both sides, the FLN, the Arab terrorists and the French army both violating the rights of other people.  The French blow up a house and the FLN blows up two restaurants and airline office.  The film is in Black and White which lends to the Documentary feel of the film.  I recommend this movie.",1421884800,7,1018,4.5136612021857925

Detailed and very comprehensive, this history was a tough read ( my high school french  was often not up to the task of names and terms in french),  but I think very worth the effort to students of military history or political affairs.

Filmed in the style of a documentary, the film achieves a realism heretofore unheard of in cinema. The actors are unknowns (at least to me) and are without exception, well-cast. It's a gritty, blunt, no-holds-barred production that will keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 2 hour run time. While both sides of the conflict were guilty of horrible atrocities, the film is most definitely pro Algerian. The French are portrayed as callous, bigoted, and oblivious of the fate of the natives. The resistance and freedom fighters are heroic and determined.
This film is not one to sit down on a Friday evening with your date and a bowl of popcorn. One needs to focus on the conflict and think. The movie certainly made me think.
Criterion has once again delivered a high-quality edition, and while you won't be blown away by the picture, the extras are abundant and as usual, the accompanying essays are interesting and enhance the entire experience.
Highly recommended.",1373068800,3,1178,5.010204081632653

This is a very convincing, chilling account of the uprising that eroded the French colonialism in Algeria. You can oppress and push a people just so far before it rises up against the oppressors. (It would be well for the Israeli occupants of the West Bank to give serious thought to the documentary.)

A must for the student of colonialism.",1372032000,,378,4.8
506773,5,6302737249,"The Battle of Algiers is an Italian film directed by Gillo Pontecorvco, which was produced in 1966. It depicts true events which occurred during the Algerian war of independence from France, which was fought from 1955 - 1962. The events depicted in the movie occurred during the Battle of Algiers which took place from 1954-1957.
This film has been ranked in the top 100 films ever made. It was banned in France for five years where it was finally released in 1974. The Battle of Algiers is an important commentary on guerilla warfare.  Revolutionary guerilla fighters holed up and grouped together in cells in the Casbah section of Algiers. French paratroopers attempted to wipe them out. The movie is about this struggle and the methods used by both sides.
The tactics of the National Liberation Front (FLN) guerilla insurgency and the French counter-insurgency are shown in the film. The French colonial power committed atrocities against the civilian population of their Algerian colony and the colonized insurgents committed atrocities against the civilian population of their oppressors in a spiraling escalation of violence. The FLN engaged in acts of terrorism by placing bombs in public places such as restaurants, nightclubs, and airports, indiscriminately killing civilians in the European Quarter.  The French paratroopers tortured, intimidated, and murdered members of the FLN. The use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique is depicted.  Algeria eventually won its independence in 1962.
Some of the scenes that really struck me were the incidents of waterboarding by the French Paratroopers, the men of the FLN covering themselves in burqas like women to disguise themselves and escape detection,  FLN women dressing like European women and carrying bombs in baskets, and in the end the women ululating in victory when Algeria won its independence.
The Battle Algiers is as relevant today as it was in 1965. The film was screened by the Pentagon in August 2003 as a field guide to fighting terrorism. Former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brezezinski, said: ""If you want to understand what is happening right now in Iraq, I recommend The Battle of Algiers."" This film was also used by the Black Panthers as a training film. I am sure there are other terrorists groups that have been influenced by the film as well. The Boson Bombing suspects come immediately to mind.
The film, shot in black and white, is a triumph of realistic production values and heavily influence by Italian Neorealism of the 1950's. It was filmed on location in Algiers using the real locations in the European quarters and the Casbah. It was so realistic that Pontecorvo had to issue a disclaimer that not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage was used in his two hours of film. Everything was shot live.
The film was nominated  for Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film, Best Screen Play, and Best Director. It was the winner of the Venice Film Festival Golden Lion Award.",1371945600,,2979,5.096311475409836

Pontecorvo's directing is technically brilliant and worthy of classes on film and cinema.  For my purposes though, it is his historical treatment of the Algerian struggle for independence, the FLN, the French pied noirs, police, and military, that captivates.  Pontecorvo's sympathies are clear, but he presents them without over-simplifying a complex and difficult situation. He provides a graphic description of the organization and praxis of the FLN in the urban setting, as well as of the sub rosa black ops counterterrorism tactics as practiced by the OAS. The Battle of Algiers is a a timeless classic that presents an archetype of Rapoport's ""Second Wave"" of modern international terrorism.",1370736000,2,830,5.133333333333334

506876,4,6302737249,"In this award winning film, young Italian director and co-writer, Gillo Pontecorvo presents some amazing pictures of the Algerian rebellion against the French in the mid-1950's.  While the U. S. was busy trying to contain Communism in Korea, the French had their hands full with Indochina (Vietnam) and Algeria both colonial spoils of war.  The film doesn't go into the history of the French/European occupation other than it had been in place 130 years.  Soon to be deposed French King Charles X and Louis-Phillippe assumed authority over Algeria in 1830 after the defeat of the Barbary pirates and the breakup of the Ottoman Empire.

After decades of repression and economic prejudice, a citizen rebellion of the native Arabs began in about 1954 which is where this film begins.  The creation of the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) formalized the movement to take violent action against the French.  Initially this involved the killing of French police or soldiers and while shocking, the incidents  were isolated.  The French under the orders of the police commissioner blew up an apartment building in the Arab section killing hundreds of men, women and children.  This escalates the conflict which becomes a full-scale revolution with the primary weapons of the rebels being assassinations and terrorist activities.

Much of the film's realism comes from screenwriter Franco Solinas who was imprisoned by the French as one of the terrorists during the period depicted in the film.  The film is stark and brutal and while Solinas and Pontecorvo's bias is clear, they do show with great clarity both sides are not without criticism.  Perhaps the most famous example is when 3 Arab women put on make-up, fix their hair and wear Western clothing in order to bypass security checkpoints and infiltrate clubs, bars and airports in order to discharge their time bombs.  You can see some remorse as they and the cameras circle the rooms filled with teenagers dancing, a child eating an ice cream cone and couples enjoying a cocktail.  Still, they have other priorities.

Shot in black and white, Pontecorvo does an amazing job showing the bombings (obviously no CGI or green screen) and the crowd uprisings.  It has been praised as having an almost documentary feel by some.  I agree.  The film was made using Algerian non-professional actors including those in lead roles.  Only 2 professional actors were used.  Jean Martin as French Colonel Mathieu is one and he is excellent.  Mathieu is professional and focused on quelling the uprising.  He does not shy away from torture as a means to an end, but is not without compassion either.

Certainly the filmmakers wanted to make a movie sympathetic to the rebels and move the audience in that direction.  This was hard for me to do.  Everything in this film can be easily updated to current times.  For me terrorism that results in the targeted loss of innocent lives leaves me cold regardless of the cause.  Without question, the French weren't wanted and made more than their share of transgressions.  This uprising ended in 1957 but began again unexpectedly in 1960 resulting in independence in 1962.  Great political film.

This Criterion package is remarkable.  It comes with a 55 page booklet which includes interviews, biographies and other background material.  Disc one has the film, 2 documentaries, interviews with 5 modern directors, production gallery and trailers.  Disc 2 includes 4 more documentaries.  Both the video and audio are excellent. For those interested in the video transfer and audio details here are exerpts from the booklet:

506878,5,6302737249,"I'm sure that I had heard of this film long before I ever saw it.  I had definitely seen clips from it (most memorably in the brilliant BBC documentary series ""The Trap"" by Adam Curtis).  But it wasn't until I read the book ""Thinking Like a Terrorist"" by former FBI special agent Mike German that I finally decided to watch it.  German argues that this is the one movie you absolutely must see if you want to understand terrorism.  It illustrates how terrorists operate, what their strategy is, what their objectives are, and why they do what they do.  It also shows why efforts to fight terrorism often prove counterproductive, and end up playing right into the terrorists' hands.  German notes that terrorist groups all around the world routinely watch this movie as part of their indoctrination and training.  It is also a favorite among military, intelligence, and counterterrorism professionals, who watch it in order to better understand what they're up against.  In fact, a special screening of this film was held at the Pentagon in late 2003 in order to help defense officials better prepare for dealing with the growing insurgency in Iraq.  Apparently, this is the film to watch if you want to learn about terrorism.  And, since I'm a political scientist with a special interest in political violence, I had to see it for myself.

My verdict:  It's an amazing film.  It's everything German claimed it would be, and more.  Much more.  Not only is it the definitive cinematic case study of terrorism, it is also one of the finest pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen.  It sheds light on an important historical event, and does so in a way that is both honest and evenhanded.  It's the sort of movie that raises difficult ethical questions, and refuses to give easy answers.  It resists the urge to paint anyone as either hero or villain.  It allows us to feel sympathy for both sides in the conflict without ever excusing either side's brutality.  Besides that, it's simply a really well-made film.  Director Gillo Pontecorvo did an excellent job.  Shot on location in Algiers just a few years after the events portrayed in the movie, it has an authentic look and feel to it that you just couldn't replicate on a Hollywood set.  The scenes shot in the claustrophobic streets of the Casbah -- the old city of Algiers, where the Muslims lived, segregated from the Europeans in the more modern parts of the city -- are particularly spectacular.  Many of the people you see on screen are not professional actors, but are Algerian locals recruited by the director to appear in the film.  In a few cases, the actual people who were involved in the Algerian War portray themselves in the movie.  The story is engaging from start to finish; and the acting and direction are superb.

""The Battle of Algiers"" (""La Bataille d'Alger"") is, as the title suggests, the cinematic retelling of the story of a key phase of the Algerian War (1954-1962).  This movie is not a documentary.  Rather, it's a scripted drama based on a slightly fictionalized version of the actual events.  The movie gives a somewhat simplified account of what happened, and uses composite characters in some places.  But it still manages to capture the essence of the story of how Algeria won its independence from France.

Algeria had been ruled by France since 1830, and had been considered an integral part of the French state since 1848.  Since that time, it had acquired a large population of settlers from Europe, and their descendents -- known locally as ""pieds-noirs"" -- who lived mainly in the coastal cities such as Algiers, and who enjoyed all of the rights and privileges of French citizens.  Unfortunately, the indigenous Muslims of Algeria did not enjoy these same rights and privileges, and were forced to endure treatment similar to that of blacks in the American South under Jim Crow.  This led to a great deal of resentment, and to growing demands by Algerian Muslims for equal rights.  When those demands were ignored by the French, a number of native Algerians decided that it was time to reclaim their homeland and seek independence from France.  In the mid-1950s, these disaffected Algerian Muslims formed the Front de Libration Nationale (FLN) -- i.e. the National Liberation Front -- and launched a campaign designed to get the French out of Algeria once and for all.  The FLN was very well-organized, and followed a very well-thought-out strategy for achieving their objectives.  They made effective use of propaganda both to attract support to their cause and to justify their actions to the world.  They also made very effective use of violence -- from the assassination of police officers on the streets of Algiers, to coordinated terrorist bombings throughout the European sections of the city, targeting civilian pieds-noirs.  It wasn't a mindless campaign of random violence.  Rather, it was strategically targeted violence, carefully orchestrated to provoke a very specific reaction.  And it worked.  The FLN got the exact reaction it was hoping for: a violent and oppressive crackdown by the French authorities that only served to further alienate the Muslim population, making it easier for the FLN to recruit more and more Algerians to its cause.  Eventually, pretty much the entire indigenous Algerian population was in open revolt; and it became too costly for the French to continue trying to maintain order.  The French people were also losing confidence in their government's ability to deal with the Algerian situation.  In the end, France had little choice but to cut their losses and grant full independence to Algeria in 1962.  The terrorists had won.

Shortly after independence, the newly formed Algerian government commissioned Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo to make a movie about the war so the entire world, and future generations, would know what happened.  They didn't want a propaganda film that would whitewash history, falsely portraying the war as a morally-unambiguous clash between noble heroes who could do no wrong and dastardly villains who deserved no sympathy.  Instead, they wanted an honest portrait of what had happened -- one that was fair to both sides, and yet pulled no punches when it came to showing the atrocities that both sides committed during the conflict.  And that's exactly what Pontecorvo put on film.  When this movie was released in 1966 -- just four years after the end of the Algerian War -- it shocked the world.  It was extremely controversial, especially in France, where it was banned for several years because its portrayal of the Algerian Muslims and the FLN was considered too sympathetic.  But the film won widespread critical acclaim; and it is still regarded by film critics today as one of the best movies ever made.  I'm inclined to agree.

If you want to learn about terrorism, if you want to learn about the Algerian War, or if you just want to watch a great movie, I highly recommend ""The Battle of Algiers"".

So, here are the relevant technical details:  The film is black & white, and has a running time of two hours.  The dialogue is in French and Arabic, with English subtitles.  This particular DVD set has tons of bonus materials, including a documentary about the life and career of director Gillo Pontecorvo, a documentary about the making of the film, a series of interviews with five famous filmmakers about why this is such a great movie, a documentary about the Algerian revolution, interviews with French military officers who fought in Algeria about the torture and execution of captured FLN terrorists, a discussion between two former top U.S. counterterrorism officials about what this film has to teach us about terrorism and how to fight it, and a documentary about Gillo Pontecorvo's return to Algiers in the early 1990s to see how the Algerian people have fared since winning their independence.  All of these bonus materials are worth watching; but, from my own perspective, the discussion about terrorism and counterterrorism -- featuring Richard A. Clarke, formerly of the National Security Council, and Michael A. Sheehan, formerly of the State Department -- is especially valuable.  Because of these bonus materials, I would recommend this particular DVD set over any other version of the film you may find.",1333238400,7,8299,4.960202604920405
506879,5,6302737249,"This is a review of the Criterion Collection version of the Battle of Algiers.  Other reviewers have given the content of the movie itself, so I'll just note that it consists of a rather even-handed look at the battle between the French colonialists and the Algerians who wanted to decolonize the country and were organized around the FLN.

I've titled this review the elephant of Algiers because watching the many documentaries that Criterion packages with the film made me think of the story about the blind men and the elephant.  Some said the elephant was long and skinny because they felt the tail, while others said it was like a column because they felt its foot.  Everyone takes different messages from the film and it functions in many different ways for the various people involved in it as producers or watchers.

Gillo Pontecorvo was lucky in that, even though he'd lost faith in the Communist Party after the Hungarian invasion in 1956, he was able to find another party to believe in - the FLN.  Then he was also able to make the main statement about the Algerian war, one that is a great artistic achievement as well as an historical document. But then Pontecorvo was never able to fully recapture this filmmaking experience and afterwards had many failed projects, so it seems that the film stands as a reproach to him in later life as what he could have done again.  The short documentary ""Five Directors"" on the 2nd disk consists of interviews with directors like Mira Nair and Oliver Stone, and its clear that the Battle of Algiers is both an inspiration and a reproach to them.  They talk about how they can't make films that political any more, but it's clear that it bothers them.  That sense of loss or lack also permeates the documentary ""Gillo Pontecorvo: The Dictatorship of Truth,"" narrated by Edward Said.  Pontecorvo was going to make a film about the Palestinians, but it was never finished.  The ghost of that project seems to be what's driving this documentary.

People who are happy about the film as a creative endeavor: Ennio Morricone and Saadi Yacef.  Morricone talks about the process of creating music for the film and sees it as a personal milestone, and rightly, since the music is truly haunting.  This was one of the most interesting parts of the documentary on the making of the Battle of Algiers, found on the 2nd disk. Also, in this documentary we learn from Saadi Yacef, one of the FLN leaders of the battle itself and a producer of the movie, that the Algerians were looking for a director to make a movie on the topic and finally settled on Pontecorvo.  Perhaps this was one of the reasons why this film was finished, unlike many other Pontecorvo projects.  Yacef is extremely pleased with the film and doesn't seem to suffer from unmanifested creative urges, which makes a nice contrast to the other people involved.

The documentary ""Remembering History"" on the 3rd disc is really great.  It gives an excellent historical overview of the Algerian War of Independence, bringing in the battles in the countryside as well as in Algiers itself.  Yacef is also extensively interviewed for this documentary.  I showed this in a class on imperialism and it was well received.  It provides a view from both the Algerian and the French side.

Just the French side is presented on ""Etats d'armes"" and its a dark one.  This is a French documentary about the French use of torture in Algeria.  We see how the use of torture affected those doing the torture.  Although this was a powerful documentary, I'd like to lodge a general complaint against documentary makers who don't identify the people talking.  Why do they do this?  It's important to know who these people are.  There's a devout Catholic who  was so tormented by having to torture that he didn't go to church for two years.  There's a rather terrifying little old man with one eye who says he hung Ben M'hidi in his cell, or had him hung.  The documentary ends with one French man from the 1960s saying that torture doesn't work because it just makes more enemies. This is an important message that I agree with.  Interestingly, the US governmental officials in ""The Battle of Algiers: A Case Study"" (Richard A. Clarke and Michael Sheehan) also come out against torture, saying it doesn't work.  So stopping its use would be a good thing, right?  This documentary is interesting because it shows a highly blinkered view of the Algerian case.  Clarke and Sheehan discuss the movie and the war as if imperialism didn't exist and there was no wave of decolonization at the time.  Also, they act like the Algerians started the bombing campaign in Algers when the film rightly shows that right-wing French extremists started it.

The last documentary on the 3rd disk, ""Gillo Pontecorvo: Return to Algiers"" is an Italian TV documentary, hysterical in both form and content, that follows Pontecorvo on a return to Algiers in 1992, before the Algerian Civil War began and when the FLN was starting to lose control.  While the TV show uses the tropes of Islamic fundamentalism and Islam as a general danger, Pontecorvo serves as a voice of reason and historical thinking, placing the situation in broader context.  This shows that even if he didn't make other movies as great as The Battle of Algiers, he has played an important role as a public intellectual.  And anyway, the number of people who have made a film as great as this one are very small indeed.",1328313600,2,5450,4.7441613588110405
506880,5,6302737249,"Few films articulate the feelings of an oppressed people in a country occupied by foreign military forces than the Battle of Algiers. The cinematography is magnificent, the casting is perfect and story itself is very moving.

The thing about this film is that it is balanced and fair.

It looks at the occupation of Algiers by the French from both sides, and ultimately shows the futility in trying to turn a centuries old culture into something else. It shows how torture increases resistance, and delivers a black eye to those who use it. Occupations almost always end badly for the occupier. History has shown us this time and again. George Santayana, the Spanish poet said those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.

This film is just as valid today as it was 40 years ago.",1323475200,,794,4.6571428571428575
506881,5,6302737249,"The Battle of Algiers is a film that feels like a documentary. An excellent one. But astoundingly, this film did not use any documentary stock. Gillo Pontecorvo faithfully recreates the struggle that Algerians had to achieve their independence from France. While the film shows the tragedy on both sides, the film clearly has an anticolonialist side and of course is one of the best anti war films ever made. The film is raw and visceral and sometimes it's difficult to watch but it's necessary so you can fully undestand the magnitude of what was happening in Algeria.

What is amazing and unfortunate, is that what it's happening in the world today is very similar of what happened in the film. All the wars, terrorists acts and battles that affect our world in these days, resembles a lot of the tactics that both the french army and the Algerian rebels employ in the film. This movie is truly a must see and it's enormous impact still remains until this Day.

Video & Audio
Criterion has done a terrfico Job with this film. Black levels are excellent, contrast is strong and detail is amazing. Some inherent softness and damage is apparent in some scenes but overall is a spectacular transfer which has been carefully and faithfully resultes.

The uncompressed monoaural soundtrack is also pretty terrific. Clarity is remarkable and there is no sign of damage or hiss.

506883,5,6302737249,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- There are so many obvious places to go when discussing The Battle of Algiers. It's almost certainly an accident (though one never knows) that the film was originally released by Criterion on DVD just as the whole Abu Ghraib torture scandal was heating up. It's easy to talk about the debate between terrorist and ""freedom fighter,"" and how it's easy to look at the French as evil and the NLF as good because the Algerian's won their independence. The film also brings up the issues of acceptable tactics; is it okay to target civilians or use children to conduct urban warfare?

Certainly The Battle of Algiers raises these questions, and more--more than most films in the history of cinema. However, what is truly striking about The Battle of Algiers is not the historical moment it attempts to recreate, nor the ethical questions it raises. The most striking thing about The Battle of Algiers is its cinematic achievements. Viewers who know nothing, and care even less, about Algerian political history or revolutions in general can marvel at the tense plotting and amazing visual of the film. Long before faux documentary became the rage, The Battle of Algiers takes a stark, black-and-white look at the world of Algerian resistance. In the extras we learn that the film was at one time proceeded by the warning that none of the footage was from documentaries or newsreels. Honestly, they could have fooled me. There's an immediacy to the presentation of this film that goes far beyond its ""ripped from the headlines"" story.

In fact, the immediacy of the visuals and the story go a long way towards deflating the expectations generated by decades of constant praise. Returning to a film from 1966 with fresh eyes, especially a film as highly regarded as this one, can often be a deadening experience; some film simply can't live up to the hype. The Battle of Algiers is one of those that can, precisely because it's a well-crafted cinematic experience, not just agitprop for would-be revolutionaries. I would argue, finally, that the film taught more filmmakers how to make better films than it taught revolutionaries how to throw bombs.

For a film this important, and one with this much history surrounding both its subject and creation, Criterion pulled out all the stops. Their original 2004 DVD was a three disc affair, and it's been ported whole hog to Blu-ray, though the number of discs has dwindled to two. The 1.85:1 AVC-encoded transfer looks simply spectacular. The film itself is slightly damaged and looks murky in places, but considering the age and budget of the film this is a loving restoration. The amount of fine detail in the frame is impressive, as is the contrast of this black-and-white masterpiece. Grain is pretty omnipresent, but handled perfectly. The PCM 1.0 track is similarly hampered by its age, but the clarity and depth is pretty impressive for a soundtrack of this vintage. Voices are clear and distinct, and the film's excellent use of music stands out most beautifully.

The extras are simply staggering. For those desiring more knowledge about the making of the film, there are two different documentaries. The first is 37 minutes and covers director Pontecorvo's life and art more generally, while the second (""Marxist Poetry"") lasts almost an hour and covers the making of the film specifically by conducting new interviews with some of the participants. Pontecorvo appears again for another hour-long documentary, this time chronicling his return to Algiers after a quarter century away. For those desiring more info about the French-Algerian war, Criterion has rounded up a pair of documentaries on the conflict. The first is an hour-long examination of both sides, while the second is about half as long and looks at things from a purely French perspective. The film's afterlife is also examined. In a 17-minute featurette, five directors (Spike Lee, Mira Nair, Julian Schnabel, Steven Soderburgh, and Oliver Stone) provide their own interpretations, reminisces, and appreciations for the film. There is also an excerpt from a 2004 ABC News show that demonstrates how guerilla fighting is still conducted along the lines show in the film, demonstrating its continued relevance. There are also a pair of the film's trailers, and a production gallery. Criterion's usual booklet contains essays from critic Peter Matthews, co-star Saadi Yacef, and an interview with screenwriter Franco Solinas

506884,5,6302737249,"This film chronicling the struggle for algerian independence was very influential on audiences unfamiliar or ambivalent towards this guerrila war -- a new warfare that we would see again in Vietnam. the style is familiar to that used in costas-gavras' Z, semi-documentary format.  You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. English sub-titles are short and do not distract from the screen. I want this collection very badly. Hope it will be reissued w/o blu-ray for less.  I saw the movie when it came out and watched it again from netflix rentals.
It will be good for suspenseful action film fans, for lovers of military and general history, and especially for those who want to know what kind of terrorist wars we are fighting now. A lesser known film but an excellent one on the same subject is Deserter aka Simon:the Legionnaire. It is in English and co-stars the up and coming actor Tom Hardy. It is fiction but based on real people and events.

This film produced considerable political controversy in France and was banned there for five years. This is great resistance film. The Battle of Algiers is a political film about the Algerian struggle for independence from France. It is a historical document from the time period that this struggle was occurring. It stands as a timeless example of a great revolution film. The spirit of revolution runs through the film. Aside from being an interesting historical film it is also a tour inside a dangerous & bloody revolution.

506927,1,6302737249,"Well, in the beginning of the film an fln communique is read wherein the terrorists demand the ""restoration of the algerian state"". Problem is: there has been no ""algerian state"" before the french moved in 1830.
""Algeria"" has been a part of the ottoman empire (colonialism, ay?), reigned by pirates, pretty much as the taliban controlled afghanistan before the US moved in. Ever listend to Mozart's ""The Abduction from the Serail""?

Did the algerians want to be independent of france? Yes, some clearly liked to. Problem is: As these nasty men and women didn't find enough support in the beginning, they began to slit the throats of some fellow algerians to make the others fall in line (freedom fighters, ay?).

So You may take this film as a typical, one sided sixties version of the events. You can learn from this film what west european lefties thought of ""islamic freedom fighters"" in the sixties. I guess our own view of thes people differs somewhat after 09/11...",1289433600,16,971,4.843373493975903

The special features included in this Criterion Collection are also superb. 'A Case Study' featuring the opinions of the Americans is a real eye-opener as it shows clearly just how completely blinkered and ignorant they are to the point of this movie, and to the subject of terrorism in general. The Americans take it as a given that the French had a right to occupy Algeria and that French colonial violence was therefore perfectly legitimate and acceptable, as opposed to the violence of the resistance movement. It provides a useful insight into the thinking behind America's present misguided 'War on Terrorism'.",1277856000,2,655,5.064814814814815
506929,5,6302737249,"The film is a remarkably balanced portrayal of the initiation and development of a street thug, Ali La Pointe, as he is taken up into the FLN movement. We see the terror on both sides,of the State's institutional aggression-guillotine,torture,bombs,curfews,checkpoints,searches, and  on the other side, the random bombing of civilian areas,the random shootings of civilans and police in the streets by the FLN recruits. The mobilization of crowd scenes is very effective,the documentary approach to the subject matter where key moments,e.g. `the milk-bar killings',the quelling of popular uprisings, are reconstructed, or there is insertion of documentary news footage,making this film a vital historical document by a major film maker.

Mathieu,the Colonel of the paratroopers, uses methods he learned in the Resistamce of France against the Nazis. He fails to see that the Germans occupied France as the French are occupying Algeria,the FLN (the Algerian National Liberation Front) are similarly a resistance movement designed to overcome the unjust occupation of Algeria by a colonial power. Both sides use equally cruel methods,but rebellion leading to popular uprisings on a national scale are hard to overcome. The decline of colonialism is on the rise and the French have already met their Waterloo at Dien Bien Phu. The French have in the name of civilization exploited Algeria for 150 years but without benefitting the native Arabs,who do not gain access to jobs or education. The time has come for Algeria to become an independent nation.

This black and white film using people involved in the Algerian resistance,non acting natives and one or two professional actors made a timeless template for the growth of resistance movements,the rise of terrorism,the attack against civilians in modern warfare in 20th century. This ranks as one of the 2 or 3 best black and white films of all time,including The Gospel According to St. Matthew and Paths of Glory. The vividly realistic dramatization of political events in the actual locations where they occurred in the Casbah and the avenues of the French quarter with such intimate immediacy has never been bettered. The acting of Mathieu(Martin) as a hero of charismatic proportions gives a rational voice to French colonialists and is superbly done and gives a balance to the film,only the system he represents is of a power now ebbing away. This film still speaks with an amazing force,35 years after I first saw it. The French won the battle but lost the war.",1272326400,2,2518,5.2431761786600495
506930,5,6302737249,"La battaglia di Algeri - The Battle for Algeria (1966) from
Director Gillo Pontecorvo, is a monumental achievement, an epic
that leaves no stone unturned, no taboo unexposed, no analytical
possibility unconsidered, no emotion unfelt. A like this one can
change lives, can wake spectators from their political doldrums.

This work is fascinating for those having a limited knowledge or
exposure to civilization in the Maghreb, the last 130 years
history, how local people present themselves day to day in public,
colonialism, etc. In the 1950's and 60's, modern day Algeria was
divided into what was called the ""Casbah"" (ghetto of 80,000) and
the ""European city"". Trades blossomed as seen also in any other
Mediterranean or European city,  shops and cars, the only
difference the language, the attire of women, the religion and
social values.

The picture brings back a time when the military institution was
still indispensable to national security, to national identity, to
the economy, the psychology of each and every person as every
citizen turning 18 was conscripted for a minimum term of 2 years,
either to the army or to the police corps -  no longer the case in
2010,  with a professional volunteer army.

The Cold War is still very visible, Cuba, USSR, Eastern nations
and others adhering to a particular political ideology, as
compared to the West. In this respect, allowing Algeria to walk in
the footsteps of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to
auto-determination was a risk, from possible changing to either
rival system.

From a DVD release perspective, there is a remarkable clarity to
each and every scene, a natural richness which is impressive and
real to this day. Even the night scenes are crystal clear, as is
the soundtrack and music on a 5.1 home theatre, by Ennio
Morricone. The dialog and subtitles in Spanish are perfect.

The story revolves around guerrillas within city confines in 1954,
both the French Army and the Mujahideen experts in the assembling
and operation of IED's, disguises, shootout in plain view, the
majority population caught in the middle.

Various aspects are covered, such as occupying forces,
paratroopers, helicopters, opponents rolling over,  water
boarding, electric shocks,  rope suspension, blow torch
interrogations, checkpoints, surveillance tapes.

The justice system locally, when called upon, used the guillotine
to carry out sentences, asrandom police officers were taken out or
stabbed, and precincts overrun.

The tenacity of the ideology is such as the instinct for
self-preservation in some cases, disappears entirely, giving way
to a desire in making a dent in the enemy. Members are sternly
warned against partaking in the city's narcotics, gambling,
brothel and alcohol services, which are long-standing.

Barbed wire is deployed at key points in the city, with sandbags,
with sentinels.

The French troops head Col Mathieu, and the rebels, realize that
the conflict is won in the hearts and minds of its  citizens, and
not only on the ground such that, both sides adopt propaganda
methods (radio, blow horn, freebies, good PR) - despite suggesting
the resistance is a tape worm, requiring strong opposing actions.
In 1962, France relinquishes its power over the colony.",1268784000,,3236,5.230174081237911
506931,5,6302737249,"Algiers, French Algeria, 1956: Algeria has existed under French colonial rule for one hundred and thirty years, the impoverished Arab occupants of the city of Algiers living predominantly within the gentrified Casbah region of the city. In the Spring of 1956, Larbi Ben M'Hidi's ideologically Islamic FLN party begins waging a concerted Guerilla war of aggression against French colonial power. It begins with the murder of French police, military and officials on the streets, but then escalates into widespread destruction as French frequented Cafes, Milk Bars and Airlines are targeted by FLN bombers (in response to the ruthless bombing of a suspected FLN assassin by a vigilante element within the French authorities). As the violence escalates, the Tenth Airborne division of the French army, commanded by Philippe Mathieu, a distinguished World War Two veteran, are tasked with quelling the insurgency and restoring order to the streets of Algiers. A task which they undertake with devastating ruthlessness and frightening efficiency...

Despite being over forty three years old, Gillo Pontecorvo's, ""The Battle Of Algiers"" remains one of the most devastatingly relevant films ever made. Shot in nascent neo-realist, verite style which recalls Rossellini (Pontecorvo quit his job as a journalist and became a film-maker after experiencing an epiphany following a viewing of Rossellin's ""Paisan"") and adapted from a book by FLN leader Saadi Yacef (who also appears in the film as FLN commando, `Jaffar'), it is quite simply timeless. The political radicalisation of Ali La Pointe, a young, unemployed, illiterate labourer who becomes a violent zealot (or `freedom fighter', depending on your point of view) after being robbed of a future and left to rot in the Casbah, is a story which one has seen repeated in the biographies of numerous terrorist paramilitaries who have menaced the world throughout the twentieth and twenty first centuries. Similarly, it is impossible to watch the harrowing scenes of French nationals being bombed in Cafes and the Gendarmerie being gunned down in the streets without recalling the terrorist campaigns of any number of 'revolutionary armies' from the PLO through to the IRA. Accordingly, the haunting spectacle of Algerian nationals being by tortured French Paratroopers in order to gather intelligence on FLN leaders recalls the horrifying spectre of Abu Ghraib prison.

""The Battle Of Algiers"" is a film that demands to be seen - not only because is it one of the greatest films ever made, but also because, in microcosm, it is the recurrent story of the second half of the twentieth century.",1262908800,3,2637,5.321342925659472
506932,5,6302737249,"Filmed with many of the actual participants in the sixties when the old values came crashing down as the students rushed to the barricades and revolution was sexy, Battle of Algiers, while still undeniably great film-making, has become a very different film since the decade of rebellion. Indeed, it seems to become a different film every decade: not only have people's revolutions such as Iran resulted in repressive fundamentalist dictatorships where human rights are ignored and rape victims are executed alongside their rapists, but once again foreign troops occupy Arab countries imposing their idea of civilisation on an unwilling population. As a result, the film takes on a very different perspective almost every time you see it, challenging your preconceptions each time.

Dedicated to the people of Algiers, it is more an account of the rise and fall of the Algerian Liberation Front (FLN) between 1954-7 than the popular resistance to the French occupation, following their strategies and the response of the increasingly militarised French. The country's genuine revolution and liberation in 1962 is dealt with almost as an afterthought in the film's epilogue.

With the visual authenticity of a newsreel, the lean construction of a documentary and a gripping immediacy to many of its scenes, the film is fairly even handed in its treatment of the outrages on both sides, but never allows either side to justify or even explain itself. Only in the UN's habitual cowardice in refusing to take a stand on the issue is the reason for the escalation in violence, rather than the ideology that drives it, made apparent.

Certainly, for all the rightness of their cause, the FLN's methods are, by necessity, so brutal and dictatorial that automatic sympathy for them is out of the question. They rule by fear, clearing (translation: driving out or murdering) the Casbah of prostitutes, junkies and crooks not for any moral reason but to ensure a safe hideout. The petty criminal turned freedom fighter 'hero' machine-guns the man who raised him because he will not help the party; a woman leaves a bomb in a milk bar with children in it without a trace of conscience or remorse; passers-by are machine-gunned from a speeding ambulance. So lacking in pity or simple human decency are they and so callous is their disregard for human life that it is almost impossible not to hold them in contempt while still supporting the principle their fight for freedom - this is a film that doesn't romanticise the moral price at which that freedom is bought. Nor, more surprisingly still, does it demonise the French (many themselves veterans of the French resistance to occupation of their own country during WW2) and their response. It's almost as if the film is challenging you to hate its heroes and sympathise with its villains while at times lucidly explaining why both sides are driven to such desperate measures. It's something a filmmaker as relentlessly partisan as Ken Loach would never have the guts to attempt or the skill to pull off.

Certainly it is one of the ironies of time and hindsight that whereas in 1965 the French were so obviously the undisputed villains of the piece that the film was banned in France, now their actions seem, if not morally justifiable, at least understandable. Fighting an unseen enemy hiding behind the civilian population, with each member knowing only three others in the organisation, the French cannot find them because even they do not know who or where they are. Afraid of another Dien Bien Phu and faced with a lack of political will by their government, you understand why the French paratroops resort to torture as their only means of gaining information in the face of increasing outrages aimed indiscriminately at the civilian population. It's all part of a desperately escalating series of immoral outrages on both sides, with the occupiers never understanding why it's their atrocities that draw more public outrage than those they're fighting against - at one point, the French Colonel is moved to wonder ""Why are the Sartres always on the other side?"" on learning of the popular support for the FLN among the left-wing intellectuals, a sentiment that still holds true of the military and political mindset that looks upon rebellion and terrorism as a purely logistical and tactical problem today. The film was screened at the Pentagon in 2003 and it's clear that they saw nothing in it but tactics.

This pragmatic loss of ordinary standards of decency is inherent in the film: even though Pontecorvo shows the reasons for the atrocities on both sides, that doesn't undermine the savagery of the acts themselves. Interestingly, the film's trailer adds voice-over from many of the participants explaining their motivations more clearly than the film itself, but in many ways the film really reflects the point of co-producer and real life senior FLN figure Yacef Saadi's original book - not a handbook or a celebration so much as a explanation of just why pity had to quickly fall by the wayside on both sides. The success of the film is that it doesn't feel the need to mitigate any of its protagonists actions with comforting emotional outlets or devices to add sympathy and point the audience, whether it's the girl in the milkbar or the French colonel who can publicly admire one of the rebels at a press conference before (by implication) arranging his suicide in his cells because he recognises he's still a danger even in captivity. It's a rare unflinching portrait of revolution in all its ugliness and moral vacuity (rather than ambiguity) where the object becomes all-consuming and all-destroying on both sides. Yacef Saadi's final small victory isn't military - it was the people themselves who won their freedom rather than their self-proclaimed champions - it's that he finally sees beyond the kind of empty nihilistic gestures that leads others to pointlessly martyr themselves. It's a human reaction and one that puts life - even if it is only his own - and the hope for change that life still carries first, yet Pontecorvo never overstates it.

It's not a film that gives easy answers or clear cut heroes and villains, and Criterion's superlative 3-disc NTSC DVD set more than amply addresses the moral contradictions in a truly impressive array of supplements that look at the film in a post-9/11 light. You can hardly move for documentaries both on the film itself and its influence - Gillo Pontecorvo - The Dictatorship of Truth, Marxist Poetry - The Making of The Battle of Algiers and Five Directors - and the history and aftermath of the revolution - Remembering History, The Battle of Algiers - A Case Study and Gillo Pontecorvo's Return to Algiers - as well as a 28-minute extract from documentary Etats d'Armes in which French soldiers talk about the use of torture in the war. Throw in a couple of trailers, a 54-page booklet and an excellent transfer and it's one of the finest releases Criterion ever put out.",1261267200,11,6993,4.962457337883959
506933,5,6302737249,"It was 1966 when the film ""The Battle of Algiers"" (La battaglia di Algeri) was released to the masses.  A war film about the war in Algiers covering what took place between November 1954 through December 1960, during the Algerian War of Independence and director Gillo Pontecorvo covered both sides between the Muslim Algerians fighting for Independence and the French who were fighting against terrorism.  The film is regarded as an important classic and is Pontecorvo's masterpiece.  The film won the Venice Film Festival Grand Prize, nominated for three Academy Awards for ""Best Screenplay"", ""Best Director"" and ""Best Foreign Language Film"".

The film gained notoriety as it had the reputation for inspiring political violence and tactics from the film were copied by the Black Panthers and Provisional Irish Republican Army.  The film was banned in France for five years and the original American and British releases cut any scenes involving the French torture of Muslim Algerians.

But the film was also looked at as useful for training as the film was shown as part of counter-insurgency classes in the 60's. Shown in Israel by the Left-Wing to show that Israel's occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was futile.  And in 2003, the film was screened at the Pentagon with a flier for the screening being circulated as ""How to win a battle against terrorism and lose the war of ideas. Children shoot soldiers at point-blank range. Women plant bombs in cafes. Soon the entire Arab population builds to a mad fervor. Sound familiar? The French have a plan. It succeeds tactically, but fails strategically. To understand why, come to a rare showing of this film.""

For years, people only had access to pirated copies of the film and censored versions until restoration was done in 1999 and was obtained by Rialto Pictures for distribution.  The Criterion Collection released ""The Battle of Algiers"" with a special 3-disc DVD set (released back in 2004) that is to say the least, is fantastic and possibly one of the most complete, in-depth Criterion releases I have yet seen to date.  It's important to note that in this film, there were no news or documentary footage used in the making of the film.  The mass crowds and everything you seen for the film was shot by Pontecorvo and crew.

The significance of director Gillo Pontecorvo's ""The Battle of Algiers"" is that it was released in theaters three years after the Algerian war where tensions were still strong, Pontecorvo's ability to recreate situations that transpired during 1954-1962 and most importantly, to have one of the largest mass crowds used in a film.  It's relevance today is because in this film we see children becoming soldiers, innocent Muslims who had nothing to do with destruction being targeted by civilians, women dressed as normal citizens planting bombs in civilian areas such as cafe's and dance clubs but also the French soldiers who rounded up people they believe were insurgents and tortured them. Pontecorvo wanted to show the perspective from both sides of the war.  The side of the Muslim Algerians who fought for their independence and had enough of their people being killed or held by French authorities and on the French side, the civilians rooting for the military trying to stop the violence brought by the Muslim terrorists.

To say the least, the film is quite epic and what was accomplished by Pontecorvo is amazing and what the Criterion Collection was able to do with this DVD release is simply fantastic!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Battle of Algiers"" is presented in black and white with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1.  According to the Criterion Collection, the film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio and was supervised by director of photography, Marcello Gatti.  The new HD transfer was created on C-Reality from a 35mm restored fine-grain master positive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.  The blacks are nice and deep and although there are scenes that are high in grain, the picture quality for this 40+ year-old film is fantastic.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital mono.  According to Criterion, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical print track and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The film is center channel driven but I chose to have my receiver set the audio for stereo on all channels, which I found to be fantastic for those with a 5.1 or 7.2 or higher setup.  Audio is presented in French and Arabic.

Subtitles are in English and subtitles are nice and clear with a black stroke around the character type.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Prior to buying this set, one of the reasons that I held out was because I thought it was simply a DVD set that focused on violence and really, I didn't know if this was a film that I could get into.

Prior to watching ""The Battle of Algiers"", I had no knowledge of the French-Algerian war nor ""The Battle of Algiers"" but just reading from critics and cinemaphiles writing about how it's a must-see film but for years, I skipped over it because I simply was not in the mood to engage in a film about revolutions or terrorism because I see this on the daily news everyday.

But I decided that enough was enough, no more waiting and it was time to give the ""The Battle of Algiers"" a try and make the purchase.  It took me about a week to go through this 3-DVD box set of ""The Battle of the Algiers"" and I have to say that this is one of the most complete, must-buy sets for those who are fans of Criterion Collection films.  I found it to be absolutely gripping and its filmmaking and the various shots and the mass crowds that Pontecorvo was able to get on film is amazing.  I have never seen any film like it in my life and to think that what was featured was without a use of a green or blue screen and any CG work is incredible.

But if anything, Pontecorvo's film is those type of films that makes you think... can you blame either side?  No one is innocent in this film.  Both sides have committed atrocities towards each other.  But what is important is what The Criterion Collection has done for the viewer and that is include many supplements that are a half hour to more than an hour long and to absorb information coming from those who filmed the movie, those who were involved and incarcerated during the war, the French soldiers who were involved int he war and then to hear from other filmmakers of the importance of the film.  This is a solid release!  Again, this is a significant release that I'm really impressed with and I hope that the Criterion Collection considers this film for a Blu-ray re-release. ""The Battle of Algiers"" was relevant then as it is now.  And as so many have told me once before and now I'm proud to say it now, The Criterion Collection's release of ""The Battle of Algiers"" is highly recommended!",1260316800,2,10586,4.9863325740318905
506934,5,6302737249,"The Bottom Line:

A riveting war film and an incredibly compelling treatise on de-colonialism, The Battle of Algiers is a fascinating film which is no less interesting or topical today than it was upon its release.",1233014400,2,214,4.944444444444445
506974,3,6302737249,"I recently saw this movie and for me it has some interesting features but is far from being the ultimate war movie it was supposed to be.  Maybe at the time it was released it had something new to tell but after more than 40 years I think its sensibilities are dated.

I do not like the glorification of violence in the name of leftist politics, even though their cause could be considered as just the methods the Algerian FNLN guerrilla used were despicable, the cowardly murder of police and army personnel and the bombing of civilians is far from heroic.  We can empathize with the anger of the Algerian people at being dominated by a white French minority but resorting to criminal brutality was unjustified even if at the end the aims were achieved and indeed Algeria won its independence (more because of negative political sentiment in France that ultimately sapped the moral of the troops and led the nation to finally give up in this struggle).  The director clearly aims at creating a sympathy with the urban guerrillas true to sixties sensibilities at a time when Che Guevara and Ho Chi Min were considered heroes by the young and the leftist inclined intellectuals and lay people.  Today we are seeing the devastating effects these so called heroes created in their societies bringing not the final redemption of the masses but brutal dictatorships and ultimately economic failure of their economies and now we have only Cuba openly professing Communism and supporting guerrilla groups such as the soon to be defunct FARC in Colombia.  So I do not support left wing freedom fighters knowing what we know today but in the early sixties still the Soviet Union was going strong creating a sixth column around the world aided by the bleeding heart leftist intellectuals and the youth openly professing revolutionary ideas all over the world and movies such as this aided in this aim.

I commend the director (Pontecorvo) in presenting a well balanced character in Col. Mathieu, the French paratroop commander.  Considering the ideological leanings of the film it could have been easy to present a caricature of a nazi sadist but we are given a more profound character that indeed addresses the tough necessities in fighting a dirty war but with a sense of morality.

I cannot root for the French either as they were only trying to preserve a colonial rule that by the time was outdated and in moral bankrupcy, of course they were tough and at times brutal but the enemy did not give them other choice, that is the sad truth of fighting urban guerrillas, you cannot recognize the combatants from the civilians and to find them you have to bend the rules of decency and civilized warfare.  Thus we have torture being used as a necessity, spies, informers and traitors also were used in order to reach the safe houses and hiding places the guerrillas used and to ultimately find the few die-hards that are hiding among the society that only wants to be left in peace to resume normal life,  this is the essence of dirty war that leftist groups and freedom fighters have forced armies to use.

The movie was well crafted, the style was almost a documentary, the use of native actors gives it some authenticity.  Being a little bit pedantic I found it rather annoying to listen to the dialogs in Italian as the movie took place in French speaking Algeria and I would certainly have preferred to see it in French for authenticity.

In summation this was a good movie, not very revealing, its outdated with current sensibilities but the hype surrounding it does not match with the quality or impact of this movie.",1224633600,7,3614,4.752396166134186
506975,5,6302737249,"There are few films with the power of The Battle Of Algiers. It is a film based on real events that gives you, the audience, the feel of those events actually unfolding before your eyes, which is a rarity to say the least. What is even rarer is what makes this film so good: it is perhaps the most successful documentary approach recreation of actual events ever produced.

Perhaps the biggest key to the documentary approach of the film is the fact that the actors do not seem to be acting. Often it is the very fact that actors do seems to be acting that can kill the reality of a film like this one yet this represents one of the successful attempts at using not just actors but non-actors to create a seamless whole. In fact one of the best decisions made by Gillo Pontecorvo was to cast Saadi Yacef who was directly involved in the real events to effectively play himself. The advantage of this is that it adds an even greater degree of verisimilitude to the film and its approach.

The documentary approach is in fact the very key to the success of The Battle Of Algiers. The cinematography wobbles, zooms and frames in the way that a documentary film would if filming these events as they were taking place and gives the film the visual reference of a documentary. The result of this is the feeling in the midst of riots, shooting, bombings, meetings, torturing etc. In short the film gives the feeling of being in the midst of a modern revolution from both sides of it.

In fact it is the very fact that The Battle Of Algiers covers both sides that makes the film stand-out. It is true that the filmmakers have an obvious bias for the FLN, yet one must look deeper into the film. Despite that bias the film pulls no punches on the morals of terrorism. The very fact that is shows shooting and bombings up close and personal and the aftermaths as well in perhaps the single best example of this. Neither side be it the FLN with their terrorist attacks of the French with their paratroopers using torture is portrayed as the definite good guys or bad guys to put it in more conventional, literal terms. The film proves that one point of view is as valid as the other, something rather unique to this film. The bias is for the FLN and the journey of Ali La Pointe from average Algerian to revolutionary yet the fact is that the film shows both sides. The point of this: nobody is right yet nobodies wrong and both sides of any conflict must understand this. That fact alone makes the film as relevant today as it was forty plus years ago.

Another strong element of the film is its rather sparse score. The score was a collaboration between films core master Ennio Morricone and Pontecorvo and it is proof of the old saying less is more. The score provided emotional clout to an all ready emotionally charged film from the almost thunderous paratrooper theme to the heartbreaking piece used in the aftermath of both the French and FLN bombings. In fact that latter piece alone makes clear the intent of those scenes: human suffering in universal no matter which side of a conflict you are on. It is a unique score for a unique film.

The Battle Of Algiers is a unique film in many ways. From the verisimilitude of its cast to its documentary approach and unique view of modern revolutions and terrorism, few films can match the sheer power and realism of this film. It is this uncommon aspect that makes the film unique even some four decades after it was made. For anyone seeking a unique insight into modern terrorism or seeking a fine example of how a film can bring history to life after the event I recommend The Battle Of Algiers without hesitation.

I rate The Battle of Algiers among the best films ever made and lament the fact it is so (suspiciously) difficult to find a copy of it in the United States today. It is painfully realistic, fact-filled, horrifying, and packed with disturbing lessons in the politics of conflicting cultures that have never been more relevant than they are right now. As it tells the story of dogged French efforts half a century ago to maintain possession of Algeria, and equally tenacious Algerian struggles to attain independence, The Battle of Algiers has a cast of hundreds (and thousands more extras) that keeps its story going at an extremely fast pace. Here among the countless acts of assassination, terrorism, and outright murder, often for revenge and against innocent civilians, is human drama anchored in history and reality. Some of the incidents this motion picture bluntly depicts will send chills down the spines of even the most hardened veteran of sensationalized, special effect heavy Hollywood war films. And of course anyone would have to be blind not to see ironclad parallels between the French experiences in North Africa and the American situation in Iraq today.

Defeating a guerrilla army when it is fighting for its own homeland is extremely difficult. Only the British in Malaya were successful in defeating Communist forces, and that was more than 40 years ago and under very different circumstances that Americans face in Iraq.
In the Battle of Algiers, the French seem to be winning, but of course, de Gaulle realized by 1958 or so that, indeed, Algeria was not a part of metropolitan France after all.
I come away from the Battle of Algiers each time thinking how absolutely futile it is for a colonial or foreign power to try to impose its will and its political system on another society and culture. Those people being suppressed will always find a way to fight back. It may take a generation or two, but it is inevitable.

506981,5,6302737249,"One of the best political films ever, about the 1954-1957 uprising of Algiers against French colonial rule. As the film shows, the uprising was brutally crushed, but the seeds of independence had already been sown, and in 1960 a new uprising, covering all Algeria, would rise up, and the country would become independent two years later. The French colonists, who numbered more than a million and who had lived in Algeria for more than a century, would be expelled afterwards, marking a complete defeat for France. Made in 1965, with financing by the Algerian independent government, it is nevertheless surprisingly fair in some aspects. It shows the brutal terror tactics employed by the FLN (the main Algerian liberation group) like bombing bars and discos used by the Europeans. It also shows the French colonel in charge of suppressing the revolt (played by the only professional actor in the cast) in a quite positive light: in a film without true heroes, he is probably the most sympathetic character, competent and self-effacing, even if he doesn't flinch in using torture to crush the revolt (torture being in his mind the only method to destroy the FLN's cell structure). And, perhaps inadvertently, by showing the terror tactics used by the FLN, it suggests the oppressive, antidemocratic nature of the future independent government of Algeria. Overall, one of the must-see films in every cinephile list (and in any person interested in the politics of the region or in antiterror tactics).",1195948800,4,1500,5.1016260162601625

Shot in black and white, the cinematography is just tops and the story is quite easy to follow. The acting here is quite convincing, well-done.
Be advised of the graphic violence of a nature that we don't see much in Western films.

507004,5,6302737249,"Gillo Pontecorvo is one of the most intense of the so-called ""political directors"", and he has been described as a ""volatile maverick"".  A former Communist and resistance fighter (WWII) himself, his first foray into directing films was as a documentarian; much like Werner Herzog. He won some acclaim for his film KAPO (1959) with Susan Strasberg. It was not uncommon of him to spend several years doing research for one of his films. He turned down twice as many films as he directed, only credited with 20 films from 1953-1997. After THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS (1966), he went on to direct QUEIMADA (BURN) (1969) with Marlon Brando. Another fine film came later, OGRO (1979), about resistance during the Franco regime. But oddly only ALGIERS and BURN are available in DVD or VHS.

Pontecorvo could have been a film composer as well, and again like Herzog he spent a long time working on the film scores with whatever composer he hired. For ALGIERS he hired the young Ennio Morricone, and then fought with him the entire time. They did come up with a very haunting and subdued score however. Pontecorvo was working initially with Franco Solinas on a script called PARA, for paratrooper. The main character was a European who got caught up in the Algerian war for independence. Paul Newman was being considered for the part. But then Yacef Saadi, the former FLN leader, came to them with his script about the Algerian struggle -but they had to rewrite it. It was presented mostly as a political manifesto. Interestingly, Saadi was hired as a technical consultant, and got to play himself in the film.

Pontecorvo was very fond of the Neo-realist cinema of post-WWII Italy, the films of Rossellinin, De Sica, and Fellini. He especially liked BICYCLE THIEF (1948). He decided to cast mostly non-actors for THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS. When he wrote a character, he had an image of their face in his mind. The Algerian who is being tortured in the opening scene of the film was a petty thief in real life, but the director ""liked his look"". The condemned criminal in the prison sequence, who yelled ""Vive Algeria!"" was actually a condemned criminal who later was guillotined. He only used one professional actor in ALGIERS -the French actor Jean Martin to play Col. Mathieu. Brahim Hadjudj, who played the street thug and boxer, Ali La Pointe, had a great face. His piercing looks seemed to burn holes in the camera lens, much like a young Brando in VIVA ZAPATA (1952) -a classic film directed by Elia Kazan about another revolution, shot in black and white, using many unknown faces; like the uncredited Henry Silva.

In 1965, Pontecorvo, squired about the Casbah by Saadi, was treated like a hero; all doors were open to him. It really was a remarkable achievement to film this movie only three years after the Algerians had won their independence. The movie was banned in France for over 10 years. At the Venice Film Festival, the entire French delegation walked out because of this film. In 1974, director Louis Malle screened the film in four theaters, and it became an instant classic. THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS (1966) remains a film like none other, a kind of reliving of the Algerian revolution, made with many of the participants. In 2003, the Pentagon screened the movie for our military and civilian ""experts"" in Iraq. The flyer for the screening read, ""How to win a battle against terrorism, and lose the war of ideas.""",1187568000,5,3413,4.7894736842105265
507005,5,6302737249,"Watching this, I could not help but observe how ""Homeric"" the film is -- i.e. both sides, the French general and the FLN leaders, seem to recognize quite distinctly what the broad progression of events will be and say so repeatedly. The general speaks about ""the inevitable phases of revolutionary warfare"", while the Algerians are also quite sure what the next step taken by the French will be at any moment.

The Algerians apparently have to use terrorism to jumpstart the whole process (as the political will in this case seems to require the social will of the populace first), the French have to use torture to get information and so both sides go on provoking each other more and more and the situation escalates. The (real) events unfold(ed) as if in a script, but the movie itself feels realistic, spontaneous, and unscripted. How ironic...

At the outset it is pretty much clear what will follow, both to us and the characters, with the French quelling the rebellion in the short run by sheer military force, but the Algerians eventually winning in the long run through superiority of numbers and patriotic determination. But the characters act as if they have free will, and they do, but not enough to change the bigger flow of events. But maybe that's not what they are interested in, anyway.

I guess that is similar to what the Greek heroes did -- even if they knew exactly when and how they were going to be killed, far from being demotivated by this knowledge, they continued their struggle. Jaffar (played by himself) is the only character who decides in the last minute that saving his life is more important than being blown up for the cause and somehow that decision does not  quite fit the tone of the rest of the movie.

But basically this movie is a good opportunity to reflect on how it is part of a soldier's job to fight even if he knows the end result will not change one bit. And in this case we have soldiers on both sides, even if only side wears uniforms. The label ""terrorists"" does not quite apply, at least after the initial bombings are over.

Another observation is that the documentary-style filmmaking works well here, because the dialogue (or lack of it) complements the visual style. Hollywood has too often in recent years tried to do more ""gritty, authentic"" movies (and this was of course already tried in the 1970s with countless closeups of sweaty faces in ""Dirty Harry"", etc.), but these efforts (like ""Memento"") usually fall short because, even though the picture is grainy and apparently filmed with a Shakicam(TM), the dialogue is the usual Hollywood, Disneyland-esque, schmaltzy, excessively emotional tripe it always is. Form and content have to go together, and they do so beautifully here.

Many of the key scenes have no dialogue at all, while Jean Martin gets to spout fittingly existentialist monologues, perhaps more suited for the stage. But this at all times distances us from the action and keeps us a more or less impartial observer of two sides at war, where the end justifies the means, and the result is clear before the game has even started.",1185235200,5,3106,4.75139146567718
507006,5,6302737249,"My review is based on the film alone, since I have not seen the extras included in the Criterion edition.

This film was commissioned, according to IMDB, by the Algerian government. And yet it is, in my opinion, balanced, nuanced, and complex, not propagandistic. Crimes against innocents are committed by both sides, and are portrayed with the gravitas of a Biblical epic or Greek tragedy. If an objective movie about any revolution could be made, it would look like this. The filmmakers did not preach, did not lead viewers to preordained conclusions based on flimsy caricatures of difficult people. Was Ali La Pointe a hero? Yes, and an anti-hero as well. French Colonel Mathieu was also hero (he was in the Nazi resistance, after all) and anti-hero (he orders torture, but will not call it that). The people of Algeria wanted their independence from France as passionately as the people of India from England and the people of the American colonies from England. Who was a freedom fighter? Who was a terrorist? Jaffar, one of the revolt's leaders, says (I'm paraphrasing) that terrorism is an effective way to begin, but after that the people have to commit to a revolution, and after the revolution is won, the hard work begins.

If current affairs seem to you to be a clear case of right and wrong, black and white, I highly recommend this film. It throws a stark light on the struggle between law-and-order and freedom-and-justice: the two principles do not always live comfortably together. It will remind you of The Godfather, of Citizen Kane . . . and any other film that boldly shows that nobility and barbarity thrive in both the best and the worst of us. As other reviewers, and even the Pentagon, have recently noted, this film is highly relevant to today's world. Not many peoples will welcome, or even tolerate, an occupying force for very long. When they decide to throw off that yoke, the occupying country is in for a very difficult time.",1184630400,7,1957,4.78698224852071

507009,4,6302737249,"This film now being touted as a 'lesson in history' (even though there is little comparason to the Iraq war)it is indeed a lesson in history.

Almost every war/civil war since the Algerian war of independence has been veiwed through the eyes of the Algerian war, even Robert Fisk during the recent Algerian civil war gave us the idea that the civil war was something of a 'continuation' of the initial F.L.N struggle.  It should be kept in mind however, that this film was and always has been the darling of the far left and has little if anything to do with recent Islamist movements.

Regarding the historical lessons there are many to gather, the use of bombing campaigns against civiliam targets (a cafe in one scene) The use of females to carry bombs past checkpoints because the French would ""not dare to search an Algerian woman"" On the part of the French, the enclosing of entire sections of the city turning them into impoverished ghettos, torture to 'gather information', target killing of leaders asuming that this will 'quell the rebellion'

Lessons indeed, not least events that followed in Algeria, how those who fought for independence turned a country into their own personal property, a military that cancelled a legitimate election, lessons indeed not just for Algeria but for Africa and the Middle East.  The same lessons have not been learned Zimbabwae being the perfect example, ex revolutionary turns dictator.

While the film surrounds the life of an ex petty criminal turned revolutionary (how very leftist!) and attention is given to the lives of ordianry people in the Arab quarter, how marriages were conducted under the terrible conditions of near seige and not least how the F.L.N. began to administer their own law within the lawless Arab quater. Little is given to the rural battles where some of the bitterest fighting took place and while many today may think there are some comparasons with the current situation in Iraq please keep in mind, this film along with Land and Freedom was the film to watch if you were a young left wing student it's hardly a blueprint of current conflicts.

An interesing film but would be far more useful if watching wishing to learn something of the struggle for independence and the post independence struggle in what is called the 'developing world', something that continues to this day.",1178841600,4,2355,4.902010050251256
507010,3,6302737249,"If, for some reason, you are a loyal fan of Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 black-and-white ""The Battle of Algiers,"" then your train has definitely come into the station with this release.  (The film, by the way, is an Italian one, though many seem to think it was French.)

What you are buying is the deluxe box, believe me, with all the bells and whistles:  three exhaustively informative disks laden with extras, and a handsomely produced booklet.

The subtitles are available only in English, in white print.  You can remove them and hear only the French, but you cannot get either French or Italian subtitles, or Italian or English audio.  So I guess if you're a polyglot purist, your train has yet to come in.

As for the film itself, you're getting a mixed bag, in my view.  The box proclaims it a film with ""astonishing relevance today"" -- presumably a reference to America's quagmire in Iraq.

Well, the film certainly captures the chaos, confusion, and simple undoability of trying to govern a contrarian people who simply don't want to be governed -- and have access to gunpowder.

One of its central merits is the way in which it limns war as an irretrievably ugly business.  There are some good tense moments, but the pace is jerky overall, and from time to time gets downright tedious (it takes a strictly calendrical approach to the action).  It would have benefited, I feel, from better characterization.

Also: it's hard to symphathize with anything or anybody in the film.  The methods of the insurgents do not render them admirable, much less heroic.  And the French:  is there nothing they won't stoop to?  Yes, in this film, folks, absolutely nobody has the moral high ground; unlike, I submit, our current foray into Mesopotamia, where we are at least trying to do the right thing.  It is for this reason I remain unconvinced about the ""relevance"" today of Pontecorvo's film.

Worse, we are never really told what the insurgents are fighting for, or why. As for the French, what on earth are they going out of their way to hold the property for?  Can they really think it worth the trouble.  Certainly, there are very definite answers to these questions, but you've gotta bring them to the film yourself.

To sum up:  After spending a few attentive hours with this film, I can definitely see while many consider it a worthwhile but not truly great piece of work.  I definitely started getting bored toward the end until the film became a positive chore to watch.  Parts of it struck me as confusing, inept, and even naive.

507011,5,6302737249,"I first saw the fictionalized French, subtitled in English, version of the  Battle of Algiers in the early 1970's when I, along with other like-minded political types, were under the influence of the vanguard role that `third world' national liberation struggles against the imperialist heartland played in world politics. Moreover we were under the influence of Frantz Fanon's concept of the  `cleansing' nature of such struggles on the revolutionary organization and the population, especially compared to the `bought off' workers in the West that were key to classical Marxist thought. Much water has passed over the dam since then in Algeria but it is still fair to say that the Algerian struggle for independence against the hated French occupiers was, in hindsight, still an important liberation struggle to support if not for the same reasons as in my youth.

After a recent viewing of the film what is surprising is that with due regard to differences in time, geography, political conditions and other factors the drama of this film could reflect today's reality in Baghdad, including some aspects of the Islamic political program of the insurgents. Most of the scenes in the film took place in 1957 as the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) initiated various actions including unsupportable acts of individual terror against civilian targets and supportable acts against military targets, a general strike that the French frantically tried to break and on-going urban guerilla warfare against the occupying forces.

Some of the issues raised in film that were capable of making my blood pressure rise then still do so today. The foreign occupation's indifference or hostility to the `natives' and their political wishes. The endless arbitrary searching of houses and persons by the occupiers in order to pacify the population. The escalation of military tactics by both sides as the body counts rise. The ready and refined use of torture by the French occupiers. Moreover, a point not appreciated by this reviewer at his first viewing was that when the seasoned (from Indo-China) professional French Army ratcheted up the ante they were able to destroy, for a time, the urban guerilla infrastructure. But in the end they had to leave, just as the Americans will have to leave Baghdad in defeat. Yes, this all seems very, very familiar.

A point about one of the central characters, Ali. The above-mentioned Fanon in Wretched of the Earth, his most famous work, that chronicles the Algerian struggle highlights the key organizational role of what is commonly called the dregs of society, the theives, pimps and other criminal elements. Marxists use the term lumpenproletariat. Ali as a self-professed and convicted con artist is just such a character. According to Fanon's theory if revolutionary forces can recruit enough Alis then a real 'purified' revolutionary organization can be formed. Naturally that assumes that an Ali, as portrayed in the film, is a true prototype of this kind of recruit. A quick glance at revolutionary history, however,  belies that notion. More frequently this layer of society provides the shock troops of the counterrevolution. Moreover, this is a very unstable base on which to form an organization. There was a reason that the Paris Commune inscribed  `death to thieves' on its banners. The Black Panthers here in America also learned the hard way the difficulties of recruiting (and, more importantly, holding) that layer as they attempted to emulate, among others, the Algerian experience.",1175126400,6,3541,5.234567901234568
507012,5,6302737249,"With an obvious eye toward the ongoing violence in Iraq, the Criterion Collection has remastered Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo's brilliant semi-documentary account of the Algerian uprising against French rule in the 1950s. Even those who have seen the film will want to feast on two extra discs of fascinating background material, including an interview with former counterterrorists Richard Clarke and Michael Sheehan exploring the scary resonance of the film with the present mess in Iraq.

Not that we needed Clarke and Sheehan for a roadmap from Algiers to Iraq. ""The Battle of Algiers"" is so relevant to America's new post-war war that U.S. Special Forces have been screening the film at the Pentagon.

The film's action pivots on a crucial period when a small band of insurgents ratchets the violence upward until they are bombing cafes full of people. The French impose checkpoints, safe zones, and razor-wire fences, but these daily humiliations only anger the people further.

When a battalion of crack paratroopers moves in, the Iraq comparisons get positively uncanny. ""The basis of our job is intelligence,"" says French colonel Mathieu, a super-counterterrorist with the unfeeling gimlet eyes of Vladimir Putin. ""The method: interrogation, conducted in such a way as to ensure we always get an answer."" Out come the electrodes and blowtorches. Captives begin to talk. Names are crossed off an organizational chart.

The case for ruthless counter-terrorism is fresh in Americans' minds now. But it's unusual to hear anyone even derisively acknowledge the logic of terrorism. As a PR stunt, Mathieu trots out a captured terrorist leader for a staged press conference, hoping the insurgent will publicly drip with venom, squandering public sympathy for the movement. But when a young reporter refers to use of bombs in baskets to slaughter innocents as ""cowardly,"" the insurgent's answer is quick and sure: ""Obviously, it would make things easier for us if we had planes. Give us your bombers, sir, and you can have our baskets.""

For the French, too, violence is shown as a chilly flow of choices and ramifications. ""We're neither monsters nor sadists,"" Mathieu says when rumors of prisoner torture reach the Paris press. (Even Jean-Paul Sartre weighs in against the occupation, and Mathieu's ill-concealed disgust at him provides the film's only dust mote of humor). Mathieu tells them it all comes down do one question: Must France stay in Algeria? ""If the answer is yes,"" he says, ""then you must accept the consequences."" He's a loyal and efficient military man, stuck with the dirty job of carrying out politicians' popular platitudes.

It may be a war film, but ""The Battle of Algiers"" has quiet, overwhelming power. The mix of subjective and documentary techniques hold the viewer's trust so authoritatively that many scenes come close to sneaking out of the ""movies I saw"" box in your head to mix with your own memories.

No matter how complicated or fragmented the action becomes, Pontecorvo gets the pace, tone and rhythm exactly right, filling the screen with eloquent details. When a condemned man is tilted onto a guillotine, one of his shoes falls off (later, the same thing happens to a woman as she dragged off the street). When violence erupts, it does so with a startling, open-air crack. A gun slides out of a cloak or a doorway, spits out dry death, and the camera moves on, leaving the audience among the witnesses in the street: ""Did you see that? Oh my God.""

The filmmaker's use of middle distance, his trust in honest audience reaction, puts to shame the close-up, perfumed lap-dances of violence that punctuate even the most high-minded American films.

The film has been accused of romanticizing terrorists, but in Pontecorvo's eyes the story belongs to the insurgents as much as the country. So he lets the camera make charged choices, contrasting the Algerians' earnest, salt-of-the-earth faces with the pasty, blank expressions of the French. Colonel Mathieu and his men might as well be an invading force from Uranus as they march past the children and fruit vendors of the Casbah (they wear camouflage-patterned fatigues, even though there isn't a green or brown patch anywhere in the city).

It's bound to offend some people that Pontecorvo wants the audience to empathize with terrorists, even when they're about to kill people. Empathy, however, is not the same thing as approval. The famous sequence in which three women carry bombs to crowded cafes is a masterpiece of psychological layering. All at once, the women are determined to repay the trust of their superiors, terrified of being discovered, and disgusted at the horror they are about to unleash. One bomber watches a baby lick an ice cream cone as the clock ticks toward doom. Another dances puppet-like near a jukebox, locked in a shell of loneliness and dread. The scene dives into an unfathomable nexus of purpose and coincidence, yet the whole truth seems up there on the screen. That's something that can't often be said about any work of art.",1174348800,6,5059,5.069711538461538

I own it, but as CRITERION DVDs can be a little expensive, I don't wish to urge you to buy it until you see it. I am sure, however, that once you do, you will purchase it. Especially if you are a lover of history or politics. The film has been discussed here at length, and I must admit, they are some of the best reviews I have ever read on DVDs. There are some very intelligent reviews on this particular DVD. I remember first watching this film in a class on Nationalism and Colonialism, while I was an undergraduate at UCLA. This film is great, and I have always remembered the discussion following the film.

The events of the film takes place during the period of the French occupation of Algeria, from 1954-1957. What amazed me about the film is that these are not actors. [Not professional]. This is the real deal here. No manicured nails and chauffer driven stars on this set. The Algerian government intended this film to be as realisitic as possible. Their victory over the French was not going to be some silly parade of stars. No way, this was for prosterity: And the film shows it. The film is done in a documentary style, so that the viewer gets a better feel for the events the would eventually lead to Algeria's independence. There is also an ugly side to the conflict as the French are hell-bent on keeping Algeria. The film is shot in black and white, and this was a very wise decision. It is much better with the grainy black and white than you could ever imagine. Highly recommmend. [Stars: 5+]",1163462400,6,1616,4.368770764119601
507055,5,6302737249,"Almost every war movie stacks the deck. Enemy soldiers wear heavy boots, are unshaven, speak in accents and die in large numbers at the end. Heroes are played by actors who get $10 to $20 million a film; of course they get to go home and pick up their lives where they left off. Moral complexity? Not that you can notice --- war movies are like Westerns, just with better weapons.

Political movies are no better. The filmmaker --- if not the studio --- is on one ""side"" or other. The movie is a function of its point-of-view.

What if there were a political film without a hero? A war movie that doesn't take sides? Would that be a snooze?

""Battle of Algiers"" is that film. It is not only one of the greatest movies about conflict, it is one of the best movies about political conflict. In fact, it is one of the greatest films ever made --- so great that no one has been able to steal from it.

""Battle of Algiers"" is rooted in fact. It covers the period from 1954 to 1957, when Algeria was a colony of France and Algeria's National Liberation Front led uprisings in Algiers. French troops were sent in. The revolt was crushed.

But the movie is not the record of a victory or a defeat. It's about what makes people cry ""Enough"" and do something about it. It's about the cost of conflict and the loss of innocent life. And, in the end, it's about the tide of history --- in this case, about what may be the inevitable result of colonial occupation.

The movie looks like a documentary, shot in black-and-white by a cameraman who flinches when bombs go off.

In fact, there is not one frame of historical footage in the film.

As for actors, there are 150 amateurs in the film. The only professional is the French Colonel. The Algerian boy who plays Ali La Pointe was an illiterate street kid with no acting experience. Journalists and French soldiers were played by tourists.

As for taking sides, Pontecorvo doesn't. He doesn't even have a designated hero. He's following a ""collective protagonist"" on the Algerian side and the power of France --- personified by Colonel Mathieu, who was a Resistance fighter during World War II --- on the other.

For all that, ""Battle of Algiers"" is a hugely controversial film. When it was released in 1967, it was widely honored --- it won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay (Gillo Pontecorvo and Franco Solinas), Best Director and Best Foreign Language Film. It was also banned for years in France after some theaters showing it were bombed. For a decade or so, it was shown --- with noisy projectors and sheets for screens --- in the Middle East as a training film for insurgents. And in 2003, the Directorate for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict at the Pentagon screened the film as a possible scenario of what American troops might face in Iraq.

The plot: Ali La Pointe is a petty criminal in jail for a minor offense. There he sees an execution of a fellow Algerian whose last words are ""Allah is great! Long live Algeria!"" When he's released, Ali is recruited by the National Liberation Front, which has developed an effective new tactic --- making war on French civilians.

This splits the viewer down the middle. It's very hard to cheer the French, but what can you say about people who put bombs in coffee shops and blow up high school kids? Does the end justify the means? If not, how do you effectively break the yoke of colonial oppression?

For all the action scenes --- and ""Battle of Algiers"" has some of the most astonishing street fights and scenes of ""terrorism"" ever filmed --- it's the conflict of ideas that's most stinging. Here's a news conference with a captured freedom fighter:

Journalist: M. Ben M'Hidi, don't you think it's a bit cowardly to use women's baskets and handbags to carry explosive devices that kill so many innocent people?

Ben M'Hidi: And doesn't it seem to you even more cowardly to drop napalm bombs on defenseless villages, so that there are a thousand times more innocent victims? Of course, if we had your airplanes it would be a lot easier for us. Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets.

Most of all, there is a compelling argument about the wisdom anbd effectiveness of torture. Here's the leader of the French Army in Algiers:

Col. Mathieu: The word ""torture"" doesn't appear in our orders. We've always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then they may talk. So, the organization has already had the time it needs to render any information useless. What type of interrogation should we choose, the one the courts use for a murder case, that drags on for months?... Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.

The music is by Ennio Morricone, who scored Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"" --- better believe it will haunt and agitate you. And when you see what happens at the end of the film, you'll know why I tell you that your heart level will definitely elevate.

The film is in French. The subtitles are large and clear. But you don't need to hear the sound to understand the plot. Understanding the message is much more difficult. Indeed, forty years after ""Battle of Algiers"" was released, its issues are the biggest international challenge we face.

Quite the contrary!

Given events on and since 9/11, Iraq, Madrid, London, Lebanon -- the West's global struggle against Islam -- this film is more important and relevant today than ever.

There is one sequence in particular in which three Arab women disguise themselves as Europeans in order to slip bombs past the French colonial checkpoints and plant them in locations where they will kill the maximum number of Europeans.

507057,5,6302737249,"One of the most realistic war movies ever made, Battle of Algiers is a must see for those that would like a deeper insight into revolutionary mentality and/or expert film making. From actual FLN rebels used in the film to the scenes being shot on location, Gillo Pontecorvo is able to combine a terrifying event into a cinematic masterpiece.

As noted plenty of times this film is not a journalistic account of the Algerian liberation or the events that preceded it: this movie is a faithful reenactment of the battle in all of its brutality. The atrocities of a revolution are showed from all sides involved: it is no wonder that the public's opinion of the film in this day and age is favorable, regardless of the viewer's background.

Despite some of the ill-informed reviews that claim the opposite, this story truly is the most unbiased account of any war to date. All sides involved are at fault for the devastation the war caused regardless of whether or not the French had a right to hold onto Algeria in the first place (an Algeria that wanted to be free). French viewers shouldn't have a problem with the film in modern day as most regard the battle of Algiers as a catastrophe. Be prepared to see both French and Algerians alike reverting to acts of barbarism in a fight of ideology and flesh (from torture to the killing of civilians, the fight for freedom and the fight for control both have its cost, the movie shows this beautifully).

The movie follows around a few known rebels such as Ali La Pointe of the FLN as they use every force imaginable to separate Algeria from the French government. Most of the scenes are shot in the Algiers' Casbah, a highly dense Arab Casbah with a community of thousands of Algerians. The scenes are beautiful in a realistic way one typically sees in only documentaries.

And yet on the opposite side of the war we follow the renowned French Colonel Phillipe Mathieu, a decorated and highly intelligent paratrooper. Ali La Pointe is superb - believably fighting for a cause he believes in - while Colonel Mathieu reasonably states in the film that he must achieve victory by any means necessary, and yet he's still portrayed as human. Mathieu explains to the press how, if the French people want, he'll gladly leave Algeria but since a war is what they want he'll humbly do his duty. Jean Martin's (Mathieu) performance is so good that one would find it surprising that he did not win the academy award for the role.

On par with the scenery the music is both intense as well as exciting, treating Battle of Algiers with the proper respect it deserves. The music is of significant note though because it's so emotionally engaging: Middle Eastern sounds supplement the highly suspenseful movie while not overpowering the movie by striving to be better than it.

In Battle of Algiers everything that should be in a good movie is present while we also have a number of unique elements. The realism of Battle of Algiers is extremely unparalleled and the acting (performed by average people for the most part), is superb!

507058,4,6302737249,"Well, if you're a history buff, this is a great flick to add to your collection. I would say that the two most underappreciated aspects of this film are timing, for the benefit of the viewer, what is going on in the world at that point, and secondly, cuo bono, who profits, who made the film?

So let me repeat, it's an excellent film, done in the documentary style of the hand held camera relied upon in the opening scenes of ""Private Ryan"" and ""Blow"" to give it a more 'you are there' sense. (And if you're like me, probably scared the hell out of you in Spielberg's ""Ryan."")

So at that time of the world, the French had been disenfranchised as a world power. France had fallen in 17 days to the Nazis, the so-called 'Resistance' was riddled with informers, German sympathizers and quislings, and a few years after that, the French Army was decimated at Dien Bien Phu (""Hell in a Very Small Place"") so it was looking forward to holding on to what it had.

Unfortunately, what it had in place was Algeria. Again the timing for colonial powers had really come to an end for all the nations including England and the U.S., although England and the U.S. managed to preserve some of their dignity from the Plantation Owner mentality and just quietly left the room. So to speak.

So the Algerian people began resistance, bloody resistance and then open warfare in the guise of the FLN, the organization dubbed (by the French) as a terrorist cell of little consequence. (Hey. Weren't we terrorists a couple of hundred years ago?)

So that's the time in which the two forces collide and the reasons why. For one, self-determination; for the other, the end of an era.

The cuo bono part is that the film is commissioned by the Algerian government. Wow. What does that mean? Remember Roger Daltry's voice "". . . here's to the new boss, same as the old boss?"" I'm not saying it isn't, as it proclaims, an even handed view of the conflict. But how would you know? As an aside, it's the same feeling I get when someone directs me to a really straightforward website which ends in 'dotgov.'

But it seems to be a fair view of the conflict. Good film making. It won that year's Venice Film Festival. If I thought there was a text or script driven flaw in it, it would be that there's a two year gap at the end in which the voiceover, addressing the victory of the French Foreign Legion, says words to the effect that the FLN disappeared for two years and then no one knows how it came back but it did and was victorious. Nobody knows? See my comments on dot.gov.

See it. Worthwhile. Good history. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1146355200,5,2612,4.449790794979079
507113,5,6302737249,"The Battle of Algiers is an amazingly relevant movie for the times which we are now living in. The Battle of Algiers investigates the insurrection in Algiers by the FLN against French colonial rule, and documents the process of the recruiting of an insurrectionist, the creation of a terrorist organisation, the initial terror campaign targeting the police and representatives of the government, the authorities response and the escalation by both parties culminating in bombing campaigns targeting civilian populations.

What I did find surprising was the impartial portrayal of the French military intervention. Instead of being portrayed as monsters, the French paratroopers are shown as utterly pragmatic in their understanding of the forces that are arrayed against them and the actions which they must be willing to do to shutdown the rebellion. Actions which include the torture of suspects to gain information on the terrorist cells, information which they know will ultimately lead them to the FLN leadership, who must be captured if the insurrection is ever to be defeated.

A key example of this even handed treatment is in the character of the French Paratroop Colonel. A soldier who had fought with the French resistance in World War 2 and who had been defeated in the French Vietnamese conflict, the Colonel is fully aware of the immorality of his actions, but also knows that if the insurrection is to be defeated then these methods are necessary. As he explains to the assembled press ""Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.""

Ultimately the movie shows the futility of trying to enforce control by military means upon a population whose sympathies remain with the insurrectionists, a population who will comply with your orders only long enough to reorganize and prepare another revolt.",1145059200,8,1867,5.216666666666667

To me, it very much seems like a government film so I was not surprised that the Algerian leadership requisitioned it 40 years ago. The FLN is presented as a force of goodness as they declare war not only on the French but on tobacco, alcohol, and crime as well. The main character, Ali La Pointe, bears a physical and striking personality resemblance to Mohammed Atta. That anyone would construe him a hero is most telling. The melodrama is completed when the producers play forlorn camp music after French colonialists bomb an apartment building, but play nothing when French police are shot and knifed. The film is an excellent testament of France's decline as a nation and their people's loss of political will. They have descended into a permanent Vichy state. The paratroop general correctly stated that the real battle lied with the press and their manipulation of public perception. The same thing could be said of America both during and after Vietnam. The film foreshadowed much of what was to come. In retrospect, perhaps colonialism was not that bad based on what Algeria has turned into today.",1143676800,17,1242,4.808411214953271

Even though Gillo Pontecorvo's film was made in 1966 and documents events that took place in Algiers four years earlier, little has changed in terms of the mindset, structure, strategy and implementation by terrorist organizations, almost as if they've been in a vacuum all these years; indeed, this is the major cause of the ""Arab Predicament"" today. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, it would seem this film is more documentary than cinematic fiction, and with Marcello Gatti's grainy B&W photography (many scenes filmed with a hand-held camera), this impression is not that far off the mark. Since the struggle for independence from France was so fresh in the minds of most Algerians, the participants in the actual events were used in the film, and once Pontecorvo and his team recreated the atmosphere and visuals, the emotions of the people were ignited again and suddenly they were no longer acting. While THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS does take a position on the conflict, Pontecorvo is remarkably even handed in his approach and does not shy away from difficult questions, but confronts them with brutal clarity and honesty. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is an intense, powerful experience, and Ennio Morricone's subdued but emotive score gives the images a resonance that will haunt the viewer long after they've dissolved into closing credits.",1139356800,8,1479,5.141078838174274

Now that the U.S. is fighting a popular insurgency in Iraq, this film should be required viewing for all Americans. The French, who were trying to subdue Algerian nationalism, eventually adopted torture as a means of ending the revolt. Despite such extreme measures, Algeria won its independence. Before the French admitted defeat, many people died from terrorist bombings and indiscriminate street violence. The Algerians first targeted policemen, then moved to civilians. This violence led to French reprisals, both terrorist and military. And on and on, as wars of this kind go. We are given a fly-on-the wall view of a city going through hell. The story mostly focuses on the Muslim characters leading the rebellion. Although the film sympathizes with the nationalists, it does not celebrate them. All the male leads in this movie, whether French or Algerian, are pretty cold-blooded characters. The movie might evoke comparisons to a recent film such as Spielberg's Munich, but with less dialogue and no attempts at humor or real character development. The figures in The Battle of Algiers, unlike those in Munich, never doubt the validity of their beliefs or the efficacy of their actions. In short, this is an excellent movie.

to fight for independence and self government.

The Algerians led by Ali La Pointe, a violent, grown up street urchin played by Brahim Hadjadj and Djafar, the brains behind the movement played by Yacef Saadi lead their charges on a campaign of terror bombing and assassination of the local gendarmerie.  The French counter with the disciplined and principalled Colonel Mathieu played by Jean Martin.  The Colonel has been given a free reign by the French government to quell the bloody disturbance.  He finds it necessary to resort to torture in an attempt to uncover the infrastructure of the F.L.N.

The killing on both sides is chronicled by some excellent black and white cinematography in the streets of Algiers.  The film, commissioned by the Algerian government is a testimonial to the martyrs whose impassioned and relentless efforts ultimately led to independence in 1962.",1134950400,6,1486,5.258474576271187

Director Gillo Pontecorvo's choice of using mostly non-professional actors was both a blessing and a curse. The unfamiliar faces helped create more of a ""realistic feel"" the film is known for, but many times the acting is laughable, taking the viewer out of the film entirely. The film's best quality is the nice location shooting, and it's universal belief of the powers of revolution. Unfortunately the quasi-documentary style never sustains itself throughout the film and it becomes a rather unrealized picture of political cinema.

Although this film has repeatedly been recommended to me, I have hesitated watching it as I didn't think a documentary in French (with English subtitles) would be that captivating.  I was surprised by how riveted I was to this film.

One of the striking parts of this film was the reliance on torture to get information from the resistance movement.  After seeing pictures from Abu Ghraib, these scenes are especially haunting.  Even though the comments made by the French paratrooper colonel regarding ""interrogation"" make some sense, I could not escape the feeling of unease at the use of such tactics.

Throughout the film, I found myself understanding more and more of the anguish on each side of the struggle.  I would highly recommend watching this film.",1127347200,6,895,4.926666666666667

507204,5,6302737249,"""The Battle of Algiers"" is a film with an agenda. Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo plainly displays his Marxist, anti-colonial sympathies in this landmark of political cinema about the pivotal years in Algeria's struggle for independence from France. Style and suspense don't suffer for the politics, though. ""The Battle of Algiers"" was shot in beautiful neo-realist black-and-white, on location in Algiers' casbah. The film builds real suspense every time we wait for a bomb to explode, and we watch the fight for the loyalties of Algiers' Arab population with apprehension. The story is based on the memoirs of Saadi Yacef, a commander in Algeria's nationalist National Liberation Front's (FLN) guerilla forces in the 1950s, written while he was in prison in France. Yacef plays El-Hadi Jaffar in the film, who is essentially himself. Some details and persons have been changed, but ""The Battle of Algiers"" is basically true. To clarify, Algeria was not a French colony, protectorate, or mandate. It was legally part of France, which made it difficult for France to extricate itself. The film is in Arabic and French with optional English subtitles.

Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) is an illiterate petty criminal who takes up the FLN's cause in 1954 while serving time in prison with political prisoners. The FLN's goal is self-determination for Algerians, economic opportunity for all, and to be an arbiter of culture on the side. When La Pointe gets out of prison, he begins work for El-Hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef), an FLN chief in Algiers, who organizes a series of attacks on French police officers. The French react by sealing off the Arab districts and requiring residents to go through check points. But the FLN's attacks only escalate. In 1957, the French military arrives in force. Lieutenant Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) is given the responsibility of destroying the FLN's insurgency in Algiers. Recognizing the futility of the French effort up to that point, he determines that the only way to end the terrorist attacks is to eliminate the FLN chiefs. Mathieu unleashes Operation Champagne on the Casbah, arresting anyone suspected of FLN affiliation and torturing him until he reveals the names of others...until he has every name.

For political propaganda , ""The Battle of Algiers"" is surprisingly even-handed. Because the filmmakers were, themselves, advocates of political violence, ""The Battle of Algiers"" doesn't condemn violence. It condemns colonialism. As Saadi Yacef said in a recent interview, ""There was violence on both sides. Torture on one side, and bombs on the other. In fact, it was a stalemate. History really won the war, in deciding for our independence."" The film's bias is in what it left out. Director Gillo Pontecorvo ignores the plight and very existence of Algeria's ""pieds-noirs"" population, as the European ""colonists"" were called. The film would have us believe that the FLN had universal support among Algerians and that the Europeans were all decadent, racist oppressors. In fact, most of the pieds-noirs were poor or lower middle class and had been in Algeria for generations. Many lived among the Algerian Arabs. Only about 5% of the pieds-noirs were affluent. 90,000 Algerians served in the French army. When Algeria finally won its independence in 1962, over a million pieds-noirs and pro-French Algerians (10% of the nation's population) were forced to flee to France with only what they could carry, creating the largest refugee population in Europe since World War II. I mention this simply to point out that, whatever one thinks of the FLN's cause, their ideals were somewhat elastic. Saadi Yacef is now a Senator in Algeria, where, in the 1990s, the FLN suppressed the growing power of the majority fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in a bloody civil war. The fight for Algeria has always been about power, not populism.

The Pentagon famously screened ""The Battle of Algiers"" for some of its staff in 2003 at the suggestion of the Directorate for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict. Invitations to the screening proclaimed ""How to win a battle against terrorism and lose the war of ideas."" The folks at the Pentagon were apparently trying to apply the lessons of French Algeria to the United States' involvement in Iraq. Hmm. The French-Algerian War does indeed remind me of the Iraqi invasion, but not the years depicted in this film. It reminds me of the first decade or so of the conflict, when the French wouldn't admit they were at war, much less that they had already lost the war. In retrospect, people may wonder if the Pentagon's discussion of ""The Battle of Algiers"" focused on the insurgents or on Colonel Mathieu's methods. Mathieu, who is a composite of several French officers, most notably Colonels Bigeard, Godard, and Trinquier, was expected to put down an uprising and then criticized for using torture to do it. He states flatly, ""Should France stay in Algeria? If your answer is still yes, then you must accept all the consequences."" The trouble is that Mathieu's point was moot by that time. His methods allowed France to win a battle in a war it had already lost.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2004 3-disc set): Disc 1 contains the film and a ""Production Gallery"", which is a slide show of on-set photos and movie posters with intertitles instead of captions, as well as 2 Theatrical Trailers: the original 1966 trailer (4 minutes) and a new trailer for the American re-release (2 minutes). Disc 2, entitled ""Pontecorvo and the Film"", includes 3 features: ""Gillo Pontecarvo: The Dictatorship of Truth"" (37 minutes) is a 1992 documentary narrated by critic Edward Said about Pontecorvo's films, career, and how his life informed his films. There are interviews with Pontecorvo and collaborators, and much time is spent analyzing why the director doesn't make movies anymore. ""Marxist Poetry: The Making of The Battle of Algiers"" (50 minutes) was produced in 2004 for inclusion on this DVD. It discusses making the film, from writing, through production, post-production and the film's reception, with interviews of Pontecorvo, his biographer Irene Bignardi, critics, and collaborators. In ""Five Directors"" (16 minutes), Julian Schnabel, Mira Nair, Spike Lee, Oliver Stone, and Stephen Soderbergh, in separate interviews, talk about the power of the film's style and themes. The documentaries are in Italian, French, and English with English subtitles.

Disc 3, ""The Film and History"", includes 4 features: ""Remembering History"" (1 hour, 8 min.) is a new documentary about the French-Algerian war, focusing on the battle of Algiers. It includes interviews with Saadi Yacef, Zohra Drif-Bitat, who was an FLN bomber, historians Dr. Hugh Roberts, Sir Alistaire Horne and Benjamin Stora, among others. Highly recommended to anyone seeking some background in the French-Algerian conflict. (English and French with English subtitles) ""Etats-d'Armes"" (29 min.) is part of a 2002 French documentary that includes interviews with several French military officers who carried out the controversial policies in Algeria, as well as those who opposed it. They frankly discuss the use of torture and their views of the FLN. Highly recommended. (French with English subtitles) In ""A Case Study"" (24 min.), Christopher Isham of ABC News leads a discussion with former National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism Richard Clarke and former State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism Michael Sheelan in which they talk about terrorism and torture in the film and today. Interesting insight into the mindset of current American policies toward terrorism. ""Return to Algiers"" (1 hour) is a 1992 Italian television program in which director Gillo Pontecarvo returned to Algeria in an attempt to understand the social and political climate there following the FIS' success in elections. Includes an interview with President Mohamed Boudiaf, who was assassinated shortly thereafter. (Italian and Arabic with English Subtitles)",1120608000,27,8020,5.272300469483568
507205,5,6302737249,"I have probably seen this film a hundred times.  Back in the 1960s and early 1970s, socialist youth groups, Black student organizations, Arab liberation supporters, and radical student groups as well as lovers of art film seemed to show this film everywhere I went.  I can remember cleaning up pop corn from meeting halls and classrooms from Boston to Berkeley where different groups showed this film.

  It is a great film.  It is inspired by a great struggle, the fight by the Algerian people to gain independence. In real life and in this film, the French government and all its institutions, even the French socalled Communist Party, believed Algeria was ""part of France"" and despite the overwhelmiong support of its non-European majority for independence, for years they made war on the Algerian people.

  The battle of Algiers is really the first active phase of the independence fight in which the FLN, National Liberation Front, waged a terrorist campaign launching bombings in the areas where the French security forces and French settler colonialists lived, worked, and played.

  The film is very accurate about the barbaric and terrorist response the French security forces used against the Algerian freedom fighters. Massive torture--I will always remember the graphic scene where dentists pull teeth to get confessions-- and murders, bombings of entire neighborhoods and public humiliation of Arabs by the French are shown in this movie.  The true heroism of the leaders of the FLN as they were hunted down and murdered by the French as well as the support they obtained from the Arab masses in the country is also shown.

This history is acted out in a starkly realistic dramatic movie. The French security forces are not described as monsters, but as real men carrying out the logic of the system of colonialism and imperialism.  The strength of the ordinary people, professors and store owners, children and old women, of the Algerian resistance is portrayed by actors who portay them as ordinary people fighting for the freedom of their country.

""The Battle of Algiers"" only depicts the initial terrorist phase of the freedom struggle. It doesn't show the years of careful organizing that won millions of Algerians to the revolution or the desperate struggle to build an army that battled the French that was key to the Algerian victory.  Nor does it show the great support for the Algerian revolution that developed not only in the rest of the Arab world, but in France itself.

This is a good film, not just history.  It left its mark on the radicals of the 1960s so strong that ""The Battle of  Algiers"" was required viewing for members of the original Black Panther Party. Their leader Huey P. Newton wrote his pamphlet on their strategy, ""The Correct Handling of a Revolution,"" with this film in his mind.  He wrote of assassinating police officers as they lounged in cafes drinking coffee and sipping wine, something you might see in this movie, but not in the streets of Oakland, California",1119398400,7,3016,4.968127490039841

507207,5,6302737249,"Review of the Criterion version of the Battle of Algiers: Excellent technical quality of the 3 DVDs included in the pack. The transfer of the film to DVD is impeccable, both from an imagery as well as sound standpoints. The English subtitles are as good as they get  (obviously it is better to understand  French and Arabic, the two languages used in the film. Trivia: the English language  makes a brief appearance in the film)

Commentary: This is a movie for realists, this is not a sugar coated, sanitised story. It is an example of Italian neo-realism at its best, based on a book written by Algerian Yacef Saadi, used to write the screen play. Note to the wise: some of the military equipment depicted is not 100% accurate (too modern for the film's time period).  My advise is to get passed it, this ain't Tom Clancy (no disrespect intended, I am a proud former member of the military and a Clancy fan) . What's important is the language of the picture.

It is not a question if you agree or not with the movie's bias (it is obviously more pro-Algerian then French but more even-handed than the French care to admit) but rather the conclusions you can reach after seeing the movie. The movie can be seen either as an Urban Warfare, a Terror/Counter-terror primer and/or historical film

Therefore, if you do not like to think and analyse, then don't bother buying the movie. No adrenaline rush whatsoever fuelled by a Hollywood special effects studio.

Rumour has it that the Pentagon screened this movie in 2002. If they did, good for them. There are many lessons to be learned about fighting a counter-insurgency.

It is also the story of the more powerful outside fighting an insurgency, winning the battle but losing the war (the TET offensive of the Vietnam War comes to mind).

More chilling are:

-Methods such as throwing people out of aircraft over the sea (later seen in Argentina) were used by the French (mentioned in one of the accompanying documentaries).

-Point-blank murder methods on Law enforcement, Judiciary and other forms of authority used by the FLN, were later taught by the latter to European terrorist groups (the  Basque Terror Group ETA).

-Holding out the first 24 hours of interrogation by the French in order to protect their people was also a tactic taught by the FLN-run government to the Basque Terror Group ETA.

-Frustration at the lack of penetrability of the FLN in its incipient urban stage and holding out for the first 24 hours led to the systematic torture and disappearance of prisoners.

-The pitfalls of employing torture on the long run.

-The use of battle hardened Army Airborne troops to do police work in what is not a situation of open warfare leads to the us vs. them mentality that stokes the recruitment of the insurgency. This was further compounded by the fact that the French had suffered defeat by the Viet Cong and were under political pressure to perform.  And furthermore the chain of command not only knew what was going on but sanctioned these practices.

-The blowing up of houses as a method of retaliation on the part of both the Authorities as well as ""death squads""  is seen here.

-How ""kicking butt"" and then handing out food does not work. People's dignity and urge to resist will overcome the need for comfort food.

-How an insurgent group asserts political control through a ""law & order"" and no-vices platform. How violent acts are only allowed with Front permission. The Front as a guarantor of security. General strikes as a tool of war and a propagandistic wake up call to the dominant force's civilian government.

507208,5,6302737249,"The Battle of Algiers: it's a wonderful piece of cinema and a surprisingly unbiased look into modern-day colonialism and its effects.

What immediately struck me was how the film never seems to root for one side or the other, but is somewhat ambivalent - showing personal opinions behind the two struggling sides in this conflict. The film is sensitive to both and takes time to get the viewer to feel both sides' arguments.

It's remarkable that few in 1966 watched this film and compared it to the Vietnam struggle going on at the same time in Asia. Americans have never been able to grasp Vietnam from the viewpoint of the Vietnamese, and if more Americans had watched the Battle of Algiers, they might have finally ""got it"". People will go to incredible lengths to preserve or establish their independance. It's a lesson that, remarkably, neither the French in this film, or America today seem to understand, even though, paradoxically, both nations were founded on violent revolutions for independance and freedom. The most forward-thinking and liberal nations on earth in 1789 have become two of the most reactionary and Conservative today.

What is also striking about this fascinating film is how relevant it is today. With the continuing struggles between the third-world countries of the Islamic world and the prosperous globally-active western nations, it isn't hard to replace Algerians with Iraqis and French soldiers with American ones to draw instant parallels.

Why aren't we learning the lessons we all need to learn? Perhaps if more of us studied the Battle of Algiers, we might start. When Algeria became independant, the world did not crumble, the French nation did not fall, Western Capitalism did not go into collapse. What did happen is told beautifully in this remarkably fresh film.",1114819200,7,1807,5.074074074074074

507210,5,6302737249,"A stunning package. First the film itself, so powerful, and so relevant to today's wars and our ongoing prison scandals. The real powerhouse is the material on Disk 3. Watch and listen to the main French and FLN players in the events in the film scramble to justify their actions. The FLN leader justifies his bombmaking, the female FLN operative who placed bombs does the same, the French commander justifies his use of torture in interrogation. I thought that this was as a good a presentation as I could ever anticipate. Then came ""Etats d'armes"", a 2002 documentary showing French military officers speaking frankly on torture, admitting they ordered it, admitting they carried it out, and explaining why. One senior officer sadly notes that he operated outside the bounds of ""any Western military officer and Christian,"" but that he carried out his assigned mission as ordered, losing part of his soul in the process, if not his honor. Others who saw evidence of torture resigned, and they explain why.

A third documentary on the director's return visit to Algiers in 1992 shows a level of hostility and hopelessness that is shocking and painful to watch. The tour through the bowels of the Casbah is spooky.

As another reviewer notes, it is no wonder that the French wanted no part of Iraq. Who could fairly blame them after all they have experienced in their own colonial nightmares?

We seem doomed to repeating every mistake the French have ever made. We love to hate them, but I cannot but help admire in a strange way the French officers who were doomed to fight The Battle of Algiers. At least these officers take responsibility for their actions in their war on terror, something we have not yet mastered.",1111968000,12,1720,4.823728813559322

The film ""The Battle of Algiers"" vividly captures the political and human drama of Algeria's struggle to end 130 years of French colonialism. Although it was shot in 1965, it has been re-released with new subtitles and is currently playing to sold-out theaters in selected U.S. cities. It should be available on DVD soon.

Gillo Pontecorvo, the director, fought the Nazis as a member of the Italian resistance and was a member of the Italian Communist Party for a while. Saadi Yacef, the leader of the National Liberation Front (FLN) during the battle of Algiers, wrote the book on which the film is based, produced it and plays himself (El-hadi Jafaar).

What shines through in so many of the scenes is the interest and participation of the people of Algiers, who had lived through the battle. ""In 1965,"" when this film was shot, Yacef said, ""the wound was still bleeding."" And the wound went deep: According to Algerian historians, over a million Algerians died in the struggle.

In the last scene, which takes place two years after the French have crushed the NLF's organization in Algiers, the people show where their hearts are and where their allegiance lies. They come out into the streets in mass, aggressively confronting the French tanks, waving thousands of Algerian flags--made overnight with no tipoff to the French and their informers.

The enthusiasm and verve of the performances make it clear that the actors were reprising roles that they had previously played in real life.

The grand demonstrations made it clear that while the French might have won the campaign, they had lost the political struggle. The Algerians were letting the world know that.

The Algerians' political methods and motives are presented so clearly in the film. How they responded to the French military, organized themselves, their bravery, self-sacrifice and determination are shown so graphically that revolutionaries from the Black Panthers to the Irish Republican Army, the Palestinians to South America have reportedly studied the film.

Not only revolutionaries have studied it. Last summer, the Pentagon's Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict office sent out an e-mail for a private screening: ""How to win a battle against terrorism and lose the war of ideas. Children shoot soldiers at point blank range. Women plant bombs in cafs. Soon the entire Arab population builds to a mad fervor. Sound familiar? The French have a plan. It succeeds tactically, but fails strategically. To understand why, come to a rare showing of this film.""

The Pentagon planners obviously were looking for insights, useful for the campaign the United States is currently waging in Iraq.

The United States is not alone in this. According to the Irish Times (Jan. 17), the British Army in the Six Counties of northern Ireland also studied the film for tips on confronting the Irish Republican Army as that struggle developed.

Since the film concentrates on Algiers--very important but just a small part of a bit country--it leaves the impression that it was the change in public opinion in France and throughout the world that led to the signing of the Evian Accords on March 18, 1962.

The ""Atlas de la Guerre d'Algrie"" (Paris, 2003) points out that the FLN, using donations of heavy military equipment from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, had been able to build a powerful, modern army in Tunisia and Morocco, Algeria's neighbors. The military threat to the French Army was growing, especially since it was tied down by low-intensity guerrilla warfare throughout a vast country.

Role of the French Communist Party

In the film, the French paratrooper commander--Col. Carol Mathieu, played by Jean Martin, the only professional actor in the cast--asserts at a news conference that L'Humanit, the newspaper of the French Communist Party (PCF), supports the presence of his paratroopers in Algiers.

Mathieu does not really misrepresent the PCF's position. On a national, official level the PCF opposed the French Army's oppression and violations of human rights in Algeria. But it did not support Algerian independence.

PCF militants and members often had close political relations with the FLN, and took great risks, and some casualties, in supporting them. Maurice Audin, a member of the PCF and a mathematics teacher in Algeria, was tortured to death by the army, which was trying to extract information about his connection to the FLN. Another member of the PCF was guillotined.

Scores of PCF members went to jail because they resisted the draft. Others set up safe houses, raised money and agitated in support of the FLN and a free and independent Algeria.

On Oct. 17, 1961, the FLN led a demonstration. Although French troops were starting to withdraw from Algeria, French colonialism was still trying to hang onto the oil-rich section of Algeria in the Sahara desert.

The demonstration was called to protest a curfew imposed on Algerians living in Paris. Small contingents of young members of the PCF marched with their Algerian comrades, but the march was overwhelmingly Algerian, with whole families coming out.

Maurice Papon, the prefect of the Paris region--equivalent to a governor in the United States--was in charge. He was later convicted of crimes against humanity for his role in shipping Jews to Auschwitz during the German occupation. On Oct. 17, the cops attacked the demonstration, beat hundreds of demonstrators, shot some, and threw them, dead or alive, into the Seine River. Demonstrators either drowned or died from the beatings.

Out of 35,000 demonstrators, 15,000 were arrested. Police beat some of them to death in the detention centers.

The cops, in their subsequent cover-up, ignored reports of bodies pulled from the Seine for months. For more details see the French web site: [...] .free.fr/.

Three months later, on Feb. 8, 1962, the French Communist Party called for a mass demonstration under the slogan ""Peace in Algeria and no to the OAS."" The OAS--Secret Army Organization--in the words of the PCF ""was hostile to any peace and any kind of independence for the Algerian people, and had launched a terrorist campaign in Paris beginning in early 1961.""

At the Charonne subway stop, the cops, still under orders from Papon, attacked and beat eight demonstrators to death in a battle that left blood dripping from the station's ceiling.

Outrage was so great that hundreds of thousands took to the streets in a general strike a few days later. That sealed the defeat of French imperialism and made holding onto Algerian oil impossible.

But Charonne also displaced the memory of Oct. 17. Only a long, stubborn struggle on the part of some French and Algerian progressives in the 1990s brought those memories back alive.

Impact of the Algerian Revolution

Even before Algeria won its independence, the FLN's National Liberation Army, the ALN, was training cadres from the South African and Angolan liberation struggles at bases in Morocco and Tunisia. Nelson Mandela was one of the top African National Congress leaders trained in Algeria. A few years later the ALN was training cadres from Mozambique's FRELIMO, in both Algeria and Tanzania.

The ANC's obituary for Johnstone Makatini, who was popularly called Johnny and represented the ANC at the United Nations for many years, captures the flavor of the times and the ferment that was brewing in the FLN camps in Morocco and later in Algiers. 1962, Johnny was among the first group of volunteers from Natal to be sent out of the country for military training. ...

""In Morocco he worked and struck a close friendship with leaders of liberation movements from the then Portuguese colonies, among them Marcelino Dos Santos of Mozambique, Dr. Agostinho Neto of Angola and Amilcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau. In 1963, Algeria became independent. ... Algeria, which hosted many liberation movements, mainly from Africa and including the Palestine Liberation Organization, was a beehive of political activity involving solidarity support for the liberation struggle.""

The prestige of Algeria was so high and its support among the more progressive countries in sub-Saharan Africa was so strong that when the Organization of African Unity was formed in 1963 it was naturally a Pan-African organization, which considered the Sahara as a bridge rather than a barrier.

The strength and passion revealed in this film explains why the Algerian Revolution, which is still unfinished, had such an impact on the continent of Africa, and indeed, the world.

It is worth seeing the new version of the ""Battle of Algiers"" even if you have seen it before because it is a very powerful film.",1109203200,4,8770,5.127629733520337
507246,5,6302737249,"This is the first time that I have seen this film, strange, since I earned a doctorate in French in 1977 and teach the language, culture and history at a university.  Francophone studies are de rigueur today, since colonialism has crumbled, at least in most of the world, and the presence of North African immigrants in France today, with the culture clash between the secular government and religious Muslims, is a hot topic.  No doubt the rareness of showings is the main reason, but now that the film is available, I count myself fortunate to have it in my collection.  For a faux documentary, ""The Battle of Algiers"" leaves an impression of having witnessed historical events at close range.  The hand-held camera weaves us through the winding alleyways of the casbah, the white-clad crowds and French soldiers, checkpoints and explosions.  We swallow repulsion at the sight of the clinical, barbaric torture scenes, the heads held underwater, the electric shocks, the bleeding flesh.  All the action proceeds relentlessy, economically, so as to convey as much information as possible.  Most effective is the use of non-professionals, so we link eyes with Berbers, Numidians, Khabyles and other indigenous inhabitants of the Maghreb.  French and Arabic alternate as colonizers and colonized are locked in the inevitable struggle.  The natives are restless, they are mad as hell and they are not going to take it anymore.  The characters are emblematic--irrepressible urchins who blithely risk their life to deliver secret messages and weapons and who even kill the oppressors, native women clad in white veils who transport guns in their baskets, young ladies who cut and dye their long hair and shed traditional garb to be able to sashay through checkpoints to the flirtatious comments and invitations of the gallant French soldiers.  One of these sips Coca-Cola in a cafe, ogled by an eager Lothario, leaving after having slipped a purse containing a time-bomb beneath the counter.  Two other women repeat her action, one in an Air France office, the other in a discotheque pulsating with young European dancers, undulating to the Spanish strains of a song about ""Rebeca.""  As all three bombs go off, the European settlers react in outrage and disbelief, as if their pet poodles had suddenly turned into wolves and began mauling their masters.  How could these inferior beings dare to shake off the benign and paternal rule of the Europeans who have brought culture, learning, order and Catholicism into their benighted land?  Well-housed, well-dressed, well-fed, the ""pieds-noirs"" consider themselves the true masters of THEIR Algeria.  And indeed, the rebels are not very admirable beings, as the focus of our interest is Ali-la-Pointe, an erstwhile pimp and lowlife who personifies the revolution in his derring-do and idealism.  Played impressively by the amateur and unlettered Algerian Brahim Haggiag, Ali resists to the end.  He and his three companions are the sacrifice offered up to the maintenance of civilization and order.  However, as history has recorded and as the stoic, determined faces of the Greek-chorus-like natives show us, the tragedy is not finalized.  Despite the ruthless and pragmatic methods of General ""Mathieu"" (the real-life Massiu), the resistence will continue, rooted inexorably in the mass of white-clad natives crowding the casbah.  At times shouting ""Freedom,"" ""Long live Algeria,"" at other times mourning and ululating, the crowd will not disappear or turn into a docile heap.  Alia iacta est. The die has been cast.  Pontecorvo has been accused of glorifying the slayers of innocents and of showing methods of guerrilla warfare that have inspired future terrorists.  Indeed, the bombed cafes of Great Britain, Israel and Indonesia seem to be mirror reflections of scenes in his film.  But in portraying the events in a documentary fashion, Pontecorvo has striven to show both sides of the conflict.  In the end, colonialism destroys itself.  The parallels of history are obvious.  We can compare the reactions of the European settlers of Algeria to those of the Anglo-Irish when the rebels began to burn their palatial residences, to those of the white Europeans confronted by the Mau-Mau uprising, to the terror of the settlers of the American West when attacked by unfriendly natives.  Somewhere along the line, the abuses exact revenge.  And the abuses continue, the terrorism continues.  We can see scenes from ""The Battle of Algiers"" in the checkpoints in Palestine and Iraq, in the Palestinian women and children transporting weapons and bombs, in soldiers of occupying forces invading homes, breaking down doors, arresting anyone who is not one of them.  Timely and powerful, this film is a must for those who seek insight into today's volatile situations in the Middle East.  It is true that the whole picture is not seen, only what Pontecorvo has selected for us to view.  In spite of his objectiveness, many have criticized him for siding too obviously with the rebels.  Others have bemoaned what Algeria has become today after the evacuation of the French presence, a bloodbath where human rights are non-existent.  And yet we must remember that ""the whole truth"" is not the point of the film.  Pontecorvo has recorded certain moments, as a photographer selects certain pictures to illustrate what he has observed, to tell as a story, only in part, and yet to leave some impression.  It is up to us to read the history to fill in what has been omitted.  And if this film inspires such a search for knowledge, then Pontecorvo has succeeded in his mission.  In my view, this is one of the finest films of the sixties and certainly on the subject of Algeria.  I would also recommend the French film ""Outremer,"" very different in that it is a dramatic fiction, yet very outstanding in its own manner.",1107648000,8,5853,5.099685204616999
507247,5,6302737249,"I remember seeing the Battle of Algiers many years ago and being impressed then.  It is a gripping historical drama which leaps of the screen at the viewer.  If anything, the film has gotten better with age.  The Criterion Collection edition is beautifully put together and the quality of the entire project is superb.  There were several times, both then and now, that I was certain I was watching a documentary, especially some of the panoramic shots of the Casbah occupied by French paratroopers.

The story of the Algerian uprising is powerful in and of itself.  Watching it recently, I felt some jarring similarities with events in the world today.  An occupying western power with superior military strngth, faced down by a hidden insurgency, with popular roots in Islam.  Sound familiar?  The scenes of terrorism were eerily reminiscent also, made all the more powerful by the alluring disguises of the women planting their bombs.  Today, we have inherited the consequences of the Casbah.  No wonder the French didn't want to go to Iraq.",1106956800,5,1044,4.976878612716763

507250,5,6302737249,"I don't know from any other source whether the film is fully accurate and as is debated below. Pontecorvo did not ""know"" whether the French initiated the bombing as he shows. But based on their known departure from civilized norms in the form of torture, why should they stop from retaliating for the murder of police by escalating to bombing the Casbah?

In other words, re-opening the debate puts into question whether a state, whether France then or the US today, can cop a plea of innocent to any one specific crime when at the same time claiming the privilege to commit what are crimes.

""Gee, we would NEVER bomb the Casbah to start the fun, but at the same time we should be permitted to use torture. We are after all hommes civilisatrice who just don't do that sort of thing. Nonetheless, we should be allowed to retaliate...we should have a blank check.""

The Battle of Algiers is stunningly relevant today, when the nominee for US attorney general is bleating before congressmen (some of whom, like Joe Biden, had trouble maintaining a straight face) that he never thought the US can use torture.

The French of the 1950s thought they had settled their committment to civilized norms in the Dreyfus affair of the early century and in the struggle against Fascism. However, the Algerians confronted them with the limits of their committment.

Guy Mollet militarized the problem which (as Col Mathieu, the French para commander in the film insists) made it necessary in Algeria to open a gap between the abstract committment to human rights and praxis.

The US tried the same stunt at Guantanamo. The military response (in context extra legal) placed metropolitan France (exclusive of course of Algeria despite the claims) in chaos in the early 1960s because the returning French migrants and the OAS were unhappy with the French exit.

Once extralegal means are used they become common currency.

By mere omission if not outright changes to the facts, the movie without being fiction is indeed a ""documentary"" which is misread as reportage of the unknown facts. The surviving Algerian ""terrorists"" admit they took French lives but they DON'T admit they bombed their own people to escalate the war, and their ""general strike"" certainly indicates that they kept trying to return to the parliamentary road.

Their honesty in fact may be compared to any French apologist who claims that the Algerians bombed their own folk and that when the French used torture they could do so and stay somehow within a mission civilisatrice.

The rule is ""your deeds make you a terrorist because they are indicative of your norms, but I can do the same without being a terrorist"". Even Racine could not make sense, or a decent Alexandrine, out of this.

In a situation like that in the US today, that of epistemological crisis where we don't agree on core narratives, a documentary can hope to present a coherent story while doing as much justice as it can to the facts.

It may or may not be true that there were Saudi flights before September 13 2001 when flights were reopened as Mike Moore implies but does not state in his documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and in a context where people's lives may be in danger if they so much as access computer files to find the facts, the fact may be unverifiable.

But being lured into debate as to whether there were or were not obscures the fact that Prince Bandar and a theocracy far more radical than Iran is a great friend of Bush, and that one law exists for the wealthy and powerful, and another for the rest of us...that, in fact, Americans below elite rank have been INTERNALLY colonized much as were the denizens of the Casbah.

The Battle of Algiers presents a coherent and morally serious story. Prior to the events depicted, the Algerians, who'd served the French in both wars as laborers (like the Chinese and Annamese) and as cannon fodder, went cap in hand and applied for simple dignity and self-determination, lining up in fact behind Ho Chi Minh.

The French blew them off because it did not want to again resettle the population of Alsace/Lorraine...even though Germany had coughed up Alsace/Lorraine at Versailles!

The FLN took the next step...which the French had taken in 1789. Unfortunately for them, the word ""terrorist"" was indiscriminantly applied, a word unavailable to Louis XVI who like the Romanovs had no narrative for what hit him.

One thing the movie makes clear is the deeply Islamist nature of the FLN, who were completely misdescribed as Communist (the catchall word of 1956). The FLN, and the people of Algiers, were offended by smoking, drugs and alcohol and their attempt to enforce community norms (certainly the right of a community within some bound) was, it seems, an early feature of their revolution.

Ali LaPointe was no thug, any more than Malcolm X, unless one is completely so captivated by Hollywood stereotypes as to miss his capacity for change.

Contemporary Algeria is filtered through as chaos by the Western media perhaps because astonishingly long-lived campaigns are conducted against societies with the bad taste to rebel against the French. Perhaps the execution of Louis XIV and the Terror create a sort of guilty recognition resulting in the centuries-long degradation of Haiti.

And in the film one gets the sense that while the Algerians had no love at all for the French (apart from the fact that the women who bomb the cafes are portrayed as well aware of what they are about to do: kill innocents), the French had the French police inspectors twisted love for their Jean Valjeans in Algeria.

Indeed, when Mathieu personally directs the last attack, the closeness of the Casbah makes the whole thing into a family affair, an intimate gathering of neighbors.

The problem, however, is presented visually. The Euros get the nice vistas, spacious avenues and big apartments: the people who pick up their crap get the Casbah and are stacked several to a room. The Algerians reject Mathieu's weary paternalism and look back to say are we not men.

The film makes clear that you can talk all you want about markets and development but underlying these necessary features is the old Hegelian struggle for simple recognition. The US would do well to reason that whatever its opinion of people who use suicide bombing, they aren't going away because they are already the homeboys.

The DVD also has an excellent mini-documentary narrated by the late Edward Said of Pontecorvo's work and another about the Algerian mess. It took two colonial dog's dinners for France to wise up; perhaps after Vietnam and Iraq there's hope for my country.

But moral seriousness is at a discount in the USA, that moral seriousness which stops taking other people's moral inventory, and insists they gotta stop being terrorists before we will look to our own actions.",1105056000,6,6836,4.862306368330465

  More broadly, it was an indictment of the whole rotting system of colonialism. The Allies had freed themselves from Nazism & fascism.

507294,5,6302737249,"I admit that being a cinephile, I was ignorant of such a title being in existance for so long. Then one fine day, I chanced upon the trailer for a theatrical re-release. Initially, I was underwhelmed and apprehensive, since it looks like a bunch of old archive newsreels crammed and slapped together to look and sound coherent as a feature length documentary. Was I wrong, after I caught a little blurb in the trailer that states that not one frame of it is actual documentary footage.

I did as little research on my own, and to my surprise, it was financed and produced by a former ""terrorist"" cell leader. The conventional ""Amerikan"" wisdom is that terrorists, especially Arabs one, tend to be brainwashed, naive, horny, gullible suicidal fools with wet dreams of fornicating virgins in paradise. But this docudrama (I am rather hesitant to call this a film, since it resembles an actual newsreel footage) shows an unbiased point of view from both sides of a polarized world torn apart by differences in culture, mentality and mother tongues.

Algiers is being portrayed as a war torn town. Grimy and seedy, something out of a dystophian future. The Algerian masses were being treated like Orwellian proles by the French colonial masters, who themselves acted with the very air of superiority and arrogance that spelt their eventual downfall there and as well as Indochina. The French should have learnt their lesson in the 1954 siege at Dhien Bhien Phu. Thinking that they excelled better at countering urban guerilla war, they launched a huge offensive that cost lives on both sides with the delusion that they won after the death of Ali La Pointe.

This docudrama unfortunately did not chronicle the eventual independence of Algiers, of which would also probably hold as much interest as the terrorist activities that portend this cry for independence.

This Criterion Collection DVD edition did the docudrama justice. A 3-disc box set, along with an 80 page booklet that is both informative and enlightening.

The Criterion Collection has assembled an impressive collection of extras and a stunning new transfer for one of the most important and influential political films ever made.

Criterion has spread the substantial extras over three DVDs. The first disc features a nice collection of behind-the-scenes stills and posters from all over the world, including a good one from the U.S. with the enticing tagline, ""J. Edgar Hoover has seen it have you? Blueprint for revolution."" Also included are two trailers, the original theatrical one and a 2004 re-release.

The second DVD starts off with a profile of the film's director, ""Gillo Pontecorvo: The Dictatorship of Truth,"" a 1992 documentary on the life, politics and his approach to filmmaking. It also examines why, after the early success of The Battle of Algiers, he failed to make a movie for 20 years.

""Marxist Poetry: The Making of The Battle of Algiers"" is a new 52-minute documentary made specifically for the DVD. It is an in-depth look, from its genesis through filming to its enduring legacy.

""Five Directors"" features interview soundbites with Spike Lee, Mira Nair, Julian Schnabel, Steven Soderbergh and Oliver Stone as they talk about the importance of Algiers and how it influenced them. It is quite interesting to listen to these filmmakers talk about the movie and offer their observations.

The third disc begins with ""Remembering History,"" a new documentary that provides insight into the Algerian side of their struggle for independence. Historians are interviewed and trace the origins of the struggle, provide context and point out that the film only shows a small part of it.

""Etats d'armes"" explores the French side of the conflict. Several participants are interviewed and talk about how Algerians were tortured to get information that avoided future terrorist acts. In their opinion the urgency of the situation justified the use of torture.

""A Case Study"" features a conversation between Christopher Isham of ABC News, Richard A. Clarke, former National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism, and Michael A. Sheehan, former State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism. They discuss the use of terrorism in the film to provoke a response from the French and from the Algerian people.

Finally, ""Return to Algiers"" sees Pontecorvo and his son return to Algeria 27 years after his film was released to document how it has changed politically and socially.

Criterion has come through again with another stunning release with this fantastic 3-DVD set of The Battle of Algiers.

507296,5,6302737249,"Battle of Algiers is one of my favorite films.  However, it is propaganda -- and the viewer should be aware of that.

The bombing in the Casbah, for example, that is shown as the work of the French police, actually remained a mystery.  An accidental explosion in a bomb factory?  Some internicene feud?  No one knew.  Yet the film unhesitatingly makes it the work of the French.  This is critical, as the FLN attacks on civilians then become subsequent.  They are implicitly justified as reprisals for beastliness initiated by the French.

More egregiously, the film simply lies when it shows the FLN launching its operations in Algiers with selective attacks on French soldiers and policemen.  Actually, they indiscriminantly attacked French males -- uniformed and civilian.  See above:  the moral fable becomes the 'good' FLN beginning with attacks only on combatants and only sinking to indiscriminant terrorism when it is initiated by the French.  The truth would seem to be somewhat less flattering to the FLN.  Rightly or wrongly, they waged their war through terrorism all along.

As with all good propaganda, 'Battle of Algiers' tells the truth -- most of the time.  The specific bombing incidents shown really happened, etc.  The viewer should be aware of the exceptions, which are significant and contribute critically to the message of the film.

My source, by the way, for the assertions I have made is Alister Horne's excellent history of the Algerian war.  I am not attempting to condemn the FLN -- I heartily support the Palestinian 'terrorists,' who can be even less discriminating.  However, the film does oversimplify the conflict and try to make one side out to be morally more irreproachable than it in fact was.

Yeah, yeah, your people fought for ""freedom"", ""self determination"" against ""racism"" colonialism blah, blah, blah (Note there is not a lot of ""diversity"" in modern day Algeria were everyone who wasn't Arab Muslim has been murdered, ethnically cleansed, driven into the sea. )

The best party of the great movie the Battle of Algiers is that the director, while being obviously sympathetic to the Arab Muslim side, doesn't fall into this blind, lying PC propaganda. He shows the struggle from both sides. And the director shows the truth that the leaders of the FLN were terrorists, featuring low life, criminals like the pimp, petty thief Ali-la-Pointe. While the director does not present the FLN atrocities against French Pied Noir children in Philippeville in 1955 or show the FLN's policy of targeting moderate Arabs with murder, the Battle of Algiers does show the reality of modern wars where terrorism against civilians is the main  battle strategy of those trying to overthrow the existing order.

I recommend people view and study the movie the Battle of Algiers and understand what makes angry, alienated, hateful losers like Ali-Le Pointe or the DC Sniper seek revenge and immortality by living a life of murder and terrorism.

Note that radical Muslim groups are recruiting heavily in America's prisons - also in European and British prisons. The West will see many, many more Ali-Le Pointes and we will see if the West has any Gen  Massus or Paul Aussaresses to fight terror with terror.

507299,5,6302737249,"Battle of Algiers displays the occupied Algeria attempt to fight for freedom as they have been under French rule since the 1830's.  A little background history would enlighten the audience as the invasion of North Africa, Land of the Berbers, by the French in the 1830's was instigated by 300 years of ""pirating"" ships in the Mediterranean and raids of southern Europe, which enslaved many Europeans that were brought to Africa.  However, the French occupation brought great injustices to the Algerian people as they are treated as second class citizens.  In addition, the French controlled the markets, resources, and jobs, which only further the lives of the French citizens.

The injustices forced upon the Algerians to live in poverty, unemployment, societal harassment, and unequal rights.  Consequently, the Algerians begin to rise against the injustice, but the unequal military force drives the Algerian freedom fighters to exercise terrorism and other hideous acts of violence.  This violence is fed by further aggression from the French police as it escalates the violence from both sides.

The story begins with a man being humanely treated after a rough bout of torture as persecuting soldiers blame the man for the excessive torture, as all he had to do was to tell them what they wanted to know.  The tortured man has just revealed the whereabouts of a known terrorist and he is in emotional agony as he is aware of what he has just done.  They dress the agonized man in a French camouflage uniform, and depart to capture the freedom fighter.

The freedom fighter, Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag), hides in a secret room behind a wall with three others.  When the French soldiers arrive they immediately seek the hidden room and they threaten to detonate a bomb that will destroy the building with them inside unless surrender.  In this moment Ali flashbacks to how he ended up in this situation, which also conveys the importance of this moment in Algerian history.

Gillo Pontecorvo and Franco Solinas wrote a politically loaded story about the Algerian liberation in the 1960s that depicted the French resistance to let go of their colony in northern Africa.  The film was released in a time when the world was divided in east, Warsaw Pact, and west, North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  Communism was the foundation of the east while the west was built around capitalism.  These two economical ideologies were in fact in constant confrontation in the Third World as the Western World resisted to let go of their colonies.  The civil outcry for freedom in Algeria spread a wildfire of freedom seeking people throughout the Third World.

Pontecorvo and Solinas, which laid out the framework for the film, base the story on long and hard research in Algeria.  The film is told with a strong democratic view, which is reinforced through Pontecorvo's direction, which used an Italian neorealistic approach.  The cinematic experience that is brought to the audience is powerful, as it will shake the ground upon which the audience is resting their feet.  Battle of Algiers also teaches the audience to appreciate freedom fighters such as the patient Gandhi with his nonviolent approach to reach freedom.

I am Algerian. Sentences such as ""horrible state of Algeria now that it is ruled by the Arabs"" would infuriate me! But infuriated I shall not be, as I beleive Mr John's biased text could only make me feel sorry for his misfortunes.

The movie was filmed few years after the independance of Algeria in 1962. After more than a million and half a million of algerians had been killed by french colonial forces. Algeria was  colonized since 1830. As the film relates to the period after 1954, viewer might not know of other facts: during WW2, algerians participated within the North African group of the French army, after France promised some kind of independance or autonomy shall algerians fight for them. My grand father did! After 1945, none of this happened and a quick web search on May 8th, 1945 events would shed some light on those sad events. Pontecorvo, whome I had the chance to meet during a reception held at the Algerian Embassy, managed to show how cruel war is. Be it in Algeria or elsewhere. Specially in Mr. John's Paris in 1961, where Mr. John forgot to mention the red color of the Seine. Blood red. Algerians blood red.

Terrorists! so were called those algerians fighting for their land, for their freedom. Even Italian partiggiani were called so once :-). How shall we call the colonial french then?

The Battle of Algiers builds upon the conflict that Camus outlined in his writing.  Starting with the post-war Algerian society, we see that the French have learned no lessons from their own occupation by the Germans.  Instead they continue to push the native Algerians to the edges of society and economics, forcing people to live in shantys while they gorge themselves on the fruits of the Arab and Berber laborers.  It is this marginalization that drives the Algerians to desparate terrorist action, paving the way for an independent Algerian state, and setting the example for all insurgencies and terrorist groups that have come since.

Often overlooked in analyzing the film is the fact that ultimately the film depicts a French victory, in what could be described as the first Battle of Algiers.  The total war, and vicious brutality, the French waged and used against the Algerians in the early stages prevented Algerian independence for several years.  Yet, when confronted with a native population in massive rebellion, the French colony collapsed.

The Pentagon commandos' flier advertised, ""How to win a battle against terrorism and lose the war of ideas ... Children shoot soldiers at point blank range. Women plant bombs in cafes. Soon the entire Arab population builds to a mad fervor. Sound familiar? The French have a plan. It succeeds tactically, but fails strategically."" The paratroopers' plan was to track down Yacef's top killers using intensive interrogation (i.e., torture).

Perhaps, though, our soldiers should have shown their civilian overlords ""The Battle of Algiers"" before the latter blithely decided to occupy an Arab country. For extra verisimilitude, the special-ops boys could have strapped Douglas Feith's Office of Special Plans ideologue-warriors to their armchairs, pinned their eyelids open, attached electrodes, and applied little jolts of juice to help them remember the movie better.

Even without such stimulation, ""The Battle of Algiers"" is hard to forget but also hard to enjoy. It's excellent filmmaking and frank history, yet distasteful entertainment because there are no heroes.

The central figure is the illiterate hoodlum Ali la Pointe, portrayed by the illiterate farmer Brahim Haggiag, a North African James Dean in his only movie. Why this superannuated juvenile delinquent became Yacef's best murderer is of obvious relevance today. Apparently, Ali la Pointe, like many Arabs, was outraged by the French guillotining of a terrorist who had murdered eight civilians, including a seven-year-old girl. Considering how many thousands of innocents both sides slaughtered, it's puzzling why the Muslims objected even more to a handful of the guilty being executed, but such are the snares Westerners blunder into when they rule an alien culture.

More generally, the sullen ex-pimp, like so many high-testosterone young men in Iraq, Palestine, and everywhere, just couldn't stand wealthy and powerful outsiders giving orders instead of him.

""The Battle of Algiers"" ignores France's expensive efforts to buy the hearts and minds of the Arabs and Berbers. Nor does it stress how the insurgents, to prevent peaceful compromise, mutilated and decapitated moderate Muslims and assassinated liberal Europeans. But what it does show of Yacef's 1956 terror bombings of bistros and discos is horrifying enough. Alistair Horne's exhaustive 1978 history, A Savage War of Peace, confirms many of the film's details. (Paul Johnson's tour de force summary of Horne's book-furiously illustrating how a few extremists can launch a vicious cycle of provocation, reprisal, and outrage-climaxes his famous Modern Times.)

In despair, Algiers' civil authorities hand policing over to the paratroopers under Colonel Mathieu. This glamorous character was modeled partly on the redoubtable Jacques Massu, partly on the intellectual colonels like Marcel Bigeard, who had recently parachuted gallantly into the doomed fortress of Dien Bien Phu. While an involuntary guest of General Giap, Bigeard studied Mao's theories and then used them in his sophisticated counter-guerilla strategy in Algeria.

The anti-French filmmakers give Mathieu most of the best lines. When challenged at a press conference about torture, he answers with Descartes' logic and Cyrano's panache:

The problem is: the FLN wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain ... Despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain ... Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.

The paras liquidated the Casbah rebels' leadership in 1957. In Algeria, torture worked. What the film doesn't show is that in France, though, the public started to lose the stomach for the ""necessary consequences."" Alarmed that the politicians might throw away their fallen comrades' sacrifices, the paratroopers threatened to drop on Paris in May 1958 unless Gen. Charles de Gaulle became France's strong man.

Once in power, however, that great patriot resolved to cut and run. He had to weather two coup attempts and countless assassination plots, but, minus the Algerian tumor, long-suffering France emerged peaceful, prosperous, and democratic",1097625600,20,4778,5.558459422283356
507303,5,6302737249,"This film is not about the evil of the FLN. It is about suffering under a colonial government, for both the French colonialists and Algerians.  The Algerians were not wrong to want the French out of their country, and this occupation is the beginning of the story.

The FLN at first only targets police as representatives of the government and imperial submission, leaving the civilians alone.  Then a French police commander bombs an Arab residential neighborhood.  After that the FLN begins to bomb civilian and military targets.

Pontecorvo shows who the terrorists are murdering.  The montage of French faces in the diner keeps their humanity present in the film.  He also shows us the murdered and tortured Algerians; children covered in blood, people electrocuted and beat for information.  What does each side accomplish in their war?  Some French colonial soldiers and civilians are killed, the Algerian terrorists are wiped out.  And with this small war decided, what changes?  Nothing, the anger of the Algerians continues.  The FLN is not the cause of the Algerian rebellions and protests, the French presence is.  A movement can be dismantled, but if its cause remains it will return.

This film condemns the terrorists and the French police, but the French are to blame for the conflict because it is the Algerians whose country has been seized.

Today Algeria has problems, but political freedom and social liberty can only survive if a country goes through the long process of establishing these things itself.  No outside nation can impose its own idea of civilization through force.",1096934400,31,1599,5.092307692307692
507313,5,6302737249,"As many reviewers have said, this film is likely the best example of political filmaking ever.

A fictional film, but based on real events and shot in a documentary style, ""The Battle of Algiers"" covers events during Algierias fight for independence from France in the late 1950's.

While both sides used tactics (terrorism, torture, random arrests, etc..) that are immoral, the director's bias is obvious and it is also apparent that he wants to to feel the same way.  It is difficult to avoid falling into this trap and cheering on the Algerians even though you may find the bombings horrific. You know that in a similar situation, you might be forced do similar things.

The extras are fantastic.  With over 4 1/2 hours of featurettes and documentaries, this Criterion disc may just be the DVD release of the year.  So far, I have found the discussion involving Richard Clarke to be one of the more enlightening.  The similarities between Algeria and Iraq could not be more apparent and Clarke feels that the U.S. is headed down the same road in Iraq as the French were in Algeria. We need to focus more on getting our message out (If the Bush administration has even got a plan) and trying to avoid being drawn into fighting and more warfare which will only alienate more Iraqis.

The documentaries don't just deal with the films modern day relevance though.  Most of them are about the film's beginnings and what it is like in Algeria today

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone of any political leaning.  You will learn a lot from it.",1096588800,15,1556,4.7011070110701105
507314,4,6302737249,"Watching this film, with its portents of an ultimate French defeat, it's hard to appreciate that the French ultimately won what we now call ""The Battle of Algiers"".  Here French forces use whatever guile they can to root out sympathizers fo FLN, the revolutionaries seeking to purge Algeria of Franc-rule.  The film has been criticized for being tilted towards the arab fighters, though the real flaw is somewhat more complex.  While FLN is shown bombing discos and killing civilians, we're never supposed to think twice about what sort of end justifes these means.  Instead, Pontecorvo remakes FLN in various scenes - Islamic, anti-colonial, nationalistic - sure that each reflects a facet of a coherent whole.  To cement things, Pontecorvo's general is so open about his methods and colonial ends that he provides enough polemic ammo for both sides.  FLN then only need justify what their means are - pointedly in one scene where one of the fighters magnaminously offers to trade the crude guerrila weapons that so offend the French occupiers for the gunships the occupiers have no compunction against using.  The irony of course is that this People's revolution gave the people nothing.  Within half a few decades, Algeria found itself in a new and bloody war aimed at replacing its ostensibly pluralist state with a theocratic one.  ""Battle"" ends with a rapturous display of the pride of Algerians against the French, the director obviously ignoring that even in sucessful People's revolutions, the real losers remain the people.",1095552000,15,1533,5.124497991967871
507315,5,6302737249,"This is simply THE best movie ever made about modern war. Many critics here are blasting the Italian director for presenting a sympathetic portrait of Algerian Arab Terrorists. So what? Many Western intellectuals, particularly Leftist, Communist intellectuals (the Director was an open Italian Communists) were very sympathetic to anti colonial, Third World revolutionary movements. But, The director doesn't lie about the actions of the Arab Terrorist in the FLN , he includes realistic scenes of the FLN murdering French civilians in discos, at  horse races, he just shows that the Arab nationalists believed the ends (national liberation, Algeria for the Arab Algerians) justified the means of a nasty war.

The movie also shows the appeal of terrorism for those on the bottom - the losers, drop outs, criminals who aspire to become Robin Hood revolutionaries by doing murder and mayhem against the rich and powerful in the name of the oppressed masses. The movie shows the former, thief, pimp Ali-la-Pointe who becomes a National hero by indiscriminately targeting French policemen and French civilians for murder.

The Arab terrorists are simply ""racists"" - they use murder, terrorism to push the interests of their people, their race against their enemies - White people, French people. Violent racism in the form of terrorism works very well. If the other side doesn't use equally harsh, violent and yeah ""racist"" tactics in response.

The Best character in the film is the French military commander Massu who does use harsh, violent and racist tactics - including the selective use of torture to identify the Arab terrorists and eliminate the terrorist cells, one terrorist at a time.

The movie shows how the Arab terrorist go from being the ""hunters"" to being the ""hunted"" - it is very exciting.

Real life history of the area is mostly  tragic. The French military basically won the Battle of Algiers, but polarized French public opinion and relations between French settlers Pied Noir and Arabs in Algeria to the point where a just multi racial society was not posible. In the end the French gave up, the Arabs ethnically cleansed all the French settlers (Same thing happened in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe), the FLN enjoyed the dream of Algeria for the Arab Algerians, but the country has fallen into a poor, corrupt Third world hell and now has a vicious Muslim extremist terrorist insurgency battling the FLN government and most of the Algerian Arabs want to move to France (millions of Arab Algerians have moved to France - where the whole bloody racial/cultural conflict has started all over again).

So, in the end perhaps mass terrorism against civilians doesn't mean victory, when the victory just brings about endless cycles of oppression and violence.

But, don't let politics spoil the movie. It is the best war movie ever made. You will think you are watching a live, documentary showing the clash of civilizations: The Battle of Algiers.",1095033600,16,2952,5.120582120582121
507316,5,6302737249,"Although shown primarily from the Muslim terrorist perspective, Director Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 film is even handed and shows the frustration the French endured in dealing with the Arab terrorists - a frustration that finally brought about the actions of fighting fire with fire.

Muslim terrorists cannot be negotiated with. They do not accept any law (other than Islam). Terrorists are single-minded. Terrorists, as the name implies, are brutal and will use anything within their power to bring about the destruction of their enemy, in this case the West. They are imbedded in our institutions and, rather than taking on the status of ""citizen"" of their country of choice, they respond only to their single-minded religion, which has been shown time and again.

Muslim terrorists are even more brutal than their western Marxist counterparts of the 1960s and 70s, as they act by not only committing brutal homicide, but also use brutal suicide in the act, making a homicidal-suicidal terrorist even more difficult to stop.

In Algiers, the French used brutal tactics in return. Although losing the overall war to political pressure, the French Army won the anti-terror war of Algiers by using tactics that deal with terrorism and terrorists.

507317,5,6302737249,"I'll review the actual film instead of rambling on about the politics.  The Battle of Algiers is a ground-breaking, must-see film.  If you have seen recent films like ""Traffic"" and ""City of God (Cidade de Deus)"", then you must see this film, for it pioneered the documentary-style utilized by those other films that puts the grit and gravel under your feet while you watch it.  The film does not purport to be a documentary, but rather than the clean, sweeping, over-directed camera shots you may be used to, the camera is usually on the ground, following the characters from their point of view.  The action is brutally realistic (for its time).  And the film-maker is certainly sympathetic with the plight of the Algerians in their struggle against the French; you will be too, if you do not share the naive view that colonialism is somehow there to ""protect"" the colonized population.  Nevertheless, the filmmaker shows some of the atrocities committed in the name of Algerian independence, such as cafe bombings that killed dozens of innocent people.  He doesn't sugarcoat these scenes, and he leaves it up to the audience to decide whether this kind of action can ever be justified (I certainly don't think so).
This film is even more relevent today, as another Arab nation undergoes colonization once again by the West.  Watch this film, and you will understand a lot more about the contemporary situation in the Middle East.",1089504000,23,1431,4.908713692946058

Most of the Algerian people were not really conscious they were victims of colonialism: lot of them got into fight during 1st & 2nd World War, and ""Les Tirailleurs Alg&eacute;riens"" (Algerian Shooters Corps) were some of the most famous Corps, sharing renown with Senegalese for their bravery and dedication. But, of course, as everyone (with open eyes) have seen during the second half of 20th century in the biggest part of Africa, and some places around the world, it so much better to be slaughtered, martyred (and, for the survivors, to be driven back to the dark ages)  by people the same skin-color, than to be protected and educated by people with a fairer skin. As well, a little known fact was, that de Gaulle, who got elected in 1958 (part of the reason being he was pro-French Algeria), had to give up in 1962 (at this time, the few remaining members of FLN could only operate from Tunisia and Morocco). That was not so long after oil was discovered in Sahara: since US oil companies did consider any newly discovered oil wells should be their own to operate, de Gaulle got an ultimatum from US government: either to give up, either to see the US adding their support to the one by USSR, which was not effective enough. Which was the main reason why de Gaulle got rid of the SHAPE and US bases in France (those who were the most sorry were the French people getting work from that presence), and maybe that was one of the reasons why Giscard d'Estaing (10 years later) gave support to Ayatollah Khomeiny (although he was not very much thanked for this by the beneficiary) against the Shah of Iran, who was, until he got in hospital, the US favorite.
 I'd like very much to see a sequel to this movie, prefaced by Pontecorvo presenting his apologies for the somewhat biased making of this one (all the way more dangerous, since a very well-made one and apparently sincere: but when you know that apparent sincerity was -and still is- one of the communists' weapon of choice.....). Maybe at the time of this film release, it was fashionable to present the fight initiated by a few thugs making believe it was the legitimate fight by a nation for it's freedom, but, after half a century, when you look at what happened (and is still happening) in this country, there is only one thing anyone can be sure of : Gillio Pontecorvo's moral integrity and intellectual honesty is very much to be doubted; if not, he would have to be one of the most gullible and dumb fools to be put in the Guiness' Book of Records (which I don't think he is).",1089417600,9,2932,4.6473988439306355

507320,4,6302737249,"I finally got around to seeing this 1967 film, depicting the French occupation of colonial Algiers in the 1950s, which eventually led to the independence of this Muslim nation. It is well worth watching in order to learn lessons about the Iraq aftermath, although one should not make too many connections. The biggest difference is that the French wanted to stay and maintain the country as a colony, whereas the U.S. cannot wait to get the heck out of Iraq as soon as it is semi-secure. This film is black-and-white with sub-titles. It is very revealing in its descriptions of how terrorists (or freedom fighters) fight guerrilla war, and it is the last straw (after Diem bien Phu) for French militarism. Read Camus to get a perspective on their mindset at the time. The film ends with the French having destroyed the cell responsible for a series of bombings, but in its denoument shows that a few years later an uprising occurred, out of nowhere really, that finally left the French with the conclusion that they did not have the stomach for colonialization. This story should be studied in light of French failures in Syria, Lebanon, its Foreign Legion's wars (plus Belgium's failure in the Congo), and the determination of this study is that the French have contributed mightily to destabilization of the Middle East, a little known fact in today's discourse.

507321,5,6302737249,"""The Battle of Algiers"" is the story of a revolution. The film--based on real events--begins in 1954 with Ali-La-Pointe--an illiterate, unemployed ex-boxer. He winds up in prison, and it's there that he begins to identify with the F.N.L.--the National Liberation Front. The F.N.L.'s goal is an independent Algeria--free from French occupation--ruled ""with a  framework of Islamic principles."" Once out of prison, Ali joins the F.N.L and begins 'cleansing' the Casbah (the Muslim section of Algiers) of undesirable Algerians who dabble in prostitution, narcotics and alcohol. The film shifts focus from Ali to the uprising against French Occupation. The situation subtly escalates--French police who sit peacefully drinking coffee in street cafes are murdered, and anti-Arab feelings mount. With a momentum of its own, the situation is blown beyond all control--terrorism is rampant--cafes, air terminals, and racetracks are all targets. Naturally, the French respond, but terrorism still increases, and French officials bump up against such bureaucratic necessities as search warrants and paperwork. Soon the French are behind sandbags and barbed wire, and the Muslim population of the Casbah are subject to checkpoints manned by French soldiers. At this point, seasoned warrior French Lieutenant Colonel Mathieu arrives. While the French residents of Algiers welcome his arrival, Mathieu's march though the streets ultimately seems sinister. He's a career soldier, highly principled in his own way--and he's there to win.
Mathieu doesn't mess about. He takes control of the situation and tells his officers ""to succumb to humane considerations only leads to hopeless chaos."" Strategy dramatically changes as Mathieu methodically rounds up and tortures Algerians. It's a shotgun approach--evidently if you round up enough people and torture them, information will eventually pry loose. And it is by this method that Mathieu begins to break down the cell structure of the terrorist group. Using torture undermines the morality of the French position, but Mathieu tells the troubled French press that the matter is simple--the F.N.L wants the French out, but if France chooses to keep Algeria ""you must accept the consequences.""
""The Battle of Algiers"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It's black and white, directed by Italian director, Gillo Pontecorvo with English subtitles. The film has a somewhat grainy look to it that underscores the feeling you're watching a documentary. Interestingly enough the only professional actor in the entire film is Jean Martin who plays Lt Colonel Mathieu (based on General Massu). It's a travesty that this film has faded into obscurity, but evidently enough people know about it for a screening of the film to take place for Special Operations at the Pentagon on August 27, 2003. ""The Battle of Algiers"" was banned in France and is considered the quintessential film study of a nationalistic insurgency against capitalist suppression. If you are interested in watching an unforgettable political film, it doesn't get better than ""The Battle of Algiers."" After watching ""The Birth of a Nation"" Lenin commented that cinema is ""History written with lightening.""

507322,4,6302737249,"This gripping film is undergoing a revival because of the American occupation of Iraq.  Based on real events during the Algerian revolt against the French, The Battle of Algiers depicts the insurrection organized in the city of Algiers by militants of the FLN, the Algerian independence movement, and its suppression by the French military.  The story is from a memoir of one the Algerian leaders of the insurrection, who served as co-producer of the movie.  The Battle of Algiers is filmed in a very skilful semi-documentary style with quite a bit of cinematography, an excellent score, and excellent performances from the cast, almost all of whom were amateurs.  Not surprisingly, the Algerian cause is romanticized.  There is no depiction of the considerable strains and conflict within the FLN.  The French civilians are depicted as bigoted (which they were), often callous (which they often were), and privileged (which they were) but this falls short of the whole truth.  A series of French governments had encouraged European immigration to Algeria, and Algeria had a substantial European minority population.  The European population was not just a thin colonial veneer but included significant middle class and working class elements.  Algeria was more like South Africa than most of the other French colonies.
The film's depiction of the main adversary of the insurrection, the paratrooper Col. Mathieu, if not exactly sympathetic, is quite interesting.  He is presented as a highly disciplined professional, honest, a idealistic French patriot, and a man willing to do brutal things to accomplish what he views as noble ends.  In short, he has many of the qualities of the leaders of the insurrection.  The violent acts of both sides are shown unsparingly.
For contemporary Americans, the part of the film that will have the most resonance is the effort of the French to suppress the insurrection.  Methods used by the French will now be familiar to Americans audiences because they have been used in Iraq.  As with the insurgency in Iraq, the key to suppression is obtaining intelligence about the militants committing and organizing violent acts.  The French, unhappily but unblinkingly, resort to systematic torture of suspects.  The word torture, however, is never used.  Mathieu, who is portrayed as remarkably direct and honest with his men, his superiors, the press, and even with the insurrectionists, uses the term ""interrogations"", even as the movie show graphic scenes of torture.  Clearly, the temptation to resort to coercive methods in situations like these is very strong, and perhaps impossible to resist.  While the actions of the American military in Iraq fall well short of the brutal methods used in Algeria, this is a quantitative as opposed to qualitative difference.",1086393600,5,2800,5.251685393258427

Great works of literature speak to all ages. Does the same apply to masterpieces of cinema? The Battle Of Algiers originally came to the United States in 1967. It spoke to that era's inner-city strife and racial tensions, and the escalating campaign in Vietnam. Re-released across America in January 2004, The Battle of Algiers seems even more relevant now. Set in Algeria from 1954-1957, the film portrays the Islamic Algerian nationalist terrorist campaign, organized by the National Liberation Front (NLF), to drive out the French, who had colonized the city Algiers in 1830.
Contemporary journalists and movie reviewers are not the only commentators to have likened the guerilla uprising in Algeria to the current situation in Iraq. On October 28, 2003, former United States National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski said, ""If you want to understand what's going on in Iraq right now, I recommend The Battle of Algiers."" Even the Pentagon screened the film in August of 2003, advertising it with a flyer that stated forebodingly: ""How to win a battle against terrorism and lose the war of ideas. Children shoot soldiers at point-blank range. Women plant bombs in cafes. Soon the entire Arab population builds to a mad fervor. Sound familiar? The French have a plan. It succeeds tactically, but fails strategically. To understand why, come to a rare showing of this film.""
Irrespective of The Battle of Algiers's newfound political salience and contemporary relevance, it is simply a superb work of visual art. Filmed in 1965, the cinematography, which employs hand-held cameras, natural light, and grainy film, is so visually arresting and looks so authentic that the film seems more like a documentary than a dramatization. The archways and rooftop lookouts of the Casbah, the city's old Muslim section, are the film's backdrop. The city's steep, narrow, labyrinth-like streets and winding staircases provide a claustrophobic setting that creates a sense of underlying tension throughout the film. Press interviews, police reports, and United Nations decisions (or rather indecisions) are incorporated into the film to give it a real-time feel of an unfolding drama that could take any drastic turn.
The dialogue of the film is in both French and a Berber dialect of Arabic, with English subtitles. Though the languages are initially distancing to the American ear, they soon prove absorbing. The two languages and their respective modulations, articulations, and tones highlight a cultural divide between the two warring camps. The film's jarring and rhythmic musical score that fuses Arab and western music complements the narrative. The acting in the movie is distinctive and impressive, not because the casting director employed the finest of cinema's movie stars, but rather because the actors are untrained. Taken off the streets of Algeria to play terrorists and their sympathizers, or brought in from France to play young, disciplined conscripts, the casts' facial expressions and voices remain steely and resolute, yet startlingly realistic. The only professional actor in the cast, the lean, attractive French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), who heads the counter-guerrilla operations, exudes an assured, and vibrant charisma that offers an extraordinary counterpoint to his nemesis, the reserved, yet fierce, Algerian, Ali La Point. Played by Brahim Haggiag, this steel-jawed, black-eyed young man literally taken from the streets by the director plays a brooding, illiterate street criminal who works his way up the ranks of the NLF to command a prominent leadership position.
The Algerian guerilla movement has children shoot French policemen in the back and women bomb vibrant cafs in the French district filled with young people. Repugnant though these murders are, the film shades these acts in moral ambiguity, for the cameras also show Algerians humiliated at identification checkpoints, dynamited by French forces in their homes, and interrogated brutally by the French to extract information. Ultimately, the French are successful militarily. By gaining information through torture, the French capture the leadership of the NLF, and decapitate the organization. But four years later, the country erupts in spontaneous rioting and civil disobedience that ultimately forces the French out. The last scene depicting these riots is awesomely powerful. Scores of Algerians surge in the streets, ululating and taunting the overwhelmed French troops. This looks more like a CNN live shot than a staged scene.
Though contemporary writers have been drawing parallels between the situations in Algeria and Iraq, I had the pleasure of speaking with three distinguished Harvard historians who downplayed the parallels between The Battle of Algiers and the current conflict in Iraq. If any ultimate lessons are to be learned from The Battle of Algiers, it is that the logic of military occupation is enormously complex. On the one hand, occupation produces enemies. ""There is no way to occupy a country and a people without creating massive political problems,"" said Professor Keyysar, a professor of history and social policy at the Kennedy School of Government. But pulling out too quickly could provoke civil war, said Ernest May, an international-relations historian. Stanley Hoffman, also an IR historian, told me, ""You can't fight terrorists by pounding cities to pieces.""
Looking back to the consequences of the Algerian war of independence with hindsight, the glory of independence that The Battle Of Algiers portrays now seems marred in the disappointing reality of post-colonial Algeria. On the Algerian side, the war itself cost nearly 500,000 lives from a population of fewer than 9 million. The war culminated in the independence of Algeria from French colonial rule in July 1962. But after the French left, Algeria slid from a secular, nationalistic, post-colonial government, into an authoritarian, corrupt one, culminating it the civil wars of the 1990s that claimed a further 100,000 lives. At the beginning of the 21st century, neither human rights nor democracy have made substantial progress in Algeria. Considering this grim reality, one can only hope that movie-goers in forty years will not be drawing parallels between the archaic Battle of Algiers and the re-released Battle of Baghdad.",1084233600,14,6342,5.426545086119554

507384,5,6302737249,"This is a great film and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's a fairly accurate account of the Battle of Algiers. You really get to see the ugly side of war. However, the movie was financed by the Algerians and if you read Alstair Horne's Savage War of Peace, there are some inaccuracies. First, the movie shows Algerians shooting police. But Horne's points out that most people shot were civilians. Second, the film appears to attribute Ali's death to French explosives. But Horne claims the large explosion was due to a hidden cache of bombs planted by the Algerians. Finally, one of the film's heros Yacef Saadi may be one of the real scoundrels. The films shows an unknown, torture victim to be the one who revealed Ali La Pointe's hiding place. According to the book, The Battle of the Casbah, it was Yacef Saadi who revealed Ali's hiding place. He revealed it freely, without torture. In fairness, Yacuf has denied the charge. So this is just a warning to keep a critical eye open: the film may be slanted in favor of the Algerians.",1076371200,7,1045,4.593582887700535
507385,5,6302737249,"Not many words are needed to describe this movie.  Personally, I would just use one: AMAZING.  Most americans do not understand the views of foreign cultures because we haven't been in the position in history they've been.  This movie takes you to the middle of a heart driven battle. It makes you realize that those who are prisoners are the only ones who truly value freedom, so you get an understanding of why they are willing to beat the odds in order to reach it. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen in my life.  It gives new perspective to actual issues and what is more important it makes you think, and think a lot.
The production of this film is impeccable.  The acting and cinematography is simply brilliant.  You don't even need to undersand exactly what they are saying in order to follow the story-line.  Many of todays cinematographers should sit down and watch this flim. Oh! On the way they should pick up a notepad because they can learn a lot from this master piece.",1076284800,9,997,4.5055555555555555
507386,3,6302737249,"This film dramatically portrays the Battle of Algiers during the Franco-Algierian war of the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It very closely parallels real events and real attitudes (the Algerian decision to kill French civilians, the efforts to launch a general strike, the French military's disdain for the politicians in Paris).

Unfortunately, this film print is terrible.  The images are grainy and often unclear.  Even worse, the subtitles are in white typeface.  Reading white subtitles against a white or black-and-white background is nearly impossible.  If the viewer does not know French and Arabic, he will be lost for much of the film.  Someone desparately needs to re-edit and re-issue this classic.

ADDED LATER: This movie is now available on DVD with improved subtitles and audio quality.  I would highly recommend that version.",1049846400,44,841,5.3106060606060606
507387,5,6302737249,"One of the reviews here (titled 'Black and White and Red All Over') says the movie is ""unflattering in the extreme to the occupying French forces, depicting their brutality and determination without sentimentality"".  This is not true at all.  The Colonel, Matthieu, who masterminds the paratroop operation, is always treated with respect by the scriptwriter and the leaders of the resistance whom he captures.  Matthieu is ruthless but his reasoning is sound.  He exposes the hypocrisy of French public opinion that wanted Algeria to stay French but had qualms about the methods needed to achieve this.  He also points out that many of his paratroopers were anti-Nazi heroes of the resistance.  If Pontecorvo had wanted to make Marxist propaganda, the Colonel would've been a cynical brute with Nazi sympathies.  Instead Pontecorvo has made an extremely even-handed film.  This is its great strength, and the reason why it still rings true 35 years later.  One or two reviewers here have said it's the best political film ever made.  I'm sure it is.  The direction is breathtaking.  The performances, mostly from non-actors, are always totally believable.  And Pontecorvo shows a mastery of suspense that Hitchcock would surely have envied.  I think it's better than this though.  I believe it's a strong candidate for best film ever.",1045353600,23,1334,5.168224299065421
507388,5,6302737249,"This film is a must see, not only as brilliant filmmaking with a riveting story, but also as a very clever, and obviously successful, piece of revisionist propaganda.  Current events have made its message deeply ironic.

France seized Algiers from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, gradually expanding its presence in NW Africa.  By 1954 more than 1 in 10 Algerians were of European descent (pieds-noirs), with 1/3 living in Algiers.  Although France had granted full citizenship to Algerian Jews in 1870, few Moslems had it in 1954.  An Algerian nativist organization, the MTLD, formed during WWII .  An MTLD-led uprising in 1945 was brutally crushed by armed pieds-noirs, and a decade later a more violent nationalist organization, the FLN, splintered from the MTLD to pursue independance.  In 1954, internal fighting between the MTLD and FLN resulted in assassinations of MTLD members in the 'native' section of Algiers, the Casbah, by FLN activists, two of whom were arrested by French authorities.

After being guillotined these men became martyrs for the FLN, which then stepped up its campaign of terrorism, both against its domestic political rivals and the French.  This culminated in the abortive Philippeville uprising in October 1955 when appalling atrocities were committed against Euro-Algerian women and children.  In August of the following year a titanic explosion occurred in a Casbah building reputed to contain an FLN bomb-making workshop.  80 Algerians living in the area were killed, and the FLN blamed the French.  In January 1957 the FLN declared a ceasefire and general strike to demonstrate its political strength.  This proved to be a disastrous tactical error when French paratroops under the command of General Jacques Massu isolated the Casbah and brutally rooted out the FLN network in Algiers.

Except for Philippeville, the events of the 2nd paragraph are covered by the film, which was made under the auspices of the post-colonial (FLN) Algerian government.  Not surprisingly the movie is heavily slanted to the FLN's view of history, but the characters on both sides are interesting and sympathetically portrayed.  This includes the main character, Ali La Pointe, who in real life was a former pimp and sadistic executioner for the Algiers FLN.  The film presents an interesting consideration of counter-terror operations, including a sarcastic take on racial profiling!

It must be added that with the former FLN currently prosecuting a brutal counter-insurgency against election-winning Algerian Fundamentalists, an ironic light is cast on the film's message of respect by the counter-insurgency forces for the heroic insurgents!",1043798400,28,2660,5.384057971014493
507389,5,6302737249,"Edward Said is of the opinion that 'Battle of Algiers' is the greatest political film ever made; paving the way for Salvador, Romero, Platoon and other similar fare, Pontecorvo's Battle is indeed the greatest political film of all-time. In my opinion it's one of the best movies of any genre.

Chronicling an insurrection against the French imperialist colonizers, Battle portrays the reality of the Algerian liberation movement without any hint of romanticization. The particular rebel faction Pontecorvo displays ultimately fail to fulfill their goals, but at the end the viewer realizes they planted the initial seed that lead to success.

With startling similarities to the current U.S. supported Israeli occupation of Palestine, it's unfortunate Pontecorvo never turned his talents in that direction. Especially given that I heard since Battle of Algiers he's had to make a living directing commercials for Italian television.
Obviously the most amazing aspect of the movie is it's starkly authentic looking riot and crowd scenes. Forty years later they still hold up and amaze, and are often mistakenly thought to be composed of actual documentary footage.

Dramas don't come much better than this, do yourself a favor and check it out. The grisly terrorist acts depicted are some of the more disturbing and astounding things you'll see on film.

Pontecorvo's late 1960s Burn! also is fantastic and should probably be viewed right after seeing Battle. The musical scores for both pictures are iresistable and sent me on a frantic search for soundtracks.",1041465600,20,1559,5.32520325203252
507390,4,6302737249,"This is the story of the Algerian struggle for independence from the French between 1954 and 1957.  As the Algerians finally achieved independence in 1962, the government was quite willing to allow the Italian filmmakers to shoot the film in 1965 in the very areas of former battle, especially since it is sympathetic to the fight for freedom. Released in the U.S. in 1967, it has the look and feel of documentary, scenes shot with hand-held cameras, the black and white film purposefully scratchy.  It looks so real that there is a disclaimer at the beginning asserting that it is not a documentary and there was absolutely no newsreel footage used.
All the actors are unknowns, chosen for their authenticity.  There are a lot of close-ups of faces, and the fact that these were real Algerians, with recent memories of the turmoil in their country, certainly comes through.  This is not simply a patriotic paean to the freedom fighters however.  There is terror and loss of life on both sides.  There is one scene where three Algerian women, disguised as French, place bombs around the city.  Innocent lives are lost and the tragedy is not lessened because the women are fighting for a cause.  Wisely, the filmmakers are willing to look at the tragedy without sparing the horror on both sides of the equation.
The characters were only developed in relation to the battle.  I therefore identified with them as a general principle and did not get to experience them as individuals. This was the screenwriter's intent of course.  But it didn't keep my mind glued to the story and I found myself fighting off the desire to doze off as I had to be engaged in reading the English subtitles for the French and Arabic dialogue.  There was one incident after another of bombing, retaliation and torture.  This was certainly not a fun film to watch, which I viewed at Lillian Vernon Center for International Studies in New York where the room was overheated and the hard metal chair uncomfortable.  It  lasted for 117 minutes, which seemed just a little too long to make its point.
""The Battle of Algiers"" is the story of the bloody beginnings of the birth of a nation. Unfortunately, though, the blood bath has continued.  Algeria has been engaged in civil wars almost from its inception.  And there is still no peace there today.",1039219200,16,2322,4.7675
507391,5,6302737249,"The Battle of Algiers should be considered one of the greatest accomplishments of modern cinema. It tells the story of the Algerian struggle for resistance against French colonial rule beginning in the 50's until independence was finally achieved in 1962.
The action is seen through the eyes of a young boxer, turned petty criminal named Ali La Pointe, who becomes one of the leaders of the revolutionary FLN. Yet, La Pointe, despite his importance is only one in a lose association of other revolutionary cells, all working towards the same unimaginable goal: freedom from colonial oppression. Pontecorvo's use of the common people of Algeria in its filming gives the scenes a genuiness and passion bereft of films today. In addition, the use of B&W gives the overall mood a rough and gritty feel harking back to the famous newsreel fare of the 40's and 50's.
Through these methods, which bears a close resemblance to the ideas expressed through the theatre of the oppressed, Pontecorvo is able to capture the uncontrollable surge of revolutionary emotion, in which both sides are portrayed in a way that reveals the ugly face of war. Today's viewer, especially since 9-11, might bristle at the scenes of what many would consider as terrorist attacks by the Algerians, but in the context of this film and the historical realities that it portrays, one is forced to confront the grim realities of Colonial society and the brutalities that ultimately brought about the peoples dedication to the revolutionary cause. Lets not forget that our own American revolutionaries were condemned as barbarians for refusing to fight a ""gentleman's war"".

The Battle of Algiers is a powerful and important film that reveals a chapter in history that many know little about. The fall of Algeria in its global context showed that the European powers were not so omnipotent after all--a realization that inspired downtrodden peoples all over the world. Maybe that is precisely why very few people have heard of it and that the film is currently out-of-print. The story that The Battle of Algiers portrays can be seen as the fruition of Emile Zola's prophetic image of the ""Germinal"": ""Men were springing up, a black avenging host was slowly germinating in the furrows, thrusting upwards for the harvest of future ages. And very soon their germination would crack the earth asunder.""",1024876800,10,2365,5.048593350383632

It depicts the brutuality of both sides. It takes place in algeirs when algerians tried to gain their independance from France. France, who fought like a girl in all the wars and after recently losing indochina tried to prove otherwise and resorted to methods of torture and blowing up houses with people in it in order to keep algeria under its control. The algerians used similar methods by bombing public places killing French and even their own poeple. I think I am giving too much of the plot. Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone whose interested not just in Algeria's war of independance but also in terrorism and independance movements. like one of the reviewer says"" forget Saving Private Ryan"" see "" battle of algiers"".",1010448000,19,887,4.7290322580645165

It has been an indispensable document for students of the Third World from then until now, and now is more pertinent to us all than ever before. As an extra bonus, it has music by Ennio Morricone.

507425,5,6302737249,"Though the movie shows the Algerian war for independence from the Arab side, it is remarkably fair at showing both sides in the confrontation between the Europeans/French and the Arabs.
This is not a good guys vs. bad guys film - it shows the horror and terror of war, particularly the horrors of terrorism against civilians. You watch as the French, the most civilized, cosmopolitan of any Europeans get dragged down to the brutality and hatred of the Arab terrorists (which is the terrorists aim) - then you watch in admiration as the French Army marches in and deals with the situation.
I was rooting for the French army against the terrorists and the politicians back in Paris. This is a good movie to learn about the struggle that America now has with Arab and Muslim terrorists. One must be as tough and as brutal as the terrorists, but also keep the honor, civilized standards of our higher culture.
I highly recommend this film. Perhaps the director will do a new film on the horrible state of Algeria now that it is ruled by the Arabs - Islamic fundamentalist terrorism - the carnage goes on today.",1001721600,27,1107,4.653061224489796

Battle of Algiers tells the story of how the racism and division between the French and her former colonies came into existence. Today there is a lot of animosity against former colonies and immigrants in France and to see a film such as Battle of Algiers is mind boggling, yet thought provoking.
