My only criticism is that I would not recommend it to someone completely new to yoga.  If you have some background and understand the way the breath is connected to the movement, this is a good choice.  If you have been instructed in yoga before and know the subtle details important for each pose, this is a good choice.  It felt to me that the instructor assumes prior knowledge of yoga poses and breathing.

I like the fact that you can omit the instruction and change the music. You feel like you are in a real yoga class.

First, the DVD would not work on 2 of the 3 DVD players we have in the house.  I found the speakers voice to low and words were difficult to understand. There were no instructions on positions and or whys and wherefores on this DVD for beginners.  Honestly, I found AM Yoga on Exercise TV much more beneficial and helpful.  It only lasts for 10 minutes which is great for us that are in no way, shape, or form exercise fanatics.  So I'm off to try a different Yoga DVD!",1215993600,,630,4.122950819672131

As a beginning yoga instructor-in-training I can watch and learn from Jennifer's technique. I like how she included a diverse cast of yogis to really show people that yoga CAN have variations depending on your body type and comfort level. My clients say they could identify with the people in this video. Finally, a DVD that truly is for every body!",1210982400,,487,4.741176470588235
3154573,5,B0016A6YTE,"After a friend introduced me to The Vinyasa Flow Yoga I purchased it and I have been using it every other day since I received it. I am a beginner / intermediate and this tape fits perfectly.

It gives you the option of choosing from 6-8 sound settings: ranging from tranquil music to upbeat music to having no music at all, just the instructor's voice.

3154577,5,B0016A6YTE,"If you have to buy only one Vinyasa Yoga video, this is the only one you'll ever need!  Simple instructions on beneficial body movements are presented in a clear and entertaining fashion.  As a beginner Yoga student, I can say that Jennifer made it easy to learn.  She is an expert as well as an expert teacher.

I found Vinyasa Flow Yoga to be the perfect solution for the person who wants the benefits of expert instruction but is too busy to travel for it. What makes this video superior to all others is its presentation and quality of information.  Who would have thought it could be so much fun to relieve stress through Flow Yoga!",1208736000,,637,4.456896551724138

Whether you are a beginner or an advanced student, or somewhere in between, you'll find inspiration in Jennifer's approach. It's great having two soundtracks to choose from--one slow with more instruction, and one quicker-paced. The beautiful natural setting and cinematography also enchance the teaching.",1208736000,,474,5.690140845070423

I really recommend this DVD for many people from beginners to advanced learners. The reason is that this DVD gives us nice relaxation and great exercise.

Enjoy this DVD!",1208563200,2,443,4.620253164556962
3154581,5,B0016A6YTE,"They really named this one right.  The flow of movement is simple and very soothing for a true mind/body experience.  Jennifer explains things well and inspires us to do better each time we watch the video and listen to the pose desciptions.  The poses are suitable for beginners, yet can be adapted for the more experienced pracitioner.  Then, when we feel as though we have it down pat we can switch to the other sound tracks that allow us to hear the pose names along with different background music.  It is like having three products in one.  The scenery and camera angles are interesting to watch and a relaxing experience without even doing a workout.  I recommend this video for someone looking to get started with Yoga, or for someone wanting a great practice at home.",1208563200,4,776,4.661764705882353
3154582,5,B0016A6YTE,"After searching the net for an entry level vinyasa yoga dvd, I've finally found the one that I believe has met all my needs. It isn't overwhelming for my beginner instincts, and goes at a pace that does not leave me wondering how I got into a certain position. I love the fact that you can choose different soundtracks and believe this is the only vinyasa yoga dvd where that is an option. Jennifer's voice compliments each one of the styles of music and is very clear and easy to understand.

I am no longer intimidated by this unique art of yoga and have shared my thoughts of this dvd with many friends who in turn have enjoyed it as well. I would suggest this vinyasa yoga dvd to anyone who doesnt want to be constricted by a redundant soundtrack and want to learn this type of yoga that flows like the Foz Do Iguacu.",1208563200,2,821,4.296774193548387
3154583,5,B0016A6YTE,"As a teacher I'm always looking for ways to wind down and relax after work (preferably ways that don't involve mass consumption of alcohol!)  I tried a Vinyasa yoga class with a friend and really enjoyed it, but it was a little too expensive to be a regular thing.  I thought a yoga DVD would be an affordable way to try out my new hobby.

When looking for a yoga video, I tried to find one that would be good for a beginner (and I do mean beginner) like me, but also would still be useful once I got the hang of it.  I chose Simple and Sweet because it looked like just what the title implied!  It wasn't until after I received the video that I realized that you could change the soundtrack - there are different music selections and also different levels of verbal instructions.  Genius!  The first couple times I used the DVD I listened to the detailed instructions so I would be sure to get the poses right.  But now I just need the names of the poses and I'm good to go.  The different music choices make it a completely different experience each time (good for me, I get bored easily.)

The setting is beautiful - a sunset in beautiful San Diego, California.  The narrator's voice is lovely and soothing.  The poses are easy to get the hang of and they show modified versions for the less flexible crowd.  I have no complaints!

I have found that this video has helped me feel more relaxed and yet also more energized.  I think I'm going to buy these DVDs for my teacher friends for their birthdays.  Some of them really need to relax.",1208563200,30,1541,4.317073170731708

I highly recommend it!,1208563200,,328,4.39344262295082
3154585,5,B0016A6YTE,I finally found a yoga video that I want to watch more than once!  There are great features that allow you to change the music and instruction.  I am finally getting into a yoga routine with this video!  The setting of this video is also particularly beautiful.  I can really picture myself practicing yoga with the sun setting in front of me!  I definitely recommend it!,1208563200,2,371,4.5606060606060606
3154586,5,B0016A6YTE,This was a really awesome DVD. For beginners and experienced practitioners it's really an excellent guide that makes yoga more interesting and fun with great music. Try it and you will love it. I'd highly recommend it.,1208563200,,218,4.918918918918919

3154588,5,B0016A6YTE,"Being a beginner to yoga, I was a bit intimidated by the number of books and dvds out there. This one was suggested to me by a friend and I love love love it. The ""anyone can do yoga"" is really true.

I've really improved a lot using this dvd and feel I have a much stronger foundation than ever.

Jennifer's voice is very soothing and kept my attention. I always feel energized and challenged and walk away so refreshed. This is definitely a keeper compared to all the others I've tried.

As a wave surfer, it's important for me to be flexible and have good endurance... this Vinyasa Yoga dvd... a total winner!",1208563200,3,612,4.350877192982456
3154589,5,B0016A6YTE,Jennifer Tiption is a wonderful Yoga instructor.  I have experience with others but Jennifer has set the bar.

Also, I was so impressed to find out that all of the people on the video are actually from the instructor's class!  That really goes to show that she knows what she's doing, and that you don't need professionals to show us how it's done!  Since I'm not extremely advanced at yoga, this was so encouraging to me!

First, the DVD would not work on 2 of the 3 DVD players we have in the house.  I found the speakers voice to low and words were difficult to understand. There were no instructions on positions and or whys and wherefores on this DVD for beginners.  Honestly, I found AM Yoga on Exercise TV much more beneficial and helpful.  It only lasts for 10 minutes which is great for us that are in no way, shape, or form exercise fanatics.  So I'm off to try a different Yoga DVD!",1215993600,,630,4.122950819672131

As a beginning yoga instructor-in-training I can watch and learn from Jennifer's technique. I like how she included a diverse cast of yogis to really show people that yoga CAN have variations depending on your body type and comfort level. My clients say they could identify with the people in this video. Finally, a DVD that truly is for every body!",1210982400,,487,4.741176470588235

The production is wonderful and most importantly, I feel much better after just using it for just one week. I have purchased several Yoga and exercise videos and this is the best Yoga video I have seen so far.

It gives you the option of choosing from 6-8 sound settings: ranging from tranquil music to upbeat music to having no music at all, just the instructor's voice. I really like that I can choose a sound setting according to my yoga mood. This feature is GREAT! It feels like I'm attending a NEW yoga class EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK! I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes variety in their workout :)",1209168000,,466,4.306818181818182

Simple instructions on beneficial body movements are presented in a clear and entertaining fashion.  As a beginner Yoga student, I can say that Jennifer made it easy to learn.  She is an expert as well as an expert teacher.

I found Vinyasa Flow Yoga to be the perfect solution for the person who wants the benefits of expert instruction but is too busy to travel for it. What makes this video superior to all others is its presentation and quality of information.  Who would have thought it could be so much fun to relieve stress through Flow Yoga!",1208736000,,637,4.456896551724138

Whether you are a beginner or an advanced student, or somewhere in between, you'll find inspiration in Jennifer's approach. It's great having two soundtracks to choose from--one slow with more instruction, and one quicker-paced.

Jennifer explains things well and inspires us to do better each time we watch the video and listen to the pose desciptions.  The poses are suitable for beginners, yet can be adapted for the more experienced pracitioner.  Then, when we feel as though we have it down pat we can switch to the other sound tracks that allow us to hear the pose names along with different background music.  It is like having three products in one.  The scenery and camera angles are interesting to watch and a relaxing experience without even doing a workout.

It isn't overwhelming for my beginner instincts, and goes at a pace that does not leave me wondering how I got into a certain position. I love the fact that you can choose different soundtracks and believe this is the only vinyasa yoga dvd where that is an option. Jennifer's voice compliments each one of the styles of music and is very clear and easy to understand.

I am no longer intimidated by this unique art of yoga and have shared my thoughts of this dvd with many friends who in turn have enjoyed it as well. I would suggest this vinyasa yoga dvd to anyone who doesnt want to be constricted by a redundant soundtrack and want to learn this type of yoga that flows like the Foz Do Iguacu.",1208563200,2,821,4.296774193548387
3389080,5,B0016A6YTE,"As a teacher I'm always looking for ways to wind down and relax after work (preferably ways that don't involve mass consumption of alcohol!)  I tried a Vinyasa yoga class with a friend and really enjoyed it, but it was a little too expensive to be a regular thing.  I thought a yoga DVD would be an affordable way to try out my new hobby.

When looking for a yoga video, I tried to find one that would be good for a beginner (and I do mean beginner) like me, but also would still be useful once I got the hang of it.  I chose Simple and Sweet because it looked like just what the title implied!  It wasn't until after I received the video that I realized that you could change the soundtrack - there are different music selections and also different levels of verbal instructions.  Genius!  The first couple times I used the DVD I listened to the detailed instructions so I would be sure to get the poses right.  But now I just need the names of the poses and I'm good to go.  The different music choices make it a completely different experience each time (good for me, I get bored easily.)

The setting is beautiful - a sunset in beautiful San Diego, California.  The narrator's voice is lovely and soothing.  The poses are easy to get the hang of and they show modified versions for the less flexible crowd.  I have no complaints!

I have found that this video has helped me feel more relaxed and yet also more energized.  I think I'm going to buy these DVDs for my teacher friends for their birthdays.  Some of them really need to relax.",1208563200,30,1541,4.317073170731708

I highly recommend it!,1208563200,,328,4.39344262295082

I've really improved a lot using this dvd and feel I have a much stronger foundation than ever.

Jennifer's voice is very soothing and kept my attention. I always feel energized and challenged and walk away so refreshed. This is definitely a keeper compared to all the others I've tried.

As a wave surfer, it's important for me to be flexible and have good endurance... this Vinyasa Yoga dvd... a total winner!",1208563200,3,612,4.350877192982456

Also, I was so impressed to find out that all of the people on the video are actually from the instructor's class!  That really goes to show that she knows what she's doing, and that you don't need professionals to show us how it's done!  Since I'm not extremely advanced at yoga, this was so encouraging to me!

8261820,5,B0016A6YTE,"This DVD comes with an instructional practice and an asana timing practice.  I really loved the asana timing option of this DVD.  No need for chatter or too much instruction. The teacher just cues you when it is time to move to the next pose by just saying the name of the asana.  Nice for those of us who don't need instruction on how to get in and out of asanas.  With that, 99% of the DVD is silent (except for the music, if you choose music, which you don't have to).  For me this is great to help me get more into the zone of my breathing and meditation, and be less in the critical mind.  All DVD's should have this option.  For me, it makes for a deeper practice!  ~Namaste~",1272067200,3,681,4.106060606060606

I bought DVD after DVD (Rodney Yee, Ana Brett, Mark Blanchard, to name a few) and was SO disappointed.  There was always something lacking for me and I ended up selling them on Ebay.  I realize everyone has their own preference in style, but the flow, poses, music and length of holds are important to me, and I like Kest's style.  I thought I was going to be limited to Bryan's few workouts until now.  This DVD is WONDERFUL!!!  Very similar in flow to Bryan Kest, but what can I say?  I now have choices in music and choices in how much instruction I want.  My new to yoga boyfriend loves this workout also.  I find the flow similar to Bryan Kest Power Yoga 2, but not alot of twisting poses.  We were both very impressed with the final relaxation at the end.  I am very pleased and highly recommend!
