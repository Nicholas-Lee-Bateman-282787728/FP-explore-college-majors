4989241,5,B006H5OAGC,"One of the best baseball movies of all time. But there's more to it than that.  This movie is not only a baseball story, but a love story.  It's about the love Lou Gehrig has for his family, his wife, and baseball.  Gary Cooper turns in an outstanding performance as Lou Gehrig.  Gehrig was the star first baseman for the New York Yankees who died at an early age from a debilitating disease, ALS, aka Lou Gehrig's disease.  This movie chronicles the life... and death of one the games greatest players.  While certain parts of the movie aren't true to life, it doesn't affect the essence of the story.  A must have for any baseball fan.  Even if you HATE the New York Yankees, you will LOVE this movie.  Even if you don't like baseball, you will like this movie.  This movie IS that good.",984787200,18,789,4.379310344827586

4989247,1,B006H5OAGC,Just terrible....took a chance but just watch the Gary Cooper version. One of the best baseball movies ever. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pride_of_the_Yankees,1428105600,,162,7.578947368421052
4989248,2,B006H5OAGC,"You want ""The Pride of the Yankees"" not this one.  This is a TV special.",1427500800,,72,3.8
4989249,2,B006H5OAGC,Two stars at best.,1419465600,,18,3.75
4989250,2,B006H5OAGC,Just not a very high quality production. The acting wasn't the highest caliber. I did somewhat enjoy the vintage commercials.,1409702400,,125,5.3
4989251,1,B006H5OAGC,It was ok it has no closed captioned,1408579200,,36,3.625
4989252,4,B006H5OAGC,Ends with his famous speech at Yankee Stadium. So what happened afterwards? How much longer did he live? Kind of leaves you hanging in a way..,1408492800,,142,4.5

4989254,4,B006H5OAGC,"While it was a cast of B actors, it was well performed and would recommend to viewers who have an interest in the iconic Lou Gehrig. Well done.",1400025600,,143,4.142857142857143
4989255,4,B006H5OAGC,"Was a pretty good story, but not as good as the Hollywood version. Still was an interesting version. Still worth watching.",1382313600,,122,4.857142857142857
4989256,4,B006H5OAGC,"Having just watched ""TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE"" and living with MS myself,Lou Gehrig's account was a bit softened. His decisions & dynamics were very brave in an unacceptable situation & diagnosis. ALS was somewhat masked by other diseases with no notoriety. MS doesn't shut the organs down so I've had similar experiences over 30 years. I now live in a care facility,AKA Skilled Nursing Home,so my symptoms are monitored & medicated as they occur. Lou Gehrig was a Nationally acclaimed hero being watched under a microscope. His decisions where not his wish but his living nightmare.

I found ""The Lou Gehrig story explained his demise in a way unknown to the baseball followers.",1381708800,,675,5.026785714285714
4989257,4,B006H5OAGC,"Interesting and informative. We liked the movie Pride of the Yankees so we thought we would try the biography, filled in some gaps.",1377216000,,131,4.739130434782608
4989258,5,B006H5OAGC,"I enjoy sports, and I really enjoy baseball.

This had many pictures of the old stadium, and the fans.

I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes sports.",1376006400,,161,4.517241379310345
4989259,2,B006H5OAGC,"I am a HUGE Lou Gehrig fan, but this movie is bad quality and acting....watch Pride of The Yankees instead.....",1369180800,,111,4.6
4989260,2,B006H5OAGC,"A bit disappointing in that it seems to just gloss over this disease. The movie centers around a few days before he decides to bench himself and see a doctor, to SORT OF getting the diagnosis from the doctor (done in a very read between the lines of what I'm not saying) and then the day at the ballpark where he gives his famous speech - and I'm not sure it was even all of his speech, though it looked like it could've been an actual clip from the moment.  This movie doesn't go into the progression of the disease, what he did with himself once he quit baseball, how long he lasted until it killed him...

Also - the actress who plays his wife (Jean Hagen) stunk.  She was constantly blinking fast and making stupid looking faces (though maybe that was just her face).

Not a top notch movie...but it was ok. Unfortunately, this is the only movie on Lou Gehrig that Amazon seems to offer.

I would suggest instead that you watch the movie ""The Pride of the Yankees (1942)"" starring Gary Cooper (not available on Amazon at this time). There is another movie on him out there (also not on Amazon video but avail. for purchase as VHS) that I haven't seen yet, but hope to, entitled: ""A Love Affair: the Eleanor and Lou Gehrig story"" starring Blythe Danner as Eleanor.",1345766400,3,1267,4.397435897435898

8498208,5,B006H5OAGC,My brother-in-law died of Lou Gehrig disease.  I wanted more information and this answered many questions.,1524009600,,106,5.625
8498209,1,B006H5OAGC,"This wasn't even true!  My husband has ALS and if hot coffee is spilled on him it will BURN HIM AND HE WOULD FEEL IT
 Many years ago I saw a very good movie on Lou Gehrig and his fight with ALS",1488844800,,193,3.5714285714285716
8498210,2,B006H5OAGC,"Not even close to the Pride of the Yankees, I would never watch this again.",1485820800,,75,4.066666666666666

8498212,2,B006H5OAGC,I thought ''tis was the one played by jimmy stuart,1476403200,,50,4.1
8498213,3,B006H5OAGC,Old news from time when version would be sanitized and made palatable to the public. I admire Lou Gehrig but would have liked to know more about the real him.,1462320000,,158,4.3
8498214,2,B006H5OAGC,"It was very different movie style one which I am not used to.  So the movie did not make my top 10,000 movie list.",1461715200,,114,3.75
8498215,5,B006H5OAGC,great old fashioned classic  a true hero!!!!!!!!!,1461024000,,49,6.0
8498216,2,B006H5OAGC,"Wasn't nearly as inspiring as ""the pride and of the Yankees"" movie.  But the actors did the best they could givin the limited budget and weak script.",1461024000,,149,4.518518518518518
