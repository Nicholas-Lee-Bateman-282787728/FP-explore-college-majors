722911,5,6303593720,"The Color of Pomegranates (made in 1968, and also released under the name Sayat Nova) is not really a conventional movie. It is more like a series of tableaux ""inspired"" by 18th century Armenian poet Nova. It is nonetheless fascinating, and should be required viewing for anybody interested not only in Armenian culture but in cinema in general (or, if you wish, the visual arts). This movie has inspired many artists, including some music videos (admittedly not among the arts' highest form), including REM's ""Losing my Religion"" and Deep Forest's ""Sweet Lullaby"". There is a heavy homoerotic subtext to many of the tableaux, and as a matter of fact, Paradjanov would later spent several years in jail in the Soviet Union accused, among other things, of homosexuality. Though released under international pressure, it would take him another 16 years to make another movie, shortly before his untimely death in 1990.",1175904000,3,916,5.113333333333333
722912,5,6303593720,"This is one of those films that you can't make any literal sense about it.  It's all images.  It's like Fellini's Satyricon, Greenaway's Prospero's Books, and, to a lesser extent, Argento's Inferno.  But WHAT IMAGES!  This is a magnificent, breathtaking beautiful, poetic, painterly masterpiece.  You could freeze any frame of this, and they would look like medeval paintings come to life.  Paradjanov did not make many films (the Soviet authorities made life a living hell for him because of his outspoken views on politics and his nationalistic leanings), but the ones that he did will always live.  No one in this world made films like he does.  They are so unique in world cinema.  This is an abstract film about the Armenian poet Sayat Nova.  It is not a literal biographical film.  It is a film that enters into the poet's world.  Many have complained about the transfer by Kino.  It is not great, but the fact that this film has survived at all is a miracle in itself.  And it's Paradjanov's original cut too.  The conditions in which it was made were not very good, so it is possible that the film stock Paradjanov shot on was defective, or very worn.  One little known problem with Soviet filmmaking was that many crews had to share equipment with each other, and that it wasn't the greatest to begin with.  That might be why the film looks faded and old.  But the fact that we have it is magnificent enough.  The documentary, Paradjanov: A Requiem, is very good.  It is not filled with talking heads analyzing Paradjanov's films and life.  Most of the film features Paradjanov himself.  It contains the final interview he did.  He is fully alive and very boisterous during the whole film.  He is still very outspoken about life in the USSR (which was falling apart by the time this film was made), and he is just amazing to behold.  The film has clips from many of Paradjanov's early work, none of which has ever been released here.  This is definitely worth picking up.",1162252800,5,1980,4.6502890173410405
722913,5,6303593720,"Its unfortunate that there are some bad reviews of this DVD. I suspect that KINO's bad reputation precedes them here. They are, of course, well-known for dishing out a terrible print and charging an arm and a leg for it. This is certainly the case with their Legend of the Suram Fortress/Ashik Kerib release. Those are inexcusably bad.

It is not true of The Color of Pomegranates. For once, KINO has done right, and the negative criticism, I think, is just plain wrong for the most part. This is a film made in the 60s in the Soviet Union by a Georgian film-maker that was cut and then later banned. The chances of a print like this surviving are pretty slim; that it has survived, and in such good condition, is a miracle.

A cleaner, less washed-out print of this film is known, and has been released on DVD in other Regions. What makes KINO's release remarkable, however, is that unlike those releases, KINO's version is Parajanov's original cut of the film, which resurfaced in the West in the 80s.

Other than the colors being a little washed, the image on this disc is extremely clean and clear. The audio suffers at bits, but it isn't terribly distracting. The only real drawback is KINO's consistent problem with burnt subtitles; its impossible to remove those gaudy yellow tags from the image. Fortunately, this is a film with very little dialogue, most of which is spoken over intertitles, so its not a huge drawback.

Beyond that, KINO deserves a lot of praise for serving up some really outstanding extras. A ten-minute short by Parajanov, ""Hagop Hovnatanian"" is included, also looking quite nice. The short consists mostly of still-photography of paintings and objects; it may have been pulled together from one of projects Parajanov was forced to abandon before Pomegranates.

The second extra is an hour long film, completed just after Parajanov's death. This is worth the price alone for Parajanov fans. Most of the film is narrated by Parajanov himself, from one of his last interviews, put together beautifully with footage from his films, many of them rarely seen. I can't stress what a great documentary this is: Parajanov speaks candidly about his troubled career, his time in prison, the avant-garde in Russian film, his admiration of Dovzhenko and Pasolini (""he is a god to me""), and much more.

Anyway, pick this up without reservation. Credit where credit is due: KINO has put together a great disc here.",1153958400,16,2430,4.829326923076923
722914,5,6303593720,"Don't expect plot, character development, and all the rest. I first saw this movie in college and was captivated by the way Paradzhanov used the film medium to ""convey"" (not tell, really) a story through a series of tableaux vivants. In fact, I was so captivated that I fell asleep about half-way into the movie. We had a lecture _after_ the movie by an Armenian professor explaining the imagery and motifs, but it would have helped to know all that _before_ the movie started, to have some kind of mental framework to help guide me through the movie. Still, the movie stands up to multiple viewings, and gets better as you remember things and can anticipate the development that there is. It's a successful experiment, but not one that has been successfully reproduced, that I know of.

And incidentally Armenians are not Muslims. In fact, they were they first nation to accept Christianity, in 301.",1132617600,3,900,4.806451612903226
722915,5,6303593720,"The print is not great but then again I doubt KINO could have afforded to do a full restoration based on 2000-tops sales at $15 a clip wholesale, if even. We're lucky to have this at all.

A beautiful film--I will never forget the non-linear, dreamlike magic from my first viewing years ago.

I notice a resident of Seattle thinks that the director pretty much deserved to be sent to a gulag for his work, and seemingly for his sexual preferences too. Hmmm. The movie seemed to summon up something hateful in at least one viewer. Democracy being what it is, a ""Report This"" seems in order and I'm sure if Amazon gets a lot of them perhaps the offending comments will evaporate. I only admire the right of free speech when someone has something, let's say, intelligent to say.",1123372800,8,775,4.5285714285714285
722916,2,6303593720,"This is a very boring piece of 'art' which does nothing to a person living in the west. Unless you are muslim or wear a scarf around your face, then you won't be at all interested in this pretentious piece of poetry from the bloated and overrated director Sergei Parajanov. It deals with some Armenian poet who wrote under the influence of opium and the film is a testament to the visions he saw. In art direction, and sets, there are passable glimpses, but so what, if it bores us out of our minds or if there is no story involved, then why do we care if we see implacably designed sets?

I had a hard time sitting through it and had to forward it because it was just too much. I think Fellini had a better mood in ""Satryican"" because he emphasized not only set design but at least some method of story telling, however disfigured. But Parajanov, who hails from the mountain regions of the Caucasus, is so accustomed to Soviet film making, which is quite vapid and slow moving, that he does nothing to engage our senses. If I were at a play, then at least I'd attempt to be polite but I must say that this is horrible. An extra on the DVD is Parajanov being interviewed in which he states that, ""a director is born"", and shows his elitist self. Then there are clips of him from annoying art festivals from europe, hailing him as the next messiah of film, its all very insipid for non-Parajanov fans.",1101859200,4,1400,4.343511450381679
722917,5,6303593720,"The first images I saw in Pomegranates left me thinking, ""there's no way the director can keep this up throughout the whole film!""
He can and he does.
The entire film is made up of nothing but poetic images.  Acting is almost a non-issue; the only thing the actors in this movie have to worry about is keeping a straight face while staring straight ahead and not moving their heads.  The images are often beautiful and striking in their artificiality, but this will no doubt prove to be overkill for many viewers...  this is definitely not a film to buy blindly; I reccommend seeing it somewhere else first, like in a library.  Personally, the images kept me interested.  Each one seems to be an allegory for something real (the movie is, after all, designed to be an abstract representation of a poet's mind), but while some of the allegories are quite easy to figure out (ie. young Nova picking up a book in one scene, then in the next scene he's surrounded by hundreds of huge books, their pages flapping in the wind), others are very difficult.  It would be very nice for me to have a special commentary feature on a dvd where somebody explains what each scene is supposed to represent.
The best way to see this movie is definetely on a big screen on the original 35mm film... the VHS version that I had (Director's Cut released by CONNOISSEUR VIDEO COLLECTION) simply SCREAMED to me for greater detail; Paradjanov doesn't always zoom in on important small details, and the picture quality on the VHS was like all VHSs a bit fuzzy.  From what I heard, the Kino DVD isn't much better, so I don't really know what options there are.
(...).
I'd like to point out that for one thing, we don't SEE the lamb get slaughtered; the knife is brought to its neck and then we see the hanging dead body of a lamb.  Also, this may come as a surprize to some people, but in the real world lambs actually DO GET slaughtered.  Is it better to turn a blind eye to things we don't like, while hypocritically continuing to eat meat?  As for the allegations of a homoerotic scene, I think that it's a bit of a stretch.  All we see really is one man walking on top of another's back... certainly nothing even remotely pornographic.
The only ""innaproproate"" thing I noticed is one scene where a woman's breast is shown.
Anyway, I personally liked this film better than Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.  The music wasn't as annoying (bagpipe-like instruments do become annoying after a while), and it seemed to me that Parajanov's final forsaking of the story form was a step in the right direction; in ""Shadows"" I always felt like the story wasn't being told and I wasn't getting to know the characters. Here, since the film is purely symbolic, I didn't feel such a void.
One more thing: in the edition that I saw, almost half of the dialogue is not translated with subtitles!  This seems to me to be a very poor effort, either that or there's STILL a conspiracy to censor some things in the film for non-Armenian viewers.
Overall, this is reccommended for those who like Tarkovsky (who was a friend of Parajanov), poetry, or have an interest in Armenia... or for those who want to see something REALLY strange! (although the latter variety, while initially finding it very interesting, will probably not be able to sit through the whole film ;) )",1097280000,6,3327,4.571428571428571
722918,5,6303593720,"In my opinion the dvd is quite good, it is a miracle that Paradjanov's troubled masterpiece even survived. I agree that the video transfer could have been better but one must remember the bad conditions and problems the film went through. I disagree with the reviewer from Texas who is very negative himself/herself but claims that comments of paradjanov website are negative and I believe the website's point is most appropriate. As far as translation, I find nothing awkward with singular translation of ""pomegranate"" plus if Paradjanov intended it that way then why modify his title. This is one of my favorite films and I hope more people will see it.",1075939200,16,655,4.90990990990991
722919,5,6303593720,"One really has to dig VERY deep into the metaphorical bag to be able to convincingly say that there are homoerotic undertones to this film. And yes, there is a decapitated ram in one scene, but for all one knows, it could have been a nice piece of taxidermy work. But I suppose anyone touchy enough to be offended at that would find taxidermy itself offensive. Anyway, that's not to say that Color of Pomegranates is for everyone. It's slow, so you need a good attention span, and its compositions are eclectic and mysterious, so you also need a good sense for the mysterious and the beautiful. It doesn't follow a typical narrative structure, so those looking for something to hold on to will be left lost. Mostly, Color is a love letter to Armenia; its culture, religion, language, literature, etc. However, it is also a glimpse into the wonderful mind-world of Paradjanov. Those familiar with Armenia and its culture are likely to be at a loss to categorise this film as well, and will have to sit back with the rest of us and let Paradjanov's dazzling imagery sink in like a fine wine.
I wish Kino would do a better job with their DVD transfers. It's better than the VHS tape, but really, they could have cleaned the film up considerably, as well as offered some special features. The Paradjanov documentary is nice, though it's really presented more as two films on one DVD, rather than as a special feature. Removable subtitles and a new translation would have been nice, too. Kino really needs to give these to Criterion to see what they can dig up. I'm sure it would be spectacular, as usual.
Parajanov.com is such a negative reviewer, and is very picky. Color of POMEGRANATE does not translate well in english. It's obvious this is not your first language, so don't make translation suggestions if you aren't experienced. In English, when a color's name is directly ascribed to a common item, rather than given a direct name, that item's plural is used. This is different in other languages, where that item's singular is often used. Thus the title ""Color of Pomegranate,"" while more true to the original language, is awkward compared to the correct English rendition of ""Color of Pomegranates.""
Chill out and take some translation courses!",1073174400,14,2249,4.754475703324808

722996,1,6303593720,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, as I found Paranjanov's Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors to be fascinatingly otherworldly.  I also wanted to expand the internationality of my film collection by adding an Armenian film.  I was also interested in learning something about Armenia and the Armenian people.  If you have similar interests, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  I knew this was an ""art"" film, and I tried desperately to keep an open mind, however I could not stomach watching this without the aid of the FF button.  To me this film was quite simply utter trash.  I am not easy to offend; for example I really enjoyed Harvey Keitel in the Bad Lieutenant.  I think I was most sickened by the scenes (implied or actual) of animal abuse.  To be fair, I do think some people can enjoy it, however I think at least three of the following four conditions would have to be met:
1) be a fan of poetry with an interest in Armenia
2) enjoy homo-erotic human mosaic
3) enjoy cruelty to animals
4) enjoy art films with little formal plot structure
Tragically, Parajanov was sent to the gulag for making this film, apparently on trumped up charges of homosexuality.  Watching this film, its not hard to see where the Soviets got the idea.  I wanted to give this film two star in respect for Parajanov, but really one star is sufficiently generous in this case.  Perhaps the lesson of this film is that some feelings are better left surpressed. I cannot understand why this Parajanov film is available on DVD but not his far superior Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.",1069804800,10,1567,4.641304347826087

It is almost immoral that they should have the rights to release this film but it seems that they are not capable of taking this responsibility seriously. I love DVDs, but this makes me want to cry - not because I wasted my money (which I did) but because a work of art has been treated so badly. The VHS copy I own is of much higher quality.

722999,4,6303593720,"Kino has finally released THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES on DVD, together with Ron Holloway's documentary film PARADJANOV: A REQUIEM. I previously reviewed the VHS version of POMEGRANATES, so rather than discuss the content, I'll restrict my comments to the quality of the DVD presentation for that film.
The video transfer for THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES doesn't look bad, especially with the enhanced sharpness of the DVD format, bringing out details and textures that weren't as clear before. Clearly, DVD is the way to go here. Having seen the film in a stunning 35mm print recently, I suspect that the video transfer could be a lot better. Certainly, the Japanese and British videocassettes of the film have richer color. However, to be fair, THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES has a complicated production and preservation history.
From what I understand, the so-called ""Director's Cut"" (which is in fact just the official Armenian release version) doesn't survive in the original negative. The camera negative was cut to make the Russian version re-edited by Sergei Yutkevitch. This probably explains why the prints I've seen of the Russian version have better color. The version which Kino has released, while it's not quite as strong visually, is clearly closer to what Paradjanov originally intended in terms of content. On the positive side, Kino's video is ""windowboxed,"" meaning that there are black bars around the edges of the film, assuring that you see the maximum possible picture from the original frame. The short film ""Hakob Hovnatanian,"" included as an extra on the DVD, is windowboxed as well.
The accompanying documentary film PARADJANOV: A REQUIEM is a mixed bag. Director Ron Holloway combines an interview with Paradjanov with footage from Paradjanov's films, providing a basic overview of his work. Paradjanov loved to show off in front of the camera and speaks in a forthright manner, making him a great interview subject, even if you have to take some of what he says with a grain of salt. For American viewers, one of the virtues of this documentary is its clips from Paradjanov's rarely-seen Ukrainian films made before SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS, as well as the unfinished project KIEV FRESCOES.
The downside is that the documentary has numerous factual errors and is sloppily put together at times. At one point, when Paradjanov is talking about ASHIK KERIB, Holloway confusingly inserts footage of THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES. At another point Holloway states (roughly) ""Fragments are all that remain of HAKOB HOVNATANIAN and KIEV FRESCOES."" This is simply not true. ""Hakob Hovnatanian"" is a one-reel documentary short, and it survives in its complete form. The surviving material for KIEV FRESCOES is a fifteen minute short, complete with a soundtrack, which Paradjanov himself had edited together from the screen tests to show officials when he was trying to make the film, a kind of sketch to suggest the overall look and feel of the finished product. Paradjanov never got to produce the actual film, but the short survives in its entirety. A little more fact checking on Holloway's would have helped. Still, the documentary is worth seeing on the whole. The visual quality is just fine for films of this type.
Kino's DVD of THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES may not be perfect, but it's more than acceptable, and it's a good deal with the added bonus of the documentary film.",987724800,48,3392,5.091561938958708
723000,5,6303593720,"Arguably the best movie with images in cinematography, Parajanov's ""The Color of a Pomegranate"" depicts inner life and spiritual quest of Haroutyun Sayadian known as Sayat Nova, Armenian ashough (troubadour). Parajanov takes us through the set of images from Armenian everyday life: wedding at the church, lamb sacrifice, bath house, where a child begins his discovery of the female body... Like enriched colors on a canvas, Sayat Nova's life is presented in images from his childhood work as an apprentice to departing his home and becoming an ashough. Parajanov draws each scene of the movie like a painter with a colorful palette. ""Krak es doo, sev e qo hagine""- the lines that repeat time and time again from Sayat Nova's poetry. It's a song about love and about death.
What is this? Life of a famous troubadour as Parajanov sees it... or simply his own memories... Yes, it can be and it is widely accepted as one of the most colorful masterpieces in cinematography. But I believe this movie can be felt only by those who have been exposed to the Armenian life and to those who know how symbolic to our nation the colors of pomegranates are...
On a more historical note: the movie was shot in 1969 and was originally called ""Sayat Nova"". Before releasing, Soviet censure cut about 30 minutes from the movie. Parajanov was later lamenting that the work of his life is lost forever. Shortly after coming to the big screen, Parajanov suffered a lot of accusations for portraying religious and alternative thoughts throughout his movie. ""Color of Pomegranates"" was banned, and Parajanov was sent to the prison for a few years. Such was the life of one of the greatest talents in cinematography...",986860800,19,1696,4.8719723183391
723001,5,6303593720,"Sergei Paradjanov's THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES (1969) is easily among the most remarkable films produced in the former Soviet Union. Every conceivable aspect of filmmaking-mise-en-scene, color, editing, acting, music and sound effects, settings and costumes-is exploited to create a  sensuous and dense film-poem. The film's tragic vision is balanced by the  director's quirky sense of humor, which comes through in his editing  (objects playfully appear and vanish as if by magic, reminding one of  Mlis' trick films) and the childlike wonder through which the world is  depicted.
The film is not a literal biography of its subject, Sayat-Nova  (ca. 1712-1795), but an attempt to evoke the ""inner world"" of the poet and  the environment in which he lived. Sayat-Nova was born in Tbilisi, the  capital of Georgia (which has traditionally contained a sizable Armenian  population). The film evokes popularly accepted notions about his life,  adding imaginative details of its own along the way. Born Harutiun Sayadian  (""Sayat-Nova"" is a pen-name supposedly meaning ""King of Song""), he was  raised by a family of Armenian carpet weavers in Tbilisi. As a young man,  he made his mark as an ""ashugh,"" a kind of troubadour poet peculiar to the  Transcaucasus. He wrote in the three main languages of the region:  Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijani. Appointed court poet by King Irakli II,  he was eventually banished, as legend has it, for falling in love with the  Princess Anna. He then retired to the Haghpat monastery in northern Armenia  before reputedly dying during the sack of Tbilisi in 1795.
The visual  style of the film is influenced by Armenian medieval miniatures and the  19th-century Tbilisi folk painters Pirosmani (something of an artistic  saint in Georgia) and Hakob Hovnatanian (a fellow Tbilisi Armenian, like  Paradjanov and Sayat-Nova). In a drastic stylistic break with the  director's previous film, SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS (1964), the camera  rarely moves; rather, Paradjanov creates precisely composed tableaus in  which his characters stand motionless or perform ritualized pantomimes.  Paradjanov himself was a gifted artist, creating hundreds of collages and  sketches, most of which are on display at the Sergei Paradjanov Museum in  Yerevan .
Like Fellini, Paradjanov had a talent  for finding remarkable faces to populate his films. Most notable among them  is the popular Georgian actress Sophiko Chiaureli, who played several  roles, including: both the young poet and his beloved the Princess Anna,  the ""Nun in White Lace,"" and the ""Poet's Muse."" She is ravishingly  beautiful both as a male and female, mesmerizing in a wordless performance  that relies entirely on stylized gestures and facial expressions.
Although the film is renowned for its unique imagery, the soundtrack is  equally stunning. Fragments of poems and songs by Sayat-Nova are interwoven  with Armenian and Georgian traditional music and sound effects to create a  dense audio montage. Paradjanov, it should be noted, studied music before  entering film school. Also significant is the rich display of material  culture of the Transcaucasian region, including carpets and fabrics,  metalwork, and religious relics. Ancient Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani  works of architecture are used as settings, most notably the Haghpat  monastery in the second half of the film
The film and its director have  had a rocky history. Upon its release in Armenia, the film was refused  distribution in the rest of the Soviet Union until it was trimmed of  several minutes, re-edited and given new Russian intertitles. (The  videotape, fortunately, contains the original ""director's cut."") In 1973,  as part of a political campaign against intellectuals in Ukraine-where the  director had previously worked and where his wife and son still  lived-Paradjanov was arrested and charged with various crimes. Convicted of  homosexuality, he was sentenced to several years of prison in  Dnipropetrovsk, a camp of  ""severe regime."" A bootleg copy of the film was  screened at various film festivals and a campaign was launched in the West  to have him released from prison. Its supporters included film scholar  Herbert Marshall, a group of French film directors and John Updike. After  four years in prison, he was released thanks to international pressure. He  was not able to make another feature until THE LEGEND OF SURAM FORTRESS  (1984). He passed away due to lung cancer in 1990.
Kino's video transfer  is identical to the version previously released by Connoisseur Video. The  picture is ""windowboxed,"" meaning that there are black edges around all  four sides of the image to present as much of the original image as  possible, since transferring films to video usually involves cropping a bit  of the sides. The colors are somewhat faded-prints I've seen of the Russian  version have richer color, as does the Japanese videotape. This may be due  to the condition of the print used. However, it's acceptable for now and if  anything, Kino's tape looks slightly sharper than the old Connoisseur tape  due to better quality duplication.
Included on the tape is a delightful  10-minute short, ""Hakob Hovnatanian"" (circa 1967) based on the 19th century  Tbilisi-Armenian portrait painter. Paradjanov made this short while working  on POMEGRANATES. Through details in the paintings themselves as well as  costumes, architcture, etc., Paradjanov evokes the colorful atmosphere of  old Tbilisi.
To be sure, this film is not for everyone. Some will be  completely baffled, others bored. However, there is no question that  Paradjanov is a true original. Although some will prefer SHADOWS OF  FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS (1964), which has a stronger storyline and dazzling  camera movements, I feel that THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES is his masterpiece.  Along with Tarkovsky, Paradjanov was the greatest Soviet director of the  post-WWII era.",958089600,50,5922,5.367102396514161

7854392,5,6303593720,"Filmed in 1968, this thought-provoking piece of cinematic poetry retains its edge through the decades.

A biography of Armenian poet Ashug Sayat-Nova (King of Song), Sergei Parajanov's reveals Sayat-Nova's life visually through textural interpretations of he poetry rather than literally. With traditional carpets a recurring theme, it weaves together Sayat-Nova's coming of age, discovery of the female, awakening of love, admission to the monastic life, and death.

The film also presents miniatures of traditional Armenian culture.

Actress Sofiko Chiaureli plays six roles, both male and female, providing both continuity and tension.

7854395,2,6303593720,"This is a very boring piece of 'art' which does nothing to a person living in the west. Unless you are muslim or wear a scarf around your face, then you won't be at all interested in this pretentious piece of poetry from the bloated and overrated director Sergei Parajanov. It deals with some Armenian poet who wrote under the influence of opium and the film is a testament to the visions he saw. In art direction, and sets, there are passable glimpses, but so what, if it bores us out of our minds or if there is no story involved, then why do we care if we see implacably designed sets?

I had a hard time sitting through it and had to forward it because it was just too much. I think Fellini had a better mood in ""Satryican"" because he emphasized not only set design but at least some method of story telling, however disfigured. But Parajanov, who hails from the mountain regions of the Caucasus, is so accustomed to Soviet film making, which is quite vapid and slow moving, that he does nothing to engage our senses. If I were at a play, then at least I'd attempt to be polite but I must say that this is horrible. An extra on the DVD is Parajanov being interviewed in which he states that, ""a director is born"", and shows his elitist self. Then there are clips of him from annoying art festivals from europe, hailing him as the next messiah of film, its all very insipid for non-Parajanov fans.",1390435200,3,1400,4.343511450381679
7854396,2,6303593720,"For someone who knows nothing about Sayat Nova or Armenian culture, and who is not all that familiar with art in film, this is a truly bizarre piece.
It is basically montages of costumed actors doing rituals very slowly and staring directly at the camera interspersed with some poetry lines that loosely (VERY loosely) relate to what is being done on film. Needless to say, this is less about Sayat Nova and more about the director's vision. This film does not really tell a coherent story; it seems to be more of an attempt to create art for the sake of art. Having said that, it is intriguing, but at times, tedious. Once you realize that the director is playing out a highly stylized vision of poetry that may or may not have deeper symbolism, you can either just appreciate it for what it is or become slightly disappointed. I do appreciate the art, but I would have liked to see more of a story. I know that others would complain that I am being too conventional, but an hour and 18 minute film without a sense of meaning is really not that much fun to watch. If it had been shorter, it would not have been as tedious.

However, ultimately, I am impressed with the vision on some level, and the fact that this was created in 1968 makes it seem that much more impressive to me, as the only movies I have seen from this era have been conventional American films. This is definitely a departure from anything you have ever seen before, but if you want a shorter, more concise idea of what the film is about, just go to youtube and watch Juno Reactor - God is God. The video uses clips from this film, and it's basically a shorter, more succinct version just with an electronica song as a backdrop as opposed to odd music and sounds. That video is how I ended up learning about this movie and renting it!

In short, I'm not sorry to have watched it, but I'm not sure that my time was well-spent, either. I am always searching for meanings and the message behind the film, but this movie didn't seem to have a message.",1301443200,4,2018,4.36436170212766
7854397,3,6303593720,"I feel conflicted about this film, which is an exploration of the life of Armenian poet Sayat Nova.  There are some beautiful scenes here, but I felt excluded by the extremely stylized portrayal of the poet's life.  Instead of presenting a sense of his life, we get a series of set pieces that may well have profound meaning to someone who is an expert on Nova, but tells a less expert audience rather little.  One of the reviewers noted that only an Armenian could really understand the movie.  Hopefully this would also include people who deeply studied Armenia.  Even so, I think he or she has a point.  Of course, one could watch this movie purely as an exercise in formalism, but I feel that point of view is rather sterile.  A commentary track by someone who knows Nova's work would have added a great deal.  I was also frustrated by the lack of translation in many places, particularly of the prayers.  I don't know if the translation was done under the Soviets, but I can't think of any other reason not to translate prayers, which make up a lot of the dialogue.

Issues of translation are especially problematic in Paradjanov: A Requiem, which is nearly all in Russian, which I know.  There are quite a few places where the translation is simply incorrect.  For example, Paradjanov says of a film that it would be for a great German, which the subtitles give as a grown-up German.  That's like calling the founder of St. Petersburg Peter the Grownup rather than Peter the Great.  There are many gaps in the translation as well.  It seems to be a sloppy rush job.

The short feature Hagop Hovnatanian, which explores the life of a nineteenth-century Armenian artist, is my favorite of all the pieces on the DVD.  The Russian intertitles aren't translated, though.  It begins by saying ""Tiflis [now Tbilisi] of the 19th Century,"" but if you don't know Russian, I guess you're not going to get any help.  Clearly there are problems with translation throughout this DVD, which I think is the weakest of those in the box set.",1273795200,7,2029,4.633053221288516
7854398,5,6303593720,"Let me echo the comments of others: the DVD presentation of this glorious film is a shambles. The soundtrack is distorted, the subtitling is distractingly coloured and arbitrary, the print is scratchy and washed-out. The experience of watching it this way is rather like listening to a Beethoven string quartet on a crackly old transistor radio.

So why five-stars?

Because when you get past all that, you are watching a miracle. Slow, dream-like (but never surrealist), tender, at times confronting - there are very few films that can sit beside this (Syberberg's ""Parsifal"", Anger's ""Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome"", Tarkovsky's ""Nostalghia"", Cavalier's ""Therese"" come to mind).

Yes, it needs to be re-issued and given a full restoration.

Yes, it's over-priced given the quality of the presentation here.

But to refuse to buy it is to deny yourself something very precious. It's not good enough, but it's better than not seing this masterpiece at all.",1257033600,8,960,5.207792207792208
