2129526,5,B0002WZN9Y,"It is not surprising that incidents of September 11, 2001 would resonate through the Bartlett White House.  For all the intention that the show stand outside real-life political events, it is fueled by them and Sorkin's personal anger and anguish comes through in more than one episode, sparking an arc that finds the President walking down a very dark road potentially even more damaging and devestating than the revelation of his MS in season two.

To get the bad out of the way: ""The Women of Qumar"" is possibly the most heavy-handed episode of Sorkin's tenure on the series, and one that I find I cannot rewatch.  (Really.  We will change to reruns of ""Home Improvement"" at my house rather than watch this one.)  It is a moment when the show loses focus and becomes a political polemic rather than a sharply written and intelligent piece of drama that rises far above the average.

Back to the good, which far outweighs the bad.  We start with ""Manchester"" which kicks off Bartlett's re-election campaign as they struggle with the aftermath of the MS revelation.  ""Gone Quiet"" has the President and Joint Chiefs waiting to hear from a sub that may be lost in hostile waters, while  ""Indians in the Lobby"" and ""Bartlett for America"" which follow in the show's tradition of holiday episodes that are far from gooey pieces of fluff.  Lord John Marbury returns in ""Dead Irish Writers"" just as Abby pays the price for her part in the coverup (and only Donna could lose and regain her American citizenship in a single night).  The season finally culminates in the stalking of CJ and the finale ""Posse Comitatus,"" where Bartlett comes face to face with his opponent in the election for the first time.  Sorkin once gives us television that asks us to think and pay attention and sounds a call against simple complacency.

While the show I love may have outstayed its welcome on network television, we will still have this as an example of what television can be if the audience (and networks) are willing to not play it safe.",1093564800,22,2022,4.7102272727272725

2129579,5,B0002WZN9Y,"Allow me to explain.

The third season is were things pick up, the M.S scandle and relection are in full swing, energies are high, and then a major disaster occurs.

The acting, from the first season to the second to now the third season is top notch.

The third season contains three special episodes though.

Isaac and Ishmael, which remembers 9/11 and talks about Islamic extremists. The second is a documentary type episode. The third, and perhaps my favorite, talks with real past presidents and White House staff members about their experiences working in the west wing and working with presidents.

This is the third or fourth time I have watched this series and each time I watch, I learn something new about the way government is run. This may be a pipe dream but I hope our government is run this way. At least slightly this way. Gives you hope that good people will do good things. Only regret is that Sorkin made Republicans look like a bunch of fools.",1402617600,,421,4.209876543209877

2129822,5,B0002WZN9Y,"From the first lines of the Pilot, West Wing is brilliant. Aaron Sorkin's sense of humor and political astuteness unfold through the fast patter of his dialogue with such natural grace that I can watch the series again and again, discovering a new wrinkle in the jokes every time. The show predicted actual events with frightening accuracy and reflected our innermost conflicts. It is nowhere naive but always, always idealistic in the best sense of the word: it reminds us why we still cherish our ideals in the midst of our jaded, violent, manipulative, sometimes hopeless worlds. West Wing's characters are deeply sympathetic, completely human, and profoundly good though never perfect: the only kind of fictional people worthy of our love. Watch West Wing to laugh and to cry, to be educated and provoked to thought, to be inspired to believe in humanity in spite of itself. Watch West Wing to give your mind a workout and your heart some rest.",1401062400,,948,4.894409937888199

I have never watched anything on TV like this and really in general do not watch much at all. You don't have to be interested in politics to enjoy this well crafted, well written and well acted gem. Martin Sheen is at his best, but the supporting cast is awesome.
Just give a look at the Season 1 Pilot, I dare ya!

2129879,5,B0002WZN9Y,"West Wing was an excellent show when it ran on national TV. The script writing was way above par and never lost it's standards until the last half of the last season. What I find interesting is that the issues dealt with then are almost the same issues we are dealing with today. I am a conservative and don't agree with many of the positions that the scriptwriters were trying to make but never the less I thoroughly enjoy the show. The characters were developed well and we care for them as we learn their strengths and weaknesses. The scriptwriters do, by and large, try to give some of both sides of their positions and that is one reason that the show is so good. It ""went off the tracks"" in the last half of the last season because the ""message"" became more important than the characters, and then the network changed the show time to a horrible time slot. An excellent show!",1397260800,,881,4.411042944785276

2129890,5,B0002WZN9Y,Great show with the best stars.  I fell in love with the White House politics in each show.

The pilot was good, but I wasn't hooked, but then I got to season 1, episode 1 and I am obsessed.  This season is THE BEST although I have loved everything so far.  Plot lines are easy to follow, writing and acting superb, and although I wish I had had the time to watch it in 'real time' I am loving the binge watching.  I am realizing this is a great lesson on history, politics, geography, social issues, etc. all woven throughout the drama...it is no wonder they won so many accolades and so many Emmys.

2130059,3,B0002WZN9Y,"The show is fast paced and witty. It is well directed. Actor's timing is great. BUT the weakness of the story line takes in down to a three i.e. a premise is established early in the program, and the solution is arrived at the end in a rather weak manner. We spend a entire program dealing with a submarine that has not reported in. And in the final minutes all is well. The sub was being shadowed by a North Korean ship, it escaped and reported in. It took 45 minutes to set the problem and about 20 seconds to bring it to conclusion.
 It brings to mind an old radio adventure series called(I think) the Adventures of Jack Armstrong. Every Friday, the show ended with Jack in some peril, and we had to wait until Monday to find his solution. On episode ended with Jack in pit surrounded by natives who were shooting poison arrows at him. On the Monday broadcast the announcer intoned: ""when last seen Jack was in a pit surrounded by natives shooting poisoned at him. And now today's episode. When Jack got out of the pit""",1387670400,,1022,4.350785340314136

2130073,4,B0002WZN9Y,"Great view on politics here in the USA, looking back they were not frightened to hit the WH, Congress and the Senate close to home.

2130077,5,B0002WZN9Y,"One of the finest, most well written series I've ever enjoyed. The only other that tops West Wing was Mash. We so seldom see intelligently written programs like this any longer. Everything has shifted to violence and vampires and a complete lack of intelligence. It is wonderful to have a thinking person's series infused with good characterization, humor, sadness, strength and effort all in all. So well written.",1384300800,,414,5.102941176470588
2130078,5,B0002WZN9Y,Wonderful series. Very educational about the workings of the presidential office (if a bit idealistic). Each character has a strong identity which makes the whole series entertaining and thought-provoking.,1383868800,,205,6.103448275862069
2130079,5,B0002WZN9Y,One of my all time favorite TV series.  I'm so enjoying watching this via wi-fi and my Roku - no commercials - pause - advance - just like a DVD - and i don't have to get up to change discs.,1383696000,,190,3.6341463414634148

2130081,5,B0002WZN9Y,Excellent program.  Shows that issues in Washington have not changed.  Great acting timely on issues.  Republicans should be made to watch the entire series.,1383436800,,157,5.458333333333333

2130094,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I'm always wanting to watch one more episode.  Clever writing, likeable characters, and the right mix of comedy and drama make The West Wing one of the best TV dramas of all time. Numerous recurring characters and could-be-real-life story lines create the depth to keep me wanting more. It's such a good formula with an endless material that I'm surprised that Hollywood hasn't resurrected the show with a new cast and characters.",1383091200,,430,4.972222222222222
2130095,5,B0002WZN9Y,I love the West Wing. The humor is fantastic. The only season I could do without is the last one (7?) but the rest of the series is really top notch. I highly encourage anyone on the fence to buy.,1383091200,,196,3.925
2130096,5,B0002WZN9Y,It's the West Wing.  It's a show that speaks for itself. Issue from both sides.  This is how are government should operate.,1382918400,,123,4.545454545454546
2130097,5,B0002WZN9Y,I love this series!!! It's so very good. Nearly every episode is impressive to watch and while I don't know this for sure I feel that it is a descent portrayal of the government and how it works. The dialog is amazing and the chemistry between the actor/actress make the show amazing. I couldn't ask for more. Absolutely Love It!!!!,1382832000,,332,4.55
2130098,5,B0002WZN9Y,If you did not get to watch the show when it aired- then I highly recommend you watch it now.  It is funny and serious and you can get lost in the show.,1382400000,,152,3.606060606060606

2130102,5,B0002WZN9Y,"This is one of the top three seasons of the best TV series ever. Every character is noble and good yet still wrestles with his/her own insecurities. In Season 3 Bartlett has to confront the consequences of his decision not to reveal his MS to the public. There are great political risks and moral implications associated with each decision. The president is also forced to reluctantly reflect on his personally painful relationship with his father.

Many of his staff feel personally betrayed and yet deeply loyal. This creates conflict causing them (especially Toby) to deal with their own dilemmas.

I am not typically emotionally expressive but I have shed tears and laughed out loud seval times this season.

Sorkin, your work is excellent!",1381795200,,744,5.032520325203252
2130122,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I'm on my second time through watching ""The West Wing,"" and I'm enjoying it as much as the first time through. I actually bought the entire series from Amazon UK and bought a region-free DVD player to watch it on in the room where I sew. The nice thing is, Amazon has it on Prime for free (for Prime members), so I watch it on my Fire wherever I am. I rated the complete series, so you can view my review there, but I can say that every season of West Wing was good. This series has made me re-engage with politics in a healthy way. It's ironic to me that the very things that are happening at the White House and Capitol now were episodes on ""The West Wing"" back when. If you haven't watched it yet, do! I hadn't watched it when it aired originally, so this was a true find for me.",1381708800,,782,4.051612903225807

It is amazing to me that so much gets done while they are walking the halls.  Some of them never get to finish a sentence before there is an interruption.  Do they ever sleep?  When it is 2AM they are all still there and they are back at 6AM.  Hardly time for a shower!!

I love this series and how current it still is.  Everything changes and nothing changes.
The quality of the video is top shelf.  Audio is great also.",1380153600,,525,4.18

I've watched the complete series once thru, and the first 3-seasons at least 3-times additionally.  Why, because for me it worked and the bells rung each episode, which came to lead me to the later and under appreciated series, ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" also by Sorkin.",1379721600,,509,4.707865168539326

Everyone one of these actors, except possibly Sheen who was already a proven star, moved their game up to the highest notch.  And it seemed easy to see that they had a very good time doing it.

I love how smart the writing is, while retaining moments of humor.  You can't help but to care deeply for the characters.  Also, with the speed that our gov't works, it isn't surprising that many of the issues are going on or similar to issues today.

I would recommend to people who like smart and funny shows involving law or politics, like Scandal or Suits.  Watching it for free without commercials on Amazon is a huge bonus.",1377216000,,614,4.324561403508772

 The Newsroom is equally enjoying, but I miss the feeling of the meshing the characters. PLEASE SPEAK SLOWER!
 The last cast was hard to beat.",1374364800,,413,4.337662337662338

2130236,1,B0002WZN9Y,"During a ""crash"", Josh talks to some high school students who had won a trip to the White House through Presidential Classroom. Josh assures them that there is nothing to worry about. ""We've been having these crashes once a week."" Most of the security problems, it seems are due to Islamic extremists. But Josh emphasizes that the problems are not due to Muslims in general. Josh gives these high school students an SAT kind of question:
""Islamic extremist is to Islam as _______ is to Christianity.""
After hearing from the students, Josh writes down his answer: ""KKK. . . . It's the Klan gone ""medieval"" and global.

I emphasis the word medieval because it means extremely old-fashioned; primitive.

It is disturbing that the KKK is compared to Islamic extremist.  The extremist murder people, destroy property, preach hate,continuously, to perpetuate their beliefs.  They are hunted down by every government in our known world and killed or imprisoned.
However, the KKK, cross burning, people murdering, hate preaching, property destroying organization is free to roam around and do whatever they please because its modern???!!  Yet, today it continues...

Okay here is a test, fill in the blanks.

The reason the Islamic extremist exist is because________.  The reason the KKK exist is because___________.

I see ideas killed all the time, but the only ones that continue for centuries are the ones that have financial backing and are being taught.

2130266,5,B0002WZN9Y,The third season seems to have a much better coordination between the spoken dialogue and background music.

No matter how many times I revisit this series it moves me all over again.  Smart, intelligent, educated writing that never fails to thrill me, leaving me wanting more.  I can never watch just one episode at a time.  This is writing that isn't afraid to make it's viewers pay attention and LEARN something.  I often thought this current White House should employ Mr. Sorkin to write speeches for them.

2130468,4,B0002WZN9Y,"I've been watching the series streamed on my Amazon Prime.  Having never seen the show prior to this stretch, and really not following the critical acclaim for the show, I'd really never felt inspired to tackle the series until after watching and enjoying ""The Newsroom"" by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin.

I'm sure that the one or two of you that happen to stumble on my review, and have bothered to continue to read it, are probably more familiar with the show than I was, and regardless of what I have to say, have or will watch it regardless.  All I can say is that it is a real kudos to NBC that they let the show be produced with such a magnificent standard of intelligence that one has to either be sharp as a tack to follow it live, or else they rewatch a recorded copy.  Nonetheless, it moves fast in it's dialog and presumes that folks will keep up.

I'm currently now into Season 4.  I have no idea what's to come (other than I'd heard in advance about changes in the Presidents staff due to health and contractual issues with certain actors) but I'm thoroughly engaged in the action.  I'd also heard that Season 4 was the last for Mr. Sorkin; if the series noticeably suffers as a result, I may drop out of the series.

For now, I will say that the acting and writing is absolutely terrific, the flow of the action works well, and (perhaps the greatest compliment) that the show's various stories not only arc from episodes and moments within the season, but even moments from earlier seasons.  Which means that, to follow certain story lines, you really need to watch the whole series.  I so admire that in a series.  It works on it's own terms, and expects it's audience to comply.

For all of my heaps of praise, I will add that it's not perfect (thus 4 stars).  While NBC does deserve it's kudos, it remains a very idealized version of American politics.  So far anyway, it tackles some complexities but avoids others, such as the influence of money in politics and various matters of corruption.

Also, President Bartlett and his staff seem like an immensely likeable and extraordinarily intelligent bunch, fast thinking and amazingly clever, it's a bit irritating that there's hardly any noticeable deviation from this characterization.  I know this is Sorkin (I see it on ""The Newsroom"" as well) but it still makes the show feel like a show... contrived.  I start with shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Breaking Bad"" as the 5-star bar, where the characters are much more complex and fully realized.  On West Wing, the characters are simply less believable as real people.

So, to sum up, after 3-1/2 seasons, I'm really impressed with the groundbreaking standard of quality for West Wing as a network TV series, but for all of it's admirable qualities, it's not as great as some of the non-network TV shows I've seen.",1360713600,,2833,4.607569721115538
2130479,5,B0002WZN9Y,"IMHO ""The West Wing"" was one of the best shows ever, and it still holds up 10 years later, although it is a bit depressing to realize we are still struggling with many of the same issues.  I love that writer Aaron Sorkin assumes the audience is smart enough to keep up ( as he did in ""Sports Night""), and the truly incredible cast brings those beautiful words to life in stellar performances.

President in this series, they were done very well and
you laugh with their way of coping with some very real
and important decisions. It gives you a view into what
goes on inside of the White House and you find out
quickly that you want not only a capable person for this
office, but a compassionate one, as well. I would

I was disapointed with my purchase. The sound quality of this video stream from amazon instant was terrible. The video quality isn't anywhere close to as good as HD television programming. I wish I could find this show on blu-ray, but I wouldn't waste your money on this download. It is very convenient to have these downloaded episodes available in a list in your TV menu through the Amazon Instant app, but the quality was no where near what I would expect for over a dollar per episode.",1316044800,,673,4.524590163934426
2130550,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I started watching The West Wing at the start of Season 3.  The ""Issac and Ishmael"" episode, especially how quickly it was produced under the circumstances, was a magical piece of television.  The story of Bartlet's reelection stretches into S4, which is also a fine season, but the beginning of the campaign, tied into the investigation of the MS coverup, makes for some great political drama.  The comedy element of the show is there as well, and that just adds to the overall enjoyment of the series.

As a self proclaimed walking West Wing encyclopedia, I would hands down say this is the best season of one of the best shows of all time.  The final stretch of eps with the CJ being stalked story line, is also very very well done.  ""Posse Comitatus"" is one of my favorite all time episodes.  The Jeff Buckley ""Hallelujah"" over the Mark Harmon scene, followed by Barlet at The Wars of the Roses while the CIA hit is going down...just really, really good story telling and amazing cinematography.

If you like any of The West Wing...buy this season DVD!!",1311984000,,1057,4.645161290322581

It's very annoying to purchase the episode and find key parts missing.  The entire show is just over 30 minutes.  Why would they cut 10 minutes out?

The entire entry of Toby and Sam into the room speaking with the high school children was omitted, shortening the run-time to only 32 minutes. I do not know how or why this happened, as it was my first time purchasing an episode from Amazon. As a fan of the show, I must give no less than three stars for this episode, but must also voice my displeasure at being robbed of a full episode.",1300492800,8,577,4.302752293577981

2130555,4,B0002WZN9Y,"`The West Wing: Season Three' offers up the third instalment of this superb American political drama. This time the series focuses on the fallout from the Presidents MS scandal, as well as his re-election campaign. You get the typical snappy dialogue we have become accustomed to, as well the individual political storylines that tie each episode up, as well as the over-arcing storylines that tie the entire series together. This series also explores some of the back story to the Bartlett administration and why and how he ran for President the first time round and gives a deeper insight into the various characters personalities and relationships. As we have come to expect, the audience is treated with respect throughout and are allowed to work things out for ourselves, whilst having the finer points explained without patronising us. This maintains the high standards it has set for itself in the first two series and makes for just as engrossing and enthralling viewing. Well worth watching if you enjoyed the first two series.

Aaron Sorkin is an intellectually witty writer who uses his craft well, building a composition of dialogue and coordinating it all the time with the temperment and talent of a very gifted cast. I have always found West Wing a welcome retreat from normal television. Given our current schedule overrun with ridiculous brainless and unentertaining Reality-TV shows, it's nice to take these fictionally informative alternate reality trips to the White House. It feels like you are walking along side informed people, no matter their political party. Smart TV is hard to find.

The mere fact of its political setting will polarize some viewers, etc., but taken as a whole (or as 4 seasons worth) theres has been little out there to equal its intelligence and idealism, excellence of writing and acting, episode after episode. This is television.. remember that. This is the same medium that would equate a laugh track with humor, and that increasingly markets the wares of the national drug-dealers during commercial breaks (side effects may include nausea, vomitting, headache, flatulence, loss of bladder control, and mental uncertainty and mistrust of nature.)  As television, then, the West Wing is a oasis. It may not be perfect (the characters all have a too similar 'smart & snappy' way of talking.. even the pizza delivery guy) but taken as whole it is a landmark.

your pennies.

Laying all that aside, I'm happy to say I'm overjoyed to find
the four episode arc Mark Harmon appeared in during Season Three

It is also not ""dumbed down"" so they deal with a lot of hot-button topics and you can actually learn a little of how the government actually works and how cutthroat life is like in Washington, D.C.

The first few seasons and the last two seasons are the best. There are a good deal of special features and this season was amazing.

I have all of the seasons. I received them all from Amazon (most were Christmas gifts).

4 of the sets had defective disks. There would be at least one episode that you could not play without it skipping. Please make sure you watch the episodes completely within the 30 return period to be sure that there are no defective disks. Amazon is very good about replacing the set if there are defects but there is a time limit. It is hard to get through 20+ hours of tv watching in 30 days!

Also- Sets 1-3 (and maybe 4) have programming on both sides of the disks. Seasons 1 & 2 are my favorites and have been watched many times. Over time the disks seem to ""split"" in the center and skipping occurs now throughout the programming. There are no scratches on the disks and the skipping is inconsistant (always happens on the disks now, but not always in the same place).

This issue does not seem to occur with the later sets (programming only on one side). There is no way to replace the disks once this starts happening.

2130602,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I admit that the Season 3 is where I lost track of the show. The debut episode, 'Manchester', marked a change in tone for the entire series. It's obvious that 9/11 changed the West Wing in a fundamental way. There's considerably less incidental music from ""Snuffy"" Walden. The attitude of the characters is far grimmer. More attention is placed on Middle Eastern politics and terrorism, and less to domestic political problems.

We're also introducted to the much vilified Amy Gardner, played by Mary Louise-Parker. As I was heavily influenced by fan reaction rather than actually watching the show, I hated this character. But now that I've actually watched the show, I really like Amy. She's a perfect match for Josh, and her relationship with him is realistic and just downright charming. Which reminds me, I've gotta catch Mary Louise-Parker in Weeds.

Another character that I think gets plenty of attention this season is Donna. She no longer has the outwardly ditzy persona of seasons 1 and 2. Instead, she gets to handle a scandalous relationship with a Republican lawyer. And she gets a lucrative job offer. She becomes more aware of her own self-worth this season, and it's wonderful to see Donna maturing and growing before our very eyes.

The only genuine clanger this season is President Bartlet's ""psychological problems"" that are explored in 'The Two Bartlets' and 'Night Five'. What's odd is that the President has never exhibited any of these symptoms before .

In summary, this season marks a huge sea-change for The West Wing. Gone is the bright, cheery optimism of the first two seasons. The events of 9/11 put an end to that. But this is still The West Wing. And these are still the characters we know and love, written by one of America's greatest playwrights.

Now, as a GOP and Bush - voter, I do not exactly agree with everything presented, and it doesn't mean that I am happy with the real president either. President Josiah Bartlet, really, is too good to be true. Everything he does ends up to be for the better of the country.

2130639,4,B0002WZN9Y,"The third season of the West Wing falters a little relative to the second and fourth seasons, but the worst West Wing episode is still better than most other TV shows.  This season consists of 21 episodes in continuity, plus 2 ""bonus"" shows.  The season opener (Isaac and Ishmael) is one of the bonus shows and is also one of the highlights of the series.  It deals with the aftermath of September 11 (airing only a month after the fact) outside continuity of the show, but with everyone in character.  The second special show is a documentary on the way government is run - it may be self-congratulatory, but it also assures the viewer that they are seeing a ""truthful"" representation of life in the West Wing.  Also reassuring is the presence of 3 former presidents (Ford, Carter, and Clinton) in the special as well as numerous presidential aides (including notable Republicans Henry Kissinger and Karl Rove): even if you don't agree with the politics of the liberal/Democratic president of the show, thoughtful members of both parties like the show because it shows the president always trying to do what he feels is right.  And that's what you need your elected leaders doing!

In between these two specials are the real, in continuity episodes.  They are a mixed batch, in terms of how interesting they are, but generally improve as the weeks go on.  The president accepts a congressional censure for hiding his medical condition after much angst and testimony from his staff.  The re-election campaign kicks off and Gov. Ritchie appears as the Republican nominee.  Meanwhile legislation is passed, the president vetoes a bill, and the cliffhanger ending sends reverberations through all of Season 4 and into Season 5.  There is one unfortunate addition to the semi-regular cast - the feminist Amy Gardner who is as annoying as the late unlamented Mandy from season 1.  For the most part, though, the supporting roles are great: the election spin-doctor Bruno, Leo's lawyer Jordan, Mark Harmon's secret service agent, and the first appearance of Adm. Fitzwallace (chair of the Joint Chiefs).

However, outside of the ""23rd"" (documentary) episode, the extras on this DVD are mainly disappointing.  Not in quality (they are short, but enjoyable), but in quantity.  There are only 3 commentaries (as oppposed to The Simpsons or Futurama, for example, which have commentaries on every episode).  Finally, I will voice once again my main objection to the extras - why aren't there political scientists and/or politicians on commentaries explaining the actual governmental workings?  For example, on the episode where Bartlet vetoes the bill (Ways and Means), or one with the senate hearings (Bartlet for America), or how the primary system works (Hartsfield's Landing).",1124668800,6,2770,5.077262693156733

2130642,5,B0002WZN9Y,"Premiering in September 1999, the original NBC series West Wing built an instant cult following with its seemingly realistic weekly excursions into the inner sanctums of the White House. The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...

Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...

The West Wing (Season 3) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Manchester: Part 1"" in which C.J. mistakenly reveals during her press conference that President Bartlet suffers from a medical condition, prompting an onslaught of media attention regarding the president's health. In gearing up to spin the revelation, the staffers discuss whether or not Bartlet should apologize to the nation for failing to reveal the problem. Meanwhile, Abbey is not pleased when she learns that Jed has decided to run for re-election... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Indians in the Lobby"" in which a pair of Indians announce their plans to stand in the lobby of the Department of Interior until they receive an answer on their 15-year-old application to buy back lost Indian lands, and ""Hartsfield's Landing"" in which the staffers begin to execute their presidential primary strategy (beginning in New Hampshire) in their plan to win Bartlet's re-election...

2130643,5,B0002WZN9Y,"Has any other television show won the Emmy in each of its first four seasons?  The West Wing transcends television, and it transcends politics too.

One of the reasons my wife and I love it (and we're both life-long Republicans) is it shows realistic people with realistic intelligence and strong compassion and convictions running the United States.  Don't we hope WHOEVER is in the White House (party politics aside) runs the country with equivalent brains and heart and courage? (Good grief, I sound like I'm reviewing ""The Wizard of Oz"".)

Season three has as many high points and as few low ones as the first two seasons.  Major additional characters include Tom Harmon as a Secret Service Special Agent assigned to C.J. after she begins getting death threats and Mary-Louise Parker as a high profile feminists who pushes her agenda while romancing Josh.

Sentimental touches abound, such as when Leo and the President reminisce about the very beginning of the ""Bartlet for America"" campaign, and the episode where Abbey is given a White House Birthday and winds up getting drunk with C.J., Donna and Amy.

These are characters that you come to care about, and it is thrilling watching them run the country.

After watching about the first disk of the series, I was hooked and it had become my favorite show.  The first season just blew my mind.

This is anything but watching an hour of Capital Hill voting on CNN, though.  There's an incredible cast including Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney, Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe who take you into the show and the world of politics.

2130647,4,B0002WZN9Y,"The West Wing is certainly one of the best television dramas of all time. The Season One boxed set was 20 hours of pure entertainment. The season was well written, fast-paced, and the plotlines tightly coupled. The season ended with a shocking climax that left viewers panting for Season Two. They weren't disappointed.

Season Two didn't skip a beat in maintaining the speed, energy, or suspense viewers had come to expect. The Season Two finalie was also a cliffhanger, albeit one to which the outcome was certain.

When Season Three begins, the energy, suspense, and well-written plotlines are all but forgotten. The entire season meanders slowly through an election year campaign season with side trips to an attorney or two over the President and First Lady's 's legal troubles.

The introduction of a new character, a strong, assertive, self-assured campaign manager, breathes some life into the few episodes he appears in and Oliver Platt delivers consistently good performances as the White House legal counsel.

However, there a numerous episodes with little meaning to the overall plot, and development of the storyline progresses little during the season. The season winds down with a fairly depressing, but not-at-all suspenseful finalie in which the President expresses his determination to win re-election, the exact same crux that he faced at the end of the second season.

Overall, The West Wing Season Three manages to squeeze in 20 more episodes without any relevant advancement of the plot, characters, or relationships in the Bartlett administration. Viewers could easily skip Season Three and pick up at Season Four and would miss little of importance.",1103500800,3,1673,5.250936329588015
2130648,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I really love this program, and this season in particular.  Its a refreshing break from the mind-numbing content and style of most American television; and in a time when extremists are running the real-life White House, its nice to be reminded what it could look like to have a moderate and open-minded administration -even if it is fictional.  As a moderate conservative myself, I think 'The West Wing' provides much needed relief for people on both the left and the right of America's political spectrum.
Every part of this show is constructed beautifully.  Aaron Sorkin and the other writers never flinch from confronting major issues, and those which they do confront are examined in a manner which never condescends to the viewers.  They treat us as intelligent, informed people, and for that I am grateful.  The acting is top-notch, particularly in the character of C.J. Craig played by Allison Janney; and the sets are immaculate; So that, all in all, 'The West Wing' creates a world that is always believable, always entertaining, and -rare for TV- always intellectually stimulating.
If 'The West Wing' has one weakness, it is that the directors can sometimes slip into sentimentality.  However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise spectacular show and is easily overlooked, and in Season Three this problem is alot softer than in the previous two.",1101772800,4,1358,5.013333333333334

2130660,4,B0002WZN9Y,"4.5 stars.  The main reason I love this show is the writing; the excellent character acting and cinematography coming in second and third, respectively.  The dialogue is thoughtfully written and remains fresh, for the most part, even after more than sixty episodes.  The third season picks up appropriately where the last episode from season two left off but the plot is then put on hold for one full show due to the events of September 11th.  The very first episode, which stands entirely alone, has more to do with explaining why those types of events occur in the first place, what belief systems are driving the extremists, and why, in short, do they hate America so much.  It was yet another enlightening episode, like many others from the previous two seasons, and is a somber tone to begin season three.  But most of the episodes that follow are actually upbeat and subsequently less passionate than season two.  I absolutely adored season two, and I knew going in to season three that high expectations were both in order and obviously unfair.  The writing is still superb.  The entire cast, with many, many guest actors entering and infusing their immense talents into the show, all look and feel more comfortable in their roles than ever before.  There are many moments of brilliance here, my personal favorite coming late in the season (episode #17 ""The U.S. Poet Laureate"") where the show is elevated to greatness throughout with every single nuance and word so carefully and emotionally revealed that something magical happens.  That entire episode is stellar.  This brings me to the only downfall to the season, which is that ""The U.S. Poet Laureate"" is the only show that never becomes predictable or stagnant or has a rare flat spot.  There are many great moments throughout each and every show, but unlike season two which had a multitude of outstanding whole episodes, season three only had one amazing episode and many other good ones.  To reiterate: the writing is the main reason to watch this show, regardless of untied sub-plots and too many unresolved characters exiting, not to be seen for five or six shows at a time.  The stories are at their most fresh in season three when flashback episodes unfold, where the actors give their characters more vitality and youthfulness instead of the weary characters of the West Wing stumbling into a re-election year.  Overall, this is yet another solid season of one of the most impressive shows ever brought to television.  Those who criticize ""The West Wing"" too much should look and see and remind themselves of all the heaping crud that comprises most network television, and thank their lucky stars that a show this professional and sometimes incredible was ever made.  Thank you Aaron Sorkin, and the entire cast and production staff of ""The West Wing.""  Keep up the phenomenal work.",1100736000,4,2855,4.898128898128898
2130661,5,B0002WZN9Y,"Here in the UK and all that we had from across the pond was Friends or Will & Grace (plus others, I liked Smallville for instance) the prospect of anything cerebral as a TV show was beginning to fade. Along came ""24"", good action etc... but what about something for the more politically attuned person. The answer, the superb West Wing.

In this 3rd season the characters have developed very nicely, Toby even smiles ! The political meandering & shenanigans make the House of Commons look like first school. What I find missing are historical references such as Bartlett has his MS but then why no mention of Roosevelt's polio, Kennedy's back injury and the drugs he took for it, Reagan's Alzheimer's ? Perhaps out of respect. What about the shady dealings of numerous presidents regarding arms dealing in the world etc.. A lot of this is absolute fact but Bartlett seems too good to be true, a few skeletons in the closet but nothing too shocking (not shocking probably due to my constant exposure to the UK tabloids and their stories).

In summary, very entertaining and best of the bunch. For political drama, the best of any long running series. Lets hope that the quality continues.",1100649600,7,1187,4.729468599033816
2130662,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I began watching the West Wing regularly only in Season Three.  I had seen the end of Season Two, granted, but only so far as I witnessed a President's betrayal.  In Season Three, I saw a President as an abstract representation of morality,  who confronts his inclinations and then rises beyond his failings and feelings.

This president lied to win his office.  Had he at any time admitted  his condition, John Hoynes-TX (Tim Matheson) would have won the presidency.  And yet this presidency shows us that a leader can conceal fact for the right reasons; we, as a  populous, can be misinformed and uninformed for our own good.  The actions of current administration show us that misinformation and disinformation damage each American and America as a nation.  In contrast, Josiah Bartlet demonstrates that governance is determined by the way one *answers* as crisis, not the way one *creates* a crisis.

To the disenfranchised of America, know that Josiah Barlett is a distillation of the best qualities of our current leaders.  Our congressmen, our governors, our teachers, our mothers can rise to these standards. Maintain faith and work hard.

I recommend Season Four to every Presidential hopeful.  There we witness a President answer for a war waged for reasons other than those given to the American people.

Stop watching the West Wing after Season Four.  As executive producer, John Wells has sold the show's moral integrity and unique production for unprincipled politics and dumbed-down positions.

Please enjoy this program to Season Four, and then give it an honorable demise.",1100217600,6,1589,5.096899224806202

2130664,4,B0002WZN9Y,"The third season of ""The West Wing"" actually gets off on the wrong note as far as I am concerned for the simple reason that if they President of the United States shows up for a monumentally important press conference half-wet and looking wild eyes, the country is going to think he has gone off the deep end.  Having MS would be the least of Jed Bartlet's problems at that point, but we are supposed to let the high drama of the moment be such that none of the members of the rabid White House press corps notice his dishevelment.

The MS plot line ends up being problematic during the Third Season.  The idea is certainly interesting, especially in light of revelations and Kennedy's Addison's Disease and Reagan's Alzheimer that have raised questions as to what medical conditions would affect a president's competency.  But the story arc devolves into more of a general sense of getting anybody in the Bartlet Administration, where Charlie is going to get saddled with $100,000 in legal fees if he has done nothing wrong (""Manchester""), Donna commits perjury because she tries to protect her personal diary (""War Crimes""), and Leo's alcoholism becomes the cherry on the Republican's sundae (""Bartlet for America"").  In the end, Leo's problems become what ends the issue, with Bartlet's neglecting to tell anybody he had MS becoming a footnote (""H. Con-172"").

In retrospect what might have been missing from this season was a Democratic challenger to Bartlet's nomination, simply because there are so many episodes dealing with meaningless primaries (e.g., ""Night Five,"" ""Hartsfield's Landing"") and a face is not put on Republican nominee Governor Ritchie of Florida until the final episode (""Posse Comitatus""), although Bartlet does put a shot across his bow (""The U.S. Poet Laureate"").  This is underscored by what ""The West Wing"" is doing its current season, bringing in Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits as eager beavers all ready making their moves on the White House.

What ends up being the major plot line that extends beyond the third season is the problem of Qumar and its defense minister Abdul Shareef with his terrorist ties.  Qumar was in the background the entire season, with the Administration trying to get an airbase lease with a nation that perpetuates atrocities against its women (""The Women of Qumar"") and other problems, but when Bartlet gives the order to have Shareef assassinated in the big finale he sets in motion a chain of events that will result in Zoe being kidnapped and Bartlet handing over the presidency to the Republican Speaker of the House at the end of Season Four.  If there is one strength of the show in recent seasons it has been in dealing with the problems of the Middle East.  Whether this was because of, or despite, the attacks on September 11th is too hard to tell.  The special episode, ""Isaac and Ishmael,"" which ran before the first episode and after September 11th was notable because it touched on a wide spectrum of issues while sounding the necessary note of caution regarding leaping to the assumption that all Arab-Americans are terrorists.  I think it is also clear that the show's harder edge in terms of realpolitik stems from what happened in the real world right before the third season started.

Favorite Moments from ""The West Wing: The Complete Third Season"": The President calling the Butterball Hot Line and C.J. dealing with ""The Indians in the Lobby.""  C.J. raising hell with Nancy McNally over ""The Women of Qumar.""  Sam contemplating the paragraph that was cut from the State of the Union Address in which they cured Cancer in ""100,000 Airplanes.""  Charlie winning the war of practical jokes with C.J. in ""Hartsfield's Landing.""  Donna, the temporary Canadian, forgetting that Abbey turned back into Mrs. Bartlet in ""Dead Irish Writers,"" and being told by the President that he cannot do a proclamation to honor her favorite teacher who is retiring in ""Stirred.""  Ron Butterfield getting C.J. to take the death threats she is receiving seriously in ""Enemies Foreign and Domestic.""  We lose Ainsley Hayes, but we do have Amy Gardner and Simon Donovan in recurring roles, and a touch of Debbie Fiderer to go along with my favorite, Admiral Fitzwallace.

After the big start and shocking finish to the Second Season, which was arguably the best season of ""The West Wing,"" it is not surprising that the Third Season is something of a letdown, especially when you compare the first and final episodes from those two seasons (I think ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen"" was the best ""West Wing"" episode ever).  But the thing I remember thinking (and saying) most often during that season was that while everybody was worried about the president's re-election bid as soon as Jed Bartlet gets on stage with an opponent in a nationally televised debate, it is not just ""Game On,"" but game over.  If you have seen Season Four, then you know I was right.",1099353600,14,4907,4.885542168674699
2130665,5,B0002WZN9Y,"'Evolution' is a process of change & West Wing has certainly changed during its 5 Seasons.

By Season 3 the characters are familiar & many issues expected to be featured in a drama like this have been explored.

But evolution also implies improvement & this is the debating point for fans of the show.

As the Seasons have progressed, some of the Bartlett Administration's idealism has given way to self-preservation & a certain cynicism has crept in - rather like a real political administration. Maybe the cynicism has rubbed off on the show's audience.

Most of us in the UK don't have the advantage (or impediment?) of seeing the drama in the context of the real-life political structure it portrays & are left to view it as just that - drama. Political idealism is almost anathema to us Brits so its fading in the West Wing makes the show more real.

Alternatively, whilst we were affected & appalled by 9/11, the effect on us could not have been as profound as on US viewers of the show whose course in Season 3 must have been severely jolted.

The consensus seems to be that West Wing went down hill somewhere between the start of Season 3 and 'Inauguration Day' in Season 4. And yet I still find good things in Season 5 - Josh's testing was well handled & his relationship with Donna was as nicely understated as ever. There's even a bit of humour creeping back in (the new VP & Pearce character) & CJ's periodic disillusionment is a well-played undercurrent.

I'm re-watching Season 3 (in tandem with Season 5) & enjoying it even more second time around.

Perhaps by the latter, the show isn't quite 'punching its weight by its own high standards, but stagnation, abolutely pathetic, outstayed its welcome - really?

The West Wing surprised me from the outset - I didn't think a drama of this quality could come out of the US & rival the best of British. But it has ... and more. It'll always be in my top ten TV serials. Even the much maligned Season 5 is amongst the best TV currently on view.

So, ladies and gentlemen, some perspective please.",1098921600,21,2056,4.5625
2130666,5,B0002WZN9Y,"The third season of The West Wing follows President Bartlett and his staff as they kick off his re-election campaign.  This comes in the wake of President Bartlett's admission to the public that he has M.S. and concealed it from the public during the campaign.

The season actually starts off with an episode entitled ""Isaac and Ishmael,"" a stand alone episode written in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Many people did not like the episode (although it has gained popularity) but I really enjoyed it.  After that, the season resumes where it left off in ""Two Cathedrals"" (the second season finale).  Ron Silver comes on as Bruno Gianelli, the campaign director for Bartlett's re-election.  There are some spectacular guest appearances throughout this season (besides Silver).  First is Mark Harmon, as a Secret Service Agent who is assigned to protect CJ Cregg after she receives several death threats.  Also, Hal Holbrooke is great as Assistant Secretary of State Ablie Duncan.

Bartlett's opponent in the presidential race is Republican Governor Richie, a man with a President George W. Bush-type persona.  Besides having to overcome his lie about his medical condition, Bartlett must compete with a candidate who seems to be more like the ""average American"" and he must decide whether to try and take that path, or stick with being himself, an academic liberal from New England.

All in all this is a great season, although perhaps not as consistent as the first two.  The last episdoe, ""Posse Commitatus,"" is a great finale in which the President must decide whether or not to use military foces to assisinate a foreign leader.  West Wing fans should own this season as it continues on the tradition of superb writing, wit, and drama.",1098316800,68,1751,4.996551724137931
2130667,3,B0002WZN9Y,"It may have been the year that netted a dozen or so Emmy's (there was certainly no competition amongst the mediocre nominees), but this was the year that smelled like stagnation for the series.  There's a handful of strong episodes - great emotional ones like ""Bartlet for America,"" about Leo's alcoholic breakdown, or ""Dead Irish Writers,"" the funny and touching episode dealing with Abbey's fallout over the abuse of her medical license.  But for the most part, the ideas have gone stale - the impeachment plotline goes nowhere interesting, which is perhaps why it gets jettisoned midway through the year, and the season-ending culmination of CJ's bodyguard plotline with Mark Harmon is just embarrassing.  Aaron Sorkin seemed to be losing grip of his characters this year, especially his women who get plotlines that are either dull (CJ gets heated over land taken from the Indians!) or really dull (Donna needs to get out of jury duty - or, as I viewed it, time for a bathroom break).  In fact, the only woman he really gets right is the new one, Mary Louise Parker's feminist Amy that gives the season it's most memorable moments of heart and humor (""and I have legs that go all the way to the floor!"").  The West Wing even in its greatest episodes jutted up against a line of self-righteousness, and although this season doesn't spend the whole year jumping over that line, it spends far too much of it for comfort.  And for anyone taking votes on the jump-the-shark moment of the series, I'd pick ""Hartsfield's Landing,"" which overloads with Sorkin quirkiness - too much useless trivia, too many trivial sideplots, and a weak central metaphor about the president playing chess with everyone.

2130668,5,B0002WZN9Y,West Wing is the best written network television show out there.  There is no denying how well this show is put together and how amazing the production value is.  This is a season full of surprises and moments of sheer brilliance.  Allison Janney shows why she gets all the statues. Janel Moloney also shines through a sea of bright stars.  Just an absolutely amazing show.,1097539200,24,373,4.6923076923076925
2130679,5,B0002WZN9Y,"The West Wing's third season began in sadness. The 9/11 attacks would change much about our country (and this show), and we got an episode after them (Isaac and Ishmael) that attempted to show sensitivity and comfort during a confusing time. At that time, it wasn't generally liked, but it seems to have aged well (it was voted the 10th best episode by Bravo viewers earlier this year). After this, though, the season began in earnest, picking up where the astonishingly good ""Two Cathedrals"" episode left off and begins a multi-episodic story arc that has the staff at odds with each other as well as the introduction of the fabulous Ron Silver as Bruno Gianelli (he would get an Oscar nod for his performance). Truth be told, this season didn't have the same uniformity of excellence that previous ones did--the middle of the season was lukewarm, with episodes like ""The Two Bartlets"" and ""Night Five"" which rank among the lowest in the series (let's keep it in perspective, though: the worst of this season is still better than the best of the current one). However, the show pulls off one of the best episodes of the show in the finale, ""Posse Comitatus"", which has President Bartlet grappling with faith, law and morality in the matter of having an Osama bin Ladin-like terrorist assassinated. The sheer shock of the final act still brings chills down my spine every time I see it. Also notable: perhaps the most emotional episode in the series, ""Bartlet for America"" won an Emmy and its final scene between the President and Leo rivals the denouement in Kubrick's Paths of Glory for full-force emotional impact. ""Gone Quiet"" is a gripping story about a lost submarine, and features a wonderful, curmedgeonly performance by Hal Holbrook as Assistant Secretary of State Albie Duncan. ""100,000 Airplanes"" is an example of the complex narrative structure of the series: there are no less than four major stories revolving around Bartlet's State of the Union address, each of which are engaging. One of my favorites is ""The U.S. Poet Laureate,"" which covers the scandal following an off-air gaffe on the part of the president. Says C.J. Cregg, ""It's a classic Washington scandal. We got in trouble for telling the truth."" But all through this season are these character threads: the President and Abbey (leading to a surprisingly touching scene in ""Dead Irish Writers""), Josh and Amy's budding relationship, Toby and his ex-wife, Andie, and, of course, the President and Leo. The final one was always one of the most satisfying relationships with the show, and the fact that the current WW writers have all but eliminated it is one of my major beefs with the show right now. Enough soapboxing. Season 3 of the West Wing contains powerful drama and excitement, examination of real political issues and real people. It's definitely worth the money for anyone.",1096675200,135,2858,4.919254658385094
2130680,5,B0002WZN9Y,"I understand everyone is heartbroken over Sorkin leaving the show. I might say to those oh so ""loyal"" fans--get a hold of yourself. This Season 3 is not the beginning of the end, and neither is Season 4. Season 5 tapers off, but still--if you were line up the DVD's of dramas over the last 20 years, this Season would still easily be in the top 10 of any given season of any drama.

Compared to everything else on television, the Season is amazing. Sorkin moves beyond the self-contained walls of his fantasy world and into a world a bit more gritty. We see this movement long before Season 3--it shows its face from time to time in the first season, but really comes to a head during the last few episodes of Season 2. With an unlimited budget, Sorkin wants to explore new things, which takes them beyond the walls of the one building. And everyone needs to realize--by the time he starts writing Season 3, he has already written or helped to write 44 hours with the same core of characters. Its just like in real life--after a while, you just get more personal. The issues are still there, as is the drama and acting. Bartlett for America is every bit, if not more moving, than Let Bartlet be Bartlet from Season 2, and the idealism reigns supreme in all the character's at-heart intentions.

Bottom line--I would give 5 stars to this Season in a heartbeat. Superb acting and directing from an intelligent, if not sometimes over-pressured writer. Helps create an amazing collection of episodes.

2130681,4,B0002WZN9Y,"THE WEST WING didn't ""jump the shark"" and become crappy until John Goodman became President at the end of Season Four, but with the start of Season Three, TWW has reached the point where it is no longer great. (For its first two seasons it was the best show on television.) But it is still very good!

In the aftermath of 9-11, real life events overtook and overshadowed even the fictional world of Pres Bartlet's White House. Aaron Sorkin addresses the 9-11 attacks with a special episode that, for all its flaws, highlighted the immediacy with which TWW could comment on a pressing issue.

But when the series returned to its continuing story of the POTUS's health crisis and the ensuing investigation, TWW felt disconnected. It wasn't just a fictional world. It sometimes seemed like an absurdly fictional world.

Nonetheless, I give Aaron Sorkin all the credit in the world for his efforts. The show is still the best written series on TV. And the third season contains some terrific individual episodes.

2130682,4,B0002WZN9Y,"Since being introduced to West Wing last Christmas (Series One as a present) I have avidly consumed every subsequent episode available on DVD. It is TV writing at its absolute best. I have just finished Series 3 but I have to say with some disappointment principally because of the last episode.

West Wing is so good because it is believable. Start producing predictable or unbelievable storylines then, I believe, you are on a slippery slope.

WARNING SPOILER

The last episode consisted of three sub-plots.

1 The assassination - superbly handled with the moral dilemma facing the President balanced with the increasing tension as the time approached. Rivetting stuff.

2 The bodyguard romance - I  knew that there was likely to be more than one armed robber in the shop so why didn't one of the best trained agents in the world! And surely anybody protecting a member of the president's staff would wear body armour. Too predictable, I was waiting for him to be shot and conveniently removed from the series.

3 The replacement secretary for Bartlett - This was just plain stupid. Firstly we are expected to believe that the replacement task would be allocated to Charlie. Secondly that Charlie would browbeat somebody who didn't want to apply into applying. Thirdly, and totally unbelievably, that having turned up stoned for an interview with the Preident she would be given a second chance because she was the person that gave Charlie a job. Come on! Just give the job to Donna.

I agree that season two is one of the best, however take caution to judge each season on its own merits.  At the risk of delving me into the high school nightmare of my youth, think of it this way.  The first is the frosh idealistic, novelty stage; the second is the sophomore ""We've-got-to-prove-we're-worth-all the-Emmys"" stage and the junior third is the digging in and beginning the long haul.  The episodes are less culminated by the final credits and more focused on long-term story building.  I think the characters in season three begin to lose their overall humanity we enjoyed in seasons one and two for a more elitist, focus on their positions of power.  In short, in season three, the show grows up.  It loses its initial charm for an aura of smart.  The West Wing is still deserving of its accolades, still worth an hour of my life.

2130684,5,B0002WZN9Y,"Although the special episode ""Isaac and Ishmael"" is not part of the regular season three, I have read that it will be included on this DVD set. I was unable to find out anything about the features or whether another midseason show, a documentary special, would be included.  Maybe this season is not quite as good as the first two, but it still beats most of what is on TV. Here is a brief recap of the episodes.

2130685,4,B0002WZN9Y,"While I agree with many of the other reviews listed here, I must respectfully disagree with the contention that this is the last ""great"" season (or that Season 2 was the best, for that matter: West Wing seems to be one of that rare breed like ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" or ""Fawlty Towers"" that hit the ground running and most enjoyed the freedom of exploring its characters in its premiere season - a freedom and looseness missing in later seasons). Season 4, which will be the last season that any true West Wing fan need bother to purchase, was not as bad as other reviewers are implying. While the Season 4 episodes after ""Inauguration"" rapidly spiral into explosions and melodrama that only a hyperactive network executive desperate for ratings could love, the denouement of the Sorkin tenure era is a masterstroke that was a brilliant way for him to stick it to NBC and prove that great writing, above all else, makes for great shows.

As for Season 3, it continues in the fine tradition of the first two seasons with delightful characters and interesting explorations of the ethical and moral problems regularly faced in government. Sorkin once again shows his mastery of the musical rhythm of dialogue, as well as his distaste for prolonged story arcs (just as in Season 2 he rapidly tried to move past the aftermath of the shooting - except in the incredible Christmas episode - in Season 3 he rapidly tries to move beyond the impacts of the President's admission of MS). Sorkin does deal with the MS implications to an extent, again providing an amazing Christmas episode . . . this time for Leo (which extended for a third year the tradition of the featured character of the Christmas episode winning the Emmy for Supporting Actor). But he seems impatient to move to other, more self-contained episodes, which are his specialty. For the sake of drama, Sorkin simply refuses to belabor issues that in real life would bring Washington to a grinding halt for months, if not an entire Presidential term.

In many ways, Season 3 is the ""Season of Love"" on the West Wing with a backdrop of campaigning, becoming slightly soapier in its explorations of the characters' personal lives. With the exception of the wily Bruno (who tangles beautifully with all of the regulars) and the other new campaign consultants, most of the new recurring characters introduced this season are love interests for one of the regulars. They run the gamut in terms of their successful introduction from Donna's limp Cliff (another in a long line of Republicans who really at heart are virtuous Democrats) to Leo's sharp-tongued and worthy Jordan to Josh's oh-so-annoying Amy (clearly a plot device to put off resolving his romantic tension with Donna) to CJ's sexy and appealing Simon (what is it with Sorkin and shooting or killing likeable characters for his season finales?).

Overall, I highly recommend purchasing this Season on DVD. It does marginalize some characters like Sam and Charlie and certainly there are some misses in the mix such as ""Women of Qumar"" (CJ goes off the deep end) and ""Two Bartlets"" (Toby goes mano e mano with Bartlett in an unbelievably confrontational fashion) but ""Manchester,"" ""Bartlet for America,"" ""Dead Irish Writers"" and ""Posse Commitatus"" more than make up for any occasionaly lapses of greatness. Get ready to enjoy the second-to-last ""great"" season and meantime mourn the absolutely pathetic death by ER that currently continues to mascarade on TV as the show and characters we all once cared about.",1094083200,28,3521,4.924242424242424
2130686,4,B0002WZN9Y,"I am a loyal West Winger, but I have to agree with many other people when I say that season three was the last great season.  I loved Manchester and the kick-off of the campaign.  The whole Josh and Amy thing is great, but we all know that Josh is subconciously in love with Donna.  The Christmas episodes are always my favorites.

  On the other hand I think that fiction mirrored fact a little too much for me.  I watch West Wing to see a country that is somewhat idealized, and Sorkin put a little too much real life into this season.  It was somewhat inevitable, but still if I had wanted real life I would have left my tv on C-SPAN.

  All in all though I gave it 4 stars because it is smart, and leaves the viewer thinking, and just a little bit smarter than before.  West Wing is a great show, and season 3 was not the best (season 2 was the best) but it was still a must watch and now must re-watch show.",1093824000,14,912,4.061797752808989
2130687,4,B0002WZN9Y,"While the episode that was outside their normal story lines was comical and infuriating, it really showed where the series was heading.  It was still the best show on television, and Aaron Sorkin was still in control of the direction of his characters and the Administration policy, but something started to slip.

While many have speculated that a liberal White House, if even fictional, was not shadowing the feelings of the American public after 9/11, I do not think that is where the real decline begins (see all episodes after ""Inauguration Day"" in season four).  Some might say that Season 3 is slow, tedious, and grasping with trying to remain true to the first two season's worth of Democratic Party values while struggling to resonate with the Republican Party's stranglehold on patriotism in the post 9/11 United States.

I dissent in part with that aforementioned opinion.  The real powerhouse that keeps this season going is not the final moments involving CJ's stalker, but of Bartlet's moralism versus the office and duty he has to the American people; the struggling man in the office that demands a god-like foresight to see through tough times.  As he agrees to the assassination you feel the need to wonder if it really will make the fictionalized America within the West Wing anymore safer then if Bush or, hear is hoping, Kerry, had the option of assassinating bin Laden.

It is in Season 3 that we the viewer get to see a fictionalized administration grasping with the pangs of terrorism.  This is as real as you can get without having Bartlet swap parties and trade in his intelligence for inarticulate grammar and stuttering speeches.  It also gives the thoughtful viewer time to reflect and in my humble opinion the last six episodes of season three is what made this series the best drama on television and earned it a third consecutive EMMY for best drama.
