The cartoons of today may be more three-D oriented, but they lack clean scripts. The scripting is intended to promote all unspeakable acts of violence. They are meant to destroy childhoods. Unlike that the classic Flintstones promote clean fun comedy that even the youngest child can enjoy without fear of hearing streams of profanity and spilling guts.
This episode invites kids of all ages to meet a silly charactor for another planet in another galaxy whose smarter than a caveman, at least he thinks he is.
The tape suttley teaches us how to have fun without greed or rough violence.
This cartoon was made at a time when cartoons were for the most part hand drawn and imaginable. The trips and falls were not believible, even a small child knew that,but just silly and fun to watch. They were meant to tickle the whole family with laughter and simply to relax us all after a hard days work.
I will admit that the newest of the Flintstones were a bit stupid(i.e. Pebbles and Bambam shows)but even they made a child or a child at heart feel smarter than the lack of common sense characters being watched.
So just kick off your shoes, grab a cold tall glass of milk, and push in this vhs and enjoy a relaxing cartoon of the Flintstones Meet the Great Gazoo. It's worth owning and watching over and over again. I bought mine on Amazon.",1315094400,,1483,4.578947368421052
