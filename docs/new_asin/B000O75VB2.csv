2791681,5,B000O75VB2,"As a female practioner of JKD for the past three years, I have found this set of instructional DVD's to be of the utmost quality.  Mr. Hajnasr's detailed, step-by-step instruction has helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the original art of Jeet Kune Do. I highly recommend this set for the excellent quality and extensive knowledge Mr. Hajnasr demonstrates. His passion for the art is contagious.",1187481600,7,407,4.985294117647059
2791682,5,B000O75VB2,"Once again George has done an outstanding job on this version to say the least! This Edition is a revised version which still carrys his fire, passion , and enthusiasm for Jeet Kune Do!! He has also made it easy to follow along with professional quality DVD's for anyone to follow to increase their knowledge and skill of JKD'! Great job on a job well done!!

2791683,5,B000O75VB2,This is the best Jeet Kune Do/Martial Arts book and DVD set I have seen.  The book is well written and easy to understand for the beginner and has a great deal of information for the advanced.  I have a large collection of DVD's by some of the most well known Jeet Kune Do/Martial Arts practitioners' and George Hajnasr's set is second to none.,1184630400,3,344,4.359375
2791684,5,B000O75VB2,"George Hajnasr's DVD set is one of the most informative series ever put together on the art of Jun Fan and Jeet Kune Do.  As a Bruce Lee historian who has had over 30 articles published in martial arts magazines across the globe, I can vouch for Mr. Hajnasr's knowledge and skill.  The DVD's are professionally done (an oddity in JKD) and contain a wealth of information that is presented in an easy, yet informative way.  I highly recommend these DVD's.

8183459,5,B000O75VB2,I've been a practitioner of several different martial arts over the years and have had the good fortune to land in Sifu George Hajnasr's class.  The book and DVD dovetail perfectly with the instruction I am receiving.  They both help me review material that I may be on the verge of forgetting and also help me fine tune what I am learning in class.  You'll definitely get your money's worth if you purchase the book and/or the DVD companion.,1407024000,2,442,4.569620253164557
8183460,1,B000O75VB2,"Horrible product that makes a mockery of Bruce Lee's martial art.  The intro especially is overdone, with tasteless rapping and poor execution.",1395792000,,143,5.5
8183461,5,B000O75VB2,"Sifu george does an excellent job in incorporating quite a bit of info into 3 cds. I believe that the essence of jkd was well established by the time of his shocking death. He proclaimed sifu dan inosanto as his head instructor before leaving us. Growing up in hawaii i was exposed and practiced many arts all which fall under the umbrella of jkd..as long as the techniques are useful in your so called matrix. I was fortunate to attend 2 inosanto seminars which included escrima, bjj, bjj w kali sticks, tiger crane kung fu, wing chun, and some full on jkd bjj multiple blitz attacks done by the fastest most proficiant 72 yo ever! He is that amazing! He emphasized basics as does george, but he ads some flavors which is permitted and emphasized as this art evolves. Recently the phillipino art of kina mutai was introduced as a counter to bjj groundfighting. The point is learn and incorporate because one day you or your families life may depend on it.",1369094400,5,956,4.563953488372093
8183462,5,B000O75VB2,I have practiced and trained in Martial Arts for almost 25 years and being from California fortunately I have trained with some of the Greatest martial artists the world has ever seen and also the world has never seen or even heard of . I have yet to meet or train with Mr Hajnasr but when I decided to look into his material on video I again saw the same skills that make a good instructor and Martial artist .,1353715200,4,411,4.15
8183463,2,B000O75VB2,"The product review states that the Instructor on this DVD ""is the founder of Jeet Kune Do the System Without a System(r).""  Now....technically I guess if he incorporates ""the System without a System"" in the title of HIS system....its legal...BUT....everyone who studies Martial Arts knows that Bruce Lee founded Jeet Kun Do and nobody else.  I wanted very much to purchase this DVD but hesitate because of this claim.  I have studied other Martial Arts and attended seminars on Jeet Kun Do so I wanted to possibly incorporate more of it in my training.  While the content of this product may be exceptional...I take issue with the Instructor's claim.  Its an insult to the memory and accomplishments of a stellar Martial Artist.",1296691200,11,728,4.934426229508197
8183464,1,B000O75VB2,"First of all I am a former Marine who is currently a student of Shun Hsin Dao (Heart, Mind, and Body's Way).  This form of self defense was developed by my instructor who is the founder.  He is also a former Marine who served in Vietnam as a sniper and is highy skilled in several types of self-defense including a black belt in Karate and weapons training which implements many Jeet Kune Do principles as well as his own.  Yet my instructor's teachings are far more advanced than the instructor's teachings on his video by far.  Such as, how to properly take the effectiveness out of a side kick and how certain hits will affect the internal organs in such a way that death is a probability.  My personal feelings is that George Hajnasr's video is a marketing tool for his school and it shows he is full of himself.  His techniques and teaching are repititous such as that of Karate.  Anyone highly skilled will know that the body will not remain in the same position after being struck.  Therefore, repititous drills are a waste of time.  Bruce Lee planted a seed such as, ""The attacker always gives himself away"".  In George's video he mainly demonstrates his skills as an attack and not as a ""Good defense is the best offense""  He lacks explanation in his demonstrations except for the Chinese names of certain techniques he managed to memorize so he could show off.  There is no explanation about awareness, sensitivity, or forward progression following a block.  I personally could counter several of George's attacks with my level of skill that would be quite damaging physically.  There are many unwise techniques taught by George that invites very damaging counters. George also used a segment of this video to show off his 7 year old son which was a bunch of BS.  This was not instructional at all.  Another thing is that his movement in showing techniques is not that of instructor who is trying to teach.  Many of his movements were so quick you have to make sure to press slow play to view his technique.  Once viewed there are so many flaws that I am confident my training is far more advanced than his students.  I personally hated how much time George wasted on his music videos showing techniques or drills in motion throughout the video.  Now another thing is his instruction on taking an opponent to the ground is ridiculous.  You may be able to pull these techniques on a drunk or someone who is physically dominated by your power but I do not recommend these.  If you go to the ground with your opponent you are defenseless to attacks from bystanders who may be in defense of the opponent.  Therefore, you should never go to the ground and if so you should do whatever it takes to get back to your feet such as biting, scratching, breaking fingers, gouging eyes, etc....",1220400000,18,2791,4.605263157894737
8183465,5,B000O75VB2,this guy is a master and you will want this dvd because it's easy to follow and his teachings is that clear so i recommend this to all beginners and intermediates.,1219622400,7,163,4.290322580645161
8183466,5,B000O75VB2,Like many people I reviewed the many favorable reviews with a certain skepticism. But upon reviewing the DVD I know why it received such favorable ratings. It a very complete representation of JKD. Which is what I wanted an overview of the many facets of JKD. I'm now taking classes but our instuctor is jumping around on so many different aspects that its tough to learn. I wanted some supplemental instruction and have received it in these DVD's. Dont be afraid to purchase if you want a good overall view of JKD. However if your really interested in becoming good at JKD you should take classes from a qualified instructor also.,1194048000,14,631,4.693693693693693
