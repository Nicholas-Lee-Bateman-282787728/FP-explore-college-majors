Not bad as in funny to laugh at how bad it is. Just bad.

Yes. We get it. Jack Benny was gay. Yet every scene seems to have a point where he's visibly recoiling from a woman.

How may times can you listen to him say ""Robchester, stop that""? Twenty, I think, was my limit.",1467417600,,487,4.0

7879825,5,630487281X,"This movie is really bad.  So bad it's good.  Anyone can make a terrible movie, but this movie is the king of all bad movies.  Very funny.  If you don't get it the first time, try it again under the influence of something and then you will see it's brilliance.  It is a masterpiece.

Format:  VHS, Beta?",1259193600,,303,4.2105263157894735
7879826,3,630487281X,"If you actually know who Jet Benny is a emulating, if you grew up with a black and white television with only three network stations from which to choose, or if the family cow stood next to the porch waiting to be milked and fed while you tuned your fiddle for some after dinner music, then you will understand the quiet humor in this film spoof. It's a little slow at times, but is still funny if you are old enough to understand. My VHS copy picked up at a friends of the library sale was a well used and almost worn out video store retiree, so at least one other person must have liked it for what it is, a low budget spoof. I give 1 star for actually creating and filming this production, 1 star for creating the film effects, and 1 star for getting this released on video. You also must realize, this is obviously the result of actual filmmaking, not quick and cheesy u-tube generation video. I was amused enough to justify the couple dollars spent on this old VHS video copy.",1207872000,3,981,4.279569892473118
