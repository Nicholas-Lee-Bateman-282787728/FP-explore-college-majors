7306181,5,B01088HF42,It's great to finally see what you've heard for years. Taste was a fantastic group and Rory is just balls to the wall on all of these songs.,1442707200,5,140,4.035714285714286
7306182,5,B01088HF42,"I admit I had not heard of this band until I saw this item displayed to me by Amazon only because I had purchased other Isle of Wight concerts in 1970 (The Who, Jimi Hendrix all of which are excellent). It's such a great feeling when you discover new music even if it is from the 60s (after all that was the best decade for music). I can hardly listen to anything new on the radio, quite honestly they don't interest me at all. I am constantly amazed by the quality of the music created by the artists in the 60s (most iconic rock artists all started in the 60s, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, etc.). I was totally blown away by the music- it sounded to me like a crossover between Jimi Hendrix and Cream (Eric Clapton) and yet it is definitely unique and not an imitation. This band totally rocked!!!! And the Blu-ray transfer is fantastic, I might say it is probably the best Blu-ray transfer from this era (like I said, I own the other Isle of Wight concerts which are mostly filmed in the dark at night). I also own the Woodstock film. Blu-ray here is crsipy clear video and audio. If the fashion style and colors didn't tip you off, you might even think this was shot only a few years ago. I think the fact that it was shot during the afternoon/evening was a big advantage. If you liked the aforementioned artists, you will definitely love this blu-ray. I personally fell in love with and even bought the ""Taste I'll Remember"" The Box Set audio CD collection. (PS - There is also quite a bit extras on the disc, nice and sweet interviews with the musicians, like Bob Geldof, Edge (of U2), etc. and some video clips).",1499040000,4,1676,4.392282958199357

7306189,5,B01088HF42,I had not been exposed to Rory Gallagher's virtuosity before seeing this video.  The guy could flat out play and this blu ray has great footage of Taste in concert and great interviews with people who knew Rory both family and fans and other musicians.  I really enjoyed it.,1476057600,2,274,4.571428571428571
7306190,5,B01088HF42,"I had not listened to much of Taste's work, though I had listened to a lot of Rory's solo work.  This DVD is a fantastic insight into his time and music with Taste.  I had no sense of scale of the Isle of Wight festival before...I truly feel the immensity of it now, looking though a lens into 1970.  The audio quality is good, but if you don't like how Rory's voice goes in and out at times, oh well - it seems to be his singing style, at least in live performance!  I often have to see people actually playing an instrument to understand the complexity of the music, to see where it comes from on a physical level, and the camerawork is on point in that regard.  The interviews are great as well - I heard/saw several bits of interviews I had previously watched on Youtube, but I don't mind that at all - if anything, it gives me a sense of ""yeah, I did my research!"".  The film is an excellent compilation of material, and a worthy tribute to the time of Taste.  Highly recommend it <3",1475193600,7,988,4.168421052631579
7306191,4,B01088HF42,Rory never disappoints! Great set considering the era from which this was taken.,1469923200,,80,5.230769230769231

7306195,5,B01088HF42,"So glad that this awesome performance finally has been released!  It's sad that Taste weren't able to continue as a group because, as this film shows, they were a force to be reckoned with!  A must for Rory fans, as he is absolutely tearing it up here!",1457827200,5,252,4.340425531914893

7306198,5,B01088HF42,They broke up right after the biggest gig of their career but played like they were on fire.  They deliver the goods.  Highly recommended for fans and new fans.,1454889600,2,160,4.482758620689655
7306199,5,B01088HF42,"I saw Taste at the Midwest Rock Festival (Late 60's) and later, Rory Gallagher play at a small club in Milwaukee called Hump'n Hannas. (Early 70's). I shook his hand that night. Awesome guitar player.",1454112000,,200,4.742857142857143
7306200,5,B01088HF42,"Finally able to view Rory's entire performance instead of having to view as individual YouTube videos.  Its great and you get to see firsthand why he was one of the highlights of the festival.  Outstanding performances by all players, plus some nice extras make this a ""must have"" for anyone but especially for us Rory fanatics!",1452124800,,328,4.839285714285714

7306202,5,B01088HF42,"This video is a historical document as well as a brilliant performance video. Without spoiling the historical element, I will say Rory Gallagher and Taste emerged as among the first Irish bands to hit the global scene in the late 1960's. Think we were spoiled by The Experience, Cream and Grand Funk? Buy this video and see for yourself.",1449792000,4,337,4.728813559322034

7306205,5,B01088HF42,"Awesome concert and hard to believe this was their final show knowing it was their final show! The interviews add an interesting insight to the group and Rory and what probably broke them up, or you can just watch the show itself.  I only wish it had also included all the encores.",1448582400,4,281,4.403846153846154

7306213,5,B01088HF42,"This concert reminds me of Jimi Hendrix Woodstock DVD.  I mean, I know they are different players but what I mean by this is you put it on, it starts off like a freight train slowly leaving the station and when they finally get out on the tracks, they turn the throttle up all the way and they are rolling like crazy!  Half way through this show, your jaw just starts to drop.  Now could somebody please release the footage from Isle of Wight of Family?  I know it exists because there are cuts from it on You Tube.",1445385600,4,515,4.171717171717172

7306216,5,B01088HF42,"This is a must have for any Rory fan. The opening documentary is short, but very informative with interviews from various artists ( Bob Geldof and Brian May to name a couple) and other people associated with the Isle of Wight event ( Donal Gallagher and the director of the film have the best info).  This may have been the end of Taste, but Rory was only getting started. When you look at the stage that they played on, by today's standards even opening acts getter better set-ups, but this film shows that it's the performance here that really counts. The doc tells us that the guys had already decided that this was their last show together, but you would never have been able to tell by their playing. Again, if you are into Rory you have to have this show!",1445212800,6,761,4.397163120567376

7306219,5,B01088HF42,"Holy Cow .....what we have here is beyond historic perspective of one of the tightest little trio's rock has ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
What really makes this historic besides the excellent quality of the filmed concert from the Isle of Wight in 1970, we get to see the rare fully restored Beat club sessions from 1970 with a full version of ""It's Happened Before, It'll Happen Again"" with Rory playing the saxophone as recorded on the 2nd Taste offering ""On The Boards"", amazing and from my angle a magical moment in Taste history. I highly recommend picking up a copy of the 4 CD set ""I'll Remember"" a worthy tribute to Taste and to Rory Gallagher, without a doubt the worlds greatest innovator and guitar showman the world has ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Bar none and hands down worth every penny and then some.",1443830400,11,837,4.662162162162162

7306221,5,B01088HF42,"A must have if you're a Rory fan, there is a really nice documentary about Taste and Rory with the concert songs inserted in full screen 1.78.1 format, and also an option for just the concert footage in the correct 1.33.1 pillar boxed format.

Thank God they finally released this before I died.. Killer guitarist Rory Gallagher playing live with his band Taste before he went solo is just amazing to see. Mainly because besides a few albums in the early 70s, there's hardly any footage of him before his long great solo career. This is a must-get if you love great blues,hard rock or just great guitarists. The bonus footage of tv appearances, and music videos are just ok.  It's the live show from The Isle of White thats a mindblower",1532217600,,666,4.516666666666667

8721551,4,B01088HF42,"This is an absolute gem. Filmed on the third day of the five day festival, Friday 28 August, 1970, by the great filmmaker Murray Lerner. Lerner made a career out of documenting music through the 60s (notably the Newport Folk Festivals including Bob Dylan's infamous electric performance in 1965). He got the contract to film the entire Isle of Wight Festival of 1970 and then never got paid so he fought a three year legal battle to claim the rights to the footage. We should all be so glad he got those rights as he devoted the rest of his life to editing the footage into a series of documentaries on each of the great artists he filmed there, including Jimi Hendrix, Leonard Cohen, The Who, The Moody Blues, Emerson, Lake & Palmer etc... This documented performance by Rory Gallagher's powerhouse three-piece rock-blues outfit is riveting from start to finish. The band are at their highest energy levels from the first song and it is fascinating to witness how, by about the third song, the band locks into a very tight groove and just pumps out a raw and infectious blues. Rory plays a mean slide on some songs and the whole performance could be compared to John lee Hooker on steroids. The editing of the camera work is stunning. Lots of intimate close-up shots Rory's face and fingerwork. Lerner had about five cameras on his shoots, all the latest compact 16mm cameras from the look of them. The logistics of filming this stuff in those days must have been immense, with each roll of film only lasting nine minutes or so. In some shots you can see all the rows of film canisters at the side of the stage.",1518825600,2,1612,4.562068965517241

8721553,4,B01088HF42,It may seem like something is missing but considering the time it was filmed & the rising talent to come.. It's pretty cool someone thought enough to record it. Cheers to them!,1502928000,,176,4.53125
