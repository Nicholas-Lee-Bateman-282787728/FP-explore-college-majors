2400318,2,B000B5XOVG,"Please note that this is not a review for kids.  It's a review for critically minded adults who very much liked all the spongebob episodes from the first three seasons.  I own all episodes from the first 3 seasons on DVD collections, and watch them regularly.  There is a sharp shift from those seasons to the 4th season.  (The episodes on this disc are 4th season.)  The comedic timing is off in every 4th season episode that I've seen, including all those on this disc.  The characters have shifted, and the net effect is a work that seems to be based on Spongebob while completely missing the mark.  ""The Great Snail Race,"" the only 3rd season episode on this disc, highlights the fact that all the 4th season episodes are unwatchable.  I read one review that said something to the effect of, ""if you have the first 3 seasons, keep those and pass this disc by.""  I didn't  listen.",1177718400,,883,4.49685534591195
2400319,5,B000B5XOVG,"Ok, so these are not the best episodes from the fourth season. And yes, the other seasons in the show are better than this season. However, this episodes aren't totally bad! The only that I didn't really enjoy was ""Good Neighbor,"" but it also wasn't completely horrible. The other episodes besides ""Good Neighbor"" were terrific! Here are the episodes this DVD contains, and the grade I give them.

1) Have You Seen This Snail? (double-lengh episode): A+
2) The Lost Mattress: A-
3) Krabs vs. Plankton: A
4) Good Neighbor: B- or C+
5) Skill Crane: A+++
6) The Great Snail Race (not from Season 4): A

The episodes are fantastic and worth buying! The only ""let-down"" is that the DVD contains 6 episodes, instead of the usual 8 or 10. Also, the Special Features could have been better. The only Special Feature was the ""Gary's Karaoke"" feature, which was a sing-along of the song sung in the ""Have You Seen This Snail?"" episode.

Anyway, if you're a true SpongeBob SquarePants fan - buy this DVD! You won't regret it! Buy it and laugh out loud with everyone's favorite underwater sea sponge! Make your purchase now! ^_^",1150243200,3,1116,4.654822335025381
2400320,3,B000B5XOVG,"NOTE: This may contain spoilers for ""Skill Crane.""

I swear to you, I really love Spongebob. However, these recent episodes lack the hilarious moments from the first three seasons. The only reason you should think about buying this DVD is for the Great Snail Race, which is a great episode.

Have You Seen This Snail?-There is nothing wrong with this episode, but it's just not as funny. On the other hand, the animation and background art are both very good, we see a lot of places that we haven't.

The Lost Mattress-I think this was the first Sponegbob episode that I ever hated. The gags are done wrong, the setup is predictable (Squidward says, ""This time, I'm not gonna get hurt,"" so it's even more obvious than it was before!)

Krabs vs. Plankton-Eh, seemed rushed, and the jokes had bad pacing. Also, it was just not amsing.

Good Neighbor-Spongebob and Patrick ruin Squid's life. That's okay, it's part of the series. However, unlike hilarious episodes like ""opposite day"" where it's probably Squidward's fault in the first place, here they just do it out of stupidity! We find ourselves feeling bad for Squidward, which is not supposed to happen!

Skill Crane-(spoilers) This episode is actually funny up until Squidward gets a prize. He then becomes even more unlikable and goes so far as to taunt little kids! It also gets way too random at that point, with an ending that is not randomly funny (like the gorilla end of ""I Had An Accident."") Here, it's just stupid.

The Great Snail Race-BEST EPISODE ON THIS DVD! Witty lines, good jokes, and it stars Gary. I cannot begin to rave about how good it is, especially in comparison of these other episodes.",1145232000,2,1664,4.737024221453288
2400321,5,B000B5XOVG,"This tape was the best of all spongebob's dvd!!!

my favorite episode was where's gary, it will break your heart

GARY PLEASEEEEE COMEEEE HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO",1137456000,,200,6.96
2400322,4,B000B5XOVG,"My oldest sister says the fourth season of Spongebob sucks altogether. I wouldn't say that it fully sucks-it's just not as funny as the previous seasons. So here we have a decent collection of shorts from the beginning of the fourth season made shortly after the departure of creator Stephen Hillenburg:

Have You Seen This Snail?: For once, a double-length episode of Spongebob that's truly 30 minutes long and not marred half of the episode by the annoyance of Patchy the Pirate. However, this episode doesn't carry the comedic punch we'd expect, simply because it has more heart. Gary runs away after Spongebob rejects him from feeding him for the arrival of his new paddle-ball toy, and later finds a new home for an overtreating old lady. It's a good episode, by and large. 8/10

The Lost Mattress: Spongebob and Patrick find a new mattress to help Mr. Krabs' back, only to realize they threw away Krabs' old mattress carrying all of his money in it. Lots of funny dialogue, but the gags needed to come in at a better timing. 7/10

Krabs vs. Plankton: In another attempt to steal the Krabby Patty formula, Plankton slips on a puddle from Spongebob's mop and fails. So Plankton sues Krabs putting his life possessions and formula at stake. This episode has its moments, but a concept like this makes the episode too predictable; We all know who wins in the end. 5/10

Good Neighbors: Spongebob and Patrick ruin Squidward's day again by pronouncing him President of the Good Neighbors' club. A novelty episode with great gags, especially in the second half... 9/10

Skill Crane: The highlight of this DVD. Those who love cartoons focused on simple subjects like's Donald Duck's TROMBONE TROUBLE will appreciate this episode, because it focuses on Squidward trying to win a prize from a crane game. Loaded with hilarious gags. 10/10

In addition, you'll also get The Great Snail Race, even though it's also on the Spongebob Goes Prehistoric DVD. And that's it. This is a slightly shorter collection of shorts than the single-disc DVDs. It would've been nice to get a few more 4th season gems like Funny Pants or Patrick Smartpants. Still, a decent collection overall.
