7888859,5,6305310955,"Another great movie from the Yuen clan. This one has Tsui Siu Ming(who also co-directed) and Yuen Shun Yee(A.K.A. Yuen Hsin Yee) as two orphan friends who were trained in martial arts since they were very young. After being  together for a long time,Shun Yee has to leave and work in a near by  town. Siu Ming on the other hand stays at the monastery and is framed for  rape and murder by a greedy shop owner(Li Hai Sheng),and forced to steal a  giant jade buddha. When Shun Yee's stepfather overhears Siu Ming and the  shop owner talking,he's caught and tortured by Siu Ming. When Shun Yee  returns to the country,he goes on a search for his stepfather,eventually  finding that the villian is his best friend,which leads to the final  confrontation of friend vs. friend. This movie came out in 1980 at a time  when the Yuen clan's choreography seemed to get better with each movie. A  lot of familiar faces in this movie. Yuen Siu Tin,Yuen Cheung Yan,Yuen Chun  Yeung,and Yuen Yat Chor all have cameo roles. It's too bad that Yuen Shun  Yee wasn't a bigger star on screen. He was definately great as a villian in  films such as Drunken Tai-Chi,Dreadnaught,and the Miracle Fighter films. But  he also proved himself as a good guy in this film as well as Dance of the  Drunk Mantis. He shows up every now and then in films and he still does a  lot of choreography work. The last thing I saw him in was Iron Monkey as the  righteous manchu soldier.",955152000,7,1446,4.478927203065134
