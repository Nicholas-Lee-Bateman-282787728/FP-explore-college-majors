Notified the seller and returned the product.  I haven't heard from them at all.  No refund which was confirmed and never rec'd.
What a rip off.",1352073600,4,299,4.566037735849057
4596996,4,B0057M208G,"Video quality was not HD....however it was very acceptable.  The only problem were that the subtitles, they were not very well done.  Parts of sentences were missing or parts of sentences would flash on screen for one or two frames...so fast that it could not be read....not a huge problem.  Those who are into Korean Dramas would enjoy despite the minor problems with the subtitles.",1319068800,4,383,4.861538461538461

8460858,1,B0057M208G,"I ordered this Item because of my wife special demand and appeal for it. The packaging was intact and everything was okay only to discover upon watching that NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE. Returning the item is not an option because of the cost involved but I believe this Review Platform is the avenue that I have to show my DISPLEASURE.

Amazon should have a verification unit to verify claims of their vendors.
