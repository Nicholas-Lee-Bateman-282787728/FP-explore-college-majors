Don't knock anything that will get you off your heinie and moving! Thank you for this opportunity to get started on a workout program.",1480291200,,308,4.15

7950302,2,B00005QCY1,I was very disappointed when I started this and Richard Simmons isn't on it....I felt like there was no organization and NO correct direction most of the time. Also felt that it had you over exert yourself on some of these when they are suppose to be for us older folks. I would not recommend it at all....,1056326400,8,306,4.293103448275862
7950303,2,B00005QCY1,"If you are thinking this tape is a second volume of Richard Simmons and the Silver Foxes, think again. Richard Simmons never appears on this video, in spite of his name being on the listing. Instead, the stars' parents do it all themselves in what is billed as a ""non-aerobic, full-body conditioning and stretching program."" The exercises, such as they are, might be useful for older people who have never done any exercise and need just to get moving; however, the production is disorganized and amateurish. Golf clubs and tennis rackets are used as props for some exercises, which I suppose is to make us think the exercises have something to do with those sports--but in reality, they don't. The beginning and end contain advertising for a food supplement and other products that one suspects is the real reason this tape was produced. If you are serious about getting a senior-level workout, stick with the real Simmons tape and continue your search.",1012953600,64,954,4.895061728395062
