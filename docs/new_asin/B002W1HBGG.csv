4003703,5,B002W1HBGG,"It clearly states ""action from"" and does not include everygame but the highlights are execellent.  It is the typical NFL films film which is the best on the market.
It's narrated and the Super Bowl is the broadcast with no narration but the real play by play.
Seeing this game by game builds the dramam slowly through the entire season.  It is perfect especially if you are a Saints fan.
FYI:  This comnes on ESPN and the NFL network so if you have a recorder!?!?",1266969600,12,463,4.423529411764706

I found it very enjoyable to watch and well worth the money. I am a big Saints fan though so I am biased.

4003778,1,B002W1HBGG,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

Basically, if you want to see a highlight reel to relive the memories of the Saints 2009 season & 1st Super Bowl victory along with the presentation of the Lombardi trophy after the game (best feature of the disk), buy this set.  If you want to see the Super Bowl XLIV game, buy the ""Road to XLIV"" set.  Both should be viewed as must have purchases for diehard Saints fans!",1327190400,12,572,4.229357798165138

4003784,4,B002W1HBGG,"For $8, you couldn't have asked for more with this DVD. But just so you know, this is more-or-less a documentary-style overview of the season -- you don't get any full games from the season. Aside from the tacky intro about Hurricane Katrina at the beginning of the DVD, this is a great way to relive everything about the season.

A few of the more uneventful games are omitted for the sake of time, I guess, but you get the best highlights. From the unlikely comeback at Miami at the beginning of the season to the 38-17 dismantling of the Patriots on Monday Night Football, the DVD has you covered.

The DVD extras are the only part of this DVD I would say are lacking. There's a pretty gloomy feature on one Saints player, footage from media day before the Super Bowl and The Who's halftime performance (which is not nearly quite as good as I remember it being when I drunkenly saw it live at a bar on Decatur Street). Not a bad DVD for the price, but diehard fans may want to check out a DVD of the Super Bowl in its entirety to supplement the documentary.",1297900800,,1060,4.321608040201005

Highlights and important plays from each of the games of the season are on it with the Super Bowl win at the end. We love the DVD and have watched it many, many times.  No it doesn't show the entire Super Bowl - or any game.  It also includes conversations and comments by miked players during the games.

We love the DVD and are ordering another, just in case something happpens to the originial one we bought.",1296345600,2,546,4.171428571428572
4003797,1,B002W1HBGG,"I wanted a copy of the Superbowl.  This was advertised as that.  All it is cuts and clips of the 2009 season and highlights of the Superbowl.

4003798,4,B002W1HBGG,"Just what i wanted, just the right balance between the in match action and the sideline banter, it manages to build up each game and then convey the brilliance of each and every one of them. Sometimes the length of the match highlihts for particular games are not very long which can be frustrating and if i had one main problem with the DVD, it would be that in most games the highlights only include key touchdowns and not every score, this can be fairly confusing and in the regular season takes away some of the magic, however these are made up for by the rest of the movie.
The playoffs and then the superbowl are shown in good detail which is good and also, these stages contain lots of sideline footage and other extra film, this obviously ends up with the magical moment of the Neq Orleans Saints winning the Superbowl, i believe that this is captured well and the aftermath of the superbowl on the whole is shown very well.

Overall, i think that this product is Brilliant for its price and is a must buy for any Saints fan. WHO DAT!",1291161600,,1042,4.371134020618556
4003799,5,B002W1HBGG,This is a great recap of the Saints Super Bowl season. Not too long to watch yet it shows the highs and lows of the season. It does NOT contain any full games but is well worth it for any true Saints fan.,1284163200,,204,3.7674418604651163

4003802,3,B002W1HBGG,"The New Orleans Saints Super Bowl XLIV highlight package is rather average, but a bit better than the last few years.  Of course, for any New Orleans fan it is a great keepsake, no doubt.

The feature of all the team specific Super Bowl highlight packages is about an hour long highlights reel of the New Orleans Saints regular season.  This year's edition does a decent job of showing the key highlights of every regular season game.  It moves at a much faster clip than most years, or at least seems to, and doesn't even tease at making an attempt at building up any drama, which is the greatest failure of most of these highlight packages.  But unlike many previous years, where the film unsuccessfully feigns drama building, at least in this one you get what you get, a nice, fast paced journey through the New Orleans Saints' 2009 season.  There is nothing particularly special about it, unless you are a Saints fan, and is entertaining enough if you are not.

This edition, however, does a horrific job of building up any of the drama of the Saints' postseason.  It certainly shows all the Saints highlights from the Saints point of view.  But the drama building, especially of the Saints very close playoff win against the Minnesota Vikings, and their very close (despite the final score of 31-17) Super Bowl win over the Indianapolis Colts is simply a joke.  You'd think the overtime victory against the Vikings and the win against the Colts were undramatic, almost foregone conclusions watching this compilation.  It just does a completely lousy job of it.

Worse yet, there are very few close breakdowns of dramatic plays and events during the season, and of the NFC Championship and Super Bowl wins.  It's just a simply a highlights reel from the Saints' perspective, and that is about it.

The Bonus Features are also a huge let down. You get the postgame celebrations, NFL media day, the halftime show, and a short personal close-up of the travails of Saints defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove, which is really the best of the Bonus Features.  The Bonus Features are simply thin and not very good.

The Saints made history with their first and rather dramatic win in Super Bowl XLIV.  While any Saints and NFL fan will enjoy the journey, the video robs the viewer of just what an amazing and dramatic run it really was.",1277078400,,2331,4.716049382716049

4003804,5,B002W1HBGG,I am a Saints Fan and I got this dvd for memories. It shows highlights from all the games from game one to XLIV. This is a must for your Who Dat collection!,1272326400,,156,3.757575757575758
4003818,5,B002W1HBGG,"I thought this was going to be the Super Bowl game.  Wanted the game with the Saints broadcasters announcing, and knew that was not going to happen but, since I do not have television hookup, it would be a chance to see the game.  This was not the Super Bowl Game -- IT WAS BETTER!!!  It is an overview of the entire season -- pictures of key plays and commenting by Hokie and Jim with occasional comments by the announcers for the opposing team (sometimes comments by both sides on a play).  I got all those wonderful statements by Jim (""fleur-de-leap"" and ""pigs do fly; hell has frozen over"") AND got to see the key plays -- all the way through the Super Bowl.  Then, the cherry on top, as the credits are run at the end, you get to see the Lombardy-gras parade.  Still want a copy of the complete Super Bowl game to watch, but this is by far the best of all the Saints videos I purchased this year.",1271980800,,901,4.209302325581396

4003820,4,B002W1HBGG,"The title is indeed misleading. However, this is an excellent highlight reel of the 2009 Saints season, through the eyes of NFL Films, often with audio from the Saints radio broadcast crew, as well as that of the various opposing teams. It's great to watch the SB XLIV highlights start with Sean Payton telling the refs, before the game starts, the type of onside kick he plans to call.

What's not so great is that there were a lot more highlights available on [...], of SB XLIV, which didn't make it onto this DVD. Still, this looks great on Blu Ray and is a joy for any Saints fan to watch.",1271203200,,593,4.342342342342342
4003821,5,B002W1HBGG,I could actually watch this over again!  It was a great look at the highlights of the season and the Superbowl!  I got all excited again watching it-- Have lent it out to several friends for their viewing and they liked it too! WHO DAT!?  WE DAT!!!!,1271203200,,249,4.25531914893617
4003822,5,B002W1HBGG,"I knew in advance that this was going to be a film highlighting the Saints 2009 championship season, so I was not expecting the entire Super Bowl broadcast. I gave this Five stars because of the quality of what was presented. Each game was adequatley covered with suffcient plays to give the viewer the feel of the game, although some games had plays shown out of order to drive home a point. The picture quality is superb, with multiple angles shown for key plays. But the real treat is the sound. From local Saints announcer Jim Henderson's calls (""It's good!!!! It's good!!! Pigs have flown, Hell has frozen over, the Saints are in the Super Bowl!""), to Coach Payton calling and predicting plays and making insighful comments (describing the on sides kick to referees before the start of the game and encouraging young kicker Garrett Hartley to kick the game winning field goal in the Vikings playoff game ""You belong here""), to Scott Fujita egging on Peyton Manning (""Hey Peyton, I can eat Oreo cookies faster than you""), to Reggie Bush on the sideline predicting a Piere Thomas Super Bowl touchdown on a screen pass and celebrating as if he had scored himself, to the post-game celebrations. Everything presented is of five star quality.

The only problem is it leaves you wanting more. I would have liked more highlights from each game and was disappointed in the brief segment of the Saints history, which quickly showed Archie Manning having hard luck and fans wearing bags over their heads. You do not feel the pain and frustration brought on by the stumbling Saints of old. Nor do you get to relive the truly great moments. No John Gilliam returning the opening kickoff of the team's first game for a touchdown. No Tom Dempsey kicking his game winning record setting 63-yard field goal.

The extra segments also leave you wanting more. But a review should review what is present in the film and not harp on what is missing. You get the key plays of each game of the Saints spectacular season with pristine images and the exciting calls of the local radio broadcasters. It's a film Saints fans can and will watch over and over again, particualrly during the summer when there is no live NFL football to watch.",1270771200,,2218,4.713917525773196

4003825,5,B002W1HBGG,I really enjoyed watching this DVD.  Listening to the Saint's radio announcers is a real treat.  Much better than the network fellows.  I was really looking forward to seeing Darren Sharper's 2 90 yard interceptions again and was not disappointed.  The side line footage adds to the fun.  I saw several reviewers of the NFC Championship game were sorry the DVD did not have any of the post-game celebrations.  This DVD does.  It's a great souvenir of an unbelievable season.

I purchased this Blu-Ray because I wanted to watch the superbowl in its entirety again; as well as years to come.

If you want to be able to watch the whole game, don't waste your money; cause this DVD doesn't have it. VERY DISAPPOINTED.

I guess I'll try iTunes like a commenter suggested to the other 1 star reviewer. Don't waste your money here like I did unless you're happy with nothing but highlights. I'm not.

It's really well written, and is split up into 3 main segments.  The first is a prologue that profiles the history of the team (briefly) and sets up the Katrina and post-Katrina struggles of the city and the team.  The next segment includes a significant amount of high definition highlights from the regular season and playoffs.  They don't skimp on the highlights either - they do a great job of telling the story of each individual game, supported by lots of highlights and game film with the unforgettable calls of Jim Henderson and Hokie Gajan of WWL Saints Radio.

The last segment highlights the Super Bowl.  A good amount of player interviews put the game's significance front and center, and you are then immersed in Super Bowl XLIV.  After a brief conclusion, Saints fans are treated to scenes from the Super Bowl victory parade on ""DAT Tuesday"" during ""Lombardi Gras.""

There are a decent amount of special features - highlighting Jabari Hargrove, Sean Payton, Deuce McAllister, and Jeremy Shockey.  There's also significant Saints coverage and interviews from Super Bowl Media Day.

All in all, it's worth every penny.",1268179200,3,1254,4.872641509433962
4003854,5,B002W1HBGG,"This Blu-ray is worth the price! At first, I debated purchasing it because it didn't show the entire Super Bowl but this is better. It tells a great story going game by game with great commentary from Jim Henderson and WWL radio. I was happy when they showed us winning and still a bit upset when they showed the 3 game losing streak. I choked up a bit (again) when they showed Hartley nail the winning FG in the NFC Championship game.

The story is told from a definitively Saints and Who Dat Nation perspective. It's like no one else matters, not even Peyton Manning, he's an after thought (in the film). They do a good job of capturing the spirit of the Saints, season, each game and the Super Bowl.

If you are a Saints fan this is a must buy and if you're not you'll still enjoy a great film.",1268179200,25,797,4.2368421052631575
4003855,4,B002W1HBGG,"This exciting montage of clips from the season is seamlessly woven into a narrative for one of the most storied seasons and franchises in the last few decades of the NFL. And--in true NFL Film fashion--you see and hear a great deal that you miss out on in the live telecasts. These documentary-style films show the personal side of the game, and in this particular film, you see a team striving to make history for a long-troubled franchise. Sure, (like others who have commented) I would like to see a complete telecast of the Super Bowl--as the NFL has released for the NFC Championship and three other regular season games--but the highlights from the Super Bowl do make up the most significant portion of the film's two-hour run. The documentary even captures the record-breaking victory parade held for the Saints after in New Orleans. While I can't speak for the DVD, the Bluray has absolutely stunning picture and takes us to the Superdome and to Miami in a way that even a regular HD telecast just can't do. I'll be pleased to watch over and over as we relive the miracle 2009-2010 season.",1268092800,4,1097,4.689119170984456
4003856,4,B002W1HBGG,"I liked everything about the dvd. It contains highlight from the start of 2009 season to SB 44. The only prob. with this dvd is narrator since this is the first Super Bowl champs dvd that did not get narrated by harry kalas.

R.I.P. Harry. If he were alive i would have given 5 star rating.",1268006400,,290,4.178571428571429

a good one to buy.
