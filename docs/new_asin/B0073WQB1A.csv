8509506,5,B0073WQB1A,"This odd collection is like a spectacularly horrifying combination of MST3k and South Park (especially hearkening to Terrance and Phillip).  The description provided gives a pretty good idea of what's going on here.  It's a collection of short reels with dopey commentary between them.  Scooper and Uncle Farts' dialogue is crass and blunt, but kind of funny (helped by its brevity).  Thankfully it doesn't interfere with the films, just kind of acts as filler between reels.

These movies are all silent reels.  The musical backgrounds added seem pretty random.  Surfer music, Jazz, a fast rapid Latin beat (though that did accompany a Vanessa Del Rio reel, so there may be some design in the music choices).

Over the two DVDs, the movie reels themselves run the gamut of general-audience, explicit erotica.  Simple straight couples, lesbian, some rather rough films (not brutal or gory, but violent), threesomes (MMF and FFM)....  Nothing too exotic, but it's a good sampling of what was shown in the 70s.

The actors are as they were in 1970s porn reels; almost all natural, a variety of body styles and attractiveness, and there is hair (for those with phobias).",1370390400,,1167,5.026041666666667
