8435318,3,B004LYNE9A,"This is a DVD that reviews the basics of using plastics for bass.  If you have any present day experience, this would merely be a review or a chronology of how things were back in ""the day.""  Don't misunderstand me; these techniques are still effective, and often still used in tournament.  Things like dropshot, shakey head, ned rig, etc. were not widespread when this video was made.  This tape covers carolina, mojo, split-shot rigging and technique.  It even has a section for the floating worm. I watched it once.  Then put it away in my DVD library.",1506297600,,555,4.670103092783505
