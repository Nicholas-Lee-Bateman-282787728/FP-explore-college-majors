8650673,3,B000NTQNS6,"I purchased my first copy of this set years ago and was very satisfied. Paul Champion is a master at his craft and the material is presented at a pace I found to be ideal for me. This is a personal thing and your milage may vary. After a few years of sitting on the shelf, I decided to revisit this material only to find out disc #1 would not play any longer. I decided to try my luck here on Amazon and order a used version. Imagine my disapointment to see that disc #1 from this ""new"" (to me) set would not function either.
The folks at Gnomon will have nothing to do with these discs unless I purchased these discs directly from them. I wonder If I would get a similar response from Sony, Paramount, or Disney. You would think Gnomon could tell if these discs are counterfeit if I sent them in, but apparently not, since they would not even entertain the notion.

Well bravo to Mr. Champion for creating a superior work that has stuck with me over time and that I truly feel deserved better treatment than this.",1472947200,,1014,4.253886010362694
