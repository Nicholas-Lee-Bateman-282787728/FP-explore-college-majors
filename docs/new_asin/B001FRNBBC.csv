3588316,5,B001FRNBBC,I really enjoyed this show and am sad it is no longer on.  One season just wasn't enough.  Where are these ladies now and are they still working with families and police depts. to solve murders?,1370476800,,194,4.361111111111111
3588317,5,B001FRNBBC,Definitely recommend this to people who enjoy terrific psychic detectives helping to solve real crimes.  The only thing I would like to see is followup in regards to the capturing of the criminals within the same episode would be nice.,1367712000,,235,4.875
3588318,4,B001FRNBBC,Though physics are brought in to help the police in most cases they can't or don't solve the crime(s) and updates aren't given (thus what I have seen so far.) I think when putting together a series such as this with programs already product and shown that updates should be added after each program OR noted that the case is still cold.,1366156800,,336,4.435483870967742
3588319,5,B001FRNBBC,I found this fascinating.  It is amazing how they pick up on the facts of a case.  I think you will enoyed watcing it too.,1362355200,,122,3.84
3588320,2,B001FRNBBC,It was o.k but not as good as Sensing Murder New Zealand and Australia (which is extremely difficult to purchase copies of) as they were made better than the American series...,1362268800,2,176,4.709677419354839
3588321,5,B001FRNBBC,This series keeps me glued to the screen.  Psychics who help police solve crimes are the ones I pay most attention to. I just joined Amazon Prime and finding this on the list makes it worthwhile right from the start.,1361923200,,216,4.4
3588322,1,B001FRNBBC,"I watched episode one:  Then I searched for this case on the internet: [...]

Sometimes, I wan't to believe these people can help, but in this case the two ""psychics"" were off target enough to hamper police investigation.",1359590400,3,221,4.7894736842105265
3588323,2,B001FRNBBC,The psychics didn't really know what they were talking about. A real dissapointment. The Sensing Murder Produced by New Zealand was much better.,1326672000,,144,5.304347826086956
3588324,5,B001FRNBBC,"Pam Coronado and Laurie Campbell use their psychic abilities to help detectives solve murders.  This show is extremely well done.  The music is beautiful and haunting!  There is no need to use gory special effects although you will see blood.

The two women each work on the same case but they do it separately.  They each are given an item that the victim has worn and they get information from those items.  I really believe in that.  Of course not everyone has the gift to be able to do that.

I can't stand to watch crime dramas where they take a story from the headlines and redo it.  It's so over done and overly dramatized, but not here.  Here is sheer perfection.  The story of the woman with the swimming pool in her house who lived alone intrigues me.  I guess this is a single woman's worst nightmare come true.

I believe these two women have gifts that allow them to see what is unseen to most of us.  One nice aspect is that they sometimes do not get it 100% right and we see that being psychic is not like putting a DVD in a DVD player and playing back everything as it's happened 100% accurately.

I am also drawn to this show because the two women who are the ""stars"" are simply normal looking yet beautiful in their own way women.  Where else on television can we go to see women who look like most of us on TV?

Anyone who cares about this show or agrees with my sentiment of the way women should be portrayed on television can use the links below and let Discovery know how you feel.

3588325,5,B001FRNBBC,"See the best Psychic Detective in action!

Pam Coronado is the best Psychic Detective I've ever seen or heard about.  There were only 11 shows in the series (sad, bring back the series Discovery!) and two of the cases have been solved with arrests made.  Other cases have been solved, but, due to extenuating circumstances, no arrest can be made (ie., they are dead).",1269907200,2,367,4.703125

3588327,5,B001FRNBBC,The psychics come off as real and genuine and the show is very interesting to watch. I have watched many but this one is truly top notch. I can't believe it was only on for one season. Such a classic.,1476662400,,200,4.025

3588336,5,B001FRNBBC,"I originally bought this on DVD and notice that, at the time of this writing, this episode is missing from Amazon Instant Video:

Episode 11: DREAM HOUSE NIGHTMARE

I've noticed similar issues with other series here so advise customers to check that everything is present before buying instant videos.

This US show had 1 season (2006-2007) of 11 episodes broadcast on the Discovery Channel. There is also a long running Australia/New Zealand series of Sensing Murder but I haven't watched it.

One main purpose of programs like this is to show how police actually use psychics to help resolve cold cases. In most of these episodes, several years have passed and police are unable to solve the murders, so desperate famalies request the police to call in psychics for help.

Psychics Pam Coronado and Laurie Campbell have worked for many years assisting police with unsolved cases. They are not told any details about the crime and work separately so as not to influence each other. Sceptics claim that at most, psychics provide vague generalities and have never actually solved a case anywhere, and at worst, all of this is fraud and deception because there are usually ways they can learn details of the crimes beforehand.

I've always found paranormal phenomena interesting so like to keep an open mind. In any case, this series was well done and like many others, I would have liked it to continue beyond this 1 season.",1424563200,,1423,4.8838174273858925
3588337,3,B001FRNBBC,"Most of the episodes were okay, fairly well-covered, but some parts were noticeably less dramatic and interesting; the episode format also becomes somewhat repetitive if you watch them all at once together. Overall, the Australian series is better",1403222400,,247,5.526315789473684

3588340,5,B001FRNBBC,Very interesting and realistic. Skeptics beware...you may even like the show. Wish there were more episodes. Thank you very much.,1389830400,,129,5.5

I find this show takes a really interesting and personal approach to what IS very personal and difficult for the people left behind wondering. These people normally are dealing with cold, hard science and that can be icy. On the other hand what is seen here is not necessarily easy to take but if it helps close a case I think is brilliant.",1389225600,2,472,4.436781609195402

3588346,1,B001FRNBBC,"I read the other reviews before writing my own.  The interesting thing is the case was solved.  It would be great if the episode was amended to include the rest of the case.  The ""psychics"" were basically dead wrong, and the police were right all along.  If the detective had found the lost tip, instead of wasting time with these ""psychics"", the case might have been solved sooner.  To read about the case, just google ""Susannah Chase murder"".",1386547200,6,444,4.641025641025641

I think the exchange among the officers should be less ""dry.""  (Reason for three star rating). The show does examine the slightly different visions that sometimes happens with the two women psychics on the show. I was impressed not just with the picture of places and how the events seemed to have occurred but also the feelings of the victims of their killers.  I do believe that the show should continue.",1385337600,,542,4.614583333333333

3588351,1,B001FRNBBC,"To me, using someone's loss of a loved one to take advantage of them is pretty scummy. As far as I can tell, that is all that these ""psychics"" are doing.

In the first episode one of the ""psychics"", Coronado, guesses that the victim was stabbed. The detective says ""nope"". She explains her guess and keeps guessing. Ugh. I can only imagine how many more of those bad guesses don't make it onto the final cut.

Fortunately for the family of the victim in the first episode, Susannah Chase, the case has since been solved.

The final summation on the episode I watched was that:

1) Susannah knew her killer. Both women agreed on this and felt strongly about it.
  WRONG - This was contrary to what the police previously suspected. Susannah DID NOT know the man who was convicted of her murder. It was a random assault and murder. So, their BS input could have set police on the wrong path. Also, at least one of them (can't remember which) was sure it was a University student. Of course, that guess would have pretty good odds. But, they were wrong. He was a Chilean immigrant and not a student.

2) The killer drives a darker colored older model car.
  ACCURATE - But pretty damn GENERIC - The suspect's car was a 1979 Blue Datsun. What constitutes as darker car? Really, I'd call almost anything outside of white darker. It's not like pastel colored cars are common. The odds were really in their favor with that guess.

3) This was not a sexual assault homicide
  WRONG - It was proven to be a random sexual assault that was solved with the DNA from the rapist's semen.

4) Someone knows
  Again, technically ACCURATE, but GENERIC and wrong in the details. I watch a lot of crime shows. Someone always knows or finds out. That's how most of the cases are solved. Guessing that someone knows is pretty brilliant. If it's solved, it's almost always because someone knew. If it's never solved, there's no way to prove them wrong. They guessed there was a roommate who knew and one of them even said she could spot the guy in a line up. She described him as a nerdy male possibly with glasses. The people who ""knew"" were the attacker's sister and his girlfriend. So, neither fit the guesses.

If I'm being nice, I give them 50% accuracy. Not impressed. Sure, it might be cute as a parlor trick, but there's a bit more responsibility when you're gambling with the lives and well being of others. I'll stick to my forensics shows.",1382400000,3,2427,4.494305239179955

3588353,4,B001FRNBBC,I really enjoy watching how the psychics see and interpret things from the crimes. I only wish there was more than one season!!,1379808000,,127,4.565217391304348

Things I love about the shows themselves:
1) The theme music is rather haunting
2) Watching to see how Pam and Laurie sense the crimes
3) Learning more about intuitive investigations

Things I wished would happen:
1) I wished Discovery would greenlight a second season
2) I did some research on several of the cases, and several of the people arrested or who became a person of interest matched several of the items envisioned by the mediums.",1377388800,5,483,4.807228915662651

8302471,3,B001FRNBBC,"Let me say I'm a bit ambivalent about psychics, in general.  What they do generally can't be proven or even disproven, so it's really impossible to take sides.  However, I have seen some psychics do some amazing things.  On the show ""Paranormal Witness,"" there was a psychic who helped catch a serial killer, and her ""visions"" were, well, quite visionary.  I would highly recommend renting at least Season 3, Episode 14, entitled, ""Through the Eyes of a Killer,"" for that show.

So, a month or so ago, I purchased the full season of ""Psychic Detectives"" after watching one episode and liking it, and overall, I think that series is pretty good.  I gave it a 4-star rating with a mild recommendation, and I do think that it is better than this series.

But it's not for a lack of trying by ""Sensing Murder.""

Once again, I purchased one episode of this show -- ""Hunted in the Forest"" -- and it was pretty good.  The psychics had some very interesting insight.  The detectives who the psychics worked with were careful not to ""lead the witness"" as it were, and yet the psychics seemed to pick up on many details of a crime.  However, there is one major problem  with this show, a problem that the producers, directors, writers, and even players, just can't get around:  it appears as if these crimes never are solved.

And this is really too bad, because if the cases were solved, then we as the audience could determine how accurate the psychics' visions really are.  As it stands, all of their predictions might be right -- highly unlikely -- some of their predictions might be right -- the most likely scenario -- or none of their predictions might be right -- so unlikely we can just throw it out.  After all, even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in awhile, as they say.  But we seemingly will never know with this show, unless at least some of the crimes are eventually solved.

I'm ambivalent about psychics, and I'm ambivalent about this show, thus my score.  I'm flip-flopping whether or not I'll make that full-season purchase right now.  But I would say it's worth a peek, if you're into true crime, are open-minded about psychics, and don't really care if the crimes are ultimately solved.",1490054400,,2206,4.607692307692307
