7871241,5,6304432771,"Both the wife and the daughter enjoy watching the Good Neighbors episodes.  Me, not so much my 'cup of tea', but seeing the daughter and the wife have some great 'Mom-Daughter' time together makes it all worthwhile!",1439424000,,215,4.8108108108108105
7871242,5,6304432771,"Though showing it's age in many ways (especially Margo's fashions), this is still one of the best of the Britcoms. The entire series still delights and can many episodes send me into fits of laughter regardless of the number of times they've been viewed. This tape contains my all time favorite, Silly But It's Fun, the Christmas episode, which I watch every holiday. A comedic classic!",1060992000,4,386,4.863636363636363
7871243,5,6304432771,"This is a collection I must have! And I plan to start today! Even though I have not yet purchased the first volume of this series I already know I will charish them forever!
I recorded the original series way back in 1984 from the PBS showings and have enjoyed them ever since.  Though the recordings are showing their age, classics like this are timeless and do not grow old, they just get better!
Felicity Kendal does not seem to grow old either, she just gets better!  I wonder why?",980899200,,485,4.377777777777778
7871244,5,6304432771,"as the British. ""Spin City"" was the closest America came to this genre(Yes, Prime Minister). ""The Good Neighbors"" (first bradcast as ""The Good Life"" on BBC) was (and is) the funniest sitcom I have ever experienced. It's a little dated (clothing, etc...); but, the characters are believeable, as is the concept (being self sufficient in a HIGH class London suburb.",979344000,,363,5.066666666666666
7871245,5,6304432771,"I saw this series when it came to US TV some years ago (thank you, forever, PBS).  I loved it then.  I love it now.  I've got the whole collection, finally.  And thank god, because these seem to go in and out of stock quite rapidly.
Stars:  Tom & Barbara Good, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal - whom I worship, and Margo & Jerry Leadbetter, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington.
I also saw Felicity Kendal in a PBS replay of the BBC Shakespeare series with her starring as Viola in ""Twelfth Night"" and was so impressed that I named a daughter after her.
Felicity (and the other cast members) are believable, funny, and always in trouble, love, etc., with each other.
The setting...  Tom & Barbara move to a ritzy neighborhood and start a farm... well, more like they decide to ""live off the land.""  Try that in a swank neighborhood and I'm sure you'll end up with some of the problems they had.
Totally hysterical.  Very funny.  A must see.  Own it if you can.  Definitely for the whole family.",970099200,,1014,4.427027027027027
7871246,5,6304432771,"When I first saw the Good Life (the British name) in the 1970s as an impressionable kid, I immediately loved it. Everybody was so nice and civilized unlike the glue-sniffing, head-butting ruffians at my local Scottish comprehensive school. I was so charmed that I almost wanted to become English, middle-class, and 'awfully nice.' I also developed a raging crush on Felicity Kendall, although I have to say that Penelope Keith's snobbish Margot has now edged ahead.
This series was a product of the golden age of British TV when the BBC was more like a giant artists' collective than the faceless management bureau it has since become. The casting is incredible. The four main actors are hand-in-glove with their roles. Paul Eddington as the long-suffering but slyly rebellious Jerry is the perfect foil for Margot's innocent pomposity. Felicity Kendall's Barbara is both tomboyish and kittenish and serves as a welcome check on Richard Brier's naughty little boy act as the exuberant and mischievous Tom.
For those unfamiliar with the situation of this situation comedy, it concerns the efforts of Tom and Barbara Good to escape the 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday, suburbs-to-city commuting rat race, by starting a commune in their own garden, and the effect this has on their relationship with their very strait-laced neighbors, Jerry and Margot.
The past is a country where we used to live, and, living here in my double exile in Japan, this excellent TV series is a little too nostalgic to be a wholly unmixed pleasure.",967852800,,1517,5.072
7871247,4,6304432771,"The price is right, the deal is honest and the memories pleasant; I remember watching the episodes in Wales as a young kid, at the time. It  certainly brought back nice memories. I was surprised to see that i did not  find it so very funny! Well, it si  is not the British kind of humour I  have been developing hitherto. HOWEVER, if you are American and SCEPTICAL  about British comedy, this will definately serve you as a great  introduction. It is the only tape from my collection that my American  roommate probably enjoyed the MOST.",966470400,,537,4.53125
