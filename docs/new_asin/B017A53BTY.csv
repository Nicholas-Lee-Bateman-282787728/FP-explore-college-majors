7498090,5,B017A53BTY,Very enlightening about the differences between the two children of the the high ranking Nazi. It so incredible that the one of the sons is so aware of his fathers sins and despicable behavior. It is sickening that the other thinks his father is innocent of ordering the murder of hundreds of thousand of Jews and other members of society.,1463270400,,339,4.666666666666667

7498092,4,B017A53BTY,"What is the truth that a child can accept of a parent? Particularly a parent involved in the mass murder of millions of people. In ""What Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy"", by British lawyer Phillipe Sands, two sons of Nazi leaders explain their views of their fathers' guilt. The documentary features two men - Niklas Frank, son of Hans Frank and Horst von Wachter, son of Otto von Wachter - who are now in their mid-70's. Niklas Frank has long admitted the crimes of the ""Butcher of Poland"" and has repudiated his father's deeds. Horst von Wachter cannot admit what his father has done and seems to have spent his life looking for that piece of paper that indicates - to his satisfaction - his father's culpability. He knows awful things were done but not by his father.

Phillipe Sands spends much of the film taking the two men - both born in 1939 - to various places in Germany, Poland, and Ukraine where their fathers were Nazi officials. He and Niklas Frank try in vain to convince von Wachter of his father's actions. Maybe he didn't pull the trigger himself, but people were murdered under Otto von Wachter's  watch and with the acceptance of power comes the command responsibility.  Horst von Wachter never accepts his father's responsibility, where as Niklas Frank does. Von Wachter continues to make excuses for this father

Mostly when we look back at our parents and grandparents, we can accept that they were mortals, with the same good and bad bits that all people possess. But these two aging Germans - sons of Nazi leaders - are asked to go beyond the normal behavior and confront the evil their fathers perpetrated. One man can...the other cannot.",1459641600,11,1663,4.684931506849315
7498093,5,B017A53BTY,"Important documentary.  Very frustrating that even today confronted with the facts, Horst could not admit his father was a criminal.  This was a very well done documentary--moving at times, powerful at other times, angering still at other times.  Well done and worth watching.",1459555200,,276,5.372093023255814
7498094,4,B017A53BTY,"Two sons, of two mass murdering criminals: one who was a ""good"" and loving father, to those who identified with his Nazi beliefs was a ""good and decent person of good character""  and the other Father who cold and distant to the son he thought was a product of an affair his wife had. A son brought up by a loving Mother and Father who were very much in love with each other and even when the realities of his crime were exposed the son was so insulated by a mother who still doted on the memory of her husband, swore he had done no real wrong, a family, friends of family, supporters of Nazism reinforcing the idea of the helpless Nazi leader who was really a ""good"" person...is it any wonder he would be steeped in denial? The other was a resented neglected child by both parents really, with two parents who hated each other...who when confronted with the parents atrocities, why would he have any sense of loyalty to them? He already resented them in their treatment of him and rightfully so, his support and community was found in denouncing this Nazi criminal father of his. It was infuriating and really sickeningly sad the depth in which the one son was willing to deny his father's responsibility. There is a moment when they attend a ceremony...where I just physically felt ill at the open pride in the Nazi military. I really truly believe these two men are truly a lesson in themselves.",1457568000,4,1397,4.5
7498095,4,B017A53BTY,"It is an important film.  Coming from a 'mixed' family of German and Polish Catholics and Eastern European Jews, the film underscores, for me, deep ethno-theological tension, and how such a dangerous force is never truly buried, not in the historical record, not in one's own family legacy.  I found the scene with the honoring of Ukranian and German soldiers at a Marian shrine most unsettling.  It is my hope that this film finds its way into curriculums at secondary schools and in higher education.",1455321600,5,502,4.882352941176471

8738456,5,B017A53BTY,"Having made a study of the Holocaust and the evil people at it''s heart I found this documentary absolutely fascinating. The contrast between the two men's views of their fathers' wartime criminal activity brought home the fact that whilst Frank had no doubts and it led to a lifelong hatred of his father, the other was in denial and repeatedly tried to justify his father's behaviour. Surely history leaves no doubt so the latter was a better actor. More of this please!",1480636800,,472,4.7682926829268295

8738458,5,B017A53BTY,"Superb insight into son of has frank, and revulsion of another nazi, his son, and total inability to grapple w father's  guilt. In the end, the other man reveals his own complicity in grave guilt and echoing mass murder. That man may meet his father in hell.",1474243200,,258,4.48936170212766
8738459,3,B017A53BTY,"Great documentary that examines first hand the commercial value of the anti-German shame genre.

 It takes the two sons of executed nazi officers and films them in various historical places or public venues succesfully exploiting their personal lives and pretending it to be posteritical content.

 One comes from a broken home and holds self loathing resentment for his past, the filmmaker's preferred position of degradation.

While the other came from a loving nuclear family and views the World Wars as an overall tragedy for mankind as opposed to a righteous war of good vs evil.",1468972800,3,584,5.105263157894737
8738460,5,B017A53BTY,"This documentary about the sons of high ranking Nazis and a descendant of a Ukrainian Jew, Philippe Sands, is very well done, compelling even.  Niklas Frank accepts and condemns his Nazi father's actions many times in the course of this story.  Horst von Wachtel is unable or unwilling to see and accept his own Nazi father as someone who was responsible for the deaths of perhaps millions.  On the Wikipedia page, (which states the neutrality of the page is disputed), Wachtel's father is portrayed in a more sympathetic manner than by Niklas Frank or Philippe Sands.  In spite of all evidence presented to Wachtel, he persists in seeing his father as an optimist, someone who tried to make things better and as a decent man.  The question I would have liked to have seen Wachtel asked is if it might have been possible for his father to be all of the good things he thinks-with some people, such as his family, but to also have been someone responsible for the deaths of millions.  People are complex, I think this is certainly possible.  At the end of the war, both of these boys were only six years old.  I think Wachtel perhaps had happier memories of his father than Frank did, (he describes only one tender moment that he can remember with his father and good things about this father were not likely mentioned by his mother, as he says his parents hated each other).  Frank ends up hating his father and carrying on his person at all times a photo of his father's corpse.  With Frank, as with Wachtel, it would be interesting to know if he knows of anything good about his father.  Maybe his father was just evil through and through?  This was a very interesting film; I highly recommend it.",1466467200,,1699,4.570957095709571
8738461,5,B017A53BTY,"This was amazing!  I watched this a couple of nights ago.  Really, a Psychologist should watch this and discuss Mr. Wachter's thought process, which seems quite puzzling.

A Jewish human-rights lawyer, Philippe Sands, interviews two elderly sons of two Nazi officials.  One (Niklas Frank) completely ""owns up to"" his father's crimes, and despises his father, who was hung after conviction at Nuremberg.  The other (Horst von Wachter) will not accept that his father did what he is documented to have done (he escaped justice, and died much later).  Sands takes them both to the sites of the crimes, and to the Nuremberg courtroom and the cell in which Frank was held until his execution.  This is an amazing documentary.",1465516800,,720,5.0
8738462,5,B017A53BTY,"Two sons of fathers who were very senior in the Nazi regime accompany Philippe Sands, a Jewish English human rights attorney and professor, on a trip down one of the darkest and most brutal lanes in history-- the Holocaust.  Niklas, son of Hans Frank, ""the butcher of Poland,"" in his interviews with Sands, has come to terms with the monumentality of the crimes and reality that his father was a mass murderer. He still, for a lifetime (b. 1939), suffers from a sense of complicity.  Even standing in the sites of the horrific destruction, Horst Von Wachter, son of the monstrous Otto, is having none of it.  If you want to observe and listen to a study highest on the continuum for denial, listen to him . He has spent his lifetime (b. 1939 also) trying to prove his dad was really a good guy. Sands challenges him robustly, but he doesn't budge from his self deception. This is a very important documentary in which Sands, whose Grandfather's whole family was exterminated by the Nazis during the German occupation of Poland, comes as close to equanimity as possible, in light of his own painful personal history. The doc ends with a visit with present day Ukrainian Nazis with whom Horst seems to groove right in, particularly for their appreciation of his murdering dad. Holding these conversations at the actual locations where orders were given and events took place proves extremely powerful.",1465344000,2,1399,4.796680497925311
8738463,5,B017A53BTY,"A great movie with lots of cause for reflection.  Watched it with our 12, 14 & 16 year old kids.  Didn't expect them to stay interested for the whole film, but it caught their attention.  Everyone stayed and watched till the end.",1464652800,,229,4.404761904761905
