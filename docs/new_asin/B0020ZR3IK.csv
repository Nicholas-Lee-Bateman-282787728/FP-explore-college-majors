8348781,5,B0020ZR3IK,"If you are an ambitious discus thrower, young or old, this product is a must have. My high school throwing team would watch this movie every year before our divisional meet, and it is vastly inspiring to say the least. Although the whole film is in Swedish, there are very accurate English subtitles and the foreign language rather adds to the beauty of the film. I have heard that certain DVD players will not play this format of DVD, but I have never had that problem. This movie is fantastic, this particular version of the movie is extremely high quality, and I could not recommend this purchase enough.",1372291200,,607,4.62962962962963
8348782,4,B0020ZR3IK,"I bought this film hoping to learn more about Ricky's training techniques, after seeing clips on YouTube. Unfortunately, there is little of interest to a non-discuss thrower outside of what can be found on YouTube. All the same, it is a very good film, and Ricky Bruch's story here is both sad and joyous. It is unfortunately that this is not a Region 1 or Region free disc (although it did play just fine on my computer) so you'll have to jump through hoops to get it to play for you. The movie is a slower paced film, very European in its emphasis on a slower pace and just showing scenes of not much happening. It will feel like useless filler to some, but if you appreciate that style it is quite nice.
