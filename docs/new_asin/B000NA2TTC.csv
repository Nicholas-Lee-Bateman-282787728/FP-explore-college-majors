2764016,5,B000NA2TTC,"I have seen each of these episodes and TiVo'd them since this show's debut.  This has to be one of the best-ever military aviation programs to hit the airwaves.  The stories are riveting, most told from first-hand accounts using interviews with some of the original aces or their fellow squadron members.  There are recounts told from several military conflict eras... WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam War, Six Days War and more.  The beautifully-done CGI graphics are better than any video game created... they are exhilirating.  The usage of interactive maps, graphs and diagrams make it all much easier to comprehend - you really understand the strategy and tactics involved for all of the battles.  The SOUND is unbelievable, the narration not overdone and even the music score is extremely good for a cable show - use surround and turn it up LOUD... wow.  The whole show is woven into a tapestry of inside information, education and wholesome solid entertainment.  It's so good, you almost forget you are watching a history program.  I have all of these on DVD recorded from my TiVo, but this is so good and rewatchable, I will most likely purchase this set.  I highly recommend this to any aviation fan or miltary buff, even the casual ones (such as myself) - or even for those slightly curious about the subject.  Even gamers will enjoy this series as the reenactments feel like playing a high-end video game or combat flight simulator.  My 10 year-old son watches these with me, glued to the tv and never gets fidgety or bored... that should tell you a lot.  I am so happy these have been released in such a nice set... thanks, A&E and History Channel.  Major kudos!",1175385600,14,1672,4.760416666666667

2764028,5,B000NA2TTC,Sadly I met one of these great pilots in the last days of his life but I never knew that African American men flew and fought in world war 2. It's a part of history not taught in all highschool or college classes so I orderd this set to learn more I was not disappointed this is real and wonderful history,1392249600,,305,4.016393442622951

2764031,5,B000NA2TTC,"Quality of the CGI is incredible.  History lessons are very interesting.  Interviews with the pilots generate awe when you think about the lives of many people who are given hero status.  These amazing people risked life and death at every turn. The narration is outstanding and you will understand not only the fast-paced, life and death situations, but the underlying historical significance of the battles.

2764036,5,B000NA2TTC,"Season One of Dogfights featured on the History Channel is an excellent, exciting and informative series of videos on military aviation spanning almost one hundred years.  As a pilot, the features presented are of special interes to me.  I have never been disappointed by items purchased through Amazon.  Ease of use and quick response is the outstanding characteristic of services at Amazon.  This is in contrast with other online buying systems like Ebay (although a different philosophy) and their cohort in crime these days, Paypal, who should be investigated for their unwarrented holding of money on items sold (up to 21 days). Even banks don't do that.  Thanks again for your prompt and courteous attention, and your regard for the customer's opinion.  -Herb Trimpe",1331510400,,772,5.185483870967742
2764037,5,B000NA2TTC,"Superb re-enactments of battles, close attention to detail like reflections in the glass of the cockpit,
rivets in the cockpit, shadows from the sun on the planes. Pilot, Rio and Wizzo interviews and commentary
along with good narration. You will want to view these discs more than once. If you are an aviation fan you've got to have this to add to your collection, It's worth every penny. This review also describes season #2 !!!!!",1311465600,,432,4.773333333333333
2764038,4,B000NA2TTC,"Fantastic show.  Since you can see the fight from every angle, it really lets you watch the show.  It is computer generated, which makes it feel a little cartoony, but coupled with the fact that it is from the fighters viewpoints, it is riveting.  I've watched every one at least 2 times.  It perfectly portrays the bravery and tenacity of the fighters that achieved air supremacy during several eras of air combat.  From a breakdown of tactics to a show of shear determination, I find it stunning.

That being said, I have NEVER been a fan of aviation.  My father is a pilot, but I've never cared.  It wasn't until seeing what the war pilots went through that I started to appreciate it as a whole.  If you are a war buff (which I HAVE always been), you should try at least one episode to see if it's for you.

It does seem to feel like it is ONLY American and Israeli fighters, but I'm hoping for more.  Come on spitfires!!",1309737600,,925,4.350877192982456
2764039,5,B000NA2TTC,"I have been studying WWII fervently for the past 3 years.  I have seen lots of DVDs on it.  Dogfights has material for WWII up through the present era.  Each episode gives you the history of what led up to the event, all the circumstances, etc.  I was looking again at the aircraft carrier Enterprise last night.  As much as I already knew about it I still found things I had overlooked.  I love the format: you see actual combat footage, you hear first hand accounts of veterans that were there and the graphics are just great.  They tie the whole ball of wax up and by the end of the episode you knew just what happened at the battle. I didn't buy this set until recently as I watched it on the History channel, but it is just a must if you want to better understand WWII history especially. I got my money's worth out of just one DVD and you get 7 in this series....great buy, better education.",1307577600,,897,4.241176470588235
2764040,5,B000NA2TTC,"I loved watching this series!  The two things that I like most are the way the dueling flight paths are clearly and graphically illustrated, as well as the way we are put back into viewing from the cockpit.  The narrator's voice and the interviews with those who fought the fights are also of great appeal.  I'm two or three years behind on the technology, but have not had any formatting issues on the DVD player that I bought at a local discount store about 5 years ago.  I will be looking to obtain more of the Dogfight series, and probably pass them along to my father--if he hasn't already watched them!",1304726400,,608,4.45045045045045
2764041,4,B000NA2TTC,"I will keep it short, because a lot of good reviews have been written on this already. It's a great show and well worth the money. I give it four stars instead of five, though, for the following reasons:
1. The video ought to be in wide screen format in this day and age. It is not, and this makes the show look dated already.
2. The Spitfire and the Hurricane, two of the most decisive and well-known air planes of World War 2, are not mentioned at all. This I find rather strange.
3. The Hawker Siddeley Harrier is also not mentioned, despite it being one of the most famous air planes of the eighties because of the Falklands War and it's ability to land vertically, etc. This I also find very strange.

Anyway, it is a good show, and I hope they will make a third season and include the mentioned air planes. There is a limit to how many episodes about the F-4 Phantom and the Wildcat I can take in the long run :)",1273968000,,918,4.157303370786517
2764042,1,B000NA2TTC,"I'll save space and say that I agree with the other posts that laud the show for it's quality and usefulness.

Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap, direct-to-video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.

Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century.

I would give the show five stars, but to balance all the five star reviews of the show that ignore the quality of the DVDs, I'm giving it one star.",1260489600,8,1075,4.469387755102041
2764043,5,B000NA2TTC,"This four dvd set has some really beautiful highlights.  The CGI is fabulous.  The resulting episodes are visually arresting - much more lifelike than actual combat footage, which tends to be grainy or washed out.  The CGI is so accurate that even the reflections on the fuselage of each aircraft follow the sun as the pilots maintain an orbit above or around a target, or pursue their enemy.  The sequences of aerial combat are very fluid and very close to the sort of dogfight scenarios that one might visualize without having had the actual experience of air combat.

""Long Odds"", a WWII segment that features ""Old 666"", a B-17 outfitted with thirteen .50 calibre machine guns and heavier armament.  That Flying Fortress was tasked with the reconnaissance of Japanese troop movements over various land locations.  Old 666 was  involved in a 45-minute dogfight, facing an overwhelming Japanese presence.  Its pilot, Jay Zeamer won the Medal of Honor for his heroism.  Ultimately, the crew of Old 666 became the most Highly decorated B-17 crew of WWII.  A great story.

 ""The Hunt for the Bismark""  and ""Death of the Japanese Navy"" depict WWII aerial engagements involving naval vessels. The latter episode is a CGI adaptation of the actions surrounding Taffy III, and how that task force, which was cut off from the rest of the US Pacific fleet for a few days, managed to inflict serious damage on Japanese naval forces in the straights of the Phillipine islands.

""MIG Alley"" illustrates the leap in jet technology during the Koean War and the effect it had on aerial combat and the resulting high speed problems each pilot faced are explained in surprising detail.  Ace Pilots Frederick ""Boots"" Blesse, Robbie Risner and Ralph Parr give great commentary.

""Air Ambush"" with commentary by by legendary Air Force Ace Robin Olds depicts the F4 Phantom and a rather unusual mission assigned to their Pilots and Radar Intercept Officers. It's difficult to imagine to be at the top front of all that raw power. This episode has a brief flashback - sort of a story within a story - to his days as a P-38 combat pilot in the skies over western Europe during World War II.  ""Hell Over Hanoi"" is also about the F4 Phantom over Vietnam, with narration by Fred Olmsted and Dan Cherry.  Again, Great CGI.

As a bonus on disc one, ""One Inch from Out of Control,""  features commentary by Willie ""Irish"" Driscoll and Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham and is simply put, amazing.  At the controls of the USS Constallation's VF-96 ""Showtime 100,"" the Pilot and RIO score three MIG kills and escape a Surface to Air Missile hit which tears their Phantom apart and with only nanoseconds to spare, eject into the waters of the south China Sea.

There isn't much about World War I, but the series' introductory episode feautres a segment devoted to Eddie Rickenbacker and the techniques of aerial combat that he and other notables such as Manfred Von Richtoffen helped to develop and are still studied by combat pilots today.

To its credit, the History Channel also put together a CGI series that dealt more with ground combat in World War II, but the CGI didn't work all that well.  Even though the historical information was accurately depicted, the CGI wasn't nearly what it should have been mostly by virtue of the complicated nature of recreating computer-generated human beings.  In other words, the soldiers didn't look real.

""Dogfights"" Seasons One is a four dvd set that I highly recommend.  Devotees of air combat will find themselves watching many of these episodes several times to get all of the nuance of the air engagements depicted on these dvds.",1236988800,,3636,4.839805825242719
2764044,5,B000NA2TTC,"'Dogfights, season 1' is a very good animated documentary on air battles of WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam War and the Israeli Six Day War. I enjoy sticking a CD in and reliving the air battles that turned the tide of war.
With interviews from pilots themselves. It even has a battleship vs. battleship and aircraft carrier battle, ('Death of the Japanese Navy'), and an airplane vs. battleship battle, ('Hunt for the Bismarck'). I also have season 2, and am waiting for season 3.

2764045,5,B000NA2TTC,This DVD set was bought for my boyfriend who is in the military and had seen the show on TV. He talked about it all the time. Now that he has it he raves about it even more. He couldn't be any happier. He say's it's one of the best military documentary videos he's seen. I even enjoy watching it because it explains and shows diagrams very well so even I understand what they are talking about. He can't wait to purchase season 2. Thanks so much!,1231200000,,446,4.137931034482759
2764046,5,B000NA2TTC,"This series of videos is great, now i just have to get season 2, The sound quality is just as good as on TV, and likewise for the picture quality. I'm glad i got this, because not only can you see the entire season 1, but in this they include bonus ""dogfights"", some of which were not shown on TV before this came out on DVD, so this is worth the money if you are interested in dogfighting, and WW1 and WW2 era aircraft.",1227571200,,420,4.011904761904762
2764047,5,B000NA2TTC,"Fabulously produced series.  Great Value for Money.  Worth every valuable cent you can find these days.

Kudos to the team.  Highlight for me was interviews with the pilots and aces ...  the Israeli - Jordanian dog fight was a classic - the pilot acknowledging that (and, I am paraphrasing here) .. ""even though we are sworn enemies, as pilot to pilot, I really wished he had lived"".

I was never  into battles etc, but this is a must see.  Warning :: It's highly addictive !

Very inexpensive for what it offers.

SUGGESTION :: I bought Dogfights Vol 1 and Vol 2 and saved a bunch of money :) Don't buy them together -- buy them separately.  And with free shipping, you've got yourself a deal !",1225584000,,695,4.436507936507937
2764048,5,B000NA2TTC,"I caught the original ""pilot"" for this show on the History Channel in Fall of 2006 and absolutely loved it. Apparently I wasn't alone as many other viewers were so impressed that the History Channel made it into a full-fledged series. I have an intense love of military aircraft, and in particular anything having to do with WW2 air combat. In high school my friends had posters of their favorite bands hanging on the walls. I had posters of B-17's and Ju-87 Stukas. This, coupled with a sizable collection of flight sims and plastic aircraft models makes me a prime audience target for this program.

Dogfights uses state of the art CG graphics to recreate some of the great dogfights in history, covering all eras from WW1 up to the Gulf War. There seems to be a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and WW2 era dogfights in particular, and that may irk some folks, but really this is where the vast majority of such action took place and the show reflects this. In addition to this are two episodes largely relating to sea battles, specifically the hunt for the German battleship Bismarck, and the fantastic episode on Taffy 3 (a handful of US Destroyers and Destroyer Escorts taking on a greater force of Japanese cruisers and battleships, including the Yamato, and *winning*). Honorable mention goes to the episode on the Cactus Air Force flying F4F Wildcats, and the awesome episode ""Long Odds"" featuring extremely mismatched dogfights between Swede Vejtasa in an SBD facing off against 3 Japanese Zeroes, a very unique tale about a B-17 named ""Ol' 666"", and a dogfight between Mig-17's and the venerable F-105 ""Thud"".

The program typically covers certain pilots' exploits. These pilots are interviewed throughout the show describing how the dogfight unfolded, as well as interviews with flight instructors and historians. Starting forces are shown as well as side by side comparisons of the aircraft involved, marking their strengths and weaknesses. The WW2 episodes appear to be primarily based in the Pacific Theater, and the only WW1 episode is more or less of a portion of the series pilot. This too may get under some folks' skin, but I love this show in any way I can get it and I think it's safe to say most of the other posters here agree.

There is some controversy surrounding the show's noticeable highlighting of US and Israeli pilots. In truth I think the show would gain much by doing a 2 hour special on the Battle of Britain, but remember that this show was primarily intended for a US audience and thus the producers were trying to cater to this demographic. There were some episodes done from the Japanese and German perspectives in Season 2, but not much else, and as I said this will irk a few folks. There's a number of things I'd love to see the show do programs on;

-The aforementioned Battle of Britain
-Pearl Harbor
-Anything on the WW2 Russian Front (who doesn't want to see some I-16's zipping around?)
-The Nigerian Civil War where the newborn nation of Biafra's tiny mercenary air force took the larger nation's modernized Air Force to task using homemade fighter planes
-A whole episode on Hans-Ulrich Rudel's exploits in his famed Stuka (there's enough there to do a 2 hour special, at the very least!).

There's some uncertainty about the future of the show and rumors of cancellation, which makes a number of us fans a little bit uneasy. There's practically nowhere else we can go to get this kind of programming and that worries me and a lot of others. The bottom line though is that you cannot find a better program of this type anywhere and cannot recommend buying this series on DVD enough. You will not be disappointed!",1224979200,,3655,4.749606299212599
2764049,4,B000NA2TTC,"I really enjoyed this program when I saw it on the History Channel, and was very excited to be able to get it through Amazon. It's really great how they used first hand descriptions from the pilots that flew the planes and the missions, and re-enacted the dogfights with computer animation so that you could see what the pilots were describing. It also gave great detail about the planes and their strengths and weaknesses. The only downside was that even though the commercials were edited out, there was still the annoying ritual that is on all History Channel documentaries, where they back up to re-tell half the story after each commercial. This tends to be a bit annoying since there are no commercials, so no reason to review the story. But it's still a great documentary and very interesting in spite of that one small situation.",1220832000,,837,4.739726027397261
2764050,4,B000NA2TTC,"I agree with a previous reviewer that probably the strongest plus in the Dogfights series are the interviews with the pilots. WWII history is about to pass from the realm of ""living history"", as most of the heroes who fought that war are dead. These interviews help ensure that the stories will be there to enthrall the next generation - assuming that the school systems will allow the stories to be told (but that's another soapbox and not appropriate for this venue).

I love the series; and have watched the episodes over & over - especially the one about the Battle of Leyte Gulf with Taffy 3. The only negative comments I would make from a technical standpoint (and these are not deal-breakers) are these. First, the rocking effect that happens every time a plane flys by is cool at first; but, repeated watchings of the episodes find that the effect starts to become annoying. I could do with the effect happening maybe once per episode, maximum.

The other thing that gets redundant is they show the same plane getting shot down 3-4 times, from different angles. I don't have a problem with seeing the event once from the attacker's cockpit & once from the recipient's vantage point. But, any more times is too repetitive.

As I said before, neither of these things are serious faults; and I'm certainly not suggesting that anyone not purchase the series. The special effects are amazing, and the subject matter is engaging. I'm always on the edge of my seat when I watch an episode, even though I may have seen it 10 times.",1215475200,,1531,4.662962962962963
2764051,1,B000NA2TTC,"I've collected historical and military documentaries for over 40 years and this is without a doubt the worst fake historical-documentary series that is in fact propaganda that I've seen in English. Worse, it is the ONLY series I've seen in ANY language that not only omits the 'Battle of Britain' and Spitfire, but shows such a one-sided, American/Israeli-biased series. If the RAF is mentioned it is to prove how great Americans & Israelis were in comparison to them.
If there was fuel to the rising criticism of the owners of the History channels recently producing unprofessional and unethical propaganda programming, this is it.
This is the only series I wouldn't even accept as a gift to be beer coasters.",1213747200,13,710,4.974789915966387
2764052,5,B000NA2TTC,"This series is so well done, you can't stopping watching until it's it over, so be in sure and taking care of any thing else before you push play. It also has a plus for me, as they detail the movements so well, I've done much better when flying simitation (IL2 1946) and I can transfer the moves directly to the simulation and usually come out better than I used to do. I intend to purchase all the seasons and I highly recommend you do too, for those times when you have all the cable channels on and nothing worth watching.",1209772800,2,526,4.217821782178218
2764053,4,B000NA2TTC,"Having seen ""Dogfights of the Middle East"" over the x-mas period, I rushed to purchase this dvd set when I returned from holiday.

The graphics used to recreate the air battles are amazing and the quality of the aircraft is at times decievingly real. This coupled with the narrators tone and historical detail make for a thrilling dvd set.

I only have two complants. 1. There is too much WWII stuff (but Im biased more towards modern jets) and 2. Alot of details are repeated as is standard in most US tv documentaries (due to recaps after every ad break)

Overall this series is informative, thrilling and highly recommended. I look forward to season 2 being released.",1205107200,,670,4.7094017094017095

2764059,5,B000NA2TTC,"If you've ever wondered what it's like to experience the harrowing, dizzying heights (and pulse-pounding depths) of aerial combat but haven't strapped yourself into a combat aircraft, this is your chance. From WWI through the Kosovo Campaign, this series does just that. With graphics that rival the best of computer flight sims and narration that sets up each engagement, Dogfights takes you on the best of couch-borne joyrides. You'll probably even find yourself telling your workmates about one engagement or two you've seen, because some of them are almost too unbelievable to be true! Ever seen a B-17 -- flying solo on a reconnaissance mission in the Pacific but loaded to the gills with machine guns -- dogfight with a swarm of about 17 Japanese fighters, yet somehow make it through alive? You will in this series. Each show includes a 'You Are There'-style narrative, yet seamlessly includes interviews with some of the pilots involved and presents a brilliant setup of each situation. The shows are so well-done you'll probably find yourself watching them over and over again -- the perfect reason to buy them on DVD.",1196380800,,1127,5.032085561497326
2764060,5,B000NA2TTC,"I bought Dogfights for my 3 grandsons ages 3 to 10 and they are absolutely glued to the TV when it's on. Their father and grandfather are right there with them too, not to mention my daughter and myself as well. The graphics and the stories are unlike anything you hear today. WWII vets are a dying breed and such a breed apart that it's inspiring to hear them tell their great stories of heroism, danger and tragedy. I love for my grandsons to understand a world that had men that were full of honor and self-sacrifice rather than a world of tattooed dope-head ego-maniac rock stars who simply follow a herd of pathetic self-serving fools.

Love this DVD.",1193443200,2,656,4.512605042016807

2764063,5,B000NA2TTC,"Before this series, you'd hear accounts about aerial battles and on occassion, receive short footage about those battles when viewing series such as ""The Century of Warfare"".

However, this series gives you in depth coverage with excellent computer animated graphics step by step with some of the fiercest, most savage aerial battles that we wouldn't even know of if it wasn't for this series.

I agree, not much WWII coverage is on here, but I think the series did great by incorporating different planes/aerial battles from various wars fought throughout the century.  There are 2 benefits to this:
- Witnessing the evolution of the fighter plane across the decades
- Observing how war, especially the aerial battle, has changed thru the century to press the need for better, more sophisticated fighter planes.

The episodes are generally 45 minutes each.  There is one episode that's about 1 1/2 hours long (Dogfights: The greatest air battles which is a bonus for disc 1).  Here are the pros and cons:

PROS:
- Detailed descriptions from the fighter pilots themselves across Asia, Europe, and the Mid East
- Excellent computer generated graphics
- Great comparisons/stat sheets of the planes compared side by side as well as some of the armaments of each
- Solid descriptions about aerial maneuvers and what real dogfighting is all about

CONS:
- There's a series in Season 2, the ""First Dogfighters"" that I felt should have been the pilot for Season 1 as it covers info about biplanes, the first planes that paved the way for dogfighting.

Although I am not a member of the US Military, I do consider myself a history buff having collections such as Century of Warfare, 20th Century Battlefields, Decisive Battles, Battlefields (Polygram, PBS), and The World at War.  Dogfights in itself is an excellent portrayal of what pilots had to endure during their time.  This series will leave you hanging on the edge of your ""cockpit"" at home.  Also, the 2nd season looks just as interesting if not better.  Just check out the episodes coming up:

2764071,5,B000NA2TTC,"One word to describe the series? AWESOME.  A very imaginative and visually engaging approach to dogfight documentary: use computer graphics to show the position of dogfighting aircraft in relation to each other, show possible maneuvers and outcomes, and annotate it with a running commentary from the aces themselves as they relive their encounters, and you have a very excellent and thrilling program that is as educational as it is entertaining.  All the Episodes are excellent- but I am haunted in particular by the final image of the Japanese battleship Yamato capsizing and exploding in a towering mushroom cloud image that instantly reminds one of Japan's fate at the end of WWII.  Powerful imagery- as powerful in its anti-war message as the the emotionally devastating ending of the German submarine film DAS BOOT (THE BOAT), distilled and compressed into a harrowing and unforgettable single image..

I have a question for those of you familiar with the series and the History Channel- I vaguely remember an episode featuring the P-38 Lightning dogfighting in Europe and having to overcome compressibility problems while diving and engaging foes.  Was this episode part of DOGFIGHTS, or was it a separate program?  It had the same trademark CG and presentation as the DOGFIGHTS series, but when I watched Season One I can't seem to find any trace of it.  The Lightning was my favorite aircraft as a child growing up and I have always been fascinated by it- has anyone seen this program featuring the Lightning on the History Channel?  I do not think it is the documentary that was devoted to the Lightning that featured Charles Lindbergh, as it did not have any CG in its content.  Anyone out there familiar with this?",1180656000,4,1727,4.989547038327526
2764072,5,B000NA2TTC,"Loved the show, particularly the disemination of tactics, the interviews of the actual pilots and the computer animation all come together to make this programme very watchable even to those not really interested in military aviation.",1180224000,2,234,5.527777777777778

2764074,5,B000NA2TTC,"The History Channel's DOGFIGHTS is an outstanding action documentary series that masterfully and excitingly puts you in the cockpit to examine the evolution of air warfare. The computer effects are astonishingly ""photo realistic"" and simply amazing at keeping one riveted to a ""documentary."" I especially appreciate how each story's historical relevance is revealed and the series is packed with a lot more than just airplane and jet specifications. I have learned a great deal about our Country's major conflicts and the sacrifices of people far better than me. You will be moved by the excellent interviews with the American Heroes that were there and the perspective of their modern pilot/aviator counterparts. I share the quibble of the previous reviewer about the wide screen image not being enhanced for wide screen TVs, but am especially disappointed that no provision for subtitling or closed captioning was made. If only the DVD mastering reflected the care the filmmakers took in this project.",1177632000,5,1003,5.314465408805032
2764075,5,B000NA2TTC,"The History Channel's ""Dogfights"" series is a huge step forward for air combat documentaries. Rarely can gun camera footage capture what actually happened in a dogfight. Instead you just see the final couple seconds before the target explodes. The ""Dogfights"" episodes overcome this limitation by adding in computer-generated reenactments of the air battles that make you feel like you are there watching it all unfold right in front of you. You come away with a much better appreciation of the tactics. For archival footage fans, don't worry--there is still plenty of that in these programs. But because they also have the vivid computer imagery, the episodes don't have to rely on showing the same stock footage over and over and over. I especially appreciated this for the jet era battles, where there is generally a short supply of good footage. In particular, I thought the ""Mig Alley"" episode was a tremendous improvement over previous pre-CGI documentaries about the air war in Korea. And in that episode, the reenactment of Robby Risner's epic mission is the most incredible air battle story I have ever seen.

The whole series is amazing. It is absolutely essential viewing for anyone interested in air combat. That said, let me also offer three minor warnings:

1. Air battles in Europe during World War 2 get surprisingly little coverage in Season 1--only a episode of ""Greatest Air Battles"" bonus episode and a flashback in the ""Air Ambush"" episode about Robin Olds. Likewise, World War I air combat is not covered except at the beginning of the ""Greatest Air Battles"" episode.

2. There is a glitch on the ""Greatest Air Battles"" episode. When I hit 'play all' or 'introduction' for that episode, it starts with Rickenbacker's mission. It seems like the logical starting point, but that isn't actually the start of the episode. There is a lot of interesting material before that, but you have to manually rewind in order to get the real beginning of the episode.

3. When last I checked, you could get ""Dogfights"" for much less money from Deep Discount.

Finally, if you want to learn more about the dogfights of World War 2, I strongly recommend VICTORY ROLL by William Wolf. This massive book (460+ pages with over 600 photos) is the most comprehensive history of all the US aces from World War 2 that I have ever encountered.",1176940800,42,2340,4.898989898989899
2764076,5,B000NA2TTC,"First of all, you may wonder how I can say that this show is even better on DVD when it supposedly doesn't street for another 2 weeks as of this writing.  Well, DeepDiscount already shipped out its copies 2 weeks ahead of schedule, if 24 April is indeed the street date.

Anyways, so if you've seen this show on the History Channel, you already know the quality of the show.  Using state-of-the-art ""computer game"" style type graphics, and first-hand accounts from the veterans themselves, ""Dogfights"" chronicles some of the 20th Century's most famous (and infamous) dogfight engagements from WWI thru Vietnam and the 6-Day War.

The 3D models they use for the aircraft are some of the best I've seen outside a Hollywood feature film effects studio.  They are highly detailed and use historically accurate paint schemes and markings.  They even show the pilots in the planes themselves.  The special effects used during the combat footage is also top notch, from the tracers, to the fire/smoke/explosions, to the pieces falling off the planes as they're shot.

The series was filmed in widescreen, but unfortunately, the widescreen transfers are not anamorphic.  So we're talking just letterboxed 4:3 transfers.  But the transfer is still very good despite being non-16:9 enhanced.  The double length ""bonus"" pilot that was actually done a year before the series started is done in 4:3 so no worries there with regards to image quality.

The sound is also good despite only being in Dolby 2.0 surround.  Just jack up the volume and set your receiver to 5-channel stereo (if available) and let'em rip and roar!  The only con I have about the mix is that there's a low music track playing over the CG dogfight scenes which sometimes drowns out the sound effects, but still, it's a great sound track for just a 2.0 track.

This series brought in a lot of new fans of the History Channel it seems as this series is that well done.  I'm hoping that the series continues later this year.  I can't wait to see what other dogfighting areas they go into.  I'm guessing some episodes on the Battles of Britain, Pearl Harbor, Midway, Coral Sea, Marianna's Turkey Shoot, and even some Eastern Front encounters.  Hell, there's still probably several European engagements they could cover.  Like the 8th Air Force's daylight bombing raids over Europe, once of course they got fighter cover with the P-47s and P-38s, and then the P-51s.  And surely they'll touch more on some WWI engagments with the Red Baron and his Flying Circus.",1176249600,20,2517,4.86150234741784

Kudos to the people who had the forethought to get legends like Robin Olds, Robbie Risner, Swede Vejtasa, and countless others to tell their stories in their own words while they were still around.  I teach middle school science, and I have the privilege of taking my classes on a field trip to the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, FL, every year.  I show my students a couple of these episodes prior to the trip, as they're not only loaded with history, but they contain a tremendous amount of science concepts as well.  One of the F-4s featured in the episode ""MiG Killers of Midway"" is on display there.  Yeah, it's weird to many, but it's not every day you get to see an aircraft on display that can claim a MiG kill.
