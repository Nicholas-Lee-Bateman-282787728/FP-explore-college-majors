772221,3,6304056842,"""The Quatermass Xperiment""(1956) is another of those early ""Atomic Age"" films that questions the wisdom of allowing scientists free rein to unlock secrets that might ultimately harm the world. Its premise is much like that of ""The Thing from Another World "" with an alien attempting to reproduce and take over the earth. In both films science is shown as reckless about the long-term consequences of its experiments.

An experimental rocket built by Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) is brought back from space by remote control after contact is lost with the three crewmen. When Quartermass and his assistant enter the rocket they find just one of the crew, all that remains of the other two crewmen are two very silly looking space suits.

Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth), the surviving crewman, is very sick and cannot provide any useful information. Fortunately a camera on board the rocket has recorded a strange phenomenon. This and a strange residue inside the ship provide some clues about what happened during the flight. Meanwhile Carroon's condition worsens until he eventually escapes from the hospital and goes on a rampage.

There is one great scene where the conflicted Carroon rips the head off a little girl's doll, he walks away and they cut to a wide shot of the shocked girl holding the broken doll.  The girl is played by Jane Asher who would be the inspirational muse for many of the Beatles' songs in the 60's.

""The Quatermass Xperiment"" was quite popular at the time of its release. The premise is interesting and Wordsworth is very good in what is almost a non-speaking role. But don't expect anything elaborate like ""Forbidden Planet"", ""Destination Moon"" or even ""Them"". The budget limitations are compounded by the absence of a resourceful production design staff. So the sets look bad even by low budget standards.

Fortunately things are so bad that it provides the same campy amusement value found in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". The radio station set is a folding table with a microphone and features the same wall sconces found in several other the film's interior sets. It will remind you of Ed Wood's airplane cockpit.

The rocket ship is as lame as the one featured in ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" (itself a satire of movies like ""The Quatermass Xperiment""). The space suits are identical to the uniforms worn by the Sheriff of Nottingham's men on 1950's ""Robin Hood"" television show.

Perhaps most amusing is the early VW bus driven by the Quatermass group to the crash site. Once parked they open up the rear engine compartment to reveal a radio and remote control system that looks suspiciously like a VW engine with a couple knobs and gauges added to the outside. This actually fooled people in 1956 because a rear engine vehicle was unknown to most of the viewers.

Fans of campy 1950's sci-fi and horror should find ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" both entertaining and amusing.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1146355200,4,2977,4.912350597609562
772222,4,6304056842,"In this early black and white effort from Hammer, we see a spaceship on its return to Earth. Three men had left on the voyage, but only one is inside when the rocket lands. One man, and a strange, fungus-like residue that may be the remains of the other astronauts.

As the poor survivor starts to mutate, we watch lead scientist Brian Donleavy coldly and remorselessly attempt to solve the problem. Perhaps, considering it was the Cold War, we expected characters to be as hard hearted as Quatermass. On watching the movie now, however, you'll find yourself asking the question ""Who was really the monster?"". Was it the poor mutating astronaut, or Quatermass?

Donleavy's last line can still send a chill down your back.",1136160000,3,721,4.806451612903226
772223,1,6304056842,"I first saw Quartermass and the Pit many years ago and have re-watched it several times since, enjoying it thoroughly. I was unaware that it was part of a series, so when I discovered the Quartermass Xperiment I was excited and expecting another great sci-fi. However I was disappointed. Shot on a very low budget, the Xperiment does not compare with it's successor the Pit. Donlevey's charactor shows no intelligence, scietific or otherwise. Through out the movie I found myself constantly asking time and again, why is his charactor doing this or why isn't he doing that - he's supposed to be a sceintist. Which I guess is what my disappointment with the movie boild down to - the ""science"" is missing from the ""fiction"". Additionally, I felt that the plot was thin. Purpose and motive were missing through out. I love and have been collecting movies for over 25 years and have more than 3000 on VHS and DVD in my personal collection. Sadly I can't find anything worth recommending about this one. If you want Quartermass don't Xperiment, get in the Pit.",1136073600,3,1056,4.744565217391305
772224,5,6304056842,"""The Quatermass Xperiment"" (1955 - 82 minutes), suspense movie of scientific fiction written by Nigel Kneale, Richard Landau and Val Guest and directed by Val Guest, is derived from the television series ""Quatermass Xperiment"". With six episodes of 30 minutes, it was broadcasted in 1953 and immediately established. This film, photographed in black & white, preserved the quality of the original series and became the first international success of the Hammer Film, the creative English independent producer. The plot tells the story of professor Bernard Quatermass, the man who sent into space the first manned British rocket, and his investigations about the disappearance of two astronauts in its return. Victor Carroon, the only surviving astronaut, was affected by an enigmatic alien organism that caused mysterious alterations in his body, and was slowly possessed by the powerful extraterrestrial force. Transformed into a gigantic hybrid vegetal/animal monster, Carroon was used as a nasty way of Earth invasion and was finally electrocuted in the Abbey of Westminster during a live television transmission.

It's interesting to note that due to the success of this film and the two subsequent productions [""X-The Unknown"" and ""Quatermass II - Enemy from Space""], the Hammer received the necessary impulse and subsidies to produce the terror movies that made it world-wide famous. Don't miss the opportunity to watch this amazing movie.",1095638400,11,1445,5.509009009009009
772225,4,6304056842,"Fans of Doctor Who, Blake 7, and later BBC ventures will love this older U.K. science fiction.  Unfortunately the British were not very good about recording their television programs, or keeping the tapes afterwards, and thus we will not be seeing the televised original for this story.  The original live six-part 1953 TV production went some 200 minutes.  The Quatermass author, Nigel Kneale, was not too happy about the new version's reduction to 82 minutes.  Most who saw the TV version thought that it was superior to the movie.
Kneale wrote a number of TV programs that were eventually adapted to film.  However, he will always remain famous for Quatermass.  The movies would parallel a series of TV productions:  Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958-9).  Kneale would conclude the series with Quatermass/The Quatermass Conclusion (1979).
The UK theatrical remake of The Quatermass Experiment (1955) was directed by Val Guest and the screenplay was written by Val Guest and Richard Landau.  The part of Professor Bernard Quatermass was played by Brian Donlevy.  Donlevy was chosen because it was thought an American in the role would give the film more box office appeal in the U.S.  However, in hindsight, it was a little like giving the role of Doctor Who to an obvious Texan or person from the Bronx.  Sometimes accents are important.  Donlevy did a professional job, although a few cast members complained that he had a drinking problem.
The experimental rocket Q1 crashes in England. Quatermass, the somewhat reckless creator of the ship races to the site.  Only one of the three astronauts is found alive, Victor Carroon (played by Richard Wordsworth).  The other men have vanished.
This mystery drives the first part of the film.  Later it becomes clear that Carroon is not only sick but dangerous.  Something has come back with him, something that absorbs the flesh of living creatures and appropriates it into itself.  The second half of this film is a somewhat typical man turned into monster drama.
It grows and goes on a rampage of destruction.  Can it be caught?  How will they stop it?
This early Hammer Film, and their first international success, was filmed in black-and-white.  While the film has been released as one of MGM's Midnight Movies, it is only available on VHS.  This is quite unfortunate given the fact that the later films are available on DVD.  However, the transfer to video is excellent.
Would you believe that this film was given a British ""X"" rating certificate?  There are no sexual situations, no romance, and no nudity.  The language is fairly tame.  Even the supposedly horrific scenes of mayhem from the monster are a mild PG by today's standards.
While it lacks some of the intensity of the later films, it is a good story.  I would recommend it for fans of science fiction, British or not.",1040428800,67,2854,4.903966597077244

The supporting characters are good as well, but the mainstay of the movie is the strong story line which flows from event to event almost flawlessly.

Although Donlevy's performance is a little stiff,Margia Deans is dire,and her voice on this edition has been dubbed,probably to make her seem less automaton like,but I believe it is Richard Wordsworth's performance that truelly delivers the goods,truelly a classic of it's day,shame a DVD hasn't been announced of the movie,come along MGM how about it?",982022400,5,660,5.346153846153846
772228,4,6304056842,"There's simply no equal to the Quatermass films in the effects-driven ""science fiction"" foisted on today's public. These films, adapted from much longer BBC television ""miniseries"", rely on intelligent  plot development and attention to detail that is notably lacking in  anything done in the genre lately.
In this film, the first of the  series, Quatermass's experimental rocket crashes to Earth after having been  out of contact. Three people went up - but there's only one person aboard  now. The others.....? Ah, that would be telling!
Originally titled  ""The Quatermass Xperiment"", the movie played on its ""X""  rating from the (remarkably timid) British film review board and helped  open the door for Hammer Films' later bloody epics. There's nothing here  that you couldn't see on television today, but the horrific *implications*  of the plot are what give you the shivers. Special effects are crude by  today's standards - a remake would surely improve on that aspect of the  film, but the writing more than makes up that.
Brian Donlevy really makes  a poor Quatermass, but he's all we have. He seems to confuse bullying and  shouting with projecting authority and confidence, and you end up somewhat  surprised no one decks him. (Andrew Keir's interpretation in  ""Quatermass and the Pit"" is a lot more palatable.)
But that  said - see this one. One of the true greats of the genre.",951782400,28,1391,5.030701754385965

772368,5,6304056842,"This is the only film in the Quatermass series to get a remotely loving Blu Ray release in the US as of Spring 2017, which is a terrible shame. It's a great horror Scifi hybrid and one of those fascinating pop culture wellsprings that I take great pleasure in hunting down. Of the three films in the series Xperiment is the most structurally like a horror film, and has influenced a number of stories. Here are chestnuts that would influence Alien, Carpenter's remake of the Thing, Dr. Who, and the X-Files. I'm not sure if it's the first ""possessed astronaut"" story but it is one of the earliest and best I can think of. It's a good scifi movie, a good horror movie and a good monster movie in one package.  Unlike many early sixties scifi, there are no pacing problems. The movie moves along at a good pace and every scene is interesting. It has that ""hammer feel"" by which I mean that it's outdated qualities draw you into the experience of watching it. Quatermass is an interesting protagonist, he's a gruff, beefy, overbearing intellectual and not altogether sympathetic. His walk into the sunset at the end of the picture has a wonderfully ominous quality to it. The Blu Ray comes with an interview with John Carpenter and a commentary by the director, hardly loaded but certainly worth checking out.

I just wish Quatermass and the Pit would be released as a Region 1 Blu Ray. If there is a region free edition out there can someone please tell me? If I was going to spend $70 for an old dvd I'd just invest in a Region free player (which isn't much more than that).",1493078400,3,1573,4.496503496503497

Turns out that Professor Bernard Quatermass jumped the gun and sent a ship into space before the conservative agencies could stop him. Of course this means something has to go wrong. Sure enough three Astronauts wet up and one came back in less than perfect form. Looks like something extraterrestrial is intends to make munchies of Earths flora and fauna. Can Quatermass stop the creature before we become space-chow? And will Quatermass learn his lesson?

""The Creeping Unknown"" (1956) was directed by Val Guest. Was based on the screen plays from a BBC TV serial 1953 BBC Television serial ""The Quatermass Experiment"". The voice-over jokes about this version compressing the first Episode of the serial down to one and a half minutes.

Hammer Replaced Reginald Tate with Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass. This made for a different type of character but did not distract from the story. Brian Donlevy was added for the U.S. audience appeal. In the next Hammer film ""The Abatable Snowman"" he used Forest Tucker. I kept staring at Lionel Jeffries, trying to remember where I saw him before. (""Call Me Bwana"" 1963.)

I loved the Technology that they used from a fire engine that looked like it was out of ""Fahrenheit 451."" The gages in the space ship has speed, altitude, thrust, flux density, etc.

772829,4,6304056842,"Based on the 1953 television series, in which Reginald Tate took the leading role, THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT consciously adopts a cinma-vrit style of filming.  Much of the action takes place at night in the Rolling English countryside; the period vehicles and the use of crowds make us aware of just how significant an event has taken place when the rocket crashes.  The climax takes place in Westminster Abbey in the middle of a BBC broadcast; director Val Guest cleverly combines stock footage with studio sequences to suggest an entire community under threat unless the mutating organism can be destroyed.

In the leading role of the Professor, Brian Donlevy comes across as a determined personality - so determined, in fact, that he cannot contemplate the idea of giving up on his experiments, even though this particular mission has gone horribly wrong.  He is firmly convinced of the rightness of his cause, no more so than in a memorable confrontation with Police Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner), where the Professor leaves the details of the missing astronauts and storms out of the inspector's Office.  At the end of the film we see the Professor walking away from the camera down a deserted Street, thereafter to continue his researches, leaving us wondering whether he is not entirely responsible for the catastrophe.  If he didn't seem so obsessed by the idea of progress, perhaps he wouldn't put people's lives in danger.

Jack Warner has obviously been cast as a foil to the Professor - a dependable presence, preferring to believe in the Bible rather than the miracles of science.  Director Guest uses him as a representative of logic; not the logic of science, but the kind of logic that binds societies together.  The Inspector understands Quatermass's ultimate responsibility for what happened, but there is absolutely nothing he can to do apprehend the Professor.

The idea of familiarity gone wrong - due to the catastrophe - is further reinforced by the casting of a gallery of familiar faces in supporting roles, from Gordon Jackson as the harassed BBC director, to Sam Kydd as a police constable, and Thora Hird as a down-and-out (speaking in a dreadful London Accent) telling her experiences of having witnessed the missing astronaut who has been possessed by the organism (Richard Wordsworth).  The presence of these figures among the cast reinforces the thematic purposes; that an organism can destroy even the most tight-knit societies, unless people pull together to defeat it.  This is precisely what Warner, his fellow police-officers, and half the electricity workers of London manage to achieve.",1417392000,,2624,5.11943793911007

773100,4,6304056842,"How sad that we will most likely never see the original 6-part BBC version of this Nigel Kneale Quatermass outing. I'm no fan of lead actor Brian Donlevy, so that taints my opinion of this film from the get go. Andre Morell is MY favorite Quatermass for his wonderful, spot-on take on the complex character in the 6-part mini-series ""Quatermass & The Pit."" If you haven't seen that masterful production then search for it and pick up a copy. Easily the superior of the two surviving ""Quatermass"" mini-series still available to us.

Story here involves the first rocket ship shot into space (designed & overseen by Prof Quatermass and his scientific team). When the ship returns home Quatermass and the government officials are startled  to discover that 2 of her 3 crew simply vanished without a trace! To make matter worse, the lone survivor of the crew is decidedly not quite right - neither physically nor mentally. (The actor playing the part is unbelievably thin and looks like a walking skeleton, needing little or no make-up to sell the idea.) The doomed astronaut keeps evolving (or is it DEvolving) as the film progresses. Eventually the poor soul mutates into a bizarre creature; a hideous mix of both earthly & extraterrestrial lifeforms, and it's up to the good professor to stop the damnable thing before it begins spawning others like it.

THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT (a.k.a. THE CREEPING UNKNOWN) is a decent stand alone film, but the running time is so brief that it feels like we are rather rushed through to the sensationalized climax. Still, I've grown to really love British sci-fi over the years so, if nothing else, this film at least fills the huge gap left by the apparently lost-forever original miniseries. THE QUATERMASS EXPERIEMENT is a DVD-r release from MGM, which means there are zero extras, with the lone exception of a U.S. trailer. OK, but I'd sure love to see the mini-series which inspired it.

Prof. Bernard Quatermass was a character from some BBC TV serials who made the jump to the big screen in this Hammer Films production (the studio that had a tremendous run of horror films featuring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, among others). I haven't seen any of the earlier Quatermass offerings and I found the character in this story rather bland. Sure he's good at his science and his ego is a little too big. But there is no flamboyance or larger-than-life traits (his ego doesn't seem that big) that often go along with such characters (such as the scientist in the original The Thing or Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes) and makes him stand out. The rest of the cast is okay but I just wasn't impressed.

773106,5,6304056842,"Yes before Hammer films made The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) & The Mummy (1959), Hammer was firing out science fiction films that also leaned towards horror. The Quatermass Xperiment was the first of these films. It was based off of the hit TV six-part serial featuring Professor Quatermass.

Story: The British Rocket Group, headed by Professor Bernard Quatermass, launches its first rocket into space. Shortly after its launch, all contact with the rocket and the three occupants - Carroon, Reichenheim and Green - is lost. The rocket returns to Earth, crashing in an English field.

Quatermass and his assistant Briscoe arrive at the scene, along with the emergency services. Opening the rocket's hatch, they find only Carroon; there is no sign of the other two crewmembers. Carroon appears to be in shock, only able to mouth the words ""Help me"". He is taken to hospital while Quatermass and Briscoe investigate what happened to the rocket and its crew.

It becomes evident that Carroon has been changed by something he encountered while in space. He can absorb any living thing he comes in contact with. When he absorbs a cactus in his hospital room, his right arm begins mutating. Not knowing this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator to break her husband out of the hospital. The escape is successful but Carroon kills and absorbs the private investigator in the process. It does not take long for Judith to discover what her husband has become and Carroon soon flees from his horrified wife.

Inspector Lomax of Scotland Yard, initiates a manhunt to find the missing astronaut. Hiding out at the London docks, Carroon encounters a little girl but through sheer willpower leaves her unharmed. Instead, he heads for a zoo where he absorbs many of the animals. By now, Carroon has become completely mutated. Quatermass and Briscoe track the creature to Westminster Abbey. From his examination of tissue samples taken from Carroon, Quatermass concludes that an alien creature has taken over Carroon and will eventually release spores, endangering the entire planet. With the assistance of a television crew working at the Abbey, Quatermass succeeds in killing the creature by electrocution.

As he leaves the Abbey, Quatermass ignores all those who pass him and ask what's happened, save for his assistant Marsh who than asks him what to do next. Quatermass replies that he'll start all over again. He leaves Marsh and walks away into the London night.

The film has a lot of creepy moments and the black and white adds to the gloom ad atmosphere. The film sort plays out like The Blob an alien organism that absorbs other organisms. However this film is better than The Blob.

The Good: Te film is just perfect. It's the perfect example of a great science fiction/horror film and a great example of a good film in general.

Quatermass in the film is a bit different than he is in the serial, and many fans may dislike that. I like how Quatermass acts, he feels like the man who wants to get done what he has to do.

Sequels: Hammer made 2 sequels, Quatermass 2 AKA Enemy from Space and Quatermass 3: The Pit AKA Five Million Years to Earth. Quatermass 3 is a tad dull but is still well written and well acted. Quatermass 2 is superior to part 3 but is on par with the first film.

Fun Facts: The Quatermass Experiment was a six-part serial broadcast by BBC Television in 1953. Written by Nigel Kneale, it was an enormous success with critics and audiences alike, later described by film historian Robert Simpson as ""event television, emptying the streets and pubs"". Among its viewers was Hammer Films producer Anthony Hinds, who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version. Incorporated in 1934, Hammer had developed a niche for itself making second features, many of which were adaptations of successful BBC Radio productions. Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953, two days after the transmission of the final episode, to enquire about the film rights. Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and, at his urging, the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers, including the Boulting Brothers and Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he felt any film adaptation would inevitably receive an `X' Certificate from the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen. Hammer were not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an `X' Certificate. Hammer's offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that The Quatermass Experiment was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of 500.

Nigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time, which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights. This became a matter of some resentment between Kneale and the BBC and, when his contract came up for renewal, he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work. Despite this, Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of 3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.

The film was co-produced by Robert L. Lippert, an American movie producer and distributor. Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer's films and distributed them in the United States. In return, Hammer's distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert's films in the United Kingdom. Lippert's company was, in fact, a front for 20th Century Fox, whose president, Spyros Skouras, was a close friend of Lippert's. Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios' interests to fund these features in order to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts.

Other Sci-Fi Hammer flicks: Quatermass 2, X the Unknown, The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, and Quatermass 3.

Final thoughts: The film is very gritty and has a dark tone that shrouds the film through out. The film is remarkable and is highly recommended to any body.

DVD/disc: MGM failed to give this amazing film a DVD and instead gave us a DVD-R. This is the only film out of the whole trilogy to not have a proper DVD release except for in Region 2. Naturally since this is a DVD-R there are no special features or even a chapter selection. Still it is nice to own the film, hopefully a DVD distributor will take in the film and give it a proper DVD. Until that day comes keep your DVD-R, Region 2, VHS, and laser disc copies on hand.

In 1955, the same year ""Quatermass II"" aired, Hammer Films came out with a movie adaption called ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" (""The Creeping Unknown"" was its U.S. title) based on Kneale's first Quatermass serial. It starred American actor Brian Donlevy as Professor Quatermass, written by Richard Landau and Val Guest, and directed by Val Guest.

This is a really good movie, but it does have three flaws - two minor, one major. The one major flaw is that Quatermass in this version seems more interrested in science, his successes and failures, more than human life. His character was much better protrayed in the TV version than in this version. This man is suppose to be the hero of the story, not the anti-hero. Even Nigel Kneale didn't like how his character was being protrayed. And it isn't Brian Donlevy's fault, his performance is great, it's just the way they wrote his character. The two minor flaws are the film makers changed the ending by having Quatermass kill the creature by different means, and although I love Brian Donlevy as an actor, it seems very unlikely that an American would be leading a British rocket program. Hammer decided they wanted an American actor because they thought it would appeal more to American audiences, but still decided to base the story in London and about a British rocket program.

On the plus side, performaces are marvelous, the directing is good, so is the lighting, it has some really good eerie moments in it, and the excellent moody music throughout the piece certainly helps create the eerie quality of the film. Overall, it's actually quite a good film, and given the fact that the orginal TV version no longer exists intact (Episodes 1 & 2 still exist, but the other four episodes are missing) this is the best way to enjoy Nigel Kneale's classic sci-fi horror. So to Quatermass fans like me, this movie is a must have!

The Plot:

An experimental spacecraft is launched into space, but when it returns, two crewmembers are missing with only one terrified survivor who seems to be mutating into some form of hideous alien monster. Soon he escapes and goes on a murderous rampage throughout London. When Professor Quatermass, head of the British Rocket Program, learns that the creature is about to multiply, it's a race against time to find and kill the creature before it and its offspring destroy the world!

Near-comatose until he starts moving about London, shapeshifting into an alien.

The liftoff of spaceship Q-1 had gone off without a hitch.  The plan was for it to reach a 1,500 mile altitude, but then, contact with the crew was lost.  By the 57th hour, you had no choice - you had to return them to Earth.  It wouldn't be pretty, you could remotely de-orbit the ship easily enough, but you couldn't control the landing. . . .

If you are Victor, all you know is that some unimaginable disaster has struck your ship, your crew-mates have succumbed to some unspeakable horror and you seem about to follow them.  But gradually the howling outside intrudes on your morbid thoughts: the ship is returning to Earth.  When you come-to, you hear an urgent voice calling from the radio, you desperately try answering, but you can't talk; you begin tapping.  When the outer door slides open, you painfully crawl to its threshold and tumble out onto the wet ground. . . .

Comment:  This is, indeed, a creepy movie.  Perhaps the best effect is the scene where Quatermass and others watch the film from the ship's automatic movie camera.  The film is silent, grainy, shows only one viewpoint, periodically cuts off and apparently you see all important events, but after viewing it, you still won't know what really happened - clever.

773219,3,6304056842,"The Quatermass movies started out as TV episodes first and, IMHO, they get better as they go along.  The stories are good and the themes are interesting, but the older they are the worse the special effects and acting seems to be.  In other words, the newer movies/TV episodes are more interesting and have better hooks than the first few.  So, The Quatermass Xperiment, while the ground breaking first, that started the whole she-bang, is very likely not going to hook you.  True, we meet Quatermass.  And it does help set up the setting of this world where the British has the most advanced space program.  If you ever watched MST3K, this has the same plot of Monster Go-Go but at least it has the excuse of being made earlier, in 1955.
The plot - man comes back from space with something wrong.  He is no longer a MAN.  He is some kind of animal-plant thingie.  Hard to explain really.  Also it is dark.  I just don't mean in the theme or plot, but in the scenes.  Sometimes you just can't SEE what everybody is screaming about.
The important part is that Quatermass helped shape early Doctor Who, so if you love British sci-fi you should try to watch a few of the movies.  Also, if you liked this film you will love the latter films/TV episodes which I DID enjoy and DO re-watch many times.  This one, I may watch again in the far future.

773372,5,6304056842,"The second and third films in the quintessentially British science fiction trilogy about Bernard Quatermass and his investigations of strange happenings in London and the English countryside have been available on DVD for years. But this one, the first of the series, has not. Fans had to watch ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" (a.k.a. ""The Creeping Unknown"") on bootleg DVDs or even video tapes. This studio release was thus very eagerly anticipated.

It's a short film, at about 82 minutes, but it packs in a lot of story. An ill-fated rocket carrying a crew of three men soars to an altitude of 1,500 miles and, after a 57-hour flight, crashes back to Earth outside of London. The sole surviving astronaut inexorably mutates into a horrible creature that absorbs any kind of living organism (plant, animal or human) and grows to enormous size as it satisfies its insatiable appetites. It's a simple concept, but it's presented extremely well. The special effects are great for their day, especially the eerie scenes of the rocket poking up like a giant lawn dart from an English field, and the quality of the DVD itself is excellent. The picture is crisp, sharp and stable, with excellent contrast, and the sound track is clear and distinct. In a couple of spots near the end, the music slightly overwhelms the dialogue, but I suspect that's intentional. Also, the characters sometimes talk very fast, which means American ears may have trouble picking out every word of the Queen's English. This does not detract from the excellence of the production.

I've seen ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" probably about four times over the last several decades, and each time I pick up something new or an additional nuance. The film has layers of complexity and detail that you may not notice on first viewing. But, if you watch it again, you'll have a couple of ""Aha!"" moments. These make it the best kind of classic science fiction movie--one worth re-watching every five years or so.

This brings me to my only concern. The recent trend of studios producing DVDs ""to order"" makes me wonder about the lifetime of these products (plus it seems that they should be cheaper, and they're not, but that's another issue). Googling doesn't really help--I've seen seemingly authoritative estimates that these kinds of DVDs last anywhere from five to 30 years before they become unplayable. So will ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" still work the next time I want to watch it--or the time after that, or after that? I don't know. Perhaps some knowledgeable techie can weigh in with the facts.

This film was based on the 1953 BBC Television serial ""The Quatermass Experiment"". In the U.K. the film came out with the title ""The Quatermass Xperiment"", as Hammer Films was eager to exploit the X rating of the film. The film is about the only survivor of a spacecraft that has crash landed back on earth. The  astronaut is traumatized and unable to communicate. During the astronaut's hospitalization it becomes apparent that he is no longer the same man who left for space. This film is a memorable and intriguing look at the horror of the unknown, and has its place alongside other alien possession films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""(1956). The film was followed by ""Enemy from Space"" (1957: also known as Quatermass II), ""Five Million Years to Earth""(1968:also known as Quatermass and the Pit), and the ""Quartermass Conclusion""(1980)

773481,4,6304056842,"Released in 1955, ""Quatermass Xperiment"" is a creepy, horrifying masterpiece of science fiction.  What is the Quatermass Experiment?  Professor Barnard Quatermass sends three British astronauts into the far reaches of the galaxy for observations.  Their rocket crash lands on earth and only one astronaut, Victor Caroon, remains on board.  Empty space suits of the other two are immediately found.  Escaping from the hospital, Caroon attacks and absorbs plants, animals, and humans.  Each time he feeds, he mutates into a creature that is a composite of all its victims until it finally resembles a shapeless glob with numerous tentacles.

  Brian Donlevy does a superb job as Quatermass.  However, in ""Quatermass Xperiment,"" Quatermass is more ruthless and less compassionate than his character in ""Quatermass and the Pit.""  He is obsessed with the progress of science no matter the cost of human lives.  The disaster with the first rocket mission is barely over before he begins planning another.  I was more fond of the Professor Quatermass from ""Quatermass and the Pit.""  I wished he had been in this film.

  ""Quatermass Xperiment"" was such a big success that it gave Hammer Production enough money to finance the gothic horror films that came later.  If only ""Quatermass Xperiment"" had been made in color like ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" or ""Horror of Dracula.""  It would have been incredible.

  The pacing of the movie is quite good; it is never boring.  The special effects were excellent for that time; the victims'' corpses, especially their faces, were gruesome.  However, a higher body count would've been nice.

  ""Quatermass Xperiment"" was definitely an influence on ""The Blob,"" which was released in 1957 and starred Steve McQueen.  It also influenced the mutating monsters that were found in such modern hits as ""Relic"" and ""Resident Evil.""

773483,5,6304056842,"Before a little British company called Hammer became famous for Dracula and Frankenstein, there were the adventures of Professor Bernard Quatermass. Based on the live BBC serial from 1953, The Quatermass Xperiment put Hammer on the film world map. How that happened it obvious from this tense, realistic, and gritty science fiction classic.

The film is immensely helped by an excellent cast. Brian Donlevy's Quatermass is the archetype science fiction film scientist: a scientist obsessed with their quest for science before turning having to deal with the consequences of that quest. Donlevy plays Quatermass to perfection as a scientist who is both horrified and fascinated by the events he has set in motion. It's a strong performance filled with realism. fascination and horror. The cast also includes terrific performances from Jack Warner as Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax, Margia Dean who takes the potentially clichd Judith Carroon and puts flesh and blood on the character, and David King-Wood as Quatermass's fellow scientist Doctor Briscoe. The best performance of the film may well be from the character who never speaks: Richard Wordsworth as Victor Carroon. Wordsworth perfectly plays both the horror of the lone surviving astronaut and also sympathy as the worst off victim of the Quatermass experiment. This is especially true in a scene where Caroon finds himself at a dock where a little girl approaches him with her doll. It reminds one of the scene from the Universal Frankenstein where the seemingly innocent takes on a darker meaning. Overall, the film has a terrific cast of actors bringing it to life.

At a time when science fiction films were defined by the clichd and outrageous monster and alien invasion films, this film (and its TV counterpart) went in the exact opposite direction. Director Val Guest choose to do the film not in the style of the time but in a near documentary style. That's why the film work's fifty years later: it seems real in that it is a product of its time and place. If Britain had started the space race in the mid-1950's, one feels this is how it would have been.

The film is also helped by two very strong elements: the black and white cinematography and the music score. Doing the film in black and white adds atmosphere to a film that is part alien invasion and part manhunt. It helps especially in the film's fiery finale. The music score by James Bernard is terrific in adding to the atmosphere of the film and it never intrudes, but just helps to bring one a little bit closer to the edge of one's seat. The film wouldn't be the same without either one of these two elements.

Yet as much as I would like to call this film perfect, it isn't. There is one thing that the film hits and misses on: special effects. The downside of the film being so much a product of its time is that when the special effects are looked back at from a distance, they look primitive. That's not to say that the special effects are bad. The prosthetics work in particular looks good even by today's standards as far as I'm concerned. The finale of the film is the most obvious spot where the special effects are a bit of a let down by modern standards. Then again, it is hard to compare special effects from one era to another so this is an issue for the viewer to decide on.

While the special effects may hamper the film for some, one must admit that The Quatermass Xperiment is a classic of the genre. From the terrific performance (especially of Donlevy and Wordsworth), to the realistic style and tone, to the excellent cinematography, to the dark score by James Bernard, The Quatermass Xperiment is a tour de force for the more intelligent and less action based science fiction films. If you can put aside the mid-1950's special effects, you're going to find a tense, realistic, and gritty science fiction classic.",1211328000,3,3865,4.762686567164179

I understood better and it didn't bother me.

  Basicly I like the film. When you consider that this is mid 50's London

when true special effects weren't even around yet,I think the film super-

cedes itself into a wonderful smooth-flowing movie even if the plot is

somewhat typical of Sci-fi movies of the 50's. For what it's worth,even

the United States did't have the best sci-fi special effects like the

ones we see today with comperization. It actually took real crews of men

and women to produce those effects.

  Brian Donlevy in his performance as the arrogant Professor Quatermass

is so hateful you have to love him. Another memorable one is Richard

Wordsworth who play Carroon. Absolutely brilliant. I also found amusing

the overly dramatic expresssion of the BBC announcer in the trailor who

witnesses this unknown thing with his own eyes. Only the TV announcer

in Gorgo did better. The only notables are King-Wood who play the good

doctor's assistant and Jack Warner who played Lomax. I liked his sarcasm

when talking to Quatermass. Actually brought Quatermass to his knees if

only in a figurative sense. Otherwise everyone else just essentially

played their parts. Still it is good science fiction fun.",1174003200,6,1446,4.904564315352697
773485,4,6304056842,"Although generally regarded as Hammer's first foray into the realm of science-fiction, two previous films THE FOUR SIDED TRIANGLE and SPACEWAYS had suggested with their overall ineptitude that genre films were perhaps something Hammer should steer clear of.  But in re-making a BBC TV serial for the big screen Hammer had an ace up their sleeve and an audience ready made for the big screen adventures of Prof. Bernard Quatermass. Despite the terrible miscasting of Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, the film succeeds admirably. It still feels odd to watch a Hammer film in Black and White, but this adds to the documentary like quality that veteran director Val Guest was seeking (to aid this attempt at verisimilitude, we also have newspaper headlines and on a few occasions some hand-held camera work - very rare for 1955). With its dedication to actual scientific concepts and well written and researched source material by Nigel Kneale (a writer who is criminally under-rated) THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT retains a topical feel. In Quatermass' constant clashes with authority, Kneale threads in a number of critiques about modern society and its absurd predilection for red tape and bureaucracy. Despite these and other things, when reduced to its basic narrative, this film is an exploration of possession and feeds into the same paranoid fears that Don Siegel exposed so well with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. Gothic elements abound also, with the eerie isolated location that opens the film and the idea of double or multiple identities. Sadly Kneale over-emphasises Britain's importance in the world and the idea of the United Kingdom being the first country to send manned rockets into space is rather quaint and somewhat amusing. Donlevy's boorish and arrogant Quatermass is balanced well with the genuinely moving and upsetting performance by Richard Wordsworth as the invaded astronaut Caroon. For pure atmosphere and tension this remains a high watermark for Hammer, only bettered perhaps by the sequel QUATERMASS 2.",1156809600,5,2025,5.269349845201238
773486,4,6304056842,"Seen today, it seems incredible that THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT  could have ever been rated ""X""--even in stodgy old England of 1955.  But so it was, and it proved extremely popular, and when it was released in the United States as THE CREEPING UNKNOWN it proved more popular still.  In fact, the film was so popular that it essentially created England's Hammer Studios, and for the next decade or so ""Hammer Horror"" would prove a formidable box office draw.

Loosely based on a previously aired BBC series, QUATERMASS was hardly original even for 1955--but the basic idea has an almost timeless appeal; every sci-fi and horror writer from Lovecraft to Stephen King has created a variation at one time or another.  In this instance, Dr. Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) has sent a rocket with three passengers into ""outer space.""  But the rocket goes missing, and when it suddenly crashlands in the English countryside two of the astronauts are dead and one is--well, he is strange, to say the least.

Survivor Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth) is alternately comatose and spastic, and as time passes his skin begins to alter.  Scientists soon realize the unpleasant truth: Victor is not alone in his own body; he has been infected by another life form that seems determined to reproduce and take over the world!

Shot on a shoestring budget in black and white, QUATERMASS is indeed an antiquated little film, but even so it still manages to cast a spell.  It has mood, it has pace, and although it is really more interesting for its place in cinema history it is nonetheless quite a bit of fun to watch.  Brian Donlevy seems a bit out of place in Merrie Old England, but his performance has lots of drive; Richard Wordsworth is memorable indeed as the very unfortunate astronaut; and the film is sprinkled through with the likes of character actress Thora Hird, who is a lot of fun because she's so good, and ingenue Margia Dean, who is a lot of fun because she's so bad.  As for the monster--well, it's pure 1955, if you know what I mean.

In terms of film quality, QUATERMASS could certainly use a major remaster, but it's worth remembering that the film quality was probably never all that great to begin with, and all the prints I've seen of the film are about the same re quality.  Recommended to fans of science-fiction and horror films of the period.

773487,5,6304056842,"The Quatermass Xperiment as it was titled for its cinema release, is very simply on of the British Film Industry's classic films. It was a trail blazer for the then fledgling Hammer Films, and because of its success, Hammer were able to go forward and make the incredible catalogue of films that they would eventually end up with.
Director Val Guest condenses the much longer TV series down into a 80 minute film. The result is a gem of a film that has stood the test of time, and is still a compelling watch.

Basically the plot sees the headstrong Professor Quatermass send a rocket into space without official clearance. The rocket subsequently returns to Earth but of the three crew, there is only one astronaut remaining on board.
This sole survivor is played by Richard Wordsworth (a descendant of the poet - William Wordsworth). He gives a compelling and unsettling performance as Victor Kerroon, a man who is metamorphosising into something monstrous. His scene with the small girl on the London Docks is a powerful example of this, and the viewer can see many similarities with the famous scene from the original Frankenstein, where Boris Karloff's monster has a similar, almost surreal encounter with a small child.
Helping Quatermass is Jack Warner's Police inspector, a typically solid performance from Warner in a role which plays to his strengths.
Quatermass and the Police and Army face a race against time to track down this ever changing monstrousity before it is too late.
SFX are good for the time and can still stand muster with some of today's.
The atmosphere and sets are truly unique, and the viewer is treated to a chase amidst smoggy and still bomb damaged 1950s London. A particular setting which is both atmospheric and unsettling in its own right.

I originally did not like Brian Donlevy in the role but have softened towards his performance on repeat viewings. Director Val Guest also makes it quite clear that he chose Donlevy because he was readly identifiable as a man of the people, instead of someone aloof, and that rings true. There was also the consideration of at that time, to get a US distributor, you needed an American actor in the role, therefore, Guest makes it quite clear in the commentary, that he was doubly glad to land Donlevy.
Additionally, in all fairness to the actor, Donlevy's final words also are chilling in this film, and it is hard to imagine a more refined Quatermass saying them with the same chilling intensity and conviction.

The film is available on Region 2 DVD and it is a brilliant transfer. Picture is superb and is one of the best black and white pictures that I have seen on DVD. Sound is obviously Mono but is still nonetheless impressive.
The Quatermass Xperiment can be obtained as a single DVD or as part of a double disc box set, along with Quatermass 2.
The latter is my preferred option, the box set is high quality and each film has its own booklet full of background details such as interviews with the Director and cast, original reviews, pictures etc.
This is a Region 2 DVD, so anyone living in the USA will need a Multi Region player to play it back on. However, another example of a film well worth upgrading to Multi Region play for.
Both the single DVD and the two disc/two film Box Set are available from Amazon.co.uk.",1149552000,7,3307,4.70811744386874

7860585,4,6304056842,"I love sci-fi/horror B-movies from the '50s and '60s, and this is one of the better ones.  The story is good; some aspects are a bit derivative but mostly the story is quite original and you can see the influence of this film in many sci-fi/horror films that followed (I can't say which ones without spoiling the plot).  This movie is also more serious and far less cheesy than most '50s sci-fi/horror B movies.  (Not that there's anything wrong with a good cheesy B horror movie.)

After an exciting opening scene, the movie is a slow burn until the last half or third, maybe.  But it's a good slow burn, in which you and the other characters gradually learn what they're dealing with.  Also, there is suspense, creepiness, and dread (in a good way).

The last reel has the most action, the stakes are high, destruction is happening, and there's a race to save the day.

There are sequels, which I haven't seen yet, and the film was made into a TV series which I understand is also quite good.

The picture and sound quality are good for a 70+ year old film.",1507939200,,1059,4.44559585492228
