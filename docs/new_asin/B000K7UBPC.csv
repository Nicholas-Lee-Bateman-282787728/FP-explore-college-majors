2683458,5,B000K7UBPC,"Been thinking about a vacation to France, the Netherlands, or Belgium? Never done so before? Not sure where to begin? Rick Steves series on European travel (here, France and the ""Benelux"" region, a term coined by The Economist Magazine back in the 1940's to describe The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxemburg) is perhaps one of the best ways to start. Rick is your travel companion, and his friendly, affable, and matter-of-fact approach will appeal to anyone wishing to make such a trip but a bit apprehensive about just how to pull it off.

Steves approach is a good one. Each episode is only about 30 -40 minutes in length, and covers some of his highlights picks for the region under discussion. We know immediately than any of these locations would take years of intensive visits to get to know completely, so Steves doesn't attempt to cover too much in such a short time. Rather, he gives you a pleasant, and often stunningly beautiful, tour through the region, pointing out favorite restaurants, hostels, bed and breakfasts, sights, and so on. Even the experienced traveler should enjoy the presentation, which is kept family oriented and points out things that should be on anyone's ""short list"" for the trip. This particular disk does not focus on Paris, so if you are wishing more information specifically on this city, this disk may not be your best bet. But you WILL get a nice sampling of some of the myriad regions of France, so varied in characteristics that it surprises you that you are in the same county.

These videos are terrific for getting your juices going on planning a trip. But if you have never made a trip to the region before, you should follow up with some of the terrific guide books by DK, Knopf, and others to get more detailed information. But for early ""start up"" thinking, brainstorming, or just to have the family together see what Europe has to offer, you can't beat Rick Steves. Fun, fun, fun.",1212710400,,1931,4.744047619047619
2683459,5,B000K7UBPC,"Has there ever been another travel guide more amiable, more informative, more eclectic and just plain likeable than Rick Steves?  This somewhat nerdish but pleasant looking fellow will immediately win the viewer over with his charm, humor and smoothing, layback manner. However what will keep you watching program after program is his consummate knowledge of the sites and people he visits.

While each journey is only 30 minutes in length Rick has a unique talent of synthesizing the many facets that make up a people and place. He leaves no stone unturned in his analysis; historical background, spiritual heritage, cultural underpinnings and political legacy are all equally touched upon to give the audience a fuller understanding of the rural and urban landscape.

However not not an individual to dwell too much on the past, he provides a delightful tour of the markets, music, restaurants and nightlife. The kind of information would really want to know if you're out for a good time.

The production values are also wonderful offering fanstastic visuals that are worth watching even if there where no commentary. Traveling with Rick Steves' is the next best thing to being there.

This particular DVD contains eight episodes, thirty minutes in length. Imagine four hours in France and Benelux await, better get started!",1207526400,6,1327,5.182242990654205

We all wish that traveling would always be this easy: one on one tour guides who are insightful and well-versed,  bicycles-at-the-ready, good, reasonably priced hotels, food and drink typical of local tastes.  This is just what we expect of Rick Steves' trips.  A great travelogue.",1402012800,,396,5.442622950819672

8154718,4,B000K7UBPC,"I wonder how many other people wonder why these travel films are so short.  However, Rick Steves does a great job covering the various dimensions of travel in France regardless of the traveler's interests.  The culture, art, and history are well represented as are the gourmet delights, entertainment, and even the simple pleasures of the market.  It's pleasant to see him visiting places my wife and I enjoyed plus the special locations or events we missed.  Perhaps another trip is in order?  The production seems very good--the views of street scenes, the countryside, and Roman remains.  Every effort is made to make one comfortable with French everyday life in the places visited.  The little out-takes at the end are a nice touch.  That one wishes the show to continue in yet another village or riverside is perhaps the best measure of how well the episodes are put together.",1392076800,,881,4.905405405405405
