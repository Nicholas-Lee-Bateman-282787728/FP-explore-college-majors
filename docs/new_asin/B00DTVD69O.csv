5855588,5,B00DTVD69O,"For those of you who, like me, are interested in which episodes of ""Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures"" are contained on this DVD, here is the list:
01. ""Nothing To Fear But Berries Themselves"" (October 28, 2010) - After a blackout, Orange discovers she has a fear of what's in the dark.
02. ""Where, Oh Where Has My Blueberry Gone?"" (October 29, 2010) - Blueberry spends all her time emulating a literary detective hero until Strawberry gives her a case.
03. ""Lost And Found"" (November 15, 2010) - Strawberry loses her pets and her friends help find them.",1381881600,20,566,4.785714285714286
5855589,2,B00DTVD69O,"We are HUGE Strawberry Shortcake collectors and were very disappointed when we received this ""new release"". The title ""Berry Bitty Mysteries"", makes fans think the DVD contains the most recent episodes where Blueberry Muffin and Huckleberry Pie are mystery writers. The episodes are not named on the back, adding to the confusion. There is also a description of one episode mentioning lost pets. Which we incorrectly believed this described an episode with the new puppies.

Buyer beware! This ""new release"" DVD contains episodes that are 3-4 years old. They are pre-Cherry Jam and certainly pre-Huckleberry Pie and the puppies. We were very disappointed. I felt like we were intentionally deceived. Not cool!  Don't fall for it parents. We love Strawberry, but they really dropped the ball on this one.",1380326400,20,803,5.217054263565892
