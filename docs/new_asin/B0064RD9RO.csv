4952972,5,B0064RD9RO,This DVD is the greatest I love it. I watch it almost everyday. I can't wait until the Season 2 DVD release.,1344902400,,108,3.9545454545454546
4952973,5,B0064RD9RO,I purchased this DVD for a friend as a birthday gift.  She LOVES the Braxton show so I'm sure that she will love this video!!!,1336953600,,126,4.04
4952974,5,B0064RD9RO,"I love this reality show! Comparing it to all the others the best hands down. This show is about the relationships of sisters. Sisters are all unique in there own way. They share the highs and the lows. It showcase their sucess as well as their failures. How they cope and come together as a family in the end.
It doesn't have all the disrespect and fowl language that many of these shows have on tv today. It is the day to day life of these sisters. It has purpose. The show is about something. Their families, marriage, raising children, careers, loves and lost.
I adore this show and waiting on the season 2 dvd. I purchased the first one..lol",1333843200,2,646,4.391666666666667
4952975,5,B0064RD9RO,"When I first heard about Toni Braxton getting a reality show with her sisters, I was a bit wary. Toni's been doing her thing in the music scene for about 2 decades with a few Grammys to her name and while I knew about her financial issues, I didn't think it was such a good idea to put her life on tv for all to see. I'm glad to say I was wrong. Braxton Family Values does get into serious territory from time to time, but for the most part it's light and fun and celebrates the tight bond the sisters seem to have with each other.

While Toni is the most known to the public, she's the oldest of five sisters.

I have to start with Tamar, the baby, because she is a mess who will pop off at the mouth whenever and however she wants. You can thank (or blame) her for bringing "".com"" and "".org"" back as catch phrases. She's the only other sister to release a solo record back in the day, but it flopped and these days she's made it her mission to step away from being her big sister's back-up singer and release another record of her own. She drives her husband Vince (who manages Lady Gaga and used to be Toni's manager) crazy with her constant demands and overall brattiness. As annoying and ""over the top.com"" as she is, Tamar is entertaining and will have you rolling with her irreverent comments.

Now going back in order, Traci had to drop out of the entertainment industry once she gave birth to her son, got married, and settled in the family's native Baltimore. Because of that, she feels like an outsider and wants so desperately to sing with her sisters again. She and Tamar bump heads alot since Tamar is supreme when it comes to inserting her opinion when it isn't warranted.

Towanda is married with 2 young children, but her relationship with her husband is complicated, to put it simply. They're separated yet he still lives with her so he can co-parent. He could live somewhere else (and get off his behind and get a job) and still co-parent, but I digress. On top of the stress at home, Towanda is Toni's personal assistant and has to put up with her sister's often silly demands. Trina is also married with 2 kids and the relationship with her husband is strained. Apparently he's cheated on her for most of their marriage yet has the nerve to track HER every move. Then again it's a smart move because Trina loves to knock back the sauce a bit too much, if you know what I mean. There's an episode dedicated to her DUI and all that drama. That aside, Trina is funny with her open freakiness (think Lynn from Girlfriends) and frank comments.

Then there's mom Evelyn. She's a lovely Christian woman who loves her daughters with all her heart, but won't hesitate putting them (*cough*TAMAR*cough*) in check when needed. She's still healing from the betrayal of her ex-husband (an ex-minister who now acts like a pimp from a bad blaxploitation flick) and you've gotta see the showdown between them in one of the final episodes. I'll leave it at ""you laid it low and spread it wide!""

Every episode is fun to watch and will hold your attention. If you're in need of something to make you laugh and feel like you're one of the family, chill with the Braxtons. ""DOO WOP POP POP with Toni Braxton. THAT AIN'T HOT!"" I beg to differ. ;)",1327968000,9,3246,4.410684474123539
4952976,5,B0064RD9RO,"I absolutely loved season 1 of the Braxtons! So much drama and laughter. If you missed watching this on TV, I recommend buying a copy of the DVD. It was totally worth it. I think I have watched it 3 times since I received my copy. Great show!",1327449600,4,242,4.0625
4952977,5,B0064RD9RO,"Oh how I enjoyed the very first season of The Braxtons on WETV.  The fact they are sisters and talented makes it's more worth watching!  As a person who watches reality tv occasionally, I've grown tired of talentless socialites being viewed as stars and/or the average person making a fool of themselves for a mere 15-minutes of fame.  The Braxtons, while they are now part of the reality tv formula, they show why they have been in the music business for over 20 years lead by star Toni Braxton.

Toni Braxton is a platinum selling-Grammy winning recording star whose faced the ups and downs of the business.  She's filed for bankruptcy a few times and has met her fair share of health issues (this will be revealed later in the season).  Overall she keeps a positive outlook on life and continues being a great singer and parent to her sons.

Tamar is without question the diva of all her sisters.  She very funny with coin phases '.org' and '.com.' She has a drive to get away from sister Toni's shadow and becoming a star in her own right.  Tamar is also married to Vince Herbert who manages Toni and Lady Gaga who is quite headstrong and doesn't let her get away with much of anything.

Towanda also has dreams of being more than Toni's personal assistant and background singer.  She has visions of being a movie actress.  Trina is fun and silly but you will see she likes hitting the bottle alot during this season.  Traci is the sister who never got a chance to be in the business like her sisters, while she still keeps this dream alive she stays the devoted mother.  You will plus be introduced to Trina's, Traci's and Towanda's husbands all of which are quite interesting as the season progresses.

Lastly, you will be see alot of the girls mother, Evelyn, who is sweet yet has no problem telling it how it is especially to Tamar.

I will say if you haven't seen season 1, don't heistant to pick this up.  5 out of 5 stars!",1323648000,14,1933,4.461538461538462

I have 4 sisters and we are all busy, funny, loud and crazy.  We can get on each others nerves sometimes but overall we are sisters and we love and support each other just like these sisters do.

In that vein I hoped that there would be alot of singing in the show and I was not disappointed.  I like all the sisters and their back stories.  Though I don't believe the reality part of reality tv, I do enjoy watching the show. I do however feel that Toni Braxton is not in the show all that much but I know that she is ill and also did not want to be the focal point of the show.  The different locations where they shoot are interesting as well, from the Bahamas to ATL, Miami, and Los Angeles.",1426464000,,671,4.022556390977444

I get to hear humor, honesty, get to learn their personalities, view their talent during rehearsals while also hearing their commentary which is great.  I get to see parts of free concerts here & there and what's better than that?  I also get to see a little drama between the sisters, esp. Tamar & Towanda like most families have but without them being too ratchet.",1423440000,,465,4.447058823529412

They have a special love for one another that will keep them a very close family even through their rough times. I have raised children non stop since I was 17 and I am now 63 and still going strong . With in all those years I have never seen a love like the Braxtons have for each other.

The rest deal with real life issues and the mother and father and kids chime in to add entertainment.

But most importantly I love it how they're all different and bring different tools to the show, it makes it entertaining and they are an amazing family, full of talent. I really wish them all the success they can get.

4953018,1,B0064RD9RO,"Shocking! Honestly, I thought Tamar Braxton was in her early 20 based only in her superficial childish behavior, I surprised to find out she is a 36 year old woman. This woman comes across has being psychological mental unstable:
1. Even her husband repeatedly calls her crazy and needing mental help throughout  the episodes
2. He calls her stupid, having a bad attitude, and childish (a woman almost 40 years old) ridiculous!
3. Abnormally refers to herself as ""she"" or ""her"" rather than I
4. She selfish. He said it too. This almost 40 year old woman refuses to have children because she is more concern with her body looking bad. She does not have much time before her eggs dry up at her age! She has no concern of other people, no concern for her husband.
5. She has a nasty rude attitude that is not cute (which her husband continue to  remind her)
6. She is overly dramatic (possible to seek more attention)
7. She does not listen or respect her husband. She really annoys him with her mouth, which I do not understand how on earth he put up with her or married her.
8. She does not know how to stop talking
9. She makes strange and bizarre clown faces with her lips poked out and her neck moving as if she mentally disturbed.
10. She is in a fantasy that she is pretty
11. She is extremely shallowly materialistic
12. She always want to be the ""center of attention"" and wants to be catered to
13. Always trying to imitate and look like a white woman
14. There is something unnatural and artificial about her look (besides fake hair and eyelashes), as if she had some plastic surgery done mainly to her face.
Under this loud mouth, rude, and superficial ugly personality woman she clearly psychological displays a lot of insecurities which would lead to plastic surgery.",1359936000,4,1777,4.515527950310559

Please keep tbem coming!!! lol anyway but please! please! please! explain to these beautiful women everyone's different, everyone takes pain and divorce differently, everyone mourns diff. And divorce is like a death in the family. The sisters also have to remember they attacked Tamar as soon as she discussed her divorce. It was a bit childish for them to do that just out of payback due to how she reacted to them in the same situation. She's hurting very badly, she didn't need that and now you wonder why she's being to herself. It's not fair and they must remember everyone mourns, goes through depression, and divorce differently. Its not all about TRINA, Tracy,  Towanda or Toni at the moment its about Tamar. Please understand this and just be there for her and just listen, that's all you need to do at the moment. And if it is a domestic violence type of situation this includes, fear and, embarrassment,  so this too is why she's staying to herself. Please remember all of this., and Tamar please call your mother she meant well and she loves you and you know this so please talk to your mother, because you are hurting her very badly.
