8372468,4,B002L7O7TA,"I am upset that there is no option for subtitles. I wish the product descriptions would say whether there are subtitles or not. Since I don't hear very well, I really need the subtitles. I have to play it quite loud and I'm afraid i may be disturbing my neighbors. Otherwise it is just as good as all the other seasons, as this is one of my favorite series.",1512518400,,357,4.188405797101449

8372470,1,B002L7O7TA,thats crazy price for just ten seasons. that doesnt even include seasons 11-16 which obviously season 16 wouldnt be included considering their are still new episodes that are being created! ive bought complete box sets on amazon before with around the same amount of seasons for 300 or less. if this was cheaper i would def buy it.,1429574400,,331,4.724137931034483

8372475,5,B002L7O7TA,"IT IS GREAT TO WATCH ALL THESE EPISODES WITHOUT COMMERCIALS.  THE SHOW IS GOOD, BUT I MISSED A LOT OF THE EPISODES OVER THE PAST 10 - 12 YEARS - AND THE SELLER WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO SEND ME SEASON 11 AND SEASON 12 AS A BONUS FOR BUYING THE FIRST 10 SEASONS FROM THEM - SO THAT WAS VERY COOL OF THEM, TOO.  THANKS EVERYONE!  JUDITH",1340582400,6,328,3.8656716417910446
