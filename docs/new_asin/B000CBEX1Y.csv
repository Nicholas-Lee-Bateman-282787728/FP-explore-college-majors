8096663,3,B000CBEX1Y,"This is Vol. 1 from Critic's Choice, known for putting out some of the worst quality DVD's I've ever seen.  The shows themselves are pleasant and the quality varies the scale.  The episodes are El Toro, Lady Editor, Wheel of Fortune, and Big Crush.  2 of the episodes are very splicy and the other 2 are better.  They run about 25 minutes and there are no commercials.  Errors on the case and disc are rampant and 2 of the shows have the wrong credits at the end.",1495238400,,463,4.275862068965517
8096664,4,B000CBEX1Y,"Why Robert Cummings ever decided to change to just 'Bob' Cummings I'll never know, but this big screen star of the 1940's is probably best remembered these day as the star of the long running 'Love That Bob' AKA 'The Bob Cummings Show', but before that, when he was still Robert Cummings he made an earlier TV series called 'My Hero', I still think this was the funniest series he ever made, and it's great to see a handful of episodes available on DVD! I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the so-so picture quality. I believe they only made about 33 episodes, and I just wish someone could release mint prints of the entire series in a boxed set.

Robert Cummings played bumbling real estate agent 'Bob Beanblossom', he was a handsome man, but also had an amusing face, and his own wacky personality, and I think was one of the top 5 or 6 comedy actors in the business [Cary Grant,Fred MacMurray,Ray Milland,James Stewart] amongst the others. If you haven't seen 'My Hero', it's worth getting some episodes just to see what real comedy is all about!",1174348800,5,1052,4.507853403141361
