8561005,2,B00B1PT9XW,"Horrible.  Boring.  Not at all mysterious, horrifying, funny, thrilling.  Just plain dreadful movie with a ham actor playing a ham actor.  Poor Ray Milland plays a very insubstantial role really; his best scene is in the Pretty Little Doll song, wearing creepy makeup and behaving like a puppet on a string.  Don't waste your time with this.",1407974400,,341,4.912280701754386
8561006,4,B00B1PT9XW,"A different kind of horror film that didn`t strike me as being all that funny, maybe because I`m not a Brit.  Quite enjoyable and interesting on the whole.  Good quality picture and sound on this region 2 DVD.  Contains a musical score from the film of 30 minutes as a bonus.",1371686400,,275,4.352941176470588
