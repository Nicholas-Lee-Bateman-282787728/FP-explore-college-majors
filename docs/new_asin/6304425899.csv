7870992,5,6304425899,"Richard A. Wolters was a longtime friend who died in 1993.  Dick was founder of the North American Hunting Retriever Association (NAHRA). I campaigned Labs with him and used his training technique to develop  wonderful hunting companions. Anyone interested in owning and hunting with  a first class retriever will benefit from Wolters' training tips, videos  and books.  A good retriever is an important wildlife conservation tool.  You will add further to your enjoyment by joining NAHRA to work with other  retrievers and retriever owners. Good hunting and great success!",911606400,28,573,5.370786516853933
