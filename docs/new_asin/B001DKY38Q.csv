8607013,5,B001DKY38Q,"I am a Communications teacher at a local college, and I am constantly looking for ways to advance my own education, so I do this by watching educational videos, such as this.  I have watched over 50 educational videos, and Rendall's are by far the best that I've seen.  The information that he gives is so applicable to real life, and he doesn't waste time telling stories that don't relate to the topic.  He is a great public speaker and engages the audience from beginning to end.  He uses humor, which keeps it fun and entertaining, but he does so in a way that does not distract you or take away from the presentation-- it adds to it.  I have watched almost all of Rendall's videos and have enjoyed them all, so if you get this video, I suggest checking out his others because they are just as good- you will not be disappointed.",1251072000,,833,4.383116883116883
