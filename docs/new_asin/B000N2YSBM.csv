8174363,5,B000N2YSBM,"This was the only tape i've seen of Laurel and Hardy on a television appearance.  Here we see the boys not as the famous dumb and dumber characters they play but as real people.  Also, we see people from Laurel and Hardy's past including photos of the boys when they were young.",1389398400,,278,4.326923076923077
8174364,5,B000N2YSBM,"This tape I had not seen before & was not disappointed with the content or the quality of it & suggest all Laurel & Hardy fans watch it!! It has the This Is Your Life segment from early television days & the commercials also, which were done in a different way then!! I remember them days fondly, buy it & enjoy!!!!",1364256000,3,315,4.180327868852459
