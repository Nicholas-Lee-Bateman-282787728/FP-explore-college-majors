987139,5,6305194726,"I enthusiastically recommend this video for anyone at any level.  It is easy to follow and very informative.  More than an exercise program, it aligns your body and spirit, giving you a great sense of strength, clarity,  and inner peace. You will be led through gentle yet challenging poses and  movements using varied breathing techniques and occasional chanting.  If  you are open to experiencing this, you will find it has great rewards.",948412800,15,440,5.041666666666667
987140,5,6305194726,"Having heard so much about the wonder of Kundalini yoga, I bought this tape and tried it out right away.  It is now a part of my regular cycle of yoga tapes, and I do it 2 or 3 times per week, alternated with Power Yoga  workouts.  The beginning of the tape features Gurutej, on a sunny, grass  covered Malibu Mountain top, explaining what Kundalini is, what it means to  your body and what to expect.  Then Gurutej and her small class take you  through a series of 2 ""exercises"" for each of our eight Chakras.  She explains everything very well, emphasizes the breath (sometimes slow  and deep, sometimes breath of fire), and every posture is gentle and  approachable.  The tape also features some chanting and a meditative  session at the end accompanied by 2 gongs/bowls and really clears your head  and relaxes you. I feel like my lungs get a workout as much as my body, and  my spirit just feels more free and calm at the end. I think this is a  wonderful tape for anyone who is interested in yoga for reasons beyond the  aesthetic and cosmetic.  Bear in mind, Kundalini is VERY different from  other forms of yoga. You will not be sweating and quaking, but you will  feel loose, healthy and vibrant.",944352000,46,1205,4.470046082949309
987141,1,6305194726,This tape is NOT a good introduction to Yoga.  The instructor's incessant chatter breaks up concentration and the excercises don't flow from one to another.,943833600,10,156,5.24
987142,5,6305194726,"I have bought a few yoga tapes and this one really was what I was looking for.  Using kundalini yoga techniques, this workout leaves you feeling centered and balanced.  It gives you a lot of good information of how it  looks like in your life when each of the chakras are out of alignment.",919123200,3,289,4.314814814814815

7885024,5,6305194726,"This is my favorite kundalini exercise routine. It's just demanding enough and easy enough to practice without too much strain and still leaves me feeling good. Some other kunalini routines I've tried have left me feeling a little tired or strained. After this routine my body feels good, like I've worked it and my mind is both calm and  sharp and I am in tune with the flow of my life.
I truly love this video. It works for me.
Gurutej Kaur explains what we are trying to achieve with each asana what to look for and how it should make me feel. I like her approach very much. She is a very good teacher. This is more than a physical work out. Each pose stands on it's own for a reason. This is not hatha or vinyasa yoga.  I have read that a student should learn to practice hatha yoga in order to prepare the body for kundalini yoga. I practiced hatha yoga for three years before I tried kundalini. I still practice hatha yoga everyday for the physical benefits and kundalini when ever I feel the need.  It took a few practices for me to learn what it is about. I read three books about kundalini, one before I began my practice and two more later to help me understand. It is more than physical exercise.

I must say here that I have read that kundalini is not for everyone. It could change your life. It works on opening up your chakras (energy centers) and some times we are not ready for that experience. One teacher told a student that if you are happy with your life you should stay with hatha yoga and not do kundalini. The best advice I can offer is to do a little research about kundalini before making the decision to begin that practice.

Peace be with you and namasta.",1248652800,3,1682,4.2933753943217665
7885025,5,6305194726,"I love ALL of Gurutej Kaur's 4 DVDs. This is her first, but for me the last one I got.  She met Yogi Bhajan in 1969 & one of his origional students. Bhajan is credited for having brought Kundalini Yoga here to the United States.
This is set outside with 2 guys & 2 girls all doing the exercises & her doing a few then teaching more as they move. The production values are well done, lighting, sound, video. The mountain side & ocean beyond is beautiful.
Unlike Ravi & Ana Brett's DVDs, Gurutej does the more slowly in a relaxed way & for not as long. I still feel wonderfully energized like Ravi & Ana's, though sometimes with theirs, I feel dizzy & mildly sick for up to 30 min, probably because I moved so much energy & detoxing too much, too soon.

There are many reviews here & 18 more on the VHS version that combined give you great word for word about the great 2 large beautiful singing bowl meditation at the end & the 2 movements per 8 chakras (8th being aura).
For those who don't know what kundalini is, it's a way to open up your chakras to help move your spiritual energy to help with emotional & physical ailments from them being too open/excess or too closed/deficient or stagnant/not moving. It is a more aerobics/power yoga style in a way that 2 poses are done back/forth many times semi fast or very fast with ""breath of fire"" usually which is like a dog panting fast. There are always 30 seconds - 3 min breaks in between so your spirit/body can get used to the new release of energy & balance out before doing more.  It's like any exercise, you want to stop & see if you're ready for more or deciding to stop completely until your body can get used to the good changes. Balance is listening to your body to know when to move & when to rest.",1188000000,11,1760,4.2477611940298505
7885026,4,6305194726,"Originally, I enjoyed doing this DVD at night because it truly left me relaxed and was simple, but worked the body and nervous system.  I think Gurutej Kaur has a marvelous way of describing how the chakras relate to our practical existence.  It was this ""tune up"" which made me investigate kundalini yoga because I could directly observe how this type of yoga altered my entire disposition.  This is a great introduction to this esoteric body/mind technology.  The only reason I am knocking one star off of its rating is that I wish Gurutej Kaur would have created a true kundalini kriya or set without long breaks where she explains each exercize.  She could have easily described each exercise's benefits over a workout sequence like Ravi Singh does and created a tighter set.  Despite this fact, it is still a good addition to a kundalini DVD library.",1144800000,27,855,4.782312925170068
7885027,5,6305194726,I love this tape. I feel a great buzz of wonderful energy when I'm done. I am not a yoga expert and definitely a beginner but found the poses pretty easy to do! Her class is outside in the mountains which is also nice.,1136073600,9,218,3.977272727272727
7885028,5,6305194726,Just did the Chakra Yoga last night before going to sleep. Around 5:00 am I had a feeling that my whole body was pulsing and I had an overwhelming sense of well-being. I even had a smile on my face. I wasn't completely awake. But when I did wake up I was ready for the day...full of energy. This practice REALLY works. Recommend it for everyone.,1126483200,24,345,4.242424242424242
7885029,5,6305194726,"If you want to try Kundalini Yoga to find out if it's right for you, this is the video to buy.
This was my first Kundalini Yoga video. I'd practiced Hatha Yoga for years before ever hearing about Kundalini Yoga. The exercises challenged my stamina and flexibility at first as I'd gotten out of shape, but became easy after several months of daily practice. Now I use this video when I want a less rigorous practice.
You can use this video daily if you are careful not to strain yourself. (I still use firm, flat pillows to protect my knees).
Gurutej Kaur introduces you the basics of Kundalini Yoga. You are introduced to the bhandas (locks) pranayama(breathing exercises), mudras(hand positions), and mantras (chanting) that are a part of Kundalini Yoga. She explains the purpose and meaning of these as you go through the postures.
I would not practice a chant or anything else if I did not understand its purpose and meaning. Now that I am more advanced, I use the extra time to hold the postures longer, deepening the practice. The ability to focus, to tune inward while maintaining awareness of the outer environment, is one of the many fruits of yoga practice. I suspect that those reviewers who express annoyance with the amount of instruction do not understand this.
Kundalina Yoga is for serious yoga practitioners. If you are on a spiritual path, it will enhance your awareness of your inner divinity and your ability to create the life you want.
Gurutej Kaur wears a turban because she practices the Sikh religion as does Yogi Bhajan, the guru that brought this yoga from India to the west. You don't have to practice the Sikh religion to practice this yoga and no mention of it is made on the video.
After having purchased several wonderful Kundalini Yoga videos, this is the one I'd recommend to those who want an introduction to Kundalini Yoga.",1086307200,22,1858,4.737654320987654
7885030,3,6305194726,"I enjoyed the chakra work out, but not without a few reservations.  When I first did Gurutej Kaur's Chakra yoga work out, I found myself to be quite distracted by her as an instructor...she wears a turban and spends a lot of time explaining the chakras (thereby breaking up the workout, making it longer than necessary).  I wasn't into the chanting, either.  But the second time I tried the tape, I found I wasn't as distracted and I did enjoy the exercises as a whole.  The setting is beautiful, and the other participants are more 'normal' (i.e. no turbans).  I think if you can get past Gurutej's quirkiness, it's a good alternate yoga tape if you want something less demanding and more relaxing than Rodney Yee's or Bryan Kest's power yoga workouts.",1072828800,6,753,4.674242424242424
7885031,5,6305194726,"Kundalini yoga can be surprizingly difficult physically, and yet its primary goal is letting the practicioner experience themselves as a being of energy linked with all other energy. This series is minimally challenging physically, with a maximum of effectiveness at producing an energy experience. It is really powerful! I used to practice with a fabulous teacher named Thelma in Baltimore, and this is the closest thing I've found to being in her class since moving from there. Wonderful set, wonderful instruction!",1063324800,12,517,5.395061728395062
7885032,5,6305194726,"Some of the moves in this tape are taken from classic Hatha yoga, but some I did not recognize AS yoga, but this tape is not meant to be traditional yoga exercise.
It is a long tape and VERY introspective, which allows you to really sink into yourself and feel the moves.  Personal awareness is very important if you want to achieve spiritual and physical balance.
Some of the sounds make you feel awkward, and I'm sure they affect people in different ways, but for me they resonate right through me, which I believe is the desired effect.  Much like a tuning fork and a piano, they must surely eventually synchronize to put you in ""perfect tune!""",1015113600,6,647,4.521367521367521
