8530037,5,630301321X,"To say the absolute least this movie was by far the most suspense filled, chilling and exciting movie I have ever seen.  And believe me, I have seen my share!!!  I was searching the web to find the soundtrack because it is  awesome too if you enjoy sensual jazz!!! I first saw this movie in 1994  while living at home in Chicago.  It is now 1999 and I still get chills up  and down my spine just thinking about it!!! It's deep and it truly keeps  you on the edge of your seat from start to finish!!!  If I'm not  mistaken, I believe I cancelled a date to finish watching this movie.  Yes,  it was that good and well worth it...even though he was gorgeous! By the  way, did the actors receive any recognition at all for this movie?  And  please tell me how I can get the soundtrack, PRETTY PLEEEEEASE! I gotta'  have it!
Sincerely Submitted,
