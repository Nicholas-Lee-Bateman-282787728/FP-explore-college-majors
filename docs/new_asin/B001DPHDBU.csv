3535519,4,B001DPHDBU,"Look I don't think anyone can argue that season 7 was a great year for Scrubs. The show is AMAZING and the episodes this year WERE FUNNY but the continuity was completely jumbled, nothing made any sense and oh wait... Laverne was in the last few episodes. And she's dead. BLERG!

But... if you are genuinly considering buying season 7 then you probably have 1-6 and if you really have that, look me in the eye and tell me you aren't going to stick with the gang till the end.",1218931200,5,475,4.277777777777778

Even at the ""marked down"" Amazon price, this set won't be worth it. Season six had 22 episodes with a MSRP of 40 bucks and a pre-order from Amazon of 28.  That means this set should have an MSRP of 20 bucks and a pre-order from Amazon of 14 (not 20). Sorry, but the ""extras"" in the set don't warrant the extra six bucks (or the 10 bucks MSRP).

This is a show that will make you laugh and cry all in one episode. Every time we watched an episode we felt so connected to the characters. If your looking for a funny show that has a serious side this is definitely for you. I would definitely recommend this show.

Yes, because of that lovely (sarcasm!) writers strike, there are only eleven episodes in season seven.  Because of that, season seven should cost less than $20.  It should NOT be priced similar to other, complete seasons.

3535583,2,B001DPHDBU,"I have loved Scrubs since I first started watching it on DVD a few years ago.  I own every season and hadn't seen the 7th on TV - so I ordered it.  I was really disappointed.  I felt like the story lines were flat, I didn't care about any of the characters and their so called ""dilemmas"" - ie - Dr. Cox's wife goes out of town, JD as a Dad - SO far fetched, Elliot breaking up with Keith so she can conveniently get back together with JD at some time in the future of the show...

I thought it was not as funny either.  The jokes and characters are simply re-doing old jokes and shticks from season's past and they are getting old.

I have ordered season 8 so I'm hoping it will be a bit better.",1251158400,,695,3.964028776978417

3535585,3,B001DPHDBU,"At the end of seven years at Sacred Heart, wouldn't be about time that all the once-new interns grew up a little? Ah well, M*A*S*H went on for several times longer than the Korean War actually lasted, so much can be forgiven in the name of consistently screwball comedy seamlessly intermingled with truly poignant dramatic moments. This seventh season was truncated by the writers' strike, and there truly do seem to be some curious gaps in the overall story arc... stories left incomplete, and whole characters and situations that are essentially left hanging in mid-air, with only eleven episodes in the season. There are a couple of funny ongoing bits, never developed - the female intern with a voice so helium-high that the eternally sarcastic Dr. Cox doesn't even want to listen to her speak, and some off-again-on-again-off-again romance between an assortment of couples that seems to just fizzle into the off-position from lack of interest.

There was only one razzle-dazzle all-stops out and over the top episode; one of those which heads into the surreal for the entire length of the episode, instead of just momentary lurching in that direction.  ""My Princess"" - was told as a magical fairy tale sequence and appropriately showcased among the extra features as a ""making of"" sequence. Other extras included the obligatory alternate lines, deleted scenes and bloopers, most of which make you wonder why they weren't used instead, being at least as funny as what was included in the broadcast. Anyone who has followed the show from the first season will want this, just to round out the collection.",1243728000,,1607,5.01498127340824
3535586,5,B001DPHDBU,I absolutely love having all the seasons of scrubs.  They are perfect to watch or just have on for background noise.,1239667200,,116,4.523809523809524
3535587,4,B001DPHDBU,"I've loved Scrubs from the get-go. Its always been my favorite comedy on TV, and probably always will be. That being said, season seven was a disappointment...in a sense.

The season as a whole is good, with some major happenings. As for the DVD, the first disc is classic Scrubs. It's extremely funny and even has a few parts that get you thinking. The second disc is where things wander off. I understand the season was cut short due to the writers strike. I get that. But the second disc's episodes aren't that good. I can watch them, and yes I'll laugh, but it's not the Scrubs we all know and love. It's different.

I do like JD's progression from young inexperienced intern to older accomplished doctor/father. His transformation is one that has captivated me completely. Not to mention Turk and Carla's relationship. And is it just me or was it a mistake for them to be done with Elizabeth Banks? She was incredible in every episode she was in. Past that, it's business as usual at Sacred Heart.

As passable as this season was, it had THE WORST season finale (that really wasn't) ever. If you haven't seen it, Dr. Cox is telling his son a bedtime story, that of course features everyone at Sacred Heart. Minus a couple pretty good parts, it was a complete letdown that went against pretty much everything Scrubs is.

At the end of the day this IS Scrubs. So you can expect laughs. And if this is what we had to be given to get us to the eighth season--which is shaping up to be one of the best yet--I'll deal with it.",1238371200,,1525,4.435714285714286

3535595,3,B001DPHDBU,"I'm a huge fan of Scrubs and have every Season on DVD.  This is one of my favorite shows.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with Season 7.  A number of characters went through a personality change.  The deceased nurse Laverne was brought back as nurse Shirley.  JD's insecurity gave way to a focus on his immaturity.  Dr. Cox softened up and no longer intimidated the other doctors (except when choosing not to stick up for Dr. Kelso).  The Janitor lost his mystique, becoming more human and vulnerable.  The Todd became even more of a buffoon.  Dr. Kelso was relegated to one liners from the background and then eventually written out of the show.  Jordan developed into a whiny distraction.  A new intern - Josephine - was added as a truly annoying, one-dimensional character.

The good news: Background characters like Doug, Ted, Snoop Dog Attending, and Dr. Beardface were more relevant to the story lines.  The fairy tale episode was a good change of pace. (But did it really need to end on a sad note?).  Plus, there were some great one-liners and dream sequences, as usual.

Overall, season 7 was still pretty decent; it just doesn't stack up to the quality of past seasons.",1233878400,5,1191,4.741463414634146

It is not as punchy as Scrubs at its best being more caught up in storyline as the seasons progress but it is still a quality brand that continues to entertain.

It just felt different.
And WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT SEASON FINALE ALL ABOUT???!!!
It was completely out of order. They never showed how Dr Cox's baby was after the surgery. WHY was Dr Kelso still there when he retired 2 episode before? How can the almost kiss btwn JD and Elliot mean nothing when just the episode before Elliot was bonding with JD and his baby? Did the patient die or not??

I mean the last episode was hilarious as usual but I so hope season 8 ties the loose ends if there is one or at least make a movie to tie up the loose ends.

Also, the season 7 episodes were all over the place, a couple of them were even BAD.

Then there's the ""finale"".  What a piece of garbage that was.

And this is coming from a loooooooong time Scrubs fan who owns Season 1-6 on DVD.

I refuse to buy the heavily-messed-up season 7 on DVD unless ABC brings Scrubs back and gets it back on track.  If season 8 is actually released and they fix what NBC broke so badly, I'll re-consider the $20 for 7.",1226880000,2,569,4.165137614678899

3535626,4,B001DPHDBU,"Scrubs: The Complete Seventh Season is extremely short due to the writer's strike last year and the fact that NBC treated this show unfairly, this was supposed to be the final season of this muchly-ignored show and the network wouldn't let this darkhorse have a proper send-off. Luckily, ABC has picked up the show for mid-season and the loyal viewers will get a chance to say farewell to these goofy characters that has kept us entertained for seven years. Season 7 didn't get the royal treatment, barely any episodes but this season was just as good, I highly recommend it!",1222387200,,575,4.76
3535627,3,B001DPHDBU,"Scrubs will go down in history as being one of the last great American sit-coms and NBC's treatment of how it ended is shameful. It didn't go out with a bang or even a whimper, but rather with a far-off flushing sound. It reminds me a little of how ""Soap"" and ""Taxi"" ended, except this has even more depressing details.

And thanks to the fact that the writers hurried along Pam and Jim's relationship in ""The Office"", it looks like THAT show hasn't long to live either. Without that romantic tension anymore, it's going to evolve into a live-action version of ""Dilbert"" (if it hasn't already - I only saw a few episodes from the fourth season, but the mood HAS changed a lot compared to the last two seasons).

Thank God for the invention of DVD, though - at least I have BBC shows and Anime to entertain me 'til it's time to check out of this insane planet.

Thanks to Scrubs for so many great episodes and having a worldview I could relate to - you deserved a 'final season' at best, a special finale episode at least. All we fans can hope for is a DVD-release movie finale (""Firefly"" got one, and even Reno 911 had a movie made, so I can at least DREAM...)",1221523200,3,1160,4.3119266055045875

However, having already seen the whole season, I feel I can say a bit more than just ""it will be"" or ""it won't be"".  There are some unforgettable and life-altering episodes in this season, though it is short, such as the birth of JD's child, and the AMAZING fairy-tale episode, just to name two.  This season with its 11 episodes would be worth $50.  And if they charged that, I'd still buy it in a heartbeat!  Do yourself a favor, overlook the fact that its a short season, and buy it.

That being said, Season 7 wasn't all that good. Some episodes were great, but the low points of the season(most notably the episode that was aired as the series finale) were among the worst episodes in the entire series. A big problem with this season was with the network, rather than the show, as episodes were aired out of order, leading to continuity being all kinds of wrecked. Hopefully this is corrected for the DVD set, but there were a lot of other issues that stop this from being a great season.",1219622400,22,621,4.3076923076923075

I have to whole-heartedly disagree with a couple of the posts which said that the season was good though. I felt like a lot of the comedy (especially post strike) was very forced, and that's something that Scrubs has never had to do in my eyes. I agree that it was all over the place in many of the episodes and bringing the so-called Laverne look-alike, are you kidding??? Plus that had to be the MOST dismal attempt at a series finale that I have ever watched!!! A fantasy? They didn't tie anything together, the near-kiss with J.D. and Elliot (a most awesome ending to season 6) was never really even explored in the last season. AND they didn't even have J.D. and Elliot get together in the end!!! I understand not wanting to be a foregone conclusion but c'mon after 6 years of them together on and off and never being able to let go, to not have them get together in the end is just sinfully absurd...even Ross and Rachel knew they had to leave the audience with them at least trying to be together if they weren't going to be married! I keep telling myself that maybe the ""real"" series finale will be an extra on the DVD and they will make up for absolutely quitting on the show in the home stretch!",1219363200,4,1380,4.311538461538461
