8704954,3,B00UA86EWA,"If you watch the preview, you have the entire plot. Three Army Rangers kidnap President Bush (John Posey 2007 Iraq) and hold up in a kitchen where they interrogate him about the war and the real reason why we are over there. The film spoofs the major TV news networks rather nicely at the end of the film. It seems ANN or Al Jazeera had it right.

The film serves up dark comedy and cheese with its anti-war or anti-Iraq invasion. I thought the interrogation and answers they sought and got was poorly scripted weakening the theme to a point to where I was believing this was a pro war film spoofing the left...which it could have been.

I found the news network spoofs entertaining and the rest of the film mildly entertaining. Low budget. This is not a war film but a political statement for the left...I think.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. A little torture or enhanced interrogation techniques depending whether or not your last name is Cheney or not.",1445212800,,959,4.531791907514451
8704955,5,B00UA86EWA,"W.M.D. is proof that a low-budget film can be very effective, if it's carefully planned. The plot is genuinely suspenseful -- I intended to watch a half-hour and ended up finishing the DVD, wanting to find out what happens. Director/producer Richard Halpern uses his small cast to good effect, and the confined space works in favour of the story, becoming a claustrophobic trap. The desperation of the soldiers becomes apparent. As tension builds, we realize that one or more of the team may be untrustworthy. At first Captain Hank Garrison appears to have the advantage of surprise. But they're on a military base, in a foreign country far from home -- and this isolation makes it even more likely that things are going to go wrong. Will Garrison be able to restrain the dangerously-unstable Sergeant Downy in order to complete their mission? Will any of them get out of the situation alive?
I appreciated the plot twist at the end, and lead actor Tom Kiesche's performance as Garrison was compelling -- ably backed up by the alarming Weetus Cren, and John Posey as the President who isn't quite what he first seems. The behind-the-scenes extras were a nice bonus -- more than a lot of other independent film releases.",1432598400,3,1219,4.837320574162679
