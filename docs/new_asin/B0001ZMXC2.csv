2049780,3,B0001ZMXC2,"Directed by Irving Pichel, COLONEL EFFINGHAM'S RAID (aka ""Rebel Yell"" aka ""Everything's Peaches Down in Georgia"") (1946) features Charles Coburn, Joan Bennett, William Eythe, Allyn Joslyn, Donald Meek, Frank Craven, Thurston Hall, Cora Witherspoon and Emory Parnell.

Co-star William Eythe had Tyrone Power looks and excellent timing, career-wise. His arrival at FOX coincided with America's involvement in WWII, so the 4-F Eythe was given roles that Power might have had were he available. After he appeared in several major pictures it was clear that Eythe didn't have the talent to match his physical assets, plus loud whispers of a too-close friendship with Lon McCallister further hurt his career. McCallister also used his close relationship with openly gay director George Cukor to further his career. Meanwile to quell the rumors, Eythe married a socialite, but they were divorced a year later.

""Effingham"" marks the start of his precipitous slide from star into B and C pictures, then obscurity. Eythe turned to the bottle, endured several high profile arrests, and eventually died of acute hepatitis at age 38.

.
As for this little film, it vaguely reflects an America that, after years of isolationism, was gearing up for World War II.

Coburn is retired Army colonel Seaborn Effingham, who's back in Fredericksville, his small Southern hometown. When the colonel learns of the mayor's plan to rename Confederate Monument Square after a now deceased politician of questionable character, he convinces the editor of a struggling newspaper to let him write a regular column.

After Effingham's column becomes popular, he begins railing against the renaming idea. At a conference with the mayor, Effingham suggests a sprucing up of the square, rather than renaming it. The mayor's agreement to this is mere subterfuge, for he really wants to raze Fredericksville's lovely courthouse and build a sleek, new one. He calls for a public refurendum on this plan, hoping no one will attend, but Effingham's column alerts his fellow citizens and there's a major turnout at the meeting....",1402617600,2,2091,5.286144578313253

A pleasant but inconsequential comedy about an ex-military officer battling civic corruption in a small town in Georgia.  Charles Coburn turns in another of his blustery performances as the title character; lovely Joan Bennett co-stars in a small role as a sympathetic reporter; and William Eythe, an actor who played a few leads at Twentieth Century-Fox while Tyrone Power was serving in World War II, does a competent job as the noncommittal nephew finally spurred into activity by Coburn's example.  The supporting cast is a delightful mix of Fox's best contract players headed by Elizabeth Patterson and Donald Meek.  One curious thing about the film is that despite its Deep South setting, not one of the actors - not even star Coburn - ever bothers to attempt a Southern accent!

Despite its budget price, the Alpha DVD nonetheless offers above average audio and video quality.  There are a few jumps and bad splices in the print, but the picture is uniformly sharp with great contrast.  Worth a look for the attractive cast, ""Colonel Effingham's Raid"" is an agreeable way to fill a spare 70 minutes in your movie viewing schedule.",1110153600,10,1194,4.94

2049790,2,B0001ZMXC2,"""Colonel Effingham's Raid"" is a tedious talk fest celebrating small town America and a victory of the people over the politicians and big business.  Starring Charles Coburn, who had enjoyed a string of successes in comedy supporting roles, the film demonstrates that Coburn was really not capable of carrying a film and his ""act"" of the grouchy old man becomes very tiresome. The script is very ""talky"" and the talk is not interesting enough to sustain.  Supporting Coburn are Joan Bennett, completely wasted in a small role as a reporter and the talented William Eythe as Coburn's relation.  There is a good supporting cast of regular faces.

The film has been issued in the Fox Cinema Archives series which means it is expensive and has no extras, not even scene selection. The print is adequate but I would pass on this one.",1452643200,,827,4.802816901408451
