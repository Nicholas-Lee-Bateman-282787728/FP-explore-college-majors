7799885,5,1597990035,"DEAF people have a hard time of it: living in unavoidable cluelessness most of the time except when something is written and they have the time to try to read and understand it, or it is signed for them. Many are just barely literate for a variety of reasons but made exceedingly difficult because they are not able to hear the language around them and (as those who have ever tried to learn another language know) the written word is a slow, difficult and nearly impossible way to to gain fluency in any language. So here, in ASL, the language most of them understand best, is the most influential book in history, and one which is normally difficult to grasp because most often it is offered in KJV, archaic even to most hearing people, and nearly a third language to them. For the most part, the signers do an excellent job of presenting the concepts and accounts clearly and accurately in this visual language. Any Deaf person who struggles with reading the Bible or wants to know what it really says would benefit from watching this set.",1374451200,,1042,4.577540106951871
7799886,5,1597990035,"This is a great resource and would be helpful in a Bible Study.  It truly is ASL.  I used it to look at ideas on how to sign a passage of scripture I knew would be read in a church service.  There are a lot of expansion techniques used and can't it be ""copied"" for reading scripture in a church service.  There is not enough time for that, but it is helpful to see other ways to get a concept across that the interpreter might be stuck on.",1353110400,,439,3.9545454545454546
7799887,5,1597990035,I was satisftied with this vendor. It only took 1 week to recieve the shipment. The product was in great shape and it was for a reasonable price.,1343001600,,145,4.214285714285714
7799888,5,1597990035,"I can't believe it took so long for something like this to come out! The Bible in ASL (New Testament) is an awesome resource for the deaf/hard of hearing as well as anyone interested in American Sign Language. I enjoy reading the scriptures in my Bible and then watching how the signer puts it into ASL. This would also be very valuable to a church interpreter in trying to bring a scripture across from English to ASL. The scripture texts are displayed on the screen before the signer begins. Signs are clear and there are no outside distractions. Over all, I think the CD set was put together very well. I am anxious for the Old Testament to get completed so I can purchase it!",1310947200,4,679,4.44
