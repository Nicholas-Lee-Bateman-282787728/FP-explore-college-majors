8533879,4,B009191C6C,"It's a pretty good DVD. The first time I viewed it, didn't make as much sense as viewing it after I had some ANMA Japanese Massage training. Note: the pictures on the cover depict techniques covering the neck and shoulders. I would like to see those, but it is not what you get. This DVD covers techniques starting on the back and finishing at the feet.",1416700800,,353,4.363636363636363
