7688782,3,B01CQOVHOA,"Two of the movies were so-so, but two were fun enough to watch several times! However, both DVDs (two movies on each, and you don't have to turn them over) would not pick up where they left off if you had to stop watching and turn off the DVD player. I had to use the remote to open and close the tray before the DVD would load. Then it would pick up where it had been stopped. I thought it was just one DVD that was defective, but this was the case with both. Anyway, not a big deal; just a minor annoyance.",1488758400,5,508,3.941747572815534

You chose which movie you want to watch from the menu. Now sit back, munch your popcorn and enjoy! Oh, for the more sensitive viewers, you might get out a big box of tissues. These movies have ""those"" kind of moments.",1477267200,7,360,4.46969696969697
7688787,5,B01CQOVHOA,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favorite movie of the set as Jim Carrey delivered an astounding and mature performance for his role as Joel Barish. Will watch the movie again and again.,1476316800,2,197,4.6571428571428575
