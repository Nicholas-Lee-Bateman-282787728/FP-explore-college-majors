8306844,4,B001GS5RZ8,The quality of the production threw me off at the start but then quickly redeems itself with content. This is a great overall training tool. I have had some Muay Thai training which helped me assimilate into the drills with some ease. The one thing I would say about it is that some of the basics of punching and stepping are quickly over viewed which could get frusterating to some one just learning from the start. But overall I really appreciated the full spectrum of the training provided with this home study course. Well worth the investment!,1261180800,7,548,4.65979381443299
