7833857,4,6303012051,"When I read the plot summary for Being Two Isnt Easy, I thought it sounded great. A movie about a child, approaching his second birthday, told from the perspective of both him and his parents? It sounded pretty unique, and since it took place in Japan in the 60s, its definitely not the kind of movie that you see very often. It may mostly focus on the parents, but this is one of the more interesting films Ive seen this year, and one of the cutest. Its not cute in the sense that the child is doing all kinds of cute things, with funny situations or one-liners that make you go aww, but when Taro does narrate whats happening or what hes thinking, having it told from a toddlers point of view is a refreshing take, especially considering that Taro shares some pretty deep thoughts here and there.

As the title suggests, we follow the life of Taro, a little boy whos almost two years old, and his parents. His father has a typical office job, while his mother stays at home in their apartment with him. His parents love him very much, though the way they do things is quite different from how a lot of parents today would handle things (or maybe not). Things go well for the family at first- they're paying off bills, making due with what they have, and are all in good health from what we can tell. But things start to get a little rocky when Taros parents lose him at the zoo, and later on when he begins to get a very bad cough. Usually when something happens, its one of the parents that gets the blame, but the accuser quickly apologizes. Taros dad also gets news about a new living situation, where he and his family could live with his mother for a few years while his brother is out in another city for work reasons. Its a safe house, with no stairs that Taro could climb up, but living with grandma isn't all smiles for the family.

Being Two Isnt Easy, while taking place 50+ years ago, still has a lot of relatable situations that adults, and especially parents, can relate to. Have you ever been doing dishes or putting clothes away, only to notice that its awfully quiet, then found your child doing something they shouldnt, or they're somewhere they shouldnt be? Just seeing little Taro in some of these situations made me feel terrible for his parents. I don't want to ruin anything, but this isn't a dramatic movie (for the most part), and things often resolve quickly and in a nice manner. Still, no one ever wants to see a little kid playing on a balcony on the 2nd or 3rd story of a building, especially when the construction leave a lot to be desired.

The movie is mostly the parents show, with them talking to each other about regular things like having more kids, needing to make more money, and arguing about why Taro is getting sick so much, and whos fault it is, if anyones. Both actors have good chemistry, though they rarely show even the tiniest signs of affection for one another. Maybe it has to do with the time and location this was filmed (kinda like how they had to have separate beds for Lucy and Ricky on I Love Lucy), but you know what? I kind of liked that. Any other movie like this wouldve had the parents embracing each other after finding out their child is ok, and been predictable with the dialogue. While nothing game-changing, when someone starts to get chewed out for being irresponsible here, they really get it.

What won me over is Taros thoughts. We don't get nearly enough of these segments, but when they come up, they're always something to remember. This is what Taro tells the viewer when his grandma is convinced that he needs a shot instead of regular medicine, for his cough, and takes him back to the doctor, only to find out they're giving him another shot after the one he just received:

What does he mean by add? Cant you see Im crying from the pain? I can endure almost anything for a fire engine. But how can they take advantage of child psychology? My grandma tricked me. My parents love me. And I love my parents. But my parents try to force me to take bitter medicine. I won't trust grown-ups anymore.

Its cute, and yet something about that really got to me. Theres another part involving the moon, and later on, when they come back to it, that was one of the two big tear jerkers for me. I never saw either one of them coming.

This film isn't for everyone. Its mostly dialogue-driven, and almost plays out like a non-melodramatic soap opera in some ways. It also rarely has any intense moments where you're really worried about any of the characters. Even then, theres just something about this movie that makes it worth watching. Im very surprised that it doesnt have a regular, non-bootleg dvd release, or isn't even a part of the Criterion collection. For now, youll just have to stick with the streaming services or if you really want to be old school, go with the VHS copy. Its worth it whichever route you go.",1419552000,2,4890,4.432703003337041
