2449839,5,B000BZ8IC6,"Redwall is a huge hit in our house - both with the books and DVDs.  When we first got into Redwall several years ago, I had been told there was a cartoon series about it on PBS.  I looked for the VHS online (no DVDs available then).  I could find no sellers in the USA & had to buy from Canada.  One tape, with only a few episodes, was about $15 with shipping.  We got all of them (at that time there was only season 1).  My daughter wanted all of the episodes for Christmas, so I decided to go the DVD route (one DVD case takes up a lot less room than several VHS tapes) and replace all the VHS of season 1 with this DVD (actually, there are 2 discs in one case).  She also got season 2 (and will get season 3 for her birthday).

You will also notice there is also available ""Redwall the Movie"".  All that is, is season 1, edited down to an appropriate length for a movie.  Sure, it may be smoother viewing w/ no breaks in between episodes - but you miss a lot that is edited out.  Also, as a mother, I appreciate the shorter 20-30 minute episodes on the unedited season 1.  I think you can also get the season broke up into several DVDs - but it is cheaper to purchase all of the season at once.

My daughter who is 9 now, really enjoys these episodes & watches them frequently.  My son, who is now 13, has been reading the books for a few years (he devours them & rereads them frequently).  He says the episodes are pretty true to the books.  He did say there is the occasional added character (minor character), and some of the more gruesome scenes are edited for younger viewing.  (By the way, When I say 'gruesome', I do not mean like a horror movie.)

Redwall is an excellent series to watch or to read (my daughter will read them when she gets older - the size of the books intimidate her right now).  I am a very careful mother - what I mean by that is I try to screen what my children are exposed to until they have proper discernment of their own.  I found nothing objectionable in this series.  Yes, there is death (just like real life), & the episodes show it, but in a gentle sort of way.  In a way, these Redwall series remind me of the DVD version of ""Watership Down"", though not quite as serious.  Redwall has some humor, though I would not categorize it as a comedy.

Redwall is a GREAT series!  Not mind-numbing entertainment that seems so prevalent these days, unfortunately.",1168905600,37,2395,4.188183807439825
2449840,5,B000BZ8IC6,"If you a fan of the books, you will not be disappointed with the series.  Even if you never read the books, this 2 disc set stands strong on its own.  A wide variety of characters and a solid storyline makes this series fun for everyone.  My son and I ate up all the episodes within 2 days and it has become his favorite show to watch.  Highly recommended.",1168473600,6,356,4.115942028985507
2449841,5,B000BZ8IC6,"This is a fairly good adaptation of the Redwall series of books (edited slightly from the books, mainly to remove some more gruesome scenes).  This DVD isn't for young children as there are some characters killed in the series (though most deaths are off-screen).

Also the technical specs listed for this DVD are incorrect.  Currently the page lists that the DVD comes in English and Japanese and is closed-captioned.  This is not true.  The two DVDs are English only and there are no subtitles or closed-captions on either disk.",1154390400,20,530,4.910112359550562
2449842,5,B000BZ8IC6,"Our children all love this series.  If you are a stickler for having the video exactly mirror the book, then this may not be what you want, but our kids think it's great.",1151625600,8,170,4.151515151515151
2449843,5,B000BZ8IC6,"The Redwall book is brought to life in this amazing 2-disc DVD that features all the episodes in the first season.

2449864,5,B000BZ8IC6,I love this show. Watched Season 1 when I had Amazon Prime two or three years ago. Now that Season 2 is available I subscribed to Amazon Prime again. Only I can't watch any of these at all. Not sure why they're not allowing me to watch.,1474675200,,236,4.042553191489362

2449867,5,B000BZ8IC6,"Redwall:  Season One (Episodes 1 through 13) essentially follows the events of the Brian Jacques fantasy novel Redwall.  Both the book and the television series tell the story of how Matthias acquires the sword of Martin the Warrior and the series of challenges he faces to that end.  Matthias is a mouse and is one of many peaceful animals dwelling at Redwall Abbey.  However, when Cluny the Scourge (a Sea Rat) attacks Redwall, the peaceful animals unite and fight against oppression.  Over time, other animals join the forces of Redwall and ultimately defeat Cluny.  The video series adds medieval style music to the soundtrack and really brings the book to life.  Additionally, each episode opens and closes with the images of the Redwall tapestry; much like the Bayeux Tapestry of the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the Redwall tapestry summarizes the history of the main events of Redwall Abbey by using pictures of key people and events.  Though the television version differs slightly in some details from the book, I thoroughly enjoyed both the book and video adaptation of this great fantasy epic.  Highly recommended.",1468195200,,1125,5.037837837837838

2449869,5,B000BZ8IC6,"My kids have loved this since it was on TV. When they stopped running them, we had to buy it!",1464048000,,93,3.7
2449870,4,B000BZ8IC6,"This was the first time I'd seen books I loved be adapted to film.

While many pieces were missing, the show still tells Brian Jacques story with the same charm and character that made the novel successful.

While the Redwall stories can be intense for younger people, the show portrays the violence quickly while still following the novels.

I thought this was surprising given the G rating but I thought this was good, since the action was part of  what made Redwall interesting as a young adult.

4/5 for being awesome, if not universal.",1463788800,2,540,4.702127659574468
2449871,5,B000BZ8IC6,I fell in instant love with the characters in the Redwall series. The movies make it easier for the smaller children to identify with the characters and be entertained. I love the books. I'm hosting a summer read along in my doll club and several of our membership have already ordered their copies of Redwall. I'm happy to be able to introduce more readers to this wonderful series by Brian Jacques.,1462924800,,400,4.647887323943662
2449872,5,B000BZ8IC6,Redwall was a beautiful series. I just don't understand why more animation is not made like this. Takes you from one adventure to another in a world that is wonderfully adorable.,1440720000,2,178,4.774193548387097

2449901,5,B000BZ8IC6,"My 9 year old daughter really enjoys this animated series. She loves that is it about animals, the characters are fun or evil or silly or noble. Much better than the branded animated junk out there I say.",1428969600,2,204,4.394736842105263

2449903,5,B000BZ8IC6,"This is an excellent rendition of the books! One of my favorite shows as a child (and now :)...The only part that bugs me (of course) is how the shows change some details, even adding new characters in. While this does provide some backstory without the obvious ""telling"" approach, if you'd never read the books before it could change the whole aspect for you.",1424390400,,360,4.640625

2449906,3,B000BZ8IC6,My roommate and I are reading the series and thought it wiuld be fun to check out the cartoon to see how it would look outside our imaginations...while the drawing style wasn't bad the way they adapted it was rough and overall we decided that our imaginations were better.,1393200000,,272,4.571428571428571
2449907,5,B000BZ8IC6,"Redwall is a great adventure story for children of any age (Adults, too!  I didn't pick up my first Redwall book until I was 18!)  If you liked the book, this is a wonderful adaptation of the book into a television series.

There are some slight differences between the book and the television show, mostly additions that did not appear in the original story, but I expect that was probably just a way of fitting the story into an entire season - and the changes are not harmful to the story.

Only one small word of warning: Redwall may not be appropriate for very young children.  The villain of the story presents a somewhat frightening image, and there is some death in the show.  But if you like the novels of Brian Jacques, or if you have never picked up a Redwall book in your life, this is a wonderful show for the family to watch, and a great adventure.",1206576000,2,862,4.35625

8094611,5,B000BZ8IC6,1st of 2 seasons.  Was the favorite of a friend's son.  Once he started watching he couldn't get enough.  There is violence but nothing like modern cartoons or even most older shows.,1500249600,,182,4.625
8094612,5,B000BZ8IC6,"As a girl I read Redwall and loved the story as well as the name Matthias. I kept the name in mind if I ever had a child and today, many years later my son Mathias (I opted for the simpler spelling) is watching Redwall with me and enjoying it. Pretty happy over here",1492646400,,266,3.9444444444444446
