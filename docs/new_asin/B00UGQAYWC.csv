8706355,5,B00UGQAYWC,"I truly loved seeing two real-life sisters (Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen) acting together!  They are two of my favorite actresses.  Every time I show this DVD to people, they love it and ask me where I purchased it.  Its a fun teleplay without sex, foul language, or violence.  Classic!  I watch it every so often.  (I also saw the play in a local theatre that had a slightly different ending.)  I also purchased this DVD for my sister and 90-year-old mother.  They loved it as well.",1511481600,,487,4.517241379310345
