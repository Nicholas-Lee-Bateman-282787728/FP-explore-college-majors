8155743,5,B000KD52H8,"This is just pure hilarity. Nothing is better than some fellow Republicans like Dean Martin, Bob Hope, John Wayne, and RONALD REAGAN palling around and cutting up in the VERY FIRST episode of the roasts, with the soon-to-be President as the Man of the Hour. Reagan really had a wonderful wit, not to mention Dino, who, in my opinion, is truly the funniest man to live. There are a few people thrown in by NBC and the producer as fillers, but they're just as funny as the others. Flip Wilson makes a remark about Nipsey Russell that makes some jaws drop and wild laughter ensue. We also get so see John Wayne on location for ""Rooster Cogburn"", which is a real treat, not to mention his comments being gut-busting.

This is good entertainment, which is not found today. Most people remark about this sort of thing being clean, and while, by comparison, it is very clean, but the ""naughty"" innuendos are a million times funnier than any nasty ""comedy"" we see today.

This is tape is a million times better than the DVD version (you can't hear the DVDs well for some odd reason). For the price, you can't watch anything better.",1187827200,6,1123,4.554455445544554
