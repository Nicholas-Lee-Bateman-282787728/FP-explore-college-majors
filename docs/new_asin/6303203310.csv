603090,5,6303203310,I was very happy with my purchase.  It was in excellent condition and was a resonable price.  Will purchase again from this site.,1224806400,,129,4.565217391304348
603091,4,6303203310,"""Night and the City"" ""Dragnet"" even ""Deadline USA""(the Bogart film) this is a somewhat overblown ""Real  Life"" look at the lives of the people that make up a big city  newspaper from the era when even women,were called newspaper men. What these  people have to go through to get the news out,how it effects their lives. It  attempts to give insight to the personal lives of these people as well. Jack  webb the editor who is strapped with a V.I.P tour during a hot news day. His  loving but world worn wife,played by Meredith Baxter's real life Mom(look  her name up in the credits good trivia),William Conrad as the cynical  reporter who is trying to turn copy boy David(Ozzie's kid)Nelson in to a  newspaper man and a solid who's who of character people,who will grab you  in, keep you going, and let down softly at the end. I never get tired of  watching this one from the first time I saw it in a theater. You'll  remember this one too I think It'll kinda get to you,a little,and might  make you smile.",966038400,7,1005,4.456043956043956
603092,4,6303203310,"If you want to see some very famous stars at an early age this is the movie for you.  Jack Webb is more human than his Joe Friday, William Conrad is excellent as the city desk editor.  This movie is loaded with  ""future stars"" giving a top notch performance.  The plot is a  little clunky, but the actors really make the movie.  This is one for  everyones tape library.  This movie is seldom seen on tv.",953078400,9,403,4.2105263157894735

603184,5,6303203310,"A little hokey, pretty corny, and incredibly entertaining !
We watched this whenever it turned up on late-night tv, always hoping that it would someday be available on disc.
We weren't disappointed !",1427241600,,199,5.0606060606060606

603187,5,6303203310,"Video vhs tape arrived in perfect conition. Unfortunately, --30-- with Jack Webb and cast is one stinko film. No entertainment value at all and no insight into the working of a newspaper and meeting it's deadline. In fact, this movie flatlines within the first 10 minutes.",1419638400,,272,4.934782608695652

603190,2,6303203310,"Hilarious camp classic from producer-director-star Jack Webb, who takes the ""Dragnet"" approach to daily newspaper life. When David Nelson appears as a bongo-playing copy boy, ""-30-"" loses any shred of credibility. At least Webb is more animated than usual. William Conrad chomps the scenery with gusto as the city editor. Never boring, never remotely believable.",1394323200,,362,5.6
603191,3,6303203310,"I finished this tonight. Jack Webb tried to do for newspapers what he did for the police on ""Dragnet"" here. The odd title ""-30-"" is used in the newspaper business to mean ""the end"". I think the title probably hurt the movie. It's almost like ""Airport"" set in a newspaper room. Jack Webb (who also produced and directed) is the managing editor and he and his staff work late to get out the morning edition. What seems like a slow news night suddenly changes as a couple big stories break- most notably a little girl lost underground in the rapidly flooding sewers. By the end many of the principal cast members lives have changed. The cast is odd. William ""Cannon"" Conrad is a loud sarcastic editor always feuding with David Nelson who has a bongo number in the middle of the movie. Also onhand in the newspaper are Joe Flynn and Richard Deacon! The sound track reminded me of the ""Ya ya"" song from Lolita. It's an oddity but not completely horrible and worthwhile for Jack Webb fans!",1391126400,,983,4.52808988764045
603192,5,6303203310,this was a very good movie and Jack Webb is a wonderful actor and its great that you can find good classic movies like this on Amazon.,1390694400,,134,4.0
603243,5,6303203310,"Newsroom drama ala Webb and other someday big stars, including Joe Flynn and William (voice of Superman on radio, detective Cannon on TV William Conrad.) It's good to see Webb in a different role with some different human dimensions.",1388448000,,233,5.0
603244,5,6303203310,Many old favorite actors plus a great human side performance by Jack Webb.  A treat to be able to find this little jewel.,1379289600,,121,4.260869565217392
603245,5,6303203310,"The story of an overnight shift at a newspaper,filled with tension and humor. There's some funperform

The story of a night shift at a newspaper and how the news stories affect those who report the stories. Fun performances by minor character actors that everyone over 50 will recognize,",1377388800,,287,4.979166666666667
603246,3,6303203310,"The best part of this film in the real behind the scenes leg work, manpower and technology that was used to create newspapers in the pre- digital era, including the use of what now would be described as a fax machine which transmitted photos via wire. The film is a great showcase for many solid character actors of the era, especially William Conrad who clearly enjoys himself in his role. but the 2 major dramatic plots are disappointing. Still if you enjoy Jack Webb's acting, this is a decent movie.",1370649600,4,503,4.6
603247,5,6303203310,Good quality and sound. Not in color- but you don't miss that. Interesting how a newspaper decides on a story and what it takes to get it in final print.,1365811200,,153,4.133333333333334
603248,3,6303203310,"Interesting for anyone who remembers Jack Webb and Dragnet, but pretty dull stuff now. No one remembers this movie. See it and you will understand why.",1354406400,,151,4.846153846153846
603249,5,6303203310,"I grew up watching the leads playing much different characters on television.  This movie defied every notion I had of the actors and the newsroom formula film.  It was surprising in its building of plot and characters.  It was light-weight, almost comedic at times, heartbreaking and human at others. From Webb's upbeat character who is happily married but still haunted by the loss of a wife and child...to the senior writer who waits for news of her pilot grandson, the movie is build on real emotions and characters.  The at times silly rapport of a team of co-workers is balanced with the tension and sorrow of the news they must cover.  It doesn't matter they are shown working against the clock, pecking away at their typewriters and cutting and pasting their page, the movie is timeless. There is a real- time feel to the film. I really, really liked it.",1327968000,2,862,4.72
603250,4,6303203310,"This is another Jack Webb film. He and a long list of reasonably well known actors recreate the night shift at a major city newspaper in the 1960s. The pace of the film is very fast which plays into the speed of the news. The script weaves all sorts of stories and characters together in a very good way. It uses the news stories to introduce all sorts of characters who come on screen and then are gone. Its much more light-hearted (with some exceptions) than Webb's usual fare.

As with most of Webb's work, the film is obsessed with re-creation, detail and human interest stories. The technical people working at the newspaper even get covered (which I can't ever remember another film doing). William Conrad gives a good performance running the newsroom. It would have been better if the story had gone beyond the newsroom to see various people at work. But its still not a bad little movie from that era.",1327881600,,909,4.576687116564417
603251,5,6303203310,"Jack Webb at his finest!  Jack Webb delivers one of his best roles that both fascinates and brings out the man behind the newspaper business first hand.
Also starring William Conrad(Cannon)and Joe Flynn (McHale's Navy) and Richard Deacon (The Dick Van Dyke Show), and other all star...stars of their day to bring to the audience not only what a newspaper goes through, but also the heart wrenching things that they have to report on.
Once you see this movie, you will want to take it out four to five times a year to experience the moments only veterans actors can give that will move you.",1303603200,6,589,4.609523809523809
603252,5,6303203310,"I didn't even think the movie I ordered would be available anywhere, but this seller had it on VHS.  The product was brand new, just as advertised, and arrived quite promptly.  I'd be happy to purchase more items from this Amazon seller.  Thanks!",1278633600,,246,4.674418604651163

7841469,3,6303203310,"Jack Webb directed and starred in this. About newspaper people and their stories end with -30-. He acts like Dragnet role and David Nelson, brother of Rick also stars in it. It is a collectible and hard to find. Actually I end all of my emails with -30- It is a remastered print for DVD too.",1515715200,,291,4.214285714285714
7841470,4,6303203310,"Jack Webb is his usual cryptic, staccato speaking self.  William Conrad is terrific as the night editor.  This is a slice of life movie in the city newsroom over sixteen or so hours.  The characters must deal with personal issues and still get the paper out on time.  Oh, yes - David Nelson is in this movie as a rookie harassed by Conrad.",1513987200,,339,4.333333333333333
7841471,3,6303203310,I like Jack Webb but this movie was boring. I hung in there until the end but it was rough.,1503014400,,91,3.6

7841473,5,6303203310,"I saw this on a late night movie spot on one of our local channels and was impressed.  This isn't the Jack Webb you remember from the movie ""The D.I."" nor is it Joe Friday from Dragnet.  It details the inner workings of a newspaper as it searches the city for a young boy thought swept away to the city sewers by a torrential rainstorm.  Great acting with Robert Conrad (Cannon) helping to round out the cast.  Very good thriller!",1471305600,,430,4.3375
7841474,5,6303203310,Still need Pete Kelly's Blues to complete the JW films.  They can keep The Last Time I Saw Archie.  -30- highly recommended despite the soap opera.,1456876800,,147,4.615384615384615
7841475,5,6303203310,"Like other reviewers have said, I think -30- is a little corny in places. But its suspenseful; I loved it when I first saw it as a kid and still like it today.  I first saw the film about 50 years ago and as a 10-11 year old, it captured my interest in a journalism career. I didn't become a journalist, but I've done quite a bit of writing nonetheless. Very entertaining.",1453420800,,372,4.166666666666667
7841476,3,6303203310,The only problem I had with this dvd was the audio. It was recorded at a very low level and I had to turn the audio on the television all the way up. When the music play or certain parts of the movie it was extremely loud and at other times it was barely audible. I can't complain though I received them quicker than I excpected.,1447977600,,329,4.0
7841477,5,6303203310,"Okay. Most people would take one look at this and say, ""Oh it's got Jack Webb in it; he's probably just as unemotional in this as he was in Dragnet and that's gonna drag down the whole picture."" Honestly, I was a little concerned, even though I have enjoyed other Webb driven films like The D. I. and Pete Kelley's Blues, but 30 was blessed of a great cast, an engaging plot, and a surprising stab at emotion driven acting by Jack Webb that honestly had me in tears there at the end.
  There are several stories to follow along with in this film, the setting is a newspaper office after all. Each one makes you care about it, a lot, and I must say, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I also enjoyed the heck out of every scene involving William Conrad, who seemed to give Webb someone to have a great ball of fun with. Even alone, Conrad was a joy to watch with all his caustic comments and sarcastic attitude. He even managed to deliver the greatest speech defending journalism that I've ever heard.
  Great film, worth the buy.",1436486400,3,1047,4.2727272727272725
