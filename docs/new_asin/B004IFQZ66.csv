Unfortunately, the main female character becomes revolting, having no backbone whatsoever. The guy she likes is a jerk and doesn't change much throughout the movie. How he could like such a female with no pride in herself. She acts like a child being disciplined by a parent in front of the guy, and he acts like an arrogant, domineering parent. He's kind of a sicko, who probably gets off on the power trip. On top of that, he treated his first fiance with courtesy and gentlemanly manners. But he treats his second fiance like a child. In my book, he is scum.",1371254400,,659,4.546218487394958

I looked forward to seeing him smile and I could feel the growing attachment between the leading characters.
I would highly recommend this drama to other viewers.
It's a beautiful love story.",1302652800,7,391,4.52112676056338
