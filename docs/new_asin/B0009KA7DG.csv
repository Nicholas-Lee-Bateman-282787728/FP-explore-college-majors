8062641,5,B0009KA7DG,"This documentary was screened in my film class and when it ended, there was a heavy silence in the room. Several people wiped their eyes. It's a powerful film that shows how isolated life is for those who are blind and deaf, which many people may not be able to imagine. Herzog captures this with honesty and compassion. My admiration for Herzog became awe after watching this film and I bought it to share with my family and friends.  At the very least, it inspires gratitude for the gifts of sight and sound and an awareness of what life might be like without them.",1340409600,3,567,4.451923076923077
8062642,5,B0009KA7DG,"As a huge Werner Herzog fan I was very very touched by this DVD. How Werner Herzog -who strikes me  as an iron man with an iron will- manages to search and find such touching subjects for his movies and documentaries is far beyond my understanding...
The line in which the old lady says that in the moment the person let go her hand she feels ""hundreads od miles away"" (they speak with the blind/deaf people trough a complex alphabet in which the palm of the hand is crossed and touched by the interpreter's finger) is enough to make you cry...
Also her description that the deaf person often hears annoying sounds all the time and the blind person sees patterns of colour was a cruel revelation for me. Some of the characters are born blind and deaf and some others became impaired by some accident. Despite our personal problems -that we all have- this movie can put the sensitive listener into a very humane perpective. Forgive some mistake in English and the preaching tone, but I was really speechless after i watched it. It is worth every cent!!!",1304380800,5,1052,4.5661375661375665
8062643,4,B0009KA7DG,"Herzog said in an interview that he made this for 3,000 dollars.  He then said that everyone should make at least one film.  I can't make this particular film, but I wish I had. This is something that anyone and everyone can learn something from. Communication is something we would all be lost without. And that alone is something worth considering.",1290470400,,350,4.721311475409836
8062644,4,B0009KA7DG,"I'm no different from you is a reccuring line you'll here throughout the film as Fini Straubinger (who I guess would come closest to being the protagonist) tries to connect with other deaf & blind handicaps. Yet that same line is something that struck me strongly as I noticed how certain myths and preconceptions about the deaf & blind were brought to light by the film. They were truly no different from you or I despite the handicap they had. In fact the only thing that really held these people back from living normally was society and even family. Overall the film was very informative to say at the least, it's best to watch this viewing experience brought by Werner Herzog yourself and see a different side to the Land of Darkness and Silence.",1179532800,4,751,4.611940298507463
8062645,5,B0009KA7DG,"Werner Herzog is famous for his movies about obssesive maniacs (Aguirre, Fitzcarraldo, etc.). However, it turns out that he has a great sensibility for documentary films. Although this movie is not for everyone -it has a very slow narrative- it is a very important testimony of those people who have lived in the land of darkness (blindness) and silence (deafness). It shows, amongst many other things, how these people live, how they ""see"" the world (notice how language falls apart here)and how they communicate. A word of advice: there is a shot of a poor child who was born deaf and blind and lived in isolation for several years (imagine a person who has not developed linguistic skills at all). That is one frightening and sordid scene that will give you nightmares.

I have a weird obsession with documentaries and love this film; however, if you're not into this genre you may want to rent the dvd first.",1162080000,8,912,4.772151898734177
