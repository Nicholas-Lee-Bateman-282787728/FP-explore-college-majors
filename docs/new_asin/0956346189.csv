7793638,5,0956346189,I bought this for my husband. I am a beginner & I liked it. My husband shoots sporting clays & he also liked it. Many good tips in the video. Well produced. John King is a good instructor. Great for beginners & even people who shoot can pick up some tips. There was a nice flow to this video.,1451952000,,292,3.9661016949152543
7793639,1,0956346189,"If you have never shot a shotgun at a moving target this video may be for you, otherwise not so much. Begins with the mandatory opening with a discussion about gun handling and safety and the difference between 20 and 28 gauge shells. Under the chapter, ""Equipment"" you will find out that you need a gun, shooting glasses and ear plugs or muffs to shoot clays - that's helpful. There is also a little vignette on clothes for the clays shooter for those who want to be fashionable as opposed to jumping into some jeans and a t-shirt. Lots of gushing by the two students about how wonderful King and shooting - in that order - are.

Basically, all you will learn from this video is that King is a devotee of the pull-away method - he calls it ""push."" You can learn as much about pull-away by just typing the words into Google as you will from this video. You can tell that King is a very nice man and if he made another video - this time for intermediate or experience shooters - you might learn something worthwhile. Until the, save the 59 bucks and spend it on shells.",1398643200,,1068,4.313432835820896
7793640,5,0956346189,"Well produced and entertaining approach.  Mr. King illustrates a clear progression of skills with two students.  I was uncertain about the approach but found that the combination of didactics and personality works.  I would like to see his next, more advanced lessons.  He really inspired confidence and excitement with the sport.",1395619200,,330,5.411764705882353

Five stars.  I just wish I could get lessons from him.",1344643200,,284,4.017857142857143
