8054656,5,B0007ZD77Q,"I have watched most of Salman's movies and usually don't see chemistry with his leading ladies, but this film seemed the exception. The music was beautiful. Scenery was fab and all co-stars were real. I thought this an underrated film. The leading lady was young, but her performance matched Salmans'. I enjoyed this movie.",1358467200,,323,5.0

Now I have the movie and I've already watched it four times since Christmas! I am SO happy that the search for this movie has come to an end :D Thank You!",1356566400,,279,4.090909090909091

PLOT
Starts out with several High school seniors doing an uninspiring dance number that spills out into the street. They are drooling over an older graduate that's been gone for awhile but is still coming to Russia because of his father the Indian Ambassador. Lucky is shown as a good student trying to study for her exams and not really sure who they are talking about but in the long run joins in the fun of the moment like her peers.  Lucky's father is in the foreign service as well and on the way to do her finals for graduation she has a flat tire on her bike. A evil guy in a trailer tries to drag her inside and attack her but she hits him with her tiffin and gets away. He starts to chase her and she, searching for a place to hide ends up in Salu's car under a blanket in the back seat. The attacker tries to break into Salmans car and get's his ass kicked. The next thing Salman knows he's at a Russian road block due to rebels in the area and he finds he's hiding a stowaway...whoops...let the war begin..real one. Rockets are launching , cars are exploding .It's time to get the heck out of dodge . Lucky and Salman are bought together by survival circumstances and are cut off from their families without passports or money. The only thing they do have is a vintage sports car that Salman is very attached to. He drove it up to Russia instead of flying..not my first choice for a place to drive a vintage car but it's still a fun story addition.

 This is a fairly realistic well paced film that was entertaining and spiced with some beautiful costume dance numbers and some pleasant songs . Nothing earth shattering but a fun way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day. Do Keep in mind this is a 20 year old Hindi actress playing a High school senior. She's quite stunning. They said in an article that she looked like Aishwarya Rai but personally I didn't see any resemblance at all. Do not look for excellent acting or dancing from her, she was just getting started in her career and does passably well as a pampered school girl thrown into the middle of a regional terrorist vs army war.  The character Lucky is a girl who has never been away from home a single night in her life. Seventeen year old teenagers always like to see themselves as strong and independent but the majority of the pampered middle class ones typically go running to their parents when something scary pops up . To the average parent or an older twenty something's the teen portrayal will seem pretty close to accurate in their own experiences. Salman takes care of her somewhat and she takes care of him somewhat. She is shown having some pretty good inner strength in the end. She's bonded with him and he's hers. She's not going to leave him to die . Back she goes.

 This one's a quickie at 2hours and 2o min and will be over before you know it. I've watched it three times already. I'm a sucker for a romance novel with pretty music and some action scenes.  It'a  a keeper for Romance via action junkies. Bought this for around 6 bucks and free delivery with Amazon prime.",1336089600,2,3222,4.319536423841059
8054660,5,B0007ZD77Q,"I think this movie is so good . It is romantic, and I am so glad I bought it. I would say any one who is a romantic should see this movie. I am not fond of the sub titles but I am into Bollywood movies.",1299801600,5,202,3.4130434782608696
8054661,5,B0007ZD77Q,"I know the movie did not do very well in the box office but I think that is where people went grossly wrong. The Indian audience love action and melodrama which was lacking in this film. This is one of best subtlety romantic flicks that the Indian Film Industry has come up with it. The script is fantastic and the music more so. Salman Khan is at his charming best as Adi with cute Sneha (who frankly is more of a natural beauty that Aishwarya Rai these days). There is little focus on the age gap but it is there, subtle and sexy. In reality their age gap is about 22 years but you cannot tell at all because Salman Khan just does not age!

Highly recommended for the romantics out there. Also the cinematography is this film is just incredible. Russian Indian life is very well researched and depicted through Kader Khan. The comedy by Mithunda could have been cut out but overall this is a gem of a film.",1289433600,12,908,4.309941520467836
8054662,4,B0007ZD77Q,"DVD quality much better than the first release. An action-packed tale of love amid great strife in a distant country. Although it is the first time for Sneha in a movie, she did a credible job as a shy high school girl caught during a terrorist uprising. Superb camera work and scenery. Truly melodic, yet modern music and lyrics. Unfortunate that Salman could not respond just a bit more instead of in just the dream sequences. One major annoyance was the advertising in the black areas during the musical numbers. Very distractful and distasteful.",1230336000,4,549,4.851063829787234
