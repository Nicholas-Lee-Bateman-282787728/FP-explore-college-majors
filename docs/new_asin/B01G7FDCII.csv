8762458,5,B01G7FDCII,This is a great video to learn about my camera. It has everything I needed to be advanced in my photography. I wish I could download the same contents into iTunes so I can review it on my iPad. Maybe I will buy it again as a download.,1515196800,,234,3.8958333333333335

8762460,5,B01G7FDCII,"This dvd is so great actually!! I actually got this camera just now and loved having a DVD directly about the camera itself. I'm actually also about to take a college intro to photography class.  While the college classes are great I actually think this teacher will go into more detail in the DVD than a college class will.  I'm very pleased at the detail and the amount of detail put into the class.  Also the way he explains things is really really good.  Well worth the money even if you know a lot about photography!!
Also there are tips in this DVD that even someone that can use the camera they wouldnt know without it.  Well worth the money!!",1483574400,,650,4.383333333333334
8762461,5,B01G7FDCII,"This crash course for the A6300 was amazing! I sat down with a cup of coffee and my camera and after watching it, I was comfortable knowing how to control my camera. There is so much information its tough to remember it all. So I'll be watching it again. It is truly for beginners like me who want to learn how to use their camera. But it explains more than that. It also explains the basics of photography so you not only learn how to use the camera but how to take better pictures. It has helped me so much! To learn all the things included in this dvd on my own would have taken me months, but now I have it in a 4 hour video that I can go back to at any time.",1465171200,5,663,3.8823529411764706
