8069776,5,B0009XT7ZC,"I don't know how I missed this documentary from PBS. Only 59 minutes but a real keeper for James Dean fans. I knew some of the people in it and saw how they and I, as well, have morphed into Senior citizens. Corey Allen, deceased.  Bill Bast, still alive, as well as other people, photographers who took the famous photos of Jimmy were interviewed. Also now deceased. But, were alive to be in this documentary. Corey is gone too, as well, as Natalie, Nick Adams, Dennis Hopper and Nicholas Ray, and they aren't all in this documentary. But the ones still alive had a lot of things to say about Jimmy. They told a lot of things never written in books. He's been gone 55 years, and still is an Icon. Not as many fans left, from 1955 when he died. But, there are a few new fans who still read about who James Dean was and what was he like to have been remembered all of these years. It is worth having this DVD and it is on Amazon too.",1411171200,5,932,4.149171270718232
8069777,5,B0009XT7ZC,"Another great tribute to a star...gone before his time. This dvd runs 53-minutes and it's in color & black and white. It's a very,very well done tribute...only if you are a JAMES DEAN fan...as I am still today. I was 15 when he died..now..so many decades later..he's still remember as ""THE REBEL......WITH A CAUSE"".Pick it up..it's worth the money to add to your collection. It's about his very last year before his death...with the making of all three classics in one year. GIANT was made in 1955...not 1956...it was release a year after his death in 1956. All three of his movies..were made in late 1954..into September of 1955. Catch it..you will like it. AMERICAN MASTERS..did a great tribute to him. Thankyou.  Till later.  Jack",1371686400,8,733,4.856
8069778,5,B0009XT7ZC,"This is wonderful for a true fan.  Interviews with people who actually knew and cared for Jimmy Dean, great footage.  It's clear those involved in the production really tried their best. Great buy, I'll treasure it forever.",1305590400,10,223,5.0
8069779,4,B0009XT7ZC,"If you are a James Dean fan this dvd is worth viewing. It is a candid perception from people who knew him, such as Martin Landau. It also gives a sense of the time in which he lived, the mid 1950's.",1236643200,18,198,3.8536585365853657
8069780,5,B0009XT7ZC,"This DVD is well paced, well made and informative for the individual who is new to the history of James Dean.  I enjoyed the tone and visual aesthetic of this DVD and thought it fair and slightly sentimental (in a positive manner) on the subject of the man behind the persona.  It concentrates on his 3 films and of his search for artistic freedom, and the overwhelming will of his free spirit.  This DVD only interviewed those who actually knew James Dean, instead of a third party he said, she said situation.  There is no question that these people interviewed cared deeply for him.  I took away that James Dean was a maven of artistry in all forms, that he maintained a true understanding of people and life and that he was a contradictory, tender, and strong human being--almost beyond himself.  A very nice hour spent!",1198886400,34,824,4.609589041095891
