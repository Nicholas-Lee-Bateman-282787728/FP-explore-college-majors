8661072,4,B00KRPADW8,"Nice movie.  The trailer was lousy, so I was expecting to see a dark character show up (probably Jake Weber's character), but that didn't happen.  While the main characters are the women (Tess and Anna) and their struggles with their pasts, the male characters have struggles as well which are interesting.  The characters, (Tess and Anna) personal struggles with the tragedy of their lives affects the relationships they have with John (Tess's squeeze) and David (spouse of Anna).  So it is also a movie about relationships and it is done fairly well.  There is also a bit of that ""mystical"" healing BS that I have never bought into, presented in kind of a dream sequence for the most part, somewhat bizarrely.  That didn't detract too much as the movie is paced pretty well. However I had to turn on closed captioning because the dialogue at times was difficult to decipher.  A fault of the editing?  I didn't rate it higher because as a gun and horse owner, I felt the screenwriter lacked a hell of lot of knowledge about either subject.  Both guns and horses figured prominently in each woman's past so I thought the treatment should have had more realism.  Bought it on Amazon Prime.",1405382400,2,1188,4.723300970873787
