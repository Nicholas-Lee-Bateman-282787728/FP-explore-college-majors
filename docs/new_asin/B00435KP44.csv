4253638,5,B00435KP44,I met Edie on an Olivia trip and she is an amazing woman.  The film lets you see what unconditional love is all about.  Keep up the good fight for equality Edie!,1362528000,2,161,4.0
4253639,5,B00435KP44,"So clear that marriage equality is about love and commitment.  These 2 women lived their lives dedicated to each other.  The film is romantic, funny, inspiring and made us cry.",1361318400,2,176,4.833333333333333
4253640,5,B00435KP44,A very well done movie with a beautiful and important story.  I am most pleased to own my personal copy.,1358208000,2,104,4.2
4253641,5,B00435KP44,It was heartwarming. We loved it! So sad yet inspiring and endearing. I hope the court case turns in favor of Edie!,1357862400,2,115,4.2727272727272725
4253642,5,B00435KP44,One of the greatest love stories - now a case before the Supreme Court. Everyone needs to watch this movie!,1357776000,2,107,4.4
4253643,5,B00435KP44,"If this story doesn't make you think twice about what marriage is all about, nothing will.  What is marriage, if not a commitment of love and devotion to the other person.  The DOMA is defenseless.  These two women are educated, successful, and courageous enough to live the life of their choosing.  Yes, it made me cry, but more importantly, it made me feel so happy for a couple who found their true soul mates.  A must see!",1323129600,13,426,4.48051948051948
4253644,5,B00435KP44,"After seeing this film one cannot help but experience frustration with the stupid ""Defense of Marriage"" act. Until we recognize that we are all human beings with the same hopes, dreams and expectations for life and love this country will suffer shame. The fact that a significant portion of the population lives without right basic right or in fear is not acceptable. Without preaching and with love and hope this film gets that message across.",1303862400,14,444,4.933333333333334
4253645,4,B00435KP44,"This is a great film. It's an entertaining and endearing documentary that sheds light on today's civil rights issues. By sharing the story of their romance, Edie and Thea have put a face on the gay rights campaign and have, hopefully, helped further the cause.",1303689600,7,260,4.8
4253646,5,B00435KP44,"This inspirational documentary from 2009 transcends cynical observations of what love, marriage and commitment is. Here are two adorable and loving people who shared their lives together joyfully and passionately, but their partnership was not considered legal according to the U.S. Government. Ironically, the Canadian government provides the high note to this story. Edie and Thea were married in Toronto legally.
From another perspective, for those who believe marriage is solely for heterosexuals watch out! After viewing this story, you WILL believe marriage should be for EVERYONE who wants to be married.
EQUALITY under the law is everyone's right according to the Constitution of the United States and not just in Canada.",1297209600,34,729,5.517857142857143
4253647,5,B00435KP44,Excellent sentimental journey,1425945600,,29,9.0
4253648,5,B00435KP44,"I bought this after attending an event that was honoring Ms. Windsor because I wanted to support the woman who took on Goliath. Meeting her left a sour taste in my mouth due to her blatant issues with men, but I looked at the big picture. The film was well-made.",1424822400,,262,4.26
4253649,2,B00435KP44,"Frankly I wasn't sure what this was all about, but it turned out to be a story about the lives of two lesbians as they began their lives up through their Golden years with a lot of flash-backs. If I had know what this was like before I bought it I wouldn't have wasted my money.",1423785600,2,278,3.982142857142857

4253651,4,B00435KP44,A little dry and slow even for documentaries.  But the story is important.,1414108800,,74,4.6923076923076925
4253652,5,B00435KP44,Great movie - too bad they don't show the rest of the story where Edie helps to end DOMA b/c she refused to have the feds treat her and Thea as never married. A landmark achievement.,1414022400,,182,4.083333333333333
4253653,5,B00435KP44,Beautiful Story. Inspiring. Love these two. Thank You Edie and Thea for all you have done!,1413504000,,90,4.6875
4253654,5,B00435KP44,"Love this documentary about Edie Windsor and her life partner and wife, Thea.",1411344000,,77,5.0
4253655,5,B00435KP44,"I have been a movie fan for my entire life and seen many films, but Edie and Thea is the most beautiful and heartfelt love story I have EVER seen!  I forgot if these two people were male or female....all I could see was love, love and more love.  I wish as many people as possible could see this film....perhaps it would help teach the world how to care for one another.  Thank you to all involved in making this story available for viewing.  You will love it!",1405900800,,460,4.193181818181818
4253656,5,B00435KP44,I loved it.  I would highly recommend this beautiful testament of love and commitment for over 40 years between two people.,1402185600,,123,4.857142857142857
4253657,5,B00435KP44,"A very good story of two women together that have lived and gone the distance through the years together.  Tells the tale of illness and struggle but is always blessed with the magic of love that comes from two souls being together that are devoted to each other.
A great tale for young souls to watch and see love does win the day and can be forever even if its a struggle.  Just makes things sweater!  Maybe today its so much easier for people that are different to be together but this is a beautiful tale that's timeless.",1398729600,,525,4.336734693877551

4253659,5,B00435KP44,"This hetro grandmother, cried her eyes out while watching this movie. This movie is about true love--something that evades many for a lifetime.  Edie and Thea had it. How very precious and lucky they were to know such love.  This movie touched my soul.",1395964800,,252,4.704545454545454
4253660,5,B00435KP44,"This was a very well done documentary of two women whose love remained for  many years.
I recommend this documentary to anyone who would like to understand the struggle for gays and lesbians to
work long years to receive equal quality.  It was a very touching love story.  I would suggest this documentary for
religious leaders.  Edie and Thea's relationship is a testimony to what love is all about.
Thank you,
Diane",1392940800,,417,4.75
4253661,5,B00435KP44,"This was a truly heartwarming and at the same time heart wrenching story about two women very much in love for over a period of 43 years.  They were the true definition of soul mates.  Being a sort of docu bio, you saw and felt how they dealt with life in general and also life in a crisis.  This is worthy of way more awards then it received and I would recommend it to anyone, be they gay or straight.  It is a story of true love at its finest!",1389398400,,446,3.922222222222222
4253662,5,B00435KP44,"This is a really good movie about care giving which is going to be a national event in most people's lives.  As more and more boomers are getting older, there will be more and more care giving needed.  In this movie, the couple are very loving and caring in their relationship.  They also have a way of making love look so easy and tender.",1384473600,,339,4.265625

4253664,5,B00435KP44,"Please buy this DVD and show it to your friends and family (specially to those homophobic ones that think that LOVE is only between a man and a woman); they stood against the rejection of their families and society.  Whatever you are, if you can LOVE like this, you are a beautiful human being!",1378512000,,294,4.444444444444445
4253665,5,B00435KP44,"This is quite simply the most glorious love story which became the plaintiff case before SCOTUS over DOMA. Get it, watch it, love it and then get active and work for equality for all.",1377907200,,183,4.411764705882353
4253666,5,B00435KP44,"This well edited fim documents not only a magnificent true love shared for a lifetime, in spite of the harships created by ill health in one of the partners.  Moreover, this film also documents the shame and fear of life as it was years ago when homosexuality was viewed and attacked as an aberration .... and kept hidden for fear of being ostracized, ridiculed or deemed unprofessional.  It presents a triumphant aftermath that warms the heart and fuels our pride for being lesbians.  The fact that Edie stood up and strongly defended her long term relationship with Thea was the backbone of the Supreme Court's ruling against  the DOMA (Defense Of Marriage Act) law.  My hat is off to her and Thea.",1375747200,,700,4.704918032786885
4253667,5,B00435KP44,"These women adore each other and you can tell all the way through this wonderful documentary. Being a photographer I really appreciated the fantastic photos the couple has of their lives together (just look at the amazing photo on the cover of this DVD).  Clearly one of them was a photographer and it is so great to see such fantastic photos of real life lesbians! This is also the Edie who took DOMA to the Supreme court and won!  She is the most down to earth, real person and a great representative for the LGBT community!",1375056000,3,526,4.46875
4253668,5,B00435KP44,"I was so glad I finally found this movie on dvd. It was out of stock for awhile, but I ordered it as soon as it was back. I bought it for a friend's birthday & it got here with plenty of time to spare!",1374019200,,201,3.488888888888889
4253669,5,B00435KP44,"These two lovebirds just made history (or shall I say, herstory?) with the recent Supreme Court decision to grant gay and lesbian couples the same legal rights as heterosexual couples. Thanks to Edie and Thea we have finally joined most of the civilized world and and made same-sex marriage legal in the United States. I hope there will be a new edition of this movie including the Supreme Court victory and President Obama calling Edie Windsor to congratulate her.",1373932800,4,465,4.89873417721519
4253670,5,B00435KP44,Beautiful doc about two amazing women. Love all the photos. Their commitment and achievements are really inspiring as is the work Edie is engaged in now for equal rights.,1371513600,2,170,4.896551724137931
4253671,5,B00435KP44,"I saw this documentary film advertised on the Sundance Channel a couple of months after the surviving spouse, Edie Windsor, heard her appeal against DOMA argued at the U S Supreme Court.  At that time all I knew was that she had to pay over $300,000 in estate taxes after Thea died even tho the two were legally married in Canada -- a marriage not recognized by the IRS of the USA.  It was inspiring & wonderful to see this film & watch a love affair of 40+ years play out from their meeting in the '50s until Thea's death in 2009.  I recommend this film to anyone -- straight or gay -- who is moved by a beautiful, enduring love story.",1370131200,2,636,4.19672131147541
4253672,5,B00435KP44,Great story and timely to watch with the Supreme Court review currently going on. Makes one step back and re-evaluate their own lives,1366934400,,133,4.826086956521739
4253673,5,B00435KP44,"This is the greatest love story, and it involves all the elements of life.  I first saw this documentary on tv a couple years ago, and now I've seen it a dozen times.  The film is only an hour long but it contains great substance.  Edie and Thea's photos are treasurable and their stories engaging.  The subtle touches of music brought sensitivity and color.  A beautiful story.  Good luck Edie!",1366502400,4,395,4.571428571428571
4253674,2,B00435KP44,"Note followup below.
I waited to received this since it was on back order.  After seeing Edie on TV after the Supreme Court presentation and liking her personality, I was looking forward to seeing both of them and learning how much they cared about one another and survived aging and M.S.  I too have been with my partner for 40 years and who also has M.S. though without the financial resources they seem to have had.  I liked the documentary, however, I have a major complaint that really ruined my appreciation of the DVD.  The sound quality is really terrible.  It is as if they had no sound engineer monitoring and improving the quality of the dialog, fuzzy, muted, too soft, not crisply articulated to be heard.  I was left with appreciating the visuals and only understanding some of the words.  I belong to a lesbian group and had hoped to share this with the group at a social meeting.  However, with the poor sound quality there is no point so I am very disappointed in the product and feel cheated having spent the money and don't feel I can share it.

Followup.  I contacted Amazon and the film directors (on facebook) and was told by the directors that the sound shouldn't be bad and suggested I return it to Amazon.  I did contact Amazon for an exchange.  If the next one comes from the same batch and is bad they will contact the manufacturer for redress.  I really want a better copy of their story so I am hoping this works out.",1366070400,5,1445,4.448669201520913
4253675,5,B00435KP44,"I saw a clip and decided to get the video. I must say BRAVO! What courageous women. People forget that it's about HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS  P E R I O D ! ! ! !  And, civil unions don't count, because civil unions create a 2nd class of citizens.  There are over 1,000+ benefits of being married, as we learned in this video e.g., inheritance laws. Same sex couples are not recognized; hence, under the eyes of the law, they are basically strangers that you have e.g., ""willed"" xyz to after your death.  Truly unjust.  Despite it all, this documentary was extremely uplifting. A MUST SEE !!!!!",1365206400,2,596,4.431192660550459
4253676,5,B00435KP44,"A very wonderful story of two amazing ladies. What a wonderful and loving life they shared and endured.

We cried and laughed, and can only hope that we remain as devoted and loving with one another as Edie and Thea did over the course of their 40+ years together.
