8464869,3,B005C6FP0M,Guys Gone Wild Cream of the Crop is a complilation of other ggw dvd's. Do not get me wrong. Most of these guys are hot and show off most of their yummy bodies. My issue is there was no new futage. At the price it is at new men would have been more enjoyable. Other issue is the lack of booty shots. If you do own alot of ggw dvd's this will be a must own. If you already own alot you can skip this one.,1451692800,,402,3.686046511627907
8464870,2,B005C6FP0M,"too much camera movement,bad focus and too much time spent on the lead in on the main part of the guy.",1290211200,,102,3.9047619047619047
8464871,2,B005C6FP0M,"I purchased three ""Guys Gone Wild"" DVDs, and this is the only one I'd watch more than once... and even that is pushing it. If watching a straight guy have some fun with himself is your thing, then a couple of the guys on this DVD might be worth it, but you're probably better off spending your money elsewhere. Most of the DVD is just a bunch of building up to the guys' solos, with very little actual performing.

Had I known all of this beforehand, I might still have purchased this particular DVD in the series just for the sake of seeing what all the hype was about, but at the end of the day, you'd probably get a lot more ""bang for your buck"" elsewhere...

And yes, the pun was intended :-p",1268265600,3,696,4.186567164179104
8464872,1,B005C6FP0M,"This film is poorly shot, poorly edited and not what it is described to be. There is NO WILD in ""Guys gone Wild"".",1265414400,,113,3.9565217391304346
8464873,3,B005C6FP0M,This is like all the rest with one exception: There is one amazing guy who has obviously missed his calling in porn. If you like sexy guys without many brains and great bodies this is a hit. Goes to show what alcohol really does for the spring breakers and jocks alike.,1233878400,7,269,4.294117647058823
