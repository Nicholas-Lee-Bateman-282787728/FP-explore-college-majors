4856309,5,B005P1XSSK,"Amazon has finally put up all seasons of Rugrats after the request of many customers.  I jumped for joy when I saw this.  My only problems are with the fact that Amazon has skipped over the second half of season 2 without a second thought.  There are many good episodes that I would love to have so in the future my collection will be complete.  Also, the best of season 9 set.  I saw that some of my ALL TIME favorite episodes are missing from the set which is disappointing.  Back to season 4 of Rugrats....the season has so many of my favorite episodes that bring back my childhood memories.  I suggest that any Rugrats fan buy this because you will not regret it.  If you want a trip back in time, get this. GET THIS. GET THIS.",1320969600,7,731,4.246376811594203

4856311,5,B005P1XSSK,"OR Good, Tommy. Real good. Depending on your level of fandom that is. Amazon is bringing us season 4 of the classic Nickelodeon series Rugrats. These DVD-R sets are of decent quality, nothing spectacular but they are a few steps up from bootlegs if nothing else, proper artwork and menus all packaged nicely in standard DVD cases. The video isn't cleaned up any, that said the picture quality on these sets is what you remember from original airing so you shouldn't notice any differences. The series is classic, the first five seasons are some of the best children's television ever produced. After completing 65 episodes, enough for syndication, the series took a break in 1995 before returning due to popularity with new episodes. Here are the classic episodes from 1996/97 that SHOULD be included in this collection:

66 Chanukah
67 Mother's Day
68 Vacation
69 Spike's Babies / Chicken Pops
70 Radio Daze / Psycho Angelica
71 America's Wackiest Home Movies / The 'Lympics
72 The Carwash / Heatwave
73 Faire Play / The Smell Of Sucess
74 Dust Bunnies / Educating Angelica
75 Angelica's Last Stand / Clan Of The Duck
76 Potty Training Spike / The Art Fair
77 Send In The Clouds / In The Naval
78 The Turkey Who Came To Dinner
79 The Matress / Looking For Jack
80 Ransom Of Cynthia / Turtle Recall
81 Angelica Orders Out / Let It Snow
82 Angelica Nose Best / Pirate Light

That's 17 twenty two minute episodes or 30 individual stories, 26 at ten minutes and 4 twenty two minute specials (based on the success of the previous season's Passover episode).

So just for those wondering, I say these are the episodes that should appear as Season 2, as released by Amazon, only contains the first thirteen episodes of that 26 episode season. I have included all 17 here as the running time seems to account for all of them minus opening and closing credits. That said, my one complaint other than no extras is that these sets, in an attempt to counter compression issues, remove the opening theme from the episodes and put it only before the first episode on each disc. The same goes for the ending credits. As a purist I like to have the option of watching the theme before each episode, but this won't bother most.

5 stars for the show, 3 stars for these releases. I'll likely buy season 3 and 4 as I did the first two seasons but only because in this case I don't mind being one of those who sacrifices my money in hopes of getting an eventual proper series release with features. At this point though I'm doubting if the series will ever get proper releases, but perhaps someday I'll be pleasantly surprised. Here's hoping season 5 and 6 don't take as long to be released as these seasons did. *Update: I guess it didn't take long, Season 5 is already available!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rugrats-Season-5/dp/B005SI0TYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rugrats: Season 5</a>

*I'm also waiting on the first five seasons of the classic PBS series Arthur, they were right up there with Rugrats in rewatch value and writing.",1317168000,5,3064,4.795454545454546

4856319,5,B005P1XSSK,"I received this particular season as a Christmas gift, and I have to say, excellent! Excellent! It is the first season to cause the series to make a comeback in 1996, 1997, when it returned, after taking a production hiatus for a couple of years, due to popularity it gained during syndication, and this was the season, that made its premier in Snick at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 23, 1997, and remained in that time slot up until the release of Rugrats in Paris in the year 2000.

On this particular season of Rugrats, are several personal favorite episodes of mine, such as the full length 22 minute originally direct to video release, A Rugrats Vacation episode where they go to Los Vegas, the Rugrats Chanukah and Mother's Day specials, and the originally direct to video release, Rugrats Thanksgiving episode, actually called The Turkey Who Came to Dinner.

It also includes several good episodes, such as Spike's Babies, Heat Wave, Faire Play, Dust Bunnies, Send in the Clouds, Looking for Jack, and it even includes the episodes, Hiccups and Autumn Leaves, which were originally released as direct to video episodes on the Dr. Tommy Pickles video cassette back in late 1997, early 1998.

I will note that while this season contains all episodes on the DVD's, the Prime Instant Video release of this particular season, is missing the Rugrats Vacation episode, so, if you want the vacation special, then I strongly recommend you purchase the DVD for your collection.

I will make a note in terms of the episode order, as I was one of the few who recorded this particular season when it premiered on Snick way back when, and when they aired on TV, Dust Bunnies and Educating Angelica aired before Faire Play and The Smell of Success, yet though, on this DVD release, we see Hiccups and Autumn Leaves before we ever reach Dust Bunnies and Educating Angelica, if you're watching in order of the 4 disc set. I personally feel the episodes should be presented in the order in which they premiered on television, which means had this been the case, Hiccups and Autumn Leaves, The Turkey who Came to Dinner, and A Rugrats Vacation would have not premiered until season 5, since during season 4, they were direct to video releases, but no matter, excellent season as always, and it's one I recommend to any Rugrat fan, both the newbies who are just getting into it now, and the older fans like myself, who's been watching the series for practically forever.",1419724800,,2457,4.747072599531616

4856326,5,B005P1XSSK,"The 4th season of Rugrats is famous for having several 22-minute specials, in fact it kicked off with the very popular Chanukah special during the holiday season of 1996 (even non-Jewish people like me and my family, and others worldwide, enjoy it), plus one for Mother's Day (where we finally learn what became of Chuckie's birthmother, in a subtle-but-still-sad way), and the fan-fave Vacation special (comparing it to Decade in Diapers, the original Vacation song is left intact at the beginning of the episode, on both sets), there's even one for Thanksgiving; which proves in extreme ways that Turkey Day isn't about football or parades, but for coming together to give thanks for what we have. The 4th season came in full swing by fall 1997, and this set also contains a pair of episodes from the 5th season; Hiccups and Autumn Leaves. Allow me to explain; Since season 6 had 36 whole shows in production order, and dual-layer DVD-R discs weren't used much by MOD-DVD companies in 2011, the remaining 8 shows got spread out to seasons 5 and 7's sets, causing the aforementioned season 5 episodes to end up here, All Growed Up in season 7 (despite being from season 8) and Preschool Daze in season 8 (despite being from season 7). There's a total of 18 whole shows in this 4-disc set, thus giving us more bang for our bucks by being the same price as seasons 1 and 8, being only 3-disc sets with 13 shows each. Also in this set are Chuckie having the chicken pox (and giving them to the other Rugrats!), Chuckie being temporarily cured of his nasal congestion, Angelica using a voice modulator and the phone to get anything she wanted, the babies bringing a turtle to its ""daddy"", Spike having ""babies"" or kittens (and that's no joke), Tommy and Angelica being filmed for an AFV spoof without success on their daddies' part, a case of mistaken identity while having a flat tire on the way to a Dummi Bears concert, Chuckie's ordeal with ""dust bunnies"", the babies in a film noir (""no-are"") spoof, and their search for treasure while avoiding a ""pirate"" or pilot-light-repairman, Angelica having a Pinocchio-type fiasco from fibbing (and a mosquito bite), the babies trying to get water during a heat wave in the park, and many more escapades! SpongeBob was revived for a 4th season in 2005 (and at least a decade later for a 10th season) in a similar way Rugrats did by the end of 1997; having tons of fans worldwide supporting it & not wanting either show to end so suddenly, on top of Nick seeing big potential for both shows! If you're a longtime fan of Rugrats, and don't care about the guff critics say about seasons 4 through 9, add them to your Rugrats season sets collection today; you won't be sorry!
