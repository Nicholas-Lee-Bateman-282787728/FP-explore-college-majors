8493119,4,B00652U6SS,"David Coleman Headley was one of the people who plotted the Mumbai massacre that took place on November 26, 2008 leaving 166 dead. He lived in the city for 2 years before this event to gather all the necessary information. The FBI did try to interview him but they dropped the case because he was protected by another US agency. He's an informant of DEA office. Some people, including his ex-wife reported his boasts and suspicious behavior to US authority. Again, nothing was done because he was protected by the DEA.
