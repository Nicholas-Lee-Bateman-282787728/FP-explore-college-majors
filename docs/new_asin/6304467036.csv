7872719,4,6304467036,"I was really excited to learn the funky dances of the 1980s so I searched and searched the internet and Christy Lanes Learn the Dances of the 80's was about all I could find. I was a bit disappointed. She does show you a lot of different dances, but she only spends a few minutes on each, which can make you extremely frustrated, especially if you are a beginner. If you don't mind rewinding, rewinding, rewinding to try and catch what she is doing, then you will probably like this video, but of course it is a VHS so all that rewinding wears it out.

  Oh, and if you are looking to learn the Moonwalk.... hah! She literally spends about 15sec on it, and basically all you learn is that moonwalking is sliding your feet as if you are trying to scrape gum off your shoe.

  If you don't mind spending a few bucks, hey go for it, its fun(man I wish I could do some of the moves she does). Be forewarned though, that its hard to keep up because she goes quickly and does not show you very good angles, but since this is about the only 80's funky dance video out there (that I know of) its worth trying.

 Im giving it 4 stars because it was the only 80s dance video I could find.",1102982400,2,1178,4.135964912280702
