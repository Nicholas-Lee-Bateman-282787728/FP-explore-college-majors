Each season focuses on one huge case for the whole season. You learn a lot about the main characters of the show. There is a lot of drama unfolding with everyone. I was always interested in each episode from start to finish.

There is one negative point I must make. You have to watch every episode of the season to understand the ins and outs of the drama that unfolds each episode. You can watch each season without watching the others. However, there are a few mentions of a prior season's drama in seasons 2 and 3. It is not a mandatory thing of having to watch the seasons in order.

I am addicted to watching this show on DVD. I love watching it from start to finish without commercials or interruptions.",1326931200,,865,4.327160493827161
