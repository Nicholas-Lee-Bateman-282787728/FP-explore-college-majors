The blind man in  the general store keeps breaking the glass in the front door with his  walking stick and knocking over various merchandise; Fields values the rich  man's patronage and even refers to him sweetly as ""honey""!

53955,5,0783228341,"The Funniest Movie Ever Made  ""It's a G ift""  W.C. Fields, et al.

  This is without the slightest doubt the funniest movie ever made.  Every time I've watched it, which is about 8-10 times, I end up on the floor, barely able to breathe, and  I don't drink, nor do I have any pulmonary problems. The scene with the coconut bouncing down the stairs in a perfectly timed rhythm is one of the funniest (I don't know how they did it), and one of my other favorite scenes involves the insurance peddler  looking for Karl Lafong, not to mention the scene in which the man wants to buy cumquats, and Fields asks ""How many quats?""  There are too many funny bits in this film to mention, which means you may very well laugh yourself to death.  There are lesser fates.

  Fields, who wrote the script under the pseudonym of Charles Bogle (he has a genius for comic names almost equaling Dickens), plays greengrocer Harold Bissonette (pronounced Bissonay!), long-suffering henpecked husband and father.  His wife nags him, his daughter treats him like a bathroom fixture to be moved out of the way, and his son, who nearly kills his father by leaving a stray roller skate lying around has the cheek to ask ""What's the matter, Pop? Don't you love me anymore?"" I leave it to you to imagine the reaction of the man who once said that one should never share a stage with children or animals.  In this movie, there are two children, but no animals.  What this poor man heroically deals with is quite enough for anyone's endurance, so when he decides to sell his business and move to a California ""orange ranch"" or grove, we've long since been on his side, cheering him along. Even the cumquat man says ""More power to you"" as the long-suffering Harold tries to crank start his Model A.

  A masterpiece of comic timing, both in script and in acting and directing, ""It's a Gift"" is a gift to us all. Show it to your children, and it'll make better people of them.  Perhaps not, but you can try, and by trying, you'll be enjoying the funniest movie of all time.  In these trying times, the gift of laughter is the best of all, and that's the best reason to get this DVD as soon as possible.  (It's part of a collection of other Fields masterpieces).",1220832000,3,2230,4.467821782178218
53956,5,0783228341,"As one who does love Fields, I think this is one of his best.  Grocery story scene with Mr. Muckle is priceless.  The film has a happy ending.",1189728000,,142,4.035714285714286
53957,5,0783228341,"""Sit down Mr. Muckle, sit down honey.""  ""WHERE ARE MY KUMQUATS???!!!""

This perfect comedy is, for my money, the funniest film W.C. Fields ever made, and that's not faint praise.  Small town grocer Harold Bissonette takes his family to California when his Uncle ""Bean"" dies and he inherits an orange grove. This road trip comes sometime past the halfway point of the picture.  And what has taken up the first half?  Just some of the funniest set pieces Fields ever devised.

First there is his harrassed home life, put-upon by everyone from his shrewish wife to his son Norman's errant and deadly rollerskates.  Then there is his harried working life with the furiously impatient customer yelling for his kumquats while Fields attempts to keep the blind Mr. Muckle from destroying every light bulb in his stock with no help from his numbskull assistant whom he doesn't hesitate to abuse. (I read that Fields put in the Mr. Muckle bit to answer a dare that he couldn't find humor in a disabled character...well he did and it is a classic). Then there is the long piece of Fields trying to sleep on the porch beset by rolling coconuts and wood staircases, loud whiny neighbors, shouting vegetable vendors, and the obnoxious annuity salesman looking for the elusive Mr. Lafong ""the railroad'n man"".  The mounting frustration,including Baby Leroy trying to skewer him with an icepick, is a classic exercise in the slow building of comedic bits, one on another, to capture the perfect portrait of utter irritation. And finally there is the road trip where Fields shows his put-upon everyman to be just as boorish as anyone as he and his family trash an estate and carry on like rubes.

It all ends, as Fields movies often did, with Bissonette triumphant, and finally embraced by his obsteperous family and allowed to indulge his fancy for alcohol and oranges.  A great movie that wastes no time and moves from one classic bit to the other without distraction.  I don't know if modern audiences can appreciate how radical Fields was in his day presenting a central character with few redeeming graces and every vice conceivable and endearing this character to a far different, far less cynical and snarky, America than the one we live in.  He was a genius, and this film captures it. DVD soon please.",1163116800,4,2294,4.823979591836735
53960,5,0783228341,"W.C. Fields was simply the most talented comedian who ever lived, and ""It's a Gift"" (1934) is his most accessible feature. It's a loose remake of the 1926 silent ""It's the Old Army Game"" which stared Fields and Louise Brooks; and which Fields wrote. Like most silent features, the scene transitions are very abrupt, with titles used in place of scripted transitional elements.

For ""It's a Gift"", Director Norman McLeod elected to stay true to the original and keep the flavor of its sudden transitions. Although the technique is jarring to modern viewers it works to the film's comic advantage by speeding up the pace of the film, as it moves from set piece to set piece with virtually no filler. You get everything that would have had any entertainment value in a 90-minute feature compressed into a 73-minute picture. Imagine a four-act play with one-second breaks between each act.

Act I takes place in the in the apartment home of the Bissonette family; consisting of put upon everyman husband/father Harold (Fields), his shrewish wife Amelia (Kathleen Howard), overwrought teenage daughter Jean (Jean Rouverol), and roller skating 9-year old son Norman (Tom Bupp). The most famous bit is Fields trying to finish shaving after his daughter has eased him away from the bathroom mirror.

Harold is the proprietor of a small grocery store and Act II takes place inside the store. The most famous bit concerns blind Mr. Muckle (Charles Sellon) whose flailing cane causes a staggering amount of damage.

Act III finds Harold back home trying to set some sleep. The best bit involves a series of trivial interruptions as everyone from the milk man to an insurance salesman manage to disturb him the moment it appears he is finally going to get some rest.

Act IV is the family's move to California by automobile to start a new life on an orange ranch Harold has purchased with his inheritance.

It's pretty much constant laughs, all the more remarkable because Fields stays in character for the entire duration. Harold Bissonette is his most sympathetic character, just an average guy badgered and hounded to the point of exasperation. Unlike his other features there are no cheap laughs from drinking or from leering at young women. The comedy derives entirely from Fields (and Howard who gets a laugh with every single line), it a nightmare realistic enough to make you squirm.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1162771200,2,2426,4.902439024390244
53961,5,0783228341,"W.C. Fields is without an equal when portraying a henpecked husband.  Playing downtrodden New Jersey grocer Harold Bissonette in this 1934 offering, Fields in at the mercy of his sharp tongued wife played wonderfully by Kathleen Howard.  Fields, a harmless schnook is also being pestered by his young son Norman and older daughter Mildred.  Baby Leroy, also part of the cast, doesn't need to try hard to get under the skin of the slow burning Fields.

The family is taking issue with his decision to buy an orange ranch in California courtesy of an inheritance from his Uncle Bean.  Fields setting himself up as an orange expert has purchased a useless old farm without first having seen the property.  As the family makes their way across country, Fields must endure many hysterical challenges.  Despite all his shortcomings all ends up well for the Bissonettes.

The scene in the grocery store with blind customer Mr. Muckle destroying a lightbulb display and glass doors while another customer is screaming for kumquats is a classic comedy scene.  Fields attempt to get some shut eye outside on his porch swing while being overwhelmed by every noise imaginable is also farcical.",1115078400,5,1181,4.98469387755102

53963,4,0783228341,"I have recently become a big W.C. Fields fan. I enjoy the classic comedies of the 20s - 40s and watching such people as Laurel & Hardy, the Marx Brothers, Bob Hope, & Charlie Chaplin, but Fields was never a favorite. I think the reason for this was because I was too young to truly understand the character. I was only 5 years old or so. But, after receiving a DVD showing 6 short films it restored a new interest in Fields' work. I have seen films such as ""You Can't Cheat An Honest Man"", ""My Little Chickadee"", and ""The Bank Dick"", but I hadn't seen ""It's A Gift"" until recently. I think it is an absolute comedy masterpiece that was a perfect vehicle to showcase the Fields persona.
 Fields plays Harold Bissonette owner of a grocery store and has been married to Amelia, his annoying wife, for twenty years. They have two children, or brats as Fields might call them, who make life difficult for him. Fields has a grand idea, he wants to go into the orange business and buy an orange ranch. He plans on getting enough money to do so after his beloved (?) uncle dies. And that is the set-up. You won't get another bit of information out of me concerning the plot, namely because there's nothing more to tell. The film now consist of gags built in the story. Only I don't recall ever laughing so much.
 The movie is directed by Norman Z. McLeod. Most fans of early comedies may know that name. He directed several Bob Hope films (""My Favorite Spy"", ""Casanova's Big Night"", & ""Paleface"") along with two Marx Brother comedies (""Horse Feathers"" & ""Monkey Business"") so I think some credit should be thrown his way as well. He understood comedy and brought out the best in his actors.
 Fans of ""The Great Man"" are really going to appreciate this film. It reminds me of a Harold Lloyd film ""Hot Water"". But now after seeing this, I must admit, Fields seems to have much more fun with the character. Not to say that Lloyd was trying to play that type of character. This is honestly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Get ready to laugh.
 Bottom-line: One of Fields' best films. A comedy masterpiece showing the Fields persona in great stride. For my money and time one of the funniest films ever!",1074816000,10,2202,4.443069306930693
53964,5,0783228341,"""It's a Gift"" may very well be W.C.Fields' most brilliant film.  Certainly, it is his most consistently hilarious one, but at the same time his darkest. The paradox loving critic who once maintained that comedy was a sadder art than tragedy as it left people unchanged in their follies and vices could well have had a film like this in mind as an illustration of that doctrine. One inch below its hilarious surface, there is pretty consistent domestic misery.  Stuffed full of marvelously funny sequences,""It's a Gift"" details the automobile move from East Coast to West sometime during the 30's by a sorely beset grocery store owner, his nagging wife (""I've never had a servant, probably never shall!""), his selfish affianced daughter, and his pip of a bratty son. Unlike happier Fields comedies in which he has at least one good human relationship, usually that with his daughter, here to the entire family he is merely odd man out. Added to this alienation, there's the fact that the entire human and physical universe is against him, both on his trip across the States as well as before it. Thus he is thwarted in due course by an ill-placed roller skate, a selfish blind man, Baby LeRoy, an enabling mother, a molasses spill, clinking milk bottles, a bouncing coconut, a persistent insurance salesman, a noisy street peddler, grapes dropped into his open mouth during sleep, an unfoldable folding chair, a gated mansion, a statue in its park that ""runs right in front of his car,"" and finally an orange grove that's without oranges, much less a single tree. Though the Fields character pulls off something of an economic triumph in the final sequences, it is the continuing alienation of his character that is reinforced in the final frame. As his ever selfish family sets off to some new snobbish event in fancy clothes and in an even fancier car, Fields by choice remains alone, essentially as he was before the trip to California, though he does have a new companion of sorts now, a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice which he can generously spike with his always present flask of hard liquor.",1033776000,8,2103,4.822714681440443
53965,5,0783228341,"In New Jersey, inept storekeeper Harold Bissonette is constantly nagged and badgered by his domineering wife, Amelia, his obnoxious son Norman and his lovestruck daughter Mildred. When his Uncle Bean dies, Harold uses his $5,OOO inheritance to buy an orange ranch in California through Mildred's boyfriend, John Durston, but does not tell Amelia...The unique enjoyment which is derived by those who cherish this film comes from watching Fields in a variety of classic situations: his reactions and fine timing.  As Amelia, Harold's shrike of a wife, Kathleen Howard is hilariously right on the money.  Trivial footnotes: Charles Bogle, who is credited as story writer, was a pseudonym of W.C. himself.  The famous porch scene was filmed at Jesse Lasky's ranch and the final shot was filmed at Field's home in Encino, California.

53969,5,0783228341,"W. C. Fields is at his ""man against the world"" best in this hilarious comedy.  The plot of grocery store operator Harold Bissonette (pronounced Bisso-NAY, please), who yearns for a California orange ranch, is secondary to the frequent moments of classic comedy.  For sidesplitting laughter, check out Harold's encounter with Mr. Muckle, the blind and deaf hotel detective who wreaks havoc in the grocery store.  In addition, Harold trying to sleep on the porch swing is one of the greatest comedy scenes ever filmed.  Aside from noisy neighbor disruptions, he suffers an assertive insurance salesman looking for Carl LaFong (""Capital 'L,' small 'a,' capital 'F,' small 'o,' small 'n,' small 'g.' LaFong!).  Harold's reaction to these various annoyances keeps the viewer in stitches.  Harold's shrewish wife and her scolding reaction to everything her husband says or does puts the ""fun"" in dysfunctional.  Fields also has a couple of encounters with Baby LeRoy.  Obnoxious children and their overbearing mothers are among Fields' best targets for razor-sharp comedy.  Even Harold and the family dog don't get along.  Harold threatens to replace the dog with an ""iron"" deer lawn ornament.  Fields' comic style stresses physical humor, sight gags, and his trademark asides.  The comic side of drinking is part of his standard routine, good taste notwithstanding.  Fans of W. C. Fields, classic comedy fans, and everyone who enjoys debunking the guises of stuffy respectability needs this movie for their personal movie collection.

53972,5,0783228341,"In a number of films, W. C. Fields played a variation on the theme of the hen-pecked husband, but it all came together to perfection in ""It's A Gift,"" an hilarious comedy directed by Norman Z. McLeod.  Harold Bissonette  (Fields) owns a small grocery store, has an overbearing wife, Amelia  (Kathleen Howard), a daughter, Mildred (Jean Rouverol), who is in love, a  son, Norman (Tommy Bupp), with a penchant for leaving roller skates in the  wrong places, and aspirations to a better life that includes wealth,  leisure, respect and gin (not necessarily in that order).  He has his eye  on an orange grove in sunny, Southern California, complete with a house,  that he's seen a picture of in a magazine.  When ""Uncle Bean"" passes away,  Harold parlays a modest inheritance into the purchase price, and the  pursuit of the dream becomes a reality, much to the chagrin of Amelia, who  thinks he's a fool.  And lets him know about it in no uncertain terms.  A  cross country foray to the promised land with the entire family follows,  and when they finally arrive in California, they find the house in  disrepair and nary an orange to be seen; at least not in their grove.  Harold refuses to give up, of course, and with a little luck, and some  shrewd bargaining with a land developer in need of a parking lot, by the  end he's living his dream.  The humor in this film is vibrant and  punctuated throughout by the inimitable Fields, with his trademark  delivery, body language and, of course, the ""proboscis,"" that have made him  an icon of Americana.  There's one uproarious scene after another,  especially one in which Harold tries to take a nap on the porch while  contending with noisy neighbors upstairs and down, an ice pick wielding  child, and an insurance salesman (T. Roy Barnes) looking for a man named  LaFong:  ""LaFong, Carl LaFong.  Capital `L' small `a,' capital `F' small  `o' small `n' small `g.'  LaFong!""  he says.  ""I don't know LaFong,"" Harold  replies, ""And if I did, I wouldn't tell you!""  Another memorable scene  takes place in the store, and involves the blind Mr. Muckle (Charles  Sellon), who has an encounter with a display of light bulbs, and a young  lad who discovers the tap on a vat of molasses; all of which produces the  anticipated results.  With a supporting cast that includes Julian  Madison (John, Mildred's fiance), Baby LeRoy (Baby Dunk), Tammany Young  (Everett Ricks), Josephine Whittell (Mrs. Dunk) and Diana Lewis (Miss  Dunk), ""It's A Gift"" is a laugh-out-loud movie that can be watched over and  over again; this is Fields at his best, in a timeless classic comedy that  gets funnier every time you see it.

7790302,5,0783228341,This is W. C. Fields at his best . Hysterically funny. In order to really appreciate this film you must pay close attention to how MR. Fields is treated by his family.  Especially at breakfast when everyone takes the sugar. Just watch what he does with his coffee!!,1474675200,,265,4.520833333333333

7790306,5,0783228341,"This is an absolutely wonderful screwball slapstick and one of the best of W.C. Fields. The movie goers loved the magical work of the great genius who could make people laugh despite their troubles at the height of Great Depression. When it was released, the critics were not so enthusiastic about the story. A contemporary review from 'Argus', The Literary Digest of 1935 was critical and said that ""It is clumsy, crude and quite amateurish in its appearance. The film is about the life of a grocery store owner and his daily battles with a shrewd wife, an incompetent assistant, annoying children, customers, and salesmen. W. C. Fields' later work, The Bank Dick, is another example for a mans battle against his domestic entrapment and the abuses he faces!

The story of the film was originally written by J.P. McEvoy and Charles Bogle (pseudonym for W.C. Fields).  Fields had filmed the story as silent film under the name of It is the Army Game in 1926. But it was really a string of gags and situations perfected by Fields in his decades of vaudeville, Ziegfeld Follies, and Movie Shorts, including the classic porch scene in which he sleeps after an argument with his wife. The rosy-nosed comic pulled off rare feats in the film as a laugh-rising character. In the supporting role, Kathleen Howard as a demanding wife offers an excellent performance, and so is Jean Rouverol as Fields daughter who drives him crazy. This was a William Le Barons low-budget film but ended up earning sizeable revenue: Highly recommended!",1442448000,,1526,4.865384615384615
7790307,5,0783228341,One of the funniest movies ever. I laughed until I cried the first time I saw it and every time after. Priceless comedy not to be missed.,1441324800,,137,4.111111111111111
