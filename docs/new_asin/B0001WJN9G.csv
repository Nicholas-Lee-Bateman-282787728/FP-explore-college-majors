8016925,2,B0001WJN9G,"I realize that it's currently chic to trash anything positive, and SUPERGUY definitely oozes into that category. I punched ""eject"" about twenty minutes into this extended example of adolescent flatuence humor, and I don't even plan to dignify this soiled gymsock by dropping it into the ""free"" bin at the local Library; for that matter, I wouldn't dignify it by taking it skeet shooting.",1491091200,,387,5.0625
8016926,1,B0001WJN9G,"There is a reason why this flick is on sale for $1.99. LONG, drawn out film about a regular guy, with regular problems that fights crime and saves the day. Can we get some new material here?! I give the special effects an above average rating, but the entire story lacked substance.  I was waiting for the film to take the viewer somewhere, but instead, it took me to a path of ""Super Nothing..."" Truly disappointing from beginning to end. SuperGuy:  I want my money back!",1332288000,,472,4.476744186046512
8016927,1,B0001WJN9G,"Superguy is a mock-documentary about the life of a superhero.  It's supposed to be funny, I think, but it's not- it's just dull.  I found it hard to even finish watching it.",1167868800,,173,4.375
8016928,5,B0001WJN9G,"Watch your backs, Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy... you've got some real competition in Mark Teague's ""Superguy: Behind the Cape.""  Although clearly an independent production made on a shoestring budget, this ""mockumentary"" has a generous amount of laughs, laced with a hint of charm.

Teague's performance as Superguy rates points for versatility.  He could have given us a one-dimensional, single-minded ""hero"" along the lines of a mimic doing a bad Shatner-as-Kirk impression.  Instead, his ""Superguy"" is a complex character who tries to do a job, takes pride in doing it well, and vacillates from puzzlement to sadness to anger when things are going against him.

The peripheral characters are also showcased well, particularly Superguy's drunken redneck father and his ultimate fan, a postal worker living in his mother's basement.  The latter particularly resonates: between the sheer ridiculousness of his devotion and the pathos of his personal life, it's almost a Chaplinesque performance.  (I supsect too that anyone who knows comic book or ""Star Trek"" devotees will find this guy VERY recognizable!)

Given the extreme low budget, the special effects are marvelous.  You're not going to awestruck, but you will likely be impressed... and perhaps tempted to ""try it yourself,"" if your PCs or Macs are up to it.

All-in-all, this is a funny, well-written look at all sides of the super hero phenomenon.  I laughed about as much as I did when watching ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind.""  You will too.",1138579200,,1513,5.181069958847736
8016929,4,B0001WJN9G,"I have heard people call this a mockumentary similar to the classic Spinal Tap. If you ask me it's more like a mock-biography. It has the feel of a VH-1 Behind the Music sort of thing or a 20/20 expose. Anyway this movie is a great little production in the life and times of a super hero. It's obviously a low budget independent film. However what they do with the resources they have are very impressive.

The special effects are all essentially bluescreen digital effects, but it looks good. It's the sort of production quality I would expect from television shows like The Tick or Charmed. The cameras used aren't as good, but since it's filmed like a documentary/expose the camera work actually lends itself to a more authentic feel. The acting is actually pretty good if a bit understated. I think Mark Teague made a perfect SuperGuy.

The film itself is very funny at the get go if you're into the mockumentary sort of thing. However in the middle things start getting a bit on the disturbing side. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a dark comedy at that point or something else. In that middle section the movie's pace suffers. It feels like the interviews and footage drag on and on a bit too much. However by the end the momentum picks back up again.

My take on the more serious side of this production is the fact that this movie puts out an interesting social commentary on how society would react to having a real live superhero in their midst. You will find bits of things happening that are found in other superhero parodies like The Incredibles (but I can't say the Brad Bird took the ideas from Superguy), which I think further validates the idea here.

This DVD actually has a host of interesting extras and I'm surprised they aren't listed here. You get a blooper reel with various outtakes, several deleted scenes, a fascinating image gallery, two movie trailers, and of course previews from the DVD maker. All in all this collection of extra features are really quite good. The only thing that would have made it even better would have been a commentary track by cast and crew.

I notice there is no plot synopsis listed either so here is my take on that. What you have is an expose in the life of Superguy. From his humble beginnings to his rise to capitalist fame to the trials and tribulations of being a superhero. You get to hear interviews from family, co-workers, fans, critics and others along with seeing news footage of his exploits as well as the hero behind the cape in his home.

If you catch this DVD anywhere and like what you hear so far go ahead and pick up a copy. It's worth a bargain price if you are  casual fan. I would only pay more if you are really into independent films and/or comic book/superhero jargon.",1118361600,,2757,4.502
8016930,5,B0001WJN9G,"Imagine a super hero who is built up as an idol by the adoring American public only to be torn down and vilified once they realize that he has imperfections and can't be in more than one place at a time.

This is brilliant cinema and funny as all get-out.",1104883200,,255,4.1
