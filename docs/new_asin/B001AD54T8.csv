8277032,4,B001AD54T8,"I'll be quite honest here, I have never seen the full length version of this film - however, I have, seen a rather comical over-dub of this movie in an Australian-made & produced film by the name of 'Hercules returns' (1992), which was the brainchild of two genius writer/performers by the names of Des Mangan and Sally Patience, who had a prlonged success with a theatre show by the name of 'Double-take does ....'.  The concept of the show was to play an (old) film such as this classique 'sandal & sword' extravaganza, and over-dub the original dialogue, using silly voices for all the characters ie; slurping sounds for the kissing scenes, using Australian slang where it would have been serious scenes such as 'geez you're a top kisser!!!', referring to bad jokes, the whole musclemen/latent inferred homosexuality, etc.(no offence to anyone intended), quite a snigger-fest.  The film has achieved cult-status in the land down-under, muchly due to the success of the theatre show, it was said that the Australian movie had used another sandal & sword epic, 'Hercules, Samson & Ulysses', starring Steve Reeves, however, this is incorrect, after much research, I discovered that this gem was the basis for the film.  This movie features Alan Steel as the mighty Hercules, Nadir Baltimore as Samson, Yann L'Arvor as Ursus and Howard Ross as Maciste.  All in all I look forward to seeing this particular epic in its entirety, without the silly voices, the overt profanity ....or the base humour ...... but then again, maybe I'll just run them thru in my head while I watch the real thing!! The movie is an Italo-Spanish production made in 1962 and its original title was;  'Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus gli invincibili' (Hercules, Samson, Maciste, and Ursus: the Invincibles).
Post-Script... I've seen the movie, as interesting as it was to see it in its true original presentation, I think I preferred the Australian Comedic version tbph  :)",1266969600,2,1947,4.975384615384615
8277033,1,B001AD54T8,Terrible. A waste of film and time.  Miserable washed out print.  No redeeming values.  Skip it.,1250553600,2,96,4.875
8277034,4,B001AD54T8,"This has been one of my favorite films from the golden age of gladiator movies(1957-1967)since the first time I saw it at age 10. It's a comedy that features not only Samson,but Hercules,Maciste and Ursus as well. It's a lot more fun than The Three Stooges Meet Hercules and each ""actor"" playing one of the legendary heroes has an outstanding physique. Anyone of them could star in their own gladiator-type movie. When Hercules defies the wishes of his father,Zeus,to go off in search of wine,women and song he engages in a series of misadventures in the land of Lydia. Eventually he and Samson are tricked into fighting each other. The first time they lock horns is after Delilah gives Samson a haircut, which of course takes away his great strength. After his hair grows back he and Hercules engage in a free for all with the other two musclemen before the quartet form an alliance at the film's climax. The quality of this copy is slightly washed out. But at this price no fan of this particular film genre should be without a copy of this clever parody. There should have been a sequel of some sort.",1245715200,7,1103,4.604060913705584
