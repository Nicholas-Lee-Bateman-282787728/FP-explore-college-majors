1829922,5,B00008972E,A good buy for an old classic! This is a fun one to watch and it got here really fast!,1278720000,,86,3.35
1829923,5,B00008972E,"I've loved this special since I first saw it on MTV 8 years ago.  You really have to have the exact right kind of sense of humor in order to appreciate this, otherwise you will most likely hate it.  There really is no one else like Tom Green; he pulls off such childish, ridiculous, immature and often disgusting comedy in a way that I have never seen equaled or matched by any other comedian or actor.  This hour-long TV special, as well as the movie Freddy Got Fingered, are really on their own platform that no one else has been able to touch upon and are great examples of Tom Green in his prime.  Sure, there are other childish comedians and there are other horribly disgusting/offensive comedy movies, but they're always too obvious or only occasionally funny; with Tom's stuff, the laughs are constant.

I think Subway Monkey Hour may have been Tom's swansong; after around this time (2002) he sort of faded into obscurity and his few attempts at returning to comedy since then have just not worked, not on the level that the 90's - '02 material did.  This is a great DVD to watch for nostalgia and/or if you have a very specific sense of lowbrow humor.",1273622400,,1160,4.5
1829924,5,B00008972E,"The title is not as catchy as ""Subway Monkey Hour"" but one thing is true -- Tom Green's clash between humor and performance art makes for a disturbing and embarrassing scene for anyone who watches it.  I have shown this to many Japanese people and they simply cannot watch the whole thing.  If you thought the ""Jackass"" movies in Japan were funny at all, this will show you what ""he goes too far"" means to the orderly and peaceful people of Japan.",1272240000,,447,4.439024390243903
1829925,5,B00008972E,If you can appreciate Tom's off-the-wall unconventional humor then you'll love this.  I laugh so hard it hurts.  He annoys the Japanese relentlessly on this trip and it's hysterical.  No one can do this like Tom.  I highly recommend.,1252627200,,233,4.897435897435898
1829926,1,B00008972E,"Tom, if you can go south states , make fun of African American people like you did to innocent Japanese people and
get out of alive, I'll buy a copy.",1182470400,,149,4.0
1829927,5,B00008972E,"""What kind of monkeys are those? B'boons?"" ""AHAHAHAHA! YOU FELL ON YOUR BUM BUM! YOU FELL ON YOUR BUM BUM! - did you see it?"" ""WHO WANTS BANANAS!!"" ""Randy Rokakanoknoknok"" As you can tell I've watched this thing more than several times and it still is just as funny every time! A few of the segments are not really that funny to me though, like the ""wanna see how loud i can whistle"" one and a couple others. But on the whole it is classic Tom Green, also interesting to see the various ways in which the japanese react to him!",1168387200,,527,4.227722772277228
1829928,3,B00008972E,"Here Tom Green victimizes the poor polite, respectful people of Japan, w/his impolite humor.  Some funny stuff, a few really funny scenes, and some slightly funny scenes.  Good only really for fans of the Tom Green Show or Freddy Got Fingered.  Tom Green does sight gags, if you don't know him.  He doesn't tell jokes; he just does outrageous and inappropriate and weird things, which I normally find hilarious.  While I prefer Freddy Got Fingered (grade A+) or the regular Tom Green Show, this one has it's moments.  The Bonus Features have some worthwhile scenes from the Tom Green Show, in North America.  There's also a written bio of Tom Green in the bonus features.  Here's some examples of Tom's Japan stunts in the main feature (which are all in public): Dressed like Elvis and sung through loudspeaker on sacred temple grounds.  Tries to take a zoo tour in a full body costume.  Wakes up people sleeping in a hotel, while wearing a fork costume. Lies down on the ground at the top of the stairs in the middle of rush hour crowd from the subway.  Simulates sex w/ dancing mechanical Santa Claus in the subway.  Continues to talk aloud in a packed, quiet subway train.  Puts a vibrating dildo on a sushi bar's self serve conveyor belt.  Feeds wild monkeys, and invites them into his van.  etc...",1164412800,,1302,4.649122807017544
1829929,5,B00008972E,This little movie is great........I love that Pizza pie song and his jam with Aqua Juice....very funy...but not as funny as the way i spelled funny...,1133222400,,150,4.8076923076923075
1829930,5,B00008972E,"hey people out there, i guess theres not as many british fans out there of the tom green show as there is in america. but the tom green monkey thingy was great, its so funny he loves it. and if you don't understand wot tht meens you can poo yourself. he runs up to this woman in the zoo in a monkey costume and makes stupid nioses, its great just my sort of thing. if you have got a stupid sense of humour and you love being outragous you will love it i certanly did. yay toms dw best becky x",1118102400,,492,3.881188118811881
1829931,3,B00008972E,"I've always been a big fan of Tom Green. I watched his show all the time, and I've seen all his movies. The Subway Monkey
Hour follows Tom all around Japan, as he makes an ass out of himself and scares the Japanese. Many of the things he does here are hilarious. Like, for example, the molestation of a mechanical Santa, or laughing at a man when he trips on a set of stairs. There are other moments, however, that are pretty uneventful and won't hold your intention. The thing is, Tom usually doesn't get much of a reaction out of the people in Japan, and seeing the reaction is sometimes the funniest part. Overall, the Subway Monkey Hour is very funny and entertaining, but is not as good a special as you would expect from Tom Green.",1086480000,,737,4.3478260869565215
1829932,4,B00008972E,"When I first watched this special I thought it was the most brilliant thing ever! Now after a while, when I watch it on DVD, I realize that although it may not have been as funny as I thought, is pretty funny! Only a person like Tom Green could so effortlessly pull off a special like this. It never seems like the comedy is forced, but is instead, just who Tom is. My particular favorite bits include Tom stripping out of a Godzilla costume AND his normal clothes in the middle of a Japanese monkey zoo, him spending some time at Japanese temples, his time spent played with the Japanese band Aqua Juice, and the time he spent on a Japanese subway car! ....",1052352000,,658,4.314516129032258
1829933,3,B00008972E,"although this dvd has some funny bits (such as mr. green playing piano and drums to befuddled japanese audiences!), it's not as good as the dvd collections of his canadian tv show from the '90s - 'early exposure' and 'endangered feces' (hopefully more similar compilations will come out). check out those 2 dvd's before 'subway monkey.'",1049068800,,336,5.017857142857143
1829934,5,B00008972E,"This is one of the funniest things on tv I have ever seen, and it is so wonderful that is finally out on DVD! It's a cute DVD, very basic: The full special (with some new scenes in it too), scene selection, and Bonus Features. The bonus features had some skits from the show, only some of which were really really funny. I took off a few ""points"" because of that, even though it is THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!! Despite that, I would definitely reccomend this to any fan of The Tom Green Show or anyone who likes that kind of real-life comedy. It is so great. Thank you so so much to Tom Green and MTV for making this!!!
P.S. Yeah! I am the first reviewer of this at this sight!",1048723200,,678,4.143939393939394

7980051,4,B00008972E,"You almost feel sorry for the exceptionally polite and respectful Japanese.  Tom goes everywhere making a loud public spectacle of himself.  He keeps it going so long many of them finally snap and try to push or drag him away.  Some moments don't work, and Tom seems to sense it.  But the ones that do are fascinating.",1345075200,,318,4.526315789473684

I remember watching this on MTV a long time ago, so when I finally got this DVD, I was ecstatic! I have shown it to my friends who have never even heard of Tom Green, & they enjoyed it as well. This segment has truly inspired me to wear a 'Go Fork Yourself' tee to Japan sometime in the future. The Japanese might not get it, but I will!",1343433600,,441,3.966292134831461
