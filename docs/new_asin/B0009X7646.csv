2332483,5,B0009X7646,"To address one of the earlier reviews:  This collection of the mythology episodes is something shorter and more cohesive than sifting through all the many dvd discs of the entire series to keep track of the story. therein lies the benefit of a smaller collection. I for one would never have remained loyal to this series if not for it's thorny conspiracy backbone. Proof of that importance is also why they often saved this category of stories for sweeps weeks (each season -start and finish- was 'capped' off with these episodes... because they knew fans were so eager to see the story develop further (and with true X files fashion - answer questions while posing new ones). So much fun. I for one only ever taped [yes, 'taped'] the mythology episodes...and tried to cut out the commercials for the ease of later viewing.... So this collection being released as it is..... is a treat. What's more..you start to remember where you were and who you were with while initially watching the episodes... and that [to me] screams sentiment!",1309132800,3,1035,4.814606741573034
2332484,5,B0009X7646,"By now we know about Fox Mulder and his crusade to find his sister. We also know about the aliens and that they are taking people, and we know about the Black Oil and how it works - somewhat. The ""alien virus"" notion is out there as well, and Skully has shown us what all it can do on the scientific front. This leaves us open to the fact that there are aliens and that the aliens are quite possibly setting up shop on Earth, something that might be quite bad. Enter the Syndicate, the conspiracy rooted in the lore of yesteryear, and the fact that there are some big egos waiting to unleash something quite bad on the whole of humankind.

Beofre starting, I feel like I need to mention the one inster that proves to be important in all these sets. It is a timeline/ people list AND it is connective when placed with all the other sets. That means you would want to have it and that means you would want to get them all. That also means you have the one feature you might want to get out of all of these sets. The other special feature, basically an interview with Kim Manners or Chris Carter every 3 or 4 episodes, is not that big. You also get some deleted things here and there, but you really do not get that many. The insert, however, is nice and beautiful and is something you might want to check on - missing it is bad considering I want mine to frame because they look so nice.

In this set, you have a few major players coming in. The First Elder, Well-Manicured Man, C.G.B Spender (Smoking Man), Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Gibson Praise, and the Alien Rebels are all listed here. Some are part of the syndicate and you would not know their names if they were not mentioned. Others play odd roles when it comes out, like Praise, and others are names coming out of our character's past (Fowley). The Rebels also play an interesting role and ne I would not have seen coming, and all of them come together to complete a huge arch that was three sets long. Even if you do not like the last set and what it stands for, the three sets that start everything are impoortant when it comes to the X-Files. In fact, the story in the story in connective and essential here.

When it comes to this set, it does have some overlap with Black Oil and Abduction. You see the Black Oil more and have the things starting to play out. This means you have a nice piece of media and it points out something you might want ot look at. I personally enjoy the fact that everything hits here, and that some really odd stuff happens in this. In fact, some of the things change a lot of what happens and show exactly what the aliens and what the clones can do. It is good stuff.

I guess the real question here is whether or not you need this and the answer is - maybe. I cannot envision skipping this myself, but I like having the inner story plucked out and shown to everyone around me. You are talking aobut 3 seasons of inner workings and, immediately, it is hard to pull into the limelight. True, it is something you can get to and the seasons contain it. Still, it is not on the surface and it is not so easy to handle.

I think a person who wants this knows it and, honestly, fans and casual watchers alike may enjoy it. There are some episodes that could be debated on their merit here, but that is one of the many things that could be thrown out and discussed. What cannot be argued is that this is the backbone of the show and it is important in painting an overall picture. Accordingly, I give it a 5/5 and say that like is enough meri to obtain. Just make certain the timeline is there.

Thanks and I hope this helps.",1299283200,2,3614,4.2228654124457305
2332485,4,B0009X7646,"This isn't a bad set of episodes by any means, but I think many fans would agree that at around this point in the series it started to get a little too weird, which does affect the entertainment aspect a bit IMHO. If this is any indication where volume 3 starts off, the Syndicate/Consortium is destroyed on the second of its four discs, effectively wiping out the colonization ""project"" that has been in the show since the beginning for the most part.

I only had two minor criticisms with the product as a whole, and the Mythology Collection in general, and those are the 'theme' or 'title' of each volume doesn't really mean anything and the choice of episodes included are somewhat questionable. The volumes show the mythology episodes in chronological order, so I don't know why they were given titles/themes instead of just cover images and volume numbers. If this were strictly the 'colonization' collection the earlier stuff that sets up this conspiracy would be here rather what we get. Also, the episode selection a little too conservative; there are several eps that should've been included, with a few others that were being left out, but for some reason only the eps that directly involved the mythology/conspiracy were included and not ones that delved further into the plot and characterization. Other than those issues I rather enjoyed the continuation of the mythology plot.",1282608000,2,1391,4.944444444444445
2332486,4,B0009X7646,It's been interesting reading the reviews of the X-Files Mythology series.  The die hard fans love it all.  THe purists find fault in episodes not included.  I was out of the country during the X-years and appreciate this whole set of 4 topic driven collections.  I can watch the sets one at a time and get a good overview of the threads of the series.  I think it's a good idea and will use this same review for each.  bg,1247616000,,422,4.2125
2332487,4,B0009X7646,"This was a very good ""supplement"" to the two (2) ""movies"" that have come out. This is a spin-off for the first movie and was quite good. I really enjoyed watching this.",1239926400,,168,4.28125
2332488,5,B0009X7646,"This review is more or less a reflection on the entirety of the Mythology series which streamlines the Alien conspiracy from begining to end.

If there was any difficulty following the main story - this picks and chooses exactly what you need to know.

In my opinion, this works best as a complete set and watched in chronological order from the pilot (on the Abduction Series) though the final episodes(on the Super Soldier Series.)  In total there are 4 sets to complete the story chronologically.  It's an affordable alternative to purchasing each season right from the get go.

Highly reccomended as a fan of the X-Files.",1141603200,8,625,4.8584905660377355
2332489,4,B0009X7646,"This third volume in the X-Files mythology series contains 16 episodes from seasons five through eight, including Patient X, The Red and the Black, The End, The Beginning, S.R. 819, Two Fathers, One Son, Biogenesis, The Sixth Extinction, The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati, Sein und Zeit, Closure, En Ami, Requiem, Within, and Without; all of which focus on the ""Colonization"" aspect of the show's main story arc.  Many of the episodes featured here (from season's five and six mainly) are classic episodes that revealed much of the show's grand scheme, but the last few featured here weren't up to the same quality that fans of the show expected.  There are some pluses here, including the introduction of Agent John Dogget (Terminator 2's Robert Patrick), but as a whole, this collection is better off to casual X-Files fans who don't want to shell out the cash for the full season sets.  All in all, like the two volumes before it, Colonization is a decent purchase for casual X-Files fans that are just interested in the show's mythology (the stand alone episodes that the show is renowned for are not included in any of the Mythology sets), but for those who already own the various full season sets, this is completely worthless.",1127260800,5,1235,4.843601895734597
2332490,5,B0009X7646,"I think the absence of CHRISTMAS CAROL/EMILY is purely a space decision/concern - there are 60 episodes total (15 on each set) and some had to go (DEMONS is another casualty). For what it's worth, the crucial information that's missing is contained in a flashback scene from Season 8's PER MANUM:

***

SCULLY: I was left unable to conceive with whatever test that they did on me. And I am not ready to accept that I will never have children.

(MULDER looks down as the elevator dings and the doors open into the basement. He walks out, then turns back to the elevator.)

MULDER: Scully, there's, um, there's something I haven't told you either and I hope you, uh, forgive me and understand why I would have kept it from you.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: During my investigation into your illness I found out the reason why you were left barren. Your ova were taken from you and stored in a government lab.

SCULLY: What?

(SCULLY is looking at him in shock. The elevator doors begin to close, but she puts up her hand to stop them.)

SCULLY: You found them?

Yes, I'd prefer the EMILY episodes were included, too, but at least the most basic information is still there. Well, except that Emily herself existed. As much as I enjoy ""new"" XF product like this, what we really want is a new XF feature film!",1126483200,,1304,4.483050847457627
2332491,4,B0009X7646,"I am absolutely furious that they ""forgot"" to put the Emily's episodes in this set !!

Those tow episodes are so important in the mythology !!

That's where we learn that Scully can't have children due to her abduction... and so much more !!

It is quiet a shock to me ! (yeah, I'm a big fan ;) ).

And those episodes are related to season eight/ nine (William....). I mean, it is really too bad !

Shame on Fox who wanted 60 episodes to explain the mythoilogy ! 60 is apparently much more better than 62...

Today, I'm sad ! :)

Of course, the rest of the episodes are just ""amazingly"" great.

4 stars just for the amazing 'Requiem'.(And it is where they should have stop the serie)... ;)",1126224000,5,689,4.246153846153846
2332492,4,B0009X7646,"I still have my complaints about this odd series of DVD sets from Fox. The basic idea isn't a bad one under the right circumstances: take all of the mythology episodes from THE X-FILES and group them in four inexpensive sets that leave out the stand alone episodes in order to tell ""the X-Files story."" I'm still not quite sure who the target audience for these sets is. Neophytes will be missing the standalone episodes that are just as typical of the series as the mythology episodes (and that represent many of the finest episodes), and serious fans already have all these episodes. To sum up, here are my complaints:

1. Instead of providing some inexpensive Mythology sets, FOX Entertainment should instead have focused on cutting the exorbitant prices of the complete season sets. They should provide us with sets that list around $59.95, so that places like Amazon can sell them at initial offerings of $38.

2. The sets come with minimal extras, largely recycling the special features from the original boxed DVD sets.

3. While the Mythology sets serve a function by calling attention to the seasons-long story arc, they hurt by eliminating the standalone episodes, which are just as crucial to developing the Mulder-Scully chemistry as the Mythology episodes.

4. In the end, the sets feel like an attempt to milk X-FILE fans who are anxious for new material while waiting and hoping for a new feature length film.

Nonetheless, I can support the idea of these sets for two reasons. First, they do help focus attention on the alien colonization story arc that runs through the various seasons of THE X-FILES. Second, they are very cheap.

Unfortunately, after this third set, things go downhill pretty quickly. I absolutely love THE X-FILES, and even loved Season Eight after Duchovny largely left the show, and much of Season Nine after he was gone entirely (though his memory lingered on). But the fourth set will be dedicated to the Super Soldiers story arc, and that was the one truly awful thing that ever occurred in THE X-FILES. The story arc that ended with the destruction of the cooperative efforts with the aliens striving to colonize earth left the show without much structure in Season Seven, so I can understand the desire to reintroduce structure with a new story arc. Unfortunately, the Super Soldiers simply didn't work, partly because they were a little too powerful (though they did find a kind of kryptonite that worked against them), and partly because the show was running out of gas when they were introduced, and no one seemed to want to try and make them interesting. Once the main arc that dominated the show from the first season until the very beginning of Season Seven came to an end, the show largely drifted from one standalone episode to another. Some familiar characters reappeared from time to time, like the Cigarette Smoking Man, and we got some alien episodes, but for all intents and purposes the main arc came to an end in ""Amor Fati"" in Season Seven. Everything after that has a tacked on feeling to it.

The importance of THE X-FILES in popularizing very long story arcs simply cannot be overstated. I've argued in several places that one reason that the ceiling for what television is capable of doing has been raised so high has resulted from the successive contributions of TWIN PEAKS, THE X-FILES, and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, the first by showing that television was capable of telling riveting narratives, the second by exciting us with multi-season story arcs, and the third by keeping the multi-season story arcs, but shifting the main concern from plot to character development. The first three (but not the fourth) of the Mythology sets help make the case for this important contribution THE X-FILES has made to the history of television.",1123113600,54,3800,4.8730650154798765

8069091,5,B0009X7646,"Patient X resumes the mythology story arc left off by Redux Part I I with Mulder being misled into believing that alien abductions constitutes an elaborate Government conspiracy against the American people by using them as test subjects for an elaborate scheme to develop biological weapons against the Soviets and totally discrediting his deeply held beliefs regarding extraterrestrial existence and discounting the testimony of Cassandra, an alien abductee, who, through the help of his former hypnotherapist, Dr. Werber, has managed to recover memories of her abductions,  in the same manner that Dr. Werber managed to assist Mulder to recover memories of his sister's abduction, which he now renounces as false memories. Meanwhile, Cassandra engages in a uncannily detailed recount of the sensations that Scully's abductions have left on her person, leading her to question Mulder's current lack of faith in the memories which he has long held to be true; while Marita and Alex Krycek uncover the plot by an alien rebel force attempting to thwart attempts at colonization of the planet by disfiguring themselves to prevent infection by the black oil that the colonists utilize to infect others to possess those they infect, and with the capture of an alien rebel, MJ12 decide that resistance might be possible and consider resistance against colonization for they discover that Krycek has infected an eyewitness to the alien rebel forces incineration of the aliens plotting colonization of earth in collusion with Marita which they had hoped to use as a bargaining chip and failing to do so were unable to conceal the fact that the Soviets had discovered an antidote that might enable resistance against colonization and that the fetus of an alien human hybrid which they have been collaborating with the alien colonists to develop without ever hoping to achieve success had become a reality. Meanwhile, Cassandra is bewildered that all the abductees who have gathered at Skyline Mountain, the beacon for extraterrestrial contact have been incinerated and solicits Mulder and Scully's help to stop the massacre. Scully follows Cassandra to Skyland Mountain and witnesses an extraterrestrial craft that has her believing Cassandra's account of her abduction experiences only to discover herself and Cassandra being abducted with only herself being returned to the scene of the massacre with no memory of her experiences.

The Red and the Black resumes the story arc with Mulder discovering Scully at the site of the massacre with no recollection of how she got there nor what transpired and having Mulder convince her to undergo hypnoregressive therapy to uncover her memories which are then recorded on tape with Mulder discounting the memories as confabulations,  while Skinner and Scully both feel that the extraterrestrial hypothesis to be the most plausible explanation; while MJ12 infect Marita with the black oil in the hope that introducing the vaccine to her immune system will enable resistance to no avail and finding that the only alien rebel they had captured has escaped,  with Mulder close on his trail, and witnessing an extraterrestrial craft hovering above the truck he and the alien rebel were on and discovering the rebel being incinerated by the colonists, an incident that severely shakes his new found belief in a government conspiracy and leads him back to the acceptance of the extraterrestrial existence.

The mythology story arc from The Red and the Black comes to a conclusion with Two Fathers and One Son. In Two Fathers, CBG - who has been manouvering to have his son take over the X-Files after a fire had burned down Mulder's Office, in an effort to discredit Mulder's work, and having Mulder reassigned to mundane tasks, finds his son seeking Mulder's help to investigate his mother's mysterious reappearance after her abduction and seeking to get Mulder to dissuade his mother of her ideas of alien abduction which he finds difficult to accept, only to have his father assign him to kill the alien rebel who is attempting to jeopardize MJ12's attempts to collude with the alien colonists by buying time to discover an antidote which will allow resistance and attempting to create an alien human hybrid to create slaves to facilitate colonization,  which finds success in CBG's wife,  Cassandra, and finding Spencer, CGB's son, have his specticism with regard to extraterrestrial life and the abduction scenario deeply shaken; while Mulder and Scully discover the secret agenda for colonization from Cassandra - who request to be killed prior to her capture by the DOD,  in order to prevent colonization from ever materializing.

 In One Son,  the story arc continues with Mulder and Scully being taken into a choreographed quarantine by the DOD - the pretext provided by Diana (Mulder's ex-girlfriend), to assume custody of Cassandra, when armed military men wearing contamination suits burst into Mulder's apartment prior to Mulder's attempt to kill Cassandra (at her request in order to prevent colonization); with CBG intruding into Mulder's apartment uninvited (after his release from the military facility where he was being detained) and revealing the whole truth about the secret agenda of MJ12 to collude with the aliens to create an alien human hybrid in order to buy time to work on a vaccine against infection by the black oil and prevent colonization by extracting the DNA from the fetus of an extraterrestrial biological entity (which they were using to assist the aliens to create an alien human hybrid which would serve as slaves for the alien colonists), and discovering that his father was part of MJ12 and initially objected to the idea of colluding with the alien's to develop an alien human hybrid by sacrificing one of his children - which the alien's demanded from each member of MJ12, so that they could experiment with these children to combine human DNA with alien DNA to create an alien human hybrid, resulting in the abduction of Mulder's sister, Samantha, due to the fact that he refused to surrender one of his children to the aliens.

This, the third set, resolved many of the mysteries from the earlier seasons.  A conspiracy involving collaboration with alien invaders was uncovered, while the conspirators found their unearthly allies to be unreliable partners, and a new element, rebel aliens was introduced.  The X-Files movie, Fight the Future, which was released about the same time, explored the same themes.  Paradoxically, by resolving one of the key plot lines, these episodes set the stage for the decline, and eventual end of the series.  Some of these episodes were outstanding.  Others, however, were overly mystical.  In the coming seasons, David Duchovny's role would be written out of the scripts, while Gillian Anderson's role would be diminished.  The series would soldier on for two more seasons, but with dissimilar plots.",1361923200,3,969,5.364238410596027
