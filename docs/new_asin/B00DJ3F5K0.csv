8593641,3,B00DJ3F5K0,Kind of choppy and the Winter ride scenery is boring as all get out. Not all bad as the views riding through the towns reminded me of my own travels in France.,1419379200,,159,4.0
8593642,5,B00DJ3F5K0,Wonderful DVD ! It has uphills and downhills . Great for making my own intense workout. By the end of the DVD I was panting out of breath. I love the scenery.,1406419200,,158,3.96875
8593643,3,B00DJ3F5K0,"Love indoor cycling tours with my spouse but this one is not one of my faves!  So sorry.  :-(  Really looked forward to getting this one but was disappointed in the awful,'twangy' guitar music; of course you can mute the sound.  The pro of course were the beautiful sceneries, that is why only 3 stars!  Liked the identified locations;  snow scenes and vistas however and thankful not to see biker ahead throughout the video.",1405900800,,425,4.675675675675675
8593644,4,B00DJ3F5K0,When I ride indoors I like to at least imagine I'm outdoors riding. It has a realistic view of riding outdoors and France.,1399334400,,122,4.3478260869565215
8593645,5,B00DJ3F5K0,"Beautiful ride through the French countryside that made for a pleasant workout indoor workout session.

The scenery could have come off the works of great artists. There were vineyards, small villages, castles, and great views. There was a variety of road widths and styles, sometimes lined with snow.

The roads varied. Sometimes we would come to a place with several choices. We would pause for a moment and go left to a castle or other site, and then return to try the road on the right. It made me feel as if I weren't missing anything, since on most DVDs there are little roads going off here and there and I always wonder where they are going.

Occasionally we might see a person or two, and only a very few cars. A little reminder came on occasionally that it has been 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc. It was timed perfectly to encourage me, since my bike also reminded me that I had completed 60% of the ride, etc. I need all the encouragement I can get to keep going.

I am looking forward to more of these videos created by Carre Productions, Natalie and Jeff Carre, who make amazing DVDs to work out with. I understand they have a new one about Paris. I can't wait to try it out.",1385856000,3,1185,4.372727272727273
8593646,5,B00DJ3F5K0,"Carre Productions' ""Beaujolais Winter Ride"" is a trip through the French wine country, as well as a historic & architectural lesson for travel enthusiasts.  And, you can do this while enjoying an at-home workout regime.  Enjoy your own Tour de France while building your biceps and quads in a pristine setting in Europe. The photography/videography of the rolling hills of the Beaujolais countryside is breathtaking. Who needs a passport and the itinerary headaches when you can save money and travel time by taking a virtual trip to France? What a great way to unwind, meditate and relax while also burning calories.  Very clever and magnifique!  I think I'll book a video trip for a few friends as well!",1382659200,4,705,4.9491525423728815
