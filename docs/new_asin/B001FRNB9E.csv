3588299,5,B001FRNB9E,it was really good suspense very good of how robin tunney felt after being raped and how she handled it,1356220800,,103,4.2
3588300,3,B001FRNB9E,"Open Window looks like a made-for-television film,but it tackles a traumatic event with relative nuance. Soon after a professor Peter (Joel Edgerton) proposes to his photographer girlfriend Izzy (Robin Tunney), she is raped by an intruder. Izzy slips into depression and gradually exposes the truth to friends and family. The movie is unusual in that it tracks the reactions of those around her, showing that they, too, are in a kind of shock. Even the best friends misread the situation or don't know what to say.

The script is also ambitious in its exploration of how a violation can bring up past griefs. We see both Izzy's and Peter's strained relationships with their parents and catch glimpses of their professional lives. Robin Tunney is very believable, and Joel Edgerton gives a relatively sensitive performance. Unfortunately, Izzy's obnoxious mother (Cybill Shepherd) comes across as a caricature, though she eventually reveals hidden layers. Izzy's father (Elliott Gould) is more kindhearted but rather lackluster. Several awkwardly acted scenes are further dulled by the bland cinematography. I won't even ask how the young couple can afford such remarkable housing.

The film might have an air of mediocrity, and it doesn't exactly punch you in the gut. Nonetheless, it is an improvement over, for example, David Schwimmer's supposedly true to life film Trust (2010) which busts myths about sexual assault with remarkable heavy-handedness. Open Window is an unexpectedly subtle and realistic portrayal of the complicated recovery after a terrifying attack.",1344988800,5,1571,5.408163265306122
3588301,1,B001FRNB9E,"Had the feel of poorly done made for TV movie. Cybil was horrendous! Overacting as usual, and melodramatic to a flaw. Elliot Gould in another role with all the charisma of cardboard. Husband was a tool and Tierney actually seemed to enjoy the pathetic rape scenes. Ignore all reviews! You will be very disappointed in the sloppy, long, drawn-out mess with unbelievable scene after another. Acting beyond lousy.",1325894400,3,410,5.044117647058823
3588302,4,B001FRNB9E,"Mia Goldman both wrote and directed this fine little film that deals with the butterfly effect of an event affecting a whole family.  The subtlety of the film is enhanced by unforced, subtle performances by a solid cast and further enhanced by a quality of filming (cinematographer Dennis Maloney)  that creates disturbing images without obsessing over them.

Photographer Izzy (Robin Tunney) is deeply in love with Peter (Joel Edgerton) whose lives are brutally assaulted when Izzy is raped.  Unable to cope with the concept and in the midst of a healing phase, Izzy and Peter breakup, consoled by Izzy's mother Arlene (Cybil Shepherd) and father John (Elliott Gould).  Once the incident that is the driver of this story is revealed and discussed, the ramifications are bitter.  How Izzy and Peter survive the ordeal is beautifully and subtly written and acted.  Cameo roles by Scott Wilson and Shirley Knight add depth to the story.  This film has some very disturbing moments, but the subject of rape has always and will always be a disturbing topic.  How writer/director Goldman handles this is one of the finest moments on film.

It is a pleasure to see Robin Tunney, best known now for her ongoing role on televisions 'The Mentalist', tackle a role so demanding and make us stay with her character all the way.  Joel Edgerton is also exception in a tough role.  In all, this is one of those unnoticed films that deserves a larger audience.  Grady Harp, April 11",1303689600,11,1467,4.866935483870968

3588304,5,B001FRNB9E,"I love the actress Robin Tunney in anything she appears in. Although this particular movie has a very strong message for all who have ever been raped. Tunney performed excellently as a victim of such a horrific crime. She possesses a personal quality not only making her a great actor but giving her the ability to transform herself into that role. The Writer/Director, Mia Goldman, being a victim herself many years prior to the making of this movie,(""Open Window"") expressing in her own words a very emotional story only adding an certain understanding of the part being portrayed by Tunney. A terrific movie.",1293926400,13,611,4.941747572815534

life changes for her and her boy friend.

I liked the movie.",1265414400,9,220,4.261904761904762
3588306,5,B001FRNB9E,"In Greek mythology there is a story of a young lass whom many considered to be the most beautiful woman of her time. She boasted golden tresses being the most elegant in all of Greece.
One day, she goes to worship at a temple of Athena. While there, she is raped by Poseidon. Athena is enraged, but she cannot do anything to retaliate against the god of the sea as he is a more powerful deity than she is. So, the goddess of wisdom decides to take out her wrath on the young woman who had the ""audacity"" to blaspheme her temple by being raped within its folds.
Athena's retribution is particularly harsh: she turns her beautiful tresses into snakes and makes her face so hideous that anyone who gazes upon her will instantly turn to stone. The woman's name, of course, is Medusa. Everyone knows about her having snakes for hair, but far fewer people are aware of her backstory.
In short, Medusa's story is symbolic of all rape victims. Transforming her appearance from an elegant young maiden into a monster is a metaphor for 2 things that consistently happen in rape cases from ancient times to the present day: blaming the victim and the psychological and emotional scars that carry over long after the attack is over with.
In the present film, Robin Tunney portrays a woman who is forced to bear such scars, especially the latter one. JUST when her life is coming together with a successful career and a ""nice guy"" fiance, she is raped in her own home. It is a violation (X 2) that leaves her traumatized.
Robin Tunney turns in the best performance of her career in one of her few lead roles. Anyone who watches this film cannot help but gain empathy for her character (Isabelle) as she tries to put the pieces back together and get back to some sense of normalcy.
This is an important movie, a worthwhile movie,a powerful story but not a happy story. Be forewarned that the film examines one of the most grotesque subjects there is. Rape is right up there with murder, torture and genocide in being one of the most heinous crimes one can possibly commit. Anyone who thinks that sexual assault is simply ""boys just being boys"" should be compelled to view this movie.",1426809600,,2169,4.549872122762149

3588311,4,B001FRNB9E,"Rape is a horror, Robin Tunney plays it with the void of emotion one might think would be the case. She is a beautiful woman best known for her TV roles .. and the young vamp in some movies. Here it is a real woman and she nails it ... Chilling story... but it is a real love story.",1372982400,2,282,3.7966101694915255
3588312,3,B001FRNB9E,"Took to long to get to the point & the main actress was to negative.
Not too of a good story",1363478400,,92,3.4285714285714284
3588313,3,B001FRNB9E,The subject was disturbing but this was a good example o f how hurt people can withdraw into themselves or fixate on a tragedy. It also shows how rape affects some women and those around them.,1362787200,3,192,4.361111111111111
3588314,3,B001FRNB9E,"Okay, it's a good movie in that it deals well with the subject of rape - meaning it seems realistic and the rape scene is done in such a way that it's not too graphic and not all at once.  I'm still not sure how much Robin Tunney can act - I want to like her - in her own way she reminds me of Wynona Ryder but less emotional and maybe that's the problem..the less emotional part - she always seems like she's either contemplating what laxative to take or if she should be taking a nap.  But despite whet I perceive to be her at times wooden acting ability - the movie is decent - Cybil Shepards Mom/passive aggressive type is a bit over the top but she's Cybil Shephard she can pull it off.  I kind of find the characters selfish - and passing each other by like ships in the night BUT she was just raped.  Who wants to be all light hearted after that?  What was hard for me is that she had the luxury of NOT having to go back to work after being raped - she's a photographer - which we all know means - unless you are a famous one means ur either poor or have private income.  I doubt many women who have had such a terrible thing happen to them have been able to take such a respite...but I know that's not really the point but these and other little things annoyed me about the movie.  But that could be because I'm currently pretty low on money, don't like my job and don't have a cute fiancee like the guy (Joel Edgerton) in the movie - check him out in the movie Warriors where he plays a retire boxer -- he's excellent.

3588315,5,B001FRNB9E,I thought this movie was very good at showing how traumatic events don't just effect the person they happen to.  It shows how these events effect the people who love the one who experienced the trauma and how each of these people has to learn to overcome in their own way.  I think it also shows how that when each individual seeks healing for themselves that is what enables them to help others heal.,1358121600,2,401,4.405405405405405

8302456,4,B001FRNB9E,"I love Joel Edgerton so I rented this movie.  Was a good movie, except for the crazy distracting background music (why?).  I thought it was a really realistic portrayal of post traumatic stress after being attacked.  It wasn't corny and seemed to be written from a women's perspective.  I wasn't crazy about the actress before this movie and am now a fan, she did a great job. If you are a Joel Edgerton fan you will like this, if you are a women that has been a victim of rape you will appreciate how well this movie is done and the way they edit in the attack scenes as flashbacks and don't sexualize rape. You fear for her the director does not objectify her in any way.  The way it is filmed you feel like you are in the room with actors, very intimate.

8302458,3,B001FRNB9E,"I absolutely love Joel Edgerton (s/p?). I wish he'd do more movies with his natural accent. Not sure why no one on a US show or movie can have an accent.
I bought this movie. And I'm sure I'll watch it again later than sooner. I couldn't take Mia's self centered, it's all about me attitude. In real life there would be so many different options that could help her. And yes I do know what I'm talking about. Lived through it myself. So I would wish for her to get more therapy, or couples therapy. Thier relationship seemed like they could do it. A better ending would have been nice. Pretty much there's about 5 minutes of happiness, then it hits a brick wall the Mia can't knock down. Then again, I don't think she wanted help. Just pity.",1465948800,,741,4.3

8302461,4,B001FRNB9E,"I rewatched this movie, and while Ms. Tunney's performance, and it is based on the writer/director, is great, she's surrounded by great support, beginning with Joel Edgerton, as the guy she wants to marry, but with whom she grows distant, after the rape, as well as supporting roles by Elliot  Gould, and a ""mature"" but still attractive Cybill Shepard (contrary to Ms. Candace Bergin, we guys do notice women of mature years that hold up), as her mother.  Ms. Tunney is a woman you want to protect, and her boyfriend's reaction is understandable.  Rape is a heinous crime, and it affects not only the victim, but those around her.  It is good they put a PSA at the end about it.  No one should have to suffer the act.  The director/writer tells her story which inspired this movie, as an extra feature.  Tough to watch, but an important look at a terrible crime.",1432598400,,862,4.594771241830065
8302462,5,B001FRNB9E,"I'm doing research on rape recovery for a chapter in my upcoming book, Heroine's Journey, and the organization RAINN suggested this was a good movie to watch.

Rather than talk about the acting and cinematography, which was great, I prefer to talk about the story itself.

I believe this is a good movie to watch because it shines light on the many different aspects of recovery, that, speaking for myself, I never realized. From loved ones acting as if they are the victims, to having to hide the truth from others so as to not inconvenience them, and the shame and blame the raped victim feels towards his or herself: in this movie Izzy is the victim.

To make things worse, well meaning friends and family try to ignore what happened or go about telling Izzy what she needs to do, or worse, what's wrong with her: it's heartbreaking. On top of being raped and having to deal with the continued physical violation of being probed, tested, and vaccinated for diseases, there is the guilt of somehow being at fault for being raped coupled with the guilt projected by others in Izzy's life for her making them feel uncomfortable: the dinner scene with friends really brings this point out.

The slow, but gradual process Izzy goes though as she gains control over her life mirrors how it is for many victims in real life. Though, from my research, there are no set ways or time frames in which a person recovers, nor, sadly, is recovery always possible.

I cannot pretend to know what it is like to be raped, though, I have sadly witnessed it in prison and have known people that it's been done to. I can only pray that they have good people in their lives, like Izzy did in the movie, to help lend them strength and support.

This movie will not be for everyone. It is somewhat slow, sad, and boring for those who are looking for a classical Hollywood film. If you do find yourself watching it, and I hope you do, if for no other reason, to become more aware of the suffering some people experience in their lives, I pray that it will help you, if you are a victim, to find ways to heal, and if you are someone who knows someone that has been violated, that it will help you find ways to be there for them.

Life sucks sometimes. There is no way around that. I just appreciate it when film makers make an effort to bring attention to some of the real suffering people go through in life.",1430438400,,2387,4.42369020501139
