8737653,1,B016ZGY7ME,Purple strap on dildos? Main characters who murder people? A brother who knocks up his sister? How are we supposed to feel sorry for any of these people? I was cheering for the killer to hack these morons up. I've seen pornos with a better plot.,1453507200,4,245,4.3478260869565215

8737655,5,B016ZGY7ME,"Bastard is not like any slasher film  that I ever seen. The film is dark, gritty, seriously violent and mean-spirited. It's a 80's styled slasher film that packs a huge punch for hardcore horror hounds. The directors and writer, Powell Robinson and Patrick R. Young did an excellent job with the pacing, death scenes, writing, characters and dialogue. If the makers of this film had a terrific shot at Bastard, they should make a giallo styled slasher film called ""The House That Breathes"". Bastard is a horror film that has it's own rules and rights. If you like hardcore slasher films like this, check it out now.",1449360000,4,615,4.747663551401869
8737656,4,B016ZGY7ME,"It really has no setting beyond the typical slasher movie idea, but fortunately the movie still manages to stand out. It does so by having actual characters with backstories. It also has some pretty awesome kills. Where the movie falters a bit is in the pace. It cant quite strike the balance of telling a story while also having actual occurrences, meaning much of it is pretty dry and awfully slow when people aren't getting butchered. The acting is just okay, which didn't really help it to not be dry. Some clever innovation in a horribly oversaturated sub-genre, but a little too uneven to be called great. Still really enjoyable though. 3.5/5",1448668800,7,648,4.794642857142857
