8112204,4,B000EOU4MG,Good workout for older adults.,1425686400,,30,5.2
8112205,5,B000EOU4MG,I just started to use the Geri-fit workout. I am only 59 yrs old and on the DVD they have people in their 60's. It's a good start for someone who has never weight trained. It starts out with 2 pound weights but I will probalby be using 3 pounds and up before too long.  Some of the exercises use a chair which is a nice break. And the stretching exercises in the beginning and the end are easily done.,1395705600,,401,4.0125
8112206,3,B000EOU4MG,I was expecting a different version of this DVD like one that we had before and liked and used.  We lost it when we moved.  It had a group of people in the background doing the exercise along with the leader.  The version we got is condensed and has only the leader describing the exercises. Is the other one not available?,1392681600,,323,4.262295081967213
8112207,5,B000EOU4MG,"Great exercises for seniors, which satisfy varying levels of fitness.  I would highly recommend this workout with weights!
Something for everyone.",1391558400,,146,5.9523809523809526
8112208,1,B000EOU4MG,"Although I have done aerobics for many years, this is good because it strengthens parts of the body that need it as we get older.",1380067200,,129,4.2
8112209,4,B000EOU4MG,Did this about 10 years ago in my 40's.  Now at 55 and out of shape a bit of a challenge.  Be careful and use no weights to 1 lb weights to start.,1368921600,,146,3.393939393939394
8112210,5,B000EOU4MG,"I alternate days with yoga, treadmill and this workout. It fits in well to get a good variety to work different muscles and to be doing something different every day.",1363996800,,166,4.566666666666666
8112211,5,B000EOU4MG,"I borrowed this several years ago from my local library. I loved it so much that I purchased the VCR tape and
later the DVD when they became available. This is a perfect video for anyone who wants to learn to build and
tone your muscles. It is an easy one and the people on the DVD are senior citizens themselves. Some of the
exercises are done using a chair, some standing and some on the floor. If you use it faithfully, you will probably
drop a size or two as your muscles become toned. It is possible you will lose weight as well if you watch your
eating habits. I have bought these for friends. It works!",1347494400,3,609,4.169491525423729
8112212,4,B000EOU4MG,"I'm eighty-four years old.  Having used the Video tape with a small group of Seniors for many years and gained in strength and flexibility, I was happy to obtain the DVD when my VCR finally packed up. I can honestly say that the benefits have been most noticeable.  For instance, when I accidentally dropped some change from my purse the other day I didn't think twice about bending down and picking it up.  Also, I can easily get up from my seat and walk to the market.",1330905600,3,470,4.379310344827586
