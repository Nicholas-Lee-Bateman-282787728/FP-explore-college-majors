Although it was a bit on the corny side for adults, it seemed like a good movie for our older grandchildren (5, 6 and 7). They all loved it!  This movie has now become a must-see on subsequent visits.",1403568000,,269,3.9814814814814814
8568036,5,B0006U5UYA,"I kid you not, this is my favorite movie, and I'm 23 (loved it since I was like 12!) The movie is very well cast, each character is truly a character, the writers, actors and crewmemberstake a far-fetched premise and make it utterly convincing. I agree with the other review, this is an infinitely-charming movie, a fun watch every time.

Do not heed the IMDB ratings on this one, they paint it as some sort of E.T. clone, which it is not. Also, it's not a bubble-gum family flick, even though it's PG they push the language to the limits ^.^

Do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection.",1354924800,,600,4.348214285714286
