8048037,5,B0007LCIMA,A good attempt to tell the Jackie Cochran story. Entertaining but only touches on the highlights of a great pilots career. Worth watching.,1410739200,,138,5.043478260869565
8048038,4,B0007LCIMA,"Having an interest in aircraft and those who fly them I was ashamed of myself that I didn't know anything about Jackie Cochran except that she was an aviatrix of insignificant status. Everyone knows Amelia Earhart and when I was young Amy Johnson was the darling of aviation in Australia. After educating myself I can easily imagine this lady being friends with Chuck Yeager because they shared something wonderful, a willingness to go that little bit further that takes you out front of the herd and enables you to see a life that is anything but mundane. We will never know how thin the ice is until we raise the courage to step out on to it and take the risk. A Biblical Step in Faith.
Looking back on a life very ordinary by comparison I can only hope I meet Jackie in another life somewhere and get to shake her hand. Those of us who have been able to go aloft in a small airplane and experience the thrill of going outside our square will all appreciate Jackie's story, those who haven't should do so at their earliest convenience.",1373068800,,1037,4.463157894736842
