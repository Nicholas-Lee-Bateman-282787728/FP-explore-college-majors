5118443,4,B0081JI06S,Some parts are just too overdone. Repeating s***s  over and over from different views gets a little old pretty quick. Very impressive video nonetheless.,1425081600,,152,5.333333333333333
5118444,5,B0081JI06S,"Like all of the DVDs offered by Twisterchasers (I've seen them all and recommend each one as a must see) this one doesn't disappoint, in fact this may be the best in the Twisterchasers series, not because of the tornado footage (they all offer dramatic storm chasing excitement) but this DVD also portrays and demonstrates the aftermath of the Joplin tornado!  You won't find more real and dramatic video of Mother Nature at her fiercest anywhere else!  I strongly recommend ordering each one of the Twisterchasers DVD's, but if you must choose 1, I'd order this DVD to start!",1419811200,,576,4.808080808080808
5118445,5,B0081JI06S,"Excellent account of the horrific carnage in Joplin by experienced storm chasers.  The video includes touching first person stories told by individuals caught up in the aftermath of this deadly twister.  I found myself on the verge of tears for the suffering in the stricken city.  On a lighter note, the viewer is treated to some husband-wife interplay as Jeff and Kathryn Piotrowski briefly argue over how close to approach the behemoth.  I am with Ms Kathryn:  I would be saying ""back up!"" as well!
The Piotrowskis not only filmed breathtaking images of the storm, but they also jumped in to help the survivors in the aftermath.  They are really good folks whom anyone would like to have for neighbors.
Their film is definitely effective: I recently showed this video to a friend and she remarked that she would never take storm warnings casually again.  Recommended highly for those interested in this historic tornado.",1407369600,3,923,4.954545454545454

In the evening, after a long, sweaty day repairing her house, our small team viewed the incredible visual account. We watched as the tornado destroyed part of Joplin, and we saw the house we were working on!!  Emotional? Yeah! Incredible? Yeah! Tears and shudders? Yeah!

8523965,5,B0081JI06S,"This video was put together by two storm chasers who were in Joplin, MO during the tornado. The first part of the film contains footage of the storm chasers driving in and around Joplin during the actual storm. The remainder includes interviews with several residents who survived the storm. Very powerful film. I would recommend this for anyone who is interested in learning about the human aspect of how the storm affected the community.",1501027200,,439,4.945945945945946

Not only with the intense filming of the event, but of their rush to help the poor victims of this horrible tornado. I really enjoyed both angles of the events shot by Jeff and Kathryn. It shows the awful reality of it all. I love that some of the survivors got their stories told and added their own insights on the event. This is a day that will always be remembered. This is an awesome dvd!",1471564800,,468,4.269662921348314

8523969,4,B0081JI06S,"My 7 yr. old son is interested in tornados. He watches Tornado Alley on Weather Ch., so he wanted something on Joplin.
He was enthralled by it. I still do not like the idea of him wanting to be a storm chaser. Hoping it is just a phase. ;-)",1468022400,,240,3.9183673469387754
8523970,4,B0081JI06S,"Bought this as I live a few miles from Joplin and remember the day well. Had many family members affected by the tornado, including a sister who lost nearly everything but was safe away from Joplin at the time. Was a bit hard to watch as I knew people involved in the tornado and knew the locations in it too well. I frequent many of the businesses destroyed. Glad I got to see it, but not sure I would watch again.",1466640000,,415,4.135802469135802

8523972,5,B0081JI06S,"Recently purchased this DVD and watched it. Great video, good accounts about this particularly damaging F-5 tornado and I thought it was worth the money, which was not badly priced here.",1445126400,,186,5.032258064516129
8523973,3,B0081JI06S,"The three stars are deceiving but let me explain.

First, the DVD is produced very well and tells a great story regarding Jeff and Kathryn Piotroski's journey into Joplin and are the only chasers who were able to capture some unbelievable and fantastic footage of this tornado (most of the chaser community was in Oklahoma that day excluding Basehunters Chasing who caught the formation of the tornado on the southwest side of town and Roger Hill's Silver Lining tour group who were chased out of Joplin by the tornado).  There are many, many angles of this tornado they took (often repeated over and over) and the survivor stories and are very dramatic and well worth the purchase of the DVD.  The only real complaint I can give about it is that it doesn't show other people's views of the tornado but then obviously this DVD was only meant to highlight Jeff and Kathryn's footage.  (The best alternative to their DVD might be ""Witness: Joplin Tornado"" which aired on National Geographic but is easily viewed on YouTube - it also contains some of Jeff and Kathryn's footage).

Here's where I have the problem though.  This DVD only tells part of the story.  They make note that this is one of the deadliest tornadoes in the history of the United States.  Many people get hooked in the hyperbole here - this is one of the deadliest tornadoes in history but only ranks seventh overall in the top ten deadliest single tornadoes as of the writing of this review (2015).  One thing not explored here is why?  Why was this tornado so deadly?  What happened?  What went wrong?  Interestingly enough, they do interview Keith Stammer, the then director of Joplin Emergency Management and he gives no explanation as to why he sounded the sirens the way he did nor why they were not operating when the tornado was hitting town.

As a companion piece to this DVD, I highly recommend Mike Smith's monograph ""When The Sirens Were Slient: How The Warning System Failed A Community"".  Find out, as Jeff and Kathryn were driving through Joplin while the tornado hit, what was really happening and why so many needlessly died in this disaster.  Obviously, this DVD gives us the drama without the politics, but for those interested, there is much more involved with what happened in Joplin than just the storm hitting and the aftermath.

Thus, the three star rating is not because of the quality of the DVD, but simply for the fact that only part of the story is being told here.  Still recommended though for those interested in some great survival stories and excellent storm footage.",1426032000,3,2568,4.7325842696629215
