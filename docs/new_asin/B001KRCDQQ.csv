8315994,1,B001KRCDQQ,It was the perfect video that I would reccomend every phillies fan should have as part of phillies memory in phillies history. and I would rate this video a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.,1391731200,,182,3.945945945945946
8315995,3,B001KRCDQQ,"This DVD is wonderful, because it's produced by the Phillies for their annual video yearbook and has exclusive behind-the-scenes content. There are scenes which I had never saw before on TV or the internet of the 2008 championship season.

But, compared to the A&E 2008 World Series Box Set and the MLB-Produced 2008 World Series film DVD, I would not recommend purchasing this. The video quality, even in terms of standard-def DVD picture, is poor compared to the two products mentioned above. I would try to borrow this or rent it (if that's even possible in 2013) before deciding to buy this.",1362528000,,595,4.833333333333333
8315996,4,B001KRCDQQ,Nice video. The further we get from the final strike the better the memories become. The video definitely helps keep that alive.,1255564800,,128,4.863636363636363
