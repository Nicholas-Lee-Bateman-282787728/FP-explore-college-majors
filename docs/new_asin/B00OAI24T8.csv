6731433,5,B00OAI24T8,Excellent.  Corroborates many other scientific reviews on the subject.  Fascinating video.,1417651200,4,90,7.090909090909091
6731434,5,B00OAI24T8,"I would definitely get both part one and part two together.  Watched one after the other.  This is a fascinating project and I would highly recommend the DVDs.  I have no doubt that both remote viewers were blind to the target having followed the work of the Farsight Institute for a while now, and to see the data they both obtained is quite amazing.  I didn't know much about the guy in the portrait that Dick Allgire drew of the chief conspirator in part two so didn't know who it was straight away, but it only took me a few minutes to track down a Wikipedia page for the guy and when I found him I recognised him immediately - there was mistaking him - that was a stunning piece of remote viewing.  Nice work.",1416614400,8,714,4.2592592592592595

8683016,1,B00OAI24T8,"Remote Viewing during the time of President Reagan would never have rendered this kind of garbage. According to a proven professional viewer that I know, the towers were taken out just as the official record shows. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.

This kind of media garbage is why remote viewing is dead.",1489449600,,309,4.9423076923076925
8683017,5,B00OAI24T8,"Best remote view of 9/11, because much of the film regarding the planes hitting the twin towers were scripted by the major news media, or edited to show what the (U.S.) government wanted the populace to see.  Do your own research, as I have, and find out the truth for yourself.  It didn't go down the way the government said it did.  Too many lies!!!",1488326400,2,351,4.369230769230769

8683019,1,B00OAI24T8,"What?  This has got to be a joke.  What a complete waste of hard earned money.  Even if you're into the psychic thing, this is beyond stupid.  Buy if you want to see a guy drawing on a board for 30 minutes.",1455235200,,206,3.8333333333333335
8683020,5,B00OAI24T8,I didn't believe the official government version of this event then and I don't now. I will keep asking questions and support Farsight Institute in whatever way I can. Let freedom ring!!!,1453680000,4,187,4.875
8683021,5,B00OAI24T8,"Very interesting DVD. The US army used remote viewing for years, you have to see the interesting information the remote viewers ""see"" and how it fits in with the facts.",1437436800,4,168,4.633333333333334
