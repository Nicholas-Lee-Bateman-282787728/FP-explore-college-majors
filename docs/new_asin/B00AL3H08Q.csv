5448355,5,B00AL3H08Q,Seasons 1 and 2 were so fun and entertaining.  The rest of the seasons were less than great and the new wives were too crass.  But Season 2 is worth the money.,1404000000,3,159,3.9375
5448356,3,B00AL3H08Q,"It's frustrating to listen to Kyle, Camille and Adrienne talk about Taylor.

""I'm just baffled!
I have a friend who says her husband hits her.
Instead of spending 15 minutes learning about domestic violence, I've decided to remain ignorant on the subject.
While being filmed.
Over a period of time.
I won't learn anything to help me understand my friend who's in a life-threatening situation.
I'll just be baffled!
And wonder if she's a liar.""

""I'm not going to google 'battered women',
that would require 15 minutes of reading,
time I could be spending with my mirror.
I'd rather ponder, on television, about the possibility that my friend is a liar.""

Russell rages at Taylor in cycles, it takes some time to build up to a wife-punching episode.
After the explosion is released, Russell calms down and Taylor tries to be so 'good' that it won't happen again.
But of course it does, because it's not about Taylor.

Kyle, Camille and Adrienne think Taylor may be a liar because sometimes Taylor says her marriage is good, and other times says it's bad.

This cycle of calm and violence is common to wife-beaters and has been written about in countless books and articles since before Taylor and Russell were born.
Rather than read up-Kyle, Camille and Adrienne prefer to remain perplexed.

I wonder if the women (or 'girls', as they call themselves) are equally confused by seasons.
""It's like in winter, it's really, really cold, and then in summer, it's hot. I don't understand.
How can it be really, really hot and then like, really, really cold?
I don't get it.""

""I'm baffled!
My friend Taylor says her husband Russell hits her.
Russell doesn't slug her at my dinner parties.
I'm confused!
Wouldn't he punch her in the face in front of me?
He doesn't!
Gee whiz, that's got me stumped!""

Kyle actually believes that if Russell were beating up Taylor, he would do it in front of their friends.
She's confused that the violence isn't public.
Kyle, it's sad to see you try to think about something other than your hair.

The Beverly Brainless set Taylor up for a fresh assault.
The Wives block Taylor and Russell from entering the White Party.
Then Lobotomized Kyle says, ""Wait!"" and follows the Armstrongs as they get into their limo.

Kyle tells Russell that Camille repeated exactly what Taylor told them.
Now Russell knows that Taylor is telling Beverly Hills, and the world (via the reality show) that he hits her.

Taylor had tried to avoid getting her skull bashed in by telling Russell that Camille exaggerated what Taylor said.
No, says Kyle to Taylor-beating Russell, Camille did not exaggerate.

Great job, Kyle!
Now Taylor gets to go home with a humiliated, violent man.
What do you think might happen?
Still baffled?

The creators of RHOBH know.
They show us that they know by filming the front door of the Armstrong home closing after Taylor and Russell return.
They keep the camera fixed on the closed door.

Because everyone, except people who study their hair for a living, knows that men wait until they're in the privacy of their own home before they beat their wives' face in.

Whatever brains the gods blessed Kyle, Adrienne and Camille (""we don't see bruises on Taylor!"") with at birth have eroded from lack of use.
They don't understand that they put their friend in danger, and that speculating that Taylor could be a psychopathic liar (who else would lie that their husband beats them?) makes them look like uneducated idiots.

There's such a thing as continuing education classes at your local college.
Try to fit one in.",1395705600,3,3549,4.783960720130933

8553273,5,B00AL3H08Q,"Season two of RHOBH is probably my favorite, despite it being one of the most darkest and controversial seasons yet.

Taylor's marriage to Russell (who later committed suicide before the season started) appears to be in more trouble than ever.  Viewers only get to the outside looking in view as apparently there is domestic violence has occurring in their relationship and how Taylor is pretty unhinged throughout the season.  I think one of the most gut wrenching moments was during the tea party and Camille claimed because she never saw wounds on Taylor it made seem like she was lying.  Even Adrienne couldn't help but be preachy and judgey throughout most of the season about it. It was almost sad to see how uneducated they were on the issue of domestic violence.  Even if Russell didn't put hands on Taylor, emotional and verbal abuse could had happened.  Oy!  Women and men, please understand domestic violence isn't just physical but words have power too.  (Sidenote - Coincidentally, both Adrienne and Camille have been linked to domestic violence in later years).

Anyhow, Kim's substance abuse becomes more of the forefront as she finds a significant other shortly before shooting season 2.  Kyle shows concern over her sister and her choices after the previous season infamous limo ride explosion from both sisters.

Despite the darkness there is a joyous occasion in the works as Lisa helps plan for her daughter's Pandora's wedding.  Camille is also back and less bitchy.  Adrienne is in a ongoing competition with Lisa throughout most of the season.  We are also introduced to two friends of the wives in Dana-Pam and Brandi who both bring their means of fun.  I personally liked both but Dana with her ""Did you know? (Sunglasses) $25000.""  I liked how bubbly she was and how out of all the women she probably was the biggest support system and great friend for Taylor when she was going through her demons.

Great season worth the watch and purchase on DVD for any 'Wives fan!",1415836800,,1994,4.85207100591716
