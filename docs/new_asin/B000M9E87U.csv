8207677,5,B000M9E87U,"Over thirty years ago when I produced and shot this film, it was a very different time. When it was released, people loved it. But like anything from 30 years ago, it's now very dated. I have no idea how the cover ended up looking like it does. When the film was completed, the cover was the same as the book by the same name. I guess our international distributor didn't think it was ""sexy"" enough, so now there's a cover image that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Oh well, that's show biz!",1361923200,2,504,4.260416666666667
