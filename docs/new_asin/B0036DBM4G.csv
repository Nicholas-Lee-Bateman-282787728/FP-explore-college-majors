4076024,5,B0036DBM4G,My kids and I love the high five team and these dvd's didn't disappoint. It arrived quickly and we are thankful for that. These dvd's were of the last season of High Five which we've never had the chance to see. I was so happy it was sold on Amazon! We would buy from this supplier again.,1281225600,,288,4.0701754385964914

4076026,3,B0036DBM4G,"still amazes me how can some producers are missing the fact of the relevance of adding spanish to their titles. While our daughters are being taught in English as they are in Spanish....your missing a big chunk, when spanish is not offered as a language.",1279152000,3,254,4.666666666666667

8389878,4,B0036DBM4G,"My daughter loved Hi-5 in reruns so I purchased.  My only complaint about the product is it doesn't run on it's own so in a car DVD system you have to have someone in the back to hit the button or you will be listening to the beginning song as long as you can bear it :)

 The songs are just so catchy , sorry that this show is no longer on in the US.",1472947200,,351,3.6533333333333333

8389885,5,B0036DBM4G,"I was so excited to find out that they finally brought out all of the episodes of this show on DVD that I purchased all four seasons.  I only have three issues with all of them - one, that there is no episode list on the DVDs; two, they should really mix the song of the week episodes instead of lumping them all together (eg, if you watch five episodes of, say, TEAM, you hear that song ten times, one episode after another) so I would fast forward to the first skit or skip the end song; three, when you select ""episode selection"" in the root menu you only have four episodes to choose from (or did I miss something?) when the first three seasons have around twenty episodes each.

My 3-year-old sometimes asks me, ""Mommy I want to see Shaun Congo Congo Boom Boom Boom"", or ""I want to see Move Your Eyes, Move Your Eyes"" and I have to go through each one or just show her something else and hope she's satisfied.  Other than that, I often find myself watching them, even when she's not at home!!!  A great buy, and I've got absolutely no regrets!!!",1288742400,2,1050,4.261306532663316
