4854370,3,B005OQNOWG,"Most of the reviews here say little about the actual movie and more about the business practices of the production company ""The Asylum"". Yes, 11/11/11 is another of their ""mockbusters"", made to be released around the same time as ""11-11-11"", which is in theatres as of this writing. Some people say The Asylum are running a scam. I say people should pay more attention to  the product description when buying a movie so they don't buy the wrong one. You decide what you think is right.

Now, having said that and got it out of the way, I'll go on to review the actual movie.

Jack and Melissa Vales move with their 10-year-old son Nat to a new town where Jack's got a new job as a professor. Some of the neighbors act very strange and seem to be obsessed with the fact that Nat will turn 11 on 11/11/11. It's not long before people start dying mysteriously. Nice nanny Rhonda gets killed so her position can be taken by the sinister Denise. The neigbors are conspiring in secret meetings in vans, preparing for the big day when it seems something more than an ordinary birthday will occur.

The film is competently made, although the limited budget is evident in some scenes, especially those with special effects. The plot isn't new but it works and kept my interest throughout, was not entirely predictable and I liked the ending. ""11/11/11"" isn't great but it did its job of entertaining me during a sleepless night.",1321488000,4,1419,4.596837944664031

4854372,3,B005OQNOWG,"This film is topical, fastly paced and very intense.

4854373,1,B005OQNOWG,"Buyer beware: this is NOT the film that you've seen advertised on television (synopsis: ""An author travels to Barcelona to see his estranged brother and dying father, where he learns that his life is plagued by events that occur at 11:11"", taken from IMDB).

This is a low-budget, direct-to-video, ripoff hoping to trick people by using an almost identical film title and releasing it very shortly before the other film. notice this film uses slashes ""/"" between the numbers: 11/11/11. The other film (the cinema release) uses dashes ""-"" between the numbers: 11-11-11.

4854377,1,B005OQNOWG,"As noted by other reviewers, this is not the 11-11-11 film heavily advertised on television.  This is a low-budget knock-off that my husband rented from Redbox because he thought it was something else.  Trickster moviemakers.

Letting go of the fact that this movie is basically hoodwinking the public into renting or buying something that they're not... This movie is a stinker.  Judging completely on its own merits, it's fair to say that this movie HAS NO MERITS.

It does feature the 11:11 phenomenon as well as some 9/11 conspiracy theories, but mostly it's a no-budget movie that isn't worth watching or reviewing.  The acting is completely pathetic.  Directing and writing aren't any better.  The premise is ridiculous and whatever potential may have existed in the script has been choked to death.

It's not scary, it's not clever, it's not even cool in the way that overly cheesy horror movies can be.  This movie has no redeeming qualities.",1328572800,3,950,4.993630573248407
4854378,1,B005OQNOWG,"Disastrously bad horror flick about a family moving to a suburb where the neighbors are cheerful, people keep dying violent deaths that nobody seems to notice and their son will transform into the anti-christ on his eleventh birthday.  There's a good Stepford Wives style comedy in here somewhere about the banality of evil as these bland suburban types plan for the coming of the apocalypse while smiling and handing out cookies, but as a horror movie this thing is a complete train wreck.  The writing, acting, digital effects--pretty much everything that can be bad is very, very bad.  The conspirators keep killing their own off for letting details of their master plan slip yet they do nothing about the old woman who lives next door to the family and is the only person trying to stop the boy from becoming the anti-christ.  Like I said, this could have been a pretty good comedy.  11/11/11 borrows liberally (and incompetently) from The Omen.  This movie shouldn't be confused with Darren Lynn Bousman's similarly titled 11-11-11 which takes place in Spain and wasn't fortunate enough to get a release before it's apocalyptic title date.",1328140800,,1144,4.963350785340314
4854379,2,B005OQNOWG,"This isn't quite ""so bad it's good,"" but it is good for quite a few laughs.  I wanted to give it more stars as a comedy but then everyone would yell at me for raising the overall rating for the wrong reasons.  Almost reaches ""Troll 2"" level of bad but not quite.  It might have been better if they had shot for that goal, then they could at least attain cult status.  I don't resent watching it since it was on Netflix Watch Instantly, so essentially no money wasted, only time.  I think someone should nominate this for Rifftrax to cover.",1328054400,,539,4.297029702970297
4854380,1,B005OQNOWG,"This movie was just plain awful!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The story was lame as hell, the little boy is the devil so he has to be killed before 11/11/2011 or else the devil will take over his body and destroy our world.  The little old lady is constantly trying to kill him in really lame ways.  Why not just go out, buy a shotgun at Wal-Mart or Dicks and blow his face off?

On top of that everyone in town is a devil worshiper and they can't wait for 11/11/2011 so they can have their new lord and savior Satan take over the world.

So let's fast forward to the end of the movie.  The father kills the little old lady with a machete and he brings the kid inside.  Then the mom kills her nurse upstairs and she is shrieking bloody murder.  Yet the dad doesn't hear it.  Why?  Plus the police and paramedics are sent to this house 3 times in one night, they show up and leave in like 5 minutes.  Usually the police stick around a little longer than that when a person is accused of assaulting a child.

Then when the father realizes he has to kill the little boy, he goes from loving father refusing to let harm come to his child, to realizing that he must slaughter him in cold blood in like 5 seconds.  He sure came to terms with that pretty quick!  Also when the kid is killed instantly everything is back to normal.  The devil worshipers are gone, and the cop that died is back alive again.  So, did the people that died earlier come back to life too?  Never any explanation given for any of it.

8481706,3,B005OQNOWG,"Before getting into my review of ""11/11/11"" just let me say that I did not know that there was a movie released the same year titled ""11-11-11"" until I looked ""11/11/11"" up on IMDb. I therefore did not start watching this movie thinking I was watching a different movie like many of the reviewers who gave this movie one star here. I was looking for and expecting this movie.

11/11/11 is OK, but just barely. A satanic cult has gone to great lengths to get this family (with the boy who will turn 11 on 11/11/11) into just the right house a few days before 11/11/11. The movie's lack of suspense and horror was not due to lack of trying, it is full of bloody and gory murders and the significance of the boy turning 11 on 11/11/11 is hinted at all throughout the movie.

But somehow the plot never really comes together right, the special effects for the murders leave a lot to be desired, and the hints on the significance of 11/11/11 maybe a little too strong. Also the ending is a bit confusing.

This movie has a lot in common with the old horror movies from the 50's and 60's, if you like them just consider this one of those old movie which was made a half century late.",1426291200,,1177,4.292792792792793
8481707,1,B005OQNOWG,"11/11/11 (Keith Allan, 2011)

It's bad enough when The Asylum is doing mockbusters of Darren Lynn Bousman movies; I believe this may be the first time I actually went into an Asylum mockbuster fully expecting it to be better than the original. But here's the kicker: 11/11/11, as horrendous as it is, is actually not the worst movie I watched on the day I watched it. (Don't Look in the Cellar claims that title.) Trust me, avoiding this stinker is your best option, but in case you need details, read on.

Plot: Jack (Midnight Movie's Jon Briddell) and Melissa (Shark Week's Erin Coker in her feature debut) have a son named Nat (Parenthood's Hayden Byerly). For a while, Nat seems like a normal kid, but after the family moves into a new house, his behavior becomes increasingly bizarre. He's not the only one, though; their new neighbors seem to be aligning into factions around Nat, one supporting him, the other denouncing him as the antichrist. Is he? And if so, can Jack and Melissa bring themselves to do the unthinkablesacrifice their son before he destroys the world?

There is a difference, however fine the line, between writing something that's kind of unoriginal, but still brings a new angle or what have you, and simply ripping off whatever you see around you that has any relevance. The Asylum have made a very profitable trade from the latter approach in the last half-decade or so, but as we get farther and farther into their existence, it seems like they've just stopped even trying to have their movies make sense. Compare this to one of their first handful of mockbusters; there's still some plot here, but it's not even close to being as coherent as, say, Halloween Night. It's a string of scenes lifted from other, better movies with the occasional semi-original scene thrown in (I get the feeling, though I've no proof of this, those were the scenes that popped into the heads of whatever screenwriter wrote whatever mockbuster you happen to be perusing at the time, and everything else just got stitched together around them. In this case, it's the big climactic showdown in the garage, which is pretty much the only thing about this movie worth watching). In the benefit of hindsight, well, I watched Asylum's newest-as-of-this-writing mockbuster yesterday, and they've continued on down that road, so this one is, in retrospect, not quite as horrible. Which is not to say it isn't still horrible. If you decide to take the plunge with this one, just know what you're getting yourself into, and know that it's awful.

The plot to the film is very interesting, and the film leaves you on the edge of your seat every second, making you wonder what's going to happen next. Of course this film isn't a Hollywood masterpiece, it is low budget. But very well done for the budget it had. A lot of effort was put into this film, you can tell.
