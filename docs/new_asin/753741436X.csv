1115406,3,753741436X,"I purchased this for my 2 year old daughter to help her learn her colors and while she likes it (she likes EVERYTHING with Elmo), it isn't her favorite.  If I had it to do over again, I probably would have skipped it.  The program is a little strange in that it is a game-show format and they created the host to be just as annoying as they are in real life.  Not so enjoyable to watch and I find my daughter just isn't into it.  Maybe she will be later.",1202428800,,454,3.956043956043956
1115407,5,753741436X,"I love this dvd and so does my 22 month old son....he always comes to me and asks to put""shapes"" on and then watches the whole thing",1185062400,2,132,3.925925925925926
1115408,5,753741436X,"First, I must say that I hate to see negative reviews for this product!  My son is almost 2 and absolutely loves this DVD.  Before Grandma bought this, we had been reading a few books on shapes and my son was catching on pretty quickly.  I think that this program is helping to reinforce his newly acquired knowledge--he is recognizing circles, squares, triangles and ovals in everyday objects like plates, tiles, etc.

I have to admit that the muppet gameshow host featured here is a little annoying, but so are the human ones at one time or another!  I think that he adds to the fun of the show.  Also parents, we need to remember that DVDs such as these are not really for our entertainment and try to watch through the eyes of our little sponges.

I recommend this to kids who are hungry to learn and have parents that are excited to help.",1179446400,10,843,4.4
1115409,1,753741436X,"...and I am fine with that! This is terribly annoying. The announcer is loud and frantic. Not entertaining. In fact, it is so chaotic that my daughter gets uncomfortable and leaves the room. This is the child who comes running when she hears the beginning of Elmo's World. Running. This film has her running in the opposite direction. I'd skip it. I'm selling mine on ebay soon...real cheap...",1176336000,11,393,4.794117647058823
1115410,5,753741436X,"My 2-year-old loves this DVD.  She knows her colors pretty well, but she didn't know her shapes until after watching this video.  It's the only one she has wanted to watch for 2 weeks now.  It basically has a series of ""gameshows"" that Elmo and Zoe play to find squares and healthy foods in different colors.  Worth buying!",1159488000,3,323,4.517241379310345
1115411,4,753741436X,"My 20 month old daughter LOVES this video, which features Elmo and Zoe.  Yes, the game show announcer is a little annoying with his ""Harry Carey"" imitation, but overall, it's a great video.  My daughter enjoys it very much and the format is easy for her to follow.",1155254400,5,264,4.479166666666667
1115412,1,753741436X,"I am a try-before-you-buy kind of mom when it comes to DVDs, so I rented this DVD from Netflix with hopes that my 18-month-old daughter would love this new Sesame Street offering as she loves all things Elmo.  She hated it!  We didn't even get halfway through it.

It is set up in a game show format and the ""host"" of the show is really loud and obnoxious and has a kind of scary toothy grin at one point and a big scary square head.  Every time he came on the screen as the emcee of this game show that Elmo and Zoe are playing, my daughter started to cry and turned away from the show.

The older Elmo DVDs have all been a big hit in our house, but the newer ones like the Sesame Beginnings series, which are REALLY boring, even for smaller babies and this one in particular, are really jumbled.  This one jumps from shapes to colors to healthy food groups???  What the?!?

Anyway, rent this if you must, but don't waste your money on buying it.  There are much better Elmo videos out there.",1150243200,36,993,4.211640211640212

Maybe a 4yr old would like it? I still wouldn't hesitate to try more DVDs from sesame st. I just didn't like the game show host vibe this one had...in my opinion, It's not conducive to toddlers learning social skills.

1115528,3,753741436X,"I've never found Elmo-centric shows to be the easiest for adults to sit through but I was looking at this more in terms of how it might help a little one develop an ear for Mandarin:

-  Only the DVD menus and optional subtitles are in simplified characters and there are no words taught on screen.
-  The Beijing accent isn't particularly exaggerated, which is good for kids whose families might come from mandarin-speaking countries other than China. (Learning Mandarin isn't as useful if you can't understand one's extended family). In fact if anything, some the characters, including the annoying game show host, could use better enunciation.
-  One can always switch back and forth to the original English track if they want to change the language focus.

Do make sure your DVD player is region or code free before purchasing.

Overall, I've seen better Sesame Street material out there but I like that it offers more substantial, practical Mandarin teaching than some of the bilingual alternatives out in the US market. Plus it is markedly easier for adults to sit through than say some of the Elmo's World shows.",1287014400,2,1119,4.863157894736842
