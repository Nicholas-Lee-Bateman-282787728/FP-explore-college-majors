5715564,5,B00CCWGDDW,"Great good ol shark movie, when shark movies were shark movies.  Great effects for the time, acting was decent, plot was pretty good and the suspence is well done.  Over all I would recommend it to fans of classic horror films and jaws.",1382572800,4,236,4.465116279069767

 Actually the managed to rip off elements from several Jaws movies...",1523404800,,98,4.764705882352941
8580342,3,B00CCWGDDW,"Jaws is technically a dumb movie but if you ever were hoping there was a knock off version made even crazier then The Last Shark is totally for you. The main plot involves a giant great white shark that eats people and the men that go to hunt it down. So basically, it's Jaws but it's even goofier because there's more gore, more slow mo Sam Peckinpah style action sequences, and a lot more ladies in white thin material outfits falling into the water. It's hilarious in it's own way and the director Enzo G Castelarri knows it and plays into it. Enzo is/was a long time director in Italy and took on every kind of job you can think of from legit attempts at good movies like Keoma to stuff like this. He's a good hand at both. Unlike many directors, he's a guy who has a sense humor. So, he gives you plenty of humorous moments that are pretty tongue in cheek. It gets really tongue in cheek too. If you want to see a shark pull a helicopter out of the sky, this is the movie for you.

It's not a great movie but it's fun. Don't expect great art or anything basically. You'll have fun if you know what you're going in for.",1516147200,,1123,4.175115207373272
8580343,1,B00CCWGDDW,How this got 4 stars is ridiculous.  Old boring 70s movie with such fake shark scenes and tons of bad beach music.  Hated it!,1514419200,,125,4.166666666666667
8580344,5,B00CCWGDDW,"THE LAST SHARK (aka: GREAT WHITE- 1981) commences w/ an opening song, sounding much like a cat screeching, accompanied by a baboon, banging on oil drums. This, while a man windsurfs in sssllowww-mmotionnn. Oh no! A huge denizen of the deep is just beneath surfer dude's feet! EEE-GGAAAHHGH! CHOMP! GLUB! Meanwhile, on land, Peter Benton (James Franciscus- BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE CAT O' NINE TAILS), who IS NOT a sheriff, is looking very Brody-like in his sea-side abode. Simultaneously, Ron Hamer (Vic Morrow- HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE), who IS a boat captain, is looking somewhat Quint-esque. Brod... er, I mean Benton and Hamer are investigating the surf boarder's disappearance. Oh my goodness!  There's a surfing regatta scheduled for the coming Saturday! Not surprisingly, there's a craven, do-nothing mayor who feels that the regatta must go on. A meeting is held, where Benton dazzles the audience w/ shark slides, and Hamer emotes like a TV preacher, speaking some kind of Germanic / Gaelic pidgin language. The regatta gets underway, while Donna Summer's sister's cousin's hair-dresser warbles a disco ditty, and a lovely bikini'd lass runs toward the ocean- IN! SLLOWW!! MMOTIONNN!!! This s NOT Amity island, so don't expect any Peter Benchly cameos! Do expect the most boring water race since those sailboats in TENTACLES! Thankfully, the not-JAWS shows up to eat the contestants, while Hamer babbles in his Russian / Hebrew / Bostonian sub-dialect, and a man in a boat flies up in the air like a mannequin w/ a jet-pack! Arr! These be good times my friends! A group of imbeciles sets out to kill the shark, which as we've found out, is actually a monstrous, bobbling whale turd w/ teeth. At other times, during some underwater shots, it's a wobbly, rubber torpedo. SPECIAL NOTE: To those who thought the shark in JAWS looked ""fake"". Watch this movie and repent! Do not miss the fishing-by-helicopter sequence! It could be the single, most profound example of schlock ever filmed! It's THAT amazing! Soooo, Benton and Hamer finally go out to sea to annihilate not-JAWS. This gives Hamer a great opportunity to wax eloquent in his Estonian / Esperanto gibberish! A cowboy shows up, who is NOT Clint Eastwood, and he's got a ""special"" gun. He's no match for the finny fiend, ushering in the final, most endearingly awful portion of the movie! Yes, this is bottom-of-the-barrel cinema at its best! Drop everything and run to your TV, to watch this spectacle beyond description! Right now!! NOWWW!...",1508716800,2,2544,5.01418439716312

8580346,2,B00CCWGDDW,"Aside from underwater bathtub special effects featuring a clay shark and a few people getting bitten in half, this 1981 Jaws rip-off is a rather boring affair.",1478563200,,159,4.925925925925926
8580347,1,B00CCWGDDW,"Don't get suckered by that cover pic.  This is like watching jacque coustea reruns from the 70s, definitely found footage and james fransiscus pops up every 20 mins or so.",1476489600,,171,4.7
8580348,5,B00CCWGDDW,I actually like this movie! Thanks,1473638400,,34,4.833333333333333
8580349,4,B00CCWGDDW,"This was originally called Great White, and was pulled from theatres when Universal threatened to sue, calling it a Jaws ripoff. Of course, it is an Italian Jaws ripoff, but it's a fun mixture of camp and suspense, with a pretty effective mechanical shark, and a better helicopter scene than Jaws 2. Check it out!",1470873600,,313,4.709090909090909
