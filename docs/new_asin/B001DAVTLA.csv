8292635,5,B001DAVTLA,"A bizarre and charming adaptation of Deerhoof's album ""Milk Man"". I heard about this DVD in a review of the new Deerhoof album and couldn't believe somebody would adapt a Deerhoof album into a children's ballet. I immediately purchased the DVD and was surprised but not disappointed when I saw the final product.

A note to anyone thinking of purchasing this DVD: this is an amateur production featuring small children. The backing band is made up of members of the community where this was produced and isn't perfect. Singing is often off key, certain players are out of tune, the quality is better than expected but still not amazing. The kids are also too young for any complex choreography to be used. Their performance mostly consists of running, jumping, or lying down on stage in specific patterns to the songs. There are also some pleasant production surprises featuring balloons and pingpong balls.

This isn't something I'd probably watch a 2nd time but was an incredibly enjoyable watch for me and my friends. It was great to see the amount of dedication and creativity that went into producing and choreographing this. The kids are also adorable and look like they had a great time performing. This whole concept is so novel that I would recommend this for any Deerhoof fans, especially if you enjoy Milk Man in particular. A very interesting and charming watch.",1454889600,,1374,4.8927038626609445
