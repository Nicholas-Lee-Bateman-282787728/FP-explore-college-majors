2691890,5,B000KJTFCU,"I found the sizzling salsa DVD exercise video to be excellent.  I exercise regularly, including  walking, spinning, cycling, body pump, etc.  But like everyone else I get too busy sometimes and can't get to the gym.  I like exercise  videos and actually use them.  I have been taking body jam classes at the gym, which are not easy, and can really appreciate the sizzling salsa dance steps.  Stella is very clear in her instructions and she makes it easy to follow the steps.  The choreography is outstanding and the exercise group maintains perfect tempo.  Please note the steps are difficult but Stella and her class make the movements look and flow easily.  With practice I was able to follow the steps and keep up with the class.  For such a good exercise video the background music is lacking.  In Stella's next salsa video I would recommend better tunes!",1175212800,,860,4.736486486486487
2691891,2,B000KJTFCU,"I took ballroom dance lessons last year and I found the latin dances to be my favorite. I thought if Salsa which I loved the most is incorporated into exercise, it would be perfect! But when I started the DVD, I was very disappointed. The music was annoying and the steps were very simple, repetitive and boring. For me, dancing salsa with salsa music would be the best exercise and more enjoyable.",1173744000,20,398,4.541666666666667
2691892,5,B000KJTFCU,"As it even says on the back cover ""This fat burning fiesta is hot, hot, hot and it's super effective."" .  I tend to agree.  It's fun to do and the instructor, Stella Sandoval, is motivating and encouraging.  The music is also motivating and before you know it the workout is done because you were having so much fun with it, you didn't realise that you were working out.

There is lots of variety with the movements so you won't get bored.  She teaches you the moves in such a way that is easy to learn because you learn a foot pattern and after adding arms or your hips you do the entire sequence.  While there are the mambos and samba's, there is things like back step salsa's and tango mambo.  You are on the go almost the entire time and the energy is high.  The set is simple yet nice and all the other exercisers are colorful and fun to watch.  I like how at the end there is a dance tutorial.  It makes it more helpful if you didn't pick it up during the workout.

Overall, I'd recommend this to people already semi fit.  It helps to have done some dance before, and an enjoyment of latin music and dance is a must.  I like to do this once or twice a week along with a more cardio challenging workout, but this is a great fill in for a change of pace from your normal routine.  I really like it.",1173571200,5,1302,4.115079365079365
2691893,2,B000KJTFCU,"This video was a great disappointment to me.  I no the latin dances and I was really hoping for an exercise routine that incorporated those dances into the workout.  After all that is how it is promoted.  With the exception of the cha cha move being slightly like the dance there are no real dance moves here.  If you are expecting to see the Mambo, Merengue,Samba, and Tango moves they promise you will be disappointed.  They are not there.  Each move is just a slight variation of the next. In my opinion it is not at all what they claim it is, and it isn't a very good work out.  I was very disappointed.",1173052800,12,607,4.271929824561403
2691894,5,B000KJTFCU,"I think this workout is great.  I always work up a sweat when I do it.  The steps are relatively easy, and there is a section that teaches you the steps.  Its easy to learn this video and it starts out light goes to moderate than a little heavier and then cool down.  I think it is a great workout.",1172620800,8,298,3.9166666666666665
2691895,3,B000KJTFCU,"I've just started using exercise videos as a form of working out at home. I love to dance and this is one of the videos I picked up. The video is fun, but if you're looking for something to really get you moving, this isn't for you. This will be one of the videos I save for when I want a lighter workout. But nonetheless, it is fun and the moves are great. You just need to pep yourself up a little to get a sweat going.",1172448000,5,421,3.8505747126436782
2691896,4,B000KJTFCU,"As you can read in the other reviews there is a lot of versatility and fun to this DVD.  While it's a work out that feels like you're learning to dance (and believe me.. it's a workout!) I found that I couldn't keep up with the steps at times although I had previewed them first.  I wish there could have been a little more explanation as to how the steps were going to go together.  That said, I intend to keep using this DVD because of it's great energy.  I'll eventually figure out where my feet go and how my arms are supposed to move.

I definitely recommend it especially to those who don't want another boring step left, step right dvd.",1170201600,,643,4.237704918032787
2691897,4,B000KJTFCU,"Sizzling Salsa is one of the latest offerings from the Dance Off the Inches series, which has produced fun, generally easy-to-follow dance workouts.  This one is led by Stella Sandoval, and as in the other DVDs, she teaches a class of four in what almost looks to be someone's living room.  This time, two of the background exercisers are other instructors, Michelle Dozios and Marie Forleo.

This DVD has a particularly nice feature called the Step Guide.  This is a 17-minute segment in which Stella breaks down some of the dance steps from the workout, first showing the move, then performing it slowly, and finally, bringing it up to tempo.  Even though I've done some Latin dance workouts before, I found it very helpful to review this section before attempting the main program.  However, keep in mind that Stella does not teach every step from the workout here and also that some of the steps are performed a bit differently once they appear in the workout.

The workout itself consists of a 5 minute warm-up, 3 dance routines (Spicy Salsa, Latin Lime Twist, and Mucho Mambo Combo), and a 2.5 minute cool-down.  Each dance routine is approximately 9 minutes long.  Stella teaches in an add-on style, showing you a couple of moves at time, having you practice these, and then gradually adding more moves to the mix until you have worked your way up to the full routine.  One you have learned all of the moves in the routine, Stella ""takes you to the dance floor"" (her way of saying that you complete the entire dance) four times total.  Each of the three dance segments is stand-alone (ie, the Mucho Mambo Combo doesn't repeat any of the moves from Spicy Salsa), and the DVD is nicely chaptered so that you could mix-and-match if you chose to do so.

I would rate the choreography of this video as moderate:  those who enjoy complex choreo might find this a bit on the easy side, whereas those who prefer very simple cardio might get lost a few times here.  I tend to be on the latter side, and while I was generally able to follow along my first time through, I did have to really concentrate.  I'd say the intensity level is about low moderate as well:  the workout did get my heart rate up into my target zone, although it dipped below during some of the teaching/other inbetween moments.  I clocked the workout in at just under 37 minutes.

Overall, I found this to be a nice dance routine that was enjoyable, moderately complex, and seemed to have a real Latin dance feel to it.  It would probably be suited to advanced beginners to intermediate exercisers who enjoy fun dance steps and easily able to pick up moderately choreographed combinations.",1168732800,91,2659,4.6431623931623935
2691898,4,B000KJTFCU,"This is another workout in the Dance off the Inches series, led by Stella Sandoval who I haven't seen in another video.  She is joined by 4 other ladies including Michelle Dozois and Marie Forleo, who are leads in other Dance off the Inches workouts.  They are in a comfortable living room setting all ready to dance to some fun and spicy latin moves.

One of the features on this DVD is a step guide which teaches many of the moves that make up the foundation of the dance routines.  I found this very helpful, some dance workouts look easy but once you attempt them it's not the case so this came in handy.  Each step is demonstrated slowly, then faster, then arm movements are added, then any other variations that might take place in the workout.

There are 3 dance routines plus a warmup and cooldown, the first dance routine is called Spicy Salsa.  The steps seen here are the salsa, cha chas, merengue, hip rolls and walking cha chas.  Stella will lead you through each step, repeating each one a few times then adding one step at a time. As the steps are added you will take the routine from the top which might be repetitive for some but it didn't bother me.

The next dance routine is called Latin Lime Twist.  Here you will see the latin twist, box step, sambas, mambos, shimmeys, stomps plus some interesting arm movements such as flamenco and ole arms.  The final dance segment is called Mucho Mambo Combo, which is mainly a mambo and a tango.  Some additional steps are mixed in though such as tap hops, cha chas, and salsa steps.

I liked this workout a lot, thought it was fun and Stella does a good job leading this video. She is enthusiastic and seems to be enjoying herself.  I thought that she and all the backgrounders did a nice job with the moves too. The moves aren't too terribly hard, though it might take a few tries to get them down, but there is the handy step guide if you need to review them.  I think I will be using that feature of the DVD a lot.  The music was decent, I thought it fit the workout well, though it was on the softer side.  Overall I give this workout 4 and a half stars.",1163894400,39,2120,4.313131313131313

2691901,2,B000KJTFCU,"This workout keeps you moving from beginning to end. I've used other ""Dance Off The Inches"" videos before buying Sizzling Salsa however, this workout fails to provide an adequate cool down at the end. The step guides are helpful & Stella Sandoval is a good instructor who is upbeat and knows how to cue upcoming moves. It's a good cardio workout but the lack of any stretches as well as a very short & fast moving cool down,which consists of only hip swings, have me searching elsewhere for other workout videos that are more complete. It's almost as if they ran out of time to add a longer routine. Disappointing....I have since sold this video to a used bookstore and started using Leslie Sansone workouts. There is no comparison, really. Leslie rocks!!",1426636800,3,755,4.7272727272727275

2691904,5,B000KJTFCU,"For any dance beginner, and at any weight or age group I would highly recommend this DVD over the Salsa video from Crunch (which I just hated and wish I could return it). What I love about Stella Sandoval is that she goes over the dance steps in an easy to follow method and at a slow to medium learning pace. She teaches you step by step the moves you need to do the dance workout. This is perfect for anyone who is looking to learn a bit of salsa, merenge, and other latin dance steps while getting a great cardio workout and it's so fun! I HATE the gym. I couldn't be happier with this video and I hope Miss Sandoval has more videos in her collection for when I'm at a more advanced level. I can't say enough good things about her teaching style and the video overall.",1422316800,4,771,4.1466666666666665

2691911,2,B000KJTFCU,It is very slow moving. I didn't sweat at all. The music is good and instructor does a good job but too basic for me. I stopped it 40 minutes in as I was bored,1396656000,,159,3.5714285714285716
2691912,2,B000KJTFCU,"I own several other Dance off the Inches workout videos and have been pleased with them.  But, this one I found to be mediocre.  First, most of the music isn't that great.  Also, the moves are very basic, which I guess is good if you're looking for something easy, but the move are so uncreative that I find them boring.  Lastly, this video barely makes me break a sweat (and I'm not in the best of shape).  But, I guess I'll keep it when I want a shorter, easier workout.",1395532800,,472,4.2

2691914,4,B000KJTFCU,"This Sizzling Salsa dvd I'd say is beginner/intermediate level.  It's much faster paced than the Jane Fonda dance videos, but a lot less intense than a zumba class I'd say.  Im not very in shape but I've been working out with dvds for a while, and I broke a sweat but didn't have trouble keeping up.  It and other dvds in the series come with a step guide, that I assume breaks things down step by step slowly.  I think its awesome that that is automatically included, and also awesome its a separate track and they don't slow down the main workout with a lot of teaching.

I get impatient with breakdowns though and have already had a lot of zumba so I decided to just go right to the workout, and it was just fine, no problem following it.  There were a couple steps that took me a time or two but generally it was quite doable and the cuing is quite good.  The dvd is just one workout, about 30 minutes I think (plus the step guide as a separate track), including a short warm up and cool down but it went by pretty fast.  There aren't separate tracks  (like zumba dvds) but there do seem to be sets of steps that you add to till you have a routine, do it for a while, then build up to another one, maybe 4 sets of steps on here.  The instructor is pleasant and encouraging but not overly perky or irritating, which makes a huge difference to me and how often I'll use the dvd. I'll definitely do this one again.

Oh..if you have really bad knees, you might have to be careful, and you probably also want shoes that are more slidey than sticky, similar to what you might want for zumba.",1392595200,,1589,4.194078947368421

2691934,5,B000KJTFCU,"This DVD is great if you are looking for a fun way to start burning calories.  I purchased this years ago but really started using it last year.  I thought the moves were a little complicated for a beginner, but you catch on the more you do it.  I think that is what helps to motivate you to try again.  It is not a dance instructional video as some thought (although I can't imagine why given the Dance Off series).  I believe it is worth the money.  The moves are a little sexy but nothing that would make you feel embarrassed - always fun.  I felt comfortable using it with coworkers at the company gym.  As a relatively new ex-couch potato, I do work up a sweat on just the first dance set.  Even after going to Zumba several times, I still feel like this was worthwhile to have at home.  So if you are like me, looking for something inexpensive, fun, and effective to start working out, this is perfect.  If you are advanced, looking for dance moves that you can take to the club, or just generally grumpy like some reviewers, well this isn't want you are looking for. :-)",1327190400,2,1077,4.282178217821782

Some people have said that they don't even break a sweatwhen they do this so I have come to the conclusion that they must be Olympic athletes.  I have three of Stellas dvds and find that they are all great.  At 45 I still wear a size 3 in clothing and I think the constant use of these dvds has kept the middle age weight off!

2691938,2,B000KJTFCU,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be a fun workout, different from what I normally do. However, I got bored doing this dvd. The main motion is swaying your hips. You pretty much do this the whole time while sometimes moving side to side and alternating leg movements. There isn't much varaition to the arm movements at all either. I felt all I was doing was stepping into place with a little extra hip movement.

The steps weren't terribly hard to follow, and the energy of the instructor is good. It's about a 35 minute workout total, and there is also a tutorial about 15 minutes long that goes over the steps. I did the tutorial before starting, although I think you could jump right into the workout and still be okay.

2691942,4,B000KJTFCU,"This workout is really fun.  I was always intimidated at Salsa clubs, but I felt like I got a taste of how much fun it'd be to take real lessons with this DVD.  It's pretty easy to follow and if you do it with a little bounce, like the ladies in the video, then you'll definitely get your heart rate up.  Obviously it's not a literal interpretation of a dance you'd do at a club, so if you're looking for that it's not this video.  However, the twisting moves will work out your obliques and everything else will work out your calves.  I want to try out some of the other ""Dance off.."" DVDs as well. Hope you all enjoy!",1251072000,,619,4.125
2691943,3,B000KJTFCU,"I was looking for a more upbeat ""sizzling"" salsa video to lose inches (and some weight), but this one fell short. I liked the ambiance and Sandoval's instructions, but am not so sure I'll loose many inches with the watered down Latino beats. I think this program is good for anyone interested in learning extremely basic (did I say ""extremely basic""?) Latino dance steps. I'm a bit disappointed.",1244592000,,395,4.823529411764706

2691946,4,B000KJTFCU,I'm trying to work in some different things into my exercise and have tried a couple types of dance workouts.  I love latin music so this one sounded good.  I found this DVD to be alright.  I'm a true dance beginner and found this doable but at times a bit too fast and requiring more coordination then I seem to have.  I'll try it a couple more times before deciding whether to put it in regular rotation or not.,1223424000,,413,4.189873417721519
2691947,1,B000KJTFCU,"I've had a couple of salsa lessons, and even with that, I found this hard to follow.  Her cueing is very poor, so you can't follow her instructions.  And to make matters worse, quite often the camera doesn't show the participants' feet so it's very hard to figure out what they're doing by watching.

I would steer very, very, very clear of this one if you have knee problems, too.  There's a lot of twisting your legs from side-to-side that I found very painful.",1222646400,9,463,4.476190476190476

2691949,1,B000KJTFCU,"Colorful aesthetics, moderately fun and challenging steps. HOWEVER, the video is shot for watching NOT for participating. The timing fluctuates between cha cha, merengue and salsa without notice. Familiarity with each dance does not make it much easier to be successful following the format. Steps are often NOT to the beat. If you like being on beat and in sync with others...this is not the video for you.",1204502400,7,407,5.0

2691951,5,B000KJTFCU,"This is a fun workout.  I highly recommend practicing the steps prior to the workout; it really helps to understand what to do with your feet & hips.  The instructor step guide is easy to follow---so watch it first.  The music is not so great, but it is fun to watch the dancers & try to copy their sexy moves. The workout becomes more fun as you become more comfortable with the steps & add your own Salsa style!",1194998400,2,413,4.2025316455696204

Aerobic exercise is something that I am learning to like and it's videos like these that help me like this thing that is becoming necessary in my life more.  While some of the transitions are not the smoothest, this video is actually fairly easy; it gives you a great workout and teaches you some steps you could actually use at a Salsa Night or when you go out to the Club!  I use it often and just know you will too!",1189641600,,461,4.157303370786517
2691953,1,B000KJTFCU,"I agree thoroughly with Kate and Donna!  I wish I'd seen their reviews before ordering this.  After an evening of salsa or merengue dancing, I have often thought what a great workout it was, so when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect.  I was so wrong!  On the plus side, she's definitely enthusiastic.  However, this is really aerobics with a hint of Latin dance steps (or Latin steps the way an aerobics instructor would do them) set to Latin elevator music. I've TRIED to do this twice now with the hope that it wasn't as bad as I'd originally thought, but I had to stop and write this review.  Here's what's going on while I type: ""Let's go into the Mambo move.  Now let's add the Ole arms. Tap it out.  Go back to your Ole arms.... box step, mambo ole, tap it out, ...flamenco arms, samba, mambo ole... tap and then hop...""  Boy, it would be interesting to picture them doing this at a dance club.

When I searched for ""dance"" I got this.  I think that if I'd searched for ""aerobics"" I wouldn't have been as completely disappointed.",1184716800,37,1043,4.352331606217617
2691954,2,B000KJTFCU,"Perhaps the title should be changed. This is by no means a pure salsa workout. It is rather a mix of latin moves (some salsa, merengue, cha cha cha, even samba). I find it a joke that it doesn't even feature latin music. There are countless great salsa tunes that would have made this workout much more fun.

And for the workout, you can hardly break a sweat! You follow the instructor in a succession of movements, with little aerobic exertion. I would only recommend it for people who are absolute beginners or for people who are very deconditioned or uncoordinated. Otherwise the workout is boring, unexciting and a waste of time & money.

However, if you like latin moves and are looking for a fun workout which will not only burn calories, but also improve your coordination while teaching you some fun moves, I highly recommend the Kukuwa dance workout. It is one of the best afro-latin based workouts in the market and the instructor is a blast.

Have fun!  Diviertanse bailando al compas de la mejor musica del mundo!",1182038400,10,1025,4.6464088397790055

2691956,3,B000KJTFCU,"I like Stella as an instructor, but this workout didn't have the same pizazz as the workouts led by Michelle Dozois and Maria Forleo.  I agree with the other reviewer who found the moves repetitive.  I also agree that this workout won't get you sweating.  It's a good workout for a lighter day, or to pair up with another half hour DVD.  As far as workouts go it is safe, will get you moving, and provides proper instruction, but it lacked the wow factor (for me, anyway).",1177545600,16,472,4.390804597701149
2691957,5,B000KJTFCU,"This 38-minute salsa workout features genuine latin dance moves that are put cleverly into three sections to create a great cardio dance workout!  The three sections are ""Spicy Salsa"", ""Latin Lime Twist"", and ""Mucho Mambo Combo.""  There is also a warm-up and cool down that are both fairly good.

Stella Sandoval is a great teacher, not annoying at all, and constantly throwing out fun encouraging comments and reminding you of what is coming next.  And if you can't follow the steps just by watching the workout, there's the very helpful Step Guide in which she breaks down every one of the steps for you.  If you're a non-dancer or just like to be more prepared, it's really helpful to watch this before attempting the workout.  However, the first time I didn't want to bother watching this first, and I was able to follow them about 90% of the time.  The second time I decided to go through the Step Guide and it really helped with moves such as the tango step.

Overall, this is a great workout.  My favorite parts are the ""Spicy Salsa"" and ""Latin Lime Twist"", but I feel like I burn most of my calories in the ""Mucho Mambo Combo"" so I don't dislike that part.  It may be a bit too easy for the very advanced, but for beginner to intermediate, ESPECIALLY those who love to dance, you'll find this something you actually look forward to each day.",1176595200,13,1349,4.537190082644628
