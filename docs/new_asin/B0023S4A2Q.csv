3841982,3,B0023S4A2Q,"Anime has a lot of cliches, and mecha anime has even more than its fair share. Especially if you include, you know, metaphysical stuff along with the giant killer robots. ""Aquarion"" seems to have all those cliches and more, but Shoji Kawamori's series starts hitting its stride after five or six episodes -- pomposity is replaced with a sly sense of humor, peppered with some decent characters and a bittersweet edge.

12,000 years ago, the Earth was invaded by the arrogant Shadow Angels, and were defeated by the Shadow Angel Apollonius (also called Solar Wing) and his human lover Celiane, in the enormous three-part mecha Aquarion. Now the Shadow Angels have returned. Then two element users -- including Celiane's reincarnation, spoiled princess Silvia -- come across a strange, feral street boy named Apollo. Not only is Apollo shockingly powerful, but he pilots the Aquarion as he always knew how.

Silvia is appalled by the idea that her long-lost soulmate is this rough, dirty boy, and Apollo is only coming along to rescue his abducted friend. And as they battle the Shadow Angels, this motley little team of element users learns some extremely weird lessons -- the benefits of fighting barefoot, cosplaying, addiction, diets, dreams, vampires, jealousy, their ""first times,"" finding Apollo in a booby-trapped labyrinth.

But then a familiar face returns -- Apollonius' ex-lover Touma, who still feels betrayed by Solar Wing jilting him for Celiane 12,000 years ago (sheesh, get OVER it). And as the climactic battle against the Shadow Angels approaches and the Tree of Life gains power, one of their own will turn against them... but what does fate have in store?

The first several episodes of ""Aquarion"" are not very engaging -- they speed by too fast, don't really make you care about the characters, and basically consist of the same pattern: Apollo does something feral and/or stupid during training, Silvia and/or Sirius are disgusted, the Cherubim attack, but Our Heroes (including Apollo) save the day and learn a valuable lesson in the process. Also typical anime cliches (accidental kiss, Benedict-and-Beatrice soulmates, and big strompy robots).

But after the first five or six episodes, something happens -- the series gains a sense of humor that infuses its rather cheesy overarcing storyline. Kawamori lets the story unfold gradually, and with a sly sense of spoofery and occasional bittersweet moments. Silly attack names (""Unlucky Bottom Attack!""), comical deus ex machinae (Our Heroes are saved by a cry of ""DINNER!""), piroetting mecha, pseudomystical stuff, cosplay, and a Yoda-like commander who exists solely to teach the heroes Important Life Lessons at the worst times. And I must admit, those orgasmic mecha merges are pretty funny.

The biggest problem: the last four or five episodes are... well, while it's a fairly impressive ending with interesting twists, it doesn't make much sense. There are just too many holes left open, apparently for the sake of Big Tragic Uplifting Finale.

The characters are something of a mixed bag, though. Kawamori spends too much time emphasizing that Apollo is a feral wild-card, so we don't get to see enough of his loyalty and kindness, while Silvia is pretty much a brat to everyone, except the brother she has a bizarre incestuous crush on. The supporting characters end up being much more interesting, partly because they seem so much more real -- loyal, flirty athlete Pierre, the painfully unlucky Reika, and a handful of newbies who are still learning the ropes. And there's Silvia's brother Sirius, whose confidence and self-image are being slowly destroyed by Apollo's presence.

""Aquarion"" takes a long, long time to get off the ground. But once the satire kicks in, this mecha series becomes a gorgeously animated, fluffy brand of brain-candy. Too bad about the ending.",1261008000,12,3853,5.1536
3841983,5,B0023S4A2Q,"I have never written a review for anything and i have spent thousans of dollars on items on Amazon. But this series compelled me to write a review.

Now I don't consider myself to be a hardcore Anime Lover becasue i don't watch any in the original Japanese Language. I actually like the English Dubs, but I am very picky about what anime i watch or buy because it gets expensive. I wouldn't sit and watch any piece of crap!

Now this series is Great because I think that is revolutionay as far as the animation goes. The CGI doesn't take away from the fact it is a cartoon. I don't like watching all computer generated characters. So the the characters always look crisp.

The series story line is also intricate! it starts off deep! I usually can tell what is going to happen or how they will defeat the enemy, but not on this Series. The back story is also a mystery in the beginning. At first i didn't like that because i ""like to know why!"" but it made the story so much better when the story starts to unfold in the middle of the series.

I can't leave out the fighting! man the fights was alsome. You will never see any anime with Gundam like robots that have the fighting power or the mobility of these on the Aquarion Series. The closes would be ""Mobile Fighter G. Gundam"" if you don't know it, you need to get that as well.

So bottum line is, if you like a good fights with a good story like behind it, then this would be a great show to get! and that's all i can say.",1249084800,14,1478,4.171929824561404
3841984,4,B0023S4A2Q,"For anime fans, Shoji Kawamori and Hiroshi Onogi are both a legendary anime industry powerhouse duo.  The two are known for their work on the popular ""Macross"" (parts of the storyline is known in the US as ""Robotech"")  and ""Macross Plus"" series.

Kawamori is also known for creating anime series such as ""The Vision of Escaflowne"", ""Earth Girl Arjuna"" and known for his mechanical designs from Macross but also for series such as ""Eureka Seven"", ""Dangaio"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"".

Hiroshi Onogi is known for his many screenplays and writing for anime such as ""RahXephon"", ""Eureka Seven"", ""Mobile Suit Gundam MS Igloo"" and many other titles.

The two teamed up together again in 2005 with the anime studio Satelight, Inc. (a studio in which Kawamori is an Executive Director) to create the series known as  ""Genesis of Aquarion"" (Sosei no Aquarion) which aired on TV Tokyo from April 2005 to September 2005.  And in Japan, whenever Kawamori and Onogi team up, fans can always expect an entertaining and deep anime series.

""AQUARION"" takes place during a time in the planet in which human kind is facing near extinction.  The series takes place during a time when ""The Great Catastrophe"" had destroyed many areas around the world with many of the humans now living on the streets.  After the catastrophe, the Shadow Angels (winged-beings that have been dormant for nearly 12,000 years have re-appeared on Earth and use humans (aka ""wingless ones"") to harvest on.

Humans have become food for the Shadow Angels, who depend on humans to supply them with prana (life force) as a source of energy but also to feed their Tree of Life.

A human named Gen Fudou had excavated three advanced mecha fighters with absolute strength and the power to defend human kind against the Shadow Angels.  With Fudou gone missing, an organization known as Deava is responsible for the three machines known as Vectors and researching them and how it behaves in battle against the Shadow Angels but most importantly, how certain humans that are known to be ""Element Users"" can pilot and control them but can combine the vectors to create a powerful machine known as Aquarion.

Depending on which element users are using the machine, they can turn Aquarion into the following forms: Solar Aquarion, Aquarion Luna, Aquarion Mars, Aquarion Soluna and Aquarion Angel.

The series focuses on the adventures of the element users who work together and face challenges in their lives as pilots.  A lot of them don't know their true potential and a lot of them don't know the potential of the Aquarion, but everything changes when they encounter a young man living on the streets known as Apollo (who appears to have element capabilities)  but also a return of the man who discovered the Vectors, Gen Fudou.

Aside from the battle between the humans and the Shadow Angels, there is also a storyline about reincarnation and how certain element users may be tied to the ancient past.  We also learn about the drive of the Shadow Angels, especially with the character of a Shadow Angel named Toma who has this hatred towards the humans and we slowly discover why.

The following are the episodes featured on four DVD's in this complete series:

DVD DISC ONE:

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""AQUARION"" is a series that features cool character designs and vibrant animation.

The character designs are by Eiji Kaneda, who has graduated from hsi work as key animator for series such as ""Itazura na Kiss"", ""Nabari no Ou"", ""Ouran High School Host Club"" and now the character designer for ""AQUARION"".

With its many characters, each of these characters have their own distinct look and I absolutely enjoyed the overall designs of the anime series.  As for artistic backgrounds, we mostly see the Aquarion fighting in the blue skies or space and of course, many of the planet's surroundings from high above.  Where sometimes in an anime series, there is more emphasis on backgrounds and less on character designs, ""AQUARION"" is a series that tends to place most of the detail towards the characters and the mecha.

As for the audio, ""AQUARION"" is presented in English 5.1 Surround Sound and Japanese Stereo.  I watched the series with both languages and in a way, this is a series that delivers on both languages.  But the main difference is that the Japanese voice dubbing has many of their characters with a much deeper voice.  But nevertheless, both are well done when it comes to voice acting.

Of course, the biggest difference in the audio is that the English dub is in 5.1 Surround Sound and the action scenes are feature a good amount of LFE through the subwoofer and explosions generate nice booms through your front channel speakers.  Surrounds are also effectively used and overall, a pretty good audio soundtrack on DVD for this series.

The Japanese track is only in Stereo and for those who have a home theater setup and have a receiver capable of producing stereo on all channels can definitely enjoy the Japanese soundtrack.  This was my preference when listening to the Japanese audio.

As for subtitles, the series is presented with English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""AQUARION THE COMPLETE SERIES"" comes with the following special features:

  * Textless Songs: Viewers can enjoy the two opening theme songs and the ending theme without the text.
  * Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailers

JUDGMENT CALL:

""AQUARION THE COMPLETE SERIES"" is definitely an enjoyable and entertaining anime series. It's strength involves its storytelling but through character development.  Unlike a series such as ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" or ""Super Robot Wars"", there are no people who want to be heroes.  In fact, the humans really don't know what they're doing until Gen Fudou shows up and the group undergoes training and pushed to know their strengths and weaknesses.  Each storyline focuses on the growth of these characters.

Then you add the reincarnation scenes and it does lend to the excitement of the series and also an interesting and unique plot.  But Shoji Kawamori and Hiroshi Ohnogi who are true veterans in the mecha genre know that there are elements just overdone in a mecha series, so they went out and created a storyline that is fresh and unique.

It's important to note that there is a two episode OAV series titled ""Genesis of Aquarion"" (an alternate retelling of the TV series) but is not included in this complete series nor has it been released in the US just yet.

""AQUARION"" differs greatly from other mecha anime series in the way the mecha are used (there are only three mecha's but depending on each element user's ability, when merged as Aquarion, depending on who is leading, can bring out a different style of Aquarion) and also the storyline of reincarnation and more.

Also, a primary difference that makes this series differ greatly from other mecha series (and also gives this series its TV MA rating) is because when the three mecha's merge as Aquarion, ""merging"" is almost sexual.  The pilots go through a rush of pleasure during the transformation and the characters would scream out their feelings of merging.  In fact, there are episodes that deal with addiction to merging and even pilots who have never merged going to the experienced pilots and wanting to know how it feels to merge.

But for the most part, aside from the merging, ""AQUARION"" is not a series that features intense violence, nudity, profanity or anything like that.  It's probably more about the sexual innuendo that gives the series its TV MA rating.

Also, while the series does have its serious moments, there is plenty of humor and episodes such as ""Cosplay of the Soul"" in which Jun Lee is able to convince Deava to use cosplay as a form of communication for the pilots and learning about each other.  And of course, the rivals must cosplay each other.  So, Apollo has to cosplay as Sirus, Sirus as Apollo, Sylvia as Reika, Reika as Sylvia and of course, this episode is just all out funny as they group must go out to battle in character.  Which was quite interesting.

Another episode titled ""Merged to Eat"" as the pilots are scared that their partner Rena Rune maybe a vampire and start remembering incidents in which Rena would take care of their bloody wounds by immediately sucking on their wound.  A weird and dark episode but again, hilarious and entertaining.

And again, this series is all about mecha action and every episode features on Aquarion taking on various Shadow Angels but seeing the various pilots and the results of pairing three different element users and what kind of results they are able to get from various combination.  Again, an interesting concept for a mecha anime series.  And for those who have a home theater setup will like the use of the special effects and the utilization of all speaker channels.

For anime fans wanting a mecha series that is different from your average mecha series out there, you really can't go wrong with ""AQUARION THE COMPLETE SERIES"".

""AQUARION"" is an action-packed series featuring a pretty solid storyline, cool characters and a unique mecha concept. Definitely worth checking out!",1247702400,2,11111,4.878464818763327

3841986,4,B0023S4A2Q,"With titles such as Macross Plus and Escaflowne to his credit, it really comes as no surprise that mere mention of the name Shoji Kawamori stirs up excitement in mecha anime lovers such as myself. His latest creation, Aquarion, is the culmination of lessons learned from his previous endeavors coupled to the charm of a simpler time in animation. The plot, while not overly complex nor edited to appear more complicated than necessary, combines just the right elements of solid story telling to make Aquarion unique among a rich field of competitors.

The story's pretty straight forward: A Great Catastrophe has left the world in ruin and an ancient race of alien beings called the Shadow Angels have taken advantage of the weakened state of humanity to begin their assault on the planet (after 12,000 years of laying low). Earth's last hope and greatest defense against the threat comes in the form of the Mechanical Angel Aquarion. For those rolling their eyes at the fact that this story has been seemingly told again and again, take heart in the fact that this isn't just another cookie cutter giant robot show. In fact some of the nuances that make Aquarion unique among its competition can truly be called influential enough to spawn legions of imitators for years to come.

About the best way to describe the program would be to compare it to the shows it most closely emulates: Take the heavy mythological elements of RahXephon, combine them with the level of fun that made early 1980s giant robot shows so magical (think Vehicle Voltron) and finally top it all off with the victimized human element of The Matrix for good measure. If none of these comparisons strike a chord with your ability to decide whether or not Aquarion is right for you, read on. I'll break the show down on its own merit throughout this review. If however you are in fact familiar with the above analogies, there need not be another word said to influence your decision: This is giant robot action meets Atlantian mythology all done up in the crisp animation standards of today. In that regard it's worth the nostalgic undertones alone.

Perhaps the show's greatest contribution to the entire genre is the robot Aquarion itself. Sure the concept of three ultra-capable jet fighters combining to form a massive butt-whipping mecha is nothing new, the idea that the end result is completely dictated by the personalities of the three pilots involved certainly is. Known here as Elements, the individuals charged with the task of saving all of humanity one wild mechanized fistfight at a time play a far deeper role than simply glorified fighter pilots. Indeed this series makes interesting use of the concept of a person's aura as, depending on the combination of the three Elements involved in the conjunction, the Aquarion itself can basically take on limitless forms. Sorry Voltron, a single character isn't delegated the role of ""forming the head"" here but rather the position is up for grabs among the three Elements chosen to go out and do battle. Depending on which one snags the responsibility, Aquarion unites into a unique mode with special abilities including everything from archery, to the leg dexterity of a pro soccer player, to a punch with near endless reach.

Even cooler is that each Aquarion configuration has its own name, color motif and unique look. Part of the fun, especially early on, is determining each build's strengths and weaknesses. Aquarion literally becomes the personification of the ""head"" character's personality.

Villains in the show are standard fair aliens; humanoid beings bent on global conquest with a slightly ""classic mythological"" depth about them which is nice as it offers a unique contrast to the often-times bubbly nature of the cast of teenage good guys.

Perhaps the depth of the enemy is greatest realized in the 7th episode of the show, Knight of the Crimson Rose. Here the viewer is treated to a bit of art (poetry to be exact) and the consequence that negative emotion can inflict. The Shadow Angles capitalize on the arrogance and confidence of Aqaurion's pilots, literally forcing them to find strength through their weakness and fear.

About the oddest element this series brings to the genre would have to be the combination sequence itself. Since, as stated above, Aquarion interlocks not only mentally and physically but energetically as well, the show goes to great measures to illustrate the almost orgasmic sensation the pilots experience as they merge both with one another and the machine as well. While undeniably unique, it is a gimmick that is perhaps taken a bit far throughout the course of the 26 episodes. Especially since juvenile sexual references often pop up here and there with younger inexperienced pilots looking for what basically boils down to a sex-ed conversation from their superiors. However, I should note for sensitive viewers and concerned parents alike that the references are never pornographic or off color. The Mature rating that the show carries is certainly on the conservative side of the spectrum as really there is little here in the way of explicit violence, language, and so on.

This is a Funimation Entertainment release which, in case you aren't familiar, means the property is treated like a piece of fine art. The box, jacket, and disc art is simply top notch all the way. I often go on record as saying that with many companies you are simply buying dvds, with Funimation, you are immersing yourself in the total experience. Aquarion is no exception to this trend (although I will say that the inclusion of books as was the case with Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid would have been absolutely clutch). I'm personally quite excited to note that Funimation has decided to bundle up the previously two-volume release into a single box set. Cost for this box set is considerably less than ADV Films' single-box release of RahXephon (which is also a 26 episode series). Not only is the price better than it was to buy the two volumes, it's just nice that buyers won't have to track down two sets to enjoy the show in its entirety.

But I digress, back to the meat and potatoes of the show itself; the animation is spot-on throughout the entire series with a lush color pallet and spectacular textures. I mentioned the occasional depth displayed by the aliens but the intelligence behind their attacks pales in comparison to the mecha battles themselves. Releasing giant machines called Cherubims to the planet's surface, it is these skeletal-inspired beauties that Aquarion finds himself clashing with time and time again. In all honesty whatever shortcomings the plot suffers from (occasional tangents that do little to advance the overall prose) are more than made up for by the beautiful battle sequences. The battles maintain their status as spectacles to behold right on through to the end. The subdue Shadow Angel designs and sharp lines make for an awesome counterpoint to Aquarion's fluid curves and brighter color pallet.

Finally the series boasts a beautiful, moving musical score by Yoko Kanno. Think Escaflowne here with soaring orchestral pieces often infused with dramatic vocals.

In all, some criticize Aquarion for its inability to match the psychological depth of comparative shows such as RahXephon and Evangelion but I suspect that Shoji Kawamori's plan was to avoid falling into the pitfalls that plague such shows by resetting the proverbial clock on what makes good robot anime great. As such he makes it a very deliberate point to counteract the darker moments of the prose with an energetic and likeable main cast, creepy enemies with a bright, larger than life giant robot defender; splashes of light for every shadow.

Aqaurion is an enjoyable self-sustained series that does far better when judged on its own merits rather than it does by comparing it to similar entries. This is all made even better by the fact that it was released by Funimation- which means its loaded with extras and the attention to detail is without rival.",1239408000,22,8046,4.969539375928678

3842019,4,B0023S4A2Q,"Aquarion is a mecha based action adventure. Each mecha craft is controlled by a combination of three people. When the units combine the effect on the pilots is comically orgasmic. When I started watching this I thought it was comparable to Gravion or Gravion Zwei. I quickly realised that it isn't really. It does follow the basic format of a mecha anime which can be summarised as; some chat, bad guys show up and cause trouble, mecha fight, ending. Aquarioin does indeed follow this basic theme and the types of charcters will be vaugely familiar too. Where it scores is in the way the characters interact and how the plot develops.

Over the course of the series the range of adventures and variety of characters to keep you entertained. It borrows heavily on some of the concepts from Greek mythology and it's fun to spot them and see where they are taken. The final climatic episodes have some interesting moral choices and do not disappoint. Overall this is well done and worth watching.",1411257600,,993,4.7398843930635834

3842035,3,B0023S4A2Q,"I would give Aquarion a C+ rating.  It is very epic and has lots of great action sequences to keep you engaged.  Unfortunately, the story is very hard to follow.  There are a lot of characters and at times that takes away from the over all plot which is mankind trying to survive against the Shadow Angels.  There is more then enough cheese to go around.  Lots of clich&eacute;s.  Very similar to Evangelion- not as provocative or trippy and Razaphon- Lots of mythology but a little more driven then that series.  The acting is good.  Animation is top notch.  The music is wonderful.  It just is hard to follow and lacks consistency of great animes like Full Metal Alchemist or, as I mentioned earlier, Evangelion.",1395532800,,714,4.64

3842037,5,B0023S4A2Q,"Take a character, and have him remind you a little bit of Inuyasha. Take mecha, and have it remind you a little bit of Voltron or Thunderbirds 2086. Take an alien war against the race of humanity, and have it remind you a little bit of Robotech. And you get Aquarion.

At the same time, this series is set apart from all others. In having the ability to switch out pilots on the fly. Having character development within the war itself. Episodes that could stand alone, but also contribute to the main plot and make it smooth and flowing.

You also have some mythology put in, and characters that could remind you of great sphinxes.

There is little, if any, repeat usage of any cel stock. Each battle in itself is unique. Computer graphics add to the series. And the plot is not too complex for anyone to be able to follow.

I can't add much else that other reviewers have not already said. If you know and love the animes I have mentioned above, then you will love Aquarion. If the animes are unfamiliar, and you are an 80's nut, where have you been? Check those out, and then check out Aquarion. You won't regret it. I promise. ^_^",1382140800,,1133,4.380952380952381

The character development is pretty standard fare, with kid suddenly able to do all kinds of things and the usual cast. It doesn't waste time or apologize for getting to the meat and especially the flavor of the rest of the show. But continuity and logic aren't completely discarded either.

I like mecha anime and this one is definitely different, employing chakras, transformation, and combining different than anything I've seen. The additional layers of myth and techno magic really punch it up.

Good music. The skips are ok, but you cannot skip the opening track.

Every moment of the anime is so obviously well made and interwoven that I felt secure the entire time I watched this that I was getting a good show. If you like mecha anime, this is a must have.",1372896000,,949,4.630952380952381

3842043,2,B0023S4A2Q,"Aquarion is a pretty lame anime. The story has a lot of potential, the battle scenes are fairly decent, and there is an okay love story involved. The problems with this anime are pretty major though. The characters are kind of boring, the voice acting is bad, and the story drags sometimes. This anime had a lot of potential, but in the end it failed to impress. I have a lot of mediocre anime series that I keep just in case I get a wild hair to watch some of it later on down the road. Aquarion, however, is not one of those shows. As soon as I watched it, I took it to FYE and sold it to them for like 5 bucks. That is something I don't do unless an anime is really bad. It's in the same category of bad as 009-1, Beyblade, and Legend of Crystania.",1354579200,,751,4.013333333333334

After having watched it a second time now years later, I would have to say that it's not as good as I had remembered

Let me start off by saying that this show has some of the BEST music I've heard in any anime series period

The characters are well drawn and are likable. I would say that this series succeeds in it's first 10 episodes and then meanders til the last arc. As a complete box set it's pretty bare-bones, but for the price it's definitely worth checking out",1314662400,,649,4.102362204724409

3842049,4,B0023S4A2Q,"Aquarion is a ""love it or hate it"" series. It's all up to the viewer, so I'll make this brief.

It has a nice charm, and is really engaging. The visuals are absolutely gorgeious, and so is the music. Aquarion is directed by Shoji Kawamori, who did designs for Gundam and Transformers, and directed Macross (Or Robotech here) and Escaflowne.
And the soundtrack is by Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop and Turn A Gundam.

Aquarion is a series NOT to be taken seriously, in order to enjoy Aquarion fully, it's best to treat it as a comedy and your typical 70s or 80s Super Robot Show. Also, please note there might be a few plot holes, but more than likely, it will be patched by the upcoming sequel (As of this review), Aquarion EVOL. So it's up to you, the view to decide whether to see it or not. Also, for 20$ the most, Aquarion is a pretty good bang for your buck.",1299888000,,903,4.2748538011695905

3842052,3,B0023S4A2Q,"I'm sorry but this show needs to be brought down in ratings and fast!
 I bought part 1 at odd lots for three dollars and part 2 on rightstuf for 8, so I paid a total of 11 dollars. I had read reviews before, so I had low expectations going into this.

First thing I've got to admit is that after watching every episode, this show grew on me. But so did skim milk. When I drink 2 percent, I realize how much skim sucks. I'd give it a lower rating if it hadn't grown on me.

This is the most cliched anime I've ever seen. That's a big statement, since anime is almost nothing but cliches now, but its true. But forget cliches. Let's talk being unrealistic, and just plain rediculous. There's a dude that wears a soccer uniform 24/7 and has flame kicks. Isn't this a mecha show? How does he randomly have this mystic power? Nobody else has this ability, or any like it. He's not even the main character. Also, Aquarion's abilities are as impossible as Gurren Lagann. The difference being that Aquarion expects you to take it seriously. There's also a random girl in a wheel-chair who happens to be a vampire? Vampires are never mentioned in the entire series, and they never mention it after that. So why?

The main character is Apollo. He's likable enough, but his name might as well be Naruto. There's a cliche love interest. A cliche rival. There are cliche combining mecha, and when they combine, these kids have orgasms. Yep. It is especially disturbing when three dudes combine and have orgasms together. Talk about a sausage-fest.

The villains are shadow angels. They cry. Oh and smell flowers. Watch out!

Look, I should just review this show, and not mention others, but lets address the pink elephant. This show rips off Neon Genesis Evangelion. Badly. I'm not even gonna tell you why. Just watch any other anime instead, and say you saw this show, b/c in a way, you have.

The animation, art, music, all of that's great.

I'm not saying this is the worst anime ever, I'm saying, watch something else. This show is over the top and takes itself too seriously. If you like over the top fun. Watch Gurren Lagann. If you like weird mecha shows, watch Eva.",1294790400,4,2160,4.49234693877551

I am six episodes into it so far and it seems kind of spastic.  There are a number of good points/plot lines, but they seems to be added in almost randomly. The heroes combine to pilot a giant robot to defeat Borg (Star Trek) Evangelion Angel like creature.  The heroes are apparently students at a piloting school, but seem to be the only ones engaging in battle (i.e. why aren't the teachers in any of the battles)  The first half of each episode is school centered, and the second half is a battle. Things are added almost randomly into the story line, like a blind girl who seems to be a vampire, and a run through a Raiders of the Lost Ark maze.",1462752000,,766,4.120805369127517
