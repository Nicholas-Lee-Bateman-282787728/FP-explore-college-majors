Wendy Richard (from ""Are You Being Served"") was in it for a brief minute, I wish she had been in it longer, I always liked her voice.  A pretty tame film with only a few funny spots.",1510444800,,320,3.96875
8460195,3,B00571SL4O,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""DOCTOR IN CLOVER"" (aka: Carnaby, M.D.) (1966) (102 min/Color) -- Starring: Leslie Phillips, James Robertson Justice, Shirley Anne Field, John Fraser, Joan Sims

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

Another VCI restored film from the British Invasion vaults.

The sixth movie in the long-running ""Doctor"" comedy series sees the format begin to show it's age. The series, which had by now ran for over twelve years has now more or less lost it's direction.

In place of Dirk Bogarde's Simon Sparrow we have Leslie Phillips,who does his best with a script which abandons the wit of the earlier films and replaces it with second-rate slapstick.

The series had also lost the edge of the original Bogarde films, this being very much more slapstick.  Here Leslie plays 'Dr. Gaston Grimsdyke' (different character to the one he played in 'Doctor In Love'). Grimsdyke is after a job in America, but to qualify he has to be married, so he chases the lovely Jeannine (Elisabeth Ercy).

Once again James Robertson Justice's Lancalot Spratt is the main reason to watch this film, but the sub-plot (Spratt clashes with Matron Joan Sims, over his pet parrot)is possibly the weakest of the series and JRJ has all too few scenes, his character has now become a parody figure of fun.

I must mention the sublime Joan Sims as Matron Joanna Sweet. The party scene where she goes under the laughing gas is a blast, gets every time I see it.

It's watchable enough, thanks to the efforts of the cast, but should have been far funnier, not up to par.
