8040465,1,B00068WIU6,"On Amazon's Website it clearly states that the Format for this DVD is NTSC.
I received the item, unwrapped it, put it in my player and it DID NOT work, because it is actually in PAL format. Even tho the customer service employee was very friendly and we did come to a satisfying agreement on the refund, I m trying to save you from a headache! Unless your DVD player plays different Formats (not to be confused with Regions!!) DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!",1263168000,2,447,4.333333333333333
