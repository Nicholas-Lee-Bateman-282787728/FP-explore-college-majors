8187108,5,B000OXEP40,I've been looking for Russian massage stuff everywhere and this DVD turned out to be the perfect thing for me to learn all about the traditional massage of the Russians. It is a mixture of different theories but basically it is the real deal. I'd recommend it!,1348617600,,260,4.553191489361702
8187109,2,B000OXEP40,"I was born and grew up in Russia, and I had some training in Russian massage. I am also a certified massage practitioner here in the US, so I purchased the video with the purpose of reviewing of what I learned in Russia. I found the video not entirely useless, but only somewhat helpful. I wish instead of demonstrating cupping and honey massage Olena would focus more on the Russian massage techniques and demonstrated the application on the full body, not just the back.",1212969600,6,472,4.630952380952381
8187110,4,B000OXEP40,"Olena Adams is a master of massage. Under her skilled hands and intuitive guidance, energy flows and health is restored. I was thrilled to see that her Honey Massage technique was one of the therapies included in this production; this guarded healing treatment has been passed from medicine women & men to disciples for hundreds of years. The information presented on this DVD will enhance the skills of any massage therapist or offer easy to follow instructions for home use.

8187111,5,B000OXEP40,"I am a former student, and someone who has experienced these kinds of therapeutic massage techniques from Olena. I was thrilled with this DVD as a way for her to share her amazing talent, and her knowledge of the Art of Russian Massage with the rest of the world. It IS truly a gift. From the novice to the licensed practitioner, everyone can benefit from this. Many techniques are demonstrated in a short period of time. It is very easy to follow and understand. Great visuals!

8187112,5,B000OXEP40,"As a practicing massage therapist for 13 years, I've  seen my share of massage DVDs. This is one of the most comprehensive and well done DVDs I have watched. The novice massage therapist and even an experienced therapist will come away having learned something new. This DVD is a ""MUST HAVE"" for any massage school library. Well worth the time and money.
