2473949,5,B000CSUNMK,"This is the funniest show on TV (almost: see Arrested Development) and it is looking like this may have been the only season. I don't think that it is on anymore but who knows with MTV. Strange, sick comedy that your grandma won't get. I'd have to say that Clarence the puppet is my favorite.

2473950,5,B000CSUNMK,"I tore something in my lung I laughed so hard.  Had to shut it off and heal up for a few more days.

Consists of 8-9, 30 minute episodes.  The pilot ep was mostly cut-up and reused in the balance of the 1st season run.

Great absurdist parody of children's programming.  Does for ""Sesame Street"", what ""T.V Funhouse"" did for ""Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"".  The narration on the tour footage alone is amazing. The Hotdog factory and the Farm together is probably my favorite 5-6 minutes of footage in TV history.  Especially a treat for any generation X'ers who remember the grainy footage on the 70's era PBS kids shows.

There is one klinker episode, and the rest of them poke a lot of fun at the same religious and racial issues - to the point of being somewhat repetitive and exclusionary of other topics, but still more creative, funnier, more subversive, and better than any (and I mean ""ANY"") mainstream comedy out there.

Definitely worth the time and money.  Seek. Buy. Watch. Laugh.",1134950400,14,987,4.6531791907514455

2474039,5,B000CSUNMK,"Wonder Showzen is a refreshingly bold television show. In an era of television that indulges in political correctness, Showzen indulges in being unapologetically offensive and tasteless, making jokes at the expense of a wide range of taboo subjects including race, politics, and child abuse. Wonder Showzen perfects this offensive style humor.

The show takes the format of a faux-children's show and features many different segments, each with their own individual appeal. The mascots of the show are deranged and obscene puppets that serve as a parody of the lovable characters from Sesame Street. They came from Sesame Skid Row. Another segment features children saying wild and outrageous things. My personal favorite is when they go out onto the street to interview and annoy regular people, leading to hilarious results.

At times inventive, at times abstract, and always hilarious, Wonder Showzen is a must-watch for fans of politically incorrect humor. If you like South Park, Beavis and Butthead, or Chappelle's Show, then you'll love Wonder Showzen.",1395273600,,1059,5.412121212121212

2474051,5,B000CSUNMK,"I recommend Wonder Showzen to all of my friends who have a similarly demented sense of humor to my own. It's definitely not the right show for everyone--or even most people. But, if your twisted humor can stomach it, I guarantee it will change your life. The show's disclaimer really says it all: ""Wonder Showzen contains offensive, despicable content that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children. The stark, ugly and profound truths Wonder Showzen exposes may be soul-crushing to the weak of spirit. If you allow a child to watch this show, you are a bad parent or guardian.""",1387756800,,593,4.823529411764706

I was blown away by it-the black humour and sheer crassness beats 99% of anything else shown by MTV, before or since. I love this show, and the first season was the best. On the other hand, if you've never seen this show before, don't order this until you can watch a clip or two elsewhere.",1370995200,,399,4.405405405405405
2474056,5,B000CSUNMK,"This show is funny as hell, but definitely has a niche target audience. Ranging from clever to disgusting to just plain bizarre; this was, in my opinion, the only thing that aired on MTV2 that was ever worth watching.",1360540800,,217,4.589743589743589
2474057,4,B000CSUNMK,"This show seems to have been developed from the ground up to make the user say ""WTF?!,"" and in that area it excels. This f'ed up version of Sesame Street (with puppets looking like what those on Sesame Street might look like in a radioactive post-apocalyptic world) seems to take place in some alternate universe where nothing is shocking and everything you know as normal is turned on its head. You never know what's coming next with this show, and you have to wonder what scars the children actors of ""Wonder Showzen"" will carry forth into their adult lives. The segments can alternate between funny, unsettling, confusing and just plain weird. I'll go out on a limb and speculate that this show is probably best viewed under the influence of mind-altering substances.

While I do enjoy this show for the most part, there have been scenes here and there that have stuck with me (in a negative way) that I would have preferred not to have seen - for example, there's a scene where a basket of live baby chicks is lowered into a vat of boiling oil. As an animal lover (but admittedly a meat eater), I can't stand seeing stuff like that and that scene alone has honestly prevented me from going back and watching this show (because I can't remember what episode it happened on and when, and I really don't ever want to see it again). Less sensitive viewers might not have the same reaction, but I thought I'd mention it because this scene is unfortunately now what pops into my head when I think about ""Wonder Showzen.""",1358812800,,1518,4.580882352941177

2474059,5,B000CSUNMK,"This show is NOT for the feint of heart. It it totally disgusting and really should not be viewed by anyone (particularly children, seniors, anyone with a heart condition, anyone with morals, etc). But, good lord, it is FUNNY. Seriously hysterical. It's rotten to the core, but I can't help but laugh through the entire thing. Even the packaging is disgusting and crude and utterly hilarious. If you're offended by a faux fur merkin right on the cover of the dvd case...well, then you probably shouldn't have this dvd in your hand at all. This makes South Park look like The Cosby Show. Priceless.",1357948800,2,597,4.75
2474084,5,B000CSUNMK,"If you are offended by this, you're not paying attention. If you are going to do a satire of a children's show, you must go all out and defend everyone.

2474085,5,B000CSUNMK,"WARNING!!! This show is not for children or for people that are overly sensitive to race! This show is for people who have a healthy appetite for sick satire. When they sing about ""White People, Having Fun, Global Domination Over Everyone...""and ""Genecide For Anyone Who Isn't White..."" you have to understand that the writers are trying to create a much needed dialogue among those of us who believe that that kind of thinking is wrong. The show will make you think, talk and laugh. We're never going to get over race issues in this country unless we develop and pursue a healthy and humorous dialogue. I say the show is genius because it does just that but like I said, it's not for people who are easily offended.",1310428800,,716,4.6015625
2474086,5,B000CSUNMK,"That's right, I'm making that claim: Wonder Showzen is the smartest, funniest show to ever last longer than one season. Really, I'd say ""ever"", but who cares. Now, some people will not like this show, but for those who appreciate dark comedy, you will know what I mean. It may take two or three episodes to get on WS's wavelength, but once you're on it, you will agree that it is unsurpassed. Sometimes the show can seem a bit dumb, but keep at it. If you are one of the lucky ones who can enjoy this masterpiece, you will never enjoy anything else as much. Every month, I break out both seasons and watch it all the way through: It's that good. However, I'd suggest that you start with season 2 if you're planning on seeing this show for the first time. It's a bit better than season 1, and maybe more accessible.

Do not let this show pass you by. Everyone should own this DVD.",1291507200,,879,4.295180722891566

2474089,2,B000CSUNMK,"At first, I thought that this would be a show that you either love or hate. Little did I think that I'd like the first few episodes and then grow from disappointment to anger at the last four or five. In short, the repetition of the different segments grows tiresome and superfluous. Often black comedy gets funnier the better equipped you are to expect the joke. Not so here. The kids talking gets trite, the plots grow mundane in their radicalism (yes), and Clarance, the puppet who harasses strangers on innocent premises, is NEVER funny.
The show did admit on a segment called ""funny. not funny"" that it itself was not funny, so perhaps there's more than just irony to that statement. But it fails at performance art as well.
To accredit myself somewhat, I'm a graduate student whose thesis is on some very black comedy. Laughter at what one doesn't laugh at deeply interests me, but what I find here is an uncreative over-dependence upon its formula. The show completely collapses into that disaster of a last episode where the topic Patience is made over and over into the same 'joke' of prolonging and delaying the show to force the audience to be patient for a real joke. They then admit their fault and to turn back the damage, they literally replay all 15ish min of the unfunny material backwards. With the last few minutes, they switch into ""Speed"" and rush through what would have been the show you might have hoped to watch when you had hit play. What, if played with, could have been conceptually interesting simply makes the viewer mad at the show; so frustrated as to write a review explaining why his time has just been wasted. Wonder Showzen gives up completely on comedy. Like junkies, they rely more and more upon shock value until they've passed out and pissed themselves.
To give an example of effective black comedy, take the intro to the recent South Park episode where the ginger kid is killed while doing the morning announcements. While you listen jaw agape to a gunman yelling at the kid who has the same name of the guy who's been sleeping with the gunman's wife (a mix up that's funny, but impossible to laugh at itself during the screams), you're paralyzed like the 4th grade class that the camera stays on for the scene's duration. A boring scenario (announcements) is placed on top of an intense one (murder). As a viewer, you're well conditioned to respond to both appropriately, but when mixed together, you're made aware of your different lenses as you bumble in the attempt to use both at the same time. After the climax, the scene switches to a memorial for the kid, showing a super cheezy/sweet photo of the kid you have been kept from seeing the whole time. Immediately, you can laugh. This artful shift lets you laugh at yourself, at your confused emotions over something so fake and on-the-surface as that hallmarky photo. Your automatic emotional reaction at such violence is made ridiculous by the non-character ginger you have no reason to care about in the first place.
This is effective black comedy. Wonder Showzen is just the yelling and the screaming with little comic construction.

2474107,5,B000CSUNMK,"This show is not the slightest bit funny; but there is a reason I laugh when I watch it.  It is the same reason I hate mysef when I use a semi-colon.  What a useless, senseless, bulls**t grammatical device.  Or when I try to disguise the word bulls@9t.  What the hell is wrong with everbody?  Irony is really no longer possible.  When I laugh at something clever, maybe even insightful, on the Simpsons, a wonderful show, it is because I am still clinging to the idea that irony may not be dead - that things may have not reached the point of absolute absurdity.  I like irony.  I don't want to be dead.  Unlike the zealots, I am not interested in the end of the world.

And, I'm sorry, but I need to take a second to ask a simple question.  Why can we not, at the very least, confront and refute the christian right in the country.  Even you christians (like there would be any reviewing this show [although, I wouldn't put it past those bastards, {unless they were of the non-fanatical variety, which...}])!@#$%^&*(  I mean, which is more pessimistic, Wondershowzen, or CBN?  Yeah, Pat Robertson cares about kids.  Sure.  But only the Christian ones, right Pat.  Because the rest of them are going to hell real soon anyway, right? That's what you tell everyone to believe, right?

Anyway, I laugh, but it is the laugh of defeat.  It's all over.  It's just nice to see a t.v. show that is not contributing to the annihilation of the human race.  Wondershowzen merely points out the simple truths that are systematically and necessarily overlooked in order to live at all in this diseased, dying culture.  This dying world.

If you are still observant and aware, yours is the laugh of the dying man.  If you really think it's funny, you are already dead.",1186358400,4,1754,4.5303514376996805

My stoner friend that watches the cartoon network whenever possible, brought this DVD to my apartment.  Let me just say, that I appreciate strange humor, but this was not humor.  Anyone could make a show like this.  People think its so clever and funny because its outrageous.  I agree with the outrageous, but that does not make it funny to me. South park on the other hand has awesome characters, has genious satyrical plot lines, and is truly funny, it does not just rely on outlandishness.  By the third episode of this DVD, I had probably truly only laughed (about as weak as a laugh as you can have) 2 times.  Also, I would have rather bathed in hot lava then to watch one more episode, it was that bad.  I would rather watch 3 episodes of Family Matters than watch one more of Wonder Showzen.

Virtually the same idea, framed in a throw-back-y kiddie show format, featuring debauched ""ani-pals"" (both puppet and real live animals) engaged in utterly reprehensible behavior (abusing a certain inhaled hallucinogen powder --- street name: Christmas Cheer; engaging in interspecies orgies and pervasive drunkenness; hanging out with Robert Goulet and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog in Atlantic City; running away to Tijuana for the weekend, etc), sprinkled with dead-on sociopathic parodies of Gen-X cultural touchstones (Rankin-Bass seasonal claymation, post-Scooby Doo-era cheapo cartoons, perky kids' safety shows, etc)... snarkier, darker, and more deadpan than the fuzzy muppet-like characters, Sesame Street knocks, and Andy Milonakis/Crank Yankers ""stoopid"" sensibilities that characterize SHOWZEN.

Not that there's anything wrong with ""stoopid"", but TV FUNHOUSE is truly funnier AND more outrageous by an order of magnitudes over WONDER SHOWZEN. Plus, it was the original recipe. If you got money to burn, and you want to see something really entertaining that works the ""sick-n-twisted kid show parody"" angle, get schooled in TV FUNHOUSE first. Then, if you have some change left over, and there's nothing else to buy, WONDER SHOWZEN might do in a pinch.",1157587200,3,1439,5.783018867924528
2474138,3,B000CSUNMK,"I was hoping this 8 episode(about 28 minutes each)series had more Clarence(blue puppet)interview bits,but unfortunately there are not that many. Still,the kids are cute and funny most of the time,and there are many things to enjoy here besides Clarence anyway. However,I had to force myself to watch the painful puppet-only skits, which are mostly a complete waste of time! Thankfully,I decided to use the fast forward button during most of this garbage!

Note:For those of you who want a quick way to access the mostly useless EASTER EGGS(only the one with Clarence is funny-Disc 2,TITLE #15)with your DVD player,here's how. You'll need a good DVD player that lets you access TITLES (no, I don't mean CHAPTERS).I used my Panasonic,but my cheap Claritone DVD player couldn't do it. Put in the disc and wait till you get to the main title screen of Wonder Showzen(takes a while to get through all the disclaimers),or it will even work while you're watching an episode.
Then for DISC #1:select each of the following five TITLE #'s one at a time: # 7; #8; #9; #10; #11.
For DISC #2:Do the same as above except select from these three TITLE #'s: #14; #15(Clarence); #16.
After each one finishes you'll have to wait till the Dvd loads up to the main title screen again(about 50 seconds),unless you choose the next TITLE # before current one you're watching ends.

 The GOOD:
-I love the Clarence(blue puppet)interview bits

-some of the Beat Kid stuff

-some cartoons like:Plastic Surgeons Without Borders(episode #2-Space,@ 9:49-11.26);D.O.G. O.B.G.Y.N(episode #7-Health,@ 2.34-4:40);Hobo Ops(episode #3-Ocean, @6:49-9:30,last few seconds are edited out) and a Special-Olympics super-hero cartoon(Season 2 preview)

-The Chicken Dinner Factory short is cutely spoken by the kids and is also well written(episode #6-History,@13.10-15.13)

-little girl singing ""Pretend To Believe""(about God,episode #2,@15:07-15:36.)

-We Went To the Farm:the kid's dialogue is funny(episode#2,@ 16:57-18:49)

-some of the kid's Q&A (Questions and Answers)

-Dear Jesus,from episode #8-Patience @18:09,very short but funny

-DVD extras: has bit more Clarence,out-takes,story time with Flava Flav etc.

There were many more things that made me chuckle or laugh out loud,but the ones mentioned above are some that still stand out in my mind as I write this.

The BAD:
-so many sick and twisted things that initially appear shocking,but because there are so many of them,they quickly began to just sicken me. Yuck!

-Episode #8-Patience:though it has the wonderful Clarence bit on patience(@ 5:37-11:09),it is the worst episode of the 8,and then they decide to rewind the show(from 11:26-17:42)back to the beginning-even the audio commentary is backwards. Pure stupidity!

-the kid singing, ""Dvd extras"" over and over again on it's title screen. Will someone please strangle him!

The UGLY:
-as mentioned before,the awful puppet-only skits. I forced myself to watch many of them,but because it's much worse than Sesame Street on crack could ever be,I had to fast-forward through most of them!

-the audio commentary is all useless and boring,though the first minute of commentary by the Stephen Hawking sound-alike is bearable and worth a chuckle or two,if you're in a good mood perhaps.

-Wonder Showzen's god awful ""Kids Show"" theme song that begins each episode. It's bearable the first time only! It also plays over and over again at the main title screen and forced me to quickly make my selection or else I'd be tempted to kill myself! Though,because I just reminded myself of this song,I've just taken 40 sleeping pills. I hope that's enough to do the job!

The VERDICT:
Most people really love this show and many people hate it. I fall somewhere in between. I'm glad I watched it,but there's no way I'll be watching season 2. If they release a Wonder Showzen-Best of Dvd, WITHOUT those lousy puppet-only skits,then I'll watch some more. Otherwise you can take those puppet-only skits and shove 'em where the sun don't shine.

The bonus content is hilarious, including Story Time with Flava Flav about The Boy in the Red Cap. Priceless Episodes. I'd have to say my favorite things on this DVD are the D.O.G.O.B.G.Y.N. quick skits, Beat Kids, and the Pig Slaughterhouse/Hotdog Factory episode.

2474145,5,B000CSUNMK,"the genius of ""Wonder Showzen"" lies in the fact that not only is it not a children's show (although on the surface it plainly appears to be one), it is the exact OPPOSITE of a children's show. It's a frankly anarchistic and truly guerilla theater-style attempt to subject the American public to pure evil. Watching this show is like opening a Pandora's Box of all things repellent, nerve-touching, and hilarious. Many things make the claim but Wonder Showzen is a one-of-a-kind, true-blue, honest-to-goodness wolf in sheep's clothing.

This isn't really even a show. It's more an avant garde work of art. It's an effing miracle this ever got aired.

""Wonder Showzen"" is such a well-fashioned parody of all those PBS children's shows we loved in the 70s (like ""Sesame Street"") where children interact with cute puppets and learn their ABCs and sing songs, etc, that it seems to have slipped right underneath the radar. There's a legitimate danger that this show is so brilliant, in fact, that it may slide right out of existance. Some things are just that far ahead of their time.  Hopefully not. I can't see this going mainstream. In fact, I PRAY it does not. Some things should (!!!!!!!!!!) be left underground. And I don't mean that they don't deserve to go above-ground. I mean that success and mainstream acceptance ALWAYS dilutes a pure work. This is why I hope it stays below ground where it can continue to work its magic.

Also, not since the Butthole Surfers ambushed the rock and roll underground in the mid-1980s with their ""Locust Abortion Technician"" album has a group of entertainers made such mind-bending and scary use of distortion, subliminal and hidden images/messages, speeded-up sound, and looped-tape.

Like this show starts with the premise that everything that appears wholesome must be inherently corrupt, and there's no discretion in choosing targets. It's not really subversive because the idea of being cynical towards everything wholesome is something that has been getting more and more acceptance lately. It's not an original idea, and it's sure as hell not their idea. They do consistently take their shock tactics so far that I can hardly believe the show got made though. If you're looking for something that makes South Park and Family Guy seem tame, this is the show for you. They treat everything horrific in the world as a harsh truth they're righteously exposing, or celebrating, it's never really clear. The one thing that is pretty consistent is their lack of anything relevent to say about their subject matter. It's mostly constant juxtapositions of everything that is wholesome and innocent in the world with everything that is horrific or corrupt.

It's obviously aimed at stoners who are gonna put it on and go ""Awesome.........it's like a warped Sesame Street dude, it's sooooo twisted"", but the truth is, is that in this day and age, this is not even mildly shocking. The whole ""joke"" is that it's a kids show, but much blunter, and once you get that joke, it repeats it over and over, episode after episode, with irritating kids songs that aren't at all funny thrown in too. I watched about 4 or 5 episodes before giving up, as I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, and in that whole time, I think I did about 3 mildly-blow-out-of-your-nostrils-once laughs. Seriously unfunny.",1148860800,7,899,4.521472392638037
2474182,4,B000CSUNMK,"In a culture where everything is ironic and everyone is trying to be shocking, it's difficult to find anything in entertainment that actually feels new and original. Wonder Showzen is one of those rare programs that has managed to push it's way past everything else and demand to be seen. The humor is refreshing and nothing is sacred or off limits. Some people may find some of the storylines and shorts to be highly offensive, but that is simply because they're not thinking about what the creators are really trying to say, and yes, the show is funny and entertaining, but there is some very deep social commentary being made in each episode.
Unfortunately, someone at Paramount Pictures (the company that is distributing the DVD) decided that some of the social commentary needed to be silenced for this DVD release. During the ""Ocean"" episode, there's a great animated short called ""H.O.B.O. Opps"". The short is about how America always fails to take care of their war veterans. And even though the veterans in the short are from the Vietnam war, their situation can be applied to how many of our current veterans from Iraq are coming home wounded and unable to pay their bills and medical bills thanks to our inadequette health care system. Two parts of this short have been cut from the DVD. First, the audio of one of the hobos urinating in public was removed, in the hopes that now the viewer won't be able to tell what this character is doing. And second, the end of the short was cut altogether. If you catch the rerun on MTV2, it ends with a young boy asking his mother ""who that man was talking to"" and she tells him to ignore the man. The camera then zooms in on a tear rolling down the boy's face that has a reflection of the American flag in it and the flag bursts into flames. This was the perfect way to end the short and it really drives the artist's message home, but it's gone from the DVD release, which is a shame. It amazes me how conservative people in this country who claim to be so patriotic, are always the first to try to censor or ban opinions, speech and art that differs with their beliefs.

So, I love Wonder Showzen and highly recommend it to everyone who loves cutting edge comedy laced with truth and social commentary. However, be aware that this set is edited so be sure to watch the show on MTV2 to get the full experience.

2474183,5,B000CSUNMK,"First episode I saw, I thought the show was racist, INCREDIBLY TASTELESS, offensive, overall insulting and completelly disrespectfull towards every single moral value of our society. I thought also the show as it was should be banned and maybe taken off the air. Then, a week later when I saw another episode I was laughing so hard I could barelly breathe.

This show simply has no limits in itself about taboo subjects, it's very political and very raw/blunt/limitless. The people that make this show besides obviously being on drugs while writting it, they also just don't care about ANYTHING whatsoever, meaning that they won't give a damn if anyone gets insulted by anything they are saying or potraying. For a little example, almost every single show has a sex scene between puppets.

This show breaks every single moral rule and yeah, it will get you pissed, it will make you angry, it will ofend you, mostly you will be saying time after time "" I cannot believe they said that"" or ""did that"". That's why this show is so entertaining.

If you haven't seen this show, just imagine the TOM GREEN SHOW, JACKASS, ANDY MILONAKIS, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, MAD TV, CHAPPELLE SHOW and SESAME STREET, all mixed up, times a MILLION and WAY MORE EXTREME than any of these shows together.

Yes, it's that good.

Also, I forgot to mention that the show has a very fast pacing, everything happens so fast that you will miss 99% of the punchlines 'cause some of them are so ahead of it's time that you will have to give it a minute. Also, VERY SUBLIMINAL. Very fast images, hidden content ( like pictures flashing at 1 frame per second ) reversed talk, reversed audio messages.

The DVD has lots of extra features.

Disc 1:

Commentaries: The commentaries have very little to with the episodes.

Steven Hawking (Space): Obviously not him, but sounds like his electronic thing and says lots of weird things.

PFFR (Diversity): Just music by the band played throughout the episode.

Dick Gregory (Nature): He has some funny things to say but it is mostly political advice for young people.  There is one section where he is censored to make a very scientific part of the commentary sound like he is saying lots of bad words.

Easter Eggs:

Not sure how to access them from the menu (if possible) but they are Titles 7-11 and easily accesible through Windows Media Player

7 - Chauncey and the Letter N sing a song about things that start with N.

8 - An extended scene with Tyler with the feather in the straw hut.

9 - An extenstion of Tyler doing the silly walk down the street.

10 - A kid interviewing in the studio some guy who is the ""president"" Very weird and funny.

11 - The producers talking to a kid about a jaguar. Also very weird and funny.

Disc 2:

Commentary:

Gordon Lish (Patience) - Sounds like he's having a conversation at a restaurant with the creators and they do their own little Patience repetition and a couple of other words that sound funny but I have no clue as to what they mean.  Is played backwards during the second part of the episode and fast during the speed part.

Extras: The menu page has a kid (I think the one who does the air guitar during Slaves and might play a guitar in the series doing a ""DVD extras"" song.

Auditions and Outakes: Several minutes of interaction between the producers and the kids in the studio scenes, a couple of extras with Miss Amy, one where the kids are all skeletons and another where she arranges the dead baby thing with her husband, and Rufus Truthfist getting the teens to say something that a dirty mind can make very inappropriate.

Beat Kids Outakes: Has some extra scenes for the five best beat kids (the 4 with Trevor and the Petting Zoo). Some of the questions make absolutely no sense.

Clarence Outakes: Has some more funny Clarence things.

Promos: short little clips of season 1

PFFR Music video: has all the crazy animation like during Chauncey's trip on imagination.

Sneak peak of a second season cartoon: it's alright, about retarted people who are superheroes, don't do anything heroic and are still praised for their work

Storytime with Flava Flav: Probably the funniest thing on the whole set. Definitely not appropriate for Television.

Some previews for other MTV DVDs

Easter Eggs: Titles 14-16

14 - The kids teach you how to make a sandwich. With a variety of kid personalities.

15 - Clarence gets the old Asian guy from Patience to say some stupid things.

16 - A girl counts down from 100. Another patience tester.

-

This show is Genius... absolute genius!  Wonder Showzen takes a dark, satirical look at what we are really teaching our children (?)

During the average episode it will have puppets interacting with children in sesame street style antics and of course going out on the street to ask people questions (The Clarence skit about Patience is priceless!), funny little cartoons (`Bible Brew... What would Jesus Brew?') , strange voice-overs old educational footage (Like the chicken dinner factory...) and my favorite segments with the children doing interviews... titled BEAT-KIDS (`Kids on the Street, Kids on the beat, Beat-Kids! Beat-Kids')

All in all, this is a priceless disc like nothing you have ever seen or could imagine trying to describe it is damn near impossible...

I lies somewhere between the witty satire of `The Daily Show' mixed with the raunch of `South-Park' and presented by kids that are too cool for Sesame Street.  Just Freakin Awesome!!!

2474255,5,B000CSUNMK,"Wonder Showzen is an educational program for children.  With childrens' programming, there is a sensitive boundary between laughter and learning.  Wonder Showzen is 'hip' enough that kids will be both entertained and enlightened - the show is so colorful and energetic that the lessons will never bore them.  For example, slavery is normally a sensitive topic for kids to be exposed to, but Wonder Showzen turns this notion on its head by showing kids dancing around to a catchy singalong in celebration of the fruits of slave labor: pyramids, the Parthenon, and America.  Elaborate but important concepts are condensed and made easily digestible, as when we learn about America's honored 'pay-to-play legal system'.  A favorite segment of mine shows children how to accept life's catastrophes in the context of God's will - whether it be a car crash, or two countries having an ethnic rivalry - just smile and chalk it up to God having one of his 'biggest boners'.  If and when I have children of my own, this is definitely what they're watching every morning before school.",1137283200,26,1075,4.977653631284916

I love it.

It surreal delicious!",1136246400,7,169,4.6
8102136,5,B000CSUNMK,This show is an absurdist masterpiece and I can't believe I was only made aware of its existence now.,1524873600,,101,4.368421052631579
8102137,5,B000CSUNMK,Hilarious show! Don't let kids in the room though...the cover full of puppets is misleading to people that are not already familiar with the show. It brings back fond memories of my 20's.. ADULTS ONLY,1524441600,,200,4.742857142857143

8102141,1,B000CSUNMK,I'm having trouble with 1st disk of DVD set. I can't get menu selection to highlight or accept commands. As a result I can't get any episodes to play. When I select Play All it goes through into two production credit sequences and then back to main menu. The disk looks fine. Please advise?,1486339200,,290,4.388888888888889

8102143,1,B000CSUNMK,I bought as a gift and the movie cover looks like it was printed off of a home printer. It looks nothing like the manufacturer packaging. That's disappointing because I don't have any idea what the disc inside will be like and I don't have time to reorder. I owned this myself before purchasing this one so I know that the packaging should look just like the one displayed. I'm not happy about this purchase.,1483833600,,408,4.453333333333333
8102144,5,B000CSUNMK,A must have cult classic. This is definitely not for children and is best described as Sesame Street on LSD,1482019200,,107,4.4
8102145,2,B000CSUNMK,I really love this show but im kinda disappointed that there are no close captions.  I'm also really disappointed that the Dick Gregory commentary on disc 1 is edited with a HUGE section with constant prolonged bleeping. =/,1473033600,,223,4.868421052631579
