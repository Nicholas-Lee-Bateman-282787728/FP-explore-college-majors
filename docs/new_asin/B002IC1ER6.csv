8370782,4,B002IC1ER6,"This video could be taken as a prequel to The Truth And Lies of 9/11, as the material he goes through in this video is very similar.  As it is a college seminar given in a classroom setting, the style of presentation he uses is somewhat different than in the other video.  However, it's value to me is in being able to witness how his presentation evolved from this into the other video, and in the differences between the two videos.  His information is well-sourced, and he makes a convincing case, in my view.",1361664000,,512,4.425531914893617
8370783,4,B002IC1ER6,"I essentially agree with Javier Rodriguez's review, which is that this is well-researched, important, and could have been presented better.  But I want to give it an extra star because this is such good stuff, and a good wedge into the topic of the critical interplay among intelligence work, the drug trade, and how Wall Street operates.  It's true, the video does not impart a comprehensive and solid understanding of exactly how drugs affect Wall Street.  It suffers somewhat from innuendo rather than full explanation.  For example, Ruppert shows how basically all the heads of the CIA have been Wall Street men.  That's a telling detail, but it doesn't explain exactly how it plays out.

But he's got good documentation, showing for example incontrovertible evidence that Wall Street actively solicits drug money from drug lords, going on junkets to ask these guys to invest their ill-gotten gains in the stock market.  Stuff like this actually makes the papers, but in small print and goes largely uncommented on.  Ruppert's skill is in amassing these things and underlining them, interconnecting them, and suggesting at least the beginnings of the big picture of what's really going on around here.  Yes, you'll still have questions.  A topic like this takes a lot of research.  You could do worse than starting here, although it is in many respects an ""advanced class"" if you're brand new to the subject.",1311984000,,1412,5.017167381974249
