1797483,5,B00007149J,"Compelling drama made possible through the BBC and Masterpiece Theater.  I was 15 years old when I first watched this brilliant adaptation of the John Galsworthy novel.  I remember feeling glued to my television anticipating each episode.  My local PBS Station aired it nightly in the summer of 1971.  I only watched it once and I have never forgotten how wonderfully it possesed romance, despair, ambiance, mystery, intrigue, scandal and turn of the century social morals.  Susan Hampshire, Eric Porter and the late Nyree Dawn Porter truly give this production the life and spirit of the novel. The ""special features"" of this DVD Set contain so many interviews and glimpses of England at the time of the filming.  These are priceless interviews that I would have never been able to see because of the age of the production. Anyone purchasing this DVD Set will not be disappointed! One of the best buys for the money you will ever find!",1046995200,2,936,4.855345911949685
1797484,5,B00007149J,"I received my Forsyte Saga - The Complete Series late last week and by Sunday night was into the third disk. It was as wonderful as I remembered it being, even though it is in black and white, obviously filmed for the most part on a sound stage, and, yes, most of the actors are older than the characters they portray. But what a cast! The wonderful Eric Porter makes Soames the rich character that Galsworthy called The Man of Property. That Soames truly loves Irene but cannot help treating her as a possession shows clearly on Porter's face and in his mannerisms. His reaction when Irene tells him she loaths him is difficult to watch -- you truly ""feel his pain,"" as disbelief changes to shock and bewilderment. The lovely Nyree Dawn Porter is the perfect Irene, and younger than the sadly miscast actress who portrays the same character in the new version. This Irene is full of repressed emotions under a placid surface -- she is the spokeswoman for Galsworthy's belief that people should not be married unless there is a spark, an irresistable attraction that draws them together, which is totally lacking in her feelings for Soames. Kenneth Moore is a more than adequate Young Joloyn, although he was a little too old for the role at age 53. The rest of the cast is equally wonderful, especially the elderly character actors and actresses who portray the aunts and uncles -- they are as vital and interesting in this version as in the books, not afterthoughts, as they are in the 2002 adaptation. Unlike the new version, the script stays close to the original -- no gratuitous modern sexual innuendos from the female characters, for instance, which seemed to me to be an attempt to pander to a younger audience. Yes, I agree that the new version is inhanced by color, grander sets, and better makeup...the actresses in The Complete Series do make one wonder if there were any eyeliner and false eyelashes left in all of England by the time the series was completed! But those are minor complaints....the brilliant case and inspired writing make this DVD set well worth owning and viewing for years to come.",1046649600,71,2114,4.7008086253369274
1797485,5,B00007149J,"It was known as ""appointment television"" ---an imported reason for viewers to stay glued to their TV sets for 26 consecutive Sunday evenings. Indeed, ""The Forsyte Saga,"" the epic miniseries based on John Galworthy's novels, was one of the first global small-screen phenomena; the sweeping Victorian epic that chronicles the trials and tribulations of a wealthy English family broke barriers as to how sandal, and yes, even sex was portrayed on TV. Veddy, veddy ahead of it time. The rarely-seen saga (it was rebroadcast only once in the U.S. since it original 1969 airing) is now available in a glorious box set --- seven discs that not only include 22 hours of viewing, but there are also rarely-seen interviews with the cast that were taped during the filming of the last ""Saga"" segment. Pop lots of corn, switch on the phone answering machine, order in ... and feast. And feast. And feast ...",1045008000,4,895,4.856209150326797

1797609,4,B00007149J,"A very good adaption of the novels, overall. I should probably give this five stars but, since I am rating the movie and not the delivery, etc., I must admit to a major disappointment: miscast characters. The very worst being Irene. Even if you haven't read the novels you will probably find yourself wondering, ""Am I lacking in the ability to recognize beauty?"" Galsworthy defined Irene as very beautiful, even comparing her to Venus and, though Gina McKee appears very attractive at times, she mostly comes across as quite homely. In a couple of ill-chosen hats, she reminded me of the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz. This may seem like a trivial aspect of the movie, but when you have the other characters constantly telling us how lovely/beautiful/fetching she is, it gets rather irritating, to the point where you want to get an eye exam AND find the casting director and whack him a few times. The positive aspect of the Irene character is that she is much more caring and not as remote as in the novels. McKee does a good job overall. The other characters were okay. Young Jolyen and June were wonderful. Soames? Despicable  as ever. There are scenes that are supposed to gain my sympathy and I only wanted to see him punished. He comes across as relentless, and a bit of a maniac.",1507680000,,1292,4.6173913043478265

1797614,2,B00007149J,"Let me say first I somewhat enjoyed the series - however it was certainly not even close to the quality of Downton Abbey - and didn't not flow- it was choppy- suddenly the next scene was either years later or months later and you don't get any explanation of what major events happened in between  - they either cut scenes or the screen writers were high when they wrote some of the episodes .
In addition , Gina McKee was a horrible choice for Irene- way too old for the earlier episodes (a woman in her 40's playing an 18year old ?  - & way too tall and although the actress is attractive , she certainly isn't the incredible beauty that Irene is supposed to be. And I honestly don't think the acting was that good at all- reminded me a little bit of the overly dramatic acting in the early days of movies .",1504569600,,809,4.212903225806452

Fans of DOWNTON ABBEY and UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS will probably enjoy this continuing saga taking place in about the same period.. Interestingly, though, it seems to differ in that the characters are not necessarily likable or charming, instead all being more flawed than not without any particularly wonderful traits, ordinary/average at best though they are compelling and sometimes one empathizes with them.

He is a superb actor and portrayed this character as it is his own real life story to tell. It got me and my husband emotionally charged watching this series, that we talked about this for weeks during and after we watched the whole series. Every actor delivered such a good performance.

I thought Damien Lewis was really excellent as Soames.  I had never seen him in anything before, and I thought he did an amazing job.  Despite his faults, he was able to also convey his humanity, and I ended up feeling sorry for him throughout most of the series.  When I started the second season, I didn't think I'd like it as much since it involved the next generation, but the last episode made up for that.

About Love,adultery,obsession unrequited love power and money..It is the story of 3 generations of Forsytes. This is the latest version. The first one came to TV in the late 60's and it was just as mesmerizing. This has been updated to include more delicious intrigue.",1452211200,,352,5.086206896551724
1797893,5,B00007149J,"Oh my. Who knew the late Victorians were so decadent -- ripping bodices, having adulterous affairs and children out of wedlock, in a series that gave birth to ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" catapulted Susan Hampshire to the first of three Emmy awards and revived Kenneth More's flagging career. But such is the quality of showrunner Donald Wilson and script staff's adaptation that this adaptation of John Galsworthy's novels that it never devolves into the mere soap opera of, say, ""Downton Abbey."" Here we have characters of depth, behaving in ways that are not always sympathetic but which keep one glued to the screen. Wilson & Co. also structure the episodes so that each one ends leaving us wanting more. It's a sad moment when the ultimate fade-out comes. True, some patience is advised for the back half of the saga, which is totally dominated by the character of Fleur (Hampshire) and is studded with longeurs that include subplots that don't go anywhere interesting and subsidiary characters of little purpose. Most of the richness lies in first half, filled to bursting with the older generations of Forsytes, whose loves and peccadilloes seem to pass all too swiftly.

As the central character, Soames Forsyte, the chiseled Eric Porter is watchable, complicated and -- if not sympathetic -- always understandable even at his most bestial. He is the firm spine that holds the series together. As another reviewer said, rightly,  ""Most compelling, compare Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene in 1969, with... well, there really is no comparison here."" It is the perfect meeting of actress and role. Hampshire holds the series' back end up as best she can but Fleur is simply not drawn with the depth of Soames, Irene and Young Jolyon (More). The supporting cast is large and mostly splendid (the two British actors attempting to play Americans from North Carolina fail miserably, though), especially Margaret Tyzack as Winifred, Soames' patient sister. Michael York even turns up briefly, as the ill-fated Jolly Forsyte.

Warner Bros. has done an outstanding job with the presentation, right down to the handsome packaging. Bonus features include deleted scenes, alternate takes, behind-the-scenes footage, 41 minutes of outtakes, cast interviews, two British talk shows devoted to the series' impact -- including one called ""Soames vs. Irene,"" plus cast biographies. A great deal of loving care was obviously taken to bring this to home video. Yes, the imagery is sometimes grainy, but we are talking about video tapes that are pushing 50 years old. This ""Forsyte Saga"" gripped me as the BBC color remake did not and I recommend it heartily.",1452124800,7,2635,5.109048723897912

It was a phenomenon in Britain: Soames and Irenes marriage was the subject of national debate, and local vicars were reportedly asked to change the times of services so their congregations could be home in time for Forsyte.

1797973,5,B00007149J,"The Forsyte family is an interesting study in human character, especially that character that depicts the Victorian Age and the evolution in society that evolved as technology was born and then increased.  While the story encompasses the lives and relationships of the whole family, it is interesting to note the indelible mark that the Soames/Irene relationship left on the entire clan over the 50-some-year span of the series.

While I don't feel that I can add much more to the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I thought that I would reply to some of the points various reviewers have made.  There were reviewers here at amazon that claimed they'd felt sorry for Soames.  From the snippets I'd seen previously, I'd doubted that I could ever feel sorry for him.  But like others here, I found myself doing the same thing as the series progressed from the episodes I'd seen before.

But unlike others have said, I thought the make-up dept had done a good job at aging the characters.  They could have hired older actors to play an older Jolyan (Soames' estranged cousin), Irene, Soames and his siblings but I think we would have lost that special sense of character that only that particular actor could bring to his portrayal.  It would have felt ""too strange"" - to me, anyway.  I'm not familiar with theatrical make up but it would seem to me that it would have been difficult to depict not only an aging face but an aging body without it becoming too cumbersome or too unrealistic.  Rather than use a lot of wrinkles to depict age, the skin appeared paler with age spots on some of the characters.  I also thought that the characters themselves, through inflection, gait and other nuances, depicted the aging process quite well.

I will say that the ending surprised me, but in a good way.  I felt that everything came ""full circle"", so to speak.  I enjoyed it and am glad that I purchased the DVD set so that I can view it again.  But before I do that, I want to read the book!",1439251200,5,2005,4.57703081232493

1797979,5,B00007149J,"As readers of these reviews can see, the characters in this series are so well-drawn and credible they force the emotional and moral engagement of most viewers. I decided to own this series because most of the important characters are each a careful, and very credible, mix of virtue and amorality.

My personal favorite is Irene. Misunderstood ""everywoman"" or sociopath? I come down on the side of sociopath if only for fear that she is very close to being ""everywoman."" Here and on IMDb, I have read endless feminist apologies for her choice to marry Soames that all come down to ""she had no real choice in the matter because the cards were so stacked against the women of her era."" Doubtlessly true, but nevertheless inadequate justification for agreeing to marry him, particularly since she had no apparent interest in EVER trying to soften him, meld with him, find peace in the relationship, etc. Others, including the young French woman, virtually leapt at the chance, and made a fine go of it, by the standards of the day. Add to this the blithe betrayal of her closest friend AND her husband (albeit in name only) and you have a character that appears to care little that she is leaving a very wide field of debris in her wake, particularly in a family that has shown her every courtesy, again by the standards of the day.

Another finely-drawn, multi-faceted character is Soames himself. The politically correct among us have him as the villain of the piece while others are more or less evenly split. I would say that, yes, he is not perfect by late 20th and early 21st century standards. In his own time, I suspect he was far above the norm. His is a cautionary tale about the consequences of marrying outside your circle where everyone agrees on the rules of conduct, and living as well as possible with the choices you are not always as free as one would wish to make. His passions and his decent into obsession are entirely believable to this ""Old Dog attempting to embrace New Tricks."" Men are passionate creatures (as are women) but, for the sake of others, a great many of us keep a lid on it. He was used as a meal ticket by an otherwise maladjusted woman and, yes, in a perfect world women would be able to get away with all such abuse... cleanly free of having to enjoy the consequences. Sad for a great many of both genders that things do not always turn out that way.",1438560000,13,2389,4.553488372093023

1797996,3,B00007149J,"Bought this 4 disc PBS issue of the modern remake because it was cheaper than the other (Acorn) set.  It has the usual PBS intros and each episode must be selected separately - there's no 'play all' option which Acorn dvds usually have.  Granada (ITV) produced this in two series: 8 episodes in 2002 and 5 in 2003 but PBS didn't release it until 2015.  It certainly lives up to the high standards of a British costume drama.  However, even though it's in black and white, I prefer the original, 26 episode version from the BBC in 1967 which was shown as the first PBS Masterpiece Theatre in 1969.",1437350400,23,596,4.440366972477064

Clearly it is NOT Downton Abbey, but if you enjoy the drama of the late 1800's and early 1900's in the UK, and the roles and social dances that people had to play, you may enjoy this very much. Having it on DVD is excellent, as the set design and costumes, as well as scenes are worth going back to and going over, as things move quickly in this drama, It has its funny, somber, and certainly dramatic moments, all involving the inter-relationships of the extended family and some friends. Certainly would recommend it as a slice of history and an interesting and intense story line.",1437004800,16,631,4.584070796460177

It was so well received in England and in Germany at the time, and I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for such a reasonable price.  The series was on the cutting edge of this type of a serialized production at the time.  The book by John Galsworthy is one of my favorites, and the series follows the book so well.  The ""poetic license"" used in the development of the story line did not distract from the overall narrative. Kudos for Amazon for offering such a great series, which is so well done.",1436486400,2,627,4.3247863247863245

Then when I realized how much I am enjoying it I decided it deserved 5. I only received it a few days ago and have already watched 6 of the 7 discs. I end up watching it way into the early hours of the morning because I can't seem to turn it off. Wonderful series with top notch acting.

I am so glad to have it in my own library now and share with my husband who never saw it and was watching the 2002 version which is absolutely dreadful.  However, I thought Corin Redgrave in the 2002 version as Old Jolyon was very good and reminded me of the tremendous performance by Joseph O'Connor in the original series.

1798043,5,B00007149J,"For me, the strengths of this version are in the subtle changes in the personalities that one can see in the main characters as the series progresses. Soames is a dark and forbidding character at the onset, but gradually transforms into something quite human by the end. The transformation of Irene and Jolyon are similarly revealing. Yes, many of the criticisms of the production are validit is almost 50 years oldbut the experience was definitely worthwhile for me. On another topic, there are, in fact, closed captions on these discs, but the DVD player must be set to output analog signals over composite, component or S-video connectors, and the television's CC setting must be ""on""; they will not work over HDMI or other digital-only cables.",1421712000,6,747,4.984

I liked it very much, but most of the reviewers seemed to prefer the earlier production, making me wonder what I was missing. After viewing all 26 episodes of this version, I have to strongly disagree. Although it was much more thorough and true to the original material, I found it slow and rather tedious. Eric Porter didn't make me feel any of the repressed passion and pain of the character Soames that his counterpart did. Damien Lewis' portrayal broke my heart. Yes I admit the 2002 production took some liberties with the plot, but I suspect it was done to make it more relatable to modern audiences. Also I felt that Porter and most of the cast were too old to ""play young"". The acting, especially by the some of the women, was laughable; theatrical and overwrought. The actress who played Anne Wilcox was supposed to be from the American south, but her accent sounded Australian to me. This is one time I greatly preferred the remake to the original.

I have watched four episodes already, really wanting to like it.  I find I just can't get past the absolutely terrible miscasting of Irene.  She is supposed to be a beautiful, irresistible, mysterious, charming femme fatale that all these men fall in love with.  I found her boring and not attractive or charming enough for this role.  To think that Damien Lewis, who I find very attractive, should be totally abhorred by this woman and that he should be madly in love with her is just too much of a stretch.  He does a great job in his role as a villain, but still can't imagine him being totally disgusting to this woman.  As much as I wanted to enjoy this great period piece, I have decided after four episodes to give up on it and get the earlier version which everyone raves about.

As for the sets and design, all was excellent!  I like the rest of the cast, too, but from what I have read am looking forward to watch the original version.",1402617600,3,1108,4.413793103448276

The miniseries has a stage-play quality, without the modern day seamless production aspects, so, it may seem dated to some.  However, I feel it is well worth the cost and time and gives prospective to the several TV remakes. There is some fine acting by Eric Porter and Susan Hampshire.

Trying on two different TV's and blu-ray/dvd combo's, I was unable to get closed captioning to turn on, it always said ""closed captioning unavailable"". On consulting the Vizio web site I found out why. This type of cc is analog, and modern TV's are all digital. So the cc on this disk would only play on an older TV-DVD that is analog. I contacted BBC again regarding this,pointing out that few video setups would be able to produce cc, and only in much older analog setups, and never heard back from them.

1798210,5,B00007149J,"This great BBC miniseries dramatizes the Forsyte novels and stories by Nobel Prize winner John Galworthy (The Man of Property, Indian Summer of a Forsyte, In Chancery, Awakening, To Let, The White Monkey, A Silent Wooing, The Silver Spoon, Passers By, Swan Song). All of these have been combined into a single book that is available as a free download from various sources (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forsyte-Saga-Complete/dp/B0084AHD30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forsyte Saga - Complete</a>).

The series is a period-piece drama that follows the lives the upper-middle-class Forsyte family in England during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The characters are diverse, complex, and realistic.

The series was shot in black & white and was initially shown in 26 episodes of 50 minutes each in 1967. The series starred stared Eric Porter as Soames, Kenneth More as Young Jolyon and Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene, (the always lovely and amazing) Susan Hampshire as Fleur, and Margaret Tyzack as Winifred. The series is more like a filmed stage play, so do not expect the flash and dazzle of a modern action-adventure movie.

I have also seen the newer Forsyte Saga miniseries from 2002 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forsyte-Saga-Collection/dp/B0083HXKMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forsyte Saga Collection</a>). It is good; however, it is not as complete as the 1967 series. Also, the casting and acting in the original (1967) series are remarkably better.

If you like thoughtful drama and period pieces, then you should enjoy this miniseries.",1346112000,11,1629,5.948717948717949
1798211,5,B00007149J,"A labour of love for writer/producer Donald Wilson, the BBC's sprawling 1967 miniseries of THE FORSYTE SAGA is still the benchmark upon which all the great costume dramas must be measured against.  Based on the legendary series of novels by John Galsworthy (""The Man of Property"", ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"", ""In Chancery"", ""Awakening"" and ""To Let""), the story follows three generations of the Forsyte family, whose lives are all forever changed by incidents surrounding key figures Soames, Irene and Young Jolyon.

The story begins in the late 1800's.  Trapped in a loveless marriage, watercolour painter Young Jolyon (Kenneth More) earns the ire of his family and must make his own fortune when he runs off with governess Helene Hilmer (Lana Morris).  This action forever splinters the Forsyte family and makes Young Jolyon even more of a ""black sheep"" than he was before.

On the other side of the family, Young Jolyon's cousin Soames (Eric Porter), a successful London solicitor, is intent on marrying the lovely Irene Heron (Nyree Dawn Porter).  Nudged on by her unscrupulous stepmother and repulsed by the lecherous advances of her prospective new stepfather, Irene makes no secret that she doesn't love Soames, but eventually accepts his proposal, on the condition that, if the marriage doesn't succeed, he'll let her be free.  This promise will haunt the pair for the rest of their lives.  Several years pass, in which time Irene hasn't learned to love her domineering, martinet husband.  Instead, she has fallen into an affair with architect Philip Bosinney (John Bennett) - the fianc of Young Jolyon's now-grown daughter June (June Barry).

Soames' sister Winifred (Margaret Tyzack) stumbles along in a shambolic marriage to Montague ""Monty"" Dartie (Terence Alexander), an alcoholic womaniser and wastrel who (apart from two children) brings her nothing but grief.  Long-separated from Irene and yearning to get married and start a family with the lovely young Annette (Dalia Penn), Soames pushes Irene to a divorce, only to find that she has fallen into the sympathetic arms of Young Jolyon.

Despite the deep feud surrounding Soames and Young Jolyon, the two sides of the Forsyte family stubbornly refuse to stay estranged, as evidenced when Young Jolyon's daughter Holly (Suzanne Neve) falls in love with Winifred's son Val (Jonathan Burn).  As the story moves into the 1920's, the spotlight shifts to the lives of Soames' now-grown daughter Fleur (Susan Hampshire), Irene's son Jon (Martin Jarvis) and their own stormy romance - made all the more painful and difficult in the wake of their parents' bitter past union.

Donald Wilson fought passionately for many years to secure the rights to THE FORSYTE SAGA, still owned at the time by MGM (who had created a film from the first novel entitled ""That Forsyte Woman"" in the 1940's but hadn't touched the property since).  Notably, THE FORSYTE SAGA was one of the final BBC series taped in B&W - Donald Wilson himself said he would have preferred the series in colour, but it must be said that the story does lend itself beautifully to the B&W palette, especially in the Victorian/Edwardian portions (where, amongst other events, real footage of the death of Queen Victoria was able to be seamlessly incorporated into the drama).  The photography also provides a haunting, ethereal quality to many scenes.  Donald Wilson worked with a small coterie of writers (Anthony Steven, Lawrie Craig, Vincent Tilsley, Constance Cox and Lennox Phillips), who together managed to reign together Galsworthy's labyrinthine maze of plots into a steady series of 26 fifty-minute episodes.

Picture and sound quality greatly varies in this DVD boxset but on the whole the quality is surprisingly good (although certain episodes look better than others).  The BBC took great care of the series and it appears that the original studio 'quad-tapes' were used in the remastering for this DVD collection.  There are several fascinating extras included on the last DVD, including some rare colour footage taken from the taping of the final episode; and some illuminating on-set interviews with Donald Wilson, costume supervisor Joan Ellacott and cast members Kenneth More, Nyree Dawn Porter, Eric Porter, Maggie Tyzack, Nicholas Pennell and Susan Hampshire.",1344729600,10,4298,5.201449275362319

What we select, what we reject, what defined moments represent inner truth, which of these bubbles in time define and shape us. Being an artist with intense visual and verbal recall, it amused me to be surprised that this compelling series imprinted itself in my memories as if it had been broadcast in color, watching this as a child. Aside from that, this 1967 masterpiece is exactly as excellent as I remembered, even if Irene's hair is not butter-yellow, but a light within the back and white spectrum (the re-mastered picture resolution is sharp). One dark, difficult Montana winter, I immersed myself in Galsworthy's epic, written between 1906 and 1921. Art and what it means to be true to self are well explored, as in the ennui of the 20th century. The BBC casting of the 1967 mega-hit depicts the characters true to Galsworthy's vision. Nyree Dawn Porter was a softly curved and gentle, and exquisite foil to the perfection of Eric Porter as Soames Forsyte's obsession. He reminds me of the 18th century's Barnabas Collins, whose grim resurrection in the 1960s was a rage in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-The-Beginning-Collection-1/dp/B000QGDJGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: The Beginning, Collection 1</a>&nbsp;-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Collection-26/dp/B000FS9FDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows Collection 26</a>&nbsp;(shades of darkness lost in the camp vampness of the recent Burton remake). Given that Soames is the backbone, the structure of the Forsyte Saga, I couldn't abide his miscasting in the 2002 version. Eric Porter will always be the true Soames, the hard slate upon which all the other characters dance around. The specials on the last disk are an absolute treat, taking viewers back to England in the 60s, as people debate the Saga as if the Forsyte clan were members of their own family. Which, in a sense, they were. Churches and pubs were emptied across the U.K., as audiences were utterly mesmerized by the story of a family moving from humble country roots to wealthy, upper-class status. Soames, upon visiting the rural graves and home sites of his ancestors, wonders what the Forsyte family lost in this process of London-based prosperity.

1798276,4,B00007149J,"Watching this series is truly a commitment of time and patience but it does pay off. In the honored tradition of BBC productions of the era, the sets are somewhat flimsy (walls shake when doors are slammed shut - you could make it a drinking game in some episodes). The costumes are well done but not entirely period correct - you know, the late 60s/early 70s hair along with a slight spin on the costumes (think more SF Opera one piece costumes rather than Dickens Faire period correct costumes). In early episodes - some of the actors seem to be rushing lines and it can be hard to pick up what they are saying - and there are no subtitles available for the hearing impaired.

But the rewards are great - you see the development of complex characters, you see Soames as truly unlikable at first and then changing as he grows older and learns from his life. You also see some of the actors improving their acting skills - and you get a rich story that is very true to the original story written by John Galsworthy. It's far more complex and engaging than the 2002-2003 miniseries - with some fantastic double entendres that are just left out of the new series entirely (in favor of batting people over the head with overt sexuality). Quite a masterpiece, indeed - add all to your queue and settle in for a rich and well executed production.",1316563200,7,1341,4.473469387755102
1798297,5,B00007149J,"The 1967 BBC version of ""The Forsyte Saga"" may have primitive, even laughable, production values compared with the 2002 remake. But in every other way, the original version is superior, by a wide margin. The 1967 version was a worldwide craze and began the proud tradition of British TV miniseries that gave us ""I, Claudius,"" ""Brideshead Revisited,"" ""Downton Abbey"" and so many others. The 2002 version, on the other hand, would have strangled the genre in its cradle, so dull and doughy it was.

It's a little much, I grant you, for modern audiences to see the stock footage of Queen Victoria's funeral, the General Strike, etc., interweaved with the stagebound black-and-white scenes with the actors. But all of the actors--most of whom would become extremely familiar through subsequent miniseries--are absolutely first-rate, Producer Donald Wilson and his team of writers created 26 episodes stuffed with sparkling dialogue and meticulously detailed plot, just as Galsworthy would have wanted it.

Of the performers in the newer version, the only one who came close to matching his counterpart in the original was Rupert Graves as Jo. (Kenneth More was great, but so is Graves.) As Soames and Irene, however, Eric Porter and Nyree Dawn Porter tap-danced all over Damian Lewis and Gina McKee, in rugby cleats. Both the Porters (no relation to each other, by either marriage or blood) were uniquely, magically right for the roles of Soames and Irene; their close-ups at the end of Episode 6, which is of course the crucial plot point of the entire series, are perhaps the greatest of any performers in the history of television. Both actors created enormous sympathy for characters who, to say the least, weren't always sympathetic; as played by Lewis and McKee, however, both Soames and Irene roundly deserved to be drop-kicked off the white cliffs of Dover.

The DVD collection for the 1967 version has a Special Features section that provides some fascinating footage of More, the Porters, Susan Hampshire, etc., being interviewed about their characters and rehearsing scenes. There are also some interesting vintage programs depicting the Forsyte craze that swept England in the late 1960s. In all, this is a brilliant DVD set, well worth having for anyone who loves vintage TV at its best.",1314489600,9,2296,5.101063829787234

It was on public television, and we didn't yet have cable, so I was unable to watch it then.

I never saw the original Forsyte Saga until it was released on DVD, and I can now say confidently that it was well worth the wait.

Since this is a production from the 1960s, all 26 episodes are black and white.  I expected this to make it seem somewhat old fashioned, but it wasn't at all.  The cast is so outstanding and the writing is so literate that one overlooks any thing which might seem a shortcoming.

Irene commits cold-blooded marriage to escape a difficult personal situation.  She loathes the man she marries and comes to loathe him more and more even though he showers her with gifts and does his best by her.  After three years, she commits adultery with the fianc of a cousin, wrecking her life.  When her husband finds out about it, his patience finally snaps and he forces her to have sex with him.  She immediately runs to her lover, sobbing and telling him what happened.  The news so unhinges him that he wanders the streets in a daze and is run over and killed.

Irene then endures several years of lower-middle-class existence, then begins seeing one of the older men in the Forsyte family she has married into.  With her demur, pretty and unattainable sweetness, she so rouses him that he has a heart attack and dies.  This leads to an acquaintance with her son and their eventual marriage.

Years later, when Irene's son falls in love with the daughter of her ex-husband, Irene does her hysterical, anguished dance once more, causing her husband to have a heart attack and die.  As a result, her son, against his own wishes and judgment, breaks off his engagement with the daughter of the ex-husband, condemning her to an unsatisfied life.

Final score: four men dead, two women's lives ruined, and Irene alone remains standing, untouched, serene, and pretty as ever.

This is a superb, 22-hour dramatization and will be cherished by everyone who likes period drama, tight screenwriting, accurate acting and a moving story.  A remake was done recently.  It has none of these qualities, and its London-hip actors wearing period clothes will appeal only to those unable to relate to any other period than their own.",1209772800,9,1999,4.818181818181818

1798362,5,B00007149J,"I was thrilled to have the chance to re-visit this series created by the BBC during my teenage years. The acting and costuming were every bit as memorable as I had remembered. It was also wonderful to see the leading lady, Nyree Dawn Porter, in this role again, as she is also a New Zealander by birth. The attention to detail was superb and my only regret is that it was not filmed in colour as it was just too early for that. However, I must add that after the first few minutes, that fact was inconsequential because of its brilliance.",1170720000,10,538,4.336633663366337
1798363,4,B00007149J,"This is showing its age a bit, as classic films do, but it is still an outstanding example of television drama, told in a measured but compelling way. The actors start out overage for their roles (Young Jolyon is referred to as being 32 and the actor Kenneth More was clearly decades older than that, ditto Eric Porter as Soames) but that is quickly forgotten beause of the fine acting. The black-and-white format probably serves the series well, because it was clearly filmed on a budget with small sets, and if in color would have looked more to be on the cheap. We are not distracted by the costumes and sets and even dated makeup, we just have to watch the story. Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene is excellent, you can believe in her transformation from naive and desperate girl facing poverty to, just a few years later, a suffocated and hardened, unhappy wife. In many ways this series is superior to the remake of 2002--Soames is more unrelentingly grim and clueless, as he should be. This older version is absolutely faithful to the plot in the novels. I did prefer the Jo of Rupert Graves in the remake, mostly because he seemed the right age. But regardless of how you feel about the remake, see this version for an example of the best of British televsion and an introduction to a fine series of novels.",1170547200,17,1308,4.546610169491525

1798387,5,B00007149J,"""The Forsyte Saga"" was one of the groundbreaking miniseries of public television, and what a series it was. Superb acting and character development abound, and it is difficult to say which was the more moving--Part I, set in the Victorian era, or Part II, which takes place in the 1920s. The narrative follows the lives of various members of an upper-middle-class British family, seeing them from their sedate, late nineteenth century affluence into an even more influential position in society, when Fleur, the daughter of Soames Forstye, marries into the aristocracy. Part I is narrated by ""Young Jolyon"" (wonderfully played by Kenneth More), the artistic black sheep of the Forsyte Family. Part II's narrator is Michael Mont, the buoyant, likeable young baronet with a social conscience, who becomes Fleur Forsyte's husband.

Eric Porter does a splendid job in his portrayal of Soames Forsyte, whom we first encounter as a coldly materialistic, possessive man obsessed with wealth, propriety, and his lovely wife Irene. For all of his chilly acquisitiveness, Soames does harbor a love of beauty in his innermost soul, and his wife's lack of affection for him is the one blight on his otherwise successful life. Irene, played by Nyree Dawn Porter, represents the ""eternal feminine,"" the muse, the corporeal and spiritual beauty for which so many seek, but few people find. The men who worship her--Soames, the young architect Philip Bosinney, Young Jolyon, and even Young Jolyon's elderly father--do so as much for her indescribable charm and  mysterious allure as for her physical appeal. By the end of Part I, Irene has abandoned her role as Soames' trophy wife and, after one tragic love affair, finds happiness with the middle-aged, widowed ""Young Jolyon.""

The series then takes us into the lives of Soames' daughter by his second marriage, the restless, willful Fleur (winsomely played by Susan Hampshire), and the innocent, idealistic Jon, Irene's son by Young Jolyon. Soames, who remains a major character, is still tied to his notions of property and propriety, but age and fatherhood have mellowed him, and he is a far more likeable individual than he was in the earlier episodes. The end of Part II witnesses the consummation of Fleur and Jon's forbidden love--kept apart by the old story of Soames' and Irene's unhappy marriage, Fleur has married Michael Mont and John has married Anne Wilmot, a pretty American girl. By this time, Soames has evolved into, perhaps, the most sympathetic character in the story, and we have come to feel affection for him, and a grudging respect.

Filmed in black and white and originally broadcast in the 1960s, this remarkable made-for-television drama is still riveting, and a truly fine, accurate adaptation of John Galsworthy's Forsyte novels. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1167955200,15,2831,5.1612200435729845
1798388,5,B00007149J,"I was too young to see the Forsyte Saga when it was originally broadcast in the 1960s, but I did see it in the 70s when it was hailed as the godfather of the various BBC period adaptations.  Watching it is one of the most delightful experiences as the BBC has done a great job in capturing Galsworthy's unforgettable characters.  Soames, Fleur, Irene, all the Jolyons, the aunts, uncles and their associated friends and enemies.

There have been two other attempts to bring Galsworthy to either movies or TV. The first was MGMs ""That Forsyte Woman"" which omits to mention that Soames (horribly cast Errol Flynn) raped Irene there in setting things into motion. There is also the more modern version shown on Masterpiece Theatre.  While this probably was more explicit than the 1950s theatrical version, it suffered from excess of production values.  The Forsytes seemed rather richer than the royal family and there seemed to be more of an excess of marble and gilt than the parsimonious Forsytes would have approved of.

In this version from the 1960s, it is as it should be and I think the fact that it is in black and white takes nothing away from the outstanding performances, most notably by Kenneth Moore, Eric Porter and the always wonderful Susan Hampshire (is there any other actress who could possibly do justice to Fleur?).

This version is wonderful for other reasons, most notably the special features which capture just what a ground breaking series Forsyte Saga was when it first came out. I think it is safe to say that it still is and probably always will be.",1153612800,12,1576,4.750915750915751
1798389,5,B00007149J,"It was with great reluctance that I watched the recent version of the Forsyte Saga, as I knew the 60's version would be almost impossible to top.
And I was right. Why those who choose to write scripts from famous works that many people know of by heart, then alter story line and characterizations is a puzzle to me.
Fortunately, the the original version did not suffer from this, but instead respected Galsworthy's original works, as attested to by the books many of us have read.
The key to the story of the Forsyte Saga is Irene Heron, played so memorably by New Zealand born actress Nyree Dawn Porter.
Irene is an an artist, trapped in a life with a mother of questionable morals and little money to support herself.
She agrees to marry the stolid Soames Forsyte after his persistent attention to her.
Soames is a partner in the family law firm and cannot understand Irene's different temperament and ideals.
He buys paintings as investments, she abhors his mercenary manner, as she could sit and look at a painting in a gallery for hours on end, glorifying, immersed in it's poignancy and beauty.
But it's Irene, beautiful, strong, idealistic, who is the woman that is the object of obsessive love from her husband Soames who as the Man of Property, regards his wife as his own property, bought and paid for.
Then architect Phillip Bosinney, hired by Soames to design and build a house in the country (Robin Hill) meets and falls inlove with Soames wife, recognising in Irene a like mind, a soul mate.
Tragically Bosinney is killed in the London fog, and Irene leaves Soames to live in France.
Later when in England, Irene decides to see Robin Hill and it is there that she meets old Jolyon Forsyte who is the owner of this beautiful house.
Like Soames and Bosinney before him, the old gentleman is bewitched by Irene's beauty,and kindness, leaving her a substantial sum of money in his will to ensure she need never have to suffer deprivation again.
His son Young Jolyon - an alias referred to by the aging Forsytes as ""the black sheep"" - meets Irene in Paris to give her the first payment as stipulated in Old Jolyon's will, and an attraction is obvious.
I outline these matters to illustrate how central a figure the character of Irene is to this Saga, and how it all becomes believable because of the fine portrayal of Irene by Nyree Dawn Porter.
Eric Porter as Soames was magnificent, the stiff formality of his generation, the longing to be loved, the inability to understand his free spirit of a wife, the grief at losing her,the unforgettable rape scene,the aging of his character Soames, his great love for his daughter Fleur, (brought wonderfully and realistically to life by Susan Hampshire) even his final moment when he sacrifices his life for his wayward daughter, is all depicted magnificently by Eric Porter.
And finally to my personal favourite, the great Kenneth Moore who gave Young Jolyon the compassion and wisdom he so needed as he navigated his way through a disastrous first marriage, estrangement from Old Jolyon and his daughter June, the scandal when he marries his children's governess, and finally when he falls inlove with Soames estranged wife, Irene.
It is Moore's voice used in the narration, which is done to great effect.
The series was - in line with the sixties - made in black and white. The sets are a little on the crude side (doors that stick,
poor lighting in some scenes, and a butler who acts in the mode of a cardboard cutout !)
But for all this, the Forsyte Saga shines. It was the first big tele-series period/drama, and it was a benchmark for all the great series that followed it. It's a privelege to (finally) have it in my safe keeping on DVD. Thankyou BBC.",1143244800,19,3713,4.670229007633588
1798390,5,B00007149J,"Now available on 7 DVDs, comprising all 26 episodes plus several hours of additional features, this most celebrated and splendid of BBC TV serials was the brainchild of adapter and producer Donald Wilson.  Its world-wide success is known to all, but some might not be aware of the following: -

Donald Wilson was denied funds to produce it for ten years.  Had there been a delay of a further year the series would have been filmed in colour, as he wished, rather than black and white.

The first of the John Galsworthy novels on which the series is based contains almost no dialogue.  BBC script writers supplied the dialogue that helped make the ten siblings in the eldest Forsyte generation so memorable.

Galsworthy intended the Forsytes to represent the rapaciousness, greed and snobbery of the English upper middle class.  In this adaptation they are much more endearing.

Being filmed in black and white made it possible to interpolate archival film of Queen Victoria's funeral procession and of combat scenes from WW1.

Joseph O'Conor who plays the part of Old Jolyon was two years younger than Kenneth More who plays his son.

Eric Porter and Margaret Tyzack, who play Soames Forsyte and his sister Winifred, are in each episode and are required to age almost 50 years.

Although never credited, the music that opens and closes each episode is the first movement, ""Halcyon Days"", from the suite ""The Three Elizabeths"" written in the early 1940s by Eric Coates.",1132012800,121,1468,4.902834008097166
1798391,3,B00007149J,"The series is excellent but the handling by Amazon not so satisfying.

I can't get the subtitles on.

It was sent to me from the US not UK where I am registred.

It was an upleasant surprise for that I thus had to pay customs because it came from outside the EU.",1127088000,10,262,4.0
1798392,5,B00007149J,"I checked out this 1967 television production of ""The Forsyte Saga: First Generation"" in between the two parts of the 2002-2003 mini-series, having never read the three novels and two short stories that make up John Galsworthy's epic. Both divide the saga the same way, with ""The Man of Property"" (1906), the short story interlude ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"" (1918), and the novel ""In Chancery"" (1920) comprising the First Generation and another interlude, ""Awakening"" (1920) and the novel ""To Let"" (1921) making up the Second Generation.

It is impossible not to look at the relative strengths of each production, both of which are well worth the watching. The main one for me is that I get a much better sense of Jolyon Forsyte (Kenneth More) being one of the main characters in this version, along with Soames Forsyte (Eric Porter), than I did in the recent version. This is helped by the fact that ""Young"" Jolyon function as the narrator for the story. In terms of Soames I thought that Porter (who I recognized form one of my favorite B-monster movies, ""The Lost Continent"") had the hardness but not the buried heart that made Damian Lewis's performance in the final scene of the 2002 production so effective (as is Errol Flynn's understated performance as Soames in ""That Forsyte Woman""). Then there is Irene Forsyte n&eacute;e Heron, the woman who is loved by each of the Forsytes, and my clear preference is for Nyree Dawn Porter in this version, because there is more of a sense of this woman being able to go on her own when dictated by the situation.

Overall there is clearly a sense of all of the characters in this dysfunctional family from the modern version. The problem is not that there are so many characters to juggle but rather than there are few opportunities for many of them to be established in our minds. For me the most compelling character was Old Jolyon Forsyte (Joseph O'Conor), who eventually decides that family is more important than propriety. All of the elements of his story are here, but they just seem sketched to be rather than fully developed. The same can be said for Irene's affair with Phillip Bosinney (John Bennett), the intended fianc&eacute; of young June Forsyte (June Barry). The whole motivation and rational for that is suggested rather than revealed.

In the second part of the saga the Victorian age has come to an end and now the family conflict is passed on to a new generation, represented by Soames's daughter Fleur (Susan Hampshire) and Jon Forsyte (Martin Jarvis), son of Irene and Jo. Unaware of the family feud the two youngsters meet and fall in love, but it is only a matter of time until the truth comes out and all hell breaks loose. The other principle character is Michael Mont (Nicholas Pennell), who is fated to love Fleur more than she will ever love him. However, even with his daughter taking the central part in the drama, the story keeps coming back to Soames and we wonder what when all is said and done is finally going to be the death blow for the old man. When the end comes it is something of a surprising, but certainly a fitting climax. As Michael says towards the end, ""It's pretty hard sometimes to remember that it is all comedy.""

The soap opera elements, which include a case for libel, are balanced by a sense of the changing society, which moves beyond the Edwardian age to that of the post-World War I era. Michael Mont becomes the spokesperson for the concerns of the times, probably because he is not a Forsyte, and in that regard he becomes the counterpart of Young Jo for the second-generation characters. But in the end it is Soames who defines his family, both its strengths and weaknesses, and the second half of the saga resonates with our memory of how the first half ended. Soames Forsyte was a man of property, but the term was clearly one of evolving meaning. Ultimately, this production is one of those marvelous marriages of actors and characters, graced with a script that does a superb job of adapting a series of novels and two short stories by John Galsworthy that is rather sparse on actual dialogue in the initial works (this second half is essentially the 1921 novel ""To Let""). Even in black & white it remains something to be equaled, but not surpassed.

One benefit of this historical production, which led directly to the birth of ""Masterpiece Theater"" on PBS as a way of showing this series to American television audiences, being filed in black & white is that there are able to include actual film of the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. Ultimately, I am not bothered by either the black & white photography or the soap opera type sets. The limitations of this production are in the adaptation of Galsworthy's story by Lennox Philips and Donald Wilson, which gives us a sense of the breadth but not the depth of this narrative. However, this does not detract from the importance of this series in television history. Whatever its shortcomings this was the ""mini-series"" that opened the door for scores of noteworthy BBC programs.

You definitely want to catch this landmark 1967 television series on DVD because of the supplemental material. Surprisingly you will find a couple of deleted scenes and a whole series of outtakes; the latter are not of the comic variety, but more a collection of the technical problems reflecting state of the art television production at the time (it took 15 minutes to splice together two bits of video tape so they went to great lengths to avoid having to do so). Even more fascinating are the public debates over the mini-series, including a very passionate debate over the issue of who was the injured party in the Soames-Irene question and the infamous scene in which he ""reasserted his marital rights."" Any illusion you had of ""The Forsyte Saga"" being high brow (i.e., ""Masterpiece Theater"") is quickly dispelled as ordinary folk in the street reduce the entire affair to something on the level of ""All My Children"" but with the obsession of the level of ""Who Shot J.R.?""",1114560000,25,6028,4.730732635585157

Galsworthy's Saga was brilliantly adapted for the BBC in 1969,and no series has since matched it's achievement. All of the grandeur and pathos of the books is superbly expressed in this adaptation. The characters come vividly alive on the screen,and the era through which they pass is shown with all of it's faults and virtues. The acting is first rate, and all of the actors,from lead roles to small parts,are cast to perfection.
Kenneth More as Young Jolyon,Eric Porter as Soames,Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene,and Susan Hampshire as Fleur all give inspired performances,deep emotional characterizations that will move you greatly. In my opinion,they BECAME these characters. In addition,Margaret Tyzack as Winifred,Nicholas Pennell as Michael,Dalia Penn as Annette,and Caroline Blakiston as Marjorie Farrar give outstanding performances.

1798395,5,B00007149J,"Many reviewers have amply praised this landmark series and noted quite rightly that it is far superior to the new version recently shown on PBS.  What I found most memorable about The Forsyte Saga was Soames Forysyte, The Man of Property.  We begin with Soames, wonderfully played by Eric Porter, as a young man in search of a wife and the series ends with him being cared for by his daughter Fleur, the excellent Susan Hampshire.
Soames is villified and reproached by everyone because he is a tight fisted, hard, unyielding man who judges everything by its monetary value.  He wants a wife in order to get for himself an heir to his considerable property.  Love is not part of the equation for Soames.  An obedient, thrifty, proper woman will serve him well.  Unfortunatley for him, he falls in love with the beautiful Irene Herron, well played, for the most part, by Nyree Dawn Porter.  Irene is a young pianist who needs to find a home for herself.  She does not love Soames and tells him so, but this does not matter to Soames.  He will acquire her as he does a beautiful painting and hope that in time she will at least develop some affection for him.
At first Irene tolerates Soames, but soon she comes to despise him because his soul is a mercantile product housed in a cash box for a body.  Soames finds it unbelievable that his new wife does not value security and wealth.  This is bad, but worse comes when she falls in love with the architect Soames commissions to build a house for her.  The architect dies in a tragic accident and Irene leaves Soames to live on her own,  if not in poverty, in seriously straightened circumstances.
This conflict of Soames and Irene is at the heart of the entire series.  All of the Forsyte clan, and there are many members of this Victorian family, are touched in some way or another by the marriage and later divorce of Soames and Irene.  The greatness of this series is that we are able to follow the ongoing dispute as both Soames and Irene grow old.  Irene remains true to her artistic vision of herself, but Soames mellows somewhat because of his genuine love for his daughter.  In the end we come to have some modest respect and understanding for the old man. He is as much a 21st Century American Man of Property as a Victorian gentleman.
For those viewers who fall in love with this series, I can recommend even more highly the books on which they are based by John Galsworthy.  The Man of Property starts the series of well written, wonderfully entertaining novels.  The books and DVDs of the Forsyte Saga are an excellent addition to any home library.",1068940800,38,2608,4.522388059701493
1798425,5,B00007149J,"I got this DVD set after first reading the book, then seeing the second version on PBS.
While I love the 2002 production (and am one of those who admired Gina McKee as Irene) I admit to favoring this version. Mainly because of the length, which allows the viewer to see more of the growing love between Jolyon and Irene. (I'm still annoyed that the 2002 production only has TWO scenes Jo and Irene together after they fell in love!)
On top of that, I have to say that the performance of Susan Hampshire as Fleur was an admirable move on the part of an excellent actress. She could have portrayed Fleur as an innocent victim, torn from her true love. Instead, she portrayed the character as written, warts and all.
I admit, I've never understood why so many people see Jon and Fleur as star-crossed lovers, unless it is simply dislike for Irene. Fleur was a possessive, spoiled girl with much of her father in her. And like her father, she was determined to obtain and own the person she wanted, no matter the price. She lied to and manipulated family members. Her first reaction upon hearing of the death of Jon's father is not to comfort the man she supposedly loves, but to manipulate the situation to her own ends.
Anyway. While this version is perhaps too dated (with the 1960's hairstyles and makeup); and it sometimes feels like the characters are lecturing to the audience, it is a wonderful show.",1062374400,8,1404,4.553359683794467
1798426,5,B00007149J,"If you love BBC productions, settle back and enjoy this one.  It is SO much better than the 2002 production!  Unlike Damian Lewis, Eric Porter as Soames manages to be very disagreeable without being absolutely hateful.  Nyree Dawn Porter (no relation to Eric Porter) is perfect as Irene; she's beautiful and graceful both inside and out whereas Gina McKee's Irene (in the newer production) is awkward.  This original production also covers a lot more ground than the newer one-it is based on the entire three-book series that John Galsworthy wrote about the Forsyte family; the 2002 production covers only the first book in the series.
While Soames and Irene (pronounced ""Irenee"") are the main characters, the saga follows three generations of the Forsyte family, a wealthy non-aristocratic family in London, beginning in the latter half of the 19th century through World War I.  Many of the other characters are also unforgettable, particularly Kenneth Moore as Jo Forsyte and Susan Hampshire as Soames' daughter Fleur.
It is a masterful production of Galsworthy's portrait of the changing social mores in England's wealthy upper class over a 50-or-so-year period.  The costumes, staging and casting are flawless.
Be sure to watch the special features including interviews behind the scenes and especially ""The Forsyte Phenomenon"".  When this series was originally aired in the UK in 1967, it took the country by storm.  These special features give you a real feel for what it was like by way of original footage of interviews with the ""average man in the street"" and talk shows.  I never saw the original series back then, but I read Galsworthy's books about five years ago and have been looking for the videos/DVDs ever since.  It's been worth the wait!",1059436800,17,1756,5.065972222222222
1798427,5,B00007149J,"I bought the DVD set even though I already owned the series on tape.  The extra footage seemed just too tempting ! I wasn't disappointed, not only is this an excellent transfer, it's a small miracle they have been able to dig up 2 hours of extra footage ! Each and every minute of it is worth watching, from the wonderful cast interviews to the Late Night Line-up program that so well documents the ""Forsyte-madness"" that struck millions and millions of Brits back in 1967. Only one word of criticism : Warner didn't do their homework when it came to write the cast's biographies. There are mistakes and omissions all over the place, i.e. Eric Porter is credited with work he never had anything to do with [an animated film by an Australian of the same name] and Nyree Dawn Porter is said to have ""earned"" an OBE [Officer of the British Empire] when it is wellknown that she got it because of a mistake made in Downing Street.  The honour was to go to Eric Porter for services to television and the theatre [he was a founding member of the Royal Shakespeare Company] but went to Nyree instead because someone in the Prime Minister's Office got the 2 names mixed up. Let this not deter you, it's still a ***** set !!",1051574400,21,1215,4.443946188340807
1798428,5,B00007149J,"This original adaptation towers over the latest interpretation which seems to have been tailor-made for a disposable and fast-paced audience who are probably more result driven than interested in detail.
Having been a great fan of the book for many years, it was a pleasure to discover this BBC adaptation which has more to do with a visit to the theatre than it does an attendance at the movie cinema. In every respect the adpatation is pure BBC who are the undisputed masters of classic and contemporary television adaptation.
Being a much longer series, the BBC had greater opportunity to develop the characters which is essentially what Galsworthy's motivation for writing the book was right from the start - a character study of a self-made Victorian England upper-middle class family whose trials and tribulations are an analogue for the struggles of the (then) mature British Empire.
The struggle between the old Forsytes and the divergent paths followed by their offspring mirror those of England as it attempts to deal with the demands and aspirations of its dominions within the commonwealth.
In these respects this adaptation is faithful to the book and adds a dimension to the viewing completely lacking from that of the most recent adaptation.
The cast is a veritable ""A-list"" of British stage and screen, a pedigree which I feel is truly lacking from the latest adaptation. The acting is masterful for the fact that it is very human to watch and the way that each actor deals with the few hiccups experienced with props and sets only adds to that ""human-ness.""
This is the sort of production that has made the BBC world-famous and is worth every penny and minute of your time and effort.",1051488000,9,1701,4.909722222222222
1798429,5,B00007149J,"As a fan of the novels and as having vaguely remembered seeing a repeat of the BBC series as a child I was pleasantly surprised to see (upon viewing this DVD) just how fine a productions this actually was.  True, one has to look past the technical problems that come with filming for television in the late sixties (cramped sets, limited takes, sound problems, etc.) and the unfortunate casting in the character of Phillip Bosinney (he really didn't seem attractive in ANY way, which makes it more difficult to believe Irene's loving him), BUT if one does get past all that there is an incredible story full of moving and flawed characters.  The casting is as nearly perfect (with the exception of Bosinney) as any I've seen in any adaptation anywhere.  Truly remarkable.  The two most crucial casting decisions are those of two Porters (unrelated):  Rigid, ""long-headed"", and possessive Soames (Eric Porter) and Beauty personified in Irene (Nyree Dawn Porter).  The BBC nailed it.  The series is about property, owning it, maintaining it and keeping it--Irene is the ultimate possession and must have been extremely difficult to cast.  I am glad they took the time to get it right.
The story loses focus and interest after Jon decides not to marry Fleur (right after his father dies) but the first 12 or so episodes are worth buying the whole series.  Absolutely marvelous.",1049068800,14,1374,4.887931034482759
1798430,5,B00007149J,"I am happy beyond belief that this series has finally been
issued for the general public. I am enjoying it so very much,
it is just as if some thirty plus years had not already elapsed
since its release in the late 60's. This series stands the test
of time, over and over again.  This is a must see.",1048204800,2,299,4.067796610169491
1798431,5,B00007149J,"Possibly the greatest TV miniseries of all time, it is wonderful that it has been released with great care and pride in this marvelous DVD set.
What sets this particular adaptation apart from others, especially the recent (2002) version, is the outstanding ensemble acting and rich characterizations.  For example, as Soames, compare Eric Porter's crisp, impeccable diction in this version with Damian Lewis's mushy delivery in the 2002 version.  Compare the delightful, comic realization of James (Soames's father), played by John Welsh in 1969, with the indistinguishable-from-all-the-other-Forsytes character in 2002.  Most compelling, compare Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene in 1969, with...  well, there really is no comparison here.
Of course, visually, this version suffers compared to last year's. It's shot in black and white, mostly on stage sets.  Clearly, they used very few takes (another tribute to the actors), as minor defects like coats falling off racks, cameras getting bumped, slightly muffed lines are retained.  But, really, who cares when you're watching the finest combination of acting and screenwriting ever put on TV?
This DVD not only contains the entire set of 26 fifty-minute episodes, but also additional material: cast interviews, behind-the-scenes, even deleted scenes and outtakes.  Altogether, a beautiful job.",1047600000,293,1340,5.63681592039801
1798432,5,B00007149J,"I have a rare edition of Galsworthy's FORSYTE SAGA which over many many years I have gone back to read and read again each time discovering more and more.  How I love this book.
I first saw the PBS series THE FORSYTE SAGA, 1969, on television. I was riveted and totally smitten by this adaptation of Galsworhy's novel.  I felt it did great justice to a complex book.  I still get the warmies thinking about it.
I just recently viewed the PBS abbreviated version and while I found myself wishing that it were as the original series was, except in colour, there can be no comparison.  None whatsoever.
Good. Very good. But not excellent.  The first time around it was nothing short.
My only other love, which I now see is available finally, is BRIDESHEAD REVISITED with Jeremy Irons et al.
How lucky can I get than to be able to put these two classics into my library of classics.  Oh my!",1047513600,,886,4.438271604938271
1798433,5,B00007149J,"I wasn't a fan when it played in the 60s, and recalled only Kenneth More and Susan Hampshire, but I bought this set before it was published on the basis of the reviews I read here.  It was a lost weekend, but we finished the set.  What an enjoyable series, even though it's black and white, no wide screen, with the inevitable shaking walls when the door slams.  Remember, this was a TV show, like Playhouse 90.  But the acting is superb, especially that of Eric Porter, Nyree Dawn Porter (how lovely! how graceful!) and Susan Hampshire.  I loved the special features on the last disc.  I had forgotten what a phenomenon it had been.  It was the progenitor of Masterpiece Theatre, such was the demand.  Go ahead and buy it.  I'm not lending out!",1047513600,5,745,4.45925925925926
1798434,5,B00007149J,"In the early years of the last century, John Galsworthy wrote nine novels, divided into three trilogies. ""The Man of Property,"" ""In Chancery"" and ""To Let"" formed the first trilogy, which he called ""The Forsyte Saga."" The second group, ""The White Monkey,"" ""The Silver Swan"" and ""Swan Song"" formed ""A Modern Comedy."" Finally ""Maid in Waiting,"" ""Flowering Wilderness"" and ""One More River"" made up the last group called ""End of the Chapter.""
 The first three books concentrated on the property-driven first generation Forsyte men, whose world was broken up by a beautiful woman called Irene, ""a concretion of disturbing Beauty impinging on a possessive world,"" as Galsworthy puts it in his preface. But it is also a saga that brings us from the Victorian world in the 1880s up to the 1920s when the new generation finds new values.

 Now this is very difficult stuff to reduce to a miniseries, but that is what BBC did quite successfully back in the 1960s and the television audience on both sides of the Atlanic went wild. For half a year, given a 50-minute episode each week for 26 weeks, they sat fascinated as they watched the fortunes of the Forsytes, man and woman, grasping, losing, growing older, having children who suffered from what their parents had done, some finding happiness at last, some settling for second best, but all interesting and very human. It is said that the idea of British miniseries based on famous novels is what prompted PBS to create Masterpiece Theatre to satisfy the demand. (Coincidentally, at the time of this writing, the very first Masterpiece Theatre, ""The First Churchills,"" is due to come out on DVD from Acorn Media!)
 I am sure many of you have watched the first third of the new version of ""The Forsyte Saga"" complete with color, the obligatory scenes in bed, and horse manure carefully piled up in the streets of London. Be advised that the 1967 version is a studio version, with several location shots, in glorious black and white, with a cast that is simply hard to beat or even match, and a tendency to be wonderfully addictive.
 I have viewed the DVD version on 7 discs released by Warner Home Video on the BBC label. (Yes, that is 1300 minutes in all, followed by 2 hours of spellbinding, often extremely funny,  ""bonus"" material on the 7th disc.) If you prefer video tapes, the series comes in two sets: The First Generation on 6 tapes, The Second Generation on 7 tapes. They do not contain any of the extra material, so be advised.
Technically, the picture has been beautifully restored except for a second here and there when there is a slight blur, perhaps 10 seconds worth out of more than 21 hours hours, and now and then the sound does get a bit fuzzy. In fact, I remember that being true when this series was first telecast, so that is no fault of this restoration.
 The major stars are Eric Porter (Soames Forstye), Nyree Dawn Porter (Irene), Kenneth Moore (young Jolyon Forsyte), and a pretty actress who made her reputation in this series, Susan Hampshire. I cannot begin to list the rest, all of which you can catch during the end titles and much of which you can find on the Internet Movie Data Base. Porter plays to perfection the ""unlovable"" man who cannot understand why he is so; and as the story unfolds, his partial mellowing, as played by Porter, is an example to all ""modern"" actors.
 In the book, Irene is seen only through the consciousness of the other characters, and as good as Ms. Porter looks as Irene, her acting is a touch wooden for such a catalytic character. Still she looks far more striking than her counterpart in the 2002 version.
 Galsworthy has been compared with Thackery, but he does not quite have the sweep of that earlier author. Still, the scene at a party after a lawsuit in which the loser is attracting all the attention while the winners are being cold-shouldered by their so-called friends is both painful and telling. (In fact, if it makes you think of ""Chicago,"" you can see how far ahead Galsworthy was in his estimation of how we treat ""morality."")
 Of course this is high class soap opera, but the production values are quite good for a 1967 studio production, the acting superb, and the dialogue a bit more intelligent than you will find in the afternoon on commercial series. This set, on tapes or DVDs, is a real ""grabbit."" It afforded me nearly 22 hours of viewing pleasure and will do the same for you.",1047513600,11,4410,4.664092664092664
