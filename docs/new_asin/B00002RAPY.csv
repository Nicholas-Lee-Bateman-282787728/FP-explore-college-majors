8588126,1,B00002RAPY,"I bought this movie because I am a huge fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh, and that was the only reason I bought it. The DVD is cheaply done it self a both movies suck. I know what you're thinking, its probably so bad its funny. NO, its not. I almost died of boredom. The action scenes were soooo poorly done and the acting (what acting?) looks like they're reading off of cue cards! Only buy this movie if you're a die-hard fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh.",976406400,2,447,4.209302325581396
