8295404,3,B001DXS4BA,"During the scene at the bed & breakfast where they were about to have the discussion about whether to move on or stay, a part of that scene repeated itself. This was almost the end when the realtor was showing the bed & breakfast.  I thought that this was a mistake and it will pickup where it left off after the second take. It did not.  I never saw the actual part of that scene.  It was like groundhog day except I did not ever get to see what would have happened.  Bummer!!",1304121600,,477,4.096774193548387
8295405,5,B001DXS4BA,"Very funny and loving family, love watching them.  Highly recommend to you.  I find both of them are very family oriented and carring with each other.",1304121600,,150,4.730769230769231
8295406,5,B001DXS4BA,"I live in Sweden and most of the reality series hasn't been aired yet so I Bought them from Amazon. I love the drama, the everyday troubles and that being a celebrity doesnt free you from all the issues with life all the rest of us are working with. Love this, looking forward to the next.",1301011200,,289,4.178571428571429
8295407,5,B001DXS4BA,They are a great couple and they make me laugh! I was pregnant around the same time as Tori which got me attached to her and shows... I just hope all other seasons will come out.,1289433600,,178,3.9722222222222223
8295408,2,B001DXS4BA,I was very disappointed to find a technical malfunction when I reached the last epiosode on the second disc. About 3 minutes of footage is repeated directly after being shown and in turn approx 3 mins of footage is missing from the episode leaving a hole in the plot. At first I thought I had accidentally hit the rewind button but sure enough it's a manufacturing error.,1251676800,3,371,4.552238805970149
8295409,5,B001DXS4BA,"I am a huge Tori and Dean fan and have followed them in the tabloids and now on Oxygen.  After watching Season 1, I couldn't wait to view season 2, and it did not disappoint.  As always Dean is a heartthrob and Tori, glamorous and hysterical!  Nine 30-minute episodes makes this easy to watch for a short clip or more.",1239062400,6,318,4.266666666666667
