8218415,5,B000VEA3GG,"I liked this movie enough to let my daughter watch it over and over. My daughter is 4. We rented it from Netflix and I almost couldn't return it because she loves the movie so much. I like how each troll has their own personality and the songs were really kinda cute and catchy. This is a great movie for any family with girls. She also likes the first Trollz movie, ""Friend for Life"" but said it was a bit scary. She watches Scooby Doo all the time and she's not scared by most of them.",1227744000,3,487,4.083333333333333
