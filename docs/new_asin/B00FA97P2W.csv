5972833,5,B00FA97P2W,"finally the correct price for a bleach dvd set.

weve all been complaining and finally the price has dropped.

there are rumors that its due to viz finally making the bleach series go to blu ray , i can only hope",1388448000,,212,4.146341463414634
5972834,5,B00FA97P2W,"Finally, into the battles. Of course only 2 disc so you can not see all the battles and the outcomes. Got to wait till next DVD comes out. But at least not going into the past too much and see other shows that have nothing to do with the fighting.",1388016000,,247,3.96
5972835,4,B00FA97P2W,"Great episodes, just wish there wasn't so much repeat at the start of each one.  It took forever to return to the main story arch, and then they only give us two disks worth of material, which if it wasn't for the cheaper price would be considered abusive.  I don't know if its their production schedule, finances, or plain stupidity, but there has to be a better way to package these story arcs.",1387756800,,396,4.410958904109589
5972836,5,B00FA97P2W,"I bought this box set because I collect Anime & I already have the previous box sets of Bleach. This box set was much better than the previous one, it had lots of intense battles with the Espadas. The story with Aizen's plan is further along. One of my favorite battles was when Ichigo was fighting against Ulquiorra in his fully Hollified state.",1387238400,,346,4.507936507936508
5972837,5,B00FA97P2W,The set is priced cheaper than all the rest at $17 dollars compared to $29.99 it seems they heard our complaints and have dumb down the price and this comes from someone who owns all the sets to the current one don't miss out.,1384214400,10,226,4.159090909090909
5972838,5,B00FA97P2W,Great anime series right in the middle of some of its best battles. Combined with a preorder price of only $18 for a dozen episodes. Putting it at just a $1.50 an episode. No self respecting anime fan should pass up this deal.,1384214400,6,226,4.27906976744186

5972852,5,B00FA97P2W,On my way to a complete collection of Bleach. These are pretty good episodes - the culminating battle with Ulquiorra (SIC) - I guess if I am such a fan I should learn how to spell their names - I know how to spell the names of all the female characters if you know what I am saying. And the final transformation of Yammi. The bad guys are always what makes any animation all the more interesting and the Espadas are some of the coolest bad guys that have ever been created for anime in my opinion. Awesome.,1451779200,,506,4.173469387755102

5972879,5,B00FA97P2W,"I love Bleach! I'm busy all the time so this is a great way to catch up on the series slowly as they release the English dubbed versions.

5972880,5,B00FA97P2W,"This one picks up right back at the main story - I skipped the previous two sets, which you can do without really missing out.  The action sequences in these episodes were great - just what devoted Bleach fans enjoy!",1396137600,,216,4.4
5972881,5,B00FA97P2W,it came on the day that it said it was going to. and it is exactly as it was advertised,1395187200,,87,3.4
5972882,5,B00FA97P2W,"the bleach series has always been one of my top series. most of the fillers are very good and the story is interesting. this set contains the awesome fight between the main hero and ulqiorra, the bat like villain of ultimate power.",1394236800,,231,4.523809523809524

5972888,3,B00FA97P2W,"Fans of Bleach will enjoy this.... But the story progression is way too slow to call this a ""DVD set"".

The plot progression is enjoyable... but it moves at a snail's pace.

For me to enjoy any replay value on this DVD set I either need to wait a few years to watch it again, or use a lot of fast-forward to get to the good parts.",1392681600,2,330,3.91044776119403

5972895,4,B00FA97P2W,"I love the story in this main story line, and have been waiting for a while for it to continue.  They have done a great job with it, but I do have a complaint.  The box sets seem to be getting shorter and shorter, this one being only to discs. Combine that with the fact that the first 5 to 10 minutes of every episode is a recap, and you really are not getting that much of the actual show for how much we are patientsng.",1389052800,,422,3.895348837209302

Orihime has some especially irritating qualities here, and tries to shine as well. Mostly I just wish her character had been written better in the manga, so she wasn't so irritating in the anime.",1523145600,,417,4.415584415584416
