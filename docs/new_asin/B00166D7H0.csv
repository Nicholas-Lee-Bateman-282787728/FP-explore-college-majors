8726167,5,B00166D7H0,"My girlfriend bought this DVD because it was offered to her at a discount to get her feedback on it. After seeing how she could hardly catch her breath about half way through the video, I decided to give it a try.

I do cardio about 3 to 4 times a week at my gym, but I still have some extra that I need to lose. Problem is that I hate doing cardio. Doing Rhimba's exercises was fun.  At first I had to watch the learning section over a few times to try and get used to the moves. Once I did it a couple of times with with my girlfriend I loved it. I have a hard time with the Belly Dance section, but it was fun. Trying to do the Belly dance is a tough on you abs and side muscles. I liked the African the most, but it's a killer. I had a hard time keeping up with it. I recommend that you have a towel and a bottle of water ready when you do this. I was sweating a lot more than I do on the treadmill.

The toning part at the end is a killer. If you like Pilates, you'll like the toning part at the end. I could feel my abs and thighs burn even the next day.

Overall this video is great and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to try a different cardio workout.

Some of the steps are a little bit hard if you're not much of a dancer like me. But after doing it a few times, anyone can get the hang of it.",1207180800,5,1318,3.743682310469314
