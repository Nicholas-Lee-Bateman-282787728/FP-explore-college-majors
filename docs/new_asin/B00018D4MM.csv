8007867,5,B00018D4MM,"This is one of the best seasons of Lexx. We all know how outlandish and insane this show is by now. But, there are extremely different tones throughout the series most reviewers fail to realize or even appreciate. The original four movies were a very straightforward Sci-Fi affair. They were unique, but not the best in terms of production. The second season took a Star Trek theme of traveling the galaxies, only to discover that every other living being was recklessly stupid or pointlessly evil, which allowed for enormous amounts of dark humor. The third season on the other hand, was more of a twisted philosophical meditation with religious themes, abandoning the majority of the humor provided in the previous season. By the fourth season, with a thinning budget and news of cancellation, Lexx retreated to the safety of lower production costs by bringing the Lexx crew to Earth.
This is the season where things started to turn even more insane than ever before, and trust me; it's a good thing! The production crew took more risks, was more experimental, and LOADED the show with social commentary. This season had more humor than drama, and it threw a lot of fans off, especially the ones who started watching during the more 3rd season. There are some low points (Mort & Moss), but some of the most memorable episodes come from this season too. Don't miss the ridiculousness of materialism and the American Dream in ""Prime Ridge,"" an excellent re-interpretation and homage to The Seventh Seal in the ""The Game,"" Giggerota as the pope in ""ApocaLexx Now,"" a Godzilla spoof in ""Lyekka Vs Japan,"" and an excellent and climactic series finale to finish the series off!",1260057600,2,1673,4.873684210526315
8007868,5,B00018D4MM,"For those of you that know the series Lexx, you already understand the quirkiness of the theme.  For those of you that have never seen the series, there really aren't any likable characters in the thing.  It generally is dark and depressing and you end up rooting for the crew of the Lexx simply because everyone else is more detached, wicked and evil.

As an example, at the end of most of the episodes, the crew ends up obliterating the planet with which the episode took place.

It is so refreshingly different it instantly became my favorite all time sci-fi series...yes, including Star Trek!  It's clever and wicked.  This fourth series ends up on earth and, I think, does a particularly good parody of the United States (this is a joint Canadian-German production). I would have to say this isn't everyone's cup of tea but, if you have a less mainstream type of sense of humor...Monty Python, South Park, Strangers with Candy...there's a good chance you'll get a kick out of the off beat comedy.

For me, this is a five star series...for some of you, you'll just wonder what the heck the shows about.",1251158400,,1106,4.641025641025641
8007869,5,B00018D4MM,"As good as the other seasons. On the run from the devine shadow & looking for a safe place. Stan the captain who is a coward,Zev the love slave half lizard,790 the robot head who has obsesed love of Zev & wants to get rid of Stan as he sees him in the way of his love of Zev also the only chacter I did not like. Kai the dead assassin who kills whoever Stan or Zev wants him to & to get them out of the trouble there obsessions get them in. Finally Lexx the most powerful wheapon in the two known universes who is a living bug ship that can destroy whole planets & does so at the whim of whomever is captain but also needs to consume organic matter to live. Great series & worth the price.",1185580800,,689,3.9285714285714284
8007870,5,B00018D4MM,"This final (?) installment to the Lexx saga is, (as all the previous ones), quirky, interesting, provacative, and good.  I won't recap as others have probably done.  Suffce to say, if you enjoy any of the Lexx stories you will enjoy these.  If you have to own them, then you must have these also, (as I had to).  The Lexx shows have been a constant enjoyment for me, as a science fiction fan, and a student of philosophy and religion.  I love the diractions they have gone and where they might go next.  Truly a series that went where nhas gone before.",1129161600,4,552,4.362745098039215
