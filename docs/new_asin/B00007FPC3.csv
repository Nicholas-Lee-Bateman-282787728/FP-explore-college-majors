1809650,5,B00007FPC3,"Has anyone mentioned the music score for this? From the first shot of

the courthouse dome, melancholy music perfectly sets the mood for what

will come.

The Eastern (or Indian) theme and the drum at the beginning credits is

haunting. During the seminary scenes, the mens choral is lovely.

Throughout a woman hums a beautiful, sad melody, through certain

transition scenes and always at the opening of a new chapter. Whenever

juror, Johnny Donne, is alone this theme emphasizes his loneliness and

breaks your heart. A number of times we see Johnny arriving home and

walking down a long corridor and opening his door, with this lonely

theme playing. His AA prayer also has the music softly in the

background.

During the Rose characters arrival back home each time, we see her

getting off the elevator and walking into a blinding white light - to

give us a jolt of the searing effort to walk back into that house of

pain. The orchestra with an oboe(?) featured makes one want to cry.

During the foreman of the juries final scenes of frenzy in the tunnel

the Indian song is just perfect - the wail and lament of a man driven

to distraction.

And as the jurors all walk down the hill after the burial, the same

woman humming the theme music makes for a melancholy finale.

For the performances, the great cinematography, and wonderful music

themes, this a rare series from television that is as great as a movie.

Gerald Butler as Johnny is a standout - so intense at times you quit

breathing. I've forgotten the name of the actor who plays the Foreman

of the jury, but he is also outstanding. The whole cast is superb.

A real jewel for anyones collection. 9/10",1112918400,60,1678,4.603389830508474
1809651,5,B00007FPC3,"I will freely admit that I bought this because Gerry Butler  was part of the cast.  His performance didn't disappoint me and it's easy to see why ""The Jury"" was instrumental when the powers-that-be where casting for the movie ""Phantom Of The Opera"".

That said, I was just drawn in to the drama from the begining.  The story about the various lives of those who are chosen to sit on the jury of a hightly charged murder trial is great.  All the actors are outstanding.  Worthwhile watching.",1112400000,10,490,4.574712643678161

In fact, all of the actors are superb and the story so well written.  It keeps you wondering to the bitter end as to whether or not the jury made the correct decision.  I watched the last 4 episodes in one evening and then watched episode 6 again the next day.

  For joy! I was BLOWN away. This magnanimous, superb, top-notch mini-series will forever be rendered as stellar. The actors and actresses are wonderful, fully playing the part they were meant to. The jury is composed of separate individuals, all with their own casualties (perhaps not so much different from our own world!). I was waiting expectantly for the next week's episode, and fully satisfied. The case is plausible (not some silly idiotic case that the viewer can instantly solve) and has interesting refutes. I was captivated. Anyone who has an ounce of intellect, a joy for drama, and a passion for the courtroom will be drawn in just as I have.
  You will be apalled at the injustice and discrimination that is displayed in the film. You will quite possibly yell at the tv, while at the same time you're waiting for the next episode. I suppose that many who wath this will turn their backs on it, but I for one, loved it.

1809656,5,B00007FPC3,"What a powerful piece of drama! Incredible, powerhouse acting and brilliant writing--loaded with subtext. It's impossible to speak too highly of this 6-episode dramatic mini-series.
This story focuses on seven of the jurors chosen to serve on an especially grisly murder trial (a Sikh teenager is accused of slaying a classmate with a ceremonial sword). These jurors are a mix of people, some are eager to serve (a woman in an emotionally stifling marriage; a single mom who is estranged from her mother, but who must ask her mother to care for her daughter while she serves on the jury; a lonely older woman with inoperable cancer; a married man whose powerful sense of civic duty is more than matched by a nagging sense of underachievement); some are reluctant (a seminary student who is unsure whether he wants to continue on his path to the priesthood; a recovering alcoholic just out of rehab; a married man who lost all his family's savings due to a bad business venture he was talked). The story, like the trial it revolves around, is a study of mixed motives, changes of heart, and living with fear. In the process of revealing each characters personal daily struggles we discover just how much of the human experience is comprised of learning to endure and deal with violence. In this drama we see the defendant and witnesses badgered by clever lawyers, friends manipulated by friends, and boundary-violating in-laws prying confidential information out of their son-in-law who is serving as a juror. Even the alcoholic's AA sponsor has a touch of the autocrat about him. And the young woman who has fled to jury duty as a way of creating an adventure for herself ends up using her womanly charms to manipulate a man into falling in love with her (even though she is fully aware that she is not free or capable of taking on a romantic relationship with him). I defy anyone to watch this compelling drama without questioning their own propensity to abuse power. We are all capable of being bullies. It's just a matter of circumstances and opportunity.",1050796800,98,2058,4.81638418079096

I have always been a fan of British mysteries but somehow missed this one.  It is outstanding.  The performances are first rate, Derek Jacobi towering as always.  The personal story of each juror is compelling, and the tension grows as the trial progresses.  This has got to be Gerard Butler's best work despite all he has done since this.

His range of emotion is superb, as always, and his acting outstanding. The trial storyline is interesting, but the interaction of the jurors and their life challenges are equally as interesting.  The plot is good and the acting excellent.  The price is wonderful as I paid $145.00 for mine in 2003 when there was nothing out there by G.B.  Dumb me. Lesson learned.

1809674,5,B00007FPC3,"The Jury was a very well done, six episode ""Masterpiece Theatre"". The performances were stellar by everyone. As most of us have sat on the outside looking in on a trial of this magnatitude, The Jury gives all outsiders a glimpse of what it would be like to sit on a jury, for such a horrific crime. It made me question if it is possible for a juror to come to a conclusion that is fact based only. The Jury was emotional and seemed very true to however brief a time you sit as a juror it could change you forever. I thought it also depicted the very real hate that people have against people of different cultures, and sadly that is a true reality.

You become invested in learning the truth of what happened to cause the need for these 12 strangers to be brought together. If you like Gerard , you will definitely want to buy this movie, he gives a great performance.
The only problem I had was in the end you are left with a cliff hanger, I found myself re watching the movie to see if I had missed something important, but it is just how the writers wanted to leave you, still with some doubts about the verdict.

1809677,5,B00007FPC3,"With some trepidation, I sat to watch ""The Jury"" and became entralled.  The story line is inventive; the cast of characters interesting; the interaction between jury members unusual; and the acting superb.  What could have been dull fare, indeed, became a suspenseful story, which begins as told through the eyes of the prosecution and the lawyer for the defense (both veddy British and veddy articulate).  A find blend of drama, pathos, and food for thought.  My review is short in order to preserve the mystery.  I don't want to give away anything, because the beauty of this story is in the manner in which it unfolds and presents its jewels to the viewer, not the least of which is Gerard Butler, artfully portraying a fragile, delicately balanced alcoholic.  IMHO, a must see for the serious connoisseur of thoughtful films.",1276905600,,829,4.928057553956834

Then there's the lady whose trapped in an abusive marriage; psychological prison. Then the most intriguing, the alcoholic who is trying desperately to climb out of the past entanglements with drink.

1809683,1,B00007FPC3,"""The Jury"", shot with multiple cameras, all apparently hand-held, is the worst photographed Granada Television feature I've ever seen!

1809684,5,B00007FPC3,"I was so impressed (and smitten) by Gerard Butler in The Phantom of the Opera that I picked up The Jury just to see more of him.  I did see more -- I saw an actor of great range in a gentle, achingly realistic portrayal of a recovering alcoholic finding his way sober.  His contribution was beautiful and I loved it.  And happily, there is much more to The Jury.

This is an ensemble piece.  The cast includes Derek Jacobi, Helen McCrory, Sylvia Syms, Nicholas Farrell, Sonnell Dadral, and many equally talented actors, each wearing heart on sleeve.  We glimpse into the lives of these jurors, selected at random and pulled from their routines to serve.  Their stories are touching and true-to-life.  In fact, having recently ended an important but failed relationship of my own, I was stunned to find my feelings of grief and loss mirrored in the life of one of the jurors.

It is also a compelling crime story depicting the trial of a Sikh teenager accused of the violent slashing murder of a classmate who had tormented him.  The trial unfolds through unembellished evidence and testimony.  While not portrayed minute-to-minute, this aspect of the show is scripted so well that you feel you are in the public gallery.  We struggle too as each juror endeavors to sort through the facts of this horrifying crime to come to a verdict -- the right verdict.  The overwhelming responsibility of their task is revealed in its time.  The script does not lead you to jump to conclusions; the outcome is believeable and not completely comfortable.

The musical score is very moving.  The locations and editing are perfect and depict a modern ""London"" inhabited by these diverse jurors.  I am traveling to London soon and plan to visit The Old Bailey so that I can see ""Justice"" for myself.  I give The Jury five gold stars.",1230595200,3,1816,4.693037974683544

1809691,4,B00007FPC3,"Everyone is agreed, I think, that the Brits put out great drama. This is no exception. THE JURY is a very interesting ensemble piece - almost a soaper - interweaving the lives of seven of the twelve members of a present-day jury that is hearing a teenage murder case in London's Old Bailey courthouse. Antony Sher (Shakespeare In Love), as coldly calculating and always smiling Prosecuting Attorney Gerald Lewis, is exceptionally riveting. Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius, Gladiator, Gosford Park) gives a warmer, more humane, and often witty performance as Attorney for the Defense, George Cording. Michael Maloney (The Last Place On Earth, Henry V), as high-strung jury foreman Peter Segal, delivers one of the more interesting performances, trying to fend off his ever interfering father-in-law, who is determined to solve the case and influence Peter's vote. Helen McCrory (Anna Karenina, Lucky Jim) as Rose Davies, a woman who is doing jury duty in order to escape a dull and smothering marriage, is also quite interesting, changing her clothes and makeup at the courthouse each day to become a different person from the one she is at home.

But the real standout is Gerard Butler (Beowulf And Grendel, Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie) as Johnnie Donne, a recovering alcoholic who has just gotten out of rehab and is unsure if he can emotionally handle a high-profile court case. Halfway through the trial, he finds himself falling in love with Rose, whom he doesn't realize is married, and being punished for it physically by her husband. Things go from bad to worse when Johnnie discovers that Rose is married. But he rises to the occasion in the jury room to convince one of his fellow jurors to cast the deciding vote in the trial. Butler does an exceptional job selling his character and fulfilling all promises in his more emotionally charged scenes. He did this coming off Attila, in which he played the title role - a 180-degree different type character from Johnnie - and one in which he  also excelled. Butler was helped in the role of Johnnie by having struggled with alcoholism in his own life, which he readily is willing to discuss.

Some viewers may be disappointed by the visual blandness of THE JURY. It does not hold your attention in that regard. As a matter of fact, I was very disappointed when I first saw it, having become used to such visually stunning British dramas as Horatio Hornblower and Pride And Prejudice. However, what it lacks visually, it pretty much makes up for dramatically. I think I was first pulled into the story by the discussion over the blood-drenched shirt of the defendant versus his red school tie. Which was it that the crossing attendant (the ""lollypop man"") saw? The filmmakers, and the lawyers, handled that question masterfully, and had my respect from that point on.

You won't be disappointed. This is a very good series, and, as I said, Gerard Butler is excellent.

The music is perfect, fits the series to a ""T"". My only minor complaint is, if you have someone in your family who has a hearing problem like at our home, the British accents are a problem to those who are not quite deaf yet, there are NO closed captions in this series, we had to stop it many times to explain just what was happening, a big problem at my home.",1152748800,3,892,4.045197740112994

The author gave us seven in depth views of jurors and glimpses to the other five with above average dialog and a keen unfolding story line. By the end I was more conerned for finding out what happened to the jury than if the accused was really guilty. The cast was stellar and portrayed their roles to perfection.

1809696,5,B00007FPC3,"I bought The Jury last May (2005) before I got to see it after much hemming and hawing. I was kind of worried how good the story was, but I was pleased to see that it was worth buying. I couldn't stop watching it once I started. It's very engaging and addictive. I felt I had to know how it ended from the start. After the end of the fourth episode I cried so much every time Gerard Butler was on the screen. I couldn't look at him after that without crying. Needless to say, I was so happy at the end for his character. (I don't want to give anything away.) I totally recommend buying it to anyone who is on the fence about it...it's totally worth seeing. Gerard's fans are always hoping, I think, to see him get the chance to portray a character with substance, and this series is one of those times. It is a well written story, even if Gerard wasn't in it, but Gerard does a fantastic job in it. :)",1143849600,11,901,4.096045197740113

1809699,5,B00007FPC3,"The Jury is the best mini-series I have seen since Band of Brothers. It is beautifully shot and the music is incredible. It is an emotional journey into the lives of seven jurors serving on a murder trial. It is also an in depth look at the trial. A 16 year old boy is accused of murdering a schoolmate that bullied him. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the outcome of the trial is pure genius and will really leave you thinking. As for the seven jurors, they all have different backgrounds and come from completely different walks of life. One woman is involved in an unhappy marriage and seeks comfort from another juror. One man is a recovering alcoholic. One man suffers from lack of money due to buying and selling stocks. One man is having trouble with his father-in-law, who wants to be involved in the trial and pesters him with questions about the trial, which he is not allowed to talk about. One man is in the process of becoming a priest, but hesitates because  he still has feelings for an old girlfriend. One woman suffers from a brain tumor and is tomented by memories of a lost son. One woman suffers from the lack of a relationship with her mother, who she is forced to call to watch her daughter while she serves as a juror. Although these seven people are different, thay all play a part in helping one another with their problems and together must determine the fate of a 16 year old boy. Like most people who buy this movie, I bought it because of Gerard Butler, but after seeing it, I could have cared less if he were in it. It is a wonderful series, very emotional and very touching. I highly recomend this to everyone because there is a little something in it for everyone. No matter what types of movies you like, there is some of everything in it. And the score is absolutly amazing, it is a very effective touch to the movie in letting you know what the characters are feeling. Excellent performances by everyone... especially Gerry.",1141862400,8,1964,4.4404432132963985

I appreciated Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, so I was interested in another film in which this young actor had a starring role.  I was not disappointed at any time during the movie with any of the portrayals.  The viewer is drawn into the lives of these jurors as the plot unfolds; their personal plights often overshadow the main idea of the movie, the jury trial of a young Sikh boy who is accused of murder.  I seldom watch a movie more than once, but I do plan to rediscover the characters that made this movie so intriguing and so worth the viewing time.",1141776000,4,685,4.286821705426356

1809702,5,B00007FPC3,"I liked this movie very much.  It was very engaging and I could barely wait to finish it.  I've heard comparisons to Henry Fonda's 12 Angry Men and I would use that comparison to describe this movie to someone who hasn't seen The Jury.  However, 12 Angry Men is a better movie.  The Jury has some post-modern ideas thrown in that I dislike -such as using ""feelings"" to determine innocence and guilt. The movie made it plain that the people who wanted to analyze facts and not emotion where a bunch of ""un-feeling bigots.""  Absurd.  While there may be times that one needs to rely on feelings - that is not how a court case is to be decided (I won't go too much in depth for those who haven't seen this movie). Reason and rationality are to be valued.  People who rely on ""feelings"" are easily manipulated and are not people I'd want to be deciding my fate.  Henry Fonda used reason and that won the day, which is why I prefer 12 Angry Men.  That said, this movie is worth watching because the writing is excellent.  The movie is able to pull together many different stories around the court case without confusing everyone.  Highly recommended.",1137024000,5,1144,4.478260869565218

He watched it (and it is 6 episodes of a mini-series shown on London tv) all the way through in one sitting on TWO different occasions.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery, love, relationships, murder trials, interaction between people of all walks of life, and, in general, life.  The ending is inconclusive, and allows the audience to make a judgement call.",1127174400,7,501,4.724137931034483
1809706,5,B00007FPC3,"I first watched this mini-series on PBS while at university. Around the second episode, I had gotten the entire dorm hall watching. The performances are so striking that even those who only wanted to watch basketball became engrossed in the storyline.

Three years after 'The Jury' I still find something related to the series. For instance, the recent story of two jury members from the Michael Jackson trial coming forward to speak about their doubts. Whereas in these series, one of the jurors found herself censured from speaking with her own family regarding the matter.

This is no Court TV show, however. There is plenty of ambiguity and doubt. The barristers do their very best to convince the jurors (and the audience) which side is correct. The evidence can point either way, and the behaviour of the jurors can threaten the trial. None of this would work if it weren't for the actors, who excel in making jury duty the most exciting and harrowing experience an ordinary person may face. All the issues discussed and portrayed in the series are not topical, they are the same individuals in society face everyday: racism, bullying, abuse, alcoholism.

This was also the first series that allowed me to finally pinpoint the 'nameless' actors I had seen elsewhere. Sir Derek Jacobi, Kate Fahy, and Antony Sher to name a few. Sonnell Dadral was believable as the scared main suspect, and definitely someone to watch (someone give him a bigger part than in a few lines of 'White Teeth'!). And I agree with the many reviewers that Gerard Butler was the breakout actor in the series. Thanks to 'The Jury', I became a life-long Gerry fan. His performance is what will break your heart.

I would highly recommend this series to those who enjoy a good dramatic mystery that will keep you thinking long after the credits have rolled.",1124409600,13,1833,4.828025477707007

This DVD mixes both genres successfully and the story it tells of racism and culture clash is tense and engrossing. An added bonus is the ""behind the scenes"" look at the lives of the jurors and their reactions during the trial, the deliberation, and after.
The acting is excellent with wonderful Brits doing their usually Masterpiece Theater best. One standout is Gerard Butler as Johnny Donne - a recovering alcoholic who is the heart of the jury. Johnny's emotional turmoil is brought to painful life by Butler's naturalistic acting.
My only quibble with the DVD is that with the variety of accents speaking English, there are NO subtitles and they might have helped in some areas. (If it had subtitles, it would get 5 stars.)
Gerard Butler fans will love this movie as his character is brilliantly featured and very well done.",1124150400,10,925,4.823899371069182

I'm not usually a big fan of British entertainment, but I did like this. All the acting was solid. It was pretty good for most of it, but it REALLY got interesting once the jury went into deliberation. That took the whole series up several notches and made me glad I spent the money to watch it.

As far as not being rated....I would have given it a strong PG-13 for language. I was told they can allow three ""F"" words in a PG-13 and I counted three.

1809711,5,B00007FPC3,"I just watched the series through again. I had a few questions nagging me. You can't blink, or you will miss something. I love that. I came across this gem of a series quite by accident when ordering ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I never had a chance to see The Phantom in the Theater. I am relieved, however, that I didn't, as no Phantom has ever made me sob so much, I was glad not to be in public.

Anyway, I remembered ""The Jury"" which had popped up on my screen and went back to spend the rest of my gift certificate on it. I love court case dramas. What a gem I found in this set.

The series was very subtle in turning your interest back and forth from the guilt or innocence of the boy into the personal lives of the jurors. I loved it. But for once, it was not the mystery that I was sunk into, it was the impact of the case on the jurors lives.

Some actors were better than others, some situations more interesting than others, such as the man who is emotionally overshadowed by his strong-willed Father-in-law right down to the last moment in the movie. And yet, he played the biggest factor in the outcome, in his eyes at the time. (Much to his own surprise.) But, what follows shows what human spirit that has been shaped in a certain way, does not easily change and he cannot enjoy his victory. Superb performance.

The recovering alcoholic and his AA mentor took the cake.

After reading the posts, I realize, the man who plays the alcoholic has a large female following. This is not from one of them. Not a review from an infatuated young girl or an unfulfilled woman. (My husband definitely fulfills me in every way) However, the performance really is superb and I am of the opinion that some of it comes from Scottish heritage.

The Scottish are wonderful, passionate people and it comes out in their acting. My family's trip to Scotland has been canceled. I've dreamt of visiting such a beautiful place and introducing my sons to the people there who are not boring and inhibited as they are in the States.

Just as Queen Victoria was attracted to John Brown, a Scott who wore his heart on his sleeve and gave his best, we are attracted to the actor with the thick Scottish accent who lived his part with his little tough-love angel. He easily showed deep respect and so looked up to the man who was half his size.

 What the mentor teaches this man is very profound. Everyone should see it and learn from it. We are drawn to tears by the desperation and loneliness in his face, struggling to recover from a life of self abuse. You wonder if it was acting, it was so compelling. I was so glad he had his teacher to hold him because I, being a mom, wanted to reach into to screen and do that. I guess that would make me an ""Enabler""?

And then we are thrust back into the boy's fate and the verdict and whether it was right or wrong.

A visit to people's lives that may be foreign to your own and yet have all the same struggles, fears and small accomplishments. Even in my busy life, kids and kittens running about, I watched the whole thing straight through.
I recommend you do the same.

I hope we shall see more of these actors. Especially Mr. Butler.
However, no matter what else he does do, there will never be anything more precious than that of saving the life of a young boy.
I came across this tidbit when my son was afraid of 'the Phantom' and all his 'make-up.' So, we looked up the actor so that he would picture his face instead. We read this story of him jumping into a river where a boy was submerged and pulling him out to be resuscitated. The boy lived.

We cried because this was exactly what happened when a close friend of the family went swimming in the water when it was too cold. Only my brother-in-law could not save him. We named our son after him, Daniel.

Life is precious.

1809715,5,B00007FPC3,"This mini-series produced and written by Peter Morgan (1), directed by Pete Travis is a compelling look into the social prejudices even within the justice system. It not only deals with the emotional details of a highly heated and publicized murder trial of a young boy, but probes deeper into the individual lives of the jurors who find themselves personally challenged and changed through the experience. In the end they must decide if the evidence is strong enough to convict the 16 year-old boy charged with the gruesome murder of his classmate. They must rise above their own personal demons in the mist of the incredible pressure that two social groups have put upon them, as well as some jury intimidation from the murdered boy's family. The important thing that they will all gain at the end of the trial, is renewed hope and purpose in themselves as individuals. Healing, strength, and most importantly self respect for doing the right thing.

Although all the actors in this film give superb performances, Gerard Butler's was the most intense and compelling!

GERARD BUTLER; (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, DEAR FRANKIE, THE GAME OF THEIR LIVES,DRACULA 2000, and more), gives a five star performance as a struggling, recovering alcoholic who looks for escape in being a juror, and finds temporary diversion from his intense, painful, personal torment. But instead of rescue and solace, he is overcome with feelings of confusion and betrayal which threaten to further devastate what little is left of his self respect and spirit. Get out the Kleenex! The depth that human conflict that Gerard is able to convey here is so true to life you find yourself drawn into his character's struggle as if it were yourself battling for your life. It has given me a whole new respect for people that have drinking problems, and how hard it is for them to find healing and wholeness again. Gerard Butler's multi-faceted talent knows no end, I truly believe him to be one of the most intense acting talents of our time!

SONNELL DADRAL portray's a intelligent,yet gentle boy who is on trial for murder. He does great work with his eyes.

Sir Derek Jacobi (whom not seen since the film DEAD AGAIN) does a fantastic job in playing the powerful defense attorney that must prove his clients innocents with almost non-existent substantial evidence.",1117670400,11,2333,4.913705583756345

Gerry is a lawyer and it was interesting to see how he interacted with the other members of the jury in this case.

7976284,5,B00007FPC3,"I really didn't get this movie at first.  I'm still not sure I get it.  Watching this movie is like looking at a piece of fine art in an art museum.  You respond to it and you feel ""something,"" but you're not sure that what you feel is what the artist intended for you to feel.  And every person feels something different because we each bring to it our own unique perspective based on our own unique experiences.  But at the same time, the nature of the work of art trickles down through our souls and our experiences to shape our own unique reaction to the work of art.  In my humble opinion as an artist, ""The Jury"" is just such a work of art.

Upon much reflection, these are my thoughts on this work of art:  This miniseries moves at an agonizingly slow pace as each piece of evidence in the trial is presented. Dotted in between each piece of evidence, a lot of time is devoted to exploring the ordinary lives of each of the jurors.  We see their hopes, their struggles, their dreams for their own futures, their frustrations and all of their faults and failures.  Finally, we see the jurors struggle to make sense out of all the evidence they've been given and make a final decision that could affect another person's life forever.  Then the idea hits you:  I am one of the Jurors.  The slow pace was designed to give me a somewhat authentic jury experience where I'm forced to look at my own prejudices and opinions about other cultures and races.  This miniseries was deceptively designed to make me take a good look at myself and decide who I really am and how I want to live my life.

I've read the other reviews about this movie -- all very different from my own.  All I can tell you is that for me, this wasn't just a miniseries -- it was a deeply personal experience that has and continues to be very thought provoking.

I won't get into a discussion of actors, costumes, settings and the like because these things are not really relevant to this particular work of art.  The focal point should be determined by the viewer.",1432080000,,2037,4.372340425531915
