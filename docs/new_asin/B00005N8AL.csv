1629373,3,B00005N8AL,"Although it is not the most spectacular DVD ever, its pretty good if you have a busy lifestyle, and need an easy work out to do in the morning or evening.  I travel constantly for my job, and I needed something fairly simple to do if I can't make it to a real gym, or to complement hotel's lacking resources. Although I don't miss the annoying peppy chatter in ordinary exercise workouts, this one is kind of hokey because they don't talk at all, and there's this disembodied voice that randomly chimes in to instruct you, for no reason though....  The only thing that is annoying is they have all these dance sequences in the beginning of each exercise you have to fast forward through, which is cool and all--except you are trying to exercise, not watch a performance.
All and all, I consider this a decent workout if you are starting a routine. Its different, and that makes it more interesting than, say , Denise Austin, who makes you want to hurl sometimes from her voice.",1034640000,11,977,4.5141242937853105
1629374,5,B00005N8AL,"Hey.
I bought this for my mom.  At press time she still hasn't used it, but when I went home recently, I used it (since I am the workout fiend of the group).  It was a great workout, was fun, and I felt really sexy doing it.  I think you probably have to already be able to move your belly to really do it, but it is fun.  Definitely a beginner tape though.  Don't expect to be hoppin' around getting paid $$$ for your belly dancing moves after this one, but it's definitely fun!!",1030320000,5,480,4.0638297872340425
1629375,4,B00005N8AL,"If you ever wanted to get in shape but would rather go out dancing I recommend the Bellydance Fitness videos by the Bidasha twins. The workouts are not the hardest in the world but they are pretty good considering that you not only get toned but you also burn calories, learn muscle issolation techniques, bellydance moves and get it all in a short time since is section in only 25+ minutes long. The Ab movements are my personal favorites, you learn to move in ways you never knew you could before and you feel them working!
The DVD is a great value since you get two workouts for little more than the cost of one! You also get footage of the twins dancing in full costume without the credits rolling overthem like it happens in the VHS. You should also get the Basic Moves, Fat Burning DVD and the Slim Down VHS which is my personal favorite... Have fun! Dance!",1027382400,8,863,4.4

I bought this DVD and the basic fat burning dvd mainly for the abdominal work. The instructors are VERY talented and the programs are easy to follow.  If you are looking for a taebo type energy this workout is not for you.  It is however very tranquil, elegant, and demanding.  After my first workout I felt a burn in abdominal muscles I didn't know I had.  I highly recomend this dvd for moms who are looking to strenghten and tone abs.  It is also a great dvd to learn the art of bellydance.  My husband loves it!",1021593600,28,658,4.336065573770492

After a while, you start to feel the burn, and realize that you're getting exercise! For me personally, if I think about having to ""work out"" it makes it a hard task - something I dread. But if I think of it as fun, or dancing, it's an entirely different story.

The Arms and Abs routine is the one I have the harder time with but no matter how tired my arms and abs might get I still have so much fun! I love how the warm-up, arm section, abs, and cool down all seamlessly transition from one to another, so much so you might not know that you're ending the warm up starting the actual workout.  The Hips, Buns and Thighs is my favorite routine in the whole collection, so much fun and I feel so sexy doing everything in the workout!

This coming from someone who HATES working out. you don't even realize you moved from warm up to workout until your having a seriously hard time holding up your arms. (In the arms and abs section)  the moves in both the arms and abs and the butt hip and thigh section are based around belly dance movements which actually made it easier for me to follow along with a learn to Belly dance video. The workout did work my muscles but I wish it was more intense and I did have a hard time with the rib circles/slide.

The pace is gentle, the moves are within most people's range of motion and there is great encouragement from the narrator (""This is a hard one"" or ""If you can't do the arms, just work the hips"") which really help when first starting the workouts.

1629501,4,B00005N8AL,This is one of the first DVDs I bought when I decided to learn belly dancing. It is a great workout DVD. I really enjoyed it. The movements are easy to learn and it is a great way to tone the entire body. I am not a huge fan of traditional workouts. I can't make myself stick to a gym routine and I'm not a huge fan of crunches. I had to give this DVD 4 stars because I realize that their are other workout DVDs out there that do not feel so much like a gym workout. Even though crunches might work for some people they are definitely not for me.  I think the DVD would have been better if it was only based off of belly dance movements. I do have to agree with other customers that after sticking to the workout for a few weeks you get the urge to look for something different. I would have liked to have seen more belly dance moves and less movements you could learn on a regular workout DVD.,1382832000,,894,3.994413407821229

I have other Belly Dance C.D.'s that don't specify target area's, but do teach an entire routine, plus warm up & cool down. The Title was mis-leading, I wanted to get those target area's and do it through Belly Dance or Belly Dance Moves, that would lead to some type of Belly Dance learning progression.
I exercise, but want to learn more Belly Dancing, so I would not purchase this C.D. As for work-out, it did do a good work-out on the area's stated, but wasn't fun, exciting or gave me an energy boost.

The Arms and Abs is nice and slow paced and makes it feel as though you are hardly even exercising but will leave you sore the next morning. Hips, Buns & Thighs is slightly more energized but not so much that it leaves you worn out. Both are full of graceful and fluid movements that, in parts, make you feel like you're dancing and have suitable background music.

I have built quite a bit of muscle working with this twice a week. And of course, working out to bellydance moves and music makes exercising much more fun. The only downside is that it doesn't teach you the proper bellydance posture, so you can possibly really hurt your back while doing these work outs (I know I had pain), so make sure you look up the correct posture before starting, then you'll be fine!

1629553,5,B00005N8AL,"short version: I've owned this for three years. Product works if you use it. The music is wonderful and even you, yes you, the one that has no rhythm. Even you will start to intuitively/instinctively move to the music. It'll take a few times, but you'll be a natural in no time. Buy Basic Moves + Fat Burning if you want to get moving with bellydance moves and are completely new to the idea of dancing to lose weight. Buy Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns, Thighs if you are a little more familiar to the concept. Buy both if you want some variety. Do not buy if you are respectably in shape or you not a beginner to bellydance.

Long version:
When I bought this, weighed at least 298 pounds (135 kilos). I had seen a late-night infomercial for some sort of dancing for fitness thing. Anyways, since then I've lost 50 pounds so far and I have another 100 to go (23 kilos lost, 46 to go). I want to share that with you to brag a little bit, but also more importantly show that when you eat right and use this DVD, you WILL LOSE WEIGHT.

I was extremely out of shape from desk jobs and I wanted to do something fun and not feel embarrassed at a gym like Curves, but also low-intensity so I didn't feel like dying after two minutes. My very first time following AAHBT was about the 5th time with the twins' video (I had been using BM+FB up to that point). I sort of followed along a little bit, but the exercises were just too much for my weak flabby body. I was very unhealthy and couldn't even keep up. Around my fourth or fifth time, I was able to complete it one of the workouts. Around my 7th time, I could do both consecutively.

'Arm and Abs' is low-intensity exercises based off of bellydance for your arms and midriff. 'Hips, Buns, and Thighs' is medium-intensity exercises based off of bellydance for your lower half. Obviously, you should know that this is for unhealthy people who need to stick their toes into exercise and ease into it. You will not learn how to bellydance, per se, but you will definitely feel like you are.

The narrator's voice is quite pleasant and it is not either of the twins. You can turn it off if you want. The narrator is less 'exercise-y' about it. By that, I mean she is not continuously repeating the numbers of the reps, nor is she explaining HOW to do the moves very much. Since the twins do not speak throughout the video, you will either love or hate this. Basically, the narrator is there is keep you motivated to complete the workout in a calm way. I prefer it like this, but I did find that about my sixth time of working out, I then had some muscles and those muscles realized I had been doing half the workout in a bad/lazy way and then I really felt the burn one I self-learned the right way to do it. If you have a full-length mirror you could pause and compare I guess.

I lost weight (~20 pounds) and built muscle over two months with this through exercise alone (totally was still eating garbage food). Girly muscle is great, being ripped is not! I stopped caring though and gained it all back. About two years passed and then I renewed my determination to be healthy. This time I've lost about 50 pounds and I'm still not tired of BM+FB and AAHBT bellydance videos.

Since I own all three, this next part is to compare this one to the other two. I do Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns, Thighs 2-4 times a week and it is a little more 'workout'. It has some more focused exercises compared to Basic Moves. In other words, BM+FB is closer to actual bellydancing than the AAHBT video. I still have been unable to complete Fat Burning of BM+FB; I'm still 100lbs. overweight and there's some intense jumping/bobbing moves in it and my fat rolls just can't handle it. So in my opinion, I'm only got half a video with content I can't use yet. I do Basic Moves 2-4 times a week. The whole third video, Slim Down, I can't say much. It falls into the 'too fat for it' like Fat Burning. I've tried to follow along because I paid for it, but it's too much. Also, in Slim Down the narrator changed and she's all... exercise-y and stuff. She counts the reps and takes all of the fun out of it, making it a workout chore instead of a fun dance. I only play Slim Down with her voice turned off and unfortunately, without a mellow voice to keep me going, I quit before I'm tired.

You can search for these videos on YouTube and they have been uploaded in ten-minute intervals. If you like what you see, consider the purchase. I am grateful that I purchased BM+FB and AAHBT. I do recommend them to others. However, you might find this easy or boring if you are doing fast-pased workouts like calisthenics.",1364774400,7,4620,4.309551208285385
1629554,5,B00005N8AL,I got a couple of dvd's in case some of the girls want to practice at home to make them feel better when they come to the next class.  We have loads of fun in the class.  It's almost like a social function but a lot more fun and hanging out with the other girls and forgetting about everything else for a while.

1629637,2,B00005N8AL,"This DVD isn't worth the money or time you will waste buying when there are many out there that are much better.
The description is very misleading. This is not a very good fitness DVD unless you have never worked out before or have been bed ridden for years. I had a stroke a few years ago & after doing for only a couple weeks, I found was not challenging at all.
You have to fast forward through the twins talking and dancing between segments, which if they had taken those out & added more exercising in, might have made the DVD better.
The other less annoying facts are that the choreography is disjointed & the narrative isn't inline with the moves.",1352764800,,655,4.377049180327869

While I do have an interest in learning bellydance, this is a workout with bellydance influences to keep it FUN and sexy!  The only thing about it, and this makes me feel a little silly, is that for a while I didn't notice that there were TWO different workout chapters.  The first is arms and abs, and the second is hips, buns, and thighs.  I guess I didn't notice for a while because I would hit ""play all"" and after arms and abs, there would be a cool down and then the credits would play.  One day instead of turning it off like usual, I got distracted with something else and let it play, then I heard a workout I hadn't done before play after all those credits and everything was done.  Oops!  So I thought that was kind of a strange set up, but I'm new to work out videos, so maybe this is normal.  But now that I know that's how it works, I like it.  Both workouts are about 30 mins.  So it helps manage your time if you're short on it for whatever needs more work.  Arms and abs is very fun, you definitely feel the resistance but it's a little bit more relaxing and toning.  Hips, buns, and thighs is still fun but more intensive, this is when I start to sweat and feel more of the cardio.  Easy to follow, fun, and with commitment will yield beautiful results.",1352246400,2,1406,4.178438661710037

Their instructions are pretty clear- I didn't have too much trouble picking it up and I'm extremely slow with these things.  There were a couple sections that I had to rewind and watch a few times before I figured out how to do it.  One of my favorite things about Neena and Veena though, is that they wear pants so you can clearly see what they're doing!  I tried a different bellydance video once, and the instructor wore a long skirt, so I had no idea what she was doing with her legs and feet. It was extremely frustrating!  I do wish that they taught with a mirror- or they could even face different directions, themselves- because it's so much easier to learn when the instructor is facing the same way you are!  It takes me a while to flip everything around and I often find my legs in the right position, but my arms are completely wrong!

1629672,5,B00005N8AL,"I wanted a DVD that would really teach belly dance movements and also provide aerobic exercise.  This DVD provided everything I was looking for.  Each movement was broken down and demonstrated by Neena and Veena--and there were side views as well as facing forward views so that one could get a clear picture of the desired movement.  The directions are provided by an unseen narrator which allows the two women to just concentrate on demonstrating the movement being instructed.  I also liked the inclusion of floor exercises and the thorough warm up and cool down sections.

I have purchased a couple other belly dance (for beginner) DVDs and after using them once or twice, never went back because the movements were not thoroughly taught before another was presented.  Rewinding a DVD is counter-productive when attempting to do a physical workout.  With Bellydance Fitness, rewinding is not necessary.

I highly recommend this video.  This was also the opinion of the woman who teaches the bellydance aerobics class I take.",1285200000,4,1028,5.071428571428571
1629673,2,B00005N8AL,"I bought this DVD for two reasons:

1. I wanted to learn some belly dance.
2. I needed to get into better shape.

As far as workouts go, it isn't bad.  I used this DVD and one or two others and I managed to go down a pants size.  Which was great for me, because as I said, I needed to get into better shape.  The flow on the first part of the program was nice.  You work your way down your body so to speak, going from your arms to your ribs and finally your abs.  However, I'm sure there are better ways to do crunches.  I don't know about anyone else, but I cannot for the life of me hold my legs straight up in the air without using method of support.  I just can't do it.  I have to prop my legs up on my couch when I do this just so I can continue along with them.  The second half seemed a bit more stop and go.  It focused more on isolating than an actual flow.  Which is alright, since there was some sort of sense in one exercise following another.

However, if you want to learn how to belly dance while getting in shape....pick up a different DVD.  While there are definitely elements of belly dance used in the workouts, unless you are at least vaguely familiar with the movements, and correct posture, they aren't going to teach you.  They only really break down two movements on the entire DVD: chest circles in the first half and HUGE hip circles in the second half.  There is no break down of snake arms (unless you count the voice over saying ""Elbow, wrist, fingers....elbow, wrist, fingers"" as you do it), no break down of hip lifts and drops.  You just launch into it.  Call me crazy, but if this were my first foray into hip lifts and drops, I'd want to know how to do them properly so I don't strain anything.  There is no instruction on how NOT to do these moves or why you want to do it the way the twins are.  I don't remember if they cover any of this on their Basic Moves and Cardio DVD, but I gave up on that one pretty quick.

Production wise, it's okay.  I really could've done without the little dance and speech.  The short dance they do at the beginning of each half would have made more sense on a strictly instructional DVD.  Seriously, why do a dance for me if I'm not going to learn how to do it?  The set is nice and the music is lovely.  The voice over isn't too intrusive.  The twins, however....yeah.  One of them seemed like she was miserable and would rather be anywhere but there, even when she was almost sort of smiling.  The other had the biggest, most fake plastic smile I've ever seen while projecting a ""Look at me!  Isn't this the most fun ever??!!  Now look at me some more!!!!!!"" attitude.  It was kind of annoying.  Maybe because this wasn't an instructional DVD, but there was no sense of genuine enthusiasm, fun, or encouraging.  Neena and Veena just seemed so wooden.

All in all....if you have a basic grasp of the moves from an instructional DVD or beginner's class, this is a great DVD to pick up to apply belly dance to a workout.  If you've never learned how to belly dance, learn the basics and then get this DVD.",1284508800,4,3075,4.186006825938566

1629675,5,B00005N8AL,"This video is a great tool for beginners in belly dance to use as an exercise tool.  Neena and Veena are professionals in dance, and make it look easy.  The nice thing about using dance in your work out routine is that you can participate and get something out of the exercise for many steps through the learning process.  Of course, it can add a layer of fun to have a belly dancing outfit on while exercising.  Either way, it works many muscle groups while focusing on grace of movement.",1279411200,,489,4.4

I do a lot of outdoor activity so it tends to be my winter workout routine. I got out of practice and recently pulled out this DVD which I had bought when I'd worn out one of the VHS tapes (since given the others away to a friend). I can't believe I had stopped doing these workouts. It's like seeing old friends and I'm enjoying working out again instead of dreading it.

As I stated in my review for 'Slim Down', the twins' enthusiasm for bellydancing is inspiring and infectious- they smile with genuine pleasure as they move and you can tell that they're repressing the urge to really let loose to the pulsing, traditional music. They get to do just that later on the DVD when you get to see them perform several dances in full costume. If you're only going to get one DVD, however, I would recommend 'Slim Down' over 'Arms...'- it's a little more strenuous and the moves are more fun.",1268524800,5,622,4.5625
1629690,1,B00005N8AL,"This is my very first exposure to belly dance, I am an absolute beginner and I was highly disappointed. Enough so that I took the time to write this review.

As has been said in previous reviews the twins are a pleasure to look at, the moves they perform are graceful and sensual. Unfortunately my moves were not. There is NO direction from the narrator as to what to do and when to do it. ""Up and UP and up and circle circle circle"" hand in hand with ""up and down, front and back"" etc is all that you get. I like to be reminded to ""engage those abs"" and as a beginner I believe you need the reminders as well as the knowledge of steps of the movement you are trying to achieve.

I am not one step closer to knowing those magical belly dance hands I see them do, or how to maintain proper posture while performing these moves. I never knew which way to rock my hips and ended up arching my back beyond normal in order to achieve these ominous chest thrust movements that I have no name for because the video never even said what they were called or what exactly I was supposed to be focusing on. I know I was doing the movements wrong, I could feel it but again, there is no hand holding in this video.

At the end of my workout I have a sore lower back, I've wasted an hour of my precious workout time, not to mention my $10.

If you're a true beginner do yourself a favor and buy a video that instructs the proper technique and has step by step moves. That's what I'm about to do.",1265846400,14,1482,4.082474226804123

The twins perform the moves as an unseen narrator gives instructions, which is not always effective.  There are several transitions that are completely uncued in the narration, while at least one cue to ""pulse"" leaves the viewer wondering, ""Pulse what?""

1629732,4,B00005N8AL,"Make no mistake: this is a workout video with bellydance moves, not a bellydance video.  It will teach you some bellydance moves, but it will not make you into a bellydancer; you'll need another video (or a real-life instructor) for that!

First off, Neena and Veena are both pleasant instructors, with nice attitudes in their introductions.  Their choice of outfits is also good, as both are wearing simple sports bras and leggings with a small hip scarf; this makes it easy to follow their movements without distracting costumes getting in the way.  (Amusingly, they're not identical dancers.  One is smoother with her hips, the other with her arms.  It's interesting to see how they vary in their styles.)  Their smiles look a bit forced after a while, but one can hardly blame them for having tired cheeks.

The moves are simple and easy to follow, though the faceless narrator isn't the best at giving cues, so you really have to watch the twins to see what they're doing.  You do definitely need some coordination, especially when first getting the hang of the moves, as a lot of time is not spent on each one before moving on to the next and they're not broken down well in the instruction.  Some positions are also named but not explained, such as the Cleopatra positions.  This won't matter after the first go-through, but it makes it more difficult initially.

The production values are mediocre.  It doesn't much matter in the exercise portion, but I find that the bonus dance segments and their intricate costumes suffer from some blurring and pixelization.

Overall, despite my complaints, I rather like this video.  It doesn't make you sweat, but you'll be feeling the muscles you use.  Experienced dancers or people looking for a more hard-core workout probably won't find much here, but most other people should find it more than satisfactory.",1223769600,2,1859,4.872611464968153

Did I say that I am significantly overweight?  Yep!  And I can do these movements!  Just this week, I have noticably been able to loosen up my back, neck, and arms.  I can't completely accomplish the stretches as fully as they do because of the weight on my legs and stomach, but I do the best I can.  I know I will get there!

Overall the workout isn't strenuous, except I found the hip drops & hip lifts section really worked my butt tough in a way that non-bellydance workouts haven't targeted.

The 25min workout includes the following: leg stretchs, inner thigh lifts, outer thigh lifts, knee bends (like mini-lunges), butt squeezes (I wish they explained these a little more), lots of hip circles, hip drop & hip lifts (these definitely were tiring), walk on balls of feet, thigh stretch (unless you're agile & have strong abs, skip this cause it's easy to hurt your back and knees), cat stretch.

I like how the instructors wore simple outfits that weren't distracting.

This video is for people new to belly dancing who want to learn individual moves and practice their strength & coordination in doing those moves.  But don't except a super-tough workout or a dance routine.

1629811,5,B00005N8AL,"The last section of this workout video has perhaps one of the most amazing Bellydance routines I've yet to see. It was simply inspirational. Just a pity the credits were already moving along the left side obscuring some of the dancing. The outfit Veena or Neena Didasha was wearing was incredible. I want one. ;( Pout. It was like her entire body was under her control, very sexy.

This workout is based on the ancient form of artistic movement and is one of the most sensual dances you will ever see or experience. Veen and Neena look like twins to me and they are rather cute to watch. They have been practicing Bellydance since childhood and have traveled throughout the Middle East and India to perform and develop their techniques. They have also performed for film, television, theater, music videos and even during Academy Awards.

I've tried other Bellydance workouts and this was is definitely different. It is not all belly dancing. It is a Bellydance themed workout. Normally, the dancers show you routines to follow. They normally show you the basics first and then you put them into a routine.

With that said, I managed to make it through this entire workout. There are some pretty difficult moves while you are sitting on the floor. Can we say Cleopatra? Yeah, that one was difficult.

This really reminded me a lot of Pilates and some yoga more than dancing. Perhaps it is more the preparation before dancing. I guess this is the theme and you do get to shake your hips around a lot which is very freeing if you like to loosen up your lower body and back. It is always fun to do goddess-type workouts.

I'd not recommend this workout to anyone with a bad lower back, that is for sure. Your legs are also going to get a good workout and this is definitely a dancer-level workout. Your feet have to be in good condition to do some of the up-on-your-toes dancing. You don't have to be overly coordinated to follow this particular workout because each exercise is done over and over and you can eventually catch up before the next exercise starts.

It is unique, that I'll say. You won't really be doing any dance routines, just some moves and some isolated lower body moves.

Some of the things you do: circling hips, standing still and moving your hips in various directions, beautiful and traditional hand movements, stretching, cat stretch, Pilates moves, some yoga poses. It seems that half of the workout is on the floor and the other half is standing.

Loved the music and this workout will help you develop your sexy side.

1629812,3,B00005N8AL,"This is definitely a fun workout, but it is more of a dance-inspired workout than a dance workout. I mean, they have you do floor exercises, like crunches, and the only real difference is some flippy hand movements and the like.

It's also a bit redundant to have two of them demonstrating; I know they're sisters and this is what they do, but do we really need to watch twins doing the exact same thing? I'd rather have a closer-up shot of one woman the whole time.

I don't like how there aren't any pauses whatsoever between moves. The narrator could give more instruction (I particularly was unimpressed with one transition in the ""hips, buns, and thighs"" section where they switched to another exercise without even telling me; I was concentrating on moving, not watching the screen, and I didn't realize they'd moved on until I heard the narrator say ""down down down"" and realized they were doing hip drops) and tips for proper movement.

Perhaps it's because I'm not as in shape as I could be, but I found myself wearing out and wishing there was a short period of stretching after some particularly strenuous moves. There are also some exercises that are NOT good for someone with a bad back (one where you are on the floor, sitting, and then you prop yourself on your hands and lift your rear off the floor and hold it for about five minutes. Definitely too much of a strain, especially for a ""beginner"" video). And others that are supposedly for ""abs"" seem to put more strain on the arms (holding yourself up) and neck (holding your head up) than anything else.

Still, the dancing parts are really fun. Hip drops, hip and ribcage swiveling, and plenty of arm moves. It's worth a try.",1163030400,9,1694,4.599337748344371

This workout might not look like much at first, but you will feel it - especially in your arms. The moves are simple and easy to do, you probably won't have any trouble keeping up, but they still provide quite a good workout.

There's 2 workouts on this DVD, my favorite being the Arms & Abs workout. You can do either the Arms & Abs or the Hips, Buns, & Thighs workout, or both. My only complaint is that each workout isn't a solid 30 minutes - it's more like 27 minutes of workout preceeded by 3 minutes of Veena & Neena dancing and giving an introduction (and followed by one or the other dancing while the credits roll). I know, only 3 minutes, not a big deal, and the dancing and intro are not bad by any means. I'd just rather it be 3 minuts of dance/intro, 30 minutes or workout, and then the credits. Like I said, not a big deal, just a little something I'd like to see improved.

Be advised if you do both workouts, it plays the credits for the first workout and the intro for the second in between the end of Arms & Abs and the beginning of Hips, Buns, & Thighs. So you might want to have the remote handy to fast forward through that.",1154736000,19,1258,4.190082644628099

In the first half of the workout, you will do a variety of arm movements, most of which require you to hold the arms at shoulder level or above. Although the voiceover instruction suggests that these moves will tone your biceps and triceps, I felt them mostly in my shoulders, which quickly became fatigued. Eventually, you move on to working the chest and ribs, mainly through isolation movements. The final ten minutes of this workout are performed on the floor. You'll start with several non-traditional abs exercises--eg, leg lifts while propped on your elbows--and then you'll work on more traditional crunches. The workout finishes with several yoga-inspired stretches, and the total time comes in at about 28 minutes.

Overall, I found this to be an okay light toning routine. However, because the workout concentrates on the upper body, there is no footwork, which removes the fun factor (as well as the cardio work) that exists in other videos of this series (eg, Basic Moves). If you're interested in toning the arms and abs and are looking for something a bit different, this workout might be for you, but if you want to experiment with some fun bellydance moves, you'll probably want to try one of the other videos in the Bellydance for Fitness series.",1122249600,34,1460,4.983606557377049
1629864,5,B00005N8AL,"This is one of my first DVDs on bellydancing & what got me into it 2 years ago. Great instruction, great pace & fun! :-)  This is very low impact with more emphisis on working out then learning to dance, but this was one of the first DVD/videos out years ago for bellydancing & working out. It's also in 5.1 surround sound as well. Neena & Veena are my favorite bellydance instructors. They have a fun, graceful way of dancing that makes you want to join in. Dolphina the Goddess Workouts, Jenna, Jillina, & Neons are good too, but Rania's are way too stiff/robotic.

The problem is not the program but the product itself.  The dvd is not synchronized properly.  The pictures stutter/halt making it difficult to align the voice over instructions with the images on the screen.  Amazon was great about sending a replacement. Unfortunately, it did the same thing.

1629876,5,B00005N8AL,"I know people are surprised by the ""Fat Burning"" section of this tape- and it is a bit tough to build up stamina for it, but come on, what do you expect? It is the fat burning part (aka cardio) and therefore is going to be tougher. Just don't push yourself to do as many repitions of each movement (until you're ready) and you should be fine!

I have to say the basic moves portion is utterly fabulous! I tend to build muscle pretty quickly (and lose it just as fast, but oh well) but I got better abs in just 8 days. 8! My friends were really jealous and I'm sure if I'd kept doing the basic moves everyday they would have lasted longer.. but I still have the DVD and I adore it!

Summary: Basic Moves are awesome, but don't expect Fat Burning to be easy- that's why it's called Fat Burning. It's a cardio that sure as anything beats running a mile!",1111104000,10,850,4.1454545454545455
1629877,3,B00005N8AL,"A caveat to begin:

I bought two (defective - skipping straight out of the case) copies of the DVD before getting it on video. Emails to Natural Journeys Customer service went unanswered. The ""extras"" on the DVD consist of bonus performance footage (the same footage at the end of each of the videos), benefits of bellydance (goes on for pages and pages - essentially every positive benefit you could ever want) and commentary. Pretty useless. Buy it on video.

I'll start with the negatives... and with the aforementioned commentary.

- Most of the bellydance exercises are ineffective if you use improper posture and form. Unfortunately, there is very little guidance as to proper form. I was hoping the commentary would provide this, but it is mostly dead air interspersed with the twins talking about buying costumes in Egypt, and saying ""this exercise is great for toning....""

- The routines are very slow-paced, and could be quite boring for many people.

- Although the twins have wonderful form for dance moves, I wince watching them perform the more standard exercise moves. Ex. lunges where knees go far past the toes, bad form on crunches..

- The twins have distracting ""stage smiles,"" and the voice-over narrator keeps making reference to how ""sensuuual"" everything is.

The Good:

- These are great, short exercise routines for the beginner. For someone with an interest in bellydance who doesn't mind a slow pace, they could be quite fun. The only exception to this is that the end of the ab tape is WAAAYY harder than the rest of the videos. My abs hurt for days.

- The twins have great dance form, and are cheerful. The cueing is pretty good.

- On an interesting note, one of the twins appears to be a far better dancer than the other. The camera work focusses on her, however.

A tip: when doing bellydance you should have very upright posture, with the shoulders back. If you do not do this with the arm exercises you will only work your shoulders. With the shoulders back, some of the work is shared with triceps/biceps etc.",1106524800,90,2047,4.754237288135593
1629878,4,B00005N8AL,"I love how the workout targets each body problem area while teaching poise, I have had this tape for a year and do it at least 3 times a week. I recommend a coin hip scarf it helps you with the hip moves (and makes you feel more like a dancer).  The only negative comment has nothing to do with the content but more of the menu, I like a workout dvd that will allow you to by pass all the intro talk and dance part and allow you to get to the actual instructional part without having to fast forward.  (Kathi Smiths flex appeal is terrific and with a great menu as well)",1106092800,3,570,3.991228070175439

In the few dance sequences, Veena and Neena's dancing and costumes were beautiful and I would have loved to have the movements broken down so I could learn, but the DVD did not provide that.

I really felt this was more of a workout exercise video with a few bellydance moves thrown in.  I was very disappointed, because the DVD description said ""Conventional abdominal workouts can be extremely strenuous and uncomfortable, but this program will teach you moves that are easy, sensual, and fun.""  When I watched the DVD, I found myself having to take off my bellydancing coin belt and skirt to get on the floor to do those conventional abdominal exercises anyways with the only difference being with some prettier bellydance-like arms motions.  I somehow missed the easy, sensual, and fun part, unless you count watching the twins dance.

For an exercise video, this would be fun.  To learn bellydance, there wasn't much in here worthwhile.  I gave my video away.",1093392000,16,1164,4.756218905472637

I've tried many different workouts - Richard Simmons, Tae Bo, Mari Winsor Pilates - and this is one of the funnest workouts yet!  For a beginner this would be a great video to try because it's fun and goes by quick.  I've found that videos like Tae Bo, while great, get boring after a while.  This is a great way to mix it up a little bit!  I have been using this and The Method Afro-Brazilian dance and really enjoy it!  The voice over doesn't bother me - I can see how it might be difficult to talk while doing these moves.  Neena and Veena's wonderful physiques make me want to do even better - and now I've developed an interest in Bellydance!  Don't worry if you're more heavy set - it's still fun and no one's going to be watching!  And - the only way to get those beautiful belly dancing bodies is to exercise - you gotta start somewhere!

1629882,5,B00005N8AL,"My aerobics videos experiences are by no means diverse, but after just a week this is already my favorite DVD, and has actually gotten me to stick to a routine of working out first thing in the morning because it's so enjoyable.
Gone are the obnoxious perky shrieks and whoops like I hear from Kathy Smith and crew; the voiceover doesn't bother me, and the music is soothing, not cheesy and thudding. The relaxed tone almost leads me to believe I'm not even doing much work--which I assure you is NOT the case. The first couple of rounds of these two workouts made me sore, sore, sore, in some places I didn't even realise I was sore until I did the exercises again. There are very few segments of the workouts that I truly ""dread"" (all who have done the leg lift in Arms & Abs will know exactly what I mean) but I've seen remarkable improvement in my muscle tone and flexibility in just a few weeks. I'm not as clumsy as I used to be, and just in day-to-day activities find myself with better posture and muscle usage.
And no, these workouts will not teach you HOW to bellydance, but the moves are nice and I'm confident that when I start taking actual bellydancing classes this fall I will not have nearly as much trouble with either moves or endurance. Some of the moves took me several exercise sessions to figure out, but they've all been worth it.

That's why I am thankful for this DVD. If ever you feel self-conscious about any part of your body, zap it with either one of these 30 minute routines. They're not easy, but concentrate - you'll get it and feel it without a doubt.

This work out is low impact, but intense and I can promise your arms will be whimpering (in a good way) at the end of the Abs and Arms portion.  The Hips, Buns & Thighs section is fun, full of energy, and will make you work up a slight body shimmer (sweat).

the hips, buns and thighs portion of the dvd is not so challenging.  i know the title says beginner, but that is misleading.  it is a good work out for someone who does little to no physical activity on a daily basis.
the instruction is clear, and vaguely annoying. the interface sucks, and there are dance clips as a ""bonus"".  i wouldn't recommend this if you are fairly active.  get the basic moves and cardio instead.",1069372800,2,676,4.291338582677166

The only negative (if you can call it that) is that if you have never bellydanced before, you may have to watch the DVD once or twice in order to get the movements down.  But on the positive, Neena and Veena wear exercise tights and bra with just a hip scarf (not fully belly dancing garb), so you can really see the movements (most of which come from the thighs and knees, so this is important.)

If you expect these women to tell you how many ""aerobic certifications"" and ""how many repititons"" then this is not for you.  That being said, if you've been to aerobic classes, you should remember proper body positioning so you don't hurt yourself.  This is a basic assortment of issolated belly dance movements arranged in a traditional ""aerobic class"" style with the goal of getting you to move. The fact that it's belly dance makes it fun and does serve as a distraction from the muscles screaming ""I can't move this way!""  I particularly enjoyed the arm segment because it worked the muscles I need to sustain these moves in my dance (snake arms being the bain of my exsistance).  As I continue to work with this DVD, my arms are grudgingly cooperating and I have found that my abs are starting to get with the program too.  I also liked the hips segment for the same reasons.
I gave this 4 stars because the voice over track was off a little in my copy.  Could be my DVD player but I loaned it to a friend who had the same problem.  Also the instuctions weren't always accurate with the moves.",1052611200,8,1171,4.388888888888889
1629901,4,B00005N8AL,"I don't technically have the DVD yet (it's in transit as I post this), but, I have both routines on video.
If this is a direct transfer, it can't help but be wonderful :).
Neena and Veena have made my boring exercise maintenance into a fun and muchly-anticipated part of my week. I did these routines near daily for 3 months, and then transitioned them to once or twice a week (doing other things, also). But, during that three months I improved my flexibility (I can reach *past* my toes!), my muscle tone, and learned to pinpoint my muscle isolations.
These two workouts have a good mix of ""traditional"" exercise movements (squats, lunges, crunches, etc.) and movements unique to belly dance. I think the twins provide an almost flawless method to learn the movements, as the routines are slow enough that you don't need a separate teaching segment, but, fast enough to keep you improving once you know what you're doing. I really appreciate their teaching style. They wear snug spandex workout clothes with dainty scarves, so, you can clearly see what they're doing. Plus, there's two of them, so, if the camera angle is a little ""off"" on one, you can see what to do from looking at the other.
The arms and abs routine is dedicated to strengthening your arms, rotating through a variety of arm movements, and an almost yoga or pilates style ab workout. These seem to be a bit more general, in the sense that you're working your full arms and shoulders for the arm routine, and most of your abdominals at the same time, for the ab routine.
The hips, buns and thighs routine is more focused on isolated movements. There's also a good stretching section that I really like.
What's particularly nice is that they teach you ""real"" belly dance movements but in the structured environment of exercise routines. So, you can enjoy these workouts if you're looking for something a little different, or, to build up a basic collection of movements. However, if you want to learn to dance properly, you'll have to look elsewhere. These are exercise routines, not dance lessons.",1044921600,192,2068,4.747222222222222

Be warned, you're going to look pretty goofy trying to shimmy your hips while doing ""snake arms"", but in the morning your [body] will HURT like it never has before.
 Plus, there's no large men with socks in their unitards screaming, ""Knee! Knee! Kick!"" to spoil the fun.
One word of caution, however:  They don't actually teach you HOW to bellydance or dance routines or anything, so don't buy this thinking you'll be Princess Kashmir or some sh*t.
