It's a film for someone looking to explore a digital world crossed with stop motion animation. M DOT STraNge is indeed strange. This movie was UBERDIRECTED by him, meaning it's entirely his own. Aspiring film makers should check this out for no reason but to view his commentary and the making of. This movie is refreshingly absurd.",1340841600,,437,4.688311688311688
8216769,5,B000V6LT8U,"We Are the Strange is a brilliant effort by ONE MAN to create a feature length mixed-media animated film, which he pulls off flawlessly. Some may disagree with the ""flawlessly"" part of that statement, but the point of one guy spending 12 hour days for years at a time working on a film is because he wanted to make HIS OWN film. Not for the money, not for the fame. This is a guy who dedicates everything to achieving his vision. And he did it.

We Are the Strange is a film that pulls it's influence from a plethora of material, from Hitchcock to Godzilla. If you're a fan of film making, you will spot many homages. M.Strange takes the time to hold the camera on his subjects, often giving you time to absorb the atmosphere and subtle details present in almost every shot. If you have a short attention span, or if you're not willing to put some time in to understand what's going on, you won't appreciate this film.

If you're looking for something different, something special, this is the film for you.",1327363200,,1007,4.437837837837838
8216770,5,B000V6LT8U,"There isn't enough that can be said about this film.  This is coming from someone that has been following the director for about four months prior to the film's release.  Here is the temptation to go off on a tangent, so I'll get back to the film itself...

Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, watch something different for once.  Think about it.  Most movies you go to see nowadays, you know what to expect.  Maybe there's a USP nestled in the script somewhere, but it's beneath the usual weave of some kicks, punches, a few explosions of TNT and sex, and a dead hero or two as if it were the most original plot twist.

We Are The Strange turns the concept of a movie on its head entirely.  As noted by others, this feels like a trip through an art gallery.  When's the last time you saw a movie that gave you room to sit back and take in the sights and THINK and EMOTE about what you're seeing?  Note that modern media is catering to the shrinking average attention span...

To be forewarned is to be forearmed... you WILL need some above-average patience for this film.  It doesn't take you by the wrist and whip you around a labyrinth with no time for sightseeing.  Yeah.  You'll need the patience of a gamer.  :)  That's it.

Make a hot drink.  Put on some headphones if you have them.  Get ready to spend some time paying attention to what your eyes and ears are telling you.

So you may not like it... but you will have done yourself the favor of stepping outside the box.  That fact alone will set you apart from the masses, just the way this film is set apart from mainstream media.",1270425600,2,1597,4.291946308724833
8216771,3,B000V6LT8U,"Some may say this movie is Brilliant and Some may say it's just ok, well they're both right. As long as you only watch this thing for maybe 15-20 minutes at a time.  That is as long as I could take it.  I actually tried to watch the whole thing, but quickly lost interest fast as it became just too monotonous and WIERD, and the novelty and brilliance of the film wore off soon. Thus I think if you watch this movie for just 15 min or so a day then it may keep interesting as there is NO STORY per se and none of the sequesnces seem to follow any kind of sequence.  It actually seems like a series of wierd shorts with some common characters here and there to try and tie it all together.  If you are a DIE HARD artist or appreciator of ART then you might like this film.  If you are looking for a good story or something ""cute"" you are barking up the wrong wierdly shaped tree.

In closing, This movie is only for the hard core!! Thanks for reading this.",1255996800,,955,4.053191489361702

8216773,5,B000V6LT8U,"You will only like this movie if you are strange. Hence, We Are The Strange. This will be nothing like anything you have ever seen before. Your perception of reality will be forever altered. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it.",1225497600,,218,4.475
8216774,5,B000V6LT8U,"A delightful excursion from normalcy, We Are The Strange is entirely unique and exquisitely crafted.  With limited dialogue and little action, the viewer must absorb the imagery and cherish the characters, scenery, and score.  M Dot Strange wished to part from the stagnation of Hollywood and create something with real value.  He has achieved his goal marvelously.",1214611200,2,365,5.368421052631579
8216775,5,B000V6LT8U,"I had first heard about this film online when I was surfing then. I began to look it up. The director M-Dot strange himself is strange but beneath his strange exterior lays cinematic...well awesomeness.

Many people put the movie down and all which everyone is entitled to their opinion but the fact that a lone man could produce this by himself is enough to get my vote.

The film follows Em, a small doll boy who is in need of Ice Cream. He meets up with an Ex stripper named Blue who was fired by the evil Him. Together they both travel throughout M-Dot's strange and bizarre world in order to find Ice Cream.

In the film we are also introduced to a multi masked character who goes  by the name of Rain and his Sidekick Ori. They together take on Monsters in the Eletric City in which they inhabit.

This film reminds me of an Anime Mix of Akria and Blade Runner which should give you a hint to the bizarreness of the film.

The disc is loaded with features and besides what some reviewers might think, the disc is informative. Including a segment called M-Dot's desktop which show how he made certain scenes of the film.

M-Dot ROCKS!!!",1210032000,7,1141,4.404761904761905
8216776,5,B000V6LT8U,"This film...as weird and trippie as it is, has got to be one of the better films I've sat down and watched...
It is one that sucks you into its mesmerizing fantasy world and doesn't let go till the last frame.  The str8nime animation was completey amazing and added to the films dark and original scene. True, this film could be considered an acquired taste, and those lacking an open mind will most likely not enjoy it as much...but all-n-all, it is one of the cooler animated, creative, film-festival-recognized films i've seen in a long time. Props to M-Dot Strange for such an epic and Tim Burton-esk custom stylized masterpiece. And the soundtrack is one of the best parts...along with a feature on the DVD that gives an optional 5 tracks to change to mood of the film...its like 5 movies in one...not counting the Directors Cut and the second disc features...
Great Box, Great Release, Great Animation technique and props for originality!",1196294400,5,944,4.791411042944786
8216777,1,B000V6LT8U,"It certainly looks interesting and original. Mysterious even.
But beware! when you pop in this DVD all the mystery will be gone. The only thing remaining will be your mind wondering what the hell just happened and what were you thinking when you bought this.
I.e. this str8nime (official term) has no solid plot, only a pitiful excuse for one. It jumps back and forth between scenes; nothing is explained; and the viewer is constantly annoyed with strange sounds and head-spinning art, which, while trying to be original and interesting, doesn't really add anything but frustration at the lack of anything meaningful.
So, while it might look like a really interesting piece of art on the outside, be forewarned: there is only frustration and confusion on the inside.",1196294400,14,766,4.9921875
