3872696,5,B0028IJ7VK,"lovely and funny story, but there is a problem with the synchronity of sound and motion picture. If you fast forward or rewind, you risk loosing the synchronity and have to watch a scene with the text following later when another scene has started.",1358035200,,248,4.659090909090909
3872697,1,B0028IJ7VK,"After watching the preview of the movie at the beginning of another DVD, I tried to find it for rental.  Unfortunately I couldn't locate it, so I decided to buy the DVD.  I should have given up when it was not available as a rental...after watching about 30 minutes of this amateurishly made foreign film, I shut the player off.  Complete waste of my money!!",1315180800,,358,4.476923076923077
3872698,3,B0028IJ7VK,"I, family and friends enjoyed this cult movie of greater than 10yrs old. Something refreshingly different with the clash of new and the old, East vs West.",1303344000,,154,4.7407407407407405
3872699,1,B0028IJ7VK,"An old work colleague recommended this movie. I finally got around to buying when the price came down from $95 to $20. All I can say is that thank god I didn't buy it at the $95 level. I sat down to watch it. Dozed off after 10 minutes after failing to make sense of this mambo-jumbo and went off to bed. My partner stuck it out to the end. She said it wasn't bad. A satire on the life in Russia before the Berlin wall came down.

I don't know. Maybe it is or it isn't. I just thought it was rather hopelessly confusing and messy.",1296259200,,530,3.953271028037383
3872700,4,B0028IJ7VK,"I bought this DVD when I realized I had accidently ordered a VCR for my husband for Christmas.

The video quality was good, but the translation interfered with the quality of viewing.  There were times when there were both subtitles and a voice translation - too much confusion.  But my husband seemed not to notice and enjoyed it thoroughly.",1264464000,,342,4.762711864406779
8356254,2,B0028IJ7VK,"So far when trying to watch it it had language selections. But the one i choice had english subtitles, great but when the girls were talking it was dubbed with a male voice over them in the same language so it took away from the enjoyment of the movie.

Will have to try 2nd language option at beginning of movie.

Other then that. Was the same movie i remember when I first saw it in school.",1475884800,,392,4.144736842105263
8356255,5,B0028IJ7VK,Now I remember why I hadn't bought the DVD to replace VHS tape of this! My husband adores this movie and drives everyone mad by playing it constantly like a young child and his favorite Disney movie!,1428710400,,199,4.405405405405405
8356256,4,B0028IJ7VK,"Love the film!  One of the most delightful international farces I've ever seen.  I have an old Laser Disc, but no longer a player for it, so I ordered this DVD.  I found the print used for the DVD to be dark, dirty, sometimes scratchy, not terribly sharp, and it even displayed an occassional video drop out from what I presume was an old analog video master.  The image is 4:3, though for all I know, that may have been the original aspect ratio: imdb doesn't give that spec for this film.  Still, give it a little time, and the film shines through!  So until a better transfer comes along, I'll still recommend this.",1399334400,,618,4.37719298245614
8356257,5,B0028IJ7VK,This is a quirky movie that's a little dated but still relevant and hysterical. A group of Russians that find a magical way from St. Petersburg to Paris. Highly recommended. Thanks to the seller for getting it to me on such short notice!,1390176000,,237,4.534883720930233
8356258,4,B0028IJ7VK,"a sweet charming movie. Window To Paris has everything.  Singing, dancing, jokes, kids, wormhole between an apartment in paris and an apartment in moscow. this movie is a hilarious juxtaposition between gay paris and dark dour moscow living. just keep your eyes on the cat.",1382745600,,273,5.066666666666666
8356259,3,B0028IJ7VK,"I'm wondering if people's complaints about this film are due to the fact that this is a really poor copy of a really good film.  I had a region 4 version that was a much better version (the French version) and probably had the cut out scene another reviewer mentioned.  This one is Russian and has really bad editing and the subtitles are not that great.

Yes, at one time the French version of this film was available in the US on VHS, but like a lot of other films and TV shows: it didn't make the transition to DVD in the US.  The French version was available for a while in region 4, but even that copy if history.  The only versions available are from Russia these days.

And they are two different films in how they are edited and the quality of the print.

I was hopeful that this would be a better copy with widescreen (the version I bought it was, but was 4:3 when I got it).  Not to mention the Western versions I've seen are much better prints.

The story is great, a worm hole that takes people from post-Soviet Russia to Paris.  I'm with the reviewer who like the concept.  Also, it shows how the west offered more promise than post-Soviet Russia.

But, this print is really terrible.  Not sure if it is so bad that it detracts from the story, but it does drop down the quality of the film.

It would be nice if this had been reissued in the US, but I've got the feeling it won't.  It will probably end up on the DVD-R underground if it does.

What a shame.",1382313600,3,1470,4.177935943060498
8356260,5,B0028IJ7VK,a fun movie from the good old days more words more words more words more words more words more words,1380153600,,100,4.05
8356261,5,B0028IJ7VK,"An excellent, light sci-fi fantasy, with mad Russians, meeting with crazy Parisians through a magical portal.  Keen observation of the social differences between a changing Communistical Russian and a very Western Paris.

Technically, this may not be the best made DVD.  The Russian overdubbing of French conversation is distracting because it is very loud.

But the adventures of entrepreneurial Russians in Paris, and bewildered French citizens in St. Petersburg are not to be missed.  Hilarious.",1376524800,,498,5.586666666666667
8356262,5,B0028IJ7VK,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes offbeat comedy, although be warned it does have some adult content.  I have watched it at least five times.  There are some points in the movie that are just plain hilarious, like when Gorokhov is in the TV shop complaining about the fat-head on the screen.  If you have seen the movie ""Ivan Vasiliavich Changes Professions"", AKA ""Back to the Future"" and liked it, you would probably like this movie too.",1373068800,,453,4.6375
8356263,5,B0028IJ7VK,"I saw this movie on TV several years ago.  The concept of being able to travel from Moscow to Paris by going through a special window was a really neat idea.  I have been looking for a copy of the film, and was very happy to finally find it.  The story made me laugh back then, and I still laugh when I watch it now.  Try it.  You'll like it.",1363392000,,342,3.8285714285714287
