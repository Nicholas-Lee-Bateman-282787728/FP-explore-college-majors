859876,4,630434256X,"If ever there was a film crying out to be remade, this is it!  Where is Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, or Robert Rodriguez for this project?  I would cast Salma Hayek as Malintzin (Marina), Mexican Novela star Andres Garcia as Cortez, find a role for Cuban actor Cesar Evora, and film the whole thing in Spanish and Nahuatl.  Rather than focus on Tyrone Power's Diego de Vargas, I might select Malintzin's earlier life in Tabasco and perhaps that of Cortez in Spain and or Cuba.  Given the recent rise of long films (LOTR), historic period epics (Titanic & Gladiator), and subtitled antique language films (Passion of the Christ), this seems more possible than ever.  This is one of the most magnificent stories in human history, and could certainly make one of the greatest films ever as well.
Back to this feature, I was very impressed that it was filmed in Mexico, had fairly good attention to detail on historic costumes, and the Mexica were actually speaking the Aztec language of Nahuatl.  I liked the sequence with the Inquisition (showed that Europe was barbarous as well), and loved the Spanish guitar scene, although it could have used a powerful Mexica dance (climaxed by human sacrifice, of course!).  The beating drums were perfect for mood, growing stronger as they moved closer and closer to the heart of Mexico.  The most disappointing part is when the film ends just where it should have gotten good, with the Lago Texcoco and the magnificent floating city of Tenochtitlan in the distance.  Mr. Spielberg, are you taking notes???",1078790400,7,1547,4.874045801526718

This HUGE 1947 classic (Tyrone's second postwar role after The Razor's Edge and his first in Technicolor since Crash Dive) was filmed gorgeously on location in Mexico in some of the best Technicolor ever, Tyrone co-stars with future Niagara co-star Jean Peters (her first role), Cesar Romero as Cortez, Lee J. Cobb and many others! It was the Titanic of its day with its huge 5 million dollar budget, and was an enormous box-office success.

Power proves his loyalty to Cortez and regains his social status, while getting revenge on the Robespierre-like bad-guy who chased him across the Atlantic.  The uncritical glorification of the Conquistador's slaughter of the native people is troublesome, but the film itself moves at a pretty healthy clip, and is an enjoyable, if quite conventional adventure film, taken on its own terms.",1062806400,6,573,5.085106382978723

Notice that the film credits include an acknowledgement to the Mexican Government for their advice and cooperation in the reenactment of historical sequences. Near Jaen, Spain, in the year 1518, young nobleman Pedro de Vargas is riding through the countryside when he encounters Diego de Silva in pursuit of a runaway slave. Pedro offers to help search for the runaway, and while scouring the hills, he is attacked by the slave, Coatl. As soon as Coatl recognises Pedro as an old friend, however, he desists, then shows Pedro she scars he bears from the cruel de Silva's whip and declares that he would choose death over surrender...In December of 1944, 2Oth Century Fox purchased Samuel Shellabarger's novel for an astonishing 1OO grand. Originally, Linda Darnell was to have been Cantana & Fredric March Cortez. The shooting schedule lasted over three months, 83 of those days were spent shooting on location in Mexico. Nearly 2O,OOO native Mexican and Indian extras were used in the crowd scenes.

859880,5,630434256X,"I remember seeing ""Captain From Castile"" as a young boy on our B/W TV set with a 12"" screen. My Dad had read the book years before and was as excited as I to see the movie in our home. The film captured all the romance, adventure, and swashbuckling drama that I loved then, and still love as a man in my 60s. Since then, I've seen this film many times and have read extensively about the Conquest of Mexico and found much of the movie to be historically accurate with regard to the conquistadors confrontation with the Mejica (i.e., Aztecs), the indigenous people who built the city of Tenochtitlan. Samuel Shellabarger's novel is more exciting to read, of course, especially the ""Noche Triste"" chapter, which was not in the movie, but I feel that the film should also be enjoyed as pure entertainment. It brings out the boy in me every time. I wish my Dad was still alive to enjoy seeing Tyrone Power and Jean Peters follow Cesar Romero's Cortes on his ""conquest.""

It would be wonderful to be able to see a mini-series of CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE filmed in the same cinematic style as the HBO/BBC collaboration on the made-for-TV series ROME. There were so many parts to the original novel, which ran over 500 pages, that it would have to be shot in segments. Of course, the PC crowd would have apoplexy if it followed Shellabarger's storyline, as tolerance of other people's culture and religious beliefs wasn't in vogue during the 16th century.",1010534400,33,1444,4.618677042801556
859881,4,630434256X,"Please allow me to differ with the gentleman from Mexico City who trashed this movie in his biased review.  I have studied Spanish, regularly watch Spanish television, and HAVE READ many books about pre-columbian Mexico and it's Conquest by Cortez and his gang of adventurers.  This movie was shot largely on location IN MEXICO and I only spotted a few minor historical errors.  It is a GREAT movie, as good as Tyrone Power's ""Zorro"" or his ""Black Rose"".  If anything, this movie glosses over the savagery and barbarism of the rulers of Mexico City and their priests who engaged in human sacrifice and cannibalism every day.  There was no exhibition of this in this movie except at the very end we see a temple with blood splattered steps.  The modern, politically correct idea that the evil white men came and stole the country from the native Mexicans has only been around for about two hundred years.  For three hundred years before that the vast masses of native Mexicans never felt that way at all.  The rulers of Mexico City terrorized the native peoples, were widely hated, and, in fact, at the time of the fall of Mexico City there were more native Mexicans fighting on the side of Cortez and the Spanish than there were fighting for the Mexicans.  These are historical facts that are ignored in today's political climate.  Cesar Romero makes a GREAT Hernando Cortez.  He resembles him physically and captures his robustness, daring, great charisma, and charm as he leads the tiny expedition across Mexico, ""Beautiful Mexico"", from the tropics to the highlands to Mexico City itself at the end of the great causeway on the islands in the lake in the valley of Mexico, where you can even see the volcanos smoking in the background.

860028,4,630434256X,"Tyrone Power, back from service as a Marine pilot, (many of the movie industries major 'names' went into Armed Forces during WWII, mostly in the Special Services Divison.  But some, Power, James Stewart and Clark Gable, and others, SERVED) headlines this very well done movie.  A Castilan nobleman and his family (Power) runs afoul of the Inquistion and its 'enforcement arm' the 'Santa Hermandad' and Power is forced to flee Spain which he does, joining Hernado Cortez's expedition to Mexico.  Cortez is not highly regarded today of course, particularly in Mexico, and Caesar Romero's portryal of him does show some of conqueror's less admirable traits.  Lee J. Cobb also has a good role as Power's troubled friend, who has also fled to the expeidtion to avoid pursuit. And watch for Jay Silverheels, TV's 'Tonto' of ""The Lone Ranger' series, in his small (uncredited) role as the Indian slave who escapes Power's enemy only to turn up later as an Aztec nobleman.  Special mention must be made of Jean Peters.  This was her first role, and she does an excellent job with it, with her beauty easily translating to the camera.  It's easy to see why she caught her future husband's Howard Hughes, eye.

Tyrone Power plays a Spanish nobleman forced by persecution to enlist in the expedition of Cortez (Cesar Romero) to Mexico. Some things are done right here, including the literate script, but the tame Hollywood approach to a controversial colonization leeches the story of excitement. While minor characters like a Franciscan friar hint at some of the deeper historical themes, there's little red meat here. Well-staged, the film is nevertheless insubstantial and downright dull in many places, failing to thrill even on the level of ""The Vikings"" (1958) and other minor efforts from this genre. In any event, the DVD comes with some nice extra features and a sleeve of movie stills, giving it a classic packaging. Unless you're a fan of this actor and you catch the film on TV, or you're curious to see a major movie on this subject, I would pass on this one.",1430524800,,955,4.937888198757764

If it had been made a few years later, the orchestra would have been recorded using a superior technology (called by some back then: Hi Fi). The musical score is the power of the picture. Conquest not only had chariots it has legs - (played at every USC Football Game). Finally, I'm puzzled by those reviews that called this an action picture. I think the action was very subdued by today's standards and even in 1947 wasn't pushing the edge of any envelope.",1409702400,2,599,4.454545454545454

860178,2,630434256X,"This is an entertaining melodrama, but a very very poor epic, and an epic is what it is supposed to be. We have the amazing story of Cortez and the conquest of Mexico as a backdrop. 500 Spanish ruffians versus a vast pagan empire of blood sacrifice. Do we get incredible battle scenes with thousands of Aztecs battling the conquistadors? No. Instead we get a few little brawls more appropriate to the story of a street thug than a Captain From Castile.

The ENTIRE LIST of action sequences in this film are as follows: Power fighting a couple of thugs and their dogs over Jean Peters' laundry, Power and his family briefly trying to resist some guards, A brief rapier duel between Power and the villain in a dungeon, Power disarming his drunken friend, and a brawl against some mutineers. That's it. Not ONE battle in a film about the conquest of Mexico. It ends just as they are approaching Tenochtitlan. We don't even meet Montezuma. There is very, very little significance placed on the Conquest of Mexico.

There are a couple of nice epic scenes of Cortez's army on the march, but all in all what a waste.

Jean Peters is very attractive as the wench Catana. All the actors did a very good job.

The Aztecs were strange looking with beards and mustaches. They should have made the Mexican extras shave. Aztecs had no facial hair. They were amazed at the hairy faces of the Spaniards.",1347753600,,1387,4.580645161290323

860261,4,630434256X,"Beautiful cinematography and location shooting. How nice to see stunning compositions with real clouds and volcanoes instead of slick, generic CGI! But after more than two hours, disappointing not to really see Tenochtitlan after all that... All we get is a tantalizing screen painting in the distance for one brief shot.

Lots of nice authentic plot points from Bernal Diaz's eyewitness accounts of the expeditions.

But unfortunately, hampered by director Henry King's wish ""not to offend anyone"" and the original author Shellabarger's silly Inquisition insertion. Whereas the only indication we get of the daily horrific  human sacrifices by the Aztecs is a brief final side-shot of one blood stained Aztec temple.

Instead we get moralizing from a noble native that ""perhaps our Gods are quite alike"".

O, really?

 The highest estimate by historians has only 5,000 people executed by the Inquisition IN OVER 350 YEARS !  Total. And many estimates are less.

Contrast that to the Aztecs who killed one in every five children of their subjugated peoples to their gods. One account has up to 20,000 sacrificed in one weekend ""celebration"" of the building of a new temple... Estimates range from 20,000 to 250,000 PER YEAR. Why else would the Tlascalans and other tribes have joined Cortez against their hated Mexican overlords?

This film shows  the malevolence of the Inquisition, but NOT ONE WORD about human sacrifices to Aztec gods. And the screenplay furthermore asks the viewer to accept moral equivalency between the God of ""turn the other cheek"" and the Aztec God who demands real blood from real hearts ripped from real breasts..

Yes, Cortez invaded another country for gold and treasures. Yes, he massacred natives. Yes he was duplicitous towards his own men and towards the Mexicans. Of course that was not right, nor was it Christian. But let's also see the rest of the history, to explain the brutality of the Aztec civilization.

So, even in 1948, Political Correctness, Diversity, and Moral Equivalency triumphed over reality. (Perhaps the Mexican government demanded the excision of sacrifice mention in return for allowing location shooting? Or was it something else besides fidelity to Shellabarger's silly plot? I would hate to think this was yet another instance of Hollywood's Catholic bashing...)

In sum, absolutely stunning production values, but disappointing in it's political slant and censoring of history.",1336867200,4,2437,5.263565891472868

The story does such a good job of synthesizing the actual history of the time period in Spain and in the ""New World"".  It shows the bad and the good relating to the Church (the Inquisition/the benevolent Father Bartolom), the attitudes towards and treatment of women in different social classes ( the working class girl being valued as worth less than a dog/the high class woman regarded almost as divine and being nearly worshipped by the man), the various reasons people went to the ""New World"", the affects of the ""discovery"" of the Americas on the indigenous people (some going from being royalty or high class to being a slave/their culture and religion being all but destroyed), the superstitions of the people at that time, the politial/power struggles between the likes of Cortez and Velasquez, the role of Doa Marina (also known as ""La Malinche"" to some), the attitudes about class/birth when it came to marriage, etc.  My students enjoyed it immemsely!  They watched it in English, but with Spanish subtitles, although it has a Spanish language option (It was too fast for my students, and somewhat annoying).  For the most part the subtitles are an excellent translation.  It is a great example of historical fiction!  Tyrone Powers was quite good in his role, as were Lee J.

860336,3,630434256X,"Following exiled Spaniard Tyrone Power's adventures with Cortez and the Conquistadores in the New World after a jealous rival reports his family to the Inquisition and tortures his young sister to death, Captain From Castile is one of those deceptively lavish swashbucklers that promise more than it ever delivers. Despite a 141-minute running time, a huge budget, a good cast, great locations and one of the greatest scores ever written for any movie, it still feels like it's only just getting started when it suddenly ends - which it is, since the spectacular last half of Samuel Shellabarger's doorstop novel never made the screenplay, let alone the cameras. Yet even without that knowledge, the final sequence feels more like a rousing sequence to lead into an intermission and leave the audience hungry for more rather than a satisfying grand finale in itself. After such a buildup, ending the story before Cortez gets to meet Moctezuma, let alone steals and destroys his kingdom, is a terrible anticlimax, especially since the novel goes on to paint his battles in particularly vivid strokes. It's as if William Wyler decided to end Ben-Hur with his hero thinking it might be an idea to challenge his mortal enemy to a chariot race some day or ending a film about the Titanic long before the iceberg is even sighted.

Rather than sensitivity for the Aztec culture he destroyed, the reason seems to be more dictated more by finances than conscience: having spent a reputed $4.8m on a difficult Mexican shoot in many of the then still fairly inaccessible locations Cortez marched through, spending another $4m wasn't an attractive prospect, especially since both the censors and the Catholic Legion of Decency had made clear they found huge sections of the book unacceptable, necessitating heavy rewrites before it could go into production. As it was, the film failed to recoup its cost, though a more satisfying ending might have improved matters a bit.

Yet as much as the film disappoints on a first viewing, a second time around it's easier to see its strengths and enjoy it as a lavishly produced period melodrama. True, it misses the irony of the hero's road from vengeance to spiritual redemption being found on a purely mercenary quest for riches, but Cesar Romero's Cortez is never presented as anything other than a jovial pirate, pure and simple: the more the Aztecs try to bribe him to go home, the more he gleefully realizes they have to steal if he carries on. The Technicolor photography is certainly handsome and the location work pays off (even providing a real volcanic eruption in the background of the final scene to match one that happened during Cortez' march) even if most of the movie is just a long walk through Mexico with more intrigue than action. Best of all is Alfred Newman's incredible score and its rousing Conquest theme, truly music to conquer the world to that's so stirring that you'll want to give up the day job and conquer a third world country and enslave its population yourself.

The Region 1 NTSC disc has a glorious color transfer with a good selection of extras - audio commentary, featurette on Tyrone Power's Leading Ladies, stills and advertising gallery, original theatrical trailer and an isolated score track for Alfred Newman's superb score.",1241827200,3,3299,4.940540540540541

860340,5,630434256X,"I'm an avid reader and, in most cases, the rendering of a book into film leaves much to be desired.  Generally speaking, the movie is far weaker than the novel.  There are numerous reasons for this but one of the reasons is that the reader can use his imagination--read between the lines--whereas a movie is ""in your face"" offerring few opportunities for mental imagery.

This movie is, in my opinion, a real exception.  As much as I love the novel, ""Captain from Castile"", I think the screen play is better.  The writers decided to emphasize the romance between Pedro and Catana and it was the right decision.  Part of the reason for this was probably financial.  Even in 1948 it would have cost a great fortune to reconstruct great Aztec edifices and assemble Indian armies of thousands.  The writers opted for the less expensive option of a few small structures and a beautiful love story.

The scene where Catana takes her knife...  Well, if you haven't seen the film, I won't spoil it.

I don't doubt it is relatively accurate in historical fact. The movie is colorful, buoyant, and follows the life of one man, Pedro de Vargas, played by Power. Mostly filmed in beautiful regions of Mexico, it has good camera work. Good directing, and a good sprinkling character development as well. In the beginning we see his wealthy family in Spain and then it being crushed by the Spanish Inquisition. It follows the mother and fathers escape to Italy while Pedro, with two friends along to help him, head for the coast. They join Cortez in the fleet heading for the Indies and a assault on the indians of Mexico.

It would have required a film of twice the length -- i.e., over four hours -- to even approach that.

For entertainment value, however, this is a great movie.  Tyrone Power is at his handsome best (not a lot of swashbuckling here), Lee J. Cobb gives, as usual, an excellent performance, and John Sutton, as the local leader of the inquisition in Caen, Spain, plays the villainous Diego de Silva without quite going over the top.  Jean Peters makes a lovely Catana Peres, and Cesar Romero (""By my beard, Gentlemen"") gives his performance of Hernan Cortes an air of gung-ho conqueror that plays well in this version of the Spanish invasion of Mexico.

However, epic adventure novels had become very prominent on the NY Times BestSeller list, and Captain From Castile was at the top of the lists. Fox took a chance on their fading star and gave him a first-rate production of a story which suited him to perfection. Tyrone still looked good, before his lifestyle and alcohol had taken their inevitable tolls.

This is a story incorporating the Spanish Inquisition, murder, flight to the Americas to aid Cortez' conquest of Mexico, passionate love, and all in exquisite Technicolor. Oddly, Fox followed up the popularity of CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE with another best-seller with Tyrone Power, and filmed PRINCE OF FOXES in black and white!  Of course it bombed.

860380,5,630434256X,"FINALLY on DVD. First off, one of my favorite movies. Ever. Fabulous color, gorgeous leading players, and a lush Alfred Newman score.

While I hate the usual ""As a..."" to ""justify"" a comment, I must say that, as a Mexican American, it is nice to enjoy both a rousing swashbuckler that accurately represents--aside from the usual dramatic license re love interests, etc.--what happened. The ""primary source"" material is Father Bernal Diaz de Castillo who accompanied the Cortez expedition. I like to think the Thomas Gomez character is based upon him. ""It's the Romantic In Me"" [thank you, Inspector Reynod]. Additionally, the woman referred to as ""Dona Maria"" is dead-on accurate; she did exist, and went on to bear Hernan Cortez a child. Without her, it is doubtful that Cortez could have made the progress he did. She saved his life, and those of the Spanish troops, more than once by uncovering plots in the kitches of their hosts, etc.

Finally, I sadly read one review here by a proud Spaniard who seems unable to recognize the equivalent pride of we who boast of Mexican ancestry--my family from Aguas Calientes in Mexico. For, in so doing, we can legitimately point to our Spanish blood with almost as much pride as we do our Indian. This site is a happy place for sharing our reviews; I therefore toss to my Spanish counterpart a rose of friendship in a spirit one would ordinarilly associate with our friends from the Spanish Penninsula.

860381,4,630434256X,"It's a shame that 20th Century Fox has yet to have released DVD editions of many of the films of the studio's biggest star, Tyrone Power. Almost impossibly handsome, enormously popular, and with excellent acting credentials, Power nearly singlehandedly kept the studio solvent in the traumatic transition years following WWII, with costume epics like ""Captain from Castile"" showcasing his strengths.

""Castile"" echoes Power's earlier films, ""The Mark of Zorro"" and ""Son of Fury"", as again he plays a gallant standing against an arrogant aristocratic class, but this time he runs afoul of the Inquisition, and must flee Spain to re-establish his wealth and reputation, accompanied by loyal friend Lee J. Cobb, and a servant girl who secretly adores him (Jean Peters, in one of her best performances). Recruited into the service of the charismatic Hernando Cortez (Cesar Romero, who nearly steals the film), it's off to Aztlan (Mexico, today) with a small army to face the overwhelming but naive Aztec civilization.

While the film frequently drifts into melodrama, shooting on location in Mexico (with the permission and support of the Mexican government), in glorious Technicolor, gives even the most mundane moments a sense of spectacle, and the cast is in top form. Worth singling out is a terrific supporting performance by Thomas Gomez, as a soldier/priest who dispenses common sense as well as religion, and helps Power realize that the woman he truly loves is not on a balcony, in Spain, but beside him, as they march towards their destiny.

Two aspects of the film deserve special recognition; Alfred Newman's score, featuring the vaulting 'Conquest' march, is one of the finest of his long career, and is even more popular today than when the film was released; and Arthur E. Arling and Charles G. Clarke's cinematography is truly magnificent, particularly in the breathtaking finale, as Cortez' forces proudly march across a broad plain, with active volcanoes in the backround. Never has going 'on location' been more justified, as the image is unforgettable!

If any 'Powers that Be' are reading this review, PLEASE offer this film on DVD, soon! And while you're at it, consider Power's other great films of the 40s and 50s; he deserves to be 'rediscovered' by audiences, today...",1121126400,64,2290,5.164420485175202

The folks who control such things really ought to put this wonderful film out on DVD now!  It is amazing to me how great films such as this languish in vaults, and yet we see piles of worthless junk on DVD counters in every store.

860383,4,630434256X,"Not a great film but one of those films I grew up with and have a great deal of affection for. A piece of pure postwar escapism based on a best-selling novel (or part of it anyway), it has adventure, romance, action, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Cortes expedition to conquer the Aztecs - a historical period sadly neglected by Hollywood. No doubt many of the film's attitudes would be considered politically incorrect today but, at the time, this was entertainment on a grand scale.

Tyrone Power plays the title role (at another studio, it could just as easily have been Errol Flynn) and it is one of the better performances from this star who was not always very animated. But here he is properly noble or romantic or swashbuckling as the occasion demands. Almost acting him off the screen is the fiery and luscious Jean Peters as a passionate gypsy girl. It is worth watching the film for her alone. The rest of the casting ranges from adequate to strange - Lee J Cobb in particular looks lost in a period piece. Cesar Romero makes a larger than life Cortes with a equally large grin.

The style of the film is colorful, well-paced and workmanlike without being burdened with a surfeit of imagination. The early scenes set in Spain look like standard Hollywood back lot/plywood sets stuff. But once the action shifts to Mexico - and this part of the film, unusually for the time, was made on location - it becomes a totally different and visually impressive movie. It really does feel like a New World.

Adding immeasurably to the atmosphere is the music of Alfred Newman - one of the finest scores for a film of this type ever composed. The stirring march from the film's finale - Conquest - has become famous in its own right. But the rest of the score is just as good, especially the haunting Catana love theme - so unlike the usual Hollywood love music and so perfectly appropriate to the mood of this film. For anyone not in love with Jean Peters, Newman's music is another good reason for seeing this picture.

The storyline is fairly routine with the usual predictable complications and one or two nice twists. It doesn't always make sense. Jay Silverheels (TV's Tonto) plays an Indian who, at the beginning of the film, escapes from slavery in Spain and is helped by Tyrone Power. Later, he re-appears in Mexico, re-established as a tribal chief. But I have never been able to figure out how he got there - it's not like there was a regular transatlantic passenger service in those days. But the plot rattles along at a good enough rate so that you don't worry too much about such things.

A bigger budget, a better supporting cast, a more creative director (like, say, Michael Curtiz) and Captain From Castile might have been a great film - maybe even a classic. As it is, it's still pretty good entertainment and an enjoyable example of the type of film that Hollywood used to make all the time but seems to have lost the knack for. I just hope Captain From Castile eventually comes out on DVD in a restored version in all its original glory. Hint, hint...",1093392000,24,3073,4.58

Unfortunately, the first half or so of the film dissolves into standard Hollywood romantic pablum while simultaneously gutting the same portion of the novel from which it is derived.  The film doesn't really take off until it gets to Mexico, where a vibrantly youthful Cesar Romero puts some life into Hernando Cortez, PC be damned, and the Aztecs show up.  CAPTAIN ends where the film could well have begun, with Cortez marching on the Aztec capital and where the novel embarks on some of its finest, most descriptive action.

If you can get past the opening half, with its familial machinations and (thanks to the incessant intercession of the Hays Office) bowdlerized Inquisition, the rest is worth seeing for the locations, costumes, and some good performances from Romero, Tyrone Power, Lee J. Cobb, and 20-year old Jean Peters.  All of which is, to paraphrase Oscar Levant's comment on the score for King Kong, ""a visual accompaniment to (Alfred Newman's) music"".

Power brings his usual limited palette of acting nuances - Romero is surprising effective as the ambitious but sympathetic Cortez - silent screen latin lover Antonio Moreno makes a strong impression as Pedro de Vargas' father - and just-out-of-college Jean Peters (virtually without any type of acting experience) has surprising assurance & skill in her film debut
