1227071,5,B00000IPHJ,"Rehearsal for a Murder is from the golden age of the 70's mysteries of tv.  For those of us who were there it seemed like there was a good mystery every week or a mystery series that was great,i.e. Banacek.  The story is set on a stage and the actors are called to read for a new play. However the script is to find out who killed the playwright's girlfriend.  Each actor has a motive and there is a cop on hand to keep people from leaving till the play is done.  No more about the story because any more and the movie is ruined. Now watching it today the actors seem too old for some of the parts,i.e. Robert Preston as the lover/playwright.  The movie takes its time on some sceens and there is very little action. Think of this as a mind game, where the viewer has to listen for the clues.  The clues are given to you but in a very subtle manner.  I grew up to be a play director and I have done this story as a play.  As a play it moves faster, but the story still stands up.  If you are the generation that grew up on action, action, and little story then runaway from this movie.",1227398400,8,1085,4.0327102803738315
1227072,3,B00000IPHJ,"Maybe it is not the Best Movie in the World, but I found it enjoyable, especially for the final twist. I think it was a play first and it shows: not much imagination in the scenes, a rather drab setting. But still enjoyable.",1157587200,,224,4.232558139534884
1227073,5,B00000IPHJ,"This is one of the best TV mysteries I've ever seen. Non-mystery fans may consider the setup preposterous, but the directive ""buy the premise, buy the bit"" applies here. It wasn't impressive till the end, then all became clear. If you love Levinson & Link mysteries, like the movie Murder By Natural Causes, or the TV serieses (plural?) Columbo or Columbo's descendant Murder She Wrote, you'll enjoy the twists in the plot.

1227074,1,B00000IPHJ,"Poor Robert Preston. We understand that everyone needs to earn a living, but to earn it in such a fetid fashion is unforgivable. We shouldn't blame the poor music man ... the plot is inane, the writing pedestrian and the direction is stiffer than a Viagra test room. (You know something is very wrong when even the folks who wrote the packaging copy refer to the flick's co-star Lynn Redgrave as ""Vanessa Redgrave."" Poor Lynn is engaged to poor Robert. She ""commits suicide"" on the very the night she makes her Broadway debut ... in a show he wrote. Preston is out to prove it was murder, and gathers all the possibilites in an empty theater ... sort of ""The Last of Sheila"" meets ""And Then There Were None."" The careers of co-stars William Daniels, Patrick Macnee and Jeff Goldlbum managed to survive this horror. This film doesn't. Close the curtain. Now!",1044748800,,857,4.644736842105263

1227167,5,B00000IPHJ,"One of the reasons I love this 1985 DVD is that I sang in the chorus of Verdi's ""Requiem""  while still in college, and it was a wonderful, life-affirming experience.  In ""Lux Aeterna"" we see Claudio Abbado rehearsing the La Scala chorus and orchestra through much of this requiem mass, that was composed in 1874 by Giuseppe Verdi for the first anniversary of the poet Alessandro Manzoni's death.  I still get tears in my eyes while watching this  'Requiem,' which  has been called ""Verdi's greatest opera.""

According to the director, Norbert Beilharz, who I believe does the voice-over in German, ""this is a film about Guiseppe Verdi and a film about ephemerality, variations of ephemerality in musical rehearsals, and in the symbols of life, man and the joy of theatre and music, advertising and consumerism, the deceased--images of cemeteries with people that seem to be alive, water and stone.""

Beilharz works in advertising and consumerism with shots of billboards and bejeweled women drinking champagne.  An occasional tour of cemetery statuary and water running over stone do not impinge too freakishly on the main action of this DVD.

Four of the soloists:  Lucia Valentini-Terrani (contralto), Samuel Ramey (bass), Cecilia Gasdia (soprano), and Chris Merritt (tenor) also sang in Rossini's ""Maometto II"" at the 1985 Pesaro Festival.  The other two soloists on this DVD are Montserrat Caball (soprano) and Peter Dvorsky (tenor).

Samuel Ramey was already making a name for himself in Europe as the finest Rossinian bass of the century, and here he proves himself equally at home with Verdi.  It is thrilling to watch and listen to Claudio Abbado interacting with Ramey while they are working on the 'Mors stupebit,' both in the piano room and later with the orchestra.

The late Italian contralto, Lucia Valentini-Terrani sings with her heart in her eyes, totally devoted to the music, although she lost her concentration once, and grinned when  Montserrat Caball tripped over a difficult passage beside her.  Caball even had Abbado laughing at one point.  He had to promise not to watch her after she repeatedly flubbed one of her entrances.  She was a joy to listen to, though.  Her beautiful pianissimos seemed to float on forever.

The La Scala chorus and orchestra perform with unashamed theatricality under the baton of Claudio Abbado.  If you are at all interested in this glorious piece of music, I think you'll enjoy this DVD.  I watch it with the English subtitles.",1425168000,,2484,5.051597051597051

The blur distracted from an engaging story, but there's nothing that can be done about that.  This was a whodunnit with a twist that I didn't see coming.  I new there was a twist, but had become so accustomed to the lazy and repetitive attempts in recent movies (main character is already dead, or is really the crazy one, etc.) that I was caught off guard by a genuine cerebral turn of events.

1227203,4,B00000IPHJ,"I'm rating this a four, not because it deserves to be that high in comparison to every movie ever, but because my expectations after watching the first 5 minutes were totally revised by the end of the story.

The plot is straightforward - though an actress dies in an apparent suicide after a poorly-received opening night, her fiancee, the playwright, brings together the same people a year later who he believes may have murdered her. Using the transparent excuse of a ""play"", he forces each of them to ""act their part"", exposing their secret motives and making them all very nervous until the killer is unmasked.

The story drags in parts, as each person is forced to play their unattractive part, and as they inevitably resist and must be forced to go forward. This was clearly made-for-TV, and suffers in parts from scenes that are a bit long in getting to the commercial break. However, the ending was so unexpected and so well done, that I was both astonished and impressed - in fact, I got tears in my eyes as I realized who the playwright's friends really are, and how much they have done to help him.

1227204,4,B00000IPHJ,"That's the title that writer-producers Richard Levinson and William Link wanted to use for this made-for-TV movie, but the suits at CBS thought it too clever. Nowadays CBS could use some smarts, but I digress. As many readers will know, Levinson and Link are best known as the creators, original producers, and sometimes scenarists of ""Columbo."" This nifty little mystery is not their finest effort, but it's very good with a top-notch cast. in a straight dramatic role Robert Preston is the maypole around whom everyone else dances; Lynn Redgrave appears as his dead wife, whom we see in multiple flashbacks, most of which imagine who might have killed her, and why. The rest of the cast--including Patrick Macnee, Jeff Goldblum, and William Daniels--are equally top-notch. That's important: working out of the Christie/Queen tradition, Levinson and Link plotted drawing-room think-pieces that would be terribly dull if we didn't enjoy the actors so much. If you can accept a tenuous plot-brace, without which their house of cards would collapse, the writers play fair and revel in laying one false trail after another until the final reveal. A cozy entertainment, with a touch of poignance underlined by Billy Goldenberg's music.",1400198400,12,1231,5.222222222222222

1227208,5,B00000IPHJ,"I like mystery movies that are not obvious and you have to think a little bit to workout ""who dunnit?"".  It is even better when you fool the viewer and still make it very logical and not some absurd unfathomable ending.  The movie is set in a different time but still a good story.",1397088000,,281,4.185185185185185
1227209,2,B00000IPHJ,"The movie had a good plot, albeit a little unrealistic.  However, since it was about theatre, the lack of realism didn't bother me.  It also had a nice twist so that even if you thought you knew ""whodunit"" you'd be a bit surprised I believe.  I also like Robert Preston, but in a way, he's always the ""Music Man"" with a bad hair piece in this movie.  The worst of this experience, though, is that the picture quality and the sound quality were poor.  The movie stopped and started a couple of times, which I find happens often with the amazon movies and tv shows and sometimes they don't ever resume but fortunately that didn't happen this time.  So my two-star rating is more about the viewing experience than the movie itself.",1394668800,,728,4.4772727272727275
1227210,5,B00000IPHJ,"I am studying this movie and the blocking, props etc.  I plan to direct this as a play in the fall of this year at Twin Lakes Playhouse in Mt. Home, Arkansas.",1393804800,,158,3.9375
1227221,3,B00000IPHJ,"I watched this because I am an avid classic murder mystery lover, and the cast intrigued me.  Good plot twist.  Not the best visual quality, but watchable.  For fans of similar era tv mystery movies and shows like Murder She Wrote.",1393459200,,231,4.585365853658536
1227222,4,B00000IPHJ,"A made-for-TV movie (?), how did I miss this in the 80s?  Really quite good, a play within a play, nice little plot. An oh-so-young Jeff Goldblum, and a not-so-young Patrick MacNee, but he always reminds me of The Avengers!",1390867200,,223,4.575
1227223,5,B00000IPHJ,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to give this movie a try.
I have to admit to being a fan of the :Murder she wrote"" ""Columbo"" type genre.  This movie fit right in.
The plot was well played and kept interest until the end.  Would highly recommend.",1388966400,,255,4.291666666666667
1227224,5,B00000IPHJ,very good movie i  had seen it many years ago ...its a good mystery and you will enjoy watching it...i'm glad they  finally put it on video  so you can  enjoy seeing it again...,1385769600,,177,4.117647058823529
1227225,5,B00000IPHJ,This movie was very nice from the beginning to the end. I really enjoyed it and would recommend this one to friends.,1385078400,,116,4.318181818181818
1227226,4,B00000IPHJ,"Mysteries are my thing.  I will watch any mystery at least once.  This one is surprisingly good and keeps you guessing.  The acting is at times very good, at others a little strained.  But considering this is a mystery from the early 80's, I think they do very well.

Someone made a comment about this being a bad venue for Robert Preston.  I thought it was much more challenging for him than he was given credit.

I would watch this again, and would definitely suggest it to anyone who likes a good ""who done it"" that doesn't give away the answer half way through.",1378252800,3,565,4.375
1227227,5,B00000IPHJ,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as TUTM) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair. If Product Details are accurate, the stated 96 minute running time means this is an uncut dub.

.
REHEARSAL FOR MURDER is an excellent TV movie, one in which the central character, a famous playwright (Preston) whose leading lady fianc&eacute;e (Redgrave) died a year earlier, resurfaces after months of exile. He invites actors and others involved in his ill-fated last production to meet him at the same theater where Redgrave's debut night later proved to be her final evening on Earth.

Preston is convinced that Redgrave's death wasn't a suicide and that one of these people is the killer. He's written scenarios for each to perform while the others observe. This teleplay could easily be a real stage show-- it's that good! Highest recommendation.

1227231,1,B00000IPHJ,"I received the movie on time, but when I put it on, the color was very, very dark and the picture was squashed from top to bottom with the actors all looking about four feel tall.  The quality of the DVD was terrible.  It is a little known movie so I'm sure there aren't that many versions of it out there, but this one is a waste.  Save your money. If you want to see Robert Preston try something else.",1357689600,,403,4.0125
1227232,5,B00000IPHJ,I saw this on television in the 1980's and always remembered it as an excellent mystery. Watching it again on DVD was a real pleasure. Link and Levinson won the Edgar Award for their teleplay.,1350172800,,192,4.514285714285714

It has been 15 years since I saw it and it is still a fresh and timeless treasure. It is fascinating from the moment Robert Preston first enters the scene until the surprise climax. WELL DONE! HIGHYLY RECOMMENDED!",1266624000,4,362,4.338235294117647

7911216,4,B00000IPHJ,"Enjoyable little made for TV movie.  I would say it is in the style of a Miss Jane Marple mystery in that you don't know who the culprit is till the very end.  You literally cannot see the twist coming!  So be ready to be surprised.  You'll recognize a lot of the actors from TV and film, including a very young Jeff Goldblum, Patrick Macnee (known for playing a demonic-type character on the 1970s version of Battlestar Galactica) and Robert Preston on The Music Man fame.  Worth your time if you like a good mystery and have the patience to let it build. Not for you if you only like action films.",1504742400,,599,4.3125

7911218,4,B00000IPHJ,"This is a very enjoyable murder mystery of the type that is rarely made these days.  The creators were Levinson & Link, who were also responsible for ""Columbo"".  Indeed, while watching this made-for-TV movie, I was thinking that it would have fit in very nicely on NBC's Sunday Night Mysteries which included the likes of ""Columbo"", ""Banacek"", ""McMillan & Wife"", and more that I probably do not recall clearly.

As others have noticed, there are some holes in the plot, and I seriously doubt that a jury would convict the killer based on the evidence if he/she brazened it out in a trial, but it's certainly entertaining.  The video quality is terrible, but if you go into not expecting 4K, you'll find a well-made mystery to entertain you.

Recommended.",1499212800,2,754,4.813953488372093
7911219,4,B00000IPHJ,I very much enjoyed this TV-movie.  I've always liked Robert Preston(and the rest of the cast is good also).  I was not expecting the surprise ending.

7911220,2,B00000IPHJ,"Creaky, cliched, slow.  This has some actors who have been good in other things, but not here.  There's not a believable moment or performance, and the pace is so ponderous that there's no chance to get caught up in the plot.  I give mysteries the benefit of the doubt because I think they're more of a fun gadget than an artful invention--but this one is not worth the time.",1493510400,,375,4.405797101449275
