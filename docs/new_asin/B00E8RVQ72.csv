8602717,3,B00E8RVQ72,"Three DVDs with behind the scenes extras and loads of trailers. Image quality is standard Full Moon level (if you're a fan, you'll know what I mean).

Seed People is my favorite of the three; it's a fun little monster movie with some inspired, low-budget special effects.

The Oblivion films have their fun moments such as, George Takei as a Jim Beam swilling drunk who says, ""Beam me up Jim"" and Julie Newmar as a saloon owner named Miss Kitty who wears a form fitting, leopard print bodysuit. Overall, it's too self-aware of it's own cuteness, lacks enough action scenes, and the bad puns get old fast.

Three star review because this is the fifth time a Full Moon dvd has arrived from Amazon with a disc scratched up and loose in the case. This is due to the flimsy cases Full Moon packages their discs in.

I understand the releases are budget level and Full Moon tries to keep their production costs down, but out of respect for fans who still buy dvds (instead of downloading them somewhere), FM should use better cases.",1504656000,2,1026,4.559782608695652
8602718,4,B00E8RVQ72,"Full Moon Entertainment is one of those production places that puts out alot of films.  Many B-Rate.  Many good & bad.  But these 3 won't bade counted amoung the bad.  Oblivian 1 & 2 are great send ups of the space opera.  And Seed People is a great low budget ""Pod People"" type film.
  All in all this is a great 3 pack of films.  And well worth the price & viewing",1461369600,,366,3.986111111111111
