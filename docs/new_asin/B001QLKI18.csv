3765606,5,B001QLKI18,my daughter & daughter-in-law saved this to watch together when we all got together in Myrtle Beach- I had recommended it- they LOVED it- they like elderly people so they enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave & the rest of the cast as they turned things around & started to get along with each other- if the whole world could do this- wouldn't it be great?,1251331200,,350,4.484375
3765607,4,B001QLKI18,"Good story with interesting, well-acted characters. Set around the holidays, the performances are strong enough you don't think of it as a Christmas movie. In the beginning, as the plot and character stories develop, its a bit slow; but as the bickering morphs into camaraderie the tempo quickens and the ending wraps-up quickly and makes it all worthwhile. Better than average fare.",1244160000,,383,5.193548387096774
3765608,4,B001QLKI18,"How About You has the feel of a Hallmark movie; and that can be either good or bad. On the bright side, it's got terrific acting and the plot moves along fairly well. The cinematography and the choreography are very professionally done; and the casting is great. On the downside, it feels somewhat sugary-sweet and predictable; and that did disappointment me a little.

When the film starts, we meet Kate Harris (Orla Brady) who runs Woodlane, a home in rural Ireland for people who are elderly and wealthy enough to pay for some pretty nice accommodations and quality care. Unfortunately, as hard as Kate works, there are four residents in particular who are so obstreperous that staff have been going and coming like crazy: these people are former actress and star Georgia Platts (Vanessa Redgrave), Donald Vanston (Joss Ackland) and the somewhat younger sisters Hazel and Heather Nightingale (Imelda Staunton and Brenda Fricker). Kate even gets warnings from her colleagues that she got to find staff who will stay despite the behavior of these residents; and things only worsen when Kate's dropout and somewhat whimsical younger sister Ellie (Hayley Atwell) comes to Kate to ask for work.

At first Kate refuses to give Ellie a job; but Kate does need extra staff and so she relents. And, predictably, Ellie keeps annoying the remaining staff by coming in at all hours of the night and sleeping way past breakfast time--this leaves the morning nurse alone for a huge and demanding breakfast crowd. Moreover, Ellie is caught giving marijuana to Alice (Joan O'Hara), a dying resident who wants some relief from her emotional and physical pain. Ellie has a heart of gold, really, but Kate is so caught up in the rules that Kate just can't see it.

When their mother has a sudden stroke, Kate and Ellie have a crisis. Someone must go to be with their mother; and Kate insists on going without any advance notice to Ellie. This means Ellie will be all on her own for Christmas with the four most difficult residents who ever graced Woodlane.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Is Kate able to trust Ellie or does she bring in more help? What about Georgia, Donald, Hazel and Heather--they are bound to test Ellie something awful; how will Ellie stand up to their testing her? At first Ellie complies; but how long will it be before there's a nasty confrontation? And why is it that Heather won't allow Hazel to ever read their mail? Watch and find out!

How About You features great acting and the artistry is very well done; but the sugary sweet aftertaste is definitely a bit too sugary sweet to completely satisfy me. However, if you want a ""feel-good"" movie; this would be a great choice. It's relatively lighthearted and there's nothing wrong with that. I also recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie.",1243296000,,2830,4.7673469387755105
3765609,5,B001QLKI18,"This movie is another example of whether it's BBC Victorian dramas or independent UK productions such as this movie one finds the acting, directing, music, script and settings superb. As a counterpoint, why America produces so many junk movies with so much money is a mystery. The pace of the movie builds and is perfect for the transitions that take place within the retirement home from individuals moving selfishly nowhere toward becoming an active and compassionate family. The only criticism worth mentioning is the introduction of a bit too much marijuana to these retirees - a bit far-fetched but a nice touch anyway. If you know someone facing the retirement home stage of life you will find this an entertaining movie.",1242864000,,727,5.016528925619835
3765610,3,B001QLKI18,"I enjoyed this amusing UK production and recommend it to those who appreciate the acting of Vanessa Redgrave and such solid performers as Joss Ackland, Brenda Fricker and Imelda Staunton.

At first, the story seemed a bit disjointed, but, upon further reflection, I found the first and last parts of the story to be revealing about the 2 main characters, Kate and Ellie.  The first part of the movie focused mostly on the relationship between sisters Kate (Orla Brady), the owner of a rural home for seniors, and young, rebellious Ellie (Hayley Atwell).  Kate has worked hard to establish her ""home"" as an efficient, reputable place for seniors to live.  Ellie has lived in more of a free-spirited way.

While the sisters portray rather convincingly that they have a long-standing bond between them, naturally their opposite lifestyles and values lead to conflicts.  Kate gives her sister a chance to earn some much needed income by working at the senior-living home, but they find themselves at odds about how some of the more difficult residents should be treated, especially the 4 surly characters played by Redgrave, Ackland, Fricker and Staunton, and that leads to some of the more humorous scenes in this steady paced movie.

Some viewers might consider the pace of the movie to be too slow, but I did not.  Rather it seemed that the first part helped to establish the personas of the main characters and to prepare viewers for what was to come in the rest of the story.  In all fairness, the film's pace seems to help better understand the natures of the characters, but I think that could have been done more quickly.

The rest of the movie had a decidedly more upbeat tone and pace to it and provided several light-hearted, humorous scenes.  Viewers get to see and enjoy some of Ellie's better qualities as she establishes a very different atmosphere and relationship with the 4 troublesome residents entrusted to her care during a sudden, unexpected leave of absence by Kate during the Christmas holidays.

That being said I did think the movie would have been more enjoyable if a few things had been done differently by the director and/or screenwriter.  Kate's sudden leave of absence seemed to have been treated almost superficially.  It just seemed to lack emotional impact, especially on the more ""conscientious"" Kate.  I do not consider this to be a serious ""flaw"".  In fact, it might underscore the main emphasis of the story to be about Kate's and Ellie's differences and their decidedly different influence on the residents.

Ellie's decision to move on in her life and part company from Kate at the end of the story again seemed a bit too abrupt to me.  Perhaps the writer and director preferred to emphasize Ellie as the free spirit who derives as much or more enjoyment from the ""fruits"" of spontaneity and forthrightness and to further differentiate her character from Kate's as the more staid and emotionally involved with her work and the residents of the home.

The only part of the story that seemed to add little to the story was the persistent emphasis on smoking dope -- not only by the rebellious Ellie but also as a way of her encouraging the seniors to ease their struggles with aging, alienation and even impending death.  This aspect of the story did not lessen my overall enjoyment of the movie, but I regard it as a  simplistic and frivolous dimension to these more existential life issues.

All in all, I give this production 3.5 stars out of 5.",1240617600,22,3483,4.798994974874372

3765656,2,B001QLKI18,"I never imagined I'd see Vanessa Redgrave give a bad performance, but then I never would have imagined she'd end her career in stupid movies like How About You. What a waste of some great actors.

The story is achingly maudlin and predictable, and the dialog is corny and phony - like a sappy Lifetime TV movie larded with profanity, in which consuming cannabis is the magical solution to every problem. It's stupid.

And the song! I never hated ""How About You?"" until I had it force-fed to me by this movie. Sung in its entirety first by Bobby Darin over the opening credits, THEN by Redgrave in a pub; a brief ragtime version by the young sisters on a piano; and again by Redgrave and an unseen chorus at the finale. That's more than enough for a lifetime.

The director is a moron. He not only has the talent and esthetic sensibility of a soap opera hack (every stupid point he is determined to get across has to be repeated ad nauseam, to make absolutely sure that NOBODY will NOT get it), but has some kind of fetish for things drifting down out of the sky.

He has snow falling while everything is green (including the ground, where the snow evidently melts on contact, although it sits forever on actors' hair) and dead leaves drifting thickly down at Christmas-time although there's absolutely no wind to pluck them off the trees. That does not happen except in this idiot director's imagination. Trite and heavyhanded metaphors for death, maybe? Who knows. Or cares.

This dumb, irritating movie is only for folks who are either fascinated or terrified by death. People get old, they fall apart, and then they die. So what? It happens to everybody. It's happening to me now. It's perfectly natural and good, except to people in strong denial, who believe if they do everything the doctors tell them to do THEY won't die; which, of course, is a lie.

So I advise skipping this stupid movie, unless you have a death fetish that won't allow you such freedom. The only good thing about it is getting to LOOK at Redgrave, who gets more beautiful with each passing year. What a marvel she is! If only she hadn't had to say such relentlessly stupid lines she single-handedly would have made this movie worth watching.",1390953600,,2219,4.60506329113924

3765687,5,B001QLKI18,"This movie is a gem! The writing is great and the production values are superb but it is the gist of the story that is so awesome.

We will all be there at some time in our lives so it is really important to have some grounding in what it will be like to live into one's ""golden"" years. The movie ""Quartet"" is another story along similar lines but it does focus more on the past professional lives of the characters rather than being in the ""present moment"", as portrayed by ""How About You"", of what it is like to grow older and to have wonderful memories and some regrets.

The actors do a masterful job with Vanessa Redgrave sort of ""wafting"" above the rest in her role of the past ""star"".

Perhaps this movie could be required viewing for anyone (especially family members), dealing with life in it's entirety.

Highly recommended for the whole family.

Great job!",1388966400,,867,4.462025316455696

3765715,3,B001QLKI18,"Kate Harris (Orla Brady) runs a retirement home for those who can afford to pay for a certain level of service, and proximity to medically trained staff, in the elegance of a former manor home in Ireland.  Things aren't going as well as planned though, because her four core tenants, all social misfits, terrorize everyone else with their rudeness and bad behavior, so more folks are checking out, than checking in these days.  Then, Kate's younger sister Ellie (Hayley Atwell) comes to stay with her, to earn money, with minimal expenses, so she can take off with her friends on a round the world jaunt.  Ellie isn't a good mix in a home of cranky and often demanding old codgers, but she hangs on, and a year later (as once again everyone takes off on their holiday family visits) their mother has a stroke.  Since Ellie and her don't get along, it's decided (by Kate) that Kate will take a risk and leave the home (to look in on Mom), and the Terrible Four---the only guests who never leave----with Ellie, and so Ellie finds herself alone for the holidays in an near empty manor house, with no staff, and four miserable old codgers.

Things don't go well.

The phone rings at one in the morning only to have Vanessa Redgrave, playing an arrogant, bitterly old, former show girl, having a problem with her remote, a pretense for having Ellie mix her two martinis so she won't have to get out of her chair.  At 5, the phone rings again with a breakfast order from Mr. Vanston (Joss Ackland) which he says he always gets at 6, when breakfast is posted for 8.  Finally, having quite enough, Ellie summons them all to the dining hall, and, reading them the riot act, announces that they'll all have Christmas dinner at the same table, as a family.  Having been thus confronted, they all begin to make an effort to grow up and behave, and prepare for Christmas.

Very simple, very sweet, and very little tension.  At one point we find out that, of the two sisters who live at the manor, one had a child as a young girl, but her father had it given to nuns.  The by now grown up young man has been looking for her, but because her sister was afraid of losing her, she hid the mail, until one letter from him got delivered by mistake, by Ellie.  Naturally, he's going to show up at Christmas dinner, as a surprise!  No, actually, he never shows up at all.  There are several instances where plot threads are introduced, woven in for a length or two, and then forgotten.  The ending is the worst of all, where after one sister-to-sister tete a tete, with a joint, the movie closes.  It's as if the writers got bored and everyone else left early that day.

And about those joints...  (but don't get the wrong idea, this isn't a movie about drugs, alcohol is still the prime escape vehicle among the cast)

Old Marijuana used to be rolled in fairly thin joints because we never had the money to smoke enough to get really, really high.  New Marijuana is so powerful just one toke can send you to woo hoo ville for hours.  Joints?  These aren't the twisted at each end bogies, but torchieres---narrow at the mouth end, and twice as wide at the fire end, which is open, running from 1/4"" at the mouth to 1/2""inch at the fire.  Is this supposed to be modern Marijuana?  I've never, in forty years, seen a joint that massive, and what's the point with New Pot?

So, unlike the ""Most Exotic Marigold Hotel"" which features older actors in starring roles, or ""Waking Ned Devine"" which has an older cast as well, this movie hasn't got much of a story because what tension there is is kept so tightly restrained that nothing really happens.  There are a few nice moments, and some chuckles, but mostly it's a quiet little film full of old people and one young woman.  That still leaves an entertaining way to pass the time in front of the TV, but honestly, it could have been so much better.",1388275200,,3874,4.449008498583569

This is a great movie from the UK that is beautifully filmed as well as acted with some solid performances.  A young, college-aged girl drops out of college to go work at her sister's elderly care facility which is in financial trouble because of 4 very mean residents who run the staff and other residents away.  She has a boyfriend and wants to save up money to go on a great vacation with him.

You know what's nice?  A person (the young girl) who was there just for the money and, yet, by her distance of the worries of running this facility, does some pretty unorthodox things with some of the elderly residents she gets close to.  She sees not just the old people they have become but glimpses of who they were when they were young.

It's the holidays and all the nice people have left to spend Christmas with loved ones except these 4 very mean, very demanding, residents.  She's left alone to care for them and they run her ragged.  When she's fed up ... her intolerance changes everything and everyone.

It's really a sweet story, again, beautifully shot.  Beautiful scenery of changing seasons.

It will make you happy.

I expected something like the best exotic marigold hotel, but it was much better than I expected. There were the outsized personalities, an idyllic setting, a young love story, but none of it went exactly as expected, and there were no tidy endings. When the characters did unburden themselves, it was believable, even if it was somewhat predictable. I recommend both movies if you like this sort of thing, but How About You is superior in almost every way.

This film is not perfect, and some parts of the story seem abnormally abrupt. The persistent use of marijuana as a problem solving device was a minor annoyance to me. Nevertheless, one has to make compromises when viewing movies today, because there is so much dreadful muck in them. I could overlook the minor faults here, and enjoy the production.

The actors and actresses put on a professional and polished production. The movie is easy to look at, as well as to listen.

3765903,5,B001QLKI18,"This movie snuck up and surprised me with its wisdom and lessons on life and transformation.  You always hear how older people carry much wisdom for the young to learn from.  Well in this movie that theory is a bit flipped and its the younger person reminding the older of how to continue living a joyful life, even if getting old, as they say, is a pain in the rear end.

There's a part in this movie that I connected with so much, even though I haven't reached that big five-o year yet.  Possible Spoiler Alert:

Its where a terminally ill senior is sitting and reflecting on life with the young aide she's recently befriended. The scene itself is almost dreamlike as the two are sitting in the winter foilage next to a stream with snowflakes falling.

The senior says, ""You see things properly just as you're about to leave. And its as if you're seeing them for the first time. Everything seems to shine.""

Now maybe it was the medicinal marijuana the young lady had given the senior to puff on that gave her this profound vision on life, but I'd like to think it was the result of being closer to her maker that inspired feelings of connectivity to everything in the world.  Either way, its a moment that echoed through the rest of the movie for me.  Many, like myself, who've survived a debilatating illness, remember similar feelings like this senior woman had at that moment.  Life seems to sparkle at you from all corners of the universe during or after a near-death experience.  And if we recognize that sparkle we can't help but return a sparkling smile at life, just as this senior did.

The handful of elderly residents all have wonderfully quirky personalities - odd, but realistic. Combined with some unique camera angles (the back of a car, listening to a discussing by looking through a door window), it has visual appeal as well. The whole thing feels very organic and genuine.

3765907,4,B001QLKI18,"Anthony Byrne's How About You (2007), adapted from Maeve Binchy's short story, ""The Hard Core"", differs markedly from the original story. Published in Binchy's Christmas story collection, This Year it Will Be Different (1996), the original story has Ellie as a well- intentioned if not slatternly care-giver whom the residents enjoy. Unlike in the film, Kate and Ellie are not sisters in the short story but employer and employee, with Ellie left to manage Woodlands after Kate is called away to care for her ailing mother across the country, in Darwin, Australia. It is then that Ellie confronts the ""hard core"", four cantankerous residents, for their outrageous behavior and it is she who explains to them the real possibility that Woodlands may close as a result of their various abuses. As a result, the four come together and attempt to keep the home open.

Byrne's film, How About You, borrows its title from a well-known song from the musical, Babes on Broadway (1941). Anthony Byrne's holiday piece, now set in Ireland, takes a few liberties but they are not distracting. Similar to the short story, Ellie (Hayley Atwell) finds herself left to care for the remaining residents at Woodlands: Donald (Joss Ackland), Georgia (Vanessa Redgrave), Heather (Brenda Fricker) and her sister, Hazel (Imelda Staunton). What makes How About You delightful are the actors who play their roles well. Atwell's Ellie is charming and believable as a free-spirited, if not occasionally fiery young woman, who in one scene, offers a dying resident a particular ""cure"" despite Kate's disapproval. Jean Pasley's screenplay allows us to see greater depth and character development. In one scene, Georgia sings ""How About You"" to a band of merry revelers at the local pub but when a haggard Ellie comes to take her home, it is their conversation on the way back that shows us how complicated people can be. The writing does not condescend to its characters and Byrne retains Binchy's message that people, regardless of their age, deserve to be challenged, if not confronted, in order to find a balance against an insistent selfishness. But they also find redemption in small acts of kindness and forgiveness despite having been cruel and vindictive. The film's ending is not particularly sentimental and maybe even abrupt. Nevertheless, this remains a memorable Christmas film, if only to watch Ackland, Redgrave, and Staunton, all playing their roles with a fair bit of panache.

The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.",1273363200,,2515,5.131707317073171
3765908,2,B001QLKI18,"The only good thing I can say about this film is the cast.  Everyone in the film are wonderful character actors - the problem is the script is just awful.  The two sisters clearly LOATHE each other and I could not figure out why the younger sister didn't quit working at the senior home and move out, since her cranky older sister (Orla Brady) is always complaining about everything she does.  The sisters have nothing in common and the Orla Brady character is quite frankly a bitch-on-wheels.  I really like Orla Brady and have seen her in other films and she is a very fine actress.  BBC America series ""Mistresses"" gave her a good role and that TV show will give you a wonderful chance to see what a great actress she is.

If Vanessa Redgrave, Joss Ackland, Imelda Staunton, Orla Brady and Brenda Fricker cannot save a film - then it is hopeless.  I watched it on cable so at least I didn't waste money buying the DVD or a movie ticket.

The plot is very hoke-y and cliche-o-rama.  All the residents of the private senior citizen home are rude, crazy, cranky and mean.  But of course, there is the sweet, dear little ole widow who bonds with the nice younger sister and the two of them team up together and the bitchy older sister resents it since she alleges the time the two friends spend together takes her sister away from the work at the senior home.  I mean what is there really to do except cook meals and laundry?  There are only four residents and the two sisters - so how much ""work"" is there to do?

The basic premise of the film has plot holes galore.  Why does Ellie, the nice, sweet sister STAY THERE?  Her sister is a slave master and a bore.  The movie drags on and there isn't much action or story to give this film substance.

  I give it a C minus.  It isn't horrible - just boring and slowly paced.",1269820800,4,1821,4.315634218289086

All the traditional ingredients are here for just that film, but this movie does something different- it lets old people be old people.  The ""edgy young person"" doesn't get them to embrace life by reminding them what it is to be young, she does it by pointing out to them that they are awful human beings and to recognize the humanity in each other,and in her.

This is a gem of a movie and its only real weakness is that the end comes up on you a bit suddenly.  Solid acting, inspiring, and with a good moral- fine for families as it only has a bit of rough language and most of that not of a variety that would bother American ears.",1258156800,49,814,4.165605095541402
