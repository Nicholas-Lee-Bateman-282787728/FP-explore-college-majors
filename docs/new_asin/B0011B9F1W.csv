8241242,5,B0011B9F1W,"On occasion I am asked to meet with Vets dealing with Post Traumatic Stress issues. I have also been asked to meet with Vets simply trying to put it back together. In many cases they find that no one understands what they went through, especially wives and family members ... and they are right. Only another warrior can understand a warrior, and only Jesus Christ can bring true peace to a man's heart.

That is what ""A Quiet Hope"" is all about.

Although the five men presented in this movie are Viet Nam Vets (and now are Calvary Chapel Pastors), this film speaks to all Vets including Desert Storm and Afghanistan. I strongly recommend that all Pastors and Christian counselors have 1 or 2 of these on hand to give to a struggling Vet who might pass through their door.",1383436800,,773,4.514285714285714
