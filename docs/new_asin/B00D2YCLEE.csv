8588816,3,B00D2YCLEE,Great moves. Love the included resistance band. Only problem I have is that she moves too quickly from one thing to the next. I barely have time to understand and follow the cues much less get anything from the move before she is on to the next. I would also love it if there were modifications provided.,1494892800,,304,4.350877192982456
8588817,5,B00D2YCLEE,more advanced pilates but love Mari and Pilates,1487462400,2,47,5.0
8588818,5,B00D2YCLEE,"I enjoy Winsor Pilates, I use these workouts on days when I just want a quiet, peaceful workout. Mari is encouraging  and challenging with a very
pleasant demeanor.",1483747200,2,164,4.857142857142857
8588819,4,B00D2YCLEE,"It's all moving a bit fast to me, but other than that it's harder than what I thought it would be. Great for losing weight!",1442016000,3,123,3.96
8588820,4,B00D2YCLEE,"The pink band is difficult to use. It takes several rounds of practice to learn how to keep it from bunching up or snapping off your feet. And because it will move suddenly and snap against you it can be uncomfortable. BUT! The routines on this DVD offer great new moves to try, especially for the experienced Winsor Pilates user. I have used Winsor Pilates for over 12 years and I found many of the moves here challenging and new. I especially like the Flow, Restore and Stretch options. The Energize routine is a doozy.

If you don't already have the Winsor Pilates with Accerlator workout get that first, it's the best there is. If you're looking to expand your existing Winsor library then this is a good addition.",1440201600,4,718,4.565891472868217
8588821,3,B00D2YCLEE,I ordered this edition because I wanted to use the stretch band to assist with stretches.  I found these workouts to be for advanced  Pilates practioners.  I would not recommend it for beginners or for anyone with any health issues.,1435968000,4,232,4.75
8588822,4,B00D2YCLEE,Mari Windsor is always good.,1426032000,,28,4.8
