8343456,4,B001UE7BXY,"HORROR GRINDSHOW DOUBLE FEATURE
A Ron Ford & Mac Cobb flick.
With Jackson Bostwick & Wes Deitrick

This a  obvious labor of love and something for all-genre video geeks to eat up !
Okay, Lets get the mean comments out of the way...These 2 films are totally different by accident or on purpose, First one (Twist Of A Vampire) comes off as nostalgic and something from a kindler-gentler era, Second( The Road) is gritty-vicious and takes no prisoners.
Do these films jell together , NO, But they are entertaining and at a theatre  one would warn parents that violence goes from pg13 to R, Almost building to climax of gore.
( Ed.note- Hey in ""Grindhouse"",Death Proof and Planet Terror didn't jive either, Hmm.)
  ""Twist"" has some tributes to Darren McGavin, A death scene from Dark Shadows and a nice surprise ending.
  ""Road"" has very scary moments and some awesome effects with headless, dismembering and ooze.
  Stars: Jackson Bostwick ( Tv's Captain Marvel & TRON),Ron Ford ( TIKI) and Wes Deitrick( Home Of The Brave) are used well and enjoyed the witty scripts.
To add to The `Grind House' genre, There are trailers for Crawling Brain/Paint Drying: The Movie/Hollywood Mortuary and Ho Ho Homicidal.
  Extras include: Trailer and interviews, Hey how can you interview Mac Cobb( Nasty S. O.B.) and not Jackson Bostwick ?",1236211200,,1322,4.883408071748879
