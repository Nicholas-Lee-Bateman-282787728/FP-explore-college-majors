8570392,5,B00BLF9FXG,worth every bit and then some more. I wish they would release some more of the old black America movies.,1421539200,,104,4.25
8570393,5,B00BLF9FXG,Great triple feature. I loved it.,1410048000,,33,4.666666666666667
8570394,5,B00BLF9FXG,Three great drive-in/Grindhouse classics.  The Mighty Peking Man is a joy to watch.,1404000000,,83,5.384615384615385
8570395,5,B00BLF9FXG,"Only in the early to mid-Seventies could you find a line-up like this at the local passion pit.  THE MIGHTY PEKING MAN isn't quite up there with the best of the Godzilla franchise (some might even say it's not up there with the worst of the Godzilla franchise), but was one of several films to cash in on all the publicity around Dino De Laurentiis 1976 remake of KING KONG.  DETROIT 9000 was part of the ""Blaxploitation"" era, and holds up as a pretty good action-thriller with some nice plot twists.  SWITCHBLADE SISTERS (also shown as THE JEZEBELS and THE PLAYGIRL GANG) is an over-the-top but entertaining tale about an all female street gang who have little sentiment and no sympathy for anyone who's an outsider.  It's not WEST SIDE STORY, but it's a lot of fun.  You can't go wrong with this package of retro-exploitation from the days of REAL grindhouses.",1398038400,,862,4.644736842105263
8570396,1,B00BLF9FXG,"I have reviewed these movies before.  I don't imagine they have improved much.  I think that maybe the idea is that if a movie is bad enough, then it will be amusing to poke fun at it in a group showing.  Well, I wasn't amused.  drek is drek.",1376524800,,242,3.9791666666666665
8570397,4,B00BLF9FXG,"I love that cheesiness and schlock seems to be making a come back and one of the people most responsible for that is Mr. Quentin Tarantino, he definitely has good taste as far as cheesy good/bad low budget movies go and this set is no exception, my favorite of the 3 is Switchblade Sisters and I've never seen it in near this quality, I think it alone is worth the price of the set, the producers really took their time and cleaned up these movies beautifully, all 3 movies look amazing, great set if your into non mainstream low budget flicks done well.",1371513600,6,554,4.388349514563107
8570398,4,B00BLF9FXG,"Expliotation at its best. Tarantino's Rolling Thunder three set collection is a must for fans of the genre! Thanks to Tarantino, now we can discover all the funny and action packed films like these. Good to bring back this collection back on DVD. Enjoy!",1370476800,3,253,4.7727272727272725
8570399,4,B00BLF9FXG,"If you love grindhouse or drive-in action films, this is a nice set to have.  It features the MIGHTY PEKING MAN, a King-Kong ripoff that is so bad it's kinda fun--especially with the good-looking and hardly-ever-clad Evelyn Craft around.
None of these films has the slightest bit of class--and that's why they're fun.  Just go with it--and enjoy yourself.",1369267200,3,355,5.0
8570400,4,B00BLF9FXG,"With Miramax licensing their catalogue to both Lionsgate and Echo Bridge Entertainment we have been seeing loads of bargain sets of their films pop up. Distraught on how Echo Bridge was handling many of the titles I waited until I read some reviews to see if buying this Lionsgate triple feature was worth it. Now I can confirm that it is!

The set is made of up three Exploitation films from the 70s that helped inspire director Quentin Tarantino, whose Rolling Thunder pictures re-released the films in the 90s. All three films were previously released on DVD in single editions and this new triple feature set has all three films on a single sided, duel layered disc. I was disappointed at first as I was hoping it would be a double disc set along the lines of Shout! Factory's Roger Corman sets but alas the quality of the transfers doesn't suffer too much from being crammed onto one disc and the set is FAR better than the bargain Miramax sets Echo Bridge has been pumping out.

There are no special features and the entertaining commentary with director Jack Hill and Quentin Tarantino on the single DVD release of ""Switchblade Sisters"" is missing but a nicely priced bargain set like this one can't complain. The widescreen transfers are all anamorphic and the digital blocks common with cramming three films onto a single dvd is kept to an absolute minimum and didn't hinder my enjoyment of the films at all. Blu-Ray enthusiest will no doubt be disappointed but again this is a bargain set and the transfers are much better than expected for all films being on a single disc. If your a fan of 70s exploitation films then this set is a must own!",1366502400,13,1653,4.638225255972697
