SURVIVOR SERIES 2013

I have always been a huge fan of this event but as the years have gone on the matches have changed. I loved when the event was all elimination matches, and didn't mind when they would have all team matches and then a title match. Eventually it was eked down to what it is now, a few team elimination matches and  the rest of the card looking like a normal PPV card. Although I loved the one night tournament in 98 like they did with Wrestlemania 4.

Spoilers

1.[ELIMINATION MATCH]REY MYSTERIO, GOLDUST & CODY RHODES, THE USOS VS THE SHIELD & THE REAL AMERICANS-easily the most fun match on the card and may be my favorite. First off I love the traditional tag matches and in fact wish the whole event would revert back to these matches. At one point this event may have been my favorite of the year [toss up between this and the Rumble]. Any way this was an excellent match with something funny beforehand. Both teams did excellent here although I was disappointed my boy Ambrose was eliminated earlier than I would have thought. We also get two big swings and Goldust continuing his great comeback as of late. Still the story here was Roman Reigns and his BIG comeback being the lone survivor and winner for his team.

2.[I-C TITLE]BIG E LANGSTON VS CURTIS AXEL-this was a better match than most give it credit for and was a rematch for Axel to try and get his title back. Both did well here but this was to put Big E over more. Good match over all.

3.[ELIMINATION MATCH]TOTAL DIVAS VS TRUE DIVAS-the final elimination match of the night and it is a quick one. The eliminations come fast here until it is down to the people you would expect to carry this thing. My girl Natalya gets the victory here taking out AJ in the end. This was entertaining which was a good thing. Still think there should have been more elimination matches.

4. RYBACK VS MARK HENRY-another match but this time it is from Wrestlemania as Ryback interrupted the legends up top. He came out and issued an open challenge which was answered by the main that beat him at Mania. This was a good match with both men showcasing their power. But it was Henry who looked better in his return here. He gets another win over Ryback.

5.[WORLD TITLE]JOHN CENA VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-this was a good match right here with Del Rio attacking that arm that Cena had injured. The momentum was back and forth in this match with them countering each other constantly at one point. Cena was able to keep the belt but this was a good match. Also the skit backstage after this was cool and it was great to see Johnny Ace I don't care what anyone says.

6. CM PUNK & DANIIEL BRYAN VS ERICK ROWAN & LUKE HARPER-I had a feeling going in this was going to be a good match and I was right. The Wyatt family took advantage of their size and used power moves to beat the smaller men down. This lead to Punk and Bryan using some double team moves and high risk maneuvers like Punk going to the outside from the. Despite the size advantage Punk and Bryan take the victory here after a GTS.

7.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS THE BIG SHOW-this was Shows chance at the title after being able to get reinstated into the WWE after being fired. This was good match between the two as Orton was trying to chop Show down and hit and run as other reviews have stated. But once Show got his hands on him he lit him up with chops and power moves. Eventually a distraction cost Show the match and his chance at the title. After the match a showdown was set up to hype another match in the future.

BONUS MATCH

1. KOFI KINGSTON VS THE MIZ-I don't care what anybody says I always enjoy when these two go at it. These two have a good chemistry and it showed here. This was a good back and forth affair full of action. Kofi came with his normal high flying offense while Miz tried to keep him grounded. In the end The Miz picks up the win after it looks like he is close to losing.

You also get Big Show and Ortons encounter from Smackdown and an interview with Orton after the event.",1396915200,,4033,4.318783068783069
5943913,3,B00EU8RCAO,"For While We've Seen Dusty Rhodes Two Kids. Cody Rhodes and Dustin Rhodes(AKA GOLD DUST) Have a Sibling Rivalry So 2013 It Was Interesting To See Them Not Only Get Along But At The Time of Survivor Series Become The Tag Team Champions. Cody Rhodes and Gold Dust Would Team With Rey Mysterio and The Usos , The Uso's If You Ask Me Were Overdue to be a Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination Match! Anyway They Take on The Shield and Real Americans. I Never Fully Understood The Shield  And Whether or Not Nick Fury Gave Permission for their being! Then You had a 7 on 7 Divas Match! Yeah It Wasn't perfect But No One Was Hit With an Ugly Stick! I Found It Interesting That The Funkadactyls and The Bella Twins were on the same team with Natalya, JoJo  and the Red Hot Red Headed Diva Eva Marie. Survival of the fit.",1395705600,,812,4.266233766233766
5943914,3,B00EU8RCAO,"It should be noted that Triple H & Stephanie McMahon made an announcement at the start of the show that there would be no physical interference in not just only the WWE Championship match but throughout the entire show as well as the Survivor Series panel throughout the night consisting of Mick Foley, Booker T, and Bret Hart.

Elimination Match: Rey Mysterio, Goldust, Cody Rhodes, The Usos vs. The Shield & Real Americans - A traditional elimination match here with four of the top established tag teams & the return of Rey Mysterio that had various highlights such as pre-match twerking (yes, you read that right), how one participant ""talked himself out of the match"", back to back giant swings, the teamwork between all the team members, and one of the most dominate single performances in Survivor Series history.  This was a fun opening match.

Intercontinental Champion Big E. Langston vs. Curtis Axel - A rematch from Langston's title victory on RAW earlier in the week with Langston easily shoving off Axel's offense while showcasing his own power & explosive offense featuring clotheslines & shoulderblocks while Axel himself attempted some big moves himself such as a powerful forearm & using the apron for his clothesline & spear along with taking a cheap shot of his own.  This was a solid encounter.

Elimination Match - Total Divas vs. True Divas: Natalya, Bella Twins, Funkadactyls, Eva Marie, JoJo vs. A.J. Lee, Tamina Snuka, Kaitlyn, Alicia Fox, Rosa Mendes, Aksana, Summer Rae - I think this was the first Survivor Series match to have this many participants since the 20 man tag team elimination match dating back to the late 1980's but that's the only relevance past that obsecure fact as this match wasn't much with many of the eliminations happening so quick with some occurring after just one offensive move but did have some minor highlights such as a dance off that had J.B.L. reference Scotty 2 Hotty of all people.

Ryback vs. Mark Henry - Ryback issued an open challenge which was answered by rapper Rick Ross...I mean Mark Henry with Henry showcasing his superior power causing Ryback to not only use his own strength but also attempt to take away the power of Henry by grounding him & working over the legs as well that made Mark Henry resort to offense that we never seen before that shocked everyone including the announce team.  This match did it's job in establishing Marh Henry on his return but their WrestleMania match was more competitive.

World Champion John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio - John Cena came into this match without his protective arm brace tor the first time since his injury which Del Rio targeted right away using whatever possible from the ringside environment to various wrestling moves like the armbar hammerlock while also being able to keep Cena from getting any string of momentum for a long period of time countering his offense resulting in Cena being able to only hit one big move at a time including one unique version of a neckbreaker before both men traded counters avoiding each other's signature moves.  They told the good story of Del Rio continuing to focus on Cena's arm & having more control than he previously had with Cena not having his arm protected but it's another case where I felt like their previous PPV was a better encounter.

C.M. Punk & Daniel Bryan vs. Luke Harper & Erick Rowan - Punk & Bryan made their intentions clear early on attempting to take away the size & power advantage showcased when they were a victim of a double suplex by working over the legs to ground him & double teaming with such moves like the old Hart Foundation Hart Attack while the Wyatt Family stuck to their game plan of a power attack with strikes & stomps while isolating a member of the other team but showed effects of the offense from Punk & Bryan as well.  This was a good tag team match.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Big Show - Orton attempted the strategy of ""hit & run"" using his speed advantage while Show was able to keep catching Orton with hard loud chops & various strikes including headbutts causing Orton to focus on another strategy of taking away his power advantage grounding Show before the action got taken to the outside where the ringside environment came into play on more than one occasion while both men were able to take back the advantage taking advantage of their surroundings & catching the other man off guard.  This match was definitely a few steps down from the series Orton had with Daniel Bryan as there were some clear botches throughout the match and continued the trend of finishes we've seen over the past few months where you were told one thing & got something completely different however I'll give it credit in that this was one of the best singles matches between these two but it was the aftermath that left the lasting impression.

This PPV continued the streak of shows for the past few months where you had a high amount of matches that either came off as fillers or rematches that wasn't as good of quality as the previous encounters so I recommend this for a rental or stream at first then make your decision to keep this.",1385769600,,5138,4.700778642936596
5943915,3,B00EU8RCAO,"The 10 men tag team elimination match between the team of Deam Ambrose,Seth Rollins,Roman Reigns,Antonio Cesaro & Jack Swagger against the team of Cody Rhodes,Goldust,Rey Myterio and The Uso Brothers(Jimmy & Jey) was a hard-fought,fun,entertaining bout with good story telling from Reigns. The IC title match between Big E Langston & Curtis Axel while not bad,it was forgettable at best. The 14 women tag team elimination match between the team of AJ Lee,Tamina,Alicia Fox,Summer Rae,Aksana,Kaitlyn & Rosa Mendes against the team of Nikki Bella,Brie Bella,Cameron,Naomi,Natalya,Eve Marie & JoJo was very rushed but with that many wrestlers in a 3 hour time-frame,can you blame them? The Mark Henry-Ryback match was short yet back-and-forth. The Worlds title match between John Cena & Alberto Del Rio while good,it was missing something special. The tag team match between CM Punk & Daniel Bryan against The Wyatt Family's Luke Harper & Erick Rowan was a really fun and competitive bout. The WWE title match between The Big Show & Randy Orton was short and below average with a lame ending to boot. I give this PPV 5 out of 10.",1385337600,,1126,5.091891891891892

Good matches:
The opener and Cena vs. Del Rio (albeit, it took a while for both of them to get going).

Decent match:
Bryan and Punk vs. The Wyatt Family. The two real stars of the promotion are spinning their wheels while Big Show gets a baffling main event spot.

Bad matches:
Everything else. Especially the main event.",1419379200,,433,4.5256410256410255
