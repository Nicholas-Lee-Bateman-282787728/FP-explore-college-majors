4331027,5,B004CZZZUY,"711 Ocean Drive, 1950 film

This is a very good drama that uses a fictionalized version of a true crime. Some scenes show Boulder Dam in Nevada, close to Las Vegas. Is this story a warning for those who get too ambitious? The story starts in the Police Gangster Squad where a new man is put in charge. Then we see a telephone repairman talking about his life. They talk about the cost of living (caused by rising prices and a devalued currency). A bookmaker waits in the washroom for business. He asks Mel Granger to join him for coffee, then offers him a job as an electronics expert for a news publisher of a wire service. A wire service is a legitimate business that sells information. Expanding this business can lead to greater profits (if the customers are buying). Vince Walters also runs a check cashing business too. The police are investigating ""Liberty Finance"" as a front for bookmaking.

The scene shifts to a race track, we see how signals are passed to an accomplice. An old man with a hearing aid asks about the odds on the races. Trudi is caught passing signals. The old man is caught with an unlicenced transmitter. This problem can be solved, but Mel wants a bigger cut. Small bookmakers are arrested but the wire service remains in operation. One bookmaker is deep in debt, so he cancels the lender. The police question Mel, one warns him to get out of this business. Mel takes over Walters' operation, and raises prices (no competition). The National Syndicate in Cleveland is looking at Mel's operation. Can they take it over? One employee in Miami cheated, they will take care of him. Can they expand in Los Angeles"" Larry Mason meets Mel, who knows who he is and why he is there. At a meeting in Palm Springs they offer Mel protection and a share of the national business.

If they can't cut into Mel's business can they call the Gangster Squad and tell about Mel? Another man is bumped off, the police investigate. Was this killer put on the spot to silence him? The police talk to Mel about a streetcar horn. Mel goes to Las Vegas to make a big score before he leaves the country. He will tap the gamblers' telephone lines, tape the results, then add a delay so they can place a sure bet on the winner! They remove the evidence of the telephone lines. But the gamblers look into their losses and learn Mel, the electronics ace, is in town.

Mel's buddy Chippie Evans is abducted for questioning and judgement. The hotel key tells where he stayed. The LA police arrive in town to arrest Mel, they learned of the flaw in his alibi. Mel and his girl go to look for Chippie, who never returned. But Mel sees the LA detective and decides to flee to Arizona. Can he evade the road block? Mel joins the tour of Boulder Dam. He sees the LA detective watching him! Can they escape on the path across the dam to Arizona? Mel leaves his girl to climb a narrow stairway. There is gunfire when Mel goes out into the road. Is this the end of Mel?

The ending warns against illegal gambling, the $2 bet that fosters crime and corruption. The attraction of a job as a bookmaker is being in business for yourself. There is a low barrier in not needing a large amount of capital or an expensive shop or office. They operate out of their hat, as the old saying goes.

(O'Brien's technical knowledge of the telephone system is on full display in both ""White Heat"" and in ""711 Ocean Drive."")

Crowther for the Times panned the picture: ""Despite some considerable advertising of 711 Ocean Drive as a daring and courageous revelation of the big bookmaking and gambling syndicates, this modest Columbia melodrama, which came to the Paramount yesterday, is no more than an average crime picture with some colorful but vague details thrown in. Certainly no one who reads the papers with a fairly retentive eye can have any less comprehension of the gambling racket than is illustrated here...In short, this little picture, conventionally written but well photographed, does no more than any gangster picture in reminding us that gangsters are crooks.""

Very little else can be found through Google. Watch it yourself; if you like crime noir, I would be very surprised if you didn't find it very rewarding.

4331045,5,B004CZZZUY,"I always preferred Edmond OBrien as the good guy(White Heat,The Killers,DOA,The Web,etc)but this is a great film noir crime classic..
Edmond is a worker for the phone company whos fed up with his small salary when hes told by a bookie hes got a million dollar know how and would be a great help to illegal gambling. Edmond joins a local bookie organization run by Barry Keely. Soon,Barry is killed by a member of the gang whos in to the mobster for a lot of money.
Needless to say,MR OBrien takes over and soon hits the top.
The local crime syndicate run by Otto Kruger(Murder,My Sweet,Cover Girl,)finds out about Edmonds great work and makes him a partner.
Edmond becomes an unfeeling hoodlum who will kill anybody who stands in his way. His only love is pretty Joanne Dru(Red River,Hell On Frisco Bay)
We are warned at the end of the film what happens when we make a(GASP)two dollar bet and the fate of bad boys like Edmond.
Great chase scene at the end of the film.
This film might be dated,but its still good..Dont Miss.",1324425600,10,1024,4.54054054054054
8424240,2,B004CZZZUY,"Big disappointment. I had just watched DOA with O'Brien and was in the mood to see more of him. I had seen this once before (no problem, I love to repeat) but it was confused in my memory with another movie which I had enjoyed much more. Lots of familiar faces and good noir types in the cast and Planer comes from German Expessionism but didn't manifest much in this movie. There must be a couple of hundred more interesting noir than this one. Also, too much time spent on hard-to-understand and not intrinsically-interesting details of how the bookie racket works.",1527638400,,567,4.623762376237623
