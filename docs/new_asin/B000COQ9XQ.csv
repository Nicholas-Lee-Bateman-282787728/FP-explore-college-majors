I tried study groups, reading  different books...but this video is what really saved my bacon!  Now I'm actually teaching other students how to do this stuff.",1137542400,12,261,4.886363636363637
2467620,5,B000COQ9XQ,I didn't expect too much when I ordered the DVD but I was blown away!  It really exceeded my expectations in all areas and helped me pull up grades.  I've been telling everyone in class how great this DVD is and most of them are going to buy it too.  I've gone from being at the back end of the curve to being a 'curve buster'!  Who would have thought!!,1135814400,7,353,4.0
2467621,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Sometimes I get lost in my Calculus book....and when I do I pop this DVD and everything becomes clear.  My grades have improved almost over night.  Everything in the course is excellent but the parts that really helped me the most were all of the integration techniques...almost all of them are covered.  Integration by parts, trig substitution...its all here.  All you need to do is watch!",1135468800,10,390,4.863636363636363
2467622,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Haven't viewed the integral stuff yet but I have looked at the material on derivatives and it is fantastic!  This guy really knows what he is talking about and some things that I never understood in class just seem so easy now.  Examples involving position, acceleration, velocity and the like are used to introduce the concept of a derivative and there are no boring derivations.  Everything is relevant to actually doing the problems, which has helped me greatly.",1135296000,6,465,4.935897435897436
2467623,5,B000COQ9XQ,I have a few DVDs on Calculus but this one is the best.  For the price you get a lot of content and the author doesn't just work the easy problems.  I find that when I do my homework I come back to this DVD to give me a little help.,1134864000,5,232,3.5294117647058822

2467625,5,B000COQ9XQ,"THIS is the very BEST tutorial on Calculus I have ever taken. The instructor, Jason Gibson, is absolutely gifted explaining a complex subject...This instructor, I very much applaud and thank..he's good!! I am not a mathematician and have a BA Criminal Justice and working on an MA history...I can work the problems of Derivatives and Integrals..Thank you, Jason...George K.",1411430400,,373,5.338983050847458
2467626,4,B000COQ9XQ,"This DVD has great coverage on derivative, which is essential for calculus I. The rest of calculus I is actually covered on the Calculus II advanced dvds, which I purchased in addition to this dvd set.

The second disc begins on Integral to prepare for calculus II. It covers everything in the integral chapter.

I advise to watch these videos then try many additional problems to reinforce comprehension. The video themselves are great for understanding, but achieving an A in math will require A LOT more practice.

Pre-Requisite:
I am realizing that Jason provides great teaching for how to do calculus, but he won't cover theoretical things behind integrals. This is fine I suppose because this is what a textbook is used for. He's just here to show you how to do these problems. BUT a theoretical understanding behind the math, I believe, is essential for long-term math success.

He does not review things that you should have learned in trig or algebra, so you need to have a good grasp on these topics before touching the materials covered here.",1401667200,2,1053,4.833333333333333
2467627,3,B000COQ9XQ,"Same as the other tape I purchased, the videos are very specific about each topic but the instructor is a bit hard to follow because sometimes speaks too fast. This is a good video for people using it as a refresher, but not for a classroom to support a lesson. I would recommend it to supplement online Calculus classes at college, but not to supplement basic calculus lessons in high school.",1395705600,,393,4.549295774647887
2467628,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Well planned and concise calculus review; I highly recommend it as a refresher course.  However, I could not find any computer player or file extension that is compatible with this media. Standalone DVD players work fine.",1395619200,,221,5.138888888888889
2467629,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Last fall my son enrolled in Calculus 1 as a college freshman. I thought that, having taken calculus 40 years ago, it might be an interesting time for me to try a refresher -- so we agreed to put our heads together now and then. Since the textbook (Stewart) was none too friendly, we soon started assembling background materials to help us along. We bought several books, including ""The Calculus Lifesaver"" by Adrian Banner; ""How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide"" by Adams, Thompson and Hass; and ""The Humongous Book of Calculus Problems"" by Kelley. In addition to this ""Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor"" DVD, we checked out two of the calculus video series put out by The Great Courses, and checked out several of the many tutorials on YouTube.

Now that the semester is over, I can say that this DVD by Jason Gibson is the first resource that we turned to (and got the most out of) in getting through the basic ideas of derivatives and integrals in Calculus 1.  As other reviews here note, Gibson is a fine teacher, and he does a good job in making the topics clear.  By comparison, we found the ""Great Courses"" series that we sampled to be very fusty -- more geared to an audience quite a bit older.  We soon found, however, that a number of topics in my son's first-semester calculus class were not covered in this DVD, so we ended up buying Gibson's other calculus DVDs.  Even then, however, some topics just aren't covered, so we also turned frequently to various YouTube tutorials.  We also got a lot of help from the books ""How to Ace Calculus"" and ""The Calculus Lifesaver.""  (In fact, if you are a serious student and are motivated to really master calculus as completely as possible, I would recommend the ""Lifesaver"" book as the most comprehensive, but still reasonably friendly, treatment of Calculus 1 and 2.)

In sum, this DVD helped us quite a bit -- especially at first when we were first getting a handle on the basic material.  I wish I had resources like it the first time I studied calculus back in the dark ages.",1393632000,4,2026,4.543956043956044
2467630,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Jason is a great teacher who gives very straightforward lessons.  There are plenty of examples and the content is not too slow or fast.

That being said, it should be noted that if you're going to take Calc II you pretty much need to buy the ""Advanced Calc II"" course.  It shouldn't be titled ""Advanced Calc II"" so much as it should be titled ""The rest of Calc II we completely neglected in the last DVD.""  There are also a couple Calc I topics in the Advanced Calc II course as well, but if you get both they cover pretty much everything you will cover.  These aren't the cheapest DVDs but I consider it worth the money.",1392249600,,621,4.273504273504273
2467631,4,B000COQ9XQ,"This dvd is incredibly detailed.  As long as you can do basic algebra and are willing to learn, this dvd will help you.  However, if you are good at calculus and want a more challenging dvd, this is not for you.",1388966400,,211,4.121951219512195
2467632,4,B000COQ9XQ,I bought this for my daughter who started her freshman year in college in Calc 2 and was very stressed because she skipped Calc 1. I was pleased when she said the tutor was good and it was a help.,1378857600,,196,3.925
2467633,3,B000COQ9XQ,Okay product but I feel like you have to have time and patience in order to really get to the problem and understand it. Best used during a summer break before the class not during the semester while taking this class.,1377907200,,218,4.341463414634147
2467634,5,B000COQ9XQ,"These DVD's are definitely geared for the student who is a little bit nervous about math! The emphasis is on working problems, the nuts and bolts of how it all fits together. Great explanations, easy to understand format, terrific review (if you've already had Calculus), step by step instructions. If you're looking for theory, you will have to get that elsewhere.",1376092800,,365,5.0
2467635,5,B000COQ9XQ,This is very concise intro to Calculus and really prepares the student for the concepts of calc. The most important section for me was Related Rates: I watched this multiple times and it helped me understand this very difficult topic!!!,1375660800,,236,4.925

2467640,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I loved this tutorial.  My calculus professor makes everything seem insanely hard and I had resigned myself to dropping the class. But thanks to some encouragement from my spouse I decided to get some help and stick w/ it.  It has been a few years since I took algebra and trig, so I wanted something that wouldn't use a ton of trig w/out explaining it.  I ended up buying these DVDs, as well as study aid full of calculus problems (""The Humongous Book of Calculus Problems"" by W. Michael Kelley). This dvd substituted for my professor, and the study aid helped me practice. By the time I had to work on class problems I felt prepared, although I still needed a bit of help on the hard problems. I don't know if this is unique to my class, but both dvds only covered Calc I. Maybe this would cover high school calc I & II.  Love these DVDs, highly recommend to anyone else who struggles.  He really simplifies the topic for those of us who aren't mathematicians.",1350604800,2,962,4.4124293785310735
2467641,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I had to take an online Calculus class as a pre-requisite for an MBA program. Let's just say the ""class"" was severely lacking.
These DVDs filled the monumental gaps left by the online course's instruction.  It's mean to supplement textbooks, but to be honest, I learned more from these DVDs than my book.",1346112000,2,304,4.735849056603773
2467642,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Math, perhaps more than any other subject, depends on having a teacher who knows how to explain the subject.  If Jason Gibson could be cloned and put in front of Calculus classes around the country there would be a lot less frustration on the part of students.  The course is taught in a straight forward fashion, no theory, no long and mind numbing proofs, just the steps to take to solve problems.",1337040000,2,399,4.527777777777778
2467643,5,B000COQ9XQ,Mr. Gibson does an excellent job explaining calculus in an understandable way with lots of useful problem examples.  Very good teacher who manages to keep it pretty light and interesting while covering some pretty tough material.,1311897600,,229,5.361111111111111
2467644,5,B000COQ9XQ,"This is my 2nd purchase in this Calculus Tutor series.  I bought this for my Son who is a Junior in high school.  He took Calculus A/B in the 1st half of the year and signed up for B/C the 2nd half.  Unfortunately, he found calculus B/C much more challenging so he decided to drop it and retake next year for college prep.  Bottom line...my son says these are excellent.  They show step by step for each problem & solution and they can be replayed time and time again.  My 16 year old son highly recommends this product for anyone looking to get a better understanding of calculus A/B or B/C.  Needless to say Dad is happy as well.",1301356800,2,631,4.2521008403361344
2467645,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I'm an MD I don't really need everyday calculus application but I found that such stuff is a great get away for my poor medicine exhausted brain. So I took to watching math DVDs in the evening hours just for relaxation. I first got my hands on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Standard-Deviants-Calculus-1-2/dp/B0002TSZQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Standard Deviants : Calculus 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;and it was very entertaining although to really grasp the point I needed like 4-5 times of watching them and still things like Chain Rule are too complicated in the Standard Deviants presentation. Still I liked Calculus & didn't want to give up. So I got Jason's DVD having already a very satisfying experience with his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Probability-and-Statistics-Tutor-10-Hour-Course-3-DVD-Set-Learn-By-Examples/dp/B0016G8HX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Probability and Statistics Tutor - 10 Hour Course - 3 DVD Set - Learn By Examples!</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trigonometry-and-Pre-Calculus-Tutor-2-DVD-Set-5-Hour-Course/dp/B000B51SRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus Tutor - 2 DVD Set! - 5 Hour Course!</a>.
And I wasn't disappointed. I am only watching this DVD for a first time now, so I can't say yet for what's in the end but I really enjoyed the Chain Rule presentation. Made me kinda want to go apply it somewhere! What I especially appreciate about Jason's presentation of the material is that I don't need to check anything up additionally, or get busy with notes or calculations. Every tiny step in the reasoning is thoroughly explained so that even such a barbarian as I am (being myself educated in Siberia and never even heard about the existence of Calculus before a year or so ago) can follow the flow of the tutorial and feel respected and cared for by the teacher. And that, my friends, is one great feeling!
One more notion. I enjoy watching Jason's videos with a music soundtrack on my computer. I mean I just turn on my favorite music like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Those-Once-Loyal/dp/B000BNTML4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Those Once Loyal</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smear-Campaign/dp/B000H0MMH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smear Campaign</a>&nbsp;;) in the background so that it doesn't impede tutorial appreciation and that's one great fun of a free time. I noticed that listening to tutor's voice alone in my earphones without a constant sonic background makes my ears feel uncomfortable. Kinda like watching movies on a computer screen in a dark room is bad for the eyes, isn't it?
Might sound strange, but ""Enjoy!"" is how I'm gonna end this review ;)
Enjoy!",1295308800,4,2888,6.5234375
2467646,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Excellent math dvd that all in Calc I could learn from. He explains each concept in a easy to understand format, and you can pause or work the questions then he explains them. Great value for the money. All who would like to do very well in the class should purchase this dvd, because the practice will allow you to work the questions quickly.",1293062400,,343,4.375
2467647,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I bought this DVD set because I wanted a calculus refresher after many years away from it.  The presenter, Jason Gibson , has the best teaching style I have ever seen.  He presents the material on a marker board and works many problems to demonstrate various techniques.  I just wish his courses would have been around when I was in school.  I highly recommend this DVD set.",1287619200,,374,4.537313432835821
2467648,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Jason's DVDs are some of the few things I have taken time to review on Amazon because I find them extremely helpful.  As I have said in my reviews of his other DVDs I am returning to school to work on a physics degree which has required me to start at intermediate algebra and work my way up.  I am currently in Calculus I and used this DVD during the summer to get ready for class.  I want to start out with a caveat here.  If you are going to be taking Calc 1 and 2 at the college level, you would be best served to get both this DVD and the Advanced Calculus 2 DVD because, depending on your school, what is covered may not be in the same order as what Jason has laid out.

This DVD basically covers derivatives and integrals.  It goes very in depth into both those topics (regardless of the claims of the lower rated reviews)and covers all the main differentiation and integration rules you need to know.  It does not just cover the chain rule as the reviewer who gave the set one star claims.  That person either did not watch the every section or did not understand what was being presented.

Again you need to keep in mind that this is a supplement and does not cover everything you will see in class.  I can only use my class as a reference, but we started with a review of functions, then went into limits, then derivatives, and will finish with an introduction to integration.  There are also a couple of the topics covered on the Advanced Calc DVD set that will be covered in my Calc I class, which is why I am using that DVD set along with this one.  Plus I plan on continuing on to Calc II, so I will eventually end up using both.

The one big topic from first semester calculus that Jason does not go into much is limits.  He explicitly says at the beginning of the video that is he not covering everything, and explains why he excludes most of the limit material.  If you try to study just from this, skip class, and do not do the problems in the book, the first test or two will be a disaster.  So don't fall into that trap.  And while Jason does not cover most of the limit concepts that you will have to go through in class, I found knowing the material on the DVD ahead of time helpful to understand the ""big picture"" limit concepts even though I did not know the mechanical process for taking limits ahead of time.  He also does not cover all the types of applied problems (word problems)that you will see in class.

Ultimately whether you find this DVD useful will depend in large part how you learn.  This is basically like watching a lecture on TV.  Obviously you cannot interact as you can with a tutor, and you are limited to the problems that he works out.  Some of his problems will match what you get in class, other may not.  I look at these DVDs as showing the basics and presume I will encounter more complicated problems in the book and on the exams.  I use them before class to get an idea of what is going on, then from time to time during the semester if there is a concept I did not get completely in class from my teacher, or if I need to brush up on something.  If used in that way, and if your learning style is conducive to that kind of presentation, this will be a great investment.

****Update****
I am updating this review now that I am finished with my class.  As I said above I strongly recommend that you get this and the advanced calculus tutor dvd if you are taking classes at the college level.  There are things in that DVD set like the L'Hospital's rule and inverse trig functions that you will likely go over in first semester calculus that you will not get on this DVD.  The section on L'Hospital's rule will also give some insight into limits, which Jason pretty much omits on this DVD.  In class limits will be covered extensively before you get to derivatives, so that will help.  The other concept that Jason does not go into much at all on this DVD is the ""technical"" process for taking integrals.  He does explain it very briefly, but he does not go into detail about how to use the sum of areas of approximating rectangles to calculate the integral.  In my class we only got through the first chapter on integration, the first three sections of which deals with that concept.  Then we got to the fundamental theorem of calculus, the second part of which is what Jason does many examples of, and integration by substitution which is also covered in depth here.  Many of the sections on integration that are on this DVD will be covered in second semester calculus (calculus II) at the college level.

In all, this DVD covers about 80% of what you can expect to see on the final for the first semester of college level calculus.  There are definitely things not presented on the DVD that will be covered in class, so again use this as a supplement, not a replacement for going to class and doing homework problems. This is the material that if you can master it you will do well in the class.  Mastering this material will also help you understand the concepts that will be covered in class that are not presented here.",1287100800,9,5076,4.309799789251844

2467651,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I highly recommend any of his DVD's to anyone who has teachers who are really bad at explaining the fundamentals of the course.  The difficulty level of his examples are probably intermediate, but the way he conceptually teaches is fantastic.  I was out of school for 10 years and decided I wanted to go back and get a degree in mechanical engineering.  I was so lost until I found all of his DVD's.  I usually watch the explanations of the concepts the day before or the morning of that particular class.  When I get into class I understand what we're about to learn and can work problems right away.  the math tutor DVD website is also highly recommened.  There are alot of lesson plans on there that aren't on DVD like diferential equations and chemistry.

2467652,5,B000COQ9XQ,This dvd cuts out all the fluff and gets right to the meat of what you need to learn in your first semester of calculus. Definitely worth the price if you don't have the time to find a study group or go to a tutor. Highly Recommended.,1282780800,2,234,4.0
2467653,2,B000COQ9XQ,"I have compared this 8 hour video set, which cost $35 with other types of calculus videos that are easily available (many are free on Youtube). I would say, for the amount of time spent on this video, the author didn't cover enough or at least didn't give enough examples.  He took too much time repeating the same phrases during his lecturing (which wasn't necessary, since it's a video that people can rewind, when they miss something), so the time he ended up wasting could have been used for more examples.  I wouldn't recommend this video for calculus learners, because there are many free ones on youtube that are far better, and well explained for clear understanding. If the price for this video was $15, then I would say it's not bad.",1277510400,7,743,4.621212121212121
2467654,5,B000COQ9XQ,This is a good video especially if you have a teacher thats difficult to follow like I do.

2467655,1,B000COQ9XQ,"I bought this DVD for a business math MBA class I am in that heavily uses differential calculus. I learned nothing from this DVD and I'm not sure how anyone could. Ok, it defined a derivative. It mentioned the chain rule. But there are five other rules needed to calculate most derivatives (constant function, power function, sums and differences rule, product rule, quotient rule). This did not show me how to look at the problem and know how to solve it. Luckily we've moved on to statistics in the class, so there's still hope of me passing it, but the calculus part was a disaster.",1268179200,4,585,4.580952380952381
2467656,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Let me start out by saying that I am NOT a 'math person'. This fact was exacerbated by the fact that I attend a major research university, which employs many individuals with sub-par english skills as instructors in lower level math classes. WIthin two weeks of the start of the semester I was lost....until I found this DVD set. Jason does an outstanding job at laying out the fundamental rules of calculus, in a way everyone can understand. There are many examples with each new concept that is introduced, and they are all presented in a clear and concise format. Before long, I found that if I matched the DVD chapters with my syllabus, it wasn't necessary to attend class - and I received an A!

The material presented in this DVD covered a first semester university Calculus course perfectly - but this is not the DVD you want if you're taking a second semester course. Also, when a technical issue with the DVD arose, I emailed Jason and received a response within the hour. Not only is the teaching outstanding, but the customer service is as well. I cannot speak highly enough about this DVD - you will not regret the purchase!",1263513600,,1136,4.596059113300493
2467657,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I just finished the last part a few minutes ago. A week ago or so I started watching the DVD's after teaching myself about limits. Well, he jumped right into derivatives and I was okay with that. He was right where I needed to be taught and during his course he'll give you a lot of tidbits like, ""You won't really be using limits."" I thought that was pretty funny but relieved somewhat.

Everything he said made the topics easier to understand. I was able to follow through with what he did and he explained every step of the way so I never felt at any point lost or confused.

I'm trying to teach myself Calculus and his video lectures were a good starting point. I'd recommend him to anyone trying to do the same as long as you've got a good textbook and other valuable resources. I'm picking up things fairly quickly, so I'm hoping to get started on his videos on Advanced Calc II within the next few weeks.

He's not boring but he's not going to make you laugh either. The videos were purely meant for learning and demonstration of problem solving techniques. His job is to teach you how to work problems, not theory. I think he made that fairly clear.",1263340800,,1157,4.372093023255814
2467658,5,B000COQ9XQ,"This is a very good DVD that covers the basics of derivatives and integrals. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a refresher after some time away from calculus or to anyone who might need some extra help in the core calculus topics.

This DVD is basically Jason Gibson, the instructor, standing in front of a white board working calculus problems. There are no fancy menus, trailers, special features or Easter eggs! It's basically just a guy with colored markers and an eraser board. No bells and whistles.

It might sound a bit boring, but it really isn't. The instructor just cuts to the chase and makes it so easy to follow along. He primarily teaches by example, giving you the necessary skills to work problems. He does not go into too many proofs. For instance, on the topic covering the Chain Rule, he merely tells you how it works, but only briefly touches upon why it works. Yet, he provided about 5 very thorough examples, each one more complicated than the last. I will not fault him for his lack of proofs because this DVD is designed to be a companion to a calculus course rather than a complete calculus course. The Advanced Calc 2 DVD he put out is 14 hours long and goes into greater detail.

I had previously purchased Change and Motion Calculus Made Clear prior to this for double the price. It was much longer and I took very little away from it. I found that one hard to follow and almost unbearably boring to watch (even though that instructor used everything from graphs to toy cars to try and drive his point across). This DVD is much better. Give it a shot before before hiring a tutor! It could save you some money in the long run. I should point out that you need to be familiar with the basic trig identities as well as be comfortable with logs to get the most out of this DVD.

The only minor problem I could find is that he doesn't go into a lot of detail on limits and limit laws. But with that said, I will reiterate what I mentioned earlier. This is not a complete calculus course. Some universities split differentiation and integration into 2 separate semesters. So there is no way that an 8 hour DVD will cover all topics thoroughly. Gibson does do a good job at giving you a solid foundation on the core topics.  He helps make calculus more user friendly and less scary!

****update**** The advanced calculus 2 tutor dvd goes into detail with limits. The reason is that he covers it along with l'hospital's rule.",1261526400,,2456,4.470982142857143

I have a final in a week and was sick of teaching myself how to do things my teacher should have been explaining. This guy is a FANTASTIC teacher and breaks things down in a way that is clear and interesting. Will definitely be getting the next DVD for next semester.",1259625600,,396,4.293333333333333

2467661,3,B000COQ9XQ,"I think its a good video for gaining a better insight into problem solving (learning how to solve problems in a calculus way). Just like the saying ""practice makes perfect"". However,I just feel it lacks in giving you a good explanation of the theory behind the formulas. He does give a few visual examples of what a derivative and an integral mean graphically. Overall, I bought it because I recently had to take calculus 2 and had took calculus I three years ago and needed to review calculus I; and it served its purpose. I just wish someone would come out with a dvd set like this one that would better explain the concepts and the many different graphical ways of showing how calculus really works and can be used.",1251676800,,718,4.530769230769231
2467662,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I first stumbled onto Jason Gibson's DVD's when I was taking Trig a few years ago, and from there I've routinely ordered a corrosponding DVD set for any math class I was taking, or wanted to review.  So, having viewed several DVD lecture sets by Jason up to this point, I knew that the Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor would be just like the rest of them:  GREAT!
And, it was!
First things first:  NO one can be expected to cover ALL the topics you'll cover in your first calc class.  Next best thing?  Having someone cover those k-e-y topics that allow you to learn all the rest of them much more easily; and that's where Jason Gibson comes in.  He's VERY good using the DVD medium, showing you example after example of beginning, intermediate, and challenging problems.
These DVD's give a great over-view of the subjects learned in a university-level calculus class.  You watch TONS of pertinent examples that strip away many of the complexities that you've come to expect from higher-level math.
Calculus isn't particularly easy, but Jason teaches you that with the correct tools, you can understand anything.
I could go on and on about these DVDs, but here's a recommendation for you:  Get them now.  They are very, very good.",1251244800,3,1218,4.654205607476635
2467663,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Excellent! I never right reviews.  Watch the video, pause the video, work out the problems along with the video.  This was a big help for me.  Just bought Advanced Calculus 2 Tutor, along with Calculus 3 Volume 1 & 2 Tutor.  Cal 3 Tutor, is only necessary if you are taking more than one semester of Calculus.",1242777600,,309,4.368421052631579
2467664,5,B000COQ9XQ,"This guy is a great teacher. If you ever want to make calculus make sense to you, get this dvd. The 2 days I spent watching it, contributed 10 times more to my understanding of calculus than the whole semester of Calculus in college.",1236124800,,233,4.318181818181818
2467665,5,B000COQ9XQ,"My first four weeks in my college cal class were an exercise in misery. My instructors did not speak enough English to answer questions, and they simply wrote out the problems the course coordinator gave them without explaining the concepts, so when I went to do the homework, I was completely lost. I was so frustrated because I could tell they were not difficult concepts, but left unexplained, I had no clue what I was doing. Class became something I went to solely to not miss any quizzes (which I made C's and below) because I learned more on my own--and I do not teach myself math and science very well at all. After my first test, I ordered these dvd's for 2-day shipping, I was so desperate. I left class one day nearly in tears because I didn't understand what he was talking about at ALL--I had never been so lost in my entire life. I received the dvd's that afternoon, and understood exactly what we had gone over in class earlier. Not only that, but it was EASY. I felt kind of dumb for not getting it sooner. I went from loathing Calculus to loving it--in about 1 hour.

Definitely purchase these if you either haven't had math in awhile (like me) or your instructor's teaching style does not match your learning style (also like me). WELL worth the money!!! The money I spent on the dvd's was probably much cheaper than what I would have spent on Advil and therapy. :)",1234224000,18,1382,4.440944881889764

As a father of two sons, I am very delighted that I found an easy source to teach my sons difficult topics very effectively. These DVDs are also good for people who have solid ground in math and physics because they can review their information very quickly.

Even better, use this before your lecture and have a headstart on the days topic.",1206921600,4,350,4.384615384615385
2467672,5,B000COQ9XQ,"Calculus is one of those things that make you feel either as an insider or an outsider. If you know it, you feel like one of the happy few. If you don't (but know of its existence), you develop some kind of complex against it.

Now, this DVD is made for many different kinds of audiences, including (mainly) high-school students, and (secondarily) freshmen college students in science or economics. I will give my opinion as someone quite different. I am:
(a) a social scientist, and not a hard-science freak at all;
(b) already past 30 years old -- i.e. already quite rigid -- and without a lot of time to spend studying; and
(c) someone who had always been afraid to hold his nose and jump into the deep waters of calculus (and was therefore missing a lot of the cutting-edge work in his discipline, but sour-grape-ly convincing himself that there are different ways to arrive at the same insights, etc).

SO, IF THAT HAD WORKED FOR ME, IT MIGHT WORK FOR MOST PEOPLE.

Well ... this DVD DID WORK FOR ME!!! I immediately stopped thinking of calculus as one of the worst things that ever happened to me at high school... The clue is not in calculus itself, but in the way it is simplified and taught. Gibson is more than just a teacher: he is a coach, and a great communicator of his love for maths.

IN ADDITION, THIS PRODUCES RESULTS QUICKLY: I bought this when it came out, because I needed to urgently re-tool. I was an ""informal"" political scientist, and I wanted to gain quickly (a) the ability to read technical papers, and (b) some insight into formal models that I could use. In other words, I was not the kind of guy who either felt comfortable with calculus, or who would easily praise a DVD on such things. WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF USING IT AT A RATE OF ONE HOUR A DAY, I HAD ACHIEVED MY GOALS!!! Gone were the days when I'd see a chain rule or a partial derivative and I would immediately turn my head the other way. Welcome are the days when I see it and I want to know more about it!

Of course, watching or even learning this will not allow you to start writing and solving your own models. (For that, you also need to practice a little bit more, by the calc III dvd, and, of course, read some book on theories, both mathematical and of your own science.) BUT THE TRICK IS ELSEWHERE: WATCHING THIS WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO DO THESE EXTRA EXERCISES, AND IT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO READ THE THEORIES YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

... TRULY, A GREAT PRODUCT!!!

PS. I can't wait until Jason Gibson publishes an equivalent series on statistics!",1205280000,5,2539,4.400852878464819
2467673,2,B000COQ9XQ,I bought this product thinking it would bring my calculus to a higher level.  It didn't.  The product covers the most basic examples which you can follow in your text if you are taking a class which would be the main reason you buy this DVD.  This product was not helpful in doing the higher number problems at the end of the chapters let alone the problems on tests which require insight and creativity.  This is the most basic of explanations of Calculus which most people should be able to follow in each chapter of their text.,1197590400,10,530,4.43298969072165
2467674,5,B000COQ9XQ,"I highly recommend this tutor's Algebra, Trig, Physics, and Calc DVD sets. The calculus set, like the others, gives one a no-nonsence step by step tutoring in Calculus 1.  I just love the fact that there is no annoying music and condescending skits to side track you (unlike other DVD math products).  All you get here is a white board and a guy churning away example after example that really brings home the point.

One caveat.  This set does not include Calc 2 - at least not the Calc 2 that I took back in 1972.

Excellent product.",1194825600,9,535,4.418367346938775
2467675,3,B000COQ9XQ,"I bought this having high expectations after reading other's comments about this dvd.  However, this DVD is so basic that I do not believe it would help the average user in their Calculus class much.  Although the instructor knows his stuff, his explanations are so basic and he gives no details into what you are doing that it leaves the students confused and lost.  The instructor also doesn't seem confident when solving problems so that you may be discourage from listening further.  Again, I believe this is a good basic, and I mean very basic review for calculus, if you are serious about learning the concepts there are much better (and often cheaper) books out there.  After being disappointed with the purchase of this DVD, I bought ""HOW TO ACE CALCULUS: The Streetwise Guide"" from Colin Adams, and found it to have much more usefulness.  It covers much more of the concepts that you will run in your calculus classes, is much clearer and the book is written so that it is easy to follow and it cost much less than half the price of this DVD.  And lastly, after having bought this DVD and reviewing all 8 hrs of the instruction twice, I went back to the reviews other's had written for this DVD and found that although it has a lot of 5 stars rating, most of the people doing those ratings had only rated this product.  Is it because somebody is trying to inflate this DVD's ratings?  I guess I'll never really know but just trying to warn people to be cautious.

2467677,5,B000COQ9XQ,"This 2 DVD set is a great review for basic calculus concepts. As others have pointed out, this set really is appropriate for Calculus I and does not pertain to Calculus II. It would be great if Jason produced a Calculus II DVD (or call it ""advanced"") for those of us who need more than what is provided in this basic set.

Although there is a plethora of review books out there, having a workbook or review book specific to the DVD set would also be a wonderful learning aid!

These DVD's (and the others produced by Jason) are concise, easy to understand and will help to clarify oft-used mathematical concepts. I would highly recommend these to anyone!

I learned the hard way that the topics in calculus build on each other and if you don't understand the early material you will definitely not be able to master the later stuff.  When I realized what was going on, I picked up a copy of this DVD, and after one single weekend of viewing some of the material on this DVD my understanding of this subject skyrocketed.

I think the reason is that the teaching style is so approachable...as you watch the teacher he actually makes you think that learning calculus is easy, which is a hard pill to swallow if you are struggling student as I was.  Once those barriers are broken down, and you begin to realize that it isn't that hard at all, my confidence began to soar and I was off and running.

I would recommended this DVD to anyone taking Calculus.  If you need some help like learning *how* to do the math without all of the repetitive lecturing then this DVD is for you.",1141776000,36,1049,4.348717948717948
