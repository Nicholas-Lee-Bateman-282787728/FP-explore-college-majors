8761508,5,B01FT6VQBG,I was able to get my 18 year old son to sit and watch this with me. That is a near impossible task. It is a really good story that has a happy ending. Well worth a watch.,1488499200,,170,3.5
8761509,5,B01FT6VQBG,"My Son and his wife and a friend made this movie which of course I am feel its wonderful.. But when he told me he was doing this I was not happy at all!!! But this was important to him and he had many people who help make this happen for him.. All funds raised 100% going to Cancer research and to the North Star Volunteer Fire Department.  There is some great picture of Alaska areas that I haven't even seen after living there for many years. Well worth the purchase and I am very proud of them making a planned completing it and raising money for such a great cause, plus my son meant one of his goals in life!",1482969600,,613,4.066115702479339
