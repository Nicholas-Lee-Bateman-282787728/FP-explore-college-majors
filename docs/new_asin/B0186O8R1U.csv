7541034,5,B0186O8R1U,"This is such an amazing deal for fans of Sailor Moon is North America. Not only do you get the updated animation, (which looks absolutely stunning) You're now also able to watch it with the English dub, as well as having all 14 episodes of the first arc in one box set instead of the 13 beautiful but costly Japanese releases that only had 2 episodes per box with all of them costing as much as this one set alone with of the episodes together. I'd say that's a pretty good deal! The only let down I can see so far is that it doesn't include the ""moon pride"" music box or charms like it's Japanese counterparts but in my opinion still worth buying.",1470009600,8,648,4.233870967741935

I've loved sailor moon  since the 90s, but I love Crystal so much more because it follows the beautiful original story as it was written in the manga. It's the story we were intended to have, not the edited, changed, and reconfigured for kids story that the 90s anime gave us.",1469318400,11,357,4.3283582089552235

7541037,5,B0186O8R1U,"I was always in love with the 90s version running home from school in pre-school and elementary just to catch the new episodes before they aired, and now owning the series on DVD. However, I had no idea a manga existed, and was different much different than the 90s version.

7541041,5,B0186O8R1U,"I was *really* dreading the English dub of this series, but honestly, I was impressed.  The majority of the voices were well chosen and didn't feel like nails on a chalkboard.  One of the things that I noticed was that they got the emotions right in many of the scenes.  I definitely would recommend both the subtitled and dubbed versions of this one.",1518739200,2,351,4.5396825396825395

7541051,3,B0186O8R1U,"I really wanted to like the updated Sailor Moon. And I did to a certain extent. However, I think they changed it way too much from the original. I was excited to see they had kept Zoisite a guy for this version until they decided to try and pair him with a Sailor Scout. Just no. They also made all the girls seem a lot more grown up and I always thought part of the charm was the immaturity of the (14 year old) girls.",1503532800,,419,3.9411764705882355

7541057,5,B0186O8R1U,wonderful reimmanging of a classic show and it stays very faithful to the manga instead of the original 90's cartoon which changed too many things to name but fans know of them already,1495929600,3,184,4.606060606060606
7541058,4,B0186O8R1U,"I loved Sailor Moon in the 90s while my friends were crazy about Dragon Ball Z. Though i had my complaints about that show this is a review for Crystal. If you watched the old show you already know what to expect here. The story and characters are all the same. I have two major gripes. One the actors. Most sound much older then the characters they portray. And i still remember and love the originals. Second is that alot of the humor isn't here. Usagi, or Serena in the states, doesn't go throught the range of emotions like in the original. On the positive the visuals are amazing with the cgi. The eyes are a little disproportioned, but they fixed that in later seasons. The show is also much shorter so it doesn't drag on to key plot points. It took 3 episodes to introduce Sailor Murcury for instance but here every episode introduces a new key character. It also stays truer to the manga so the names stay original. In the end i'd say the visuals beat out the dated look of the old show, but i felt the old show had better character development.",1494115200,,1053,4.350253807106599
7541059,3,B0186O8R1U,"I got this as a Christmas gift, because there is no way i would ever spend $60 on a bluray that had only 13 episodes. I don't know why it is so expensive, when i've seen other shows from people like Funimation put out 13 episode sets for like half that price. It couldn't even justify that price with its production quality, either. For one thing, the opening to each episode lazily uses the Japanese logo, when they clearly have an English logo right there on the box that they could've swapped in. But even worse then that, all of the credits in both the opening and closing are entirely in Japanese. This is the first DVD/bluray from Viz that i've ever owned, so i don't know if this is standard practice for them or something, but if i wanna, say, check a name in the cast credits or something, i'm out of luck. The dubbing itself is perfectly fine, but those other production screw-ups really do not justify the already inflated price on this. I'd like to get the recently released second volume, but i'm gonna wait for it to go on sale first, because if it's anything like this one, there is no way in heck i'm paying full price.",1491609600,,1135,4.3584905660377355

7541063,5,B0186O8R1U,I was so surprise when I walk into Wal mart and found this on a floor display. I had no idea that Crystal was release in the united states.  I love the much faster pace story plot of Sailor Moon Crystal compared to the 90s series and them using the Japanese names even in the dubbed version. The changes from old series  had me thrown for a loop as I could never guess what to expect with it being so topsy turvy darker compared to 90s Sailor Moon.  the ending of season 1 making it was directly into season 2  worked so well  that I have to look for season 2 either in local stores or here on Amazon.,1490140800,,601,4.016806722689076

7541067,5,B0186O8R1U,So I feel weird about giving this such a positive review I have never been a fan of Vizs casting for the new dubs and I strongly disliked Crystal when I was watching it in simulcast maybe the expectations at the time were too high for Crystal to meet it had been postponed when it first came out so people were restless and the animation at the time it was streaming was less than stellar. The Mars episode in its original simulcast form was really so bad it became meme worthy but the DVD has most of these problems fixed and for me personally being able to binge watch in English has made the show more watchable for me the first I watched it it was not worth waking up at ridiculous hours looking at a tiny screen to watch the rougher version but with most of the noticeably bad animation fixed and with the convenience of being able to not have to read sub's I feel much kinder towards the show. This release is nicer than Sailor Moon Classics first set too the menu is less cheap looking and so is the disc art. I couldn't justify getting the special bluray set it was out of my price range but this DVD set is pretty nice given the price point.,1486944000,,1150,4.208144796380091

7541087,4,B0186O8R1U,"Sailor Moon Crystal is a divided show. For someone like me I liked the new take of the show cutting out the monster of the week angle and just sticking with the major plot of the series. As such it has got less time for the more comedic aspects of the original show and pretty much blows through the entire Dark Kingdom story in 14 episodes. Animation also is a factor. When the series was first aired and streamed, it had many glaring animation flaws. A good portion of them were fixed before the DVD/Blu Ray releases though and I'm not one to nitpick on it. I think the new VIZ dub cast in this case was picked well and fits better in Crystal than the original series recent re-release. For die hard fans of the original series, Crystal may not be their cup of tea. The rail thin character designs, less comedy and overt focus on the romance between Usagi and Mamorou can be quite a difference. Plus some plot lines have been adapted from other sources besides the manga despite being focused on being a ""faithful"" adaption of it.

For me I rather like the update, and eagerly wait for the release of the Black Moon and Death Busters arcs",1475107200,3,1140,4.377358490566038
7541088,1,B0186O8R1U,"So the main reason I'm giving this 1 star isn't because of the series itself. I'm giving it 1 star because of the quality of this DVD set. Audio issues are everywhere. In the opening and ending the music is overpowering the singing and during certain times of episode 1 and 7 there is the same thing happening. Also during episode 1 towards the end the audio gets real quiet when Usagi is running away from her attackers. Also while I understand Viz trying to keep it as close to the Japanese version as possible, their streamed version on their website has the logo, and opening & ending credits in English, while the DVD set reverts back to the Japanese logo and credits. Also their streamed version has more official sibtitled signs in the episodes whereas the DVD set does not. Why should you be paying $30 for a box set of 14 episodes when a company can't properly convert episodes to a DVD?",1474848000,2,896,4.469512195121951

I also like the English dub and the voice actors are really good.  I have two books of the Manga and have read them more than once. I recommend this to any one who is a fan of Sailor Moon.,1474416000,,367,3.7051282051282053

7541094,5,B0186O8R1U,"Beautiful set! I did not purchase this from Amazon (sadly, I bought it in Best Buy, for about ten dollars more, it was a heat of the moment buy) but the Best Buy version is the same. It has the ""art book"" and the cards, and the DVD extra set as well. If I weren't a completist, I might gift the DVD versions to a friend. The Blu-Ray visual quality is stunning to me, not disappointing. I have the new original series releases as well (the ones actually released, only up to R, not the ripped ones from China) and the plot is almost exactly the same. It just moves faster in Crystal. There are far less filler episodes dealing with silly things, like Naru's relationships, Usagi's extra whining, Rei being competitive against Usagi a lot, etc. This version is more true to the manga and I love it. I also love the more adult content, such as the swearing. It makes it SO much more realistic. Overall, this is a great release. I kind of wish I hadn't paid for the Limited Edition and had just got the Blu-Ray alone, since I'm not much of a ""MUST HAVE SPECIAL VERSION!!!"" person, but I love it, and it was more or less worth it. If you love Sailor Moon, do not hesitate to purchase this awesome Limited Edition version with a book, cards, Blu-Ray discs, and DVD discs!",1473465600,,1265,4.319327731092437
7541095,5,B0186O8R1U,"This is a significantly re-written, updated version of the classic magical girl anime series.  It is a more serious treatment of the original material, with much of the silliness and many of the repetitious plot devices removed.  That said, there is still a considerable amount of comedy bordering on and occasionally becoming slapstick.  The characters are still the same iconic collection of five sailor guardians (Mercury, Venus [or V], Moon, Mars and Jupiter), two cats (Luna and Artermis), Tuxedo Mask (Prince Endymion, Mamo-Chan or whichever you prefer) and the various denizens of the Dark Kingdom.

The individual episodes are tighter, with stronger and more logical plot progression, and the entire series holds together better.  The conflicts are much the same as in the original but again without much of the silliness.  Conclusion is heart-warming and satisfying.

The tone of Crystal is more sober and even a bit dark at times, while retaining the entertaining nature of the original.  However, this might not be entirely appropriate for very young viewers.  Parental guidance is strongly recommended.  In all, this comes off much more as a main-stream story than as a children's fairy tale, although it still remains such.

Can't wait for the next installment of Crystal.  My highest possible recommendation for fans of anime and/or romantic comedy.",1473120000,7,1363,5.288372093023256
7541096,5,B0186O8R1U,"I have loved Sailor Moon since 2000. I love the classic anime and I love this series. When I was growing up I was able to read some of the Manga series. I think that Sailor Moon Crystal does a great job of interpreting that series. I do however wish that when Crystal first aired, that they had this animation, instead of what I refer to as the ""derpy animation"". This complete set's animation is so much nicer than what aired on Hulu. This is the collector's edition, so yes the price is high. I think it's worth it. The new voice actresses for the English dub, in my opinion are better than the 90's version, but I still prefer the Japanese voice-acting, so I will probably stick to that.",1473033600,,690,4.315384615384615

I have watched it a lot since I got it and honestly while I think the new dub of the original anime is boring (yes I've watched it and I just can't get into it like I did the original dub by DiC, sorry but DiC did make the show more exciting, think it was the music also the video quality is awful, it's no lie people are not joking that the quality sucks!) but this I just love it! The music is amazing! I sing along to Moon Pride the quality is amazing and the story just touches my heart and I just cry every time I watch Sailor Moon Crystal! Thank you so much Viz for this! I'm still waiting for a rerelease of the original dub by DiC (hey a guy can dream right?) but in the meantime I have Sailor Moon Crystal to enjoy so definitely get this!

7541104,5,B0186O8R1U,"As an avid Sailor Moon fan for nearly 20 years it's been a long (and often frustrating) journey trying to obtain even the most basic merchandise in North America. Now, having only recently emerged from a full decade of licensing famine, the world is in the middle of a fully fledged Sailor Moon renaissance. Wave after wave of every conceivable type of new merchandise has been flowing out of Japan as if sourced from the silver crystal itself. The classic anime has been re-licensed across the globe and given a fresh, uncut dub for the English speaking world. That's something most people never thought would happen. And at long last, this shiny new anime is in production. In short- there's never been a better time to be a follower of the Moon Princess than right now.

But I'm here to talk about Crystal. Oh- Sailor Moon Crystal! First announced 4 years ago during the Summer of 2012 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sailor Moon franchise, it would be a full two years until the final product would grace our screens via a number of internet streaming services. Immediately touted as a fresh adaptation which would adhere closely to the original manga and utilize the latest technologies to bring the story to life, the as-yet untitled project quickly became the most anticipated anime in recent memory. Indeed, the new series generally succeeds in both of these areas. Individuals like myself who have worn out their various copies of the manga over the years will appreciate the almost religious adherence to the source material along with the generally gorgeous animation. Though not without the occasional deviance, most episodes play out like a 1:1 adaptation of each issue or ""act"" as they are called. Gone here are the filler episodes of yester-yore. Gone are the ""Rainbow Crystals"" and all other plot elements fabricated for the classic series in order to increase the episode count. And yet this is mostly a good thing. What we are left with is pure story and a heaping amount of action.

One aspect I found particularly fun is that instead of being bombarded with (albeit beautifully animated) stock animation sequences, we're now treated to a mixture of real-time combat along with the attacks we all know by heart. This was something I found sorely missing from the original and have found immensely satisfying in this new incarnation. That's not to say Crystal has arrived without its share of controversies. In example, the new senshi/guardian transformations are rendered in cell shaded CGI to give an overall 3D effect. It's mostly lovely but also a jarring departure in style from the rest of the series. Another chief complaint is that without the copious amounts of filler episodes we're accustomed to, our main characters have less time to believably develop as both individuals and close friends. It's true, the supporting character-focused episodes are sorely missed. And despite the fact that we're still given a strong grasp of each senshi's background and personality traits, I can't help but feel my emotional investment in these characters still stems in large part directly from my history with the original show. Perhaps the main flaw of Crystal, however unusual, is that it's almost *too* plot focused. Events move at such a fast pace that it's somewhat to the detriment of all characters not named Usagi Tsukino. But only somewhat. At the end of the day it's important to remember that this is her story and thus she takes center stage. Rightfully so.

Now on to the elephant in the room. After the initial premiere of each episode in the first season, some viewers were quick to point that certain shots looked rushed or at times even slightly unfinished. Unfortunately in the world of anime production deadlines take precedence over all else. Delivering the episode on time is understandably #1. Because of this the final product can indeed suffer. This affects all animated series, especially a special effects-laden extravaganza like Sailor Moon Crystal. To be clear the premiere versions did not look terrible. In fact no matter how you look at it Crystal is a gorgeous show. But in the age of HD displays even minor errors can stick out like a sore thumb to astute viewers. Fortunately I'm happy to report that what you will see on this blu-ray release is a drastic improvement over anything currently streaming online.

Prior to the blu-ray release Toei went back to each and every episode with a fine toothed comb to give this series the final polish it so richly deserves. Countless shots have been re-animated and dramatically refined. Unfinished visual effects have been corrected and replaced. A show that has become infamous over the past two years for its wonky character close-ups now shines even brighter under scrutiny. Don't take my word for it, there are comparison guides galore across the web which can give you an idea. Truthfully though it's mainly in motion that the improved visuals really shine and there's no better way to experience that than on HD blu-ray. This is the finished package with an excellent transfer. Any complaint that I may have had from an animation quality standpoint has gone right out the window.

Audio is presented in uncompressed 2.0 stereo for both the original Japanese and the excellent English dub. For a stereo track it's a powerhouse, but I must admit to being slightly disappointed with the lack of a 5.1 option that takes fuller advantage of blu-ray's capabilities. Not worth subtracting a star because what's here is truly excellent - however it does feel a bit like a missed opportunity for such a new production. My one minor quibble with this set.

Set one comes housed in a beautiful foiled-embossed chipboard box that looks absolutely stunning in person. Also in the box is a very nice series guidebook filled to the brim with detailed character and item designs, background layouts, interviews, episode summaries, and more. Definitely worth reading all the way through. Finally, we have a set of glossy character cards for each senshi, Tuxedo Mask, and Princess Serenity. This is a true collector's piece that reflects the look and design of the Japanese blu-ray sets. Speaking of those Japanese sets, at around $75 per set they were relegated to a mere 2 episodes each. Insane. This made the entire first season a cost prohibitive venture for most. But here we receive the first 14 episodes in their entirety for a fraction of the cost. That's the entire Dark Kingdom story arc!

Bottom line: Sailor Moon Crystal is a great show for both longtime fans of Sailor Moon and newcomers. Fans won't be disappointed with the deluxe treatment Viz Media has provided in this gorgeous blu-ray release. The transfer is excellent and the limited edition packaging is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Get the box set now as once it's gone, it's gone forever. This release comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1472169600,111,6909,4.925321888412017

7541106,3,B0186O8R1U,Many Sailor Moon Fans are divided on Crystal. Some think SMC is fantastic and others think it is a major disappointment. This DVD set contains the Dark Kingdom Arc. This version of Sailor Moon is closer to the Manga than the previous Anime incarnation. It contains a dub that doesn't feature the voice actors from the 90s dub. Viz has new voice actors for their dub. Whether you like them or not is down to personal taste. If you want to know what you're getting watch Sailor Moon Crystal on Viz before you buy this or the blu ray edition. I however think Crystal is okay but could be better. I am looking forward to the rest of the series being released on DVD and Blu Ray.,1471737600,9,674,4.31496062992126

Sailor Moon Crystal isn't better or worst then the Original SM.  Sailor Moon Crystal is for fans that want a series that is closer to the manga and accept the fact that Naoko Takeuchi wrote the series like Josei manga pace instead of the Shoenen/Sentai pace normal manga/anime is adapted from.",1532044800,2,352,4.661290322580645

The two obvious things are that the episodes are MUCH shorter and there isn't a lot of light-hearted comedic moments like all the episodes made for the US. I never read the manga so while some portions might find familiarities, some of it might be new. The characters and  the story are portrayed with a LOT more seriousness and emotions. I also think it goes into the story and history in a bit more depth and I can see why some of it was watered down in the English versions of the original Sailor Moon cartoons catered to North America. But I felt a lot more goosebumps from this version than I did the DIC version.

The animation and the transformations are absolutely stunning.

I think girls like me who grew up with the silliness and light-heartedness of Serena/Usagi and the Sailor Scouts, who are now adults, can fully appreciate the more mature aspect of Sailor Moon Crystal while also having a strong sense of nostalgia.",1530662400,,1040,4.545454545454546
