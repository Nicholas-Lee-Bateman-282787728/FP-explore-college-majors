7283136,4,B00ZJYJCWY,"""Mighty Joe Young [1949]""---NOT to be confused with a recent remake--- is available as a single Blu-ray, a-n-d,
as a quarter of Warner's new ""Special Effects"" box set that, also, includes ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"";
""Son of Kong""; and, ""Them!"". I suggest jumpin' the shark, and just buying the mega-collection... that IS on four
BDs, and is cheaper, per disc.",1447200000,4,364,4.983606557377049
7283137,4,B00ZJYJCWY,"""Mighty Joe Young""(1949) has always been a favorite of mine ever since I saw it for the first time when I was a young boy. I've seen it many times over the years but there were two things that I always remembered about the film. One was the song ""Beautiful Dreamer"" which Terry Moore's character plays on the piano while being held aloft by Joe Young on a rotating stage and the famous fire at a children's orphanage that gave me nightmares as a kid. ""MJY"" was the second sequel from RKO about a giant ape from the same producers that unleashed ""King Kong""(1933) sixteen years earlier. But a lot had changed in America since ""King Kong"" took the country by storm. America had fought a long war in both Europe and the Pacific and the public wanted more realistic films that they could relate to and consequently, ""MJY"" was a failure at the box office. Things have certainly changed over the years with most critics and baby boomers alike singing it's praises. Warner's Home Video(which owns the RKO film catalog) has now brought ""MJY"" to Blu-ray for the first time and the results are very impressive. Although the OCN(original camera negative) of the film no longer exists, Warner's was able to re-master the film in 2K from a nitrate based fine-grain positive with a very high bitrate(34.85) and results are simply stunning. Interior and exterior scenes of the actors are vivid in B & W with close-ups especially impressive with even the smallest details(costumes, props, etc.) being crystal clear. The many special effects scenes whenever Joe Young is on the screen are really highlighted with the matte paintings, front and rear projection and stop motion animation of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen looking all the more impressive now on Blu-ray. Viewers can clearly see all of Joe Young's facial expressions and will sympathize with him all the more as he is exploited and then abused by everyone until the final climatic scene at a children's orphanage that is engulfed in flames. The film's  B & W cinematography abruptly changes to a reddish orange tint during this scene which makes it all the more effective and frightening. The story itself is tongue-in-cheek and contains many slapstick routines but is fun to watch. The actors(Terry Moore, Ben Johnson, Robert Armstrong and Frank McHugh) have a great time throughout the film and don't seem to take the proceedings all that seriously. As Time magazine said in it's review, the film is ""practically irresistible"" and even more so now on Blu-ray. ""Mighty Joe Young"" is 94 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish. The Audio is: DTS-HD MA English mono, Dolby Digital English and Dolby Digital Spanish. Special features include commentaries by actress Terry Moore and special effects veterans Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston; two featurettes with Ray Harryhausen and the theatrical trailer. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in an eco-cutout case so anyone purchasing this title may want to switch to a more solid Blu-ray case for added protection. Please note that in addition to  ""Mighty Joe Young"" being available as a stand alone Blu-ray, it is also one of four films that is available in Warner's new ""Special Effects"" box set that includes ""Son of Kong"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" and ""Them!"". Warner's new Blu-ray of the classic ""Mighty Joe Young"" is enjoyable from start to finish and should be a welcome addition to any home film library. It comes highly recommended.",1446940800,13,3504,4.947368421052632
7283138,4,B00ZJYJCWY,"Willis Obrien and Ray Harryhaussen worked together on this movie.  This was Ray's first movie he worked on doing most  of the stop motion effects.  Robert Armstrong stars in this movie as night club entertainer.  He travels to Africa to capture lions for his night club attraction. He discovers a 10 foot gorilla named Joe and attempts to capture him for his night club attraction.  Joe his brought to the night club and performs on stage, but is teased by people.  Some drunken customers go and tease Joe in is cell and goes on a destructive rampage. You really feel bad for Joe.  Good special effects and heart warming story.",1446595200,,627,4.6454545454545455

7283149,5,B00ZJYJCWY,"The fanciful adventures of a very lovable giant ape -- from the same daffy rascals who, about a decade earlier, gave the world KING KONG -- ""MJY"" is a sentimental tale of an overgrown gorilla tamed (as was Howard Hughes in ""real life"") by gorgeously fabulous Terry Moore wearing a slinky dress -- and playing ""Beautiful Dreamer"" on the piano in a gargantuan night club. Oh the song is sooooo soothing. But only to a point. Taunted by vicious drunks, Joe goes on a rampage in Hollywood, as so many big stars have done, finally redeeming himself in an astonishing, color-tinted finale faithfully restored for this impeccable Blu-Ray humdinger.  Beautiful dreamer, beautiful movie, beautifully unbelievable in the gratifying and liberating way that great old movies could be--- even great old B movies, actually. An essential entry in the fantasy life of every movie-loving kid, to be seen in childhood and then returned to, gleefully and gratefully, when turning into an adult robs you of many escapist wonders. Many, yes, but not ""Mighty Joe Young""!",1453161600,2,1048,5.022988505747127
8720427,5,B00ZJYJCWY,"Seeing this Blu-ray is the closest experience I've had to seeing a 35mm print at a theatre.  The film is a joy to behold, with the crispest images ever to come to home entertainment. The movie is charming and thrilling as we follow the adventures of Mr. Joseph Young of Africa, a ten foot tall gorilla and the girl he adores. The stop-motion was designed by the legendary Willis O'Brien (KING KONG 1933) and executed by Ray Harryhausen, who became a legend himself with JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, CLASH OF THE TITANS, etc. This is a must-see for fans of special effects films.",1533513600,,574,4.572815533980583

8720431,5,B00ZJYJCWY,Mighty Joe Young looks amazing considering the age of movie. The disc gives you a choice of Spanish or English and is set for English. The Blu-ray I received would only play Spanish not English. Hope the replacement is okay. 02/22/2018. Received another copy of MJY and it had same defect as first. Every item listed on Blu-ray works except English audio playback. There is no sound. Probably from the same bad lot. Will ask for refund and order at later date. The person that stated there are no subtitles is wrong. There are subtitles in all languages listed.,1519171200,2,561,4.6767676767676765
8720432,4,B00ZJYJCWY,"The production values are the best thing about ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1949), if you ask me. The story's fine, though the film seems mostly intended as (1) a happier version of ""King Kong"" (1933), wherein the girl and the ape are friends from the start and---spoiler alert---things don't end so tragically; (2) a framework on which to hang a series of exciting action sequences, with less of ""Kong's"" thematic richness; and (3) the vehicle with which RKO's special-effects crew, headed by ""Kong's"" Willis O'Brien and a young Ray Harryhausen, perfected the technical innovations of films like ""Kong"" and ""The Lost World"" (1925). It's a cuter film, more family friendly and less racially problematic, but lacks the same primal bite. Though superior from a strictly technical standpoint, it feels more like a product of its time.

For all that, it's a benchmark of effects-driven films and an entertaining sit; and if nothing else, Joe himself---as a character AND as a special effect---is pretty darn riveting.

If you're already a fan of this film: by all means, make the upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray. The picture quality here is breathtaking throughout, it sounds good, and all special features from the DVD are accounted for.",1508976000,3,1221,5.03960396039604
