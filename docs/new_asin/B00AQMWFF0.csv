8556492,4,B00AQMWFF0,"First and foremost this DVD picture quality is VHS caliber. It's like they found the best VHS print of the film and put it on DVD. There's no enhancements what so ever, even in the audio. You have to turn the volume way up to hear the people talk. The film takes place mostly at night so it's kinda hard to see. But at least the extras like trailers and commentary is available.

OK..So the movie is about a gang that beats up and kills this old Chinatown store owner for his secret stash. But, they have no luck finding it and leave the scene. The old mans daughter and boyfriend finds out he's dead and have a funeral and so on. At the funeral these men come and use magic on the body to resurrect him into a vampire. The vampire seeks revenge..it's a pretty funny little movie. It's always action on the screen, funny characters, and doesn't drag on. I just wish the picture quality was better.",1383350400,5,897,4.3076923076923075
