8274261,2,B0019K9U2Y,"The Killer Forehand video is the shortest video in Nick Bollettieri's instruction series, and maybe you don't need an hour to hammer out valuable tips but this video barely makes use of even half of its 30min length.

Nick Bollettieri says it all in his book, ""most players tend to hit forehand as often as possible"".  It's a critical shot to master, so why did they underdeliver in the accompanying video?

I can tell from the other videos, this series was done video-by-video with no plan of attack.  The Killer Forehand video was done from the ""whimsical-fun-for-kids"" approach with a ton of not-that-funny humor attempted constantly throughout.

Vital concepts like grip, footwork and some technical aspects of swing are discussed, but very briefly.  It almost seems like Bollettieri is more excited about Xavier Malisse than he is about teaching anything about the forehand.

The Killer Forehand is a flop; this is the stroke to learn, but it's treated like a joke the entire half-hour this video runs.  Thankfully they start figuring things out as the other videos in the series offer far more instruction and information.",1332979200,,1128,5.026881720430108
8274262,3,B0019K9U2Y,"Positives:
1. Offensive open stance forehand.
2. Offensive neutral stance forehand.
3. General footwork techniques (not specific to forehand).
4. Court positioning/basic court geometry (not specific to forehand).

Negatives:
1. Killer Forehand could have greater emphasis on the technical details of the open stance forehand, e.g. how and when to jump, how and when to use hip rotation, differences between defensive technique versus offensive technique, differences among various follow through motions.
2. The numerous annoying clown acts combined with inadequate scene selection from the menu makes the video hard for me to tolerate re-watching multiple times.
3. The video doesn't explain how to compensate for low versus high balls, short versus deep balls, or fast versus slow balls. The video over emphasizes taking big swings, which I believe may result in inexperienced viewers hitting a lot of unforced errors.

Bollettieri also covers footwork and court positioning in his much better&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nick-Bollettieri-s-Stroke-Instruction-Series-Bollistic-Backhand-DVD/dp/B0019I9OGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nick Bollettieri's Stroke Instruction Series: Bollistic Backhand DVD</a>&nbsp;video.

Overall the video has a lot of good content, but for me the material was easier to learn from the combination of Bollettieri's Bollistic Backhand and USPTA's Modern Forehand, which effectively made Killer Forehand an unnecessary purchase.",1300665600,6,2293,7.980392156862745
8274263,3,B0019K9U2Y,"Will give three stars.  Video incorporates goofy scientist character which might be entertaining for children < 16 years age, but annoying to me.  Wish that the video had some commentary directed at the novice player to emphasize basics regarding swing mechanics and creation of low-to-high swing pattern with topspin.  Overall, the Bollistic Backhand video in this instructional series did much better job taking time to explain the backhand swing, and this video on the forehand is not quite of the same quality.",1282435200,3,514,5.2439024390243905
8274264,2,B0019K9U2Y,"The video is 30 minutes.  In those 30 minutes, there are maybe 7 minutes of worthwhile advice and instruction; the other 20+ are a bunch of gargabe.  Most of it sounds like an ad for the Nick B. tennis academy, and there are way too many shots of one of his students, xavier malisses, hitting forehands w/ no shirt on.",1281744000,5,318,4.283333333333333

8274266,5,B0019K9U2Y,This product matched or exceeded my expectation. It clearly shows the right move in details. I have private tennis lessions for many years but I can learn more from the video. The video is better suited to advance players. You can really learn the essential in hitting the ball if you can play slow motion in that part of the video.,1254268800,5,332,4.459016393442623
