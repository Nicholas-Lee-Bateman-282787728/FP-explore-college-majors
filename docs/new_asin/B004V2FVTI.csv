8442604,4,B004V2FVTI,One of the very few multi star movies Rajesh Khanna has done- Dharam Kanta is one of them. Here RaajKumar and Jeetendra are with him in this movie. RaajKumar playing the role of his father and Jeetendra of his lost brother. This is a lost and found formula movie with some good songs by Naushad for a change in a Rajesh Khanna movie and no Kishore Kumar songs in the movie. The movie at times is melodramatic with loud dialouges and loud acting but is tolerable because both the actors Raaj Kumar and Rajesh Khanna have their style of acting. Jeetendra is washed away between them. Amjad Khan also has a big double role and looks huge and terrifying. Waheeda Rehman is there too. An entertainer which was an average success may be due to the fact that the theme was very common by then. It is a time pass which has to be seen for the stylish acting of RaajKumar and Super Star Rajesh Khanna.,1305763200,,891,4.373493975903615
