I would give this product five stars except for the fact that I have now ordered it twice, and each time it has arrived with at least one defective DVD.  I would very much like to have the product if someone out there can guarantee a defect free series of discs.",1469750400,,304,4.135593220338983
7905016,1,B000006S5F,This Films of Faith Volume 2 collection would have been a good value but there is not enough Kevin Spacey or Terry O' Quinn.  The Reason I bought This Set Is Because Spacey and O'Quinn look the same and I thought O'Quinn was Spacey in the Classic Film Blind Fury with Rutger O Hauer which I also bought on amazons.  Very good films just not enough Kevin or Terry praise god,1443916800,,373,4.23943661971831
