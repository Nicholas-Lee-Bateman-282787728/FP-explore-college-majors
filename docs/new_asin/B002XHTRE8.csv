4009061,4,B002XHTRE8,"I really enjoyed this one.  I have also been watching the telenovela on tv and see that there is a lot missing from the DVD.  The story is still there, but I would have enjoyed having the dvd version with everything included.  I would even be willing to pay more to have it in total.  If I hadn't seen it in the telenovela form on tv I would not have noticed that anything was missing except that some things happen on the dvd that seem to need a little more explaining.",1264377600,7,470,4.131868131868132

4009072,4,B002XHTRE8,"En nombre del amor (In the Name of Love - 904 minutes)

After her parents' death, Paloma is forced to live with her two spinster tias (aunts), glamorous Carlota and pobrecita Macarena, whose lover has been muerto durante muchos aos. Actually, he lived, but had been told SHE was dead... so HE became a priest!

Melodrama rules! The aunts guard a secret that could change everything for Paloma and the entire family. Tia Macarena is kind and loving while Tia Carlota seems to enjoy making Paloma`s life miserable. The murderous Carlota is responsible for ending Paloma`s relationship with Inaki.

Just when she was about to give up on love, Paloma falls for Emiliano which could mean trouble since he is her best friend's boyfriend, and of course Carlota hates him.

Paloma is in (Catholic) high school throughout most of this story, so she is a pedophile's dream, strolling around in her short little green-plaid pleated skirt, long white socks and a ponytail.

You can get this from Amazon.com.",1372982400,,995,4.898809523809524
4009073,1,B002XHTRE8,"Since I have seen only a small part of this wonderful telenovela on TV, I was excited to see it available through Amazon.  Unfortunately, there was no indication on Amazon that this is an extremely condensed version of the soap opera and that there are only 4 DVDs (for a daily soap that lasted 8 months!).  Everything seems to happen very rapidly, as if we were watching the titles of chapters rather than a continuous story. What a disappointment!  If the DVDs are your first attempt to view En Nombre del Amor, you will not enjoy this version.  If you have seen some or all of this soap on TV, you'll be very disappointed with the DVDs.  Either way- it's not worth buying.",1364688000,,675,4.455284552845528
4009074,3,B002XHTRE8,"The DVD release of this series is abridged from the original television broadcast.  That being said, my wife still likes it.",1364256000,,124,4.904761904761905
4009075,3,B002XHTRE8,"I love this novela. The packaging and everything is good, but they cut out so many scenes! If you have a favorite scene from this novela then chances are they aren't in the DVD! I think this product is good but it was disappointing to see so many things missing.",1353801600,,262,4.26
4009076,3,B002XHTRE8,I had seen this on Univision in it's entirety and became caught up with it. Super novela. Unfourtunetly it was so chopped up and condensed for DVD purposes like so many others it was just ok. Others are worse. But Thankyou.,1353542400,,223,4.463414634146342
4009077,5,B002XHTRE8,"I haven't watched it yet, but my wife has, and she absolutely loved it so I am equally satisfied with it. I shall watch it soon. Thank you.",1353283200,,139,4.0
4009078,3,B002XHTRE8,"No me gust&oacute; mucho porque la protagonista principal hizo cosas horribles. La compr&eacute; porque dec&iacute;a Laura Flores, pero ella ten&iacute;a un papel insignificante.",1349654400,2,178,6.782608695652174
4009079,5,B002XHTRE8,"It's also got great actors, plot, evilness, love, betrayal, friendship, etc.

On the technical note, however, the DVD pauses when scenes change and I'd miss the subtitles.

It's still a 5 star movie worth watching!

The soundtrack is also amazing... it's been a while since I've heard an excellent soundtrack from the telenovelas.

American movies just aren't even 1/10th as good as this movie.",1309132800,,394,5.109375
4009080,2,B002XHTRE8,"This DVD set is an abridged set of the telenovela ""En Nombre del Amor""..For brevity they edited down the series to the bare bones...The best parts are left out...Not sure why they did it but it ruined it for me... It's kind of like when you read a book and then see the movie about it...Not the same..",1309132800,2,301,4.206896551724138
4009081,4,B002XHTRE8,"Me Gusto Mucho este Dvd, los Resumenes Contienen Lo Mejor de la Telenovela. El Dise&ntilde;o esta Muy Bonito, los Discos y demas. La Actuacion de Leticia Calderon es Exelente, Magistral, una de las Mejores Villanas. La Historia es Muy Buena, y el Desarrollo de la misma esta bien compactado en el Dvd. Contiene la M&uacute;sica Original, la Entrada y las Canciones de Laura Pausini tal cual como se Transmitio en Television.
Este es uno de los Dvds m&aacute;s largos que han editado hasta el Momento, tiene un Resumen de 15 horas y esta Editado en 15 Capitulos de 1 hora. Como todas las Telenovelas en Dvd son resumidas y le faltan muchas escenas pero en este caso me encanto la Edicion y no tengo nada que criticar. Tube la oportunidad de verla en Television y al ver el Dvd pense que al no tener las escenas de Rufi con Carlota, despues de atropellar a Arcadia no se iba a entender, pero fue lo contrario, hay una escena de Rufi en un Flashback que al recordar lo que hablo con Carlota, se entiende perfectamente lo que paso y me encanto eso. Es una buena opcion para cuando quitan una escena y luego se puede ver de esa forma dentro de otra, sin perder el hilo de la historia.",1303257600,8,1179,4.43778801843318

8383681,4,B002XHTRE8,"They cut out several episodes from the original run. However, the series is still wonderfully written, shot, and acted.",1501804800,,119,5.315789473684211
8383682,5,B002XHTRE8,"I want to add my vote to those who enjoyed this first-rate telenovela DVD, which features a terrific story line, and many interesting sub-plots, along with a wonderful cast.

My main reason for posting, though, is to remind people who are wondering whether to buy this telenovela DVD that it is *not* the full version that aired on TV.  As is clearly noted in the Amazon listing, and on the DVD packaging itself, the at-home DVD version is about 14 hours long.  [Do you really think you're going to get 170 full episodes, with more than 120 hours of viewing time, for less than $10?  Come on now ...]  In other words, you'll see only about 12% of the full telenovela as shown on TV in prime time.  However, I think the DVD editors did a very good job condensing the telenovela in a way that allows you to easily follow the plot line and have a five-star viewing experience.  I sure did.",1501286400,,886,4.398773006134969

8383686,4,B002XHTRE8,"This was a super fun telenovela.  I like the English subtitles.  The evil aunt villan, Carlota is classic and the young characters make it fun, rather than trying to have older actors play young people, like in other telenovelas.",1474156800,,229,4.846153846153846
