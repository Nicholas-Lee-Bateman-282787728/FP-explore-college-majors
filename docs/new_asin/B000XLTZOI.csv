8228738,5,B000XLTZOI,"We got this as a part of the original TBN four pack. This one is our favorite. the Twister and Shout episode is really good when the kids are stuck in a tornado without their parents and turn to God for strength to get through. Its a great lesson, and my five year old and I watch it a lot. It is one of our favorites.  The one we had is broken, so we ordered it again used. I have not got it yet, but hoping it works well.  It was worth paying almost $10 for a used one.",1347580800,3,471,3.7474747474747474
