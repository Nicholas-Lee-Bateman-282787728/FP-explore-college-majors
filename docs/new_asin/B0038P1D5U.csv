8391661,2,B0038P1D5U,"The headline quote is about as good as the dialog gets in Murder in Fashion.

In July 1997, much of the USA was riveted by the nonstop media coverage of the search for spree killer Andrew Phillip Cunanan (often inaccurately referred to as a serial killer).  I well remember seeing a poster with several photos of Cunanan (described as a ""master of disguise"") hanging in a local gay nightclub a week before the murder of Gianni Versace.  Television's talking heads played armchair analyst, trying to piece together how the prep-school graduate, described as well read and sophisticated, became a drugstore clerk and San Diego party-boy/rent-boy, ruined his life and wound up deeply in debt - before going on a murder spree.

Unfortunately, Murder in Fashion doesn't bother to dig beyond the shallows, skipping much of the information imparted in the brief paragraph above.  Thus, there is no perspective given to Cunanan's downfall because at the start of the film, he has already fallen.  Matters are not helped by the superficially pretty but only marginally talented Jonathan Trent, whose ""performance"" alternates between psychotic hissy fits and clumsy attempts at seduction.  Only James C. Burns as FBI agent Harry Spalding (a fictional character), and Robert Miano as an aging, weary Versace - are able to deliver something approaching three dimensional portrayals.  The primary blame for the paucity of decent acting, dialog, story line, and clumsy pacing, must go to writer Linda Boroff and director Ben Waller.  The lack of a strong script or direction yields unintended results.  For example, a scene involving a desperate Cunanan in drag, trying to score drugs, which should be tragic, is an unintended howler.  This is par for the course for Here! TV, known for low quality productions which feature plenty of skin (not in this case however) at the expense of content - so maybe I was expecting too much.

At this late date, it seems unlikely a quality film will ever be made about the Andrew Cunanan story.  This is a pity, as it could be a cautionary tale worth watching.  Those interested in the real Cunanan will have to content themselves with the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Month-Fever/dp/0060931124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Month Fever</a>&nbsp;by Gary Indiana.",1289779200,3,2346,5.356948228882834
8391662,2,B0038P1D5U,"[Note: This appears on IMDB as ""Fashion Victim,"" and is NOT to be confused with the 2007 German film that translates as ""Fashion Victims"", which is a romantic comedy.]

In 1997, self-loathing yet narcissistic, fading ""boy-toy"" Andrew Cunanan went on a murder spree from Minnesota to Florida, where he eventually shot and killed gay designer Gianni Versace, whom he had fantasized would make him a famous model.  The film provides a perfunctory look at Cunanan's life and motivations, introduces and then quickly dismisses others in his life, and concentrates too much on the feelings of the FBI agents trying to guess his next movement.  The end result is an unsatisfying, barebones screenplay that doesn't go anywhere, and fails to justify even its tiny indy budget.

Jonathan Trent plays Cunanan with equal parts campy flirtatiousness and psychotic menace, and his portrayal really doesn't tell us anything about the serial killer that the newspapers haven't already said.  This 2008 release from Here! TV/Regent Films is just now out on DVD.  Some may add a star for the ""eye candy"" element (Trent in rated R sex trysts), but I can't see this as more than 2 stars out of 5.",1278374400,,1176,4.944162436548224
8391663,3,B0038P1D5U,"This interpretation of the months-long murder spree of Andrew Cunanan that culminated in the killing of fashion icon Gianni Versace, followed by Cunanan's suicide, was the stuff of headlines back in 1997. It still brings shudders to watch handsome young actor Jonathon Trent dive into this role. The movie plays out on two levels: the murders themselves, and the device of FBI agent Harry Spalding who tracks Cunanan --- a cynical, frustrated and bitter man, past his prime, who is given the responsibility but not the authority to bring the spree to an end. For instance, (the movie fictionalizes all of this) Spalding, whose insights and good guesses make him the best chance to bring Cunanan in, is sent off across the country on a chore of interviewing the family, when he is aching to go east, to New York or Florida, where he is sure Cunanan is heading after his murder of architect Lee Miglin in Chicago.

I found star Jonathon Trent's acting in this film to be a courageous interpretation of Cunanan; a difficult role to play, but Trent holds nothing back. Alternately playfully seductive and murderously organized, the narcissistic Cunanan is brought to life by Trent's acting. In this movie, Cunanan is portrayed as somebody whose fading looks and whose inability to get a foot in the door in modeling --- or get his ""fair share"" of money, all contribute to pushing him into homicidal fury against his friend Jeff Trail in Minneapolis, which starts the whole chase. It's not fair to speculate about people like Trail who can't defend themselves, but whatever misunderstanding of him Cunanan had, he certainly didn't deserve to die like that. In fact, it was creepy to think of innocent people going about their business who turned out to be victims just because Cunanan needed to steal a car and they were in the wrong place at the time.",1275004800,4,1847,4.826498422712934
