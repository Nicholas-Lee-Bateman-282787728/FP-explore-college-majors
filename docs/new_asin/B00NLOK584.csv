6667099,5,B00NLOK584,"Got this dvd from Amazon quickly and in fine condition. At last it has become available on DVD, and though it took a while, to me it is well worth the cost and waiting for. Film is a 1938-39 Warner Bros. Feature in glorious B&W, as were most movies from that era. Oh, if only it had been shot in technicolor as were a few later military themed and supported Warner pre-war films. (""Dive Bomber""-1941/Errol Flynn, etc.)  the U.S. Navy gave full support to this as well as other such features that were shot in the late '30s depicting the taxpayers money being put to good use.
These movies were good for recruitment as well as profits for the studios and entertaining. By today's standards, the plot is very simplistic, just a  weak love triangle soap opera held together by absolutely wonderful glimpses into the military services and hardware provided by the Navy. The three leads are George Brent, John Payne, and Olivia DeHavilland (as an American beauty!?) in the story of two Navy flier brother/rivals who fall for the same girl. It's a predictable plot and outcome. Also present is Frank McHugh bringing inane humor that would not be tolerated by any military service...hey, where are Cagney and O'Brian, his usual costars? The real stars are the gorgeous Navy aircraft and ships playing themselves at Pensacola and San Diego Naval Air Stations in 1938/39! That's what I wanted this dvd for in the first place!
 If your interests parallel mine, you'll want this movie too.",1426291200,12,1478,4.765625

6667101,4,B00NLOK584,"With sort of a soapy melodrama love triangle storyline, Wings of the Navy has many, many scenes of pre- World War II Naval aircraft that aviation buffs will enjoy.

I'm a big fan of John Payne and I like anything he's in. I've had this film on a bad taped-from-TV VHS tape for years so I knew the story line and knew what I was buying. It's one of those movies that you buy, watch and love because you like the people in it and sort of forgive the plot. I was finally glad to see a good print of it (as compared to my bad VHS tape). Needless to say, Olivia de Havilland is totally wasted in a role that any novice actress could've played.

This Warner Archives series DVD is bare bones with only the original trailer as an extra.",1422057600,8,729,4.126760563380282

6667108,5,B00NLOK584,"First, I'm Navy. Second, my father was an enlisted pilot (ADC/AP) in WWII and flew PBY-5 Catalina's literally from day one. He went to flight school at NAS Pensacola the year after the film was made so the story has some meaning to me. It was more of a ""what the pilots did as trainees"" than the background movie stories and plots that interested me, but the period aircraft were real for that day and age, 1939, and a treat to see and identify them. If there ever was a ""swashbuckling"" part of the US Navy, this was it. All that changed in December, 1941. After that date, what these pilots learned was put to use. There still is that ""attitude"".",1441152000,12,647,4.355371900826446

6667111,4,B00NLOK584,"In this 1939 B&W film, the romantic plot (Olivia de Havilland must choose John Payne or George Brent) is thin gruel.  The dramatic rivalry between two brothers in the Navy, both influenced by their Navy father  is too.  Frank McHughs corny humor provides some light relief.  The development of a new aircraft (the F3F) and its diving trials add a sense of danger to the film, and they lightly inform the moviegoer about progress in aviation medicine.

All these plot devices are, however, just bridges between gorgeous and thrilling flying scenes of naval aviation before World War II.  Other famous Navy aviation movies showcase the aircraft carrier.  This movie superbly shows seaplanes  the float plane model of the N3N and the big boat, the PBY Catalina.

For biplanes over Pensacola, launches from the beach, and pontoons on the waves  this is the film!

6667112,5,B00NLOK584,"A nostalgic and romantic  American movie, never seen before,  about the former US Naval Aircorps in the Thirties while the developed aircraft carriers where in a stadium of beginnings, the heavy battleships yet were the look a like mighty  flagships, even before the unexpected  dissasterous attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,  Dec 7, 1941
It showed me a rather naive mentality of American society for keeping out a treatening war, while the dark warclouds already spread out over Europe, and Japan started agressive provokings against China, ending into a complete war in the Far East.
Also very interesting the nostalgic biplanes and the well known Catalina flying boats. (for modellers they can looking on certain detailing points!)
Again a movie that shows me a certain part of the US Navy airframe history, what nowadays is a high technically developped US NAVY Airframe/ Marines on super nuclear flattops.",1436313600,6,908,5.191780821917808
6667113,4,B00NLOK584,"Spoilers!  Two brothers meet at a monument dedicated to their Naval father, which sets up the rivalry story between the younger submariner and the older aviator.  The younger and three other cadets meet on a train trip to Pensacola.  One washes out in the medical.  One represents Brazil's aspirations.  The two others see each other through flying school, piloting N3N floatplanes, with brief footage in a wheeled biplane and F4B fighter/bombers.  Along the way the younger falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, but they sacrifice themselves to keep the older going after he cracks up on a student check flight.

The two buddies opt for PBY flying boat training in San Diego, while the older continues to develop a better biplane (F3F).  His plane crashes during a test flight with the pilot killed,  The younger has been promoted in grade and is set to take part in a mass flight to Hawaii.  He sacrifices his commission to test his brothers plane to success.  The older persuades the Navy to take him back in to make the group flight, and persuades his girlfriend to meet the younger in Honolulu as he knows they love each other.

A bit too much comic relief in the first half,  Many shots of other biplanes like F3U, J2F, SBC and the NJ monoplane.  Problem of pilot blackout is examined much further in Dive Bomber.",1434499200,6,1326,4.708695652173913

8678928,3,B00NLOK584,"This might have been a great movie if it had been in color, and had a different cast. The movie follows a group of Navy Pilot trainees of the mid-late 1930's as they go through the Pre-WWII syllabus of training ( five squadrons, each aboard a different aircraft) . The visual highlights of the movie are the PBY flying boat ( not the later amphibian version) sequences. But in the meantime you have to endure the wooden performances of George Brent and John Payne as older and younger Pilot brothers in USN Aviation , with occasional appearances of Olivia DeHavilland ( fresh from her appearance in ""Gone with the Wind""  and probably wondering what she was doing in this turkey) as the focus of  the obligatory love Triangle ( Brent, Payne, DeHavilland) that keeps the movie limping along. Frank McHugh ( later Bing Crosby's Brother Priest in ""Going My Way"") tries desperately to inject some humor /visual comedy into the soggy script by falling into the bay, falling out of airplanes, getting wet ( Navy humor, I guess) etc.but fails.  As an aviation historian, I endured the ..uh..love.. sequences until the movie got back to the flight line and I could see N3N floatplanes (and land versions too), the unheard-of PBY interior cutaway scenes, and the Grumman F2F flight scenes for the Terminal Velocity Dive tests (with High-G pullouts, blackouts and unconscious pilots at the stick, of course) which made the movie worth seeing more than once. Recommended for hard core aviation historians.",1484006400,,1493,4.893280632411067

I fully appreciate the fact that these older movies don't justify the volumes to press a disc. But I would've been happy to pay the $2 more to have the disc burned on M-DISC to get it's 1000 year lifetime.

The movie itself had good quality and sound. 5 Stars.",1458691200,3,392,4.492957746478873
