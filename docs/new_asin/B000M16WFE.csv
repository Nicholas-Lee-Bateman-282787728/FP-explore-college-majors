2718027,4,B000M16WFE,"As a film,Joy House is a little dated, but it still manages to catch the attention and to hold it through to the final credits. Though not in the same class as Jean-Pierre Melville, director Rene Clement, does more than a servicable job with this crime thriller about a care-free hoodlum, played by French heart-throb Alain Delon, who in order to escape from a band of criminals and the police, is befriended and offered employment by a pair of ""odd"", attractive American women who live in grande style in  a magnificent villa the the south of France. Thinking he's got it made Delon soons begins to realise that he is caught in a web of which there is no escape. ""Joy House'' is well worth a viewing.",1365033600,,701,4.519685039370079
2718028,5,B000M16WFE,"The casting of Alain Delon with Jane Fonda and Lola Albright  in a darkish story about keeping your life, but at a price, is close to perfect. Each actor is beautiful and each one uses their own special beauty to hide the dark aspects of their characters. For Alain he is like Faust,and the Devil is represented by both Lola and Jane. And as in ""Plein Soleil"", also a Rene Clement film, the hero when he feels confident that he has got away with  his deception discovers that he has been exposed, and that the rewards he has been expecting will not be his, perhaps ever.",1355529600,,570,4.367924528301887
2718029,5,B000M16WFE,I'm sure that this film will never be rated as one of the finest bits of cinema but it was worth viewing.  A few laughs a bit of mystery and Jane Fonda who can be sexier fully dressed than most stars in a full blown sex scene.  I know some of you may not care for Fonda due to some of her political stands in the past but she is one of our better actresses.,1355356800,,357,3.7466666666666666
2718030,4,B000M16WFE,"""Les felins"" (""Joy House"") is a stylish thriller (in the ""nouvelle vague"" vein) set in the sunny French Riviera. Directed by auteur Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment (""Jeux interdits"" 1952, ""Gervaise"" 1956, ""Plein soleil"" 1960, etc.) and released in 1964. 'Marc' (the always cool and intense Alain Delon), is a con-man/playboy, on the run from American mobsters. After making a stunning escape (car off a cliff), he lays low for a while, in a local flophouse. When by chance, wealthy expatriate-American 'Barbara' (Lola Albright) and her cousin 'Melinda' (Jane Fonda), set eyes on him. They decide to hire him as their next chauffeur. Upon returning to their neo-gothic villa (overlooking the blue-Mediterranean), and after all formalities were dropped, 'Marc' started growing suspicious of the true motives of his beautiful benefactors!

This was a clever little tale of intrigue, deception, and betrayal, but there was something else being masked underneath it all. Could it be: the usurpation of power from the traditionally male-dominated role. Maybe, maybe not! While the storyline/plot wasn't fully developed, this was to the film's advantage, in offering its many twists and turns. Anyway, there's plenty of reasons to own this one.

First and foremost: master filmmaker Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment. Second: the excellent cinematography of Henri Deca, one of the foremost cinematographers of all-time. His signature style is unmistakable (this film and many others like it, were made in an ""Art & Style"", that has been all but forgotten). Third: the acting by Alain Delon, Lola Albright, and Jane Fonda were all very good. Ironic and low-key, with some well-placed humor (even the supporting cast, the script seemed to be lampooning the many spy-films of the era). Fourth: the cool-jazzy score by Lalo Schifrin. It's been a long time since I first saw this one in an Art-House theater (I literally used to live in those places!), when still in my early 20's. A worthy entry in every cinephile's collection. Select the French language version with English subtitles. The DVD picture quality by Koch Lorber Films is excellent and the film is in its proper aspect-ratio. NTSC, French (English subtitles), English language, NR 97 mins.

2718031,4,B000M16WFE,"1964 - Little known but really kind of cool, kind of creepy, kind of wacky - and not bad at all. If you're a 60s Euro-fan and/or early Jane Fonda fan - when she was still a Love Goddess and not a political icon - it's a definite must. I loved 'Purple Noon' so that got me to checking out some of Rene Clement's other work which is also good. Original French title Les Felins means ""The Cats"" - female cats - which makes a lot more sense.",1341187200,,437,3.977272727272727
2718032,4,B000M16WFE,"""Les Flins"" (in French, B&W, directed by Ren Clment; aka ""The Love Cage"" in the UK and ""Joy House"" in the US; staring Delon, Jane Fonda, and Lola Albright) has it all - a Robert Cummings-like 'starkly photographed narrow escape movie' (see ""The Black Book"", 1949, B&W) converted into a extremely fast-paced French movie mystery/thriller classic. It has sublime perfection at times with superb intimate dialogue between Delon and Albright. Their on-screen 'held firm & close in' kiss could singe your eyebrows (it may have melted the camera lens). She with direct longing intensity would beseech him, he would reply by kissing her face, cooing to her, quieting down her concerns, nibbling at her lower lip; she would give in partially (Why?), and he would then whisper to her like a devoted but careful lover.

Unsettling passion clearly makes for exciting moments when two actors cross that line into romantic oblivion. This tension between man and woman is so taut at times: it feels like a nylon hose is pulled over your head and you are suffocating while breathing in her perfume. It could kindle a long fire by the soft rug; this spilling of intimacy into the chase sequences. Exceptional drama like this deserves a reward, words of praise, a lifting of the veil to allow utterances that women cherish when whispered by a handsome paramour at the right time. Perhaps we observe unsubtle passion each time our hero escapes his pursuers and ends up speaking with gentle asides and direct eye contact to either woman, both of whom seem to love him in spite of his potential to be captured or killed at any moment - before their very eyes. May I add, ""Les Flins"" has impassioned performances, quick as a leopard movement by Delon, and superior cinematography.

This film clearly resonates an exact direction in plot when Delon's character overpowers his captor early on in Act I, careens an automobile off the cliff into the ocean depths while being shot at, and then swims like a fish through the undercurrent into the shadowed refuge of a dock; he races up the stairs and escapes death at the hands of men who seek to do him great harm. His movement, his agility, charisma, stature as a physical actor capable of exciting stunt work, and almost unbelievable Don Juan traits in between leaps and jumps - excites the viewer beyond any normal empathy; unless I am mistaken. Forgive me for being presumptuous.

Highly recommend this stunning film. It has subtle intent throughout, like a sapphire gleaming bright in the moonlight. ""Les Flins"" is so striking in its originality that one has to lean forward to avoid missing 'his eyes beseeching her or her eyes adoring him'.",1331424000,,2671,4.8402625820568925

2718034,4,B000M16WFE," Les Flins  (en franais, B&W, dirig par Ren Clment ; alias  La Cage d'Amour  dans le Royaume-Uni et  la Maison de Joy  dans les Etats-Unis ; dvisageant Delon, Jane Fonda, et Lola Albright) l'a tous - un Robert Comme < a photographi raidement le film d'vasion troit > (voit  Le Livre Noir , 1949, B&W) a transform en un classique de mystre/thriller de film franais extrmement rapide. Il a la perfection sublime de temps en temps avec le dialogue intime superbe entre Delon et Albright. Leur sur l'cran < a tenu l'entreprise & proche en > le baiser peut singe vos sourcils (il pourrait avoir fondu la lentille d'appareil photo). Elle avec l'intensit pleine de dsir directe le supplierait, il rpondrait en embrassant son visage, lui roucoulant, calmant ses inquitudes, grignotant  sa lvre plus basse ; elle donnerait en partiellement (Pourquoi ? ), et il lui chuchoterait alors comme un amant consacr mais prudent. Les femmes apprcient-elles en fait ce type d'attention ? Probablement. Devoir c'est inexprim de temps en temps ; je suppose si.

Ebranler la passion fait clairement pour exciter des moments quand deux acteurs traversent cette ligne dans l'oubli romantique. Cette tension entre l'homme et la femme est si tendue de temps en temps : il se sent comme un tuyau en nylon est tir votre tte et vous suffoquez en aspirant son parfum. Il pourrait allumer un feu long par le tapis doux ; ce renverser d'intimit dans les squences de chasse. Le drame exceptionnel comme ceci mrite une rcompense, un mots de louange, un soulever du voile pour permettre des dclarations que les femmes chrissent quand chuchot par un bel amant au temps juste. Peut-tre nous observons la passion peu subtile chaque fois notre hros chappe ses poursuivants et ses fins sur parler avec lger et dirige de ct le contact avec les yeux  ou la femme, que deux semble l'aimer malgr son potentiel tre captur ou tre tu  n'importe quel moment - avant leurs yeux mmes. Pouvoir j'ajoute,  Les Flins  a des excutions passionnes, rapides comme un mouvement de lopard par Delon, et la cinmatographie suprieure.

Ce film rsonne clairement une direction exacte dans le complot quand le caractre de Delon vainc son ravisseur trs tt dans j'Agit, abat une auto en carne de la falaise dans les profondeurs d'ocan en est tir , et nage alors comme un poisson par le courant de fond dans l'a fil le refuge d'un bassin ; il court sur l'escalier et chappe la mort aux mains d'hommes qui cherche le faire le grand mal. Son mouvement, son agilit, son charisme, sa stature comme un acteur physique capable de travail de tour de force passionnant, et les traits de Juan de Don presque incroyables entre les sauts et les sauts - excite le tlspectateur au-del de l'empathie normale ;  moins que je suis mpris. Me pardonner pour l'tre prsomptueux.

Extrmement recommander ce film fantastique. Il a l'intention subtile partout, comme un saphir qui luit brillant dans le clair de lune.  Les Flins  frappe si dans son originalit que l'un doit se pencher en avant pour viter manquer < ses yeux qui elle supplient ou ses yeux qui lui adorent >.

2718035,5,B000M16WFE,"I had this mixed up with ONCE A THIEF, an early Alain Delon film that showed off his beauty. I learned it is not available yet on DVD. Too bad. It played on TCM and I assumed it was on DVD. I had recorded it off the network but erased it thinking I could buy the DVD widescreen version. Wrong and I doubt if it will be showing again. I never watched Joy House all the way through. Well, I finally watched it again and again. It is a very good Alain Delon movie. I bought ONCE A THIEF from someone in New York. A terrible copy that looked like a fourth generation from VHS. JOY HOUSE is very good and available on Amazon.",1311552000,,620,4.008064516129032
2718036,4,B000M16WFE,"Lola Albright, as the worldly, sensuous, widow (how did her husband die?), Jane Fonda, as the innocent, sensuous cousin, who found themsleves in a French chateau, living both in high society and amongst the poor (they do charity work at a Church).
Alain Delon, in a kind of amalgam role of James Dean and Dirk Bogarde, is the bad boy, on the run from a crime family. He finds employment as chaffeur to the ladies.
But will he drive that Rolls-Royce right to the airport, when the time is right?
In the previous decade, perhaps Barbara Stanwyck and Natalie Wood might have taken on the characters of Barbra and Melinda, but I can think of any two actresses who could do better than Albright and Fonda in this offbeat thriller; though I found Fonda's acting just a tad mannered, at times.
The beat is beautifully underscored by a jazz-infused soundtrack by Lalo Schiffrin, who emphasizes [what I hear as] a snaking upright bass line; clean but insistent and recurringly as softly as the house cat who watches and retreats throughout.",1253232000,,1031,4.733333333333333
2718037,5,B000M16WFE,A RARE FILM WITH A LOVELY JANE FONDA WHO IN THIS STORY IS A PAWN WHICH SLOWLY CHANGES POSITION. A THRILLER TYPE MOVIE WITH A TWIST ENDING.,1232409600,,138,4.148148148148148
2718038,5,B000M16WFE,"I remember seeing Joy House (Les Felins) when I was about fifteen and thinking it was a long and boring affair. Well time changes things and with luck a little sophistication comes with age.

Upon revisiting the film I found it a fun French-New Wave-Gothic-Noir romp along the Riviera at the height of the jet set age.  The film is a mystery and my review will leave the plot just that for you (I hate so called reviews that are just a synopsis of a film and nothing else). I will say this much, Joy House is labyrinthine and delicious an well worth a visit down its rabbit hole.

  The cinematography in cinemascope black and white is crisp, sharp and glamorous. It shows off the lovely landscapes of the South of France at the same time, the twisted psyches of the three main characters.

Jane Fonda here in her French ing&eacute;nue period is luscious and interesting. She gives one glimpses of where she is going in the near future as an actress. It is fun to watch her bubble and squeak as the freaky sex kitten Melinda.  Alan Delon steams up the scene and the screen as Marc a hustler who gets more than he bargained for. Delon is just so much fun to watch. One of a few French actors of the 60's who translated to American audiences and made a splash in English language films. (This film was shot in English and can be watched in dubbed French as well). Here he is playing a variation on his role in Purple Noon, but that is not a bad thing since his Ripley was so much fun. Then there is Lola Albright as Barbara, a woman with more than just a little secret upstairs in the attic. Here is an actress who has been forgotten for the most part and I myself cannot recall any of her films. But her performance in this glittering souffl&eacute; is the nutty center of the film that fascinates. She is hard, sexy, dangerous, and yet as it turns out more vulnerable than her seemingly sweet cousin Melinda.

  The whole thing is directed with style and flair by Rene Clement and served up with panache and a wink.",1226966400,,2015,4.363636363636363
2718039,5,B000M16WFE,"What a fun, fast-paced movie. Alain Delon stars as Marc, a man being hunted by the husband of a woman he's had an affair with. When he takes refuge in a shelter, two ""philanthropist"" American beauties, the widow Barbara (Lola Albright) and her younger American cousin Melinda (Jane Fonda), rescue him and appoint him their personal chauffeur.

What follows is an erotic and creepy adventure between these people that strikes with several brilliant twists just when we imagine we've been comfortable too long. Joy House is equal parts chase film, thriller, romance and action, and successful in all. The story has us side with all of the characters at different times throughout the narrative. Everyone is good and everybody is bad in Joy House, and it's riveting to watch. The film is expertly crafted by director Rene Clement, and beautifully photographed by the film's cinematographer, Henri Dacae. What really surprised me is the score, largely jazz influenced and written by Lalo Schifrin. The music seems atypical for a genre film like this, but works wonderfully--as it does in so many of Godard's films from this era.

I had never heard of this movie when I stumbled upon it, but am quite glad I did. I recommend this highly not only for fans of genre films and Alain Delon and Jane Fonda, but anyone interested in entertainment; the appeal is universal.",1220486400,,1361,4.913043478260869
2718040,2,B000M16WFE,This meandering noir brought to my mind a French word...ennui.  The story goes nowhere the acting is pedestrian with the possible exception of a winsome young Jane Fonda.

2718042,1,B000M16WFE,"This release is something of a mess.  The most glaring problem is the total absence of subtitles.  French is the spoken language for about 90% of the film, yet no subtitles in any language are available.  The menu is basically non-existent.  The only buttom is for ""film"". There are no chapter points available, certainly no extras.

All voices appear to be dubbed (badly), even for obviously French-speaking actors, including Delon.

The print is passable, but not much better than what you would see on a VHS copy.

It is difficult for me to comment on the film since my skill in understanding French is limited. It appears to be a noir-ish thriller with few jolts.  Fans of Delon will enjoy seeing him at his athletic best in some exciting chase scenes, but please do wait for a DVD release properly presented.  My copy of ""Les Felins"" arrived yesterday.

2718044,5,B000M16WFE,"Being a fan of Alain Delon, French New Wave films of the 60's and classic film noir was reason alone for watching this incredible movie.  I recently viewed ""Purple Noon"" and fell in love with director Rene Clement's style and his eye for detail.  He handles the most complex situations with such a creative flow that is visually striking.  After reseaching his other films I came across ""Joy House"" with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda.  The DVD is OOP and I had to spend quite of bit of money to be able to buy the film.  I'm happy to say it was money well worth spent.  I loved the movie!  From the moment the credits appear in and out and from behind the scenery I was mesmerized.  What starts out as a typical ""man on the run from the mob"" screenplay soon evolves into an almost gothic, melodramatic thriller with hints of macabre humor.

Alain Delon and Jane Fonda were at their youthful, hip, gorgeous BEST when this film was made.  They both have great chemistry together and give excellent performances.  They seem to be having so much ""fun"" with their characters and with the puzzle-like plot.

The transfer to DVD is very good.  The beautiful black and white images are sharp and Clement's composition shots are breathtaking.  The musical score is memorable and adds great eeriness and excitement to the scenes.  This is a film that thrills you with it's suspense and yet has fun in a ""campy"" way with it's plot and characters.  Watch out for those ""TWO CRAZY WOMEN""!",1120608000,,1472,4.561068702290076

Fans of Purple Noon and 1960s French crime cinema should really enjoy it!
All the actors give terrific involved performances and the energy between a young Jane Fonda (Barbarella era) and Alain Delon is electric!!
Also of note - Lalo Schifrin produced an amazing score for this film that will stick with you long after it's over.
The DVD quality is terrific and the film looks very sharp, which highlights Henri Decae's amazing cinematography. Well worth purchasing if you can't find the DVD for rent!",1058313600,,783,5.030769230769231
2718046,4,B000M16WFE,"""Joy House"", aka ""Les Felins"", is a surprisingly good suspenser, with more than enough twists and turns to keep you intrigued until the clever ending. Unfortunately, the film has been transfered to video with less than loving care. A scratchy, brittle-looking print has been letter-boxed slightly, then squeezed to further accomodate a standard-size TV screen. (They don't tell you that on the video box.) The results are wierdly off-putting and less than inviting. Perhaps the DVD of this title is an improvement over the video release. If not, some smart film preservationist would do well to see that a cleaner, crisper print is available for any future transfer. (In the correct aspect ratio, please!) I have a sneaking suspicion that ""Joy House"" may be an even better film than one would gather from its current video release. It's got an extremely attractive cast, beautiful settings, and top-notch craftsmen working behind the camera. Thankfully, the film never seems to take itself too seriously, moves at a good clip, and has an ending that's tension-packed and appropriately ironic. The only major drawback of the production might be its lack of color photography, otherwise it's almost comparable to Clement and Delon's earlier suspenser, ""Purple Noon""... but not quite. Overall, ""Joy House"" is quite a good film, very entertaining, and, on the whole, worth purchasing, especially if you're a fan of Delon, Fonda, or the lesser-known Albright... just so long as you don't mind a video transfer that leaves a lot to be desired.(Good News!  I've had a chance to compare the DVD with the VHS, and I'm happy to report that the DVD is pretty terrific, sound and picture wise. Everything you'd expect when you plunk your money down for a movie at home. A big, big improvement over the VHS version.  Plus, there are two soundtracks on the disc: English and French.  Only complaints: if you want to watch the film with its French soundtrack, there are no English subtitles to go with it, and, as someone else has noted, there are no DVD extras.  But listen, if you're even halfway interested in seeing ""Joy House"", definitely, definitely watch the DVD edition and not that lousy VHS version.)",1003708800,,2195,4.9890710382513666
