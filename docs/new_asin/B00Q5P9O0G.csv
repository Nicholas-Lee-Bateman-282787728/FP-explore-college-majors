8690508,5,B00Q5P9O0G,"Fantastic project!  Enjoyed the mysterious twists and turns each film took me on.  ""Never Alone""  ""A Boost of Love"" and ""Torn"" were my favorites.  Great to see prominent, established Hollywood actors and actresses in these well-produced and well-written indie films.  Thanks for the thought-provoking entertainment.",1423699200,,315,5.911111111111111
