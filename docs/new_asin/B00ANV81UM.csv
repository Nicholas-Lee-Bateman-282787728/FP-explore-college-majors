5461800,5,B00ANV81UM,Theresa Caputo and her family are a very fun family to follow. It is very powerful to watch Thersa talk to people about family members who are on the other side and send messages through her. I am not able to watch this show when it airs so downloading it to my Kindle Fire is a great way to watch. I can watch it on my time for a small price. I love this show and hope more seasons are to come.,1337040000,,395,3.8292682926829267

5461806,2,B00ANV81UM,"I saw her live after I watched this. She def puts on a good show, and does have guts and is funny. Would I order any more of her stuff? NO WAY. After seeing her live, I don't really like what she does and we paid WAY TOO MUCH for her tickets. NO I think she is a fraud and she prays on people's emotions..but hey, if she makes others feel better about the dead, Who am I to judge.",1463011200,,380,3.7625

5461871,5,B00ANV81UM,"Hands down this is my favorite show on television. The readings are done the way they are supposed to be- helping people heal and reassuring them that their loved ones are still around and ok!! Theresa is the best there is and I am amazed at her ability to connect with those on the other side. When I watch this, I feel good after watching this and think about what really matters most in life including thinking about how our actions affect others and being more mindful to be better a better person, laugh more, live more,  and especially the importance of family.
Also, Theresa's family makes this so real and a bit humorous as well. Her children remind me of mine. Wonderful show!",1418169600,,685,4.524193548387097

I bought the entire season for my mom who adores her and who was unable to catch every episode at the time.  She is enjoying it enormously, and even I never seem to tire of watching it again.....

5461887,1,B00ANV81UM,"Hmm, Spirit should have told her she'd get a 1 star from me (hold on, do I have to be deceased to rate her?). The only reason she received a star at all is the entertainment I receive from hearing her repeat ""I'm a Medium"" as she proceeds to invade an unsuspecting sap's personal world. Oh, and also the fact that my wife likes the show.",1411689600,,337,4.121212121212121

5461894,5,B00ANV81UM,Totally Awesome ... Theresa Caputo is a wonderful woman !,1404518400,,57,4.8
5461905,5,B00ANV81UM,I THINK THIS REALITY SHOW DESERVES A FIVE STAR BECAUSE I BELIEVE SHE IS WHAT SHE IS... AND SHE KEEPS IT REAL AND BRINGS GOOD TO THOSE WHO HAVE KEPT THEIR HEART IN SADNESS DUE TO SOMEONE THEY LOVED WHO PASSED AWAY....AND TO SEE HOW THEY REACT TO HER AND WHAT SHE SHARES WITH THEM IS PRICELESS...,1403222400,,294,4.175438596491228
5461906,4,B00ANV81UM,"Some believe in contacting the departed; others do not.  Theresa Caputo announces (over and over) that she not only believes in it, but does it regularly.  She explains just a little bit (in season one) about how she receives her ""messages""--in her mind's eye she sees people come forward, usually one at a time.  Often they gesture in a code that makes sense to her at least, certain things conveying certain concepts.  Other times, she gets words which she repeats.

Skeptics have pointed out performances (live ones in particular) in which there may have been ""plants"" in the audience.  As far as filmed shows go, if a ""reading"" does not go well, it probably isn't aired, right?

What makes the show somewhat amusing are the reactions of her two kids (one girl and one boy, both around high school age at least in season one) who treat her communion with spirits with some mixture of apparent credulity and irritation.  They seem pretty much like normal teenagers.  Her husband, a heavily tattooed guy, apparently has some kind of disability and so doesn't work outside the home, and tends to be fairly quiet although when he does talk, is supportive of Theresa.

In other ways she appears not at all like a ""medium""-she enjoys having her nails done, her hair styled, coordinated clothes, etc.  she struggles as do some other adults, with transitioning from older to newer technology as when she makes audio recordings of sessions.

I've watched enough ""ghost stories"" and a few about mediums, s&eacute;ances and the like.  This one was a somewhat refreshing hybrid of that and some kind of ""reality TV"" about a New Jersey family and their interactions.  I haven't gone beyond looking at one season.",1398816000,2,1702,4.844290657439446
5461907,5,B00ANV81UM,"I love this show and I love this dvd, wish they had more seasons on dvd. I want more seasons on dvd.",1395878400,,100,3.590909090909091
5461908,5,B00ANV81UM,"There are only good things to say about this DVD! If you like Theresa Caputo & the show, this is a must have for your collection! My ONLY complaint is there aren't any other of the seasons out on DVD! I'd love to have ALL the seasons as would many other people!!!! Come on TLC, put some more out! PLEASE!",1395360000,,304,4.083333333333333
5461909,5,B00ANV81UM,"Theresa Caputo is a typical long island mom with a great sense of humor and she also possesses a special and unique gift; she can communicate with the dead. Skeptics and true believers will enjoy this show and feel touched as Theresa helps people communicate with their loved ones and deliver messages to them. The show not only focuses on Theresa's day job, but also on her family. You will see everyday life for her as she goes out with her friends to dinner parties, cruises, and even to the grocery store. It will make you laugh, cry, and really just take you on an emotional roller coaster. This show is unlike any other show on TLC or any other network. It is not like other medium shows. If you love mediums or are interested in learning more about what they do, long island medium is the show for you. I love it, and I hope that TLC will eventually decide to release the other seasons on DVD as well(they can also be purchased on amazon's instant video).

5461943,5,B00ANV81UM,"Theresa Caputo is a medium that talks to peoples dead relatives for a living. She helps people let go of their grief over their relatives passings. The real charm of the show is the Caputo family, Theresa is the hysterically funny Mom, Larry is the gruff loveable Dad, Larry is the insightful, athletic son and Victoria is the sweet yet serious daughter. It is clear they have a lot of fun together and love each other very much!

Even if you don't believe in mediums there are so many lessons in this show. I've lost people and its really helped me. Its hard to let go of intense emotions but it feels like that is our life lesson. You'll watch episodes and it'll feel like you're working through your own emotions like a therapy session!

Her kids don't appreciate the money their mom is making to keep them in a really nice home and benefits. Give it up kids. I lot of teenagers would like to have what this family has. Please leave them out.  I wonder how made up this is since tv cameras are in the shops, on the street, and with the families following her at all times?.  How does she know when she walks into a butcher shop that she is going to have an interaction beforehand and brings the tv camera in with her?  Hmmm.  I am going to find a medium in my area though and see what she picks up.",1383350400,,656,4.023076923076923

Then we all watched it together.  They all said the same thing, they loved the show and they loved her.  I stayed up to watch another episode, even though I was very tired.

5461984,5,B00ANV81UM,"I love this show. She's funny, and real. and so compassionate. You can't help but see that she's not putting on an act or reading people. She's the real thing. I watch season one, and two on my Kindle Fire and record her on my DVR at home. That way I can see her when I'm at home or away from home. She's the real deal. I cry right along with her clients. Very moving and at times funny. What a character!!",1355961600,3,406,3.9634146341463414

8554963,2,B00ANV81UM,"Very sorry to any fan, but i just could not stand her voice ..  lol.. im sorry!!!
I really wanted to watch this as i wanted to know about how she began her career as a medium.
I had to turn it off after 20 mins of the first episode, as it just seemed to be off topic to me, i understand people want to get a feel of her life and personality, i guess i was just wanting her to get straight to the point lol..
But her voice was loud and obnoxious,  i couldn't handle it, but thats only my opinion.
I do know,  i admire what she does and how many people she has helped in her life,  so maybe reading one of her books would better suite me, ",1507680000,,637,3.7954545454545454
