4042951,5,B00308B16G,"I own the first 2 seasons. A few years ago, Showtime was set to air all 4 seasons but pulled the plug after only 3 episodes. I can't understand why no network will run this. It's the best animated series ever. I truly hope that seasons 3 & 4 will be available on DVD at some point.
I WANT MY BOB & MARGARET!

Update: I originally owned the first season on VHS but one of my tapes snapped off in the VCR while we were watching on Thanksgiving. So thrilled to finally have the first 2 seasons out on DVD. Hoping to see 3 and 4 in the VERY near future.",1296950400,2,549,3.945945945945946
4042952,4,B00308B16G,My friend and I used to watch this show all the time several years back... I was so excited when I saw that it was available on DVD because we loved it! I only wish there were more episodes in season 1 :-),1279411200,6,205,3.7906976744186047
4042953,3,B00308B16G,"I don't think this is the complete first season like is advertised.  I think the show had 13 episodes the first season, but this DVD only had 8 episodes...",1277337600,,155,4.344827586206897
4042954,4,B00308B16G,"First of all I must say that I was so excited when I saw this DVD was available to purchase here on Amazon. I've been looking for this series since I watched on the channel Locomotion here in Mexico City and I absolutely fall in love with this cartoon. Here in Mexico, this program was broadcasted in Spanish and in English (with SAP option), so, when I checked the product details and I saw ""Spanish"" as a language of audio, I assumed it was the original language that Locomotion broadcasted... but... NO. Amazon should specify in this kind of items what kind of language are availables, becuase the Spanish language IS NOT THE ORIGINAL audio that Locomotion broadcast this series. Bob & Margaret in Locomotion were transmitted in Spanish language (from Spain), and this DVD is featured with audio in Spanish (but from Argentina), and this is extremly sad. For all of us who watched this and know how to understand this british humor, it was 100% better to use the Spanish (from Spain) than other one, even the acclaimed Mexican dubbing WILL NOT work on this kind of series.

So, please take this as a warning before purchase this item. The product is amazing, the DVD covers are good and the video and sound quality are great, even this Spanish (from Argentina) is ok, but if you think puchasing this item will bring old Locomotion memories, you're wrong and you will be disappointed in that aspect.

All the others aspects, deserve the best. That's why I put 4 stars instead 5, because all the Latin American who enjoyed this cartoon in Locomotion will be disappointed when the discover the audio ""Spanish"" is not the spanish we were expected.

Sorry if my english is not perfect, but I'm from Mexico.

Thanks.",1272240000,6,1713,4.681063122923588
4042955,4,B00308B16G,"I've been waiting for Bob & Margaret to come out on DVD forever. Now that Season 1 is available, I guess we will just have to wait a few more years for the other seasons.  What a shame? Love this show!!",1268092800,7,202,3.926829268292683
4042956,5,B00308B16G,"All I can say is... it's about time!  This is a highly underrated, yet thoroughly enjoyable show.  Better than most of its genre.  Bob & Margaret is a one of a kind show which I followed avidly on Comedy Central almost a decade ago.  Sadly it's become most obscure since then.  A brief run on showtime, but otherwise, this show hasn't been in circulation in the states for years & years, alas.

It'll be exciting to see this from the very beginning.  I bought the DVD set of complete season 2 episodes which is currently out in Canada, but to have season set 1 as a companion piece would be excellent.  I'm also looking forward to & hoping to see seasons 3 & 4, & hopefully not too long between releases.",1260316800,12,704,4.320610687022901

I also purchased Season 2 but have not yet watched it...but I do know it is just as good as the first season!!",1410739200,,299,4.228070175438597
8385512,5,B00308B16G,"This 2-DVD set contains all 13 episodes of Bob & Margaret, a British cartoon from 1998-2000, created by Alison Snowden and David Fine.  It's absolutely hilarious!  Each episode runs about 23 minutes.

For the unfamiliar, this is a cartoon, not necessarily for adults, but indeed for grown-ups.  It's all about those everyday professional and personal situations many of us find ourselves in.  Bob Fish, a dentist, and his wife, Margaret, a chriopodist, are a childless middle-aged couple who live in a suburb of London with their dogs, William and Elizabeth.  Socially, it's in the same vein as, say, ""Doc Martin"" and ""Keeping Up Appearances"".  With respect to price, it's a great bargain!",1399593600,,689,5.098214285714286
8385513,5,B00308B16G,"I really love this show. It's great subtle humor and good for the whole family. The style of the cartoons is adorable (better than just seeing a still - you have to see them moving to really appreciate) and the writing is top notch.

Bob & Margaret and Dr. Katz used to be my favorite shows on Comedy Central. So glad to see it's on DVD! If you like Dr. Katz or if you like the British version of The Office, you might consider giving Bob & Margaret a try. It's a similar kind of comedy.",1386028800,,487,4.072916666666667
8385514,5,B00308B16G,This was wonderful! Love the adult humor of a couple who considers their pets to be their children! I can relate! Need Season 2!,1384387200,,128,4.375
8385515,5,B00308B16G,"You have to love Bob & Margaret!  They are funny, you can relate to them, and their accents are understandable and not off putting.  I've always loved these characters and plan to collect the entire set.",1329955200,,203,4.611111111111111
