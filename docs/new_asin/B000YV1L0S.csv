3035927,4,B000YV1L0S,"This DVD is a re-release of a product that originally came out on VHS titled ""Yoga Remedies for Natural Healing.""  Because the practice features five short yoga routines (each about 8.5 minutes), the DVD format is a vast improvement, as you can easily go directly to the routine of your choice from the main menu.  The practices are led by yoga instructor Rodney Yee, who teaches via voiceover.  In addition to the five main routines, there is also a 4-minute ""Conscious Breathing"" exercise; here Yee leads the viewer through breath awareness while in a reclined position.  I have described each of the five main practices in detail below.

Stress.  This practice is a bit shorter than the others (7.5 minutes), and it is designed to release tension from the head, neck, and shoulders; Yee demonstrates along with fellow yoga instructor Suzanne Deason.  It begins with several arm stretches, including stretching the arms overhead and into eagle arms.  There is also a single sun salutation and several standing poses (triangle, side angle, wide-legged standing forward bend).  The practice finishes with some additional arm stretches an a brief savasana.

Indigestion.  Here Deason demostrates alone, beginning in a reclined position for a series of reclined twists.  Several variations on seated (sage) twists follow, and the routine concludes with child's and hero's poses.

Back Pain.  This practice uses two blankets and a strap; Yee is practicing alone.  The props are used to facilitate several supported reclined postures.  There is a brief cat/cow stretch followed by down dog, and then cobra pose is practiced with the blanket under the hips.  The routine finishes in child's pose.

Fatigue.  This practice uses a chair and two blankets, and I believe the demonstrator is Yee's ex-wife, Donna Fone.  The first posture is standing forward bend with the head supported on the chair, and then down dog is performed with the head supported on the block.  Next, the chair is again used to support the head in a seated forward bend.  The final pose was a sort of modified plow, resting the knees and the tops of the feet on the chair; this posture was a bit difficult to set up, especially given that not much time is allowed here.  The practice finishes with a brief rest with calves on the chair.

Headache.  This session, which Yee leads alone, was a bit longer at 9.5 minutes.  It consists mainly of supported, restorative postures.  Yee uses two blankets and an eye bag for both legs-up-the-wall pose and a reclined lying chest opener with the feet at the wall.  This routine also includes practice of alternate nostril breathing and brief meditation.

Overall, this DVD offers a nice selection of short yoga practices.  I would recommend the DVD mainly to those with some prior yoga experience, as the practices move a bit quickly at times.  My favorite routine was the Stress, which required no props and which did not suffer from the lack of longer pose holds.",1220054400,112,2972,4.943434343434343

It is important to start slow, and if the pose is to difficult......work on what you can accomplish. Yoga is not a competitive sport.....it is the ability to listening to your body's voice. Our body wants to be well, we must listen to that inner voice and develop a healthy Yoga practice. The DVD is in sections depending on what may be troubling you.

If you have been told to lower your stress and not overexert yourself, this might be for you. I began this while recovering from an injury but now it is a part of my daily life. Segments are approx 8 mins long so when the alarm goes off I tell myself ""It's just 8 minuets, just get up!"" I always start with the one for headaches since in that segment you are laying on the floor anyway. :)Once I'm up I always wind up doing most, if not all the 5 or 6 segments, and I ALWAYS feel 99% better,clear and energized when I'm done.
4 stars because the quality of the picture is pixellated and makes me wonder if it was a copy of a copy. My sister has the same DVD and it has really gorgeous scenery.",1374105600,20,790,4.006329113924051
3270474,5,B000YV1L0S,This was great because he segments the sessions so you can do a quick session or do a few. He gives ways to modify techniques to fit any level. Great for your health and easy to add to your life style.,1369785600,,201,3.926829268292683
3270475,1,B000YV1L0S,I would not recommend this dvd at all. I would have given no stars if it were possible. It freezes the whole time. And it appears that I am just out the money as they will not do full returns or pay for shipping to exchange it. So I will just throw it away and never order another.,1368403200,,281,3.8620689655172415
