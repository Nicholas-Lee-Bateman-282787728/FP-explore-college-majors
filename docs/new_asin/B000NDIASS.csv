PRODUCT DETAIL:
Prophecies of Israel DVD
Archival footage and dramatic reenactments illustrate this astounding story.
Renowned experts in the Jewish holy texts provide insightful analysis.
The rise of modern Israel was foretold thousands of years ago.
Common wisdom has it we prepare for our future by understanding our past. But did the ancient prophets already know the future? Are we living in the world they predicted? In this enlightening and often unsettling series, THE HISTORY CHANNEL revisits the prophecies and divinations of the Ancients and traces them to the modern events they may have been predicting.

The Tanakh, the ancient Hebrew Bible, contains passages that seem to predict with stunning accuracy the birth, history and fate of the modern Israeli state. Many of the prophecies have come true; many remain to be carried out. Were the ancient prophets divinely guided to these uncanny forecasts? By studying them can we anticipate the future of one of the most pivotal regions in the world?

THE HISTORY CHANNEL continues its tradition of balanced, exhaustive and entertaining insight in this fascinating exploration of the Tankh, known when it was written as the Mikra, and the events it predicted. Scholars from the three major religions, illuminating dramatizations and close analysis provide a deep understanding of these remarkable prophecies.

The future of the Middle East and the planet may already be written in the PROPHECIES OF ISRAEL.",1223942400,4,1755,5.0
