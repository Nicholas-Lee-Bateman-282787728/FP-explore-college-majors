7316343,5,B010RZT9RM,"This is an excellent resource to get you up and running very quickly - the video helps you to ""see"" step by step, and James puts this on a level to make it easy to follow and not quite as intimidating as the manual (but definitely read the manual!!!  Use this as an additional resource).  Money well-spent!",1454112000,,306,4.350877192982456

7316345,5,B010RZT9RM,"This is a ""must have"" for any new Phantom 3 Pro flyer.  I learned more from this DVD than I did in all my research.  Very well done.  After receiving my new P3P, I quickly found out that I was in way over my head.  DJI documentation is vague and assumes you already know a lot about their product.  This DVD answered all my questions in an easy to understand way.",1440720000,4,363,4.056338028169014

8723085,5,B010RZT9RM,"Excellent format to deliver a huge amount of information.  Most of this information is online but, not in a well organized and easy to understand fashion as this is.  For someone new to the hobby, YOU NEED THIS NOW! For an experienced pilot as myself I learned a lot and am a better pilot for it.",1460678400,,296,4.267857142857143
8723086,5,B010RZT9RM,"I purchased Jim's training online, it's great, it's specific and Jim is a very good teacher (communicates well) which makes it very easy to learn to fly these birds!  The video tutorials are specific for every area you need (the RC, the Drone, the battery, firmware updates, safety, etc.).  I would highly recommend the training from Jim, and for sure before you ever get your drone off the ground!",1460332800,2,398,4.753623188405797

8723089,5,B010RZT9RM,This is one of the best.  If you want to learn to fly safely with your drone this will help you do it.  The video will also give you a chance to go to the authors website and get the latest reviews and other info.  This author is the best,1457136000,,238,3.72
8723090,5,B010RZT9RM,I discovered Phantom Knowledge while researching the Phantom 3 on YouTube.  After seeing the informative style of this companies YouTube productions... I purchased this training video.  It was extremely enlightening and so helpful.  I actually purchased this video prior to buying a Phantom 3 and I would recommend learning as much as you can prior to your purchase.  This is too expensive of an investment for a hobby where you could destroy your bird with your first flight.  I recommend buying this video prior to your Phantom 3 purchase and then watching it again after purchase.  There is so much good information in this training video it will save you from losing your investment.  As well as eliminating a lot of stress prior to your first flight.  Well Done!!!,1457049600,2,769,4.906976744186046
