7666371,4,B01BRFSGJ8,"High production values, tons of fast-pacing, some quite decent acting, profound writing, but completely silly-almost-everything-else.  What you have here is a film you'll dust off and watch more than enough to justify initial cost.  Far better films don't get a 2nd viewing by me, but this one charms.  CGI was fair.  Lots of small stuff a 2nd viewing will reveal.",1462233600,,364,5.016666666666667
7666372,3,B01BRFSGJ8,"Mojin: The Lost Legend,"" the second film adapted from Tianxia Bachangs best-selling series of novels, is based on the premise that over a thousand years ago, the emperor of China invented the Mojin Xiaowei (grave robbers) to steal gold from the dead for the living. Food supplies were at an all-time scarcity and China had divided itself into three kingdoms that were constantly at war with one another. The emperor relied on the Mojin Xiaowei to assist in those difficult times.

This film picks up in 1988 and traces the adventures of three tomb raiders  Hu Bai (Chen Kun), Wang Kaixuan (Huang Bo), and Shirley Yang (Shu Qi) now retired and living in New York. They resume their former pursuit when cult-leader/millionairess Madam Ying (Liu Xiaoquing) hires them to discover the final resting place of an ancient princess in Inner Mongolia. Their mission: to locate the Equinox Flower, an ages-old treasure with mysterious powers.

Directed by Wuershan, Mojin: The Lost Legend is a fast-paced action/adventure/fantasy flick with that Equinox Flower serving as its central mystery. What is its power and why is Madam Ying so eager to get it? Flashbacks piece together the mystery as the three modern grave robbers pursue their quest.

Special effects don't come up to the quality of Hollywood effects. Much of the action, performed against green screen with CGI enhancement, is not terribly convincing, but the sheer energy of the performers and the element of fantasy drive the picture, making for an entertaining if not overly memorable experience.

The film is in Mandarin, with available English and Chinese subtitles. Bonus features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette with a behind-the-scenes look at production, and the theatrical trailer.",1462233600,,1784,5.223776223776224

7666379,3,B01BRFSGJ8,"One reviewer claimed that this film was superior to the more recent release TIME RAIDERS (not TOMB RAIDERS, even though that is what they are). I believe that this film is similar but not superior to TIME RAIDERS. I don't, for example, remember any anti-American sentiments or pro-Communism comments in the other. This film quotes the Chairman perhaps a little too often and uses ""comrade"" throughout. I know that this was a Chinese film and should have Chinese sensibilities, but I wonder if these references were included to please the government watchdogs. The censors must have had orgasms of delight when the clown character referred to the US as ""sick America."" Yet just who was desecrating tombs?

The main trio is appealing enough, but the clown character could have been bumped off early to spare us his annoying presence. Reference is often made to a young lady, Ding, who is killed during an earlier tomb raid, and she is referred to as a sacrificial character. Replacing her is a lovely heroine who admits in front of others that she ""f*****"" the protagonist. This is in translation, of course, but I was still impressed by her boldness. The set designs and special effects are well-done for what must have been an expensive film to produce.",1473465600,,1253,4.855140186915888

7666384,3,B01BRFSGJ8,"Features some pretty good special effects (for the most part), and an interesting premise, but doesn't quite deliver. Likely due to having to pretend that the things taking place are ""illusions"". Not the studio's fault, they have no choice. Would have liked more puzzles/traps and action like at the beginning.",1471305600,,310,5.22
7666385,3,B01BRFSGJ8,"It was an ok movie with decent elements of humor, action, etc, but have low expectations going into it. The trailer portrayed a movie with some pretty badass action sequences and while it did have a couple, they were few in number. The overall film made me want bash the comic relief's head in.",1470700800,,294,4.462962962962963

7666390,5,B01BRFSGJ8,"This movie was a surprise treat. The three main leads have great chemistry together and the story is very good containing both serious and heartfelt moments alongside tons of lighthearted fun. This movie seemed like a perfect storm of summer entertainment. The plot seems like the best elements of Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted while still being it's own movie in the process. I really enjoyed the larger than life set pieces, the great cast and just how enjoyable and watchable the movie is on a whole. It may not be for everyone but it was definitely for me. It had hints of nostalgia mixed with high fantasy. Recommended!",1468108800,,636,4.790909090909091

8751159,5,B01BRFSGJ8,"Lots of action and the beautiful Shu Qi to look at? Sounds like Heaven to me! Great film, but note it's Chinese tempo's and cultural standards here. So everything is toned down a notch, no cleavage, etc. High production value, solid script, great acting, it's a fun read. I watched this one first, but it's sort of a sequel to ""Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe"" which I highly recommend!",1537401600,,386,4.608695652173913
8751160,3,B01BRFSGJ8,"A high three stars or a low four stars whichever way you want to look at it there is a good movie here just dying to get out and entertain you. For those who won't be needing subtitles this is probably a four star escapist nonsensical action flick with good solid special effects, faced paced action and some slapstick thrown in to ruin a few obligatory scenes.

For those who will be relying on the subtitles to understand what is going on well you are going to face a bit of an uphill battle early on as they aren't that great at imparting real meaning. Once the movie moves passed the initial set up phase and into the brainless action you'll be on firmer ground. In summation what we have here is a bunch of Chinese tomb raiders who go around, well, pinching stuff from dead people. It's all pretty stock standard though it is heavily influenced early on with a rather strange cultural revolution backdrop where the group of young people from whom the main characters are drawn seem to want to smash everything they come across. Whatever, it serves little purpose apart from facilitating the raising of the spectre of Japan for no real narrative reason. But hey, ya gotta get permission to get your film out somehow...

As noted by several reviewers the special effects are pleasing and the fight scenes are entertaining. There is the usual overacting and the weakling style characters endless non-comedic whining makes you wish someone would just put a bullet in him and shut him up permanently. It really is grating stuff.

As said, if you can watch this without subtitles you'll be less likely to be taken out of the moment and out of the movie and will get more out of it. It is a nicely rendered and attractive looking film with a pleasing enough resolution.",1525132800,,1767,4.5854430379746836

8751162,5,B01BRFSGJ8,Probably difficult to follow for someone not interested in the Chinese mysticism and comic martial arts tomb raiders mashup.
