8227271,5,B000X8XWGI,"This is the  best print I have seen of The Bees. OK it is cheesy and over the top, but that is the point. It also carries a message which ironically is relevant today. John Carradine has a major part and hams it up magnificently. His arthritic hands are painfully obvious in many shots, but he carried on like the trooper he was. John Saxon is the epitome of the heroic leading man and has some terrific dialogue and a good fight scene as well.
Angel Tompkins is in fine form and works well with both Johns.
The featurette with Director Alfredo Zacharias is very informative and makes a nice companion piece.
Highly recommended if you are a fan of John Saxon, John Carradine and Angel Tompkins.",1462838400,,694,4.464566929133858
8227272,2,B000X8XWGI,"Why did I spend money on this cheesy movie.. I know, for John Saxon. Sadly he couldn't even save this money. The Blu-ray is fine.",1456185600,,129,4.2
8227273,5,B000X8XWGI,"THE BEES opens w/ a huge hive of honeybees, busily buzzing away. Then, the grim narrator intones our doom, telling of the plague of killer bees! Next, we are shown the lethal nature of these insidious insects, as they swarm and sting, Sting, STING some unwary victims in Mexico! We are introduced to Dr. Miller (Claudio Brook), a man w/ lots of these ""devil bees"" at his genetic research facility. He also sports a thick, obviously bee-proof, helmet of hair that even Marjoe Gortner would envy! Disaster strikes when angry villagers attack, sending the Dr. and his wife, Sandra (Angel Tompkins- THE TEACHER) into a swatting / screaming frenzy! Enter John Norman (John Saxon- BLACK CHRISTMAS, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), who joins forces w/ the recently-widowed Mrs. Miller, in order to smuggle the bees from Mexico into the USA. The fun ensues when various people, including a pair of muggers,  can't keep from unleashing the killer bees from Sandra's cosmetic case! Meanwhile, greedy businessmen are interested in the bees' honey-making abilities, in spite of their deadly reputation. Of course, this leads to catastrophic nonsense, as the swarm turns into a veritable cloud of death, stinging useless extras, in a wanton orgy of venom-drenched slaughter! THE BEES is another ludicrous entry in the ""killer bees"" sub-genre. While the set-up is absurd, the result is hilarious over-acting, flailing, and rolling around to beat the band! The mega-death-by-bees is highly entertaining, while reducing our brains to royal jelly! My favorite scene involves a bee parade (!) and the hopping, jumping, swatting crowd under assault! This movie is jam-packed w/ such sequences, combined w/ acting and dialogue that are terrible enough to cause a mass cerebral hemorrhage!  Extra joy-points for the idiot soundtrack, featuring some bizarre variation on ""Flight Of The Bumblebee"", mixed w/ spurts of ABBA-esque disco music! Co-stars John Carradine as the same grumpy old so-and-so he plays in all of his films. This time, he adds a strange, impossible-to-discern ""foreign"" accent. His death scene is a riot! This movie's a laugh a second!...",1455494400,5,2131,5.209912536443149

8227275,2,B000X8XWGI,"""The Bees"" is a typical 1970's creatures-gone-amok film with appallingly bad special effects, a lot of scenery chewing from the actors (particularly John Carradine, surprise, surprise...,) and a truly outlandish plot that starts with a honey theft in Mexico and ends with John Saxon brokering a peace agreement between the bees and the UN. Seriously.

John Norman (Saxon) is a noted bee scientist, and he and recently widowed fellow entomologist Sandra Miller (Angel Tompkins) try to save the world from the mutant bees that were bred for their royal jelly by nasty capitalists trying to make a profit in the cosmetics world. Fortunately Dr. Sigmund Hummel (Carradine, with his worst-in-class German accent) shows up to assist, which is good as he has watched so much bee closed-circuit TV that he has learned to speak with the bees thanks to the bee robot he has built.

As the killer bees race across the globe (mostly looking like a cloud of smoke, but sometimes even more ridiculous) they pause to attack various locales, and we see them rampaging in parks, cities, and even attacking Gerald Ford in the Rose Bowl Parade! Technically we see Gerald Ford in the parade then the parade gets attacked, so the President was thankfully spared some of the indignity of inadvertently appearing in this film. Saxon and Carradine realize the answer is to use pheromones to kill the bees (in a very un-politically correct subplot, as it turns out,) and the US Air Force cranks up their C-130s and begins spraying the world, which works for a while (the film actually uses stock footage, apparently of Agent Orange spraying.)

Carradine and Tompkins are not only crack entomologists, they are also apparently CPAs, as they audit an Agriculture Department Undersecretary, who was skimming from the bee research budget. The embezzler quickly puts out a contract on the three scientists, but when the thugs enter the lab to kill Carradine, they also shoot out the glass holding the even more virulent and hyperintelligent bees which leads to predictable results. Oddly, when Saxon and Tompkins return to the lab to have a heart-rending goodbye with Uncle Siggy the bees are all gone. Where did they all go? How do these two never get stung even when they are making out amongst the bees? On his death chair Carradine reveals that the bees are now as smart as humans and know everything that's going on, which is to say, more than any of the cast or audience at this point. I did particularly enjoy the scene where the corrupt Agriculture Undersecretary enters his office where all appears normal. That turns out to be incorrect, though, as the massively brainy bees are merely waiting for him in silence behind his curtains, after which they ambush him and fling him out his office window.

Since the newer bees are now resistant to the pheromone trick, and are now all over Washington, DC, the USAF does the logical thing and launches every tactical aircraft they own to bomb DC. Of course what we really see is stock footage of a large variety of USAF fighters from the 1960s and 1970s attacking bombing ranges and lush green patches of Southeast Asia with no city in sight. It was at this point I elected to give the film an extra star: the eight seconds of the F-105 bombing run is of good quality and shot from a nice angle; otherwise this would be an obvious candidate for a single star rating. The bees quickly rebuff the USAF causing planes and helicopters to crash through the appropriation of more stock footage including the very famous F-100 high angle of attack landing accident. Saxon and Tompkins learn bee language and find out the concerns from the insect world, and relay it to the UN in a scene that has to be seen to be believed. In a turn of events that was just ahead of its time, the bees are concerned with damage man is causing to the environment and want to partner as equals with humans in the future to make the world greener. If they don't get what they want they will kill all humans. Saxon presents their ultimatum to the UN as the bees invade the building in a sublime bit of hysterical over-the-top preachiness that would be at home in the mainstream press today.

""The Bees"" is a run of the mill example of nature-gone-wild filmmaking that was so popular at the time, but it's plodding, full of stock footage, has some truly terrible acting from some people who really should know better, and despite the therapeutic value of laughter it sometimes provides, is a chore to struggle through.",1285632000,10,4512,4.742675159235668
