1404934,4,B000059H8N,"I will begin by saying that if you are reading this, you probably are a phan. Phish music is unmistakable, undeniably fantastic; their ability to execute both technically astounding and fun music is well reknowned enough to continue with little mention of it.
  The disc is full of music, all good. One of the best scenes features the band developing the song ""Birds Of A Feather"" into what ended up on the recording ""The Story of the Ghost"". There isn't alot of focus on the process, though, since it's mostly live performances in Europe and the East coast of the U.S. My interest is in the personalities, and there are some tantalizing scenes featuring backstage antics.
  One of the most fascinating things about the band is that they almost transform when they go on stage. Their off-stage demeanor is somehow completely different and during downtime Trey doesn't resemble the man on stage with the guitar- at all. When being interviewed, The group's frontman is depicted as a defensive 17 year old explaining why he's so minunderstood. Between musical feats of magic and rehersals, He's shown setting up pranks (which seem as improvised as anything the band does) and executing them with childlike glee.  A scene in Spain in which Trey buys a bullwhip and proceeds to crack it after a  few steps out the door is supremely telling. ...Or is it?
  Honestly, there is no way to tell anything concrete from the band as the interview/candid segments are few and far between, and approximately half of all screen time is given to Mr. Anastasio. I think the director lack of familiarity with the band ultimately creates the feel of The Stillwater T-shirt from Almost Famous; one guy is in focus and the rest are blurry and faded. The disc is surely lacking footage of the man Page McConnell calls ""the funniest guy in the band""- Mike Gordon.
  As an addendum, I must say that the deleted scenes are some of the best- the two that focus more on Gordon are both interesting and hilarious. God knows why they were deleted.",984009600,4,2017,4.7371428571428575
1404935,4,B000059H8N,"If you are thinking about getting this DVD you have probably seen them live and know about the band.  If you fall into this bucket, a review will have absolutely no impact on whether you buy it or not - so I'm going to try to stay away from bitching about Trey having too much screen time and question the song choices or why the director decided to present the movie way outside of it's chronological order..
What I will discuss is the exceptional job that Todd Phillips did and how it appears as if he can and will be an important director in the future.  He is able to take a somewhat easy subject and extract something more than can be done by listening to 100's of hours of their shows.  He showcases a personal side of the band without deification, pulls off loads of canned ""rocumentary"" tricks with originality and uniqueness and achieves something on the level of Dylan's Don't Look Back - a rough cut personalized snapshot of a subject beyond what we personally know.  There are always questions about what was left out and I would have liked more ""additional materials"" b/c by being a trader I want just about everything from the floor - but Phillips really pulls off a great achievement and documents an interesting band during an equally interesting period.",983923200,,1270,4.581497797356828
1404936,5,B000059H8N,"As a true phish fan  bittersweet gets 5 stars from me because it has to be one of the best movies to come out in 2001 Awesome shots of the band relaxing, writing songs, getting ready and playing the Great Went. The bonus concert footage at the end of the video is some of the best live footage ever.  definitaly get this video if your a phish fan and even if your not you will still think its great!",983836800,,399,4.037974683544304
1404937,5,B000059H8N,"I saw this movie in the theatres and am glad to say that the Dolby 5.1 mix and the video transfer really do it justice.
For any phan, buying this DVD is a no brainer.  The film itself is excellent, and the extra scenes (including four complete songs from Rochester '97) are great.
My only gripe is that the extra tracks are only in plain 'ol 2.0 stereo, no surround sound.  So, while you get a great version of ""Punch You in the Eye"" and Page singing ""Lawn Boy,""  the sound is a disappointment after watching the film.
A must-have.",983664000,5,531,4.29
1404938,4,B000059H8N,"Here's why the video's worth it.  You've never heard Phish sound like this.  In the concert footage, Page is maybe twice as loud as in concert (at least in the last couple of years).  It's wonderful to actually hear him.",983491200,,220,4.45
1404939,4,B000059H8N,"This movie is really cool...there are a couple of things that I wish were different, but I still enjoyed it...first of all there is a whole lot of trey...don't get me wrong...I love trey, but there is very little of mike and page(practically none)...jon is there, but only when he's with trey...the concert footage rocks!!...and there are some really funny scenes!!...like I said...overall...I really enjoyed it...",982713600,,414,5.287878787878788

Great jams - the DWD jam is the best on the origional release as well as the Punch you which was added to the dvd.  Great footage of great went which captures that phat festival...featuring bands sentiments after good and bad sets.  All around great movie.  A++",980726400,2,408,4.597222222222222

1404984,4,B000059H8N,"This movie captures Phish at their prime in the late 1990's. They were compared to the Grateful Dead in some ways but they had a sound of their own. The ""jam band"" sound they had was priceless. They really knew how to get the audience involved because they loved the band so much. A great film.",1295913600,,294,4.267857142857143
1404985,3,B000059H8N,"1) Rockstars are not always that interesting. I have friends with more interesting personalities and viewpoints.

2) Not enough good music. I've seen them play some damn good stuff. Sheech they followed them around long enough. Obviously the filmakers don't know when a band is ""on"" because they didn't put much of that in.

As per usual in music movies, we'd like to see the BAND play. For some damn reason camera people always seem to think they are making an Orson Wells movie. Camera people: keep your egos out of it. Too many ill considered close ups at the wrong times. Too many shots of idiotic stuff like the parking lots, helicopters, the audience and everything EXCEPT the band INTERACTING. Groupies are less than boring, they're pathetic.

The backstage stuff is crashingly boring. One wonders if a monkey edited the movie.

Gave it 3 stars because I don't think it was the band's fault.",1229212800,,898,4.774193548387097
1404986,4,B000059H8N,"This is a fantastic DVD that gives you a taste of the wonderful world of Phish.  I don't understand the statements of some reviewers saying that Todd Phillips hates Phish.  He did a freakin' movie about them for cryin' out loud.  And a pretty damn good one.  Trey dominates much of the footage because (guess what Phish fans)...He dominates the band.  I've seen and read countless interviews, and generally he's the one who has the most to say.  It's not his out-of-control ego, he just happens to be more verbose than the other 3 guys.  And he is also the primary songwriter of the band and the obviuos ""ringmaster"" of the group in their live performances.  I miss Phish just as much as the next guy, but enough with all this Trey-hating.  He is a BIG part of what made Phish so special (and may again.)

I thought this film was great.  It captured the scene, the band, the music the personality.  Plus it was majorly cool to see the Great Wendt and remember what it was like to be there (that was actually my first Phish concert and my life was never the same afterwards.)

If you don't know Phish and are curious, check out this film.

If you are so hardcore that you argue about which was the best version of My Sweet One, then you'll probably complain about this film.",1148428800,8,1273,4.407725321888412
1404987,2,B000059H8N,"I bought this video a long time ago, and immediately sold it on ebay.  I watched it again recently, and still do not like it.  Why?  As many reviewers have stated it is the Trey show.  However, I really wonder if it was Trey's ego that took over the movie, or whether the other band members didn't like doing a movie?  I say this becaue Fish stated in an interview that at first he was for the movie and then changed his mind and didn't want to do it.  Maybe the rest of the band didn't like how it was produced.  So instead of scrapping the movie, Trey jumped and tried to complete it.  To save face for the band?  However, if Trey (and his ego) took over the movie, then I think offers some explanation of why the band split.

Aside from that, I gave the movie 2 stars because it does give fans a glimpse (however small) of the band off stage, and tries to incorporate the fans.  The only good parts are at then end.  However, the movie, in many respects, tries to be like the Grateful Dead Movie.  In that respect it fails. Ironically the director asks Trey about this subject (i.e. Phish's similarity to the Dead), which goes to show how little the homework was put into the project; why not ask about Zappa?  If you want to see a good jam band movie see the original... The Grateful Dead Movie. If your a phan of Phish, listen to the live shows.",1131580800,4,1350,4.202334630350195
1404988,5,B000059H8N,"This video shows the true character of the members of the band.  The video shows a lot of behind the scenes type footage including interviews, conversations and candid footage from the road.  The mixture of these elements mixed with the raw live footage exposes the reallity of the bands personality come to life.  This is the best video for people who don't know a lot about phish and want to understand the legendary phenomena.",1128556800,2,429,4.77027027027027
1404989,5,B000059H8N,"How a film-maker who has such obvious disdain for the band could have made such an entertaining documentary is pretty obvious when you think about it...it's Phish for pete's sake! If you already know you don't like Phish, then you wouldn't be reading this review so screw you. If you love Phish music and like laughing at weirdo hippies then this dvd is for you. don't worry about what songs/jams are shown and which ones were ommitted...that's missing the point..it's all one big organic whole.  it's the music that counts and the subtle messages you glean from it.",1125360000,3,566,4.775510204081633
1404990,3,B000059H8N,"If Bittersweet Motel were my first exposure to the band Phish, I am almost sure that I would hate them. Film-maker Todd Phillips certainly does. Given almost unlimited access to the band for a year, he seemed determined to portray them in a thoroughly unappealing light. He achieves this effect through a number of number of nails-on-the-chalkboard strategies, including posing inane interview questions ('Do you feel like a rock star?' and 'Are you rich'? are two of the dumbest), staging tastelessly manipulative ploys (like having band members read negative press reviews out loud and then respond to them on the spot), and filming the band while they are drunk after a show. Combine this with the generally mediocre live footage, eccentric song choices, and some tacky voyeuristic shots of bra-less fans, and you end up with a fairly disagreeable picture of the band from a documentarian who seems to equate such approaches with authenticity. On the other hand, it has to be said that the band give Phillips more than enough unappealing material to work with. Some of this, I am sure, was a product of the filming itself. It's clear that Phish disliked Phillips as much as he disliked them, and they sometimes work hard to be crass or obtuse, just for the pleasure of giving him a hard time. Other times, unfortunately, it seems to come to them fairly effortlessly. I was really disappointed by the glee they seemed to take in deliberately spoiling the pictures fans asked to have taken with them (their road manager would take the pictures and make sure everyone's heads were cut off) or the rather tacky fan-bashing song they cook up when drunk. This isn't Phish's finest moment. Of course, all of us can be asses at times, but most of us don't have a film crew waiting to capture those moments, and only those moments, with which to define us. Phish did, and it makes for a really mediocre movie. I've been a fan since 1994, and I'm not sorry I own this movie, but I doubt I'll watch it often. The unitiated might want to see their 'IT' DVD instead, or just download some of their hundreds of amazing live shows.",1121299200,19,2119,4.714285714285714
1404991,5,B000059H8N,"Let's get the negatives out of the way.  Yes, Trey gets most of the camera time.  I've heard it was just because he was more accessable during the filming.  Why then do we find extra footage of Mike and Page in the deleted scenes?  Oh well.  Don't worry about the quality of the sound...it's fine.  Critics are most likely audio geeks (just kidding - we all appreciate the tapers).  But seriously, the average fan will enjoy it just fine.  My experience watching it for the first time was very positive.  I joined the scene in 94-95, and the footage caught on the film (97-98) just captures a great year with the band - not some defining moment or their best concert ever - just some good times and good tunes with some insight into what goes into their creative process.  That's good enough for me.  Why argue if it should have been shot during different dates, if it should have had a different song list or something petty like that?  If you enjoy the scene, you'll appreciate the film.  If you are curious about Phish, don't expect this film to reveal some universal truth that IS the band.  It's a ""year in the life"" sort of documentary, not a history of the band.  Good job Todd, look forward to seeing more.",1075852800,3,1214,4.429864253393665
1405021,4,B000059H8N,"This dvd is one of the best music documentaries ive ever seen. i was throughly impressed w/ the concert footage. The insight from all the members was excellent too. i really enjoyed all the trey interviews. His remdemtion of sleep was sub par, but he still delivers a good performance w/o giving away that he messed up. The wilson track is unbelievable. this is a must for any fans. my only complaint is that they should of showed more concert footage of the ""great went"", instead of interviewing fans. i did the like the scene where a fan approaches trey at the great went. she almost passes out in mid conversation. as stated earlier this is a must for all phish phans.",1053302400,,671,4.508196721311475
1405022,4,B000059H8N,"Bittersweet Motel is a great DVD that documents the life of the musical group Phish.  Rolling Stone Magazine called Phish, ""The Most Important Band of the 90's"", and this DVD shows you why they are called that.  I would give this DVD 5 stars but the DVD seems to focus on guitarist, Trey Anastasio, a bit too much.  I would have liked to see more of Mike Gordon, John Fishman, and Page McConnell.  I also would have like to see more concert footage.  The DVD offers some great scenes too, my favorite being Trey buying the whip in Spain.  If you like Phish, buy this DVD.",1053129600,2,571,4.339622641509434
1405023,5,B000059H8N,This video is very fun to watch. Sit back and listen to the rockstars express their feelings about there musical career.

1405024,5,B000059H8N,"Doesn't get much better than this if you like concert movies.  Only rivaled by ""Stop Making Sense"" (Talking Heads) and The granddaddy fo them all, ""The Last Waltz"" (The Band & friends).  Mike Gordon is hilarious in this movie.  Watch what he does in his interviews.  Trey comes out looking like an ..., but what he lacks in kindness and humbleness he makes up for with incredible guitar playing.  Maybe he's not cocky, but just that good. A must have for anyone that remotely likes the music of Phish, Rolling Stones, Talking Heads, Ween, or basically any real music fan.  If you watch MTV on a regular basis, please don't watch this movie, your taste [is bad].  If you listen to top 40 radio, don't watch this movie, your taste also [is bad] and may God hae mercy on your souls.",1034294400,,779,4.4822695035460995
1405025,5,B000059H8N,"What else can be said of a band that has managed to slip below the radar of every mainstream ear, while at the same time drawing record crowds for their shows.  Bittersweet Motel did a great job of capturing the inner workings of a well oiled machine.  Equally as important, Bittersweet showed that out heros are human.  In my opinion this is what has made Phish into what they are.  My passion for music has led me to what I believe is the quintissential rock band of all time.  Bittersweet Motel give all phisheads a view of the band that has rarly been seen.  If you were a phan before, this DVD will only strengthen your love for the Phab Phour.",1029369600,,649,4.322314049586777
1405026,5,B000059H8N,"Although, I have to admit Trey came off a bit cockey on this DVD, I don't love phish for what they have to say, but for what they have to play. Arrogant or not, Trey is one of my favorite guitarists ever, and Phish is one of the best bands ever. It makes me sick that one poorly edited video could damage the reputaion of this truly legendary band.
The music in this DVD is as wonderful as it gets. Although Trey is the center of attention and the Phans are depicted as complete morons, the musical ability of the band still shines through. And shame to all those who will take one source, (in this case bittersweet hotel), to make judgement on the band. Have you forgotten all those awe inspiring concerts your been to?",1028332800,3,720,4.301470588235294
1405027,5,B000059H8N,"It's obvious that this film neglected a great portion of the vast and varied types of ""phish fans,"" but it would be impossible to display them all in 84 minutes, especially since the film is actually about the band itself.  The filmmakers overlooked, much to my chagrin, the sober fans who are often shunned among the ""phan"" community simply because of a personal choice.  Nevertheless, the film acheives what it set out to (with a few slight shortcomings).
Some have been disappointed by the prevelance of Trey in the film and the seeming  disregard of Page, Mike, and Fish.  This ""problem"" is addressed in the interview with Todd Phillips.  It turns out that Trey was, as we all know, more outgoing and willing to be on camera and participate with the producers and director.  Though Fish will easily expose his body to thousands of people, he's not one for gratuitous verbal exposition.  Page just likes to sit in his own little corner and do his own thing.  Mike seems to have some self-esteem issues.  These all impede the complete portrayal of the band's personal lives.
Personally, I watched this film for no reason other than the music.  As a bonus, I received: insight into Trey's humanity and difficult blend of sensibility and idealism; some spontaneous and completely genuine laughs; a brief peek at what goes on backstage; the knowledge of how Trey honestly feels about music in general and the music that he creates; and so much more.
With all of this though, the film would only appeal to persons who are already fans of Phish.  It is when Trey goes into exmination of modern music culture (in his SUV, after reading the concert reviews) and of the familiar underdog and hopeless dreamer (on the golf cart, just before the final concert footage), that the film reaches beyond the parameters of Phishdom.  These sentiments are so commonly felt by everyone, especially those who express themselves artistically, that they can affect the most avid fan of popular music, breaking through the illusive barriers of arrogance and disdain.",1016323200,4,2046,4.881502890173411
1405028,4,B000059H8N,"I think this documentary really captures the free wheeling nature of a phish show.  The music was cut into the film great and the editing was fantastic.  I couldn't help noticing that Trey is extremely full of himself in the film. It is no wonder the band is broken up with an ego like that around.  I only hope that they can reconcile and get back to playing tunes together.  After some of the dialouge belched forth from Trey I wouldn't have blamed Fishman from punching Trey in the eye.  I would have liked to have heard more from Mike, he seems to be the most interesting and unassuming guy in the band.  Page also came off as being a very professional and serious musician...",1014163200,2,680,4.4

Also, it helped that I was on the European and summer tours focused on in Bittersweet.  I found it to be a good intro for newbies and a nice scrap book for long time tour heads.  The only thing that I didn't like so much was it kind of made phans look either strung out ""druggies"" or just plain strange.  Other than that, there is some great live footage from shows and Jon Fishman is a phreak (in the best way possible).  I really dug it and I think that most phans will too.",1006473600,,587,4.205357142857143
1405030,1,B000059H8N,"Wow,I do dig Phish to some degree. But this video hardly about Phish. If you think that Trey is somewhat bright you may be amused. I would rather hear him play a blistering version of ""Stash"" than hear him speak. Maybe I am too critical because I am spoiled and listen to alot of Zappa and Grateful Dead so I know how bright a musician can be. Trey is NOT it. He pontificates like he Gods gift to rock and guitar. Hendrix and Zappa would roll over in their graves if they saw this because Trey is so arrogant.

However, Tray's attitude over shadows his bandmates excellent contributions. Perhaps this is the reason the band split for now?

1405060,1,B000059H8N,"I agree with Dirk Digglers review. I live in Burlington, VT and the talk around town is that the band split because of Tray's GIGANTIC ego that was displayed in this video. He was an arrogant jerk to say the least. The music was decent on here but I could not stand listening to Tray talk about himself over and over again. It seems as though he forgot that Phish has a few other musicians involved besides his beloved self. Everyone in the scene here is convinced that the band is done because of Tray's OUT OF CONTROL ego.....we'll see.",1003449600,4,538,4.39
1405061,4,B000059H8N,"I had a great time watching this DVD.  It was cool to hear the bands thoughts(mostly Trey) and coversations on things such as their first gig, and the ever-present associations with The Grateful Dead.
All of this was of course interlaced with Phish's music which sounds great.  The DTS and Dolby 5.1 soundtracks were indistinguishable to me, but that's ok because they both sounded excellent.  Complete songs are only included in the bonus materials.  The music in the film is just segments.  Of course it wouldve been nice to have complete songs in the film itself but for time reasons I'm sure they only include segments but it's constant throughout the film as you would expect, and as I said sounds great.
I agree with several previous reviews that it would've been nice to have more input from other band members during the film.  Hell, I could've watched this for 5 hours!  But I understand that they gotta keep the movie relatively short.  In a perfect world it wouldve been great to see all the band members get as much time as Trey and have this be a 3-DVD set.  Even still, the film does a nice job conveying the personalities of the different band members.  You definately feel like you can relate to them by the end of the movie.
Alot of people have knocked the director for his choice of Phans that he interviewed.  Again, with a longer movie maybe he could've done more but I can't really blame him.  These are some of the people that go to see Phish, like them or not.  And if you know nothing about Phish(as this director didn't when he took this film)...these are the types of people that will stand out and be memorable to you.  I think it's great..I mean you won't get these types of characters when Britney Spears comes to your town.(except maybe the frat-boys interviewed who would likely be there after some pre-teens).  It's unique to the jamband scene so why not show it in the movie.
All in all this is a truly enjoyable film.  For me it was too short, but for the non-Phish fan who is just watching it as a rockumentary maybe it's perfect.  And I do think this film could convert those who haven't heard Phish...perhaps I'll try it on some of my friends.",1003104000,,2180,4.506361323155216
1405062,5,B000059H8N,"It's simple.  If you like Phish, then your going to love this movie.  I think its one of the best movies ive seen in awhile.  Trey isn't cocky at all so I don't know why people are saying that.  If you like phish, buy it.",1002153600,,221,3.8444444444444446
1405063,1,B000059H8N,"I have to give Phish credit for being decent musicians. However Trey Anastasio is the most self centered person in all of rock. He was so cocky in this video it leaves little to the imagination why the band is on break currently. For those of you who like to compare Phish to the Grateful Dead...think again. Just watch this video and think about all the interviews you may have read or watched with Jerry Garcia. Jerry was far more talented and he never uttered the words ""I"" or ""me"" in an interview. He was the most modest man in rock. Trey on the other hand can't get enough of himself. His favorite words are ""I"" or ""Me"". I was litterally embarrased listening to him speak. I live in VT and if I ever have to chance to meet Trey I'd love to ask him where he get's off with that attitude. How great can he be if his music only appeals to stoned 15 year olds? Perhaps the rest of the band realized that already....",1001894400,3,916,4.2102272727272725
1405064,3,B000059H8N,"I love Phish and I was excited to see a movie capturing the behind the scenes mayhem and what not.  I was not pleased to find out that it mainly consists of Trey's thoughts on the band, Trey's playing, and pretty much all things Trey.  It really looks like the other band members were not really into the whole documentary thing and sort of retreated to the background thus forcing the director to focus on the frontman, Trey.  There is some great concert footage, and it is understandable why there are only clips, the movie would just be way too long.  The full length songs are a definite bonus.  I do have one major problem, the sound on the live concert portions of the movie seems really muddy, there is some weird compression going on, I can't tell if it is my system or the DVD, i suspect the latter.  Another problem, the 'phans' they chose to film REALLY brings this movie down.  It doesn't speak to highly of us REAL fans or the band for that matter.  I mean what the hell do I care about some drunk and high kids talking about random stuff, or an annoying hippie chick sucking on a nitrous balloon on the verge of passing out.  Oh, but my favorite part was the five minutes devoted to a bunch of ugly naked people.  Now I'm not that shallow, but there is just some things that I don't need to see....I think some of you will understand.  Overall is is a good DVD, you might find yourself getting a little annoyed by Trey, but other than that it is enjoyable.  Get it if you are a true fan of these guys, if you are on the fence borrow your friends copy.  Not a must have, but solid.",1000684800,9,1594,4.23841059602649
1405065,4,B000059H8N,"My problem here is that the filmmaker tried to make 3 films and didn't do any of them very well, though when I got the DVD the movie was better than I remembered from the theater. I thought that the concert footage was great, but since he almost never gives us a complete song, the tension and release that is behind many Phish jams (as well as entire sets) was missing. He could have done a Phish interview movie, but it became increasingly Trey-centric as the rest of the band lost interest in being followed around and filmed. Or he could have done a film about the ""scene"" and the fans, which he scratched the surface of. I agree with the other reviewers who said that Phillips appeared to focus on some rather shallow fans.  It would have been interesting if he would have interviewed some of the tapers -- people who feed a worldwide network of collectors with remarkably high-quality recordings, and their own special subspecies.  By trying to do all three things at the same time none of them were very good. I liked the exras, with more or less full length versions of several songs.",998524800,3,1092,4.51010101010101
1405066,3,B000059H8N,"As a ""phan"" since 1994, I've been following the band pretty closely for a while now.  I was really excited to see a feature-length documentary about one of my most favorite bands... and I was disapointed.
 Todd Phillips, the man behind 'Slacker', was hired to make a movie about a band he knew nothing about.  He almost did a good job.  He does a pretty good job with the music, catching the band's goofy side as well as their passion for the music.  There's a bit too much of Trey Anastasio, Phish's guitarist and singer, but that's okay, I guess.
 What really bothered me was the depiction of the fans.  From drunken frat-boys to brain-fried hippies I found that Phillips used the weirdest and most brain-dead to represent Phish's huge fanbase.  This puts a fan like me in a weird position: I've been misrepresented.
 After the movie was over I felt weird about it.  It was neat to watch the band -- behind the stage -- but I didn't feel good about Phish -- I just felt... weird.
 The DVD, by the way, is pretty cool.  The trailer for the movie is great -- one of the best, in my opinion.  The deleted scenes are cool too.  My favorite is Mike Gordon trying to answer the question ""Are you rich?""  Funny stuff.  Finally, full length concert performances that didn't make the film are wonderful.",997747200,2,1296,4.4743589743589745
1405067,5,B000059H8N,"After seeing Bittersweet countless times, I now feel an even stronger connection to our generation's greatest group. Trey, Jon, Mike, and Page are all exceptionally talented musicians, genuinely down to earth people, and the sources of hours of fresh entertainment. This documentary captures the very essence of Phish more than anything else, except for a live show experience of course. Every phan must have this.",996019200,,414,5.384615384615385
1405068,5,B000059H8N,"The overall quality of this movie is excellent. I was there in person for almost all of the US concert footage and the movie does a good job of capturing what you would see at a live show with one big exception, the film in extremly ""Trey-Centric."" The majority of the concert footage and Q+A is focus on Trey. The film should mirror the orginal idea of the band which was to have equal airplay for all four members. Perhaps the movie should be entitled ""Trey."" Besides the fact that it is Trey-centric, I think the film is excellent, the sound is good, the behind the scenes looks give a little sense of how the Phish machine is run and you get a good sense of the personalities of the members. I really liked how the film didn't focus on the Phans. The media tends to cocentrate of the wacky Phan-base instead of music, I guess Phish allowed the documentary with the notion that it would center around the music. Overall, the film is great but there is one minor detail that should be mentioned, the DVD menu system for this DVD is extremly poor. The interface is buggy and the animations are terrible.",995760000,6,1104,4.416666666666667

1405110,2,B000059H8N,"The DVD wasn't bad if you wanted to know every little background detail about the band that they could squeeze into 2 hours.  I found myself saying play some... music already.  When they did it was only a 30sec to 2 minute tease.  Bottom line if you are looking for a Phish concert on DVD, this is not it.",990835200,3,305,4.135593220338983
1405111,5,B000059H8N,"What can I say? Plain and simple: Amazing! If you like Phish you are gonna like them a lot more after you see this. If you just like Rock music and good Jammin' then you will not regret buying this movie.  It is true that there seems to be too much of Trey and not so much about Page, Mike and Fish; but the concert footage is incredible, and the back stage stuff is very funny. I think the director did a great job putting this film together. Great to see the boys playing live during the Hiatus.",989798400,,497,4.071428571428571
1405112,4,B000059H8N,"This is an excellent DVD although I must say I was slightly disappointed because it was so short. There are a lot of highlights though like when Trey goes gun shopping in Barcelona. That was hilarious! There is a lot of conert footage that is cool too. Highlights include hearing: ""Roses Are Free"", ""Waste"", ""Wilson"" and all the additional stuff on the DVD (""Punch You In The Eye"" ect.) are amazing. This video in my opinion focuses a bit too much on Trey Anastasio and I wish there was more of the other 3 members. I can tell that Fishman is a funny guy and would have liked to have seen more of him. Todd Phillips, who directed ""Road Trip"" is someone who knows what he's doing so maybe everyone else was burned out and didn't want to be in the spotlight. Heck, Trey pretty much banged out ""Farmhouse"" by himself so its probably good that Phish is taking a break from touring this year. Like other reviewers, this movie brought back memories from seeing the band live and hopefully Phish hasn't taken the stage for the last time.",987552000,5,1030,4.455026455026455

Anyway, the film gives you a new perspective on the band (like Trey playing with a .357 Magnum).  Speaking of Trey, he's pretty much the star of the film.  More Trey scenes than anything else.  I'm a gutar player, so it didn't bother me one bit.  The live footage is absolutely fantastic! It's great to see professional footage of the band.  Bootlegs are cool, but..............
