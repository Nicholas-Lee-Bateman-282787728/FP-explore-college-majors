8308767,1,B001HHUEG0,"Do not waste your money on this DVD. I want to watch great technique, footwork while listening to a good soundtrack, instead, you have these two alcoholic brothers talking rubbish half the video in a jacuzzi.  The soundtrack sucks, I recommend paradigm shift instead.",1356566400,,267,5.068181818181818

8308769,5,B001HHUEG0,"I totally reccomend this movie for any one who surfs a longboard. or is thinking of starting It captures the essence of a new movement in long boarding. And if you happen to be a Malibu surfer, all the better because you will recognise the whole cast of characters",1226448000,4,264,4.408163265306122
8308770,5,B001HHUEG0,"Great movie. Great double feature concept. I really like them both
equally. The ""Profiles"" are a study in style. It's hard to believe
anyone surfs as good as some of these guys. I hope watching them will
rub off on me. The Marshall brothers are amazing. C.J. Nelson and
Oliver Parker's switch stance are ridiculous. The young guys
especially Sam McClennan and the Robbins brothers are an amazing look
into the future of surfing as well as Christian Wach. Bonga Perkins
style and power as well as Taylor Jensen's airs are also stand outs.
Kevin Connely  and Josh Baxter are killing it too. I could go through
everyone. The women were great also. I actually liked all the
profiles. The highlight of the ""Days"" movie was the Marshall brothers
in the hot tub reflecting on style, their own and others, very funny.
Those guys are amazing. The Swamis, Wedge and Huntington Beach
sections also were outstanding. The biggest Swamis I have ever seen.
The H.B. section had 3 world champs , Colin McPhillips,Phil Rajzman
and Matthew Moir  as well as two guys who could be Kai Sallas and
Brendann White. I love this movie and will be buying copies for all my
surfing friends at Xmas.",1225324800,4,1171,4.679611650485437
8308771,5,B001HHUEG0,"Longboard Habit is a ""must-own"" DVD for any real fan of the sport. In this latest offering the guys have caught the best surfers on the West Coast doing some of the most difficult moves you can do on a longboard. Fin first takeoffs? Check. Insanely long backwards ride while hanging heels? Check. Hang Five with your other foot dragging in the wave? Check. It's all here.

Interviews with notables such as Josh Farberow, Carla Rowland, Cassia Meador and many more give great insight into how surfers at this high level view their peers. Farberow's description of Chad Marshall is almost worth the price of admission by itself.

There are too many great surfers in this DVD to comment on them all, just believe that there is a great representation of the old school, new school and everyone in between whether they are male or female.

On top of the surfing they have branched out on the soundtrack and gotten some great tracks; one of my favorites is an unsigned band
called JuRan's Oath. Never heard of them but check out the track in the Marshall Brother's clip. Good on Richard and Paul for breaking out of the typical surf music or grindcore soundtracks that are used in most surf vids.

It is impossible not to be stoked after watching this one!",1225238400,6,1250,4.617117117117117
8308772,4,B001HHUEG0,"This video is very good with lots of action at Malibu. There are very interesting shots taken of surfers, usually noseriding, from a hand-held camera following behind. A great video to pick up tips on how to improve your longboarding.",1225238400,2,234,4.875
