7793142,5,0849958261,This is an excellent series that we have in our church library.  This was a replacement for an item that wasn't returned.,1496880000,,121,4.5
7793143,3,0849958261,"First of all, I will tell you--this series does not attempt to copy the beloved radio show very closely. If you know that and still want to continue, here is my opinion.
It is a dark and stormy night. Combining a suspense movie and a radio bulletin about an escaped convict, Connie and Dylan become convinced that one of the guests at Whit's End is a dangerous criminal. Tension escalates as events pile up 'evidence' and Connie, Dylan, and even Eugene become caught up in the delusion-a false conviction that may ultimately put some of them in real danger.
""A Stranger Among Us"" as I said, has no relation to the radio show ""Adventures in Odyssey"", and I cannot say it is a classic, but there are far worse films to show to your kids. It is a fairly tolerable film for adults and probably interesting to some children. During the climax of the story a scene in which Eugene chases  the 'criminal' (on a skateboard, no less) occurs. Boys may like the action and humor, and girls might be attracted to his motive (rescuing Connie). Although I have never observed any nervous reactions from anyone, it is possible some children may become unnerved by the more suspenseful portions. For children old enough to effectively analyze films, this show is a good example not only of the danger (admittedly, taken to extremes here) of jumping to conclusions and the tendency of the human mind to interpret events in light of what it already believes. However, even though some may call it 'preachy' (its message is fairly evident) it is still entertaining, so the kids may not mind being fed a lesson in the process.",1323475200,,1606,4.654929577464789
