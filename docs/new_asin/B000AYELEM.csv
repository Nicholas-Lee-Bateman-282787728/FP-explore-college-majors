2397095,3,B000AYELEM,"Underneath all the incest, sadomasochism, drugs, and orgies is a terrible tragedy. It is the tragedy of a young man in need of the love and guidance of supportive parents who is then cast into a world of wild hedonism by his mother.

A young man returns from Catholic boarding school in France to visit his parents in the Spanish Canary Islands. With the death of his father, the young man is swept up into the world of off-beat sexuality in which his mother engages on a nightly basis. We see a range of sexual adventures Pierre engages in first with his mother's girlfriend,Rea.  His mother then sets him up with a young heart breaker beauty, wise beyond her years, named Hansi, with whom he falls in love. Thus, the mother insures he is initated into sexual intercourse and then falls in love as part of her plan to fully initiate her son into the adult world of sexual desire and fantasy.

Yet, the strength of the screenplay and the acting of Louis Garrel is that underneath it all we see a young adolescent man trying to seek his parents love and coming up shorthanded. As Pierre makes love to Rea in an after-hours shopping mall, his eyes follow his mother watching the public intercourse from a distance.

I did not find the film especially erotic, despite the vast range of sexual acts and nudism. Instead, I found it profoundly tragic and sad. The film breaks many taboos, but the most painful taboo broken was a mother who substitutes sexual initiation instead of affection and love for her only child. At one point you realize that Hlne, played very well by Isabelle Huppert, wants her son to experience all this hedonism so that he might understand her. If only she had made the slightest effort to understand him.",1141084800,11,1727,4.597402597402597
2397096,5,B000AYELEM,"Here you have a group of conflicted people. A mother empty and void of hope, feels shes a loveless slut and abuses herself with sex and alcohol. A son who is tempted and lead into a life he is not ready for, his vulnerability, desire and hunger to be accepted and loved by his parents and God.

His religious upbringing conflicts with his new lifestyle. The film leaves you thinking. The mother who realizes she is dragging her only love into her world and wishes to save him but he is already tainted. You really have to watch this film more than once in order to understand it.

However, while watching this film I had the feeling we still get a much cut edition here in the states. I felt that there were things left out which made some of the characters underdeveloped. But you do find yourself caring for the mother and son team.",1139961600,4,834,4.374193548387097

2397098,5,B000AYELEM,"How can you make a movie about incest and S&M not too revolting?

Well you can with Isabelle Huppert and Louis Garrel. Huppert plays a sex charged woman who has decided to show her son who she really is. She is into S&M, sex with multiple partners, bisexual sex among other things. She wants her son to love her for what she really is. However, she also introduces him to her own world. Pierre,(Louis Garrel) is desperate for his mother's approval and he wants to please her in every aspect. The both of them start a very dark and creepy journey in the world of pain, and people who dislike their sex without it. Religious regret, repentence, death lead to the shocking end of this twisted, complex, and well acted drama.",1136419200,6,721,4.5038167938931295
2397099,3,B000AYELEM,"You've got to respect Isabelle Huppert. She does not avoid shock or controversy in her choice of films and her performances in them. ""Ma Mere"" could not have been made without her, or at least not made as unblinkingly. Heterosexuality in all its permutations, save that of love and commitment, provides the subtext for this adaptation of Georges Bataille's postwar French novel. A teenager is just coming of age and coming home from boarding school where his hedonist mother is, literally, laying in wait. The novel's narrative, updated to today on a sandy vacation island, would be right at home in an ancient Greek theatre.

As she was in ""The Piano Teacher,"" Huppert is cast opposite a man (Louis Garrell) young enough to be her son, which is precisely the point. The picture is really about him and how he is pimped out and ultimately seduced by his mother. He parades about naked and, in some perverse way, seems to be asking for it. Indeed, all the sexual couplings occur in full view of others. The eroticism (S&M, bondage, incest) never crosses over into pornography, but it just might at any time, giving ""Ma Mere"" a momentum it otherwise lacks. The bodies and locales are so beautiful it's hard to take your eyes away, even if your mind is off wandering a bit.",1130889600,32,1270,4.695067264573991
2397100,3,B000AYELEM,Ma Mere is a sexy and disturbing French film. Sometimes the action on screen is hard to watch and will leave you baffled. Huppert's acting is great (as always). The scenary of the Mediteranean is beautiful too. A decent movie considering the topic.,1130457600,,248,4.790697674418604
2397101,4,B000AYELEM,"'Ma m&egrave;re' is a film on the edge.  Director Christophe Honor&eacute; (who gave us the little jewel 'Closer to Leo') has adapted a tough book by Georges Bataille that explores incest, sadomasochism, love, family dysfunction, and nebulous moral values of conflicted adolescents caught in the web of sexual investigation.  It is filled with difficult scenes and ideas and certainly is not a film for the faint of heart or spirit, but at the same time it is a brave film depicting the dissociative state of sexual mind to which we've come after the influences of such thinkers as Bataille, Foucault, Derida, Gide, and others.  Christophe Honor&eacute; captures an impossible story extremely well on the screen!

17-year-old Pierre (Louis Garrel of `The Dreamers') is a spiritually challenged adolescent home from his Catholic school to be with his mother H&eacute;l&egrave;ne (Isabelle Huppert) whom he idolizes and loves and see his father (Philippe Duclos) who is distant in every sense.  H&eacute;l&egrave;ne finds it necessary to inform Pierre of her background (her husband raped her when she was very young, causing such anguish  that she has become addicted to a life of immorality as a means of escape), a means of warning him of what close association with her could mean.  Pierre is blind to all things negative about H&eacute;l&egrave;ne and with the news of his father's death, he demands to be included in the wild sexual life of H&eacute;l&egrave;ne and her female lover R&eacute;a (Joana Preiss). H&eacute;l&egrave;ne is sexually attracted to Pierre and elects to include him in her games of voyeurism (watching Pierre during intercourse with R&eacute;a, introducing him to the shallow and compulsive Hansi (Emma de Caunes), mutilation, and all forms of debauchery.

The group goes to the sunny islands off Spain where Pierre falls in love with the dangerous Hansi and follows her lead in learning about his mother's strange and dangerous proclivities, sexual acts which include the involvement of young Loulou (Jean-Baptiste Montagut), a young man whom they torture for the sake of sexual satisfaction.  All the while that Pierre is being introduced into H&eacute;l&egrave;ne's bizarre world he is conflicted by his superego in the form of the Catholic Church: he is seen reciting catechism in the desert surrounded by a silent, nude Greek chorus a la Fellini.  Ultimately the 'vacation' is over and Pierre returns home with H&eacute;l&egrave;ne and the ultimate incestuous aspect of the Oedipus complex plays out in a completely bizarre and very dark way.  To say more would destroy the impact of the ending.

Isabelle Huppert is brilliant as always, her quiet outwardly plain demeanor disguising the profoundly ill soul inside.  Likewise Louis Garrel makes the fragile, gullible, needy and severely conflicted Pierre understandable: we may not agree with his choices as he wades through the strange waters of perversion, but we never lose sight of his vulnerability and passionate need to be loved.  There is a lot of graphic sex in this film, but this particular story could not be told without it.  Christophe Honor&eacute; manages this strange tale by letting the story take us into the realm of the unreal and he never for a moment loses our interest.

Even the music scoring is substantive, using Samuel Barber's own setting of his famous 'Adagio for Strings' for the choral 'Agnus Dei', most appropriately heard when Pierre is mentally visiting his spiritual conflicts with his corporal deeds.  This is clearly not a film for everyone, but for those who admire the French cinema history of uncovering strange tales, this is a fine example.  In French with English subtitles.

2397102,1,B000AYELEM,"Last week I saw a movie called ""The Aristocrats"", a documentary about the world's dirtiest joke. I didn't like that movie not because its content wasn't interesting, being able to see the way comedians work and what they find funny, but because the joke itself is not funny. It's vulgar just for the sake of being vulgar and that's not funny. Well here is a movie that is vulgar just for the sake of being vulgar. And guess what? It's not entertaining.

 I don't mind violence or nudity in a movie. All I ask is that there be a justification for it. Have the violence or nudity serve a purpose. For instance I would never tell someone don't go see ""GoodFellas"" because the language is too extreme. The language in that film is fitting giving the subject matter. Although I don't know any mobsters, I would imagine that that is how they talk. Therefore it is justified.

 ""Ma Mere"" stars the wonderful French actress Isabelle Huppert as Helene a woman who's husband has just died and now she and her son, Pierre (Louis Garrel) must find a way to cope with it. Or do they? We sense Helene didn't love her husband, she later admits she was cheating on him. And we sense Pierre didn't love his father either. There is also a feeling of incest in the air.

 But what is ""Ma Mere"" really about? I haven't a clue. We never at any point in the film come to understand these characters. Who are they? What was the relationship between father and son like? Why does the son hate the father and only like his mother? Why did Helene cheat on her husband? What has lead these people to become how they are? These are all very important questions that this film doesn't address. In another movie that would have been the whole point. Another movie would focus on the people. This movie just focuses on their actions. That is not as involving because if we don't know who these people are, why do we care to watch them?

 Giving the theme of incest some audience members might be tempted to compare this movie to Bernardo Bertolucci's ""La Luna"". That movie received a lot of harsh criticism upon its release, but compared to this movie ""La Luna"" is a masterpiece of the highest order. At least in that movie we understood the characters.

 Isabelle Huppert has always managed to pick some fine roles. I enjoyed her in Claude Chabrol's ""Merci pour le Chocolat"", ""Time of the Wolf"", and ""The Piano Teacher"". She has always played characters that seemed to be a mystery. Roger Ebert says she has a great Buster Keaton face. We are intrigued by her. And some people may be intrigued by her character in this movie but it is not because of fascination. It is because of bewilderment. And Louis Garrel is a walking zombie. You may recall him in Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"" but here he has no personality. It is just one embarrassing scene after another with him.

 Viewers should know that the movie is rated NC-17, and for good cause. There is a lot of nudity in the film. If you are truly offend by such material, consider this your warning. Stay away. But even if you are not offended by such material stay away anyhow. Here is a movie that is as boring and meandering as ""The Brown Bunny"". * 1\2 out of *****

 Bottom-line: An absolutely pointless film. We never come to know who these people are, what do they want? I'm not sure what it is the film wants to say, if it wants to stay anything at all. The movie is junk!",1124409600,14,3402,4.448553054662379

She leaves her son to experience other things, with her younger `femme fatale'. Yet he is not left alone; the final challenge. A companion is provided for him. Over time, revelations emerge. The film concludes with a consummation; one that will shake some and bemuse others. Yet, that is what challenging cinema is supposed to do, I think. At the very least, it illustrates some of the contortions of love.",1304294400,2,739,4.648854961832061

In a world where there is no absolute truth and no right or wrong, where every tenet of beauty is thrown into the trash (ie postmodernism in all its hell/glory) this film is the product and final example.
A bad remake of a film on Oedipal themes that's been done a million times before (mainly by  French ""auteurs"") ..with nothing redeeming about it. Facile, shallow characterizations of morally defunct and corrupt people mixed with lots of bad, cheesy sex scenes. I fast forwarded through some parts and then went back to see if I'd missed anything, and it was more of the same, disgusting, debasing interactions between sick people with no conscience or humanity.

2397196,3,B000AYELEM,"Watching this, I couldn't help but feel bad for Pierre (Louis Garrel). His parents are completely deluded in their sexual fantasies. No wonder he is found masturbating everywhere in unexpected places. Since he had just come out of a catholic boarding school I can understand why. Little Pierre is suddenly submerged in a careless escapade of orgies. He thinks he wants his mother's girlfriend Rea, but finds himself attracted to his mother as she is to him. I figure this is because she really loved her son (obviously), but more than just a lover. Remember his mother, Hlne (Isabelle Huppert), is promiscuous, but she thought about her son a lot and grew worried when she thought he forgot about her. They slept together, but not in a lustful manner at all. Hlne tried to prevent this from happening by sending the attractive young Hansi to Pierre. It's a rather complex situation. This film reminds of Savage Grace, only in reverse. I think this film does not do justice for the book. The actors did well, very natural. There was just something about the film that wasn't cohesive. I think more editing and shorter scenes would have made the difference, or a different scene of people, or location. It wasn't that erotic for me. Those scenes were akward, except for the climax. The music was fine. Isabelle Huppert is honestly just too cool for everyone else and the differences of the actors didn't really mesh well.

The only drawback that I could find was that I felt the movie did not explore the issues that it presented deeply enough-the oedipal conflict, incestuous desires, and the taboo versus the accepted.

2397224,1,B000AYELEM,"This film explores the dark and primeval recesses of human sexuality. It is thoroughly disturbing and at times disgusting.

It is a story of a misguided mother (played by the amazingly talented Isabelle Huppert) and her pitiful 17-year old son Pierre. She is as promiscuous as it gets and after her husband's accidental death, she unleashes her totally mixed-up emotions (mostly sexual) via non-stop debauchery not knowing the detrimental effects on her teenage son. She claims to be a free spirited rebel, but a rebel without a cause is usually a stupid person.

Pierre's character is hopelessly pitiful. He seems to be perpetually confused and is mixing spiritual thoughts with untamed instincts interspersed with acts of sheer brutality & violence. His mother's upbringing style and pseudo indoctrination isn't helping his cause either. At times, he thinks that he is God and is running crazily on the streets. Eventually, he lets his jumbled emotions get the better of him and he lands up (accidentally) killing his own mother. The last few scenes in the movie will make your stomach churn.

Science has proved that all emotions such as affection and love can be chemically isolated as chemicals and neurotransmitters. There is a deep bond between mother and her children (the isolated chemical compound that causes this bond is now known), but as sapiens with an overgrown neo-cortex, we are also blessed with the ability to rationalize and tame the animal instincts.

2397225,1,B000AYELEM,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***

""Ma Mere"" 2004) directed by Christophe Honor stars the wonderful, brave, one of the finest French actresses Isabelle Huppert as Helene a woman who spends one summer at the Canary Island and whose husband has suddenly died in the car crash while on his way back to France, to his mistress. Helen is left with her 16 (or 17) years old son Pierre (Louis Garrel, Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers""). Pierre was brought up by his grandmother and came from the catholic school to spend his summer vacation with his parents who are more of the strangers to him. Here comes the first of many questions I had while watching this movie. If Pierre does not know very well his parents why he hates his father so much and is so attracted to his mother? We clearly see that Helen did not love her husband and had cheated on him and not just cheated but had spent most of her afternoons partying with her girlfriend - lover Rea engaging on all kinds of sexual acts. I wanted to add ""perverted"" but the director tells us through one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie that he does not believe in perversion so, I guess we should take all the events and the relationships as normal. I think that the writer/director is not interested very much in giving us any motivations, justifications and insights in the characters' minds and souls and that's why many scenes are laughable, awkward, embarrassing and boring, in spite the nudity, sex, and violence for which the movie received its very well deserved NC-17 rating. Do you want some examples? Here we go. Poor Pierre, odd and lonely, torn between his catholic upbringing and his unhealthy obsession with his mother, runs in the sands, fells on his knees, looks at the sky with anger and asks (God, I assume), ""Why do mothers always want their sons to be Gods""? Later in the same scene, an old woman appears and Pierre asks her if she wants to be Mary, mother of God. . There is also a nice scene at the father's studio. After her husband is killed in the accident, Helen gives to Pierre the keys from his father's studio. Pierre finds porno magazines (lots of them), throws them on the carpet, throws himself on the magazines making love to them and then he urinates at the magazines and everything else within his reach in the room. Then things become even more interesting. Pierre, his mom, and her friend Rea are in a cab going to a night club. Rea and Helen kiss and hug, then Helen fondles Rea's breasts while Rea promises to Pierre that her first kiss would be in his ""filthy bottom"" and she actually checks if it is filthy or not ....while Helen watches in amusement. Another night, Helene and Rea abandon Pierre and find him later, passed out in the street. Rea undresses him and has sex with him as the tourists pass by...while his mother watches. Back at the villa, Pierre takes part in an orgy with his mother, Rea, and Hansi (de Caunes), another friend of Helene's, a young and pretty blonde girl. It seems to me that anywhere in the world, Helen would be pronounced an unfit mother and the boy would be taken from her - not in this movie. Well, Helen feels that she gets too attached to her son and too interested in his sex education and she and Rea go away, leaving Pierre in Hansi's care. Hansi introduces Pierre to the world of S&M and tells him that his mother wanted him to do everything that she herself had done with Hansi and her many young friends...At one point, Helen realizes that she has lost her lust for life which for her means that she does not enjoy the sexual orgies anymore. She returns back and then two weirdest scenes follow which I won't reveal...and then the final credits accompanied by the Turtles' ""Happy Together"". You got the picture.

More than anything this movie reminds me an old joke that I recalled during the scene on the beach where naked Pierre is daydreaming and Helen in a white dress appears like a dream and whispers in his ear ""The desire reduces us to weakness"" or something like that. Here is the joke. A man comes to the talent agency and says that he's got a great act. When asked what it is he goes, ""Just imagine a huge theater with the audience all dressed up, the men in tuxedos, the ladies in the gowns, and there is a huge balloon hanging on the top of the ceiling. The balloon is filled with excrement. The music plays the lights are on...and then suddenly the lights are off, the music stops and I shoot the balloon from behind the curtains. The lights are on again, the music plays, the audience is all covered with crap and here I am on the stage - wearing a white tuxedo."" My guess is that Christophe Honor has told us this old joke and he is the one wearing the white tuxedo while the rest of the world including everyone involved in ""Ma Mere"" are covered with...well, excrement. Or like one of my friends said, maybe ""Ma Mere"" is a timeless masterpiece and I simply did not get it.",1170288000,4,4940,4.463495575221239

2397229,2,B000AYELEM,"As usual, the best thing about this Isabelle Huppert film is to watch the actress give her all in a difficult role, in this case a sexually perverse mother who engages in the sexual education of her son and eventually gives in to incestous desires.  However, even a great actress like Huppert needs a good script and director, and Christophe Honore has done a sloppy job with this one.  Based on a novel by Georges Bataille, the movie might have worked if it had been in the hands of a great director, which was the case of Michael Haneke's adaptation of Elfriede Jelinek's equally disturbing ""The Piano Teacher,"" which won Huppert several acting awards.  Instead, you get a mother and son who never ring true as believable fully fledged characters, in spite of the best efforts of the actors. Director Christophe Honore's discussion on the DVD of what he intended to do was far more interesting than the film itself.  He sounds very academic, though, which may have been his main flaw tackling this film.  The sex in the movie is intentionally disturbing, setting the stage for metaphysical reflections, but they just sound pompous and ridiculous (especially the connections between sex and religion).  The last scene, intended to be moving, is downright laughable and ridiculous.  Still, the attractive and talented cast gives their all... and you do have Isabelle Huppert on the lead... too bad the writer/director is not half as talented as his leading lady deserves.",1152057600,,1471,4.931174089068826
2397230,2,B000AYELEM,"The reason I was drawn to watching this so-called French art film is the participation of Isabelle Hupert whom I enjoyed from I Heart Huckabees. Watching her in this film is as repulsive as watching European Divas like Monica Belluci in Irreversible and Juliette Binoche in Damage. Very slow-paced, bad camera work, unflattering makeup. The actor who plays the son is very unattractive and unconvincingl. The supporting actresses effortlessly pulled off performances that resembled live home video footages. Hupert is a great actress and I admire her courage to be part of this provocateaur, but at the same time I wonder why she wants to add a film like this to her resume. Perhaps having been around for long time, and have done every role out there, it's time to play a oversexed singled mother who messes around with her boy emotionally, psycholically, and sexually. By the way, the film seemed a bit too long, and I was so bored that I had to fast-forward after one hour. This film really deserves one star, and the second star is for Huppert.

2397231,1,B000AYELEM,"No, no, no:  There is not a fine line between avant-garde and mindless gunk.  There is a chasm as wide as my credit card debt between the two, into which director Christophe Honore has plunged headfirst--along with his vapid yawner, MA MERE.  Intended to be shocking (I suppose), this barnyard turkey does in fact have some shock value. . .because it's so awful.

MA MERE is the Oedipal misadvantures of a bored yet twisted mother (Isabelle Huppert) who gets her kicks corrupting her impressionable young son (Louis Garrel) over the course of a kinky tourist season on the Canary Islands.  Huppert goes through the motions of her role robotically; young Garrel needs first a comb and then an admonishment to quit touching himself in public. The dialogue between the two characters is as flaky as the crumbs in the bottom of a cereal box; when Momma insists her beefcake son call her naughty names he complies--and when he complies he devolves into yet another wacky dimension of goofiness.

Yep, this is one messed up bunch.

But the problem is, they're not even interesting as messed up.  When two other playmates (Joana Preiss and Emma de Caunes) are thrown into the mix the plot still drips with blandness; even the depravity (and there's a lot of it) is boring.

Was that a bondage scene?  Hard to tell who slept through it more:  the actors or the viewers.

With its ridiculous, nonsensical dialogue, along with a laugh-out-loud ending (and this is supposed to be drama, mind you), MA MERE is as much avant-garde as a skunk passing wind.  Only the skunk's more entertaining.

Huppert gives great depth to her character, multiple dimensions and tacit, hidden motivations implied by gestures, vocal inflections, facial expressions, and body language.  Only an actress of Huppert's stature could pull a role like this off; she is one of the great women of French cinema, yet she has the raw sex appeal to make the role believable.
