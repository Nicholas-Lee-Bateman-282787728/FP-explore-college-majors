You can say, any longer, and it may be, uh, too much of a good thing. If you know Jack Haley at all, it's probably from his playing the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz. But he's been in a bunch of musicals, usually as a second banana character. Here, he nabs a rare leading man role. I only wish his character were more likable. Haley plays Stephen Kimball, self-centered war correspondent for the New York Chronicle. Kimball is in Paris but can't wait to return home and embark on the speaking circuit. He's written a book, you see, about his war experiences. Our egotist thinks it's mighty fine reading (it's not).

But transatlantic travel isn't so easy to finesse during wartime. To land a berth on the ocean liner, the SS Arcadia, Kimball has to chaperone back to New York a troupe of fifteen teenagers who four years ago went to tour in Europe and got stranded. Plenty of hijinks ensue when Kimball's martinet ways rapidly ruffle adolescent feathers and, lo, there's ""Mr. Rules & Regulations,"" the subject to pranks. What else? Well, throw in teen crushes, and Kimball's love-hate relationship with lovely chanteuse Kay Lawrence (Anne Jeffreys), a snub-nosed stowaway (Marcy McGuire), banned cablegrams coded in sappy love letter format to pass muster with the ship's radio operator, a suspicious ship's steward (Olin Howland), and a fuddy-duddy passenger (Chester Clute) who keeps having things dropped on his head and who bemoans: ""I think I'm haunted!""

It's also the kind of movie where the kids snag every opportunity to burst out into song. It's cool, though, because several of the songs are nifty. My favorite is the happy wake-up song, ""Seven O'Clock in the Morning,"" as belted out by Marcy McGuire in fine boogie woogie style. But it's Anne Jeffreys' ""I'll Buy That Dream"" that got nominated for Best Song, and it's nice that Jeffreys, who was dubbed ""the ghostess with the mostest"" in the Topper television series, gets a chance to be a vocalist. I also liked ""Heaven is a Place Called Home."" It's good enough that it gets reprised several times. It's disappointing, though, that Jack Haley didn't sing or dance.

Sing Your Way Home is a lightweight musical comedy, and it's something to pass the time with. For me, the biggest negative is Jack Haley himself, and it's not his fault, really. The script makes him to be so full of himself, it takes a while for him to have that turnaround and to win the audience over. Anthony Mann - yes, that Anthony Mann! - is at his least gritty, but he confidently steers the movie. If you're aware of Mann only thru his westerns with Jimmy Stewart, he also directed a bunch of musicals, including the Glenn Miller Story (with Jimmy Stewart) and Serenade (with opera singer Mario Lanza). So, compared to having to order around those two high-powered stars, what's a little boogie woogie for Mann? An above-average 3 out of 5 stars for this one.
