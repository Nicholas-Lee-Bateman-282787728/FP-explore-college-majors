Examples from Tiger, Snake, Monkey, Crane are the primary styles examined here. Some great material here but what kept it from a full Five Stars is that the tape is too short. I definitely wanted more! This was never put on DVD and now that Unique Publications is deceased I guess it never will be. It would be fantastic if Steve Grody would do a new and expanded version of this for some current DVD  Martial Arts publisher.
