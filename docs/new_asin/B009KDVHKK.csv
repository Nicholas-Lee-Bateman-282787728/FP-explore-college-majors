8542436,4,B009KDVHKK,"""Forces Occultes"" was a French-made short film (about 51 minutes) in 1943. The film was made with the influence of the ""Vichy"" government of France which cooperated with Germany during WWII. Several of the makers of the film were former freemasons who had renounced the oaths they had taken as part of that secretive, satanic cult. The film is buttressed with some extremely interesting DVD extras that provide a lot of healthy explanations on the motivations for this short film and its overall tone towards freemasonry.

About the film specifically, Maurice Remy plays the main character -- a French national legislator -- who is in a powerful enough position that he inadvertently serves as an obstacle to the growing freemasonic contingent within the French governing body. He is unaware of their existence until a cabal of the higher masons decides to approach him and quickly recruit and seduce him with the promise of favors given and received. It shows the give-and-take nature you automatically sign-on with when you voluntarily commit yourself to the cult of freemasonry. Remy's character sees the possibility of promotion, additional power and influence and quickly takes the bait.
***But thats the catch: before enlisting in such a cult, you're NEVER fully informed as to how far youll have to go for said cult.***

What follows as the plot advances, is a fascinating look into the shadowy, secretive world of freemasonry. The film actually walks you through its rites and rituals as Remy's character is vetted, initiated and promised higher honors IF he plays along with the overriding selfish ambitions of higher-ranking masons in the French legislative body. Some people may see this as a simple quid pro quo, but when there is a cabal within a legislative body that is conspiring to forward it's OWN interests while forsaking those of the French people, there's a problem.

The pacing of the film does feel rushed in a general sense as there is minimal character development. However, the purpose of this short film was more informative than entertaining. Although I wonder how much more effective a documentary-style film would be, a drama also serves its purpose in showing how this powerful cult operates, even if the characters are fictitious. How about when you apply these same circumstances to American governance? One need only realize how many different American politicians (not just presidents) have been oath-holding freemasons. In this sense, the film's dramatization is effective, especially when the masonic elders are eventually crossed by Remys character. I think anyone viewing this with an open mind will be more informed than entertained, but this doesn't detract at all from the film.

So why was an anti-freemason film made by Vichy-French collaborators? This is a question of ""policy."" Upon being elected Chancellor of Germany, Adolph Hitler's administration set about secretly investigating and then quickly cracking-down on freemason lodges and branches and offshoots thereof. Many members of these lodges were jailed and deported by the SS and Gestapo and this policy was expanded to territories conquered by (France, Poland, British Isles, etc) and under the influence of (Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, etc) the newly reunified Germanic peoples. I find it fascinating alone that this is still an oft-ignored policy enacted by Hitler's National Socialist administration. Imagine this difference between the WWII players when considering the freemasonic oaths of British royals and their servant Churchill (Knights of Malta as well) and the fact that both WWII US presidents were outward 33rd degree masons.

There is also an oft-ignored inner aspect of this German policy that surprises me even more: the inextricable bond between the tenets of freemasonry and the mystic/mystery school thought followed by Solomon when he went horribly astray. One only need study those base beliefs adhered-to by freemasons and expand from there to realize that during the later ""Babylonian Captivity"" this complete and total divergence from the original laws of The Most High YHWH (documented in the Old Testament) cemented many of the talmudic/rabbinic teachings of today. Many refuse to speak of this bond between today's jewry and freemasonry. Why? I think it's extremely important especially if that was an additional reason for the jailing of individuals during Hitler's administration. In that sense, it puts a number of uncomfortable truths front and center.",1457654400,2,4497,5.319268635724332
