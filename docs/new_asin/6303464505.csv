7847565,5,6303464505,"Is this the same France where, according to the media, over 100,000 anti-gay righters demonstrated against gay marriage?  I rented this movie a few years ago and was thoroughly intrigued, so I ordered a VHS copy from Amazon. Homophobic Hollywood would never make a movie like this despite MILK and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. I only wish Noir & Blanc was available on DVD.",1370131200,,364,4.870967741935484
7847566,3,6303464505,"Moody and atmospheric, this directoral debut by Claire Devers tranplants a Tennessee Williams story to 1980s France.  Something may have gotten lost in the translation.  The story of a repressed accountant who finds pleasure in the pain provided him by a sullen African masseur is disturbing, but ultimately too sketchy.  If you're going to plumb the darkest depths, there's at least a strong argument for going into some detail.  No, not more torture scenes, but some hint of the actual relationship of the two protagonists might help.",1078617600,,536,5.126436781609195
