Escaped Maniacs is the second live DVD to come out of the Stooges reunion, and, like the first one, it proves yet again that they haven't lost a step in delivering the goods live. Forget about last years terrible reunion album The Weirdness; these days the only place to witness the greatness of Iggy and the gang is on stage. There aren't many singers, past or present, who can electrify a crowd like Iggy, and nobody backs him up better than The Stooges. This DVD, taken from a 2005 Belgian concert, showcases a fifteen-song set with thankfully only three new numbers  so you get all of the first two Stooges albums with the exception of LA Blues, Ann and We Will Fall. For some strange reason they play I Wanna Be Your Dog twice.

 While the concert is well filmed and has clear sound, the DVD package has a few notable gaffes. For example, you can watch either the Original Version or the Directors Cut but theres no explanation of what the difference is. Different track-listing? Different camera angles? Who knows? Also, navigating the menus on the bonus disc is nearly impossible, as there is no cursor or any kind of indication of where you are as you toggle between options. The bonus interviews with the Asheton brothers give a good oral history of the band (although I could really do without hearing Scott Asheton praise Fall Out Boy), but when speaking to Iggy the interviewer suddenly seems nervous, and the questions are bad. Im happy to hear an hour-long interview with one of the most interesting figures in rock history, but dumb questions like Whats your favorite color? are a waste of both his and my time. No wonder a visibly bored Mr. Pop starts asking how much time is left less than halfway through the hour-long discussion. Dont let the crap bonus features take the focus away from the live show, which is totally worth your rocknroll dollar.",1453852800,,1906,4.6805970149253735

8266529,5,B0017LZ28Q,"Interestingly, I find the interviews more compelling than the concert footage. For one thing, they avoided playing any songs from Raw Power, which to my mind is the strongest Stooges album. [Update: I just now see from an Iggy docu on the disc that on the third album, the Asheton brothers were not there. I don't know how they could call it a Stooges album. By the way, Ron Asheton just died in January of a heart attack.]  [Update: according to wiki, the Ashetons were actually on it. Odd error in the documentary.] And in extension of that, I don't think Iggy is the greatest song writer on the planet, all my favorite records of his were done in collaboration with Msr. Bowie. (Bowie produced Raw Power. Iggy claimed he ruined it, but see what a classic it became.)

I am sure the girls still love Iggy, even at sixty. His stage persona is as kinetic as ever, he is fit, and he's continually fighting the tendency of his trousers to fall down. (I don't understand why he doesn't just buy a belt or suspenders...)

I always find it interesting when an artist manages to still be on top after 40 years. That's just a super-human accomplishment.",1237680000,2,1146,4.526570048309178
8266530,4,B0017LZ28Q,"Close your eyes, and you might be fooled into thinking this show is an early `70s Stooges set.  The performance quality is as raw as ever, Iggy howling over the treble-heavy explosions and shrieks behind him.  Open up, and you see a few more pounds, minimal stage violence and even the replacement bassist, the legendary Mike Watt (who knows these songs by working for years with brothers Scott and Ron Asheton), looking old.  Though admittedly a ""for the money"" show, you won't notice the bad blood just under the surface of this shaky reunion as the band tears through their compact-yet-fabulous repertoire (minus ""Search and Destroy"", sadly).  More interesting, however, is the hour-long, unedited interview with Pop by a nervous Tracy Landecker; an amiable Iggy discusses the early days, quotes Marshall McLuhan dishes dirt on Velvet Goldmine producer Michael Stipe and stands up midway to pop his back, shout a curse word and ask ""how much time do we have left?""",1219881600,7,967,4.987577639751553
