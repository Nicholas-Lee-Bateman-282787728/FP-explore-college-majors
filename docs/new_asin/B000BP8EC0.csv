8090433,5,B000BP8EC0,"The product represented on this Amazon webpage is Volume #5 in a series of 20 VHS videotapes that were released on home video by ""Nu Ventures Video"" in the early 1990s. Each of the twenty tapes contains two episodes of the 1960s TV series ""The Fugitive"" (with a special introduction recorded for each episode by one of the stars of that series, Barry Morse).

The two uncut hour-long episodes (minus commercials) that make up ""Volume #5"" are two of the finest shows in the four-year history of the original 1963-1967 ""Fugitive"" TV series. ..........

1.) ""Nemesis"" (from Season 2; October 13, 1964) co-stars Kurt Russell, Slim Pickens, and John Doucette. Russell plays Lt. Philip Gerard's young son, who inadvertently becomes the travelling companion of fugitive Richard Kimble (David Janssen). Police Lt. Gerard (Barry Morse) now has double the concerns in this episode -- he must try to recapture Dr. Kimble, while worrying about his own son's welfare at the same time. An excellent ""Fuge"" program.

2.) ""Ill Wind"" is the other ""Fugitive"" episode on this tape. This third-season installment is truly a wonderful and exciting program, which once again has all the ingredients that make this drama series so great. Lt. Gerard actually catches Kimble, and takes him into custody, in ""Ill Wind"". But while Gerard is transporting Dr. Kimble back into the lap of the law, they encounter a hurricane and are forced to take shelter in a dilapidated barn. Gerard is seriously injured when part of the barn's roof collapses on top of him.

Parts of the plot here are, indeed, a tad unrealistic, with Kimble saving the life of his pursuer (Gerard) not once, but TWICE, during this episode! But, it's still an exhilarating hour of television despite its implausibilities. Plus, the picture-perfect portrayals of the two leading characters, as played by the talented David Janssen and Barry Morse, make even the most unlikely and improbable situations seem more than convincing.

""Ill Wind"" contains one of the greatest endings of any ""Fugitive"" ever made, with Kimble slipping through Gerard's grasp once again, while a wounded and limping Lieutenant Gerard stumbles helplessly after his fleeing prisoner. This scene yields by far the best (and most agonizingly-futile) cry of ""Kimbllllllle!"" ever voiced by Gerard/Morse during the entire 120-episode duration of ""The Fugitive"".

The ""recapturing"" of Kimble in this episode is also a very chilling and highly-effective moment. Kimble is attempting to elude the Lieutenant at a train depot, and suddenly -- THERE'S GERARD! -- standing menacingly in the distant dark shadows of the railroad station. Kimble sees him, and knows he can't get away (at least until the end of this script at any rate). This Kimble/Gerard ""meeting"" is a great moment in the series. And, coupled with the first-rate ending sequence, it makes ""Ill Wind"" one of the all-time best ""Fuge"" eps. ever aired (IMHO).

""Ill Wind"", written by Al Ward and directed by Joseph Sargent, aired for the first time on March 8, 1966. Guest stars include the father-and-son duo of John and Tim McIntire, along with Jeanette Nolan, Lonny Chapman, and Lew Brown.

You might recall seeing the younger McIntire (Tim) in the 1978 film, ""American Hot Wax"", in which he portrayed pioneering disc-jockey Alan Freed. That's a very good film; and a fine performance by the then-33-year-old McIntire. Tim died at a very young age (41), in April 1986.

------------------

""Nemesis"" and ""Ill Wind"" make for a superb ""Fugitive"" double-bill. Try and catch these ""Fugitives"" -- if you can!",1131926400,3,3570,5.097602739726027
