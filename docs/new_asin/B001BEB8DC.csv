3489780,5,B001BEB8DC,This is a great product that teaches a true accounting of what to do in a life-or-death situation. Sammy Franco breaks down all instruction in a way that is easy to follow and understand. This product is a must have!,1415145600,2,216,4.425
3489781,5,B001BEB8DC,Very effective. Would not want it used me.,1413072000,,42,4.375
3489782,5,B001BEB8DC,Watched the DVD after I read the book. Was worth my time and money.,1411603200,,67,3.857142857142857
3489783,1,B001BEB8DC,"Poorly Crafted, Poorly written dialog, and after years of complaining that no where in the real world does anyone attack you like in Randori, or Zombie Drills, I am proven wrong... This isn't a system.  Save a great deal of money, time, and embarrasment and study Krav Maga. The book is just as bad.",1409961600,2,299,4.537037037037037
3489784,5,B001BEB8DC,"After 20 years of studying various martial arts, I thought I had a pretty good handle on what worked and what didn't. Needless to say I was skeptical.
I had never seen ANYTHING like this, in the first few minutes of glancing at the video while perusing the manual, I didn't see what the big deal was....until I sat up and paid attention that is! Afterwards, I saw the true genius of the methodology and it's brutal effectiveness, nothing else I've seen before or since even comes close....except for the Savage Street Fighting program. To be truly armed, you will want both. But start with this, it will blow you away, followed swiftly by anyone foolish enough to force you to use it in a self defense situation!",1395619200,2,712,4.5703125
3489785,5,B001BEB8DC,I recently purchased a BOB XL bag and wanted an instructional video. I ordered Sammy Francos Manniquin bag training dvd. I was so impressed that I ordered all of his dvds and books. I have been in martial arts for 31 years and have Black Belts in a few styles. Widowmaker Program is a practical and eye opening (or closing LOL)dvd. I really like the realism of Sammy Franco dvds. I give them my highest regards and recommend them to everyone interested in learning reality based street combat. His customer service department is second to none. Throughout the years I have viewed hundreds of self defense videos and none would compare to the realism of these. Excellent Products...,1246320000,3,681,4.779661016949152
3489786,5,B001BEB8DC,"I only have one thing to say about this program...it's innovative approach to ripping apart the moron who decided to make you a target is worth far more than the price listed here. When you see what this program has to offer, you'll sit there in  awe and you won't  believe how easy it is to just rip into someone who means you harm. Not only that but when you leave them a bloody mess, they'll understand that you're not one with whom to be trifled. Sound good? It bloody well should. Make learning this a priority as soon as possible.",1241481600,2,536,4.297029702970297
3489787,5,B001BEB8DC,"An outstanding self defense program!  The concepts are cleary explained and illustrated.  Sammy Franco is truly a leader in the ""reality based self defense"" world and this program proves it.  The techniques taught in Widowmaker will actually work in real world, life or death, situations.  If you are serious about learning to defend yourself, there is simply no equal to Sammy Franco's Contemporary Fighting Arts and the Widowmaker Program.  I was very, very impressed with Widowmaker and I highly recommend this purchase.

3489788,5,B001BEB8DC,"When I first heard about this product I was skeptical, but a friend insisted I check it out. Within a few scenes I had changed my tune.
I have a background in various traditional and non-traditional fighting styles, and I had NEVER seen anything like this.

If you think you have seen it all, you haven't.
If you think you know it all, you don't.

Sammy Franco has truly set a new benchmark in self preservation & systematic street fighting tuition.
Brutal, yet able to be executed by anyone willing to put in the training. If you do not want to be a victim of violent crime, then this is the Hummer of self defense vehicles.

Widowmaker training has changed the way I train, and the way I view my role in altercations. The DVD is divided into the teaching of both phases of attack, with various 'live' drills involving scenarios and static training methods for fine tuning the techniques involved. Well thought out scenes, for maximum learning potential. Presented and narrated by Sammy himself. 6 stars!

If you have any doubts about Sammy or his C.F.A system, check out his discussion forum, and ask around, you will soon change your mind.

8282727,1,B001BEB8DC,"A very strange and stupid technique that would even fail as a 5 minute youtube video. Also, dishonest to re-date a video '2014' when the actual video was taped in VHS or something many many years ago. All in all, the worst self defense footage I've ever seen.",1439769600,,259,4.416666666666667
8282728,5,B001BEB8DC,"The widow maker is an interesting approach using some very simple techniques and drills. I believe tis is worth practicing and adding to your arsenal of defense/offense approach. As Mr. Franco states, this is an unconventional approach and powerful. One thing that makes me identify with his way of thinking is, prior to watching this material, I had already the mental awareness of the effectiveness of attacking the face, eyes etc. he simply re-enforced this concept for me and his drill approach is awesome. Highly recommend this.",1438992000,,533,5.137931034482759
8282729,1,B001BEB8DC,"Poor production value!!! I don't know this guy's (Sammy Franco) background but when you google his name not much comes up other than people making jokes about him. Bottom line the video has some interesting facts and gives the viewer some good instruction. Again, very poor production value. A 5 year old could have made a better video!!!!",1438819200,4,339,4.862068965517241
