I suffered a stroke and had brain surgery which left me having to use a wheelchair so I thought yoga was out of the question for me forever until now. Fortunately, this DVD came out & showed me how I can do yoga from my chair. It's a great tool to have. It teaches you how to become aware of your breath & how to ease your mind as we all lead nowadays a more stressful life. Stress causes havoc on your health.

As a wheelchair user, I find that stress is just a part of daily living so having this resource teaching me how to ease my mind is wonderful! Becoming aware of my breath and helping me ease my mind leads to a more healthy life. Plus the DVD has a meditation section which is very soothing, relaxing and cleansing of the soul.",1396310400,,823,4.049079754601227

8628056,5,B00GWTX7XA,"Ageless Movement & Breath is an inspiring motivational DVD program that everyone can benefit from. As an RN in the medical field I work daily with surgical patients and their families. One of the first concerns of the surgical patient is the recovery period that will follow the procedure. My response is always the same. After surgery you have to move and breathe. Just keep moving. This DVD gives not only surgical patients but everyone the tools to gently but effectively be stronger, flexible, have more energy and just feel better!",1396310400,,536,4.9010989010989015
