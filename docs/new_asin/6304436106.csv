Don't judge the movie by this hastily written review: ADDRESS UNKNOWN is a great movie for all audiences. It moves you in a way few movies I've seen before does, while being realistic as well as dramatic.",1033776000,5,753,4.385714285714286

7872953,4,6304436106,"This is not a Hollywood blockbuster.  What is is, is a nice movie.  Scratch that.  A very nice movie.
If you're bent on finding holes in the plot, you'll probably find them.  But in overlooking them you'll find a very watchable, entertaining movie.  Even upon re-viewing it, it didn't drag and kept the attention of both adults and kids.
The young cast carry the story very capably.  There are such genuine (and awkward) moments of ""pure kid"" that I found myself laughing and saying, ""Yea, that's what it was like!"" (I love the scramble over the couch when mom suddenly came home and found the kids sharing a pizza and going over clues!).  The acting wasn't strained, or overdone as it can sometimes be with young actors.  They came across as so genuine.  The better-known adult actors did a fine job of stepping back and letting the kids carry the plot, providing just the right support.
It's a wonderful story about living with people missing in your life, finding meaning, filling holes, finding new ones to love.

It starts with a mysterious bag of mail lost.  A tragedy.  A young son missing his father.  Finding the bag.  A clue.  The search:  and all of the excitement and intrigue along the way.

Very ""small town"", family friendly, of ""After-School Special"" caliber.
As I've said, parts are far-fetched.  But hey!  Not every movie can spoon-feed you everything, and the imagination does need some exercise from time to time!",1329436800,,1433,4.752032520325203
7872954,5,6304436106,"Starring Kyle Howard, Johna Stewart-Bowden. Matt Kester (Howard) is a sixteen year old boy whose father died in a car accident 10 years earlier. One day, while he is exploring the woods with his friends, they come across a bag of undelivered mail. One piece of mail is addressed to Matt and is from his father. The letter leads Matt, and the daughter of the other man who died in the car accident, in search of a stolen stamp and the real story of how their fathers died.

Address Unknown is a great suspense-filled, family-friendly movie. The kids acting is great (I especially loved Matt's friends who are the comic relief in the movie). As with all family films, there are some unintentionally funny ""emotional scenes"".  Overall, worth watching.

Be aware that the story does involve murder and kidnapping. However, very little violence is shown.",1206748800,7,849,4.841379310344828
