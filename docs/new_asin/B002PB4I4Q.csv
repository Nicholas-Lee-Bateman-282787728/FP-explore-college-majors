3964177,4,B002PB4I4Q,This is a fun movie. It's a bit on the off/quirky side. But I liked it.,1265587200,,71,3.5
3964178,3,B002PB4I4Q,"I am a big Jeff Bridges fan and appreciate everything he has done and such, but I didn't feel grabbed by this one at all. Not that there were horrible performances or bad film making, it just had a slew of little things peppered throughout that made me not give this the above average recommendation.

The story follows a minor league ball player (Timberlake) suffering a slump, who has to get his famous big league dad (Bridges) to make a final visit to his estranged and dying ex-wife. Through some poorly staged events, they have to make it a road trip together across several states (instead of flying) to make this union happen. The scenery is quite beautiful in some of the sequences, and it even upstages some of the sparse dialogue as the long-parted kin find a way to re-connect. Kate Mara is the tag-along friend who offers the love interest of Timberlake, but the chemistry never materializes in ways it should have.

The Blu quality is average to below average, with the strong showing being the opening aerial shot of the baseball game (must have used a different camera - they usually seem to in those kinds of scenes). Some of the color/contrasts in the open road shots shine nicely, but the amount of indoor and dark sequences show several weaknesses. The 5.1 is uneventful, and the only supplement offers little insight other than some typical fluff. Did not get to the commentary as I could not venture sitting through this twice. Three for the film content and Mr. Bridges (the supporting cast of Steenburgen and Harry Dean Stanton are not present enough to warrant dissecting their screen time). I love road films so maybe this will give you some light entertainment on a slow night.",1258243200,5,1703,4.7114093959731544

This is another movie that I recently saw a trailer for on another DVD that I had purchased, and it looked like another movie that would be great to watch.  And man was I right again, it has an all-star cast, with a really great story line.",1410048000,,332,4.015151515151516

3964186,2,B002PB4I4Q,"Didn't care for this one.  No chemistry to the film.  Jeff Bridges is engaging as the happy-go-lucky ex-baseball player drunken good old boy, but you just get a feel of untruthfulness from the character.  There is no real warmth from Timberlake at all.  He keeps saying he loves Kate Mara, but it is not believable.  No magic.  I guess I don't think he is a very good actor and when I look at him I think -- shave that peach fuzz off your face, you look stupid.  Just a ho-hum movie at best.  You might watch it to fill time, but it is not much of a film.",1402790400,,555,4.074074074074074

3964189,4,B002PB4I4Q,"I have always loved Jeff Bridges, and this movie is another reason why!  It is such a sweet story, and I really enjoyed it.  J.T. is just adorable, as usual.",1378339200,,157,4.2
3964190,2,B002PB4I4Q,"This one isn't though. It's a rambling, aimless, often boring film, which also is more than just a little predictable.",1375920000,,118,4.95
3964191,1,B002PB4I4Q,"Some movies are just dumb.  It's sad when those said movies star talented actors.  Jeff Bridges is one of the best ever born, and Justin Timberlake is more than a pretty face (he can sing, he can dance and...yes, he can act).  Still, they cannot save a boring and ill-advised `father/son' bonding film from being anything but what it is, boring and ill-advised.  The storyline is a mixed bag of preposterous and clichd and the direction is so generic that it bears repeating.  I just wish that there had been some spark to be had here, but instead we get Bridges muddling through `too familiar' territory with nothing to really color in and Timberlake pouting and trying his hardest not to appear uninteresting.  Oh yeah, and Oscar nominee Rooney Mara's less talented yet more famous sister is here to play Timberlake's would be/should be flame who really warrants no mention whatsoever.  I would have loved to like this.  It's nice to have a light and frothy warm hearted film every once in a while.  This is just bland and forgettable.",1333065600,,1037,4.716666666666667
3964192,2,B002PB4I4Q,"The Open Road is definitely a disappointment for a couple different reasons.  For one thing, Jeff Bridges plays a fairly annoying father character more often than not.

Alright *sometimes* he's not so bad, such as -to mention the storyline in small detail- whenever Bridges son tries forcing his father to come back home and visit his ex-wife (the sons mother) in the hospital, and the character of Jeff Bridges constantly finds sneaky ways to get out of it such as sneaking off to a bar, sneaking into a bathroom, or just putting on an unexpected disappearing act.  Or was that woman supposed to be his *current* wife?  Who knows.  The storyline was hardly ever specific enough because it never developed to its full potential.

The film is supposed to be a light comedy with a sprinkle of drama elements to make you feel satisfied by the end of the movie, but well... the ""feel good"" moments are more like ""feel like total crap"" because they aren't actually any good either.  These particular segments focus on the teenage boy bringing his girlfriend to the location of Jeff Bridges, everyone getting into needless fights with each other in the middle of nowhere, and bringing the father back to the boys mother.

In addition to that, the storyline focuses on the confusing relationship troubles between both the son and his girlfriend.  So if anything, the film is supposed to show viewers what it's like for two adults to have relationship difficulties as well as two teens.

Yes that's right- I mention a trip.  Jeff Bridges, his teenage son and the girlfriend all travel across country on a road trip (and mostly find themselves in the small towns and fields of Kentucky).  Now I've seen my share of ""country road trip"" type films over the last 10 years, and this one is CLEARLY inferior to most.  It's one boring trip, that's for sure!

Jeff Bridges just never came across as an interesting enough main character to keep my attention very long.  Throughout the entire film, the only time I laughed was the moment where he got into a fight with his son, stormed out of the car, and fell over on the ground.  That was the ultimate moment of humor there... and it stunk.

I don't even recall any mention of why the mother was in the hospital to begin with.  Just that she insisted her son bring Jeff Bridges to her NOW.  I won't spoil what happens at the end, but let's just say, it was extremely melodramatic, making the build-up and the whole road trip very unsatisfying and pointless.  All the frequent baseball talk was pointless too.

The film is extremely brief at just over 80 minutes, and feels undeveloped and lacks focus most of the time.  A pretty big letdown.",1295740800,,2675,4.658848614072495
3964193,5,B002PB4I4Q,"Nearly everyone loves Jeff Bridges & Mary Steenburgen - of course - always - they are simply wonderful.  Justin Timberlake, however, is sneaking up on super stardom a subtle way.  If you'll really watch him in this movie, and in Black Snake Moan, you'll get it.  He's chosen parts (or someone has brilliantly cast him and he accepted the parts) opposite Jeff Bridges and Mary Steenburgen in this movie, Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci in Black Snake Moan...to really show his stuff - just, wow.  I was never a big fan of his music (too old), but he is just wonderful as an actor.  And Kate Mara - the perfect compliment here.  Thank goodness for Netflix for recommending movies for me to watch....otherwise I would've missed this one...so glad I didn't. It's listed as a comedy on Netflix, but really isn't - it's a touching story, romantic drama I guess, humor interjected along the way...surprising. I'm buying my own DVD now. Enjoy.",1287014400,2,941,4.742331288343558
3964194,4,B002PB4I4Q,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a very good story line. I had never seen Timberlake act before and he's not bad at acting. I've always like Jeff Bridges. This is mainly about a father (who is a has been country song writer and singer)and a son who is not very happy with his dad. They are stick together on a road trip to go see Jeff's wife and the kid's mother who may be dying.  They have not been close and this trip does not help them but it is a good story. One good thing that the movie produced was Jeff falling for a much younger woman who has a very young son that Jeff falls for. The mother breaks up with Jeff but because of his love for her and the child he cleans up his act. He quits drinking. Starts writting songs again and wins a large prize (I think $100,000). He runs into this young woman on a trip and gives her all his money for the kid when he grows up and for his education. Purchased from Amazon.",1286236800,,925,4.0
3964195,3,B002PB4I4Q,"I am a big fan of Justin Timberlake so I always like to go out and see his movies.  He is not one of my favorite actors.  He is my favorite music artist.  Anyway, I thought the movie was pretty good.  It was funny at times.  I thought Justin did pretty good.  I have seen all his movies and I can see every time he is getting better.  I thought he did pretty good in this movie.  Jeff Bridge character was just annoying.  Maybe because he reminded me of my dead beat dad.  I did rent it from the library but I would actually like to buy this one.",1275523200,,546,3.926605504587156
3964196,3,B002PB4I4Q,I was disappointed --Timberlake was not all that convincing but watching Jeff Bridges nail his role made this a worthwhile movie.,1272153600,,129,5.190476190476191
3964197,2,B002PB4I4Q,"Oscar winner Jeff Bridges try to be the glue in this piece, he tries too hard. His role as a self centered, washed up  Veteran Ball player who really does  not want to be the responsible one in life. He also is estranged from his son, who he has not kept in touch with for years.

Justin Timberlake shows his acting chops here. in this reviewer's opinion, He needs a few more classes, but he tries hard here. His role as a Baseball player who is in a bad playing slump. His mother (Mary Steenburgen) is refusing a heart operation unless she sees her estranged husband (Bridges). He bring his former girlfriend (Kate Mara) for support.

Bridges states he forgot his wallet, so they drive. The father and son try to reconnect, but each are too hard headed foreach other to let their guards down.

The film is disjointed tale of fathers and sons. There are times it clicked together on so many levels. Then  other times, the tempo and the dialog makes this film fall apart. Making this film more of a chores to view

This is the kind of film you want to rent after all your main selections have gone.
