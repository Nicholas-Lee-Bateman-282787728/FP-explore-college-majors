6680045,5,B00NTSRWMY,"I love it, of course! The movies are so much fun, and I wanted to have them since they remind me of my childhood.
The design of this Blu-ray is great, plus you have both of your movies in one box.
The quality is good; full 1080p resolution.
It carries an ""ABC"" Blu-ray region code, which means it can be played worldwide.
