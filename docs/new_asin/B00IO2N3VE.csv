6283507,5,B00IO2N3VE,This 4 + hour dvd not only show you how to use every aspect of the camera but also gives you lessons in photography on how to take quality photos.  You should go through the dvd 2 or 3 times if you are a new to digital cameras,1398297600,11,226,3.7083333333333335
6283508,5,B00IO2N3VE,"The first section is all about learning the basics of photography. I learned a lot. Using full manual mode is no longer scary. Which is great because you can't make creative choices unless you know the basics. The DVD is set up with chapter titles that make it really easy to go back and find what you need whenever you want.

The second part is all about the camera. I've learned every menu, screen, and button. I have personally found this DVD to be invaluable. Again - any time I get hung up, I just go back and quickly find the chapter and review again. Couldn't be easier. Michael, the instructor, really breaks things down into easily understandable lessons. I will recommend his courses to everyone I know that's interested in photography.",1394496000,23,746,4.651515151515151

6283513,5,B00IO2N3VE,This DVD is essential for anyone starting to use the Nikon D5300 DSLR.  It is very well organized and allows one to absorb the material in 'bite-sized' pieces and at one's own pace.  The best section is how to adjust the controls and settings to one's specific ideas on how to shoot pictures.  It is certainly superior to any of the videos I have yet to find on YouTube on the subject. Together with the David Busch's Compact Field Guide for the Nikon D5300 it gives the individual new to the camera all the material needed to get started to use it immediately with minimal fuss.,1429401600,3,579,4.443396226415095

6283517,5,B00IO2N3VE,"I bought this for my wife. So far she loves it. She says Michael explains everything in detail and very well. Knowing how frustrated she can get with technology, those comments say a lot about the video. Thanks Mr. Andrews for a well done job!

I will update my review when I watch the video myself.",1419292800,7,299,4.339285714285714

8643799,5,B00IO2N3VE,I actually bought this for help with my GX8.  The menu systems are so similar that it was a great help.  Michael's videos have the best information and tips !!  I would recommend this to anyone with Panasonic camera.  It has helped me understand my GX8 and my ZS100.,1497312000,,266,4.36734693877551

8643802,3,B00IO2N3VE,"An appropriate title should have been ""Panasonic GH4 Photography Crash Course: Made for Beginner's"". Even though we're quickly approaching the end of the line for the GH4's production historic run, there will still be plenty of future buyers looking to add this powerful tool to their gear bag.

It escapes me why anyone would approach the GH4 strictly as a photographic camera, but that's the target audience for this DVD. This is why I gave the generous 3- star rating. This DVD, however, is still woefully lacking in video production value and is only a handy reference for the absolute beginner looking to purchase a GH4 strictly for still photos.

If searching for insightful video info, this is a legit 1- start DVD and a waste of time / money. The problem is further compounded by all the bad info available on YouTube from respected videographers who shared useless setting suggestions.

Don't get me wrong, the GH4 is a crazy good video camera. If you understand the photographic limitations of the m4/3 sensor, it is also a great stills camera. Trying to dial in the right settings for video, on the other hand, is enough to drive you completely mad.

In fact, I almost gave up on the GH4 because of the horrible things it does to skin without the correct settings. There are over a billion potential video settings and it took forever to dial in the correct one that is not only cinematic, but accurate, pleasing to the eye and color corrects / grades well in post.

If I had it all to do over again, I would just buy the Lemming LUT from Germany b/c I think it nails an accurate image with higher dynamic range using Cinelike D. Hope this review helps",1470009600,,1663,4.60472972972973
8643803,5,B00IO2N3VE,"This guy starts at the beginning.  Most teachers assume the student already knows something and starts there.  No help.  I'll admit I haven't seen the whole video since we are in the middle of a big remodeling project.  But soon I can see the whole thing.  What I've seen so far is Easy five stars.  Planning to get his photoshop DVD as well.
If you know nothing about the camera and fee intimidated by it, I can tell you already this is foryou and he will take you far along the way to photography with your new Nikon 5300.",1463011200,2,524,4.242424242424242
