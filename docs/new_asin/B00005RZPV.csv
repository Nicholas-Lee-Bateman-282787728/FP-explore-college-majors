1658426,5,B00005RZPV,"Vandread is such a fun series to watch.  The setting, which sees women and men separated between two warring planets, is just great for hilarious scenarios and good gags.  The first season of Vandread (the first 13 episodes) stands very well by itself, and sets the stage for a great second season (which is currently running in Japan).  This first volume is a great introduction to a really fun series.",1007337600,4,403,4.728571428571429
1658427,4,B00005RZPV,"Naturally, you wouldn't expect anything bad from Gonzo especially as they are showing Vandread, Second Stage in Japan right now due to popular demand for this series.  From the opening theme, you will have an idea of what it looks like -- astonishing mecha-design merging into a more powerful mecha rendered in 3DCG.  Action-packed series plus loads of comedic fun.
I've actually written a full preview on this on my website animeokashi.com",1005782400,,440,5.097222222222222
1658428,5,B00005RZPV,"Easily one of the best Anime to date, japan or in the US. Great characters, awsome babes, kick butt CG and Cell animation, and one of the freshest stories in years, vandread is a must see for otaku alike!",1005091200,,204,4.256410256410256
1658429,5,B00005RZPV,"I saw the first episode of this series at the 2002 Anime Midatlantic Conference in Virginia.  I thought it was quite funny.  I have finally gottne hold of the entire first season and it has gotten funnier, but it also can rip your heart out.  This series really gets the audience into the characters and situations that they are in will move you to laughter or tears.  In the series, the men have the upper class who are pilots and officers and a lower class who builds the equipment for thier army.  You end up following a young boy from the lower group that gets stuck on a war ship and a girl training to be a warrior for the women.  The men and women see themselves as aliens, but you will learn that in the past they had lived together.  The series follows their journey to stop an alien race from killing off their race and their attempt to try to understand the opposit sex.  If you are looking for something with amazing computer animated mecha and that will make you laugh, I think you have found it.  Enjoy.  Keep the faith, dEx",1024617600,,1038,4.304123711340206
1658430,4,B00005RZPV,"Gonzo, the production company, did an excellent job on the animation. The sequences are smooth and the ""CG"" blends well with the ""standard"" animation.
The premise is simple: men think women are evil, women think men are barbarians and untrustworthy. It's like going back to when I was in school and thought girls carried weird diseases. The interaction resulting from this makes the episodes entertaining, if not always hilarious.
After watching the episodes a few times, it became clear that the characters are being developed. Each has a personal history that slowly reveals itself and makes the interactions between them understandable. I look forward to finding out more as the series continues.
The situations are not overtly sexual in this series, but the theme is adult in nature. (One viewing of the end credits should be enough to get the idea.)

My personal view:
If you're a mature viewer that enjoys anime with flying machines and somewhat adult humor, you'll probably like this series. I'd place this series in a similar line as Tenchi and Love Hina.",1024444800,5,1063,5.005649717514125
1658431,5,B00005RZPV,"THIS ANIME IS SOOO FUNNY IT WILL MAKE YA WANNA ...!!!!!!
I loved this anime from start to finish...and im guessin ur wonderin why its soo funny ne?
Its about a time when the males and females become seperate races and are at war with eachother.  The men start to interact with the women with interestin consequences ^.~
Alls i gots 2 say is its a great anime for any1 2 watch SOO BUY IT!!!!!!!!1",1024358400,,395,4.266666666666667
1658432,5,B00005RZPV,"I picked this up at a store because 1. I travelled all the way, and 2. I'm not leaving without buying SOMETHING.So, this looked cool. So i bought it. The storyline is unique. Its about 2 worlds, separated by gender. The males have the planet Tarak. Females have Mejale. Hibki Tokai, a 3rd class citizen on Tarak, tries to hijack a government fighter to prove to the rest of the factory workers that he keeps his word. He becomes a prisoner on a battleship after getting caught, when the women start attacking. I won't spoil anymore. The graphics are SPECTACULAR. The first time CG and Anime came together and it worked out. Sound is, ok. I haven't listened to the english dubbed yet. But it's worth buying.",1018828800,,706,4.566929133858268
1658433,4,B00005RZPV,"I like boy-meets-girl space themes with action and decent graphics, with slinky gals, occasional jiggling, people who aren't [bad], and this has them. I prefer anime where the genders mix and goofs happen and comedy occurs and sometimes there is heart break. The plot and story aren't necessarily new: Martian Successor Nadesico and a few other series have similar plot. There are pirates, transforming mecha, battles, glitzy affects, and so on just like others. But, it is told with enough original details to make it fresh (beleive me, I have watched a lot of shows, and a lot are pretty dull, so I won't say that without need).
Perfect? No. I am also looking for mature (not twisted nor peverted, just mature) themed anime along the lines of boy-and-girl-have-already-met-and-married-and-have-kiddies to get out of the kiddies in high-school level most are, but since most anime is intended for young kids and serial TV showing, I don't really complain that I don't find it. Series like these make the wait okay.
Nudity? Hmm, gotta look harder I guess. Haven't seen any real nudity in it. Maybe some of the reviewers haven't seen the show? (Or maybe they think of nudity as something other than really naked people?)",1018569600,6,1219,4.951219512195122
1658434,5,B00005RZPV,"For those of you who enjoyed Martian Successor Nadesico, think in terms of Akito like Hibiki the pilot who wanted to prove himself that he can pilot a mecha. Throw in an over hyper active female who has never met a male species before and watch as she meets Hibiki... then they chase each other around in a captiol spaceship that Hibiki snuck aboard to pilot a Vanguard... while an ambush of the female race that is dressed with alien battle uniform with highly technologically advanced weaponary is looking for her within this captiol ship... Hibiki who's called ""Mr. Alien"" by her soon finds out this female's name is Dita... though acknowledging his own history runs in sheer terror at the sight of this female... why? Well... check out this awesome Anime title and see for yourself!",1016668800,3,786,4.744525547445256
1658435,5,B00005RZPV,"my only complaint is that there are too few episodes released at a time. this is a wonderful series with great potential women vs men and yet both are faced with the fact that they need each other to survive! the cute humor and kiddie typepranks all play well - it gives the series a ligh hearted action tone, with interesting sexual tensions n conflicts.
well don't just sit there rentit; then buy it!

1658436,5,B00005RZPV,"When I heard it was made by the people who released 'Blue Sub 6', I had my doubts, but I bought it anyway.  And I do not regret it.  And this isn't some soft adorable anime (cough. pokemon, cough.), it contains alot of sex-based humor.  This anime is a comedic satire dealing with differences between men and women.
Outstanding Points:
1) Adorable / Innocent / Energetic / Cute Female Characters
2) Music Is Exellent.
3) Voices Exellent, English Voices O.K.
4) Animation Exellent
5) 3D scenes kinda cheesey (the Final Fantasy movie is probably to blame for that).
6) GENIUS! I've been waiting SO long for a multi-episode dvd/vhs that does NOT include previews for the following episodes (ie a preview for episode 2 after episode 1 even though there's 5 episodes or so on a dvd).  FINALLY!!!
Report Card:
Animation: A+
Vocal (sub): A

1658437,4,B00005RZPV,"At least in this first disc (containing the first 4 episodes), Vandread is not a serious science fiction/action show.  It's a blend of the Tenchi-style dynamic (boy surrounded by girls) with a Star Trek: Voyager premise (spaceship lost deep in unknown space).  To be fair, I'd prefer to rate this at 3.5 stars, as it has some problems.
First, the good points.  The show doesn't immediately fall prey to the standard plot device of every girl falls in love with the main guy.  In fact, the men and women are at war, and the male planet's propaganda films about women are hilarious.  There are also other guys in the mix, who liven things up a bit.  The sheer number of characters is impressive--almost all of them are female, and if you're watching the dub, I think every American voice actress had to be hired to cover all the roles.  The comedy, which ranges from slapstick to the culture/gender clash between the men and women, generally works.
Some things don't work well here.  First, the spaceships and fighing machines are all computer-generated, and these parts don't mesh well with the traditional animation of the characters.  It's better than, say Blue Sub No. 6 (made by the same studio), but still has a long way to go.  The ships generally don't even look good on their own--even Transformers: Beast Wars had better computer-generated images.  Second, the main male character, Hibiki, is quite pathetic--a born loser who works to keep himself that way.  When he is alone on-screen, the show falters.
But, on the whole, this is a worthwhile purchase.  The age rating Pioneer gives this is 13+, but I think I'd bump that up a bit.  The numerous female characters don't wear much in the way of clothing, and there is some sexual humor (but no sex).  If you like silliness and science fiction, you could do far worse than Vandread.",1011916800,,1840,4.724137931034483
1658438,5,B00005RZPV,"Vandread is an cool sci-fi anime, ""A Must Buy"". Excellent drawings and cool mecha design! If you like mechas, extreme fights and full speed. Then is Vandread for you.",1011830400,,166,4.758620689655173
7953034,5,B00005RZPV,"This anime isn't much different than some of the other space/harem/comedy stories out there. It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start.",1355184000,,848,4.66

7953037,3,B00005RZPV,"First the good. This is a technically beautiful anime. It has great special effects, high production values and a great musical score. Both the opening and closing themes are catchy and memorable. The setting itself is well known, so I won't bother delving into it, other then saying it allows for the innocence of romance to be explored as well as the exploration of homosexuality. But then herein lies the problem. Out of all the beautiful characters we are forced to focus mostly on the core ""love"" affair between Hibiki and Dita. The reason I put love in quotes is because Hibiki wants nothing to do with Dita, and Dita hangs on him like a jacket and refers only to him as ""Mr. Alien."" This is cute for the first few episodes, I guess, because of the rift that has existed so long between men and women you would expect there to be problems, especially between these two as they are only about 14. However, even after countless battles, numerous encounters, fights quarrels and revelations the two hardly get past even having a decent exchange of words without screaming at each other, and still not even using each other's names. I have a problem with characters who whine and scream throughout their screen time and that is basically all Hibiki does, as well as hurt Dita's feelings. Dita is cute, likeable, but just too silly and is always set up to have her feelings torn apart. The women seem more open to explore their sexuality with the men, then vice versa, but the time it takes for the two sexes to make progress even on the most base level is painful to watch at times. You would think they could learn to be cordial to each other seeing as how they constantly face mutual destruction at the hands of common enemy. Many of the other characters are far more interesting - such as Meia, Gascogne, Barnette, B.C., Rabat to name a few, and although they have their signature episodes where they are fleshed out more, the spotlight always quickly returns to Dita and Hibiki. I wish there were at least a couple of more male pilots with Vanguards, instead of just all of them fighting over a sawed off wimp like Hibiki. Sigh.",1146355200,,2134,4.5744125326370755
7953038,5,B00005RZPV,"I admit I was never a huge fan of anime shows.  But one dull night at home and nothing else to watch on tv changed all of that.  I couldn't find anything else to watch and I came across a few late night anime shows on Starz action channel.  I would usually watch for a while just to pass the time.  Until I saw Vandread.  It was already near the end of the first stage but the episodes I saw were amazing!  The story was interesting, with the women and men getting to know one another after years of being separated from the other and the 3D action was outstanding!  It totally blew me away.  Ever since then I watched the rest of the first stage and all of the second stage and it just kept getting better and better, I didn't want the series to end and I had to see how it all started so now I'm in the process of buying the series DVDs.

Unfortunately the DVDs don't really offer anything on them: all you get is a language choice (English & Japanese), English Subtitles, Scene Access, Promo videos, Design Gallery, Textless openings.  Plus four episodes: Boy meets girl, And...I lost my way, This is the path I choose to live, I want to know more about you.  Even though I love the episodes especially in letterbox version the DVD itself isn't worth twenty-six dollars.

But that's okay, I still want the entire series on DVD and will pay for it, the series is that good! LOL!  It also turned me on to watching other anime shows like Inuyasha, cowboy bebop, et al on the cartoon network and other late night starz action channel anime shows.  So I guess it opened up the world of Anime to me.",1095811200,9,1596,4.259136212624584
7953039,5,B00005RZPV,"I just have to say, anyone who loves anime should get this DVD, Vandread, is a cool, and best, anime series, it has everything, action, humor, drama, and romance. I especially like the drama and romance parts of Vandread, because those are the parts where it gets serious, and thats how I like anime series to be like. I still haven't gotten all the Vandread DVD's, but trust me, because of how much Vandread really kicks ass, Im going to get them all. Vandread Rules!",1093046400,2,468,4.517647058823529
7953040,4,B00005RZPV,"This series is hilarious!  After being seperated for 3 generations, men and women are coming together again for the first time, which leads to some unintentional humor on thier part(like the second time a Vandread is formed, and the aftermath.  I won't spoil it here, but it is too funny.)
The who whole thing is about discovering things about the opposite sex.  Lots of cool space battles, lots of humor.(Male Doctor ""She has a parasitic organism inside of her.""  Female navigator ""No, I pregnant!"")
All in all, a good series.",1058313600,4,527,4.822222222222222
7953041,5,B00005RZPV,"Just as with Gatekeepers and Blue Submarine No. 6, Gonzo has picked another winner of an anime. Gorgeous girls, cute guys, awe-inspiring machinery--and that's just the cast! The storyline is Boy Meets Girl with a definite twist that will be hard for the characters to completely overcome. The English dub is great--as a matter of fact, I PREFER it over the original Japanese. The original version is terrific as well, but there is just something about the English version that does the series justice. There is a good amount of action, but the focus of the story is really on how the characters interact with each other and their situation. Kudos to the makers of Vandread--my new favorite sci-fi series!",1043280000,4,704,4.875
7953042,5,B00005RZPV,"Vandread is `Lost In Space with a pich of Star Wars and Robotech (Macross)'.  An interplanetary war between men and women, which the women are declared `superior'.  The result of the most recent battle involves a male stowaway, a male doctor and a screwball helmsman who couldn't charm a fish... trapped on a ship commanded by women, soon to band together to battle a race who wants everybody different from them dead.  There's comedy, action (cool 3D effects), unintended romance (Hibiki... pursued by Dita.) and a lesson to be learned... again.",1029715200,2,546,4.978021978021978
