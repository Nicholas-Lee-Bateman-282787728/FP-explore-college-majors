8636848,3,B00HW959RG,"The documentary doesn't have a clear story line, and it doesn't seem to have an agenda.  It really just documents the mundane spartan life that they live, a lifestyle that is dying out.  In one scene the main character laments how the children go off to boarding school and don't have any interest in keeping up the tradition of being a nomadic reindeer herder, and prefer to live in towns.  With what you see from their life as presented in this DVD, you understand why the younger generation isn't interested in maintaining this culture.

For it's price, I don't regret purchasing it.  It's far from being one of my favorite DVDs, but it is a unique and low cost addition to my collection.",1494720000,,691,4.585365853658536
