4581492,3,B0055V0K90,"***Some plot points, no spoilers***

The movie opens with a murder during the cold of fall. A man wakes up from dozing off in his car. He gets out and opens the trunk and removes a bound and gagged woman. He apologizes for having nodded off, assures her everything is going to be alright and then kills her. Note when he gets out of the car, the door does not chime, i.e. keys are out of the ignition, but then when he gets back in it chimes, i.e. keys are somehow in the ignition. I hate it when a movie does this. Is this by design a clue or stupidity on the director's part?

We then move on. A dowdy looking blond (Amy Seimetz as Sarah) is at an AA meeting. She is 3 months sober. Some guy hits on her and they go out, and we discover that alcoholics are socially inept. Meanwhile the subplot continues with a prisoner looking like Zach Garifalakis (AJ Bowen as Garrick Turrell ) is being transferred in a police car under guard and carefully watched. Garrick espies a small screw rolling around on the floorboard.

Sarah is a nurse, who happens to be Garret's ex-girlfriend in hiding. Got the plot figured out yet?

But things aren't that simple. We find out that Sarah still masturbates (clothes on) while she thinks about Garrick. At her group she describes what she had was a ""bad relationship"" and that he was ""not honest"" with her. What was odd was that she took on some of the blame by claiming her drinking may have led to things being worse. We get flashbacks as the story progresses. Now Garret is on the road, leaving a trail of bodies behind him, killings he oddly appears to be remorseful about.

The mystery of the movie is what twist is this thing setting us up for? There are clues along the way as things don't fit. The car door chime wasn't one of them.

Clever? yes. Entertaining? Not really that powerful. The movie didn't feel like a slasher film. It felt more like a mystery or drama. The stabbings, wounds, and blood appeared realistic enough, which means bright red liquid doesn't squirt 3 feet into the air.

I also think they could have done better on the title.

4581493,4,B0055V0K90,"The serial killer genre has become quite stale.  Finally about time something comes along that isn't paint (with blood) by numbers fair.

Although some may find it a bit predictable it still won't take away from the overall effect.  From the acting, camera work and editing to the great music and sound effects, Horrible Way to Die is a top notch suspense film.  It could have used a bit more blood violence but that is just a minor detail.

Throw this and Henry Portrait of Serial Killer together for a great double feature.",1315526400,,525,4.602150537634409
4581494,5,B0055V0K90,"First let me say that right after watching this film I had to re watch it immediately it was that clever. The twist was a jaw dropper that I never saw coming.

A woman turns her 'serial killer' boyfriend in to the authorities after following him one night on one of his strange late night drives. When asked by her about them his response is 'you know I'm strange' as he leaves he tells her he loves her which he does a lot and in the time we get to see them together he seems nothing but wonderful towards her.

The main actress is amazing in her role, it's as if she is living it then and there and I was mesmerized by her performance.
She meets a very nice man at her AA meeting and tries to start a new life until her ex escapes from the authorities.

There are some very brutal scenes although not gratuitously so but still quite shocking and bloody.

The feel of the film is low budget but that doesn't take away from it's brilliance and impact.
I felt like the wind was knocked out of me when the twist occurred.
I highly recommend it for those that like these types of films and don't need major CGI or big special effects to appease them..",1315353600,,1148,4.180995475113122

4581498,2,B0055V0K90,"A Horrible Way to Die follows the story of two people: Garrick (A J Bowen), a prison inmate who manages to escape in a bloody way, and Sarah (Amy Seimetz), an Alcoholics Anonymous member who starts dating nice and handsome Kevin (Joe Swanberg). Using flashbacks and switching between two storylines, the film slowly reveals what happened between Garrick and Sarah in the past, and what will happen to them. Perhaps too slowly.

A Horrible Way to Die attempts to be both a twisty thriller and intelligent character study, and fails to become either. Despite the effective acting from the cast, the characters are not really interesting, and the story moves too slowly, especially in the first 60 minutes. When it gets finally interesting, it is almost over.

Some viewers would be interested in A Horrible Way to Die because it was directed by Adam Wingard, who went on to make a more critically and commercially successful film You're Next. However, Wingards tongue-in-cheek direction, which gives the latter its entertainment value, is missing in A Horrible Way to Die.

For the director goes straight for a more art-house approach, with shaky camera and blurred images. While the approach is sometimes effective in capturing the dark and bleak atmosphere surrounding characters, it is often overdone, making the already thin and sluggish story of A Horrible Way to Die even more boring.",1390521600,2,1388,5.0524017467248905
4581499,4,B0055V0K90,"I find it very sad that people nowadays cannot enjoy a well thought out thought-provoking indie film and instead spend their time watching repetitive, overdone, glamorized Hollywood flicks. This is not to say this movie is for everyone but it is much much better than 2.5 stars.

After watching this film and ""Pop Skull"" I believe Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett are quite the team. The scripting and plot are way out of mainstream and are extremely clever and original. I do not think everything is perfect about this movie (hence one star knock off). For example the title is terrible. Extremely misleading and unoriginal compared to the originality of the film. The film also isn't a gore fest or torture porn yet is wildly disturbing and surprisingly realistic. The directing, as said before is outstanding and contrary to other reviews the acting is believable. The thing that truly pulls this film down is not the directing or the scripting but the filming. The cinematography is terrible. It truly surprises me Wingard allowed it to be this way.

Go into this film with an open mind as, chances are, it isn't what you're expecting. This is a very good indie flick, enjoy it.",1376524800,2,1180,4.807881773399015
4581500,3,B0055V0K90,"I miss the old Adam Wingard.
When he first came onto the scene with ""Home Sick"" I was blown clean outta my socks, out the window, and onto my front porch.
A gory slasher that almost wandered around in a haze doing everything right.
His follow-up ""Pop Skull"" wandered around in the same dream-like stupor, but conversely accomplished very little.
In fact I would say it pretty much didn't do anything.
I was starting to get the suspicion that maybe Home Sick was a fluke.
Then he released ""A Horrible Way to Die"".
While it much more polished than his previous two entries, with deeper, more emotionally complex characters, it seemed like the haze had cleared;
like he was no longer as experimental as he once was.
It was like he had evolved into a different filmmaker entirely.
A more professional filmmaker.
Now while this may seem like a good thing, it almost felt like a betrayal.
Everything about his third feature length flick felt much more conventional.
Sure it had great, multi-layered characters, brought to life by a great cast;
AJ Bowen is especially making a name for himself in the indie horror scene.
It had a solid plot about a girl starting a new life, and her ex... who happens to be a serial killer tracking her down,
told in the chronologically chaotic fashion that has been all the rage since Pulp Fiction cemented itself into pop-cutlure.
But something was missing.
Well three things:
Charm.
It didn't have the charm of his previous flicks. The smoke had cleared, and the fiasco was visible.
Pacing.
It's slow, and wastes time on pointless scenes that don't serve any purpose other than to lengthen runtime, all while the camera zooms and pans like a coked-up jitterbug.
Entertainment.
It's dull.  Which is unforgivable.
Personally, I can overlook all of its other flaws so long as it was entertaining, and it just wasn't.
It's not without its merits, and might appeal to some who cling to the term ""slow burn"" like it's some kind of excuse, but it's not without its flaws.
Some might find it deep, and rich with characters whose story lines interweave creating a bloodstained tapestry.
But I ultimately just found it boring.
This might have been due to the script by Simon Barrett whose other flick ""Dead Birds"" I also found dull.
So I'll chalk it up to that, because deep down I still want to love Wingard, because Home Sick holds such a special place in my heart.
Even so I look forward to Wingard & Barrett's next collaboration ""You're Next, even if a little more tentatively than others.",1367971200,,2512,4.696145124716553
4581501,1,B0055V0K90,"The writer, Simon Barrett, wrote a commendable and very interesting story which the director/editor, Adam Windgard, completely butchered with the help of the photgraphers, Chris Hilleke and Mark Shalhorse.

The cut from one scene to the next over used black screens of varing lengths which made you feel like they were cutting to a commercial. The POV for many of the takes were ill chosen and lacked the kind of professional continuity expected for a filmm transferred to Blu-Ray.

The photographers probably never heard of a Steady-Cam as the screen bobbed continueslly up and down and from side to side. If they think this was a hip technique it was tried years ago and was amateurish then.

The acting was for the most part was excellent especially Amy Seimetz and A.J. Bowen both of which were convincing.

4581503,3,B0055V0K90,"A Horrible Way to Die (Adam Wingard, 2010)

Note: this movie was provided to me free of charge by Amazon Vine.

I started watching A Horrible Way to Die some time ago and got sidetracked; I only got back round to finishing it tonight, quite a while later (over a year later, if memory serves); because of this, I went back to the beginning and watched the entire thing again. It turns out that aside from a few flashes, I'd totally misremembered the bit I'd seen; I'm not sure whether that says more about the movie or me, but I found a great deal of it about as forgettable this time round. I've been a big fan of Adam Wingard's ever since I caught Home Sick, his first feature (viz. review 7Feb09). A Horrible Way to Die, Wingard's third feature, feels like an attempt to branch out. In that sense, it's an admirable thing. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it worked.

Plot: Garrick Turrell (The House of the Devil's AJ Bowen), a serial killer, seizes an opportunity and manages to escape from prison. He's on his way home  to his ex-girlfriend Sarah (Tiny Furniture's Amy Seimetz), now a recovering alcoholic trying to get on with her life, taking the first tentative steps toward romance with fellow ex-drunk Kevin (Kissing on the Mouth's Joe Swanberg). Unfortunately, Garrick popping up could certainly throw a monkeywrench into those plans...

The biggest problem with the movie is scriptwriter Simon Barrett (DeadBirds)'s attempt to tell the story in a fragmented, non-linear fashion. (He tries to keep the viewer grounded by changing Garrett's facial hair at the center of the fragmented time period; it does work, in a limited fashion, once you've seen the scene where Garrett shaves.) This isn't Memento; it's a genre horror film, big twist ending, naked dead bodies, gratuitous violence, and all, and it would have benefitted from simply being a genre horror film. It's not a terrible thing as is, but I got the feeling a number of times as I watched that a simple presentation would have become the material a great deal better than what we ended up with. ** ",1358553600,,2066,4.725
4581504,2,B0055V0K90,"The title kind of lends itself to the obvious digs:  horrible way to direct, horrible way to act, horrible way to shoot, etc.  The film actually wasn't that bad, but the camera work will surely go down as some of the most annoying in film history---the pervasive bobbing, weaving and out of focus shots all contribute to make movies like Cloverfield seem steady in comparison.  The story is simple.  Woman's testimony puts charismatic boyfriend serial killer away.  Serial killer escapes and returns to former girlfriend.  In the course of these events, woman picks up a pudgy-faced new boyfriend and tries to get on with her life.  The narrative is slow and often boring.  Many of the dialogues hardly move the plot along.  The climax is almost worth the wait, but one gets the feeling the whole film revolved around those last 5 or 10 minutes or so---and that everything else before it was padding and filler.  The serial killer, played by AJ Bowen, is about the only interesting character in the film.  Everyone else seems to be merely mouthing the lines.  It is in those moments when Bowen is on-screen, however, that the film almost seems to take on a creepy life of its own.  Not the greatest of thrillers, but it could have been a lot worse.",1345852800,,1248,4.669724770642202

She is attending AA meetings of coarse, as drinking is her only problem apparently, followed by the extensive long sounds of people snoring or stapling their eyes open in hopes this movie gets better. It doesn't. It's kind of like sitting in a waiting room where the atmosphere is that of an old library where no one speaks out of curtsy of the other patrons playing a game of who can die of boredom the quickest. Whilst in that room, the smell of stale mothballs mixed with the inch of dirt building up on the rotting old window ledge are suddenly distributed enough to blow into the middle of the room and catch some of that old afternoon sunshine leaking in through the old dark wooly drapes that must have been hung there when the place opened sometime in the late 1800's, oh how you wish someone would just drop a fart to bring the atmosphere of the room back to life... no one could care less about these details of the room, unless of coarse you're stuck waiting in it. That's the feeling this movie gets. Some might say it has a small bit of gore, but beleive me, no gore fans will be interested in this overly-long and under-produced snore-fest of an entertainment vibe killing monstrosity that is know as a horrible way to die. Even the Zack Galifinaks wannabe has fans too, and in the end when things make a little more sense, I would still demand that I want my money back, let alone the time wasted on seeing this dull, lifeless, no pace, no interesting twists or turns, no ... euhh... you get the point already. It needed just one fart in it to make me stay conscious and interested. But instead, it doesn't blow that way :(

Rent it, or better yet, d/l it if it sparks your curiosity, but I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever want to sit through this snore-fest of barely anything happening rubbish and purposely pop it back in the video player and press play intentionally to watch it one more time.

It may not be as bad as such movies as some movies I have reviewed before, but this one certainly takes the cake of being in the top 10 movies that when describing the movies plot in writing and hearing gore facts about the film, it sparks an interest, but then you actually see it for yourself, and couldn't be more disappointed with the results.",1345075200,,2480,4.400871459694989
4581506,2,B0055V0K90,"A Horrible Way To Die is a mediocre horror/thriller. It follows a recovering alcoholic and her serial-killer ex-boyfriend. It was decent and may have been a 3 star flick, but it's held back by some significant technical flaws.

What did I like? There were two scenes that made me say ""wow"". I enjoyed the twisted ending. And the music was great, although out of place at times. Acting was good, most of the time.

What did I dislike? This movie barely has any thrills or frights to be classified as a supposed horror/thriller. It felt a bit long, even with its already short length. The storytelling also jumps around a lot, and it can leave you slightly lost. It has very annoying transitions that are always blurry for several seconds. Also, the cameraman is constantly moving; every scene has the camera bouncing and swinging for no particular reason.

Overall, it was an okay movie. I do not recommend directly paying for this movie. As of 7/12/12, A Horrible Way To Die is available on Netflix Streaming, so stream it if you really want to watch it and save your money.

This movie has nudity and sex (not clearly seen because of the cameraman), and excessive blood and gore. (most of the violence is done off screen, we see mostly the aftermath.)",1342051200,4,1252,4.65158371040724

I won't give the story away, but the main protagonist is a woman with a troubled past, you can put the rest of the plot together, as it follows the conventions of that plot type. The antagonist and the rest of the cast all had student film quality performances; the protagonist was obviously the talent involved--her parts were played very well. I wouldn't run to see this horror-realism/suspense/psych thriller movie, but look for the main actress in well-made films in the future.",1339286400,,565,4.775510204081633
4581508,3,B0055V0K90,"Usually, at least in theory, photography doesn't make a film or make it great... but it sure as hell can ruin it.  First things first though.

I went into A Horrible Way to Die thinking it was going to be another torture porn film with enough blood and guts to make John Carpenter blush and Uwe Boll actually retire knowing he couldn't sink any lower.  Let's face it, it's next to impossible for horror filmmakers to create anything truly unique anymore as almost every horror film seems to give direct homage, whether intentional or not, to a predecessor or two.  Director Adam Wingard, with unforgettable(??) titles like Home Sick and Pop Skull, attempts something new by portraying an escaped serial killer tracking down his ex-girlfriend... who is also a recovering alcoholic.  Wingard depicts the serial killer sympathetically as even the character seems haunted and remorseful of his actions but... keeps on doing it anyway (Mr. Brooks, anyone?).

An interesting idea given we're force-fed nothing but over-the-top torture porn with no reason other than to satisfy a disgusting appetite for grotesque imagery.  In fact, the film seems to go out of its way to keep things pretty tame and power to Wingard for it.  You also get a certain sense of connection to the couple being trailed by the killer and hope nothing bad comes to them.

However, despite my praise to the story and screenplay, going back to the camerawork... it just ruined everything.  I have never felt so seasick in my life as the camerawork was so shakey that I literally had to ingest some Dramamine to keep my balance.  Realistic shots, like those from Paranormal Activity or Black Hawk Down are a nice touch, but too much can confuse the viewer if not make them sick.  The plot would literally pass me by because I was nauseated by the camera jumping about like a pinball.

The cameras were also constantly out of focus if not downright blurry.  Perhaps this was intention to keep the gore and violence level tame, but all it did was make an already nauseous audience more confused and sick.  It's almost as if the film took the bold move of NOT including the audience.  It ruined the movie.

All in all, Horrible Way to Die had great potential but was lost on really shoddy camerawork, whether intentional or not.  How the film festivals gave the film awards is beyond me.",1334707200,,2350,4.746305418719212

One thing that I didn't particularly like was that the film has a depressing quality.  I assume that since you're reading a review of an unreleased horror flick you've seen enough of the genre to have a sense of what I mean.  It's that scary/depressing mix that even stereotypically depressing outside-the-genre films like 21 grams, The Road, and Leaving Las Vegas don't come close to.  A bunch of web sites list The Mist as being depressing (and also a horror flick), but to me it seemed more infuriating than ""depressing,"" and that was only at the end.  Other examples of horror films that did this for me were Long Pig and Undocumented.  Despite this, though, the story was still great, and on a depressing-scale of 1-10 it was only a 4.  I highly recommend it.",1332288000,,1028,4.368421052631579

In the meantime she is trying to repair her life as a recovering alcoholic who meets up with another ex-drinker and eventually start dating. The serial killer eventually paves a path of dead bodies in search of the ex-girlfriend.

The title of the film, A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE, does not allude to much about the film, and certainly not what you get. It starts out with a girl being tortured, so you wonder if its another SAW or something to that effect. Thankfully, it is not, but as the story unfolds, its not any more satisfying. The acting is fair. It is not a high budget film, but this is not the issue. It is more how the story is put together. I found it to be a little ""patchwork"", which was a little frustrating. Moving from scene to scene appeared confusing and even some of the characters at first were undifferentiated, just in physical features.

The atmosphere of the film was generally gray which gave a dismal feeling throughout the film. Granted we are seeing a type of horror film, or at best, more of a thriller, however, it did not lend itself to a gritty sense or an eerie or scary mood. Instead it left it felt one-note throughout. The emotional component just was not there on any level, so interest in the characters were left at a distance. The characters themselves could have been developed a little more if to lift the film out of its darkness, but it never rises above that.

The name of the movie was ""A horrible way to die"", just listening to this title got me interested and made me want to watch the movie. I rented this movie and popped it in, within 20 minutes of the movie starting I found myself to be extreamly disinterested as well as disappointed. The reason I say this is because throughout the movie I found that the camera was shaking making it hard for one to pay attention to what is going on in the film, as well as the camera constantly going in and out of focus, again making it rather difficult to follow the story. The plot in this movie I felt was extreamly weak, which could be because the movie is low budget, even though the actors seem to do a decent job with their assigned roles. I do find it interesting that an escaped serial killer would come back for his ex girlfriend that was responsible for placing him behind bars, however what I don't understand is why he would save her in the end essentially allowing himself to die to save a woman who took his life away from him for taking the lives of other people. That is the only part of the movie that I found to be extreamly interesting, other than that the first hour of the movie was extreamly unworthly of my time.

The title alone has you interest right? Well I am sure it does because it had mine when I first heard about this. With a title like that how could you not like it right, well I can see how some would not. Still it had peeked my interest enough so that I wanted to give it a shot. After the viewing I was pleasantly surprised by how good this film was. It has problems of course but over all I liked it.

The movie is about Sarah and her ex Garrick, thing is her ex is a serial killer. So the film follows both with Sarah on her own and Garrick escaping from prison. The paths they take of course are very different. She is a recovering alcoholic trying to get over her past with him. He is still the same guy he was before and continues his killing spree, but it seems he does some how hate himself for doing all this. So while he is making his way back to her she is trying to forget about him. In doing so she meets a guy at the AA meetings and starts up a relationship with him. How will these parties come together?

I have to say that this film was really well written by producer Simon Barrett as all the characters were very believable. Director Adam Wingard did a good job with this film as the pace is slow but not enough to bore you. In fact I think that actually added to the character development in many ways. We get to know these people and may actually care about them by the end of it. I am actually looking forward to seeing his next flick ""Your Next"".

As I am sure you have heard or read by now that the only problem here is the camera work. Now I will say that it didn't bother me has much as it did others but it could have been better. I get what they were trying to go for here with the style, more of a realistic feel. The only thing is it seems that they over did it and annoyed some people. Sure I didn't care for all of the camera movements but over all I don't think it affected it that much.

Of course the acting here was good with every one being really believable, particularly AJ Bowen who played Garrick the killer. He next appears in the aforementioned ""Your Next"", but you may know him form ""The Signal, Creepshow 3, Hatchet 2"" among others. Also for all you gore hounds out there, this one isn't as bloody as one would think. Still the ending is great and makes this one worth your time.

If you do, good luck getting another date w/her as this is a pretty creepy movie and you don't want her to associate you with creepyness!  Much better to watch this one alone if you're so inclined to do so.  It contains enough misogyny to fill a dozen movies!

All in all, it's an OK flick.  Not great, not terrible.  Things are not always as they seem, and one could say that some subplot stuff is a little contrived.

Congratulations .. you just read about the movie in less than one minute !!

The acting was horrific ... very painful to watch all the longer I did.  The movie was 87 minutes and I paid attention to 15 minutes of it .. You are welcome for the breakdown as that saved 86 minutes of your life to do something better :)

The movie camera, for whatever reason or 'special effect' they were attempting to obtain, did not have image stabilization .. gave us headaches just trying to watch the stupid movie to figure out what was going on.

The beginning of the movie made me want to put hot needles in my own eyes ... boring ... lost interest within the first five minutes.  Came back every ten minutes or so since and didn't miss much.  I could not sit throughout the entire movie, it sucked that badly.

Then, I had the diarrhea, came back, and NOTHING happened in the movie during that time ... NOTHING.

The ending was the best part of the movie ... literally ... the ending.

That movie was 87 minutes of my time we will never get back....not to mention the money I spent on the piss-poor movie ... I should have save those bills for the diarrhea episode earlier.

I had not heard much of anything about the film, and it kept me on my toes.  The film switches back and forth in time; it takes a bit to figure out just where you are at times, the shifts are so abrupt.  The shaky-cam thing has been done to death and is more than a little annoying, making for a somewhat disjointed viewing experience.

The story is a slow burn, one that will take some time getting used to; this isn't your slam-bang Hollywood thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride.  I have to say though, the pace is worth it for the payoff.  The unpredictable final act comes out of nowhere and is pretty inspired.

The movie is about this woman who is an alcoholic. Her boyfriend is in jail, turns out he is a serial killer. The woman starts going to AA meetings for her alcohol problem. She meets this seemingly nice guy at one of her AA meetings and they start dating. At the start of the movie we get to see the serial killer- the old boyfriend- doing his thing to his victim. I have to say that the guy who played the serial killer wasn't bad, in fact he may have been the highlight of the movie, he did pretty good as far as acting is concerned and overall personality of a serial killer. The rest of the cast didn't impress me. It felt as though some of them were hired right off the street to act in this movie. They didn't capture my interest.

If I were to explain to you the whole plot of this movie and give away the ending you would probably say ""wow, that sounds good""- that's the problem- It sounds good but it isn't.

So, we find out the boyfriend serial killer has escaped from jail is looking for her and now the old girlfriend needs a place to hide. She goes with this AA meeting guy to a cabin in the woods to hide out and then bam... Twist in the story. The ending sounds good on paper but on the screen it just didn't work for me. It may have been the actors hired for the roles, all of them who couldn't pull it off and make this interesting. The serial killer boyfriend did Okay though. Disappointing uninteresting ending and ended too soon despite the whole movie being somewhat boring. As in, the whole movie was boring to a degree then the ending you're left wanting more explanation.

The female is controlling her drive, but with difficulty, but the male is unable to do so.

4581530,4,B0055V0K90,"I am not sure why but I expected so much less from this movie when I popped it in my DVD player.  I cannot explain why I had this bias, but I did.  I am very happy to say that this movie surprised me.  I found it to be very engaging, different, disturbing and (somewhat) believable.  In other words, I really liked it.

To summarize the plot, Sarah (Amy Seimetz) is recently sober and has been attending AA meetings for about four months.  Still waters run deep with Sarah and it is written over her face that there is emotional turbulence plaguing her life.  In her home group she meets Kevin (Joe Swanberg) and an awkward intimacy blooms between the two of them. Meanwhile, Garrick Turrell (AJ Bowen) is an extremely dangerous serial killer who has just escaped from prison and is on the run. As he eludes the authorities he begins killing again.  Garrick's goal is to go after Sarah; she is both his ex-girlfriend and the one who turned him in.

I do not want to minimize the plot, but this is basically the story.  I am not attempting to belittle the story, but it isn't very complex.  Notwithstanding, the manner in which the tale unfolds is what makes it unique. The narrative is interwoven; the present and former events are blended together.  A perfect example of this is Sarah working and then going to AA meeting morphs to her being at home with Garrick. The movie isn't very linear.  I actually find non-liner to be very refreshing, yet even I was befuddled at times. As for the violence, it is true dualism in the sense that it is subtle and graphic.  Some of the killings are left to the imagination and others are a splatter fest. This is a movie making ruse I haven't seen before and I welcomed it.

I felt the acting in this film was really good.  Amy Seimetz was very believable as the fragile woman with a damaged past.  Sarah was a low key character but I had an investment in what happened to her.  I have only seen AJ Bowen in ""House of the Devil"" (which was a great horror flick) but his performance in that film was a little one dimensional, good but one dimensional. In AHWTD Bowen's acting was very, very layered which gave his antagonist depth.

The pace of the movie is slow and at times it is like treacle dripping off a spoon.  Honestly, I didn't mind it because it gave the movie a ""character piece"" feel to it.  However, I could see how it could turn some viewers off.  There were a few scenes that I felt were a bit too winded.

Nevertheless, the one aspect that really keeps this film from being a five star movie is the cinematography.  There are more scenes that I can count where the camera goes out of focus for no apparent reason.  In addition there are scenes where characters are talking and the camera just wanders off, drops up, drops down or all of the above. I am not sure if the camera man was somebody's drunken uncle who begged for a job but it was very obnoxious. I am all for ""off the cuff"" camera work but it was ridiculous in this movie.

Yet what really seals the deal for this movie is the denouement, it blew me away. How the events all tied to together was marvelous and really set this movie apart from the mindless drones of modern horror cinema.  I would strongly recommend this movie for the horror fan who wants a little drama and a little intelligence with their blood.",1318464000,8,3330,4.3723577235772355
4581531,2,B0055V0K90,"If you read the synopsis of this movie and love thriller/horror movies you will get very excited but believe me the movie in no way matches up to its promise.  The premise is that a famed serial killer has escaped from police custody and he goes on a lengthy murder spree as he travels to get to his ex girlfriend.  She is a recovering alcoholic and it was her testimony that put him away.  The first mistake here is that she is obviously in protected custody and no one notifies her when her ex boyfriend escapes.  All the rest of the faults lie with director Adam Wingard and writer/producer Simon Barrett.  This movie plays out worse than any school class project could have.  There is no suspense, no thrills, no horror and the acting is all around terrible.  Plot is also minimal at best and there is no character development.  As we follow the killer on each murder the viewer feels nothing.  And the film has this weird way of going from past to present or from one character to another with flashing/fading lights and other transitional effects that get very irritating for there are some very short scenes.  It's a jumble of irritating nothingness.

The only saving grace to enduring 87 minutes of boredom is the surprise ending.  It is an OMG moment but in no way makes up for the unemotional ,ill made journey to get there.  I can't believe that there weren't better actors out there who would even have worked for free for the exposure who would have risen this terrible script a few notches.  But those people probably read it and knew to stay away.  The only other redeeming grace to this film is that it does show respect to the sanctity of NA and AA.  Other than that it is far below a grade B horror movie.  This is one of the rare times I've honestly said please beware of this film.  But believe me, all the negative reviews here are true.

Unfortunately, Sarah is plunged into a gruesome nightmare when Garrick escapes from prison  As the corpses of his murdered victims pile up in Ted Bundy fashion, she begins to fear for her safety.  Will Kevin be able to protect Sarah from Garrick?

  What a horrible shame.  ""A Horrible Way to Die"" had so much potential.  Unfortunately, the final product screamed, ""Amateur!"" and ""Low budget!""  The famous, groundbreaking ""Halloween"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Blu-ray/dp/B000UR9QHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween [Blu-ray</a>]) of the seventies was low budget but I never would have known if film critics hadn't informed me.  For a slasher/serial killer film, the plot for ""Horrible"" is inventive; gruesome killings, a high body count and a shocking ending make this movie highly marketable.  Unfortunately, poor casting, sloppy camera work, clich&eacute;d dialogue and subpar acting have harmed it considerably.

  A major hunk should've portrayed Garrick who had supposedly received marriage proposals in prison.  For example, the handsome Pavan Grover portrayed the sensual, seductive serial killer, Jesse Mowatt, of ""Unspeakable"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unspeakable/dp/B0002KPIFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unspeakable</a>).  When A. J. Bowen's character, Garrick, strips naked in preparation for transportation out of prison, I thought I would gag.  Joe Swanberg, on the other hand, had nice buttocks.  Appearing pretty and vulnerable, Amy Seimetz was appropriate for her role as Sarah.

  As far as film work/photography is concerned, vigorously shaking the camera during scene transitions only annoyed and irritated me.  Blurring the picture as though the camera is out of focus didn't work either.  The Christmas lights in the bedroom and at the AA meetings were inappropriate unless it was truly Christmas, which it wasn't.  On the other hand, the cold, snow environs emphasized and supported the film's chilling, depressing atmosphere.

  The only extra features on the DVD are a short ""making of"" featurette, approximately seven minutes long, titled ""Behind the Scenes of `A Horrible Way to Die'"" and ""Audio Commentary with Director/Editor Adam Wingard and Writer/Producer Simon Barrett.""  The making of featurette showed the filming of certain graphic, violent scenes such as the knife entering a man's open mouth via his throat.  However, no explanations are offered.  I didn't learn anything more about the plot by watching this short featurette; it merely teased me.

  The audio commentary was tasteless and redundant.  Most of the time, Wingard and Barrett cursed and complained about how difficult it was to make the film because they didn't have any money.  Most of the crew were used as extras.  The film was shot on location in the hometown of either Wingard or Barrett because they could beg people they knew to shoot at their businesses for free.  The Christmas lights, I learned, were used because the art budget was nil.  All the audio commentary accomplished was to confirm what I had already suspected: the production costs were virtually nonexistent.

  There are not any trailers, deleted scenes, alternate endings, bloopers, etc.  There are, however, Spanish subtitles and English subtitles for those of us, like myself, who are hearing impaired.  The aspect ratio is 1.78:1 and has been formatted for a widescreen television.  I'm surprised that Anchor Bay didn't give ""Horrible"" a better release on DVD.  They once had a reputation for releasing only the best in high quality contemporary and classic horror.  Unfortunately, they now seem to print most anything, even if it's a homemade film made by amateurs.

  ""A Horrible Way to Die"" would have been a tense, psychological horror thriller if the direction, camera work and acting had been more professional.  Unfortunately, it never rises above the mire of mediocrity.  Slasher fans will want to watch this film for the shocking ending; however, I strongly recommend that it be rented.  I thought Anchor Bay's recent release of ""Bereavement"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bereavement-Blu-ray/dp/B0051ZIXNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bereavement [Blu-ray</a>]) was so much more entertaining and professional than ""Horrible.""

To try to put us in a scary, disoriented mood, the camera(which is mostly hand held) is deliberately shaken in pretty much every scene, with the exception of shots that require a mounted camera, like the driving scenes. All that does is annoy us, not scare us. The story is also poorly told, using actors that look alike to make it even harder to follow the story. It was not even clear that the story progressed in normal time, or was it presented with lots of flashbacks? Things clear up a bit in the final scene(half of which is shot upside down to annoy us further). Some dialog doesn't make sense, like two doctor's nurses discussing a date night in front of a patient. I gave this movie one extra star because there was some talent involved and it was not their fault, like the actors, and technical staff(even the camera work would be OK if they were instructed not to shake the camera).

When I originally heard about this movie I was expecting something that spanned both of those genres. Granted I didn't expect it to be in the same ballpark as those movies as it was a straight to DVD release.

What i got however, is an amatuer-ish attempt at crossing those lines. The plot of this movie has the same pace as a movie about a flesh eating glacier. And, about the same excitement too. Some of the videography was well done, but that was hit and miss. There are a couple scnese that - because of how they were filmed - make little to no sense.

The movie comes in at around an hour and a half. But for the first hour and ten minutes you will be looking around the room to try and find something to create your own horror movie with and possibly stab your eyes so you don't have to watch.

Of course being that this is a thriller/horror movie there is a dramatic twist at the end. But, if you passed the 5th grade and have watched movies in the past you'll know what it is.

In the end, for me, it was a disappointing movie and not an overly pleasurable experience.",1317427200,,1270,4.360169491525424
4581539,3,B0055V0K90,"This movie seems like it was made by someone that was raised watching the same horror/slasher movies that I did,films made by the same horror masters of the 70's.

The film is 85 minutes long and I guess the first 70 minutes are supposed to be taut & pensive and I could sit through that time because the film looks good and I liked the acting of Amy Seimetz and thought Joe Swanberg was ok, but overall with the payoff it didn't really grab me,

Now here's the part that might surprise some readers,I have a feeling that the second viewing of this might be better,which is saying a lot because tons of movies once is enough but I enjoyed it enough to wait a few weeks and try it again.

The film is rated R for some nudity and violence.

The film has an English soundtrack and offers English and Spanish subtitles.

The DVD offers a behind the movie scenes short and a audio commentary by the Director and Producer/Writer.

This film is not a total success but because of the way it's made the filmmakers show promise.

4581540,1,B0055V0K90,"This is a senseless, gory film about a serial killer who escapes from prison and continues to slash and kill on his way to find his former girlfriend who turned him into the FBI.  She is supposed to be in some sort of witness protection program (witless protection) and joins an AA group to get sober. In the program she meets a charmingly supportive fellow AA member who is an inept sexual partner (premature ejaculation). This serial killer has thousands of ""fans"" and copycat killers (sickos). The story line is predictable and the camera work nauseating. The camera work reminds me of my parents attempts to catch family events on their old 8mm camera and heads are cut off and things go in and out of focus. This is not my idea of entertainment or good film-making. It is an amateurish bit of horror claptrap. If you get the sense that I didn't like this film, you are on the money.",1317340800,2,887,4.509316770186335
4581541,4,B0055V0K90,"""A Horrible Way To Die"" is no slasher movie. This film does not rely on gore, cheap scares, or boogeymen. Rather, this is a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Portrait-of-a-Serial-Killer/dp/6305191883/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>--more like the former than the latter.

Garrick Turrell is a famous serial killer, the darling of the Internet and twisted admirers across the country. He has escaped from custody and is on the trail of his former girlfriend, Sarah, a recovering alcoholic trying to reclaim a normal life. Numerous bodies litter the landscape as he tracks her down, but these are generally shot in an understated way, neither glorified nor horrifying (in the sense of shocking to the audience). Indeed, this film struck me as almost a character study of two people who just happen to be a serial killer and his ex. At the same time, there is indeed a heck of a twist at the end that the film builds up to all along.

My reference to Blair Witch refers to the camerawork. Throughout the film, handheld cameras, shaking, and blurring occur frequently. While they are not to the degree of the same in, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>, they are certainly noticeable. Sometimes they work, but most of the time I found them moderately annoying--but not enough so to overwhelm the rest of the film.",1317168000,,1695,6.462555066079295

  I was disappointed in this movie. It is slow moving and pretty boring until the last 10 minutes. I don't know how it stunned  festival audiences unless they were stunned into boredom. I have to admit the ending was interesting.
  The serial killer Garrick Turrell was the most polite serial killer I have ever seen in a movie.
I thought the acting was well done. I didn't know if some of the weird scene shots (shaky movement and out of focus shots),were to enhance the movie but all it did was annoy me. There isn't even much dialogue throughout the movie. The scenes are before and after Garrick's arrest and from Garrick and his ex girlfriend Sarah's point of view. The only best part of the movie is the last ten minutes or so. At this point it moves pretty fast and it is a surprise ending. I wouldn't pay to buy this movie and I would only rent it if there isn't anything else. If you want to see horrible, cool ways to die try renting Chain Letter.",1317168000,3,980,4.298913043478261
4581543,3,B0055V0K90,"There are things I like about this movie.  The acting is good.  The story is fairly original.  I'm giving it a lot of points for being an original story.  Those are hard to find these days. Almost everything made these days in movies and tv has been done over and over again already.  This story is something I haven't seen before.  Sure, there are plenty of movies about serial killers, but not that many about the serial killer's girlfriend - and that's what this one is about.  She is the star of the movie.  All of the guys, including her boyfriend, are basically her supporting actors.  OK, now we come to one of the things I didn't like.  Her acting was really good for most of the movie, but there are a couple of scenes - and maybe this wasn't her fault (could have been bad editing or bad recording) where she was talking and I couldn't understand a word she was saying.  It was obvious she was upset, so I got that anyway.  However, it would have been nice to hear what she was actually saying at the time.  The OTHER thing I really did NOT like, and this is why I knocked at least one star off of the rating, is the ""Blair Witch"" shaky cam work.  That has been so overused since that movie, I can't describe how much I can't stand it, but ESPECIALLY when it's as overdone as it is in this movie.  Sometimes the camera is shaking so much that you really can't tell what's happening.  There have been movies like ""Cloverfield"", for instance, that have used the same effect, but do it much less blatently and therefore, much more effectively.  So, my bottom line on this film is that it has a really good script with a fairly original story; but the technical aspects of the film, in terms of the audio and the visuals really distract from the story rather than adding to it (as I'm sure the film-makers had intended).",1317168000,,1826,4.339233038348082
4581544,2,B0055V0K90,"Yo I'mma keep this short and to the point. This movie was in no way better than The Matrix. Regardless of if anyone's said that it was or not, this movie fails to deliver in a lot of ways. First off, they don't tell you what the horrible way to die is. You have to use your imagination and make up your own mind to figure out what it is. I hate it when directors leave something open for interpretation, and this is another one of those cases. It's like how The Shawshank Redepmtion is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz but just with more drama thrown in.

The graphics in this movie were ok, so i'll give it an extra star. They were almost as good as God of War 3's.",1317168000,,667,4.015037593984962

8458855,3,B0055V0K90,"The Amazon plot summary for this movie gives away way too much information.  In any case, this is grim and depressing but undeniably effective horror drama about a serial killer who escapes police custody and leaves a trail of bodies in his wake while he travels across the country and a cagey waitress with a past she won't talk about whom we assume will eventually become one of his victims.

The serial killer is very different from the kind normally depicted in movies because he doesn't enjoy killing--in fact, it actually makes him miserable--but he has a compulsion to do it that he can't control.  A Horrible Way To Die takes the same approach to violence that Wes Craven attempted with The Last House on the Left and actually pulled off with The Hills Have Eyes--to make the violence seem genuinely real and consequential.

A Horrible Way To Die is clever enough to not go where you think it's going but it's also too much of a morose downer to provide any actual entertainment.  Reportedly writer Simon Barrett and director Adam Wingard weren't thrilled that people were so visibly bummed out leaving the theater after seeing their film so they took exactly the opposite approach with their next movie, You're Next, which is also a violent horror film but one that was specifically designed to be an audience pleaser.  Ultimately, the best thing about A Horrible Way To Die is that it directly inspired the creation of You're Next, which is easily one of my favorite horror films from the past twenty years.

If you like your horror grim, downbeat and realistic then A Horrible Way To Die is definitely for you.  But if you want to be entertained it's a pretty horrible way to spend your time.",1498694400,,1703,4.691275167785235
