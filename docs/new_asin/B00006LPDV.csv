1786258,3,B00006LPDV,"Where Brides of Blood (1968) was the first of the Blood Island trilogy of films, Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968) was the most popular, and this one, the third and final feature in the series titled Beast of Blood (1971) was actually the most successful, appearing in more venues and drawing in larger audiences due to the popularity of the previous two films.  Produced, co-written, and directed by Eddie Romero (Mad Doctor of Blood Island, Brides of Blood, Beast of the Yellow Night), the film features John Ashley (High School Caesar, Muscle Beach Party, Hell On Wheels) and Celeste Yarnall (The Face of Eve, The Velvet Vampire).  Also appearing is Eddie Garcia (Black Mamba, Sudden Death), Bruno Punzalan (Mad Doctor of Blood Island), and Beverly Miller (Beast of the Yellow Night), who also provided the story (a rather lame one at that, I might add).

Picking up directly where Mad Doctor of Blood Island left off we see Dr. Bill Foster (Ashley) on a ship heading away from Blood Island, but things go awry as the fungus man/beast with green blood and homicidal tendencies, who stowed away on the ship prior to its leaving, goes insane in the membrane (insane in the brain!), killing a number of crewmen with an axe before causing a fire that ultimately destroys the vessel.  Both Bill and the creature escape, the former knocked unconscious and later rescued while the latter returns to the island, slightly crispier from the fire and soggier from the water.  Sometime afterward we see Bill returning to the island (God knows why), along with a plucky reporter named Myra Russell (Yarnall) who's just itching to get the scoop on the not so groovy happenings on the island.  The natives don't seem all that happy to see Bill, probably due to the fact that whenever he shows up, things tend to go down the tubes.  If'n it were up to me, I'd probably kill his tainted ash and be done with it, but whatever...another thing I've noticed...there aren't as many attractive native women around as there was previously, probably due to the fact a good number of them were either killed of sacrificed in the past.  Well, at least there is one that stands out, a slightly pudgy, scantily clad woman named Laida, whom I'm sure Ashley's character will get an opportunity to bag later on...anyway, events lead up to Bill discovering Dr. Lorca, played by Eddie Garcia here, along with his bald. Mute, machete-wielding manservant Razak (Punzalan), managed to survive the last film (a little worse for wear in Lorca's case as besides a limp, he now sports an eye patch and the entire left side of his face had been melted).  Not only that, but he's been continuing his `green blood' experiments in a secret laboratory set in the mountains, having captured the fungus man after it washed up on the beach.  Poor fungus man...not only is he singed and subsequently quite a bit funkier than before, but now Lorca has gone off and removed his head, keeping both parts alive while conducting vile and nasty experiments on various prisoners.  Eventually Lorca kidnaps Myra, Bill mounts a rescue, yadda, yadda, yadda...

It's interesting as in the previous two Blood Island films, there wasn't so much an actual story, but a series of loosely connected events leading up to climatic finales.  In Beast of Blood, there is a bit more of a structured story, so it's a little easier to follow, but the downside is so little actually happens.  The film opens with a bang, followed by an excessive amount of tedium, capped off with decent ending.  Seriously, so much time is spent watching the main characters traipsing around the jungle doing a whole lot of nothing.  I was disappointed how little creature action there was in this movie, compared to the previous films...the main monster, who actually looks decent compared to the previous film, spends most of its time with its head on a tray and its body on a gurney, connected to an assortment of electronic gizmos (as I mentioned earlier, Lorca removed the head and managed to keep the separate parts alive).  The creature make-up looks a bit more sophisticated than in the previous films, indicating perhaps a slightly larger budget was allocated, but, like I said, there's not much creature action, so it all felt a little pointless.  You know what's really funny to me in these films is how Ashley, a poor man's Elvis (besides an actor, Ashley was also a rockabilly singer) was portrayed.  Ashley was a modestly handsome man, I'll give him that, but if you were to believe the characters in these films you'd think no creature, woman nor beast, with a pair of ovaries was able to resist Ashley's manly charms, oozing machismo, mutton chop sideburns, and duck tailed hairdo ala Fonzie from the sitcom ""Happy Days"".  Seriously, in each one of these movies he's got like at least two women throwing themselves at him, begging to be shagged by this 1950s throwback.  Oddly enough, Bill declines to get it on with the busty native woman Laida (he probably saw how handy she was with a knife), but does manage to pull it together to put it to Myra (Ms. Yarnall had quite the attractive figure, and we do get to see a bit of it during the shagging aka bungle in the jungle sequence).  As far as the gore content, there is some spurting blood as we see one hapless schmuck get tossed into a tiger trap (a hole covered in leaves, the bottom populated by sharpened, wooden stakes), while another gets riddled in the chest by a machine gunner with a twitchy finger (Lorca's mercenary army was less than capable).  In another sequence we actually see Lorca in an operating room, cutting (more like hacking) into the flesh of something with a scalpel (it was meant to be a human, but I suspect it was a deceased goat).  While entertaining, I just didn't get the overall sense of filthy fun I had gotten from the previous films.  The potential was here (I liked the headless fungus man bits), but sans the sleaze this comes off as just another jungle adventure flick with the occasional appearance of a monster.

The restored picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1) format, on this Image Entertainment release looks very good.  It does show signs of aging (some lines, white specking, etc.).  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very well.  As far as extras included, there's a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an interview w/ Celeste Yarnell conducted by Sam Sherman, a `lost' opening sequence, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, a Beast of Blood essay by Christopher William Koenig, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Brain of Blood (1972), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), Raiders of the Living Dead (1986), and Horror of the Blood Monster (1970).

By the way, if you're interesting in getting this DVD release, I'd suggest trying to find the four DVD set titled The Blood Island Vacation, released by Image Entertainment, which includes the following...Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), and Brain of Blood (1972).  It appears significantly less expensive than buying the titles separately.",1149552000,6,7307,4.806863527533919
1786259,5,B00006LPDV,"This is a great movie.  It has everything:

pretty girls
tropical jungle setting
mad scientist
monster

What more can you ask for ?

John Ashley is starting to become one of my favorite actors.  He looks like Elvis.

I didn't view the interview with the director.

Highly recommended.

1786260,2,B00006LPDV,"I first saw Eddie Romero's Filipino horror film ""Beast of Blood"" on TV, on a local station's late-night ""Creature Feature"" when I was in high school in the 1970s.  The film was lots of fun -- if a bit cheesy in places -- and it stayed in my memory for 30 years or more.  It did so for one reason: the saronged, machete-slashing character of Laida, played by Liza Belmonte.  Because the movie inhabited my brain for so long -- and was embellished by my imagination as it did -- I've recently sought it out on DVD.  Having now seen ""Beast of Blood"" again, I'd like to write something about it.  Only I'm not sure if I want to write about the film that actually exists or the film as I remember it.

Although I can recall watching the TV shows ""Honey West"" and ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" in the 1960s, I can't recall any images of female heroism from them.  ""Beast of Blood's"" blade-flashing Laida was the first time I remember seeing a woman struggling against the bad guys as an equal with the male heroes.  She wasn't just a damsel-in-distress allowed a single act of heroic agency (a role filled in ""Beast of Blood"" by Celeste Yarnall's Myra Russell).  Instead, she was a woman warrior who stood shoulder to shoulder with her male comrades and who went into battle as unblinkingly as they did.  As a teenager in the mid-1970s, I had never seen a character like this before.

I don't remember if it was because my local TV station had cut out her introductory scene or because I missed the beginning of the movie, but Laida seemed to come out of nowhere in the story.  The purported hero of the movie, John Ashley's Bill Foster, is chasing one of the monsters through the jungle, when Laida steps out from behind the trees and slashes the baddie to bits.  ""Whoa,"" I remember thinking to myself, ""where did she come from?""  Laida riveted my attention for the rest of the film, as she totally overshadowed both Ashley and Yarnall.  By the end of the movie, Laida was the most heroic character, dispatching the majority of the arch-villain's henchmen and freeing his prisoners.

Now that I've seen ""Beast of Blood"" again for the first time in 30 years, I realize just how different my memory of the movie has been from the movie itself.  I remembered Laida as being a much more lithe figure, when in fact she's rather non-athletic.  I remembered her dynamically leaping out of the jungle, when in fact her body movement is quite minimal for an action hero.  I remembered her as being more fluent in English, when in fact Liza Belmonte seems to struggle with the language almost as much as Laida struggles with the bad guys.  My mind had also blocked out that stupid floral lei that she wears around her neck in every scene.  But the character still held my attention.  She still easily outshone the two romantic leads, Ashley and Yarnall.  Indeed, I was puzzled why the character wasn't called by a name at all during the film (I got the name ""Laida"" from a cast listing of the movie on another Internet site).

Needless to say, when I first saw ""Beast of Blood,"" the TV station cut out its nudity, thus excising Laida's unsuccessful seduction of Foster.  (In fact, there's more nudity in ""Beast of Blood"" than you would expect from a film rated PG.)  This explained a later scene, where Foster tells Laida why he couldn't make love to her, a scene which seemed to come out of the blue without its censored set-up.  But by putting Laida in the role -- however momentarily -- of Foster's love interest, ""Beast of Blood"" seems to be trying to rein in her hard-to-control female energy, and the scene seems forced.  Strangely, Laida isn't a character in the film to which ""Beast of Blood"" is a sequel, 1969's ""Mad Doctor of Blood Island.""

I suppose that unflinching, no-nonsense heroines like Laida have become commonplace by now, from the vampire-slaying Buffy to Uma Thurman's Bride to super assassin Mrs. Smith: heroines who show off as much butt as they kick.  But I hold a special place in my personal pop-culture pantheon for the woman who beat them to the punch (or at least to the machete slice).  And I'm a little bewildered why more commentaries about ""Beast of Blood"" give the character such short shrift.  In fact, I think it would be a terrific idea to make an action film today with a Laida-like character as its central heroine: a stoic-faced, blade-wielding, sarong-clad, cinnamon-skinned goddess of the jungle.  Only this time around, the character could be played by a more athletic actress and given flashier fight choreography.  And she wouldn't need a John Ashley to help her defeat the bad guys.",1126051200,2,4612,4.604651162790698
1786261,3,B00006LPDV,"This no-budget wonder from Eddie Romero (The Orson Welles of the Phillipine Islands) and Hemisphere studios is a great throwback to the Drive-In era.  'Beast' is the third entry in the 'Blood Island' series (fourth if you count 'Terror is a Man').  This one has a well concieved monster, surprisingly gory kills (for its' day), 'mondo' jungle ambience, silly sub-Bond intrigue and yes, even some topless babes going for it.  The DVD has some nice extras, but I do have some complaints.  First, the print used for this DVD transfer is hurting.  They claim it's been restored, but I just can't believe it.  This thing's riddled with scratches and artifacting and is so dark in places, it's hard to make out what's going on.  Also the commentary by the producer is a real snoozer.  He goes on and on about the minutae of Hemisphere's history and repeats himself endlessly, not really giving much insight into the making of 'Beast'.  That said, I got the impression that Image really was trying to do the best they could with this DVD and that's more than can be said of most genre DVD releases.  Even with the drawbacks, this disk is a welcome addition to any schlock-fiend's library and I especially enjoyed the interview with Romero.",1072915200,4,1232,4.741784037558685
1786262,1,B00006LPDV,"Another entry in the Blood Island films, this one opens with a fanged monster bursting out of hiding on a cargo ship parked off the coast of Blood Island. The beast grabs an axe and slaughters the crew before the ship explodes in the melee. The sole human survivor, John Ashley, washes ashore as does the monster who ambles off into the jungle. Ashley determines to find and kill the beast but first he must locate the evil Dr. Lorca whose experiments in his island hideaway resulted in the beast as well as some murderous mutated natives. Intrepid reporter Celeste Yarnall comes along to get the scoop. She is kidnapped by Lorcas' henchmen and taken to the hideaway house. A chubby local native girl takes a shine to Ashley and helps him battle the henchmen through most of the middle of the film in the jungle. The beast doesn't show up again until the end when it's revealed Dr. Lorca is looking to give it a new head. Not as fun as ""Brides of Blood"" although there is a bit more gore and some topless shots of Yarnall and the chubby native girl. The photography is good to poor with some scenes tinted so dark it's hard to make out what's going on. Ashley is wooden as always and Yarnall is not much better but she is fetching in a sarong. I can only say see this if you're curious but there's not much ""Beast of the Dead"". Instead there's too much jungle action between Ashley and the henchmen.",1039478400,3,1399,4.405405405405405

1786303,5,B00006LPDV,"WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS: This is the final film in the ""Blood Island Trilogy"", which began with BRIDES OF BLOOD (1968; which had its own self-contained story) and then continued on with MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND (1968/1969) , which this film concludes the story to. If you read my review of MAD DOCTOR, you would know that as Dr. Bill Foster (John Ashley, who did more for Filipino cinema in the 70's besides Roger Corman), Sheila and Carlos (both who are not seen in this film) are leaving Blood Island, there was a little surprise in the life boat of their ship. BEAST OF BLOOD (also known as BLOOD DEVILS and THE BEAST OF THE DEAD) picks up immediately where MAD DOCTOR left off. The chlorophyll monster (who is actually Carlos' mutated father) pops up out of the life boat with an axe and begins to chop up the crew (I must remind you, this was a PG-Rated film, but there is nothing in the gore and nudity department that is held back) and then throws a drum of flammable liquid at the crew from an upper deck. After slaughtering a few more of the crew (including a stupid one who is holding a torch right next to the leaking flammable liquid), the boat catches on fire and explodes. Bill calls out Sheila's name a couple of times and is blown overboard, he being the only survivor. Well, he's the only human survivor. The chlorophyll monster washes ashore and runs through the jungle as the opening titles appear. Six months later, as Bill has been rescued by the natives of Blood Island and he goes back to the mainland, he decides to make the trip back to Blood Island, because he hears that Dr. Lorca (Eddie Garcia; BAMBOO GODS AND IRON MEN - 1974; he replaces Ronald Remy in the role from the previous film; this time he wears an eyepatch and one side of his face is burned) and his brutal right-hand man, Razak (Bruno Punzalan, who returns from the second film), have survived the explosion of their cave lab on top of a waterfalls and are still experimenting on the natives. Bill wants to stop Dr. Lorca and his experiments once and for all.  Also on the ship to Blood Island is reknown photographer/reporter M.J. Russell (Celeste Yarnall; THE VELVET VAMPIRE - 1971), who has been assigned by her magazine (kind of like The National Enquirer) to do a photo essay and article on Bill's exploits. Bill doesn't like the idea at all, but you know Bill: There hasn't been a woman he hasn't taken to bed. Right now, Bill has nothing but vengeance on his mind, due to Sheila's murder and Dr. Lorca using the natives as his own experimental subjects. If M.J. wants to find out what is going on at Blood Island, she is going to have to find out for herself. When they get to Blood Island, Bill notices that the village has moved, but the Captain (Beverly Miller, who is a man in case you were wondering) said the village probably moved because the fishing was better, but Bill knows that is a bulls*** excuse. The natives are scared of Bill because ""the evil one touched you"" and many villagers are missing, including beautiful native girl Laida's (Liza Belmonte) father, who she blames on Bill (When M.J. tries to take her photo, Laida slaps the camera away and tells M.J. if she wants her photo, to ask first). Laida also blames Bill for the village moving, because the land it use to be on is now cursed. Bill talks to old friend, village elder Ramu (Alphonso Carvajal, who returns from the  film). Ramu, who is not too pleased with Bill, tells him that the ""green people"" are still roaming the jungle and kidnapping or murdering their residents. That night, someone pulls the wire from the generator and the electricity goes out. Bill (who is never without a pistol) checks out the generator and M.J. is nearly killed by a green man, but Laida kills him with a machete. The following morning, Bill, M.J., Laida, the Captain, Ramu and a handful of natives (who are willing to work with Bill) scour the island looking for Dr. Lorca, who everyone on the island thinks is dead because he hasn't been seen since the explosion at the cave six months earlier. They do find a camoflaged tunnel, but before Bill can find the triggering mechanism to open it, they find a building full of rotting native corpses and M.J. falls through a trap door and comes face-to-face with a cobra. Bill kills the cobra with his pistol and rescues M.J.. With the help of Laida and some natives, they keep an eye on the late Mrs. Lopez's mansion (read my review of MAD DOCTOR) that night because Bill believes Dr. Lorca is still alive and secretly living there. Bill and Laida see a light shining in one of the windows and when they go to the room, they find a severed human head on a table and Razak lurking around. Bill and Laida chase Razak, when Ramu appears and tells Bill that M.J. has been kidnapped. Bill thinks the hidden tunnel is the key, so he finds the hidden mechanism to open it and they all go inside (it is actually a huge underground cavern). It leads to an outside camp on the other side of the island, which is patrolled by Dr. Lorca's guards and Razak is leading them. They spot M.J. in the camp, but there are too many guards and not enough weapons to save M.J. Bill comes up with a plan: He will follow the guards and M.J. alone, while Ramu and his group (and any additional natives he can talk into coming with him) will go back to the Captain's ship and get all the automatic weapons aboard. Bill will leave a trail the group can follow once they come back. Laida insists that she goes with Bill and this is one lady you don't say ""No!"" to. Razak leads his group and M.J. deeper into the jungle, with Bill and Laida following them close behind. They set up camp for the night, where one of the guards tries to rape M.J. (lots of naked breasts in this sequence), but Razak puts a gun to his head and threatens to blow it off if he goes any further (I guess even evil right-hand men have their limits). All this happens after M.J. manages to break free from the ropes tied around her hands and she runs right into a dead native tied spead-eagle between two trees and screams (letting the guards know she has escaped) and then runs and falls into a pit of quicksand! (""M.J."" probably stands for ""Major Jerk""). Bill and Laida still manage to keep close tabs on M.J. and Bill discovers the waterfalls from the previous film, so he knows where Dr. Lorca is hiding. Bill and Laida settle down for the night and Laida wants to make love with Bill (more female bare breasts), but Bill is still hurting over Sheila's death and can't go through with it. Laida, a normally tough woman, actually understands. We then switch to Dr. Lorca and find out why the chlorophyll monster hasn't been attacking natives for the past six months: Dr. Lorca has actually removed the chlorophyll monster's head and tries to transplant native heads on the monster's body, while the head of the monster watches. Dr. Lorca knows that the monster's head can talk, but it never says anything to him. We watch one particularly disgusting scene of Dr. Lorca removing a native's head from his body (I'm not even certain the MPAA would let this get by with an R-Rating today without some edits) and try to transplant it on the monster's body, but the transplant fails. As Dr. Lorca and Razak leave the room, we hear the head of the monster say, ""The day may come soon, Lorca!"" Bill suddenly decides that he will surrender to Dr. Lorca, thinking Lorca will not kill him (the logic here is just mind-numbing!) and to get his attention, he throws a guard into a pit full of spikes (more footage that would never be shown in a PG-Rated film today) and the guard that tried to rape M.J. accidentally shoots and kills one of his own men thinking it is Bill (we watch as the blood from his gunshot wounds spurt blood, while he spits blood out of his mouth). Before Bill is captured, Ramu, the Captain and the natives come up with a plan to save Bill and M.J. once he gives himself up. They decide to attack at night under the cover of darkness. Bill is captured by Razak (He says, ""Is the doctor in?""), while we see potential green-skinned head donors herded into a shed. M.J. is wearing a rather fetching flowered bikini top with matching sarong, while Bill tries to convince Dr. Lorca that he is on his side because the government gave him no other choice but for him to resign, otherwise he faced time in prison (all of it is a lie; or is it?). Dr. Lorca believes the chlorophyll monster is harmless while its head is removed, but he will soon find out that is not the case. In the meantime, Bill and M.J. find some time to get busy (I guess he forgot all about Sheila after seeing M.J. in her getup, but he certainly does get his share of women, doesn't he?). As nighttime approaches. Bill's plan goes into action, just as Razak picks another green-skinned native to be the recipient of losing his noggin for science. Bill's crew surround the camp and the generator is destroyed, just as Dr. Lorca is about to remove the native's head. They wait for the emergency generator to kick-in, while the two warring parties outside begin killing each other (We see people blown apart with grenades, riddled with bullets, slashed and impaled with machetes and impaled with spears). The backup generator kicks in, which turns out to be bad news for Dr. Lorca. M.J.'s would-be rapist captures her once again with rape on his mind, but Laida stabs him in the back. Still not dead, the rapist turns his attention towards Laida, but M.J. finishes him off with a spear to his back (Hey, at least he got two penetrations!). Razak is killed when Bill pumps him full of lead. Laida lets all the infected green people out of the shed, only to discover one of them is her father. The headless chlorophyll monster breaks the bindings from the operating table and the head says to Dr. Lorca, ""We can talk now, Lorca!"" The headless body tosses Dr. Lorca around like a ragdoll, while the monster's head laughs. The headless body then crushes Dr. Lorca's head with a heavy piece of electronic equipment, but also starts a fire in the process. For those of you looking for the chlorophyll monster to reattach its head with its body as shown on the poster and other advertising material, I'm afraid that never happens, because the entire laboratory caves-in, but not before Bill is able to collect some of Dr. Lorca's paperwork (in order to prove to the scientific community what is going on under their nose; or maybe what he said about being forced to quit was true and he's going to use the information for his own experiments). The natives set the camp on fire and it explodes. So ends the Blood Island Trilogy, but what exactly is in that crate we see the last native carrying away? I'm afraid we will never know, but I would like to think it is the head of the chlorophyll monster. This is the only film of the Blood Island Trilogy that was directed solely by Eddie Romero (BEAST OF THE YELLOW NIGHT - 1970; THE WOMAN HUNT - 1972; THE TWILIGHT PEOPLE - 1972; BEYOND ATLANTIS - 1973; BLACK MAMA WHITE MAMA - 1973; SAVAGE SISTERS - 1974; SUDDEN DEATH - 1975; all starring John Ashley). He co-directed the first two films in the series with Gerry De Leon (TERROR IS A MAN - 1959; BLOOD OF THE VAMPIRES - 1966) who, for some reason, passed on participating in this film. It's obvious the the headache-inducing rapid in-and-out zooming shots that were in the previous film were DeLeon's idea, because this film has none of it and that's a relief. Although the film starts out rather mild, as it advances it becomes more and more violent. The head transplant scene, where Dr. Lorca is cutting away the skin on the neck is quite surprising for a PG-Rated film, even for back then. John Ashley has always made for a bland action hero, but he publicly stated that he loved doing exploitation films, so at least he got to do what he loved. I just wished he lived long enough to share his stories about the time he spent in the Philippines (a country he loved). He must have had some doozies, especially if the love scene he filmed with Angelique Pettyjohn in MAD DOCTOR was the real thing (which Pettyjohn claims). This is a grand end to an interesting trilogy and can probably claim to be the three films that made people aware that there was a film industry in the Philippines. For that we can all be thankful. The TV versions of this film were missing about 10 minutes of footage, so the best way to go is get the cheap Alpha New Cinema DVD-R, which is a port of the OOP Image Entertainment DVD, minus a couple of extras (The DVD-R still has the Celeste Yarnall interview and she still looks good. It also has a collection of trailers, including the MAD DOCTOR one narrated by a manic Brother Theodore and a commentary track by Sam Sherman). These films have only ever been released in fullscreen, so my hope is that some enterprising DVD company would release all three films in widescreen. But the Philippines film industry was known to not treat their film prints with any care, so widescreen prints may not even exist anymore, unless someone has the Hemisphere Pictures 35mm prints that were released in U.S. theaters. Stranger things have happened. Also starring Angel Buenaventura and Johnny Long. An Alpha New Cinema DVD-R Release. Rated PG.",1414627200,4,13283,4.499792960662526

1786307,4,B00006LPDV,"Eddie Romero's classic BLOOD ISLAND trilogy concludes w/ BEAST OF BLOOD. Global mega-star, John Ashley returns as gun-toting pathologist, Dr. Foster. BEAST picks up right where MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND left off. The chlorophyll zombie / monster has survived, and goes on another killing spree! Foster is the sole survivor of the creature's attack. Joined by a reporter (Celeste Yarnall), Foster hunts the monster, enlisting a band of natives, including a beautiful woman who is very handy w/ her huge throwing knife! Uh-oh! The eeevil Dr. Lorca (Eddie Garcia) seems to have returned as well! He's continued to carry out his diabolical chlorophyll experiments! Can Dr. Foster and his crew possibly stop Lorca? Will the now decapitated monster rise from Lorca's lab? Will there be more excuses for young lasses to take their tops off? Of course! Add this baby to your collection immediately!...  P.S.- My favorite quote from the movie: ""Re-attach the artificial head!""...",1276819200,6,971,5.2243589743589745

It still remain one of my favorites.  Get out the popcorn and enjoy!",1257552000,,175,4.303030303030303
1786309,3,B00006LPDV,"Beast Of Blood is a sequel to Mad Doctor of Blood Island, and the last of the Blood Island trilogy.  Therefore I certainly wouldn't recommend it unless you've already seen Mad Doctor.  Like Halloween 2 or the Phantasm sequels, this film begins almost immediately after the events of the previous film.
That pesky chlorophyll monster has survived and has made it back to Blood Island after massacring everyone aboard the boat back to the mainland......everybody except for John Ashley that is!  Ashley returns to Blood Island after recovering from the boat explosion in the hopes of hunting down and killing the chlorophyll beast....THE BEAST OF BLOOD!  Now he's teamed up with a blonde reporter named Myra(she's kinda got the hots for him, and that's understandable coz who in their right mind wouldn't have the hots for John Ashley?).  Once on Blood Island, Ashley finds out that not only has the Beast survived, but so has his nemesis, Dr. Lorca(now played by Eddie Garcia).  Lorca's keeping the Beast in his lab.  The Beast has somehow lost his head, and now the head and body are kept separate as Lorca tries different experiments with the body.  Lorca kidnaps Myra to lure Ashley, and the final battle of Blood Island is fought.
This is probably the least entertaining of the trilogy.  A good chunk of the film  pretty much consists of John Ashley wandering around the jungle and his plan to find Myra and free her.  There's very little monster action.  The film begins with a bang as the Beast grabs an axe and goes to town aboard the boat, hacking folks into coleslaw. But aside from that bit of nasty fun, he spends most of the time strapped to a examination table(his body does anyway).  I guess it could have succeeded as a kind of quirky adventure film if the scenes in the jungle in pursuit of Myra were in the least bit exciting, but they're not.  The film only really comes alive when the Beast is onscreen which is too rare.  The Beast has been given a modified and cooler look now.  His eyes are more defined and he has a nasty set of fangs, which looks much more sinister than the mossy blob of a face he had in the previous film.
The movie has the same look and feel of the previous movies, so it has that good ol' feeling of familiarity if you'd enjoyed the series.
Beast of Blood isn't terrible and will surely be a must-see if you saw the previous two films.  Though a bit of a letdown, it does have it's moments.  So, if you dig wacky Filipino John Ashley movies with headless green blooded monsters and sexy island chicks, you could do worse than this one.",1215648000,5,2579,4.545454545454546

7972089,3,B00006LPDV,"Long has a vague memory of some severed, decaying talking head stuck somewhere in a jungle haunted the recesses of my imagination. Growing up in SoCal I would always check out Monster Rally to see if any giant monsters were there lurking about and I would usually ignore the small human-sized icons of horror, excepting for the Creature from the Black Lagoon. But I remember coming across some chattering severed skull and I couldn't place the movie. Could it have been Beast of Blood with its severed head in a glass container spurting out green blood? Ultimately I just don't know but chances are pretty good. I would have been drawn to the Asiatic island locale wondering if some Godzilla-esque kaiju would spring up. I highly doubt that my parents would have let me watch this movie (greatly edited down for TV at that time) given its green gooey gruesomeness oozing out of its pores and all of the islanders shooting at and stabbing each other but they probably didn't have to stop me from watching as the gurgling head sans body probably would have freaked me out enough to turn the channel. Watching this movie now, in an unedited (probably? Im not sure but theres a little bit of nudity so probably) version, I wouldnt let this one near my little ones. Ultimately though Beast of Blood has some creepy moments and memorable shots, like the gurgling severed head in Dr. Lorcas lab, it suffers greatly under the weight of literally watching characters plod through thick jungles back and forth, back and forth, and then back and forth again. I mean, seriously, there is a lot of foot travel in this movie! I don't think that they needed their Fitbits!

The movie is famous for being a Philippine horror movie much like there are a lot of low-budget Mexican-set horror movies. But its more famous for being a part of the so-called Blood Island Trilogy. I don't know much about all of this other than this is the third and final entry. The DVD did contain a few previews including at least a preview for the first of the trilogy, and possibly the second movie as well. So this film will now only really be of interest for those schlock-hounds or for a one-off viewing for people like me who may have some strange itch from a grotesque memory that they just couldn't place, but they needed to scratch. 2.5 stars.",1512345600,,2315,4.618932038834951

7972091,3,B00006LPDV,"Compared to the other two Blood Island movies this is sort of dull.  A lot of walking around and talking.  Celeste Yarnall (of Star Trek's The Apple Fame) was very perky, if you know what I mean in 1970.  The ""horror"" portion was sort of a let down.  And the commentary was really dull.  It dealt more with the U.S. company that distributed the movie than the movie itself.  But on the other hand there is that whole topless Celeste Yarnall thing so the movie has that going for it.  Oh, and there was a hot ass kicking ""native"" girl (who had access to eye liner, lipstick and hair conditioner) too.",1498435200,,599,4.342342342342342
