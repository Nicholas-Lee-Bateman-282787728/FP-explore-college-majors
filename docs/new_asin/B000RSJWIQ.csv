8202429,1,B000RSJWIQ,I was hoping for an informational video. This is only unlabeled pictures set to music. There is absolutely no information given about Puerto Rico. I was very disappointed. Definitely not worth more than $5.00 if you went to Puerto Rico and forgot to take your camera.,1260662400,3,267,4.826086956521739
