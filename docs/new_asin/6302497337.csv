7826866,5,6302497337,"My favorite thing about these Christmas episodes is that they actually contain the true meaning of Christmas.  Family making gifts for the children who will be in the hospital over Christmas(setting a good example for todays over-indulged children) and Mr. B getting annoyed over how commercial everything has become, an issue that certainly rings even truer these days.  Embrace a time when Christmas is a family time not just a rushed time or all about presents.  Pick up this collection!  Merry Christmas!  :)",1374451200,2,512,5.120481927710843
7826867,5,6302497337,Love this product.  I only wish it was on DVD instead of VHS!  Hazel is full of fun!!!  A great show to watch anytime!!!,1298592000,,120,3.9166666666666665
7826868,5,6302497337,"This great two-story video celebrates humanity and humor in the heartwarming and embraceable persona of Hazel, the loveable and irrepressable housekeeper. One episode in black and white celebrates Missy's great affection for her housekeeper. And one episode in color demonstrates the metamorphisis of a dissatisfied husband/boss into a happy fellow ready to celebrate with the family. Great for the season, but great to watch anytime you're feeling blue or short on humanity.",1086220800,5,475,5.611111111111111
