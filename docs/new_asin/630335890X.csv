This is the worst video in the all salsa history. I don't consider the yoga is a good idea to warm up  neither.  The music for salsa step is not even salsa music, so I dot recomend it to anybody.",1123372800,2,357,3.9305555555555554

It is not a vigorous work-out, but perfect for someone like myself who wants to start exercising regularly.  I look forward to doing this routine daily.",1011225600,2,274,4.666666666666667
