2583767,4,B000FSL8W6,"I bought this video from one of her swim clinics. It is a great video, and shows you the technique to get you going fast. If you want to learn how to get the most out of your arms to catch and pull that water, check out this video. Very well done video with multiple angles and slow motion to see how she does it. My only knock on the video is it is a bit short and I wish it went over breathing a bit more, and even kicking.",1206316800,7,425,3.7333333333333334
2583768,5,B000FSL8W6,"I bought this video as a result of reading an article Karlyn wrote. I did not expect it to be much different than any other swim video, but boy was I wrong. This video showed so much detail and touches on just about every swim topic one could imagine. I recently started swimming and just joined the USMS.  This video showed me some awesome techniques and was very tastefully done. I watch it at least once a week to stay on top of my game. This is by far the best Freestyle swim video I have ever layed eyes on.",1196640000,8,512,4.12

8126146,3,B000FSL8W6,"This is a very good video. The most important subject for me is that it gives instruction of how to set the arms in order to achive the EVF position.

I am looking for how to improve my time in the pool, so it helps me.",1286064000,,219,3.760869565217391
8126147,2,B000FSL8W6,"As a new swimmer, i was hoping to get more detailed instruction, but it is mostly just Karlyn swimming up and down the pool with some commentary to go along with that. Maybe I'll watch it few more time and can pick something up from the DVD, but my first impression is that this DVD was not for me.",1236643200,,298,4.067796610169491
8126148,3,B000FSL8W6,"I swim laps on a very regular basis and have completed several Ironman triathlons. Since I don't have a coach, I sometimes buy videos like this to help keep my technique clean. This instructional video has several good tips for swimming freestyle, and some people will probably benefit from it. However, I didn't find it nearly as helpful as ""Fishlike Freestyle"", which I liked much more. I found ""Fishlike Freestyle"" useful enough that I have watched it about five time over the past few years. I watched the video in this review one time and I might not bother watching it again. If you are making an either-or choice, I suggest Fishlike Freestyle.  If you have money to spend on more than one freestyle video, then you might consider buying this one too.  The cost is lower than the cost of one private lesson with a coach.  If you can make even one improvement to your technique, then the video is worth the cost.",1223769600,3,917,4.579268292682927
8126149,5,B000FSL8W6,"I enjoyed the video a lot. I ve used other video s and techniques but this was the best so far.
There are several suggestions to improve your stroke and when you start the major ones the improvement is instant. I t s a skill sport and you want to have the skills.
She is very easy on the eyes.",1220400000,,293,3.9

8126151,5,B000FSL8W6,"I went to a Total Immersion tri camp a few years ago, and have been working on those drills since that time. I still feel 'slow' but more efficient. Karlyn and her husband walked into my tri coaches running/tri store ( [...] in Kirkland, WA---the best sports store in the Northwest) and met him and left some copies of her video. He's races Ironman, and was a little skeptical, but is open to new ideas. He watched the video, and then incorporated what he'd learned in his next swim workout. I cant remember how many seconds he shaved off his 100, but it was pretty substantial. Enough that he did another 100 just to see if it was a fluke. It wasnt. He got in contact w/ Karlyn and set up a clinic w/ she and her husband that I attended a few weeks ago. IT was AWESOME. I bought the video so I could get used to the drills before the clinic. Both Karlyn and her husband (who's also her coach) are the most down to earth, humble and incredible people (and athletes--her husband is also an amazing swimmer, and Ironman) who are wonderful, patient teachers.

The clinic was great-and I've been workin on the drills and technique ever since. I was skeptical b/c for awhile I thought that 'Total Immersion' was the only 'way'. Drill drill drill. I've learned from my coach to have an open mind and to be willing to try new things, not jumping on the next fad, but knowing that as technique and technology progress...we get to keep learning and benifiting from that progress. And, get faster and more efficient.
Highly recommend this video!!",1207353600,14,1536,4.485714285714286
