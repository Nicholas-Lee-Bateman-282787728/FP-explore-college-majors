8240698,5,B00116GEE8,"Can't wait to watch this. We saw the replay of this main fight (B.J. Penn and Joe Stevenson). They would have these marathons - just play em back to back....well, this fight was THE bloodiest fight we have ever seen! It was so cool! So yah, we can't wait to watch this again! :-) Thks for the DVD at such a great price!",1418774400,,319,4.079365079365079
8240699,4,B00116GEE8,"This is, in my opinion, a very good UFC event. The main event between Penn and Stevenson is my favorite UFC fight ever. A couple of really bad pre-lim bouts ::ahem, opening bout::, prevent this from being an all out 5 star event.

However, I feel that buyers should know that I have purchased THREE different copies of this disc, all of which have pixelated and skipped at the exact same spot (about 43-44 minutes in). NONE of these copies have been purchased from Amazon. Part of me would like to think that it's my DVD player, but this is the ony DVD I've had any problems with. And the fact that it skips in the exact same spot every time...that's just wierd. And unnacceptable.

So absolutely check out this event, but beware of technical difficulties.",1250380800,,756,4.551470588235294
8240700,5,B00116GEE8,"This UFC was one of the best events in recent UFC history. I loved every fight. I think there was only 1 decision, and even that one was great.
 If you want to see non-stop action, knock outs, & submissions, you cant go wrong with this DVD.
 Warning: there is one EXTREMELY BLOODY fight. It was a minor injury, but it looks VERY BAD. If you can't stand blood, you might want to skip this one. But then again, if you can't stand blood, why are you watching MMA?",1245974400,,460,4.157303370786517

UFC 80: Rapid Fire brought UFC fans once again to England.  Those fans were treated to a solid night of fights and the showdown for the Lightweight title between BJ Penn and Joe Stevenson.

Penn, having recommitted himself to the sport that sprung him to stardom, is a fierce competitor - and Joe ""Daddy"" Stevenson is as solid a challenger as the UFC had in the division. This is an awesome fight - not to be missed...

Gabriel Gonzaga, fresh off of his loss to Randy Couture, took on surging heavyweight challenger Fabricio Werdum in a rematch.  These two had fought years back, with Werdum coming out on top.

There were not many other notable fights on the card, but the chosen lineup did a good job delivering a lot of excitement.  All in all, the night ended with only 2 Decisions, while there was 1 Submission and 6 TKO's/KO's!!!

Definitely worth picking up for your collection.",1225065600,,944,4.644578313253012
8240702,5,B00116GEE8,Don't ignore the four fighters on the cover; because their fights were good. The fight between Paul Kelly vs Paul Taylor in the prelims(not shown on the pay per view) stole the show!,1213056000,,182,4.545454545454546
8240703,5,B00116GEE8,"This is one of the fastest paced UFC events in a long time, most fights delivered explosive endings.  The decisions (only 2 of them) were excellent.  Many skipped this because it was in England and that screwed with the ppv's airing.  Many skipped it because it doesn't any top LHW or WW guys.

But if you like mma and you didn't manage to see this, you'll likely want to buy this one.",1211587200,,385,4.305555555555555
8240704,4,B00116GEE8,"If you'd ever been fooled by simply looking at the likes of B J Penn, and assuming he's a chump, that's a bad assumption you just made! Before I watched the fight with Matt Hughes in UFC 46, I'd picked up UFC 58, and I laughed when I saw that some dude named B J Penn was taking on Georges St. Pierre. Well, St. Pierre won, but by split decision. B J Penn is one tough dude, and don't you doubt that for one second! When you can do things with your legs without the help of your arms, that's impressive. Then you have Joe Stevenson, winner of TUF #2, not to mention he's won over a ton of people! After he defeated Luke Cummo to win the contract, he fought Yves Edwards in UFC 61. No fight with a man like Yves Edwards is an easy fight, but due to cuts on the top of his head, the fight was stopped after the 2nd round, and Stevenson was awarded the win by TKO. His latest fight was an impressive unanimous decision over Kurt Pellegrino, and ""Joe Daddy"" was given this opportunity. The opportunity to win the Lightweight title. You just have to get past B J Penn! But the title is an interim title since Sean Sherk was stripped of the title after being found guilty by the California State Athletic Commission. We've got a title fight!!
Now the other fight featured the the gladiator introduction is a strange but interesting match-up. Fabricio Werdum is taking on Gabriel Gonzaga. Well, WHOOP-TEE-DOO, right? Maybe, but why? What makes this such a co-main event over the other fights on the card? Well, before his title shot loss to Randy Couture, Werdum was the only man to defeat Gonzaga. It was in 2003, and it was in the 3rd round by TKO. And having a pretty crappy performance in his UFC debut when he fought Andre Arlovski, this might be a chance for redemption. It is also a chance for Gonzaga to get back on track, as well as avenge his very first loss.

This was a UFC where some of the preliminary fights simply needed to stay preliminary, but not all of them. And it was a decent card altogether. There are 9 fights total, and I'll list them below.

Sam Stout vs. Per Eklund: Stout wants to come out swinging and finish his Swedish opponent. It gets interesting at times, but nothing too impressive. Goes to a unanimous decision.

Alessio Sakara vs. James Lee: This ended pretty quickly, but was it stopped TOO quickly? TKO victory.

Paul Kelly vs. Paul Taylor: This was a brawl! This was a war!! Scraps like this keep the fans coming back! Unanimous decision.

Antoni Hardonk vs. Colin Robinson: Another quick one, quicker than the Sakara/Lee fight. TKO.

Jorge Rivera vs. Kendall Grove: Both of these guys are coming off of KO losses, looking to get back on track. This finishes with a KO in under a minute and a half.

Wilson Gouveia vs. Jason Lambert: Both of these guys have shown some tough stuff in the past. You wanna talk highlight knock outs? THIS IS A HIGHLIGHT REEL KO in round 2!

Jess Liaudin vs. Marcus Davis: Hey! Another KO!! 1st round.

Gabriel Gonzaga vs. Fabricio Werdum: Well, one of these guys gets back on track with a TKO near the end of round 2.

B J Penn vs. Joe Stevenson: Ok, in the dictionary under BLOODBATH, it says, SEE THIS FIGHT!!! I mean, that freaking octagon floor could've been painted with blood in this. But it ends with a submission near the end of round 2.

What else can be said? Oh yeah!

SEAN SHERK...YOU'RE DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1209859200,3,3404,4.446227929373997
8240705,5,B00116GEE8,"If you haven't been satisfied with previous UFC releases, due mostly to lack of replays/in between round discussion then you will be with this one. Every replay was shown! If that isn't something good enough, the fights definatley are!

8240706,3,B00116GEE8,"So let me set the stage for this review.  UFC fan since 1995.  Watch every event I can get my hands on.  This was the first PPV I missed on PPV in 10 years and was slightly dissapointed with this purchase.

I personally haven't bought a UFC DVD since UFC 32 but was unimpressed with the following on this particular item:

1.  The fights seemed 'rushed'.  Commentating between fights and backstage interviews were missing from the broadcast.  I kinda like to feel like I'm watching the PPV when watching a DVD, didn't get that feeling from this.

2.  The announcers audio track was screwed up!  Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg could NOT be heard when the intro music was on and barely heard through matches.  Someone screwed up royally here!!

Otherwise, great video quality but I must say I prefer the old Anchor Bay/Trimark versions of these events as they felt more like the PPV broadcast.  I guess I'll stick to PPV.  These DVD's just aren't the same after the fact...",1209513600,,968,4.578947368421052
