2420765,2,B000BITVN8,"First of all, I just want to comment that this isn't the place & people don't come here to read why people think TNA is better than WWE or visa versa.  If one person is a fan of WWE then so be it & the same goes for TNA fans.  Just review the damn DVD so people know if it's worth buying or not.

Basically I've seen all the TNA PPV DVD's released so far (and for those wondering about Victory Road, Turning Point, and Lockdown...look for that TNA anthology boxset) and this so far has been one of the most disappointing.  The crowd just wasn't into the PPV past the first match until the last four and alot of the midcard matches were average to just poor but here's my review.

Primetime vs. Petey Williams - Nice match between two in the X division.

B.G. James (Road Dogg) & Jeff Hammond (from NASCAR) vs. Bentley & Kazarian - Dud match, just tryin' to get some publicity from having someone in NASCAR in a TNA ring.

Raven vs. Dustin Rhodes - Another match that was a dud.

AMW vs. Kid Kash/Lance Hoyt - Again, another match that just didn't do anything.  It was average but the crowd was dead which made it seem worse.

Full Metal Mayhem (basically another way of saying a TLC match): Jeff Hardy vs. Abyss - You'll pop for this one if you like the weapons matches but it just seemed really sloppy and it was just an off night for them.  If they didn't have the high spots through the tables, this match would have sucked.  It was better than everything past the first match so it would look better than it did.

DDP/Alpha Male vs. Team Canada - The crowd really got into this one.  And I'm shocked that this was a better tag match than the Tag Team Title match.  Great match.

30 min. Ironman match: X champion AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - This match is for those who say the X Division is just fill of high spots & car crash matches (ahem, Batista, ahem) because they guys did a great straight one on one match.  This best match of the night for me.
Note: This is also available on the ""Best Of The X Division Vol. 1"" DVD.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash - It was a better match than I expected but then again, it's not something I would rush out & see.  It was boring until the brawling, weapons & interference (Billy Gunn & X-Pac) made it an above average match.

Bonus Section: Basically two tag team squash matches with Team Trinity (Phi Delta Slam) & Team Traci (the Disciples of Destruction a.k.a. Harris Boys & Creative Control in WCW, Skull & 8-Ball from D.O.A. in WWF) in some storyline with they're fighting to become Dusty Rhodes assistant.

Overall, the best match on the card (ironman match) is available on another & better DVD that's the the same price as this one.  Aside from the opening Primetime vs. Williams & the last 3 matches, the rest of the PPV was just boring.  If you want the TNA PPV's available right now (only the first six), don't start with this one.",1134518400,,2906,4.301470588235294

8087507,4,B000BITVN8,"The NWA World heavyweight championship match between Jeff Jarrett & Kevin Nash while not a great bout it was still a entertaining and decent brawl and could have done alot better without the cello(don't ask). The 30 minute Ironman match X-Division championship between A.J. Styles & Christopher Daniels was hard-hitting,solid & met expectations. The Full Metal Mayhem match between Jeff Hardy & Abyss was a good reminder of Hardy's TLC matches in the WWE. The rest were OK. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1278115200,,506,4.827586206896552

8087509,3,B000BITVN8,"Here are the results of TNA's Against All Odds 2005 PPV.

Elix Skipper VS Petey Williams: A decent, short opener. Skipper misses alot of moves in this match. Its ruined halfway thru when they reveal Skipper has a new move and wants to show it. If thats not a spoiler alert to who wins this match, then I guess they had to blurt out Skipper is going win this match with his new move! Two great wrestlers and one bad match.

BG James @ Jeff Hammond VS Matt Bentley @ Kazarian: Just like WCW, TNA uses stars from other sports to attract a crowd. I don't think it really works. BG James still using the same shtick from his glory days. A bad match.

Dustin Rhodes VS Raven: Raven and Rhodes are both good wrestlers and there feud had a good storyline going. The matches between these two, sucked.

AMW VS Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt: While it was a good match, the ending ruined it for me. Watch at how Lance is placed in AMW's finishing move. He doesnt sell the move as he is going up and looks like he is resting on a hammock. It ruined the match.

Jeff Hardy VS Abyss in Full Metal Mayhem! I cant really say much for this match. Its what you'd expect it to be. The ending was cool though. I cant believe they never did anything with Hardy.

DDP and Monty Brown VS Team Canada: Again, I hate Team Canada. Its funny how people like Eric Young. He is TNA's version of Eugene, expect for the speical part. Again, I liked the ending though.

AJ Styles VS Christopher Daniels: I don't know why but TNA Iron Man matches never really worked for me. I think it was because the X-division is so fast paced that a Iron Man match slowed down the pace of the matches. Still a good match though.

Kevin Nash VS Jeff Jarrett: Nash is always criticized as one of the worst champion of all time. Funny how a babyface got over by saying he doesnt care for the belt, just the money. Well I cant say if fans liked Nash or not. This match sucked. It had a few cool spots but nothing speical. Kip James appeared and it stunned West and Tenay because they didn't know what to call him. It was a funny moment. Then Sean Waltman comes in and they say its a D-X Reunion! Too bad HBK and Triple H didn't come out and help Nash. As in early TNA, Jarrett retains the belt by cheating. Ive watched all the PPV's from 2005 and some in between and im always wondering why TNA main events are always 20 minutes or less.

Not a good PPV. Lot of matches were very short and didn't seem to be complete. The main event was atrocious. TNA really needs to work on main events if they want to overtake WWE as the #1 wrestling company. Full Metal Mayhem and the Iron Man match were good but on other TNA dvd compilations. I still wonder how TNA is still running today.",1199923200,,2722,4.179389312977099

1. The Naturals vs. Austin Aries and Rodreick Strong- This was a good choice to kick off the show. This was when the naturals were managed by Shane Douglass. This match was a solid tag match with some high flying moves but average at best. Winners The Naturals. Match Rating 7/10.
2. 4 way X-Division Match Alex Shelly vs. Jay Leathel vs. Petey Williams vs. Matt Bentely- This was once again another solid X-Division match put together by TNA. This match was just non stop action. There were so many high flying moves. A very good match that was given enough time. Winner Jay Leathel. Match Rating 7.5/10.
3. The James Gang vs. LAX- This was the worst match of the night. I have always thought that the James Gang had no talent and they conitued to show me it here as it was not LAX's fault this match sucked it was the James gang. The match seemed like a filler but I will say that I was impressed by LAX. You can skip this one. Winners LAX. Match Rating 2.5/10.
4. Americas Most Wanted vs. Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt- This was another solid match and made up for the tag team match before it. This was during the reign of Americas greatest title run. Both teams styles mixed really well with the power of AMW and the speed of sabin and dutt. Not a whole lot to say here except both teams put on a good match. Winners and still NWA tag team champs AMW. Match Rating 7/10.
5. Rhino vs. Abyss in a falls count anywhere match- This was a very good match. I have learned to assume that almost any match Abyss is in will be entertaining because he is willing to put his body on the line every time he is in the ring. This match was no different. The match started out in the back but it worked itself to the front where there were tons of tables, trash cans, kendo sticks you name it. There were some sick parts in the match including a chockslam through a table and a gore thorough a table. The ending was sick as they were set up in the stands and rhino gored Abyss off the stands through 4 tables below a great moment. Winner Rhino. Match Rating 8/10.
6.  Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels a triple threat match for the X-Division title- This was a great match. Coming into this match this already had a great riveraly going with Daniels and Joe and styles was mixed in as well. The match just flowed really well but was a step down from there first triple threat match. This was also one of those matches were there was just non stop action all the way through. There were tons of near falls that kept you on the edge of your seet making you wonder if Joe was finnaly going to lose still a great match. Winner and still X-Division champ Samoa Joe. Match Rating 9.5/10.
7. Team 3D vs. Team Canada- This match was voted for by fans online. This was still a decent match. People think team 3D is a bad team but I think they still put on decent matches. Just a solid match that was on the card so it would calm the crowd down after that 3 way X-Division match. There was some nice aftermath with team 3D putting team Canada through a table. Winners Team Canada. Match Rating 6.5/10.
8. Jeff Jarret vs. Christian Cage for the TNA Title- This was a great match to close off this show. I had already felt this was a good show but I felt this match could make or break the ppv. It sure as hell made it a lot better. Jarret has a really old school style and that's how the match started with Jarret controlling it and than turning to a brawl on the outside. They had a rule that if anyone interfered they would be fired on the spot. They picked Erl Hebner as the ref and they used the Montreal screw job to hype the match more. Jarret used gail kim when the refs back was turned great strategy. They had a lot of near falls including Jarret hitting cage with the guatir but Christian some how kicked out. Christian reversed the stroke into the unprietter for the pin. The aftermath with the fans celebrating in the ring was a great choice by TNA great stuff. Winner and new NWA champ Christian Cage. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give TNA against all odds a grade of 56.5/80 which is a 71% which means this is an awesome ppv. I would say that is right I got this dvd for $8 it was a great pick up and don't hesitate to pick it up. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate it and don't hesitate to comment.",1184630400,,4432,4.243786982248521

8087512,4,B000BITVN8,"This is a review of TNA Against All Odds 2005.  I will not engage in the TNA vs. WWE war of words as I like both,but I must say TNA is gainig on WWE especialy with their P.P.V.  Anyway,here is the review.

""Primetime"" Elix Skipper vs. Petey Williams:
This was a nice,energetic matchup,though no storyline,but I guess it was a X division championship consideration match.  Skipper wins it with his ""SuddenDeath."" 6/10

BG James and Nascar's Jeff Hammond vs. Matt Bently and Kazarian:
Way over hyped,but TNA is known for bringing in other sports ""Stars.  ""It's funny how Hammond still can't wrestle after alot of trainning.  BG and Hammond sill win it. 5/10

Dustin Rhodes vs. Raven:
Normal match,nothing special.  Raven is in a midcard match for the second P.P.V in a row,thats underuseing.  Raven wins with a rollup,'his feet were on the turnbuckle.  'The aftermath was lacking though Raven used a straightjacket.  Could of been better especialy with Raven at the helm. 6/10

""Alpha Male"" Monty Brown and Diamond Dallas Page vs. Team Canada:
This match was kind of a squash match,though the star power makes it actually decent.  Monty Brown and DDP win it with Monty's ""Pounce.""6/10

""Full Metal Mayhem"": ""The Monster"" Abyss vs. ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy:
This match came after Abyss returned at Final Resolution,attacking Hardy. You may say this is a TLC ripoff as it has all the TLC characteristics.  Hardy takes an unexpected dive off of the the stage,as I thought he was going to do a plant-jump but he just kind of fell off of the stage.  Hardy manages to crawl back into the ring and grab one of the hung envelopes but it was the wrong one! So Abyss gets back into the ring and pushes Hardy off the ladder into about two tables,then Abyss climbed to the top to get the NWA championship title shot. 8/10

NWA Tag Team title match:AMW vs. Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt:
This matchup was very physical,but wasn't all that good,though it was the best tag team match of the night.  AMW retain. 7/10

Ironman X division title match:(C)""The Phenomanal""AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels:
This started out slow but it's 30 ""plus"" minute match so I shouldn't complain.  Daniels gets a pinfall pretty early then dominates awhile.  Styles comes back and gets a Styles Clash,so its 1-1.  Daniels gets irrate starts pounding AJ.Daniels locks on a Japaneese/ leg scissors adapted move and the blood is just dripping from AJ's head but he holds on and the time expires.  About 5 minutes into SuddenDeath,AJ nails a Styles Clash on Daniels and gets the 1-2-3. AJ retains. 9/10

NWA World Title match:""King of The Mountain""(C)Jeff Jarrett vs. ""Big Sexy""Kevin Nash:
It wasn't all that good untill the brawling started,after that it was pretty good.  Kip James makes his debut as a heel then Sean Waltman makes his return as a face.  Jarrett starts his underhanded tactics,it takes forever for him to put Nash away but he does.  Jarrett retains. 8/10

Best match:AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels
Worst match:Dustin Rhodes vs. Raven

Extras:Two tag team Matches:5/10
