2928035,5,B000UZRT4A,This was just too amazing to put into words. Lets just say if you love to do modern fusion bellydance this is perfect to learn. The robotics and ticking was awesome. I can't wait to try it out in performance.,1205712000,2,208,4.225
2928036,5,B000UZRT4A,"This is a comprehensive program with emphasis at modern tribal style dance merged with belly dance.
Assuming you are familiar with the language of belly dance and have moved into your own  particular style, I would venture to say, this is a great beginning video in the tribal style. Ashara patiently takes you from  the complex, to the  smooth approach  from basic belly dance posture ,  basic moves such as chest movements, hip isolations and embellishing them into more intricate, accented, sharp moves.

To begin, the warm up session: arm isolations, torso rotations,deep lunges.
Followed by comprehensive lessons in the following areas:
Dance posture
Upper body articulating:
Arm and shoulder isolations in the tribal style
Chest squares and slides, lifts and drops circles
Lower body:
Gluteus contractions, sharp accented hips, hips up and down
Vertical 8's up and down, on releve, and flat foot
A great breakdown on the variations of the  shimmy, pelvic contractions, in squares and smoothed into circles.
Ticking, robotic, and mechanical movement section! Reducing range of motion and adding sharpness to create accents.
An entire segment devoted to the mechanism of tribal style movement where chest, hip movements are broken down into locks and the typical robotic like movements characteristic of the style
A simple, short cool down session as you finish the program.
Remarkable performances by Ashara herself but before then,, learn a simple choreography broken down into six very well explained, and fun combinations.

I found this program one of the better, user friendly approaches to what others seem to keep mysterious and complex. It is in-depth knowledge presented plain and simple. The pleasant Ashara unlocks all the secrets of the great tribal style moves with ease and confidence. A great learning  tool that is also enjoyable and win you well into the modern flair so popular for this day, tribal belly dance.",1205020800,12,1933,5.229773462783172
2928037,5,B000UZRT4A,I love this dvd!!! I practice ticking every night and it is exhausting and I love it!  I also love this style of dance so for me this dvd is awesome.  I highly recommend it.,1204070400,3,173,3.914285714285714
2928038,4,B000UZRT4A,"This video is very long, and I haven't yet worked with the entire thing. However, I thought I'd post this up to give people considering purchasing it some info... I may come back and edit this later.

I need to say to begin with that I'm really not fond of the dancing on this video. I'm not that crazy about tribal fusion anyway, but I've definitely seen tribal fusion I've liked a lot more than this.

So, weirdly, as much as I don't like the dancing here, I think the video itself is pretty well done, and can actually foresee myself using it. The main reason for this is that its ""Warmup & Conditioning"" section is actually a 45 minute exercise and stretching video for dancers, and it's pretty much the answer to my dreams. Seriously, I've imagined what I'd like in a program (often because of exercises I've had in live classes), and this is it.

This section alone could stand alone as a full-priced DVD, and would be worth the money. It's a combination of movements from three groups: yoga, ballet (i.e., the kind of stretches you have at the start of a ballet/ballet- inspired class), and Suhaila-type seated abdominal and chest work. Nothing terribly new, but having them all together in one place is incredibly cool. There's deep plie work, thorough leg stretches in every possible direction, the shoulders and neck are not ignored, and neither is the back. Asharah also gives frequent knee placement reminders, so although the practice is challenging, it won't kill your back or knees.

The next section is a Technique & Isolations section of 55 minutes. In this section, Asharah goes over pretty basic movements in bd/tribal fusion vocabulary, but explains them in detail with the appropriate muscle contractions. She's very Suhaila-based (and, in fact, thanks Suhaila in the credits). Here she covers:

- Shoulders and arms
- Chest squares
- Chest circles
- Glute contactions
- Glute contactions - up
- Glute contactions - down
- Vertical hip 8s down-to-up
- Vertical hip 8s up-to-down
- 3/4 shimmy up
- 3/4 shimmy down
- interior hip squares
- interior hip circles

These are pretty basic moves (I know the last one as an ""omi""), but it's good to have the breakdown and practice, especially for those of us who are far from being experts anyway.

Next comes the ""Modern Tribal Movement"" section (30 min), in which Asharah teaches how to break down a single movement into three or four smaller segments, so as to achieve a strobing or robotic effect. She does this with: shoulders & arms, chest slides, chest locks, undulations, and vertical hip 8s up-to-down. I haven't watched this section all the way through, and like I said, I don't really like how the result looks in dance, but it did strike me that some of the exercises were similar in concept to those on Aziza's Practice Companion. So, weirdly, although I don't want to dance like Asharah, I can imagine using this section as a drill and exercise tool.

Finally, there is Combination instruction of 30 min, which you can also play with practice music. And an 8 min yoga-based cool-down. And performances.

I suppose it figures that if you put three freakin' hours of material onto one DVD (runtime is 180 minutes, no joke), you're going to please a lot of people. Asharah is relaxed and straightforward on the video, and there is really just so much material to work with, at such different levels, that it's an incredible value. I think people who are actually *into* tribal fusion will probably adore this video, although they might find the isolations section a little basic. However, even people who are not can use this DVD as a dance training video, rather than a dance instruction video. The actual dance section makes up 30 minutes out of 3 hours -- the rest is really a conditioning program for dancers.",1203984000,78,3787,4.725757575757576
2928039,5,B000UZRT4A,"This DVD is DEFINITELY a keeper! Asharah provides very sharp clear instructions on how to execute each movement while detailing the body mechanics involved.

Movements are presented at various levels of intensity providing challenge and range for growth. I will definitely be utilizing the DVD for a long time to come!

Throughout the choreography and instruction sequences, the music utilized is perfectly synchronized with each movement and isolation allowing the dancer to feel more deeply into the movement.

The DVD is flawlessly broken down so that you can select each segment from the menu. The segments are then further broken down so that you can select each movement taught within a segment individually for review. Combinations are demonstrated and then instructions are broken down and provided with and without music.

Choreography is fantastic and the performances are nothing less than mesmerizing.

I strongly recommend this DVD!!",1203638400,9,946,5.4520547945205475
2928040,5,B000UZRT4A,"Asharah's DVD is my absolute top choice among all of my Belly Dance DVD's. I recommend it to all of my students for their home practice. Most valuable is the isolations section where she explains the moves expertly then drills them with various level changes and footing. I think this DVD is really inspiring for beginning dancers, and is a great motivator for experienced as well. Highly, highly recommend.",1306800000,2,407,4.913043478260869
2928041,5,B000UZRT4A,"This is my conditioning workout. I'm still building up the muscles and flexibility, after years of nondancing. I use the opening section on this dvd, Warm Up and Conditioning (45 minutes) every other day, and I really notice a difference. I've been alternating this disk with Sadie's Complete Bellydance workout, and trying to build up to a longer workout time. So far, after four weeks, my workouts are up to roughly an hour. (My goal is to get to 90 minutes and then two hours.) I highly recommend this affordable dvd for anyone with some dance, gymnastic, or other physical training, as an excellent starting point to get serious about learning the beautiful, mysterious, and joyful art of bellydance. For the complete beginner, I recommend Amira's Bellydance 101. Asharah is a lovely, down to earth, and knowledgeable instructor. Her approach is rigorous and serious, and she doesn't baby the beginner. Please, as always, exercise caution in trying moves which look or feel ""too hard."" Always stop and modify if you feel any unusual discomfort, or if you can't hold a position or attain a movement. That said, I wholeheartedly recommend this dvd, along with Ariellah's, for the beginner with some dance or exercise experience who is interested in the modern tribal style of bellydance. Happy dancing!",1305590400,3,1304,5.041666666666667
2928042,5,B000UZRT4A,"First, I should say that I was a student of Asharah's in DC for 2 years. I bought this DVD when she moved, and she still kicks my butt! At first I hated drills. Yet after 6 months of weekly classes with her, I noticed that I was able to do moves and combos I couldn't before, and I had better muscle control. No matter what style of dance you are interested in, Asharah will improve how your brain and body cooperate on and off the dance floor. I've read some criticisms in other reviews about her timing with stretching and rehearsing moves. Come on, people. You know your bodies and where the pause button is. When it comes down to it, her exercises will strengthen your dance, regardless of the structure of this DVD.",1296777600,3,720,4.340740740740741
2928043,5,B000UZRT4A,"I love this DVD.  If you can do this video, you don't really need to purchase much else.  I agree this is not for beginners or those unfamiliar with dance.  You should have some background or be prepared to study seriously.  I LOVE THIS DVD!!!! I felt like I could do almost anything after this.  It provided lots of information and material.  The warm-ups and techniques were superb.  As an inter-disciplinary dancer, this did the trick.  I learned sooo much and I have taken classes at FCBD.  I haven't seen many more DVDs that really cover this amount of material and so thoroughly.  I suggest you get this DVD and skip a lot of the rest.  If you are a beginner, take your time.  It will come.  The techniques she shows also helped with other belly dance moves I could not get until now.  I don't think I can say enough to really convey my ""devotion"" to this DVD.  LOVE IT !!!!!!!",1296259200,,883,4.364197530864198
2928044,3,B000UZRT4A,"I like this dancer.but watching her DVD is really not easy to figure out how to do the belly dance. You have to keep pausing and pausing and pausing. In combination section, there is no time between combinations for you to practice. Does she expect leaners to remember all at once?

Plus when she is talking about right, actually she means your left; vice versa.",1257897600,,362,4.569230769230769
2928045,2,B000UZRT4A,"I bought this and another bellydancing tutorial dvd and have seen several clips on youtube and things online, frankly I wasn't too jazzed about watching this one. It was very dull and difficult to follow her instructions. While she is beautiful and very talented, I wouldn't recommend this dvd to learn tribal fusion.",1257552000,,317,5.0
2928046,5,B000UZRT4A,I am trained in egyptian bellydance. I had read the previous reviews and decided to give this a try. These drills will make you an awesome dancer no matter what form your dancing. I have no interest in learning tribal dancing but this was an great intro to the movement. You will sweat. I have the Michele Joyce videos. Which I love. If you like her. I would suggest her pop and lock drill video with this and you will be set for a long time.,1256083200,3,442,4.151162790697675
2928047,5,B000UZRT4A,"This DVD is a really great all-included workout, technique and drill program, and ""creativity enhancement device."" You learn some of the unique bits of Asharah's dance style, plus you have a really SERIOUS work out that will actually get you into shape. Of all the dance DVDs I've bought, so far this one is my favorite.
She has a really easy-going way of teaching, not too clinical, but not too ""friendly,"" either.
If you can't make it all the way through the workout the first time you watch it, don't worry. That's a fairly normal response.
Great DVD.",1255651200,,554,4.663265306122449
2928048,5,B000UZRT4A,"Asharah's  Tribal Belly dance DVD is the foremost, most comprehensive belly dance workout I have encountered. I've studied dance for many years, have been in two dance companies in my lifetime. This workout is so complete and ""hits"" every muscle group. Focusing on muscle isolation training that is so important to any dance form. I love, love, love the rigorous routines that really make you workout and gives the desired results. Thank YOU, Asharah! You are Prima-Tribal Dancer!",1254700800,,480,5.153846153846154
2928049,5,B000UZRT4A,"I just purchased 3 tribal bellydance DVDs: this one, Ariella's and Rachel Brice's. Asharah's is the best of the three by far, fallowed by Ariella's.
Asharah is great to watch as she is not only an amazing dancer as she speaks very clearly and knows how to explain the movements very well. The production isn't elaborate, but that's a plus because there is nothing to distract attention from the instruction.
The DVD is very long, a lot of material that will keep you busy practicing for a long time. I decided to try one part at a time until I'm happy with my progress before moving along to the next. I'm happy with this purchase and plan on reccommending it to other bellydancers I know.",1253059200,3,689,4.52
2928050,5,B000UZRT4A,"I don't know how it works for folks who don't have a dance foundation; however, I found this to be one of the most useful interfaces to the belly dance world I have ever purchased (and I am a fitness/dance DVD collector).  Asharah is not only a wonderful, nuanced dancer ( I love the performance section) but also a phenomenal instructor.  Very few instructors can give you the proper verbal cues to execute variations in movement.  She gives verbal cues AND she demonstrates the technique through stellar articulation of her movements.  She is really precise and controlled, and the best part as an instructor: she can explain it all.  This is the best DVD I have purchased on tribal bellydance, and I have WorldDance videos from a number of instructors.

The drills can seem boring at first.  It is important to stick with them.  The ""strobing"" effect of tribal is minute; that means lots of time spent on minute details for the dancer. However, Asharah is so personal and up-close, with such excellent explanations, that this is, for me, the equivalent of a modern tribal bellydance class (and dancers know that classes are repetitive from week to week) in person.  An awesome purchase, well done Asharah!

Finally, it is a joy to see a woman with a belly doing belly dance.  Asharah is exquisitely feminine and her stomach is not the ripped-toned six-pack of so many of today's fitness and Hollywood stars.  Every move resonates on her flesh in a total sensual manner.  This is how women are supposed to look...and move! It is extremely mesmerizing to watch her dance!",1251158400,4,1572,4.777777777777778
2928051,5,B000UZRT4A,"When I first got this DVD, and saw the very beginning segment, I thought I would hate it and put it aside. However, a friend who had also bought it recommended it when I said I was having trouble with chest isolations and 3/4 shimmies.

In the Techniques and Isolations section Asharah breaks down just about every basic belly dance move. She explains it very well, then begins, slowly, faster, then very fast. My chest isolations have improved, and while I am still not up to speed on the 3/4 shimmy, but I AM doing better.

I have not been able to ""do"" the whole DVD start to finish (3+ hours !), but I have done nearly all of the Techniques and isolations section in one session.

At first, I did not appreciate what one reviewer called her ""robotic"" dance/look, but I do now. Her control and precision is really nice. While most people wouldn't consider belly dance to be a ""precision"" discipline, Asharah demonstrates how well precision can work.

If you are looking for a DVD to just sort of put in, and work on some of your basic techniques, this is a very good one to use.",1250380800,,1080,4.4120603015075375
2928052,5,B000UZRT4A,"Other reviewers have mentioned how this DVD has an insane amount of content, so I don't need to go into that. Other things I appreciate:

High production values. There aren't many (any?) cuts from camera to camera in the workout segments, and those that are there make sense rather than chopping up the flow of what's being presented. The space is ample but not distracting with plain backgrounds and without cheesy props. The sound is crisp. The images are crisp.

Asharah is an excellent instructor with a really pleasant, relaxing, natural presence. She doesn't seem to be reciting canned lines and she's not reading off a teleprompter (or trying to be cute, or artificially enthusiastic). It's easy to imagine I'm in a class or workshop she's addressing. Her instructions are clear, although one or two movements in the warmup segment are introduced without as much instruction as I'd like, so the first couple times I did the workout I had to muddle along until I picked it up.

The segments are conveniently divided so I don't have to fast-forward through the warmup, say, if I want the technique workout, or do the warmup and then fast-forward through the whole techniques segment and the choreography instruction to get to the cool-down. I don't even have to sit through a corny screen with transitional muzak or anything between segments. It's streamlined and efficient.

I'm not sure what's up with the strange bright green screen, and I could wish for some modifications to be offered for the more advanced conditioning exercises, but that's about it. Overall, this was an excellent investment, especially considering that I can't imagine outgrowing it.",1249948800,5,1664,5.018115942028985
2928053,5,B000UZRT4A,"This is a great DVD, its fairly intense, at an intermediate belly dance level. The workout alone is great. Asharah breaks steps down and slowly progresses the steps into combinations. Great DVD and worth the money!",1248739200,,214,4.972222222222222
2928054,5,B000UZRT4A,"If you have money just enough for one belly dance DVD and you want to do some workout by way of belly dance, this is the very one I would highly recommend.

Asharah is not a beauty, nor has she got an exotic figure but her teaching skill and techniques are magnificent. In addition, it is a very well planned and presented DVD. It is extremely interesting, user-friendly, very informative and very much worth the money. For the past week, I have kept practicing on her DVD without getting even slightly bored.

The warm up and conditioning section is already 45 minutes, sufficient to replace my usual workout. It includes stretching the neck, hips and legs and working on shoulders, upper ab, glute, legs and undulation. Oh, there are even press-ups for both chests and triceps. For a few times, I have to pause and drink water. There is also yoga to open up hips in particular and some ballet movements.

The technique section is excellent. I had written in my own blog about a very good DVD ""Contemporary Bellydance & Yoga Conditioning by Areillah"", my another favourite teacher. However I had fallen asleep a few times during her practice (when I was tired and sleepy) because for every movement I had to do for 30 times and as a result I got bored. (Having said that, it is still a great DVD.) Asharah's practice is totally different. I have to sometimes raise my heel, or raise my leg, or raise both heels while doing the same practice. As a result, I cannot fall asleep but instead I find it a great challenge. How can I dance on one leg? I wobble a lot. What is more interesting about this DVD is it has a 30 minutes' tribal dance movement section, which I find immensely interesting. We have to pause sharply before we move on to the next part of one single move. As a result, my muscles have to be very strong in order to give that kind of movement. Oh, I do LOVE this DVD, in particular it is a gift by my kids. In addition, Asharah's performances are really a treat to watch! I have been too busy to do the choreography practice yet.

After less than one week, I found my upper ab, lower ab and arms toned up significantly, which made me so proud of my body shape.

It is highly recommended to even beginners as anyone can follow the very clear instructions. I feel so grateful for such a high-quality DVD to have been produced.",1247356800,,2340,4.419953596287703
2928055,5,B000UZRT4A,"In this 180 minute instruction DVD, you get expert and detailed training by internationally acclaimed  teacher and dancer Asharah, who demonstrates with precision and explains with clarity every movement. Tribal Fusion is difficult as it takes controlled strength and suppleness. I find in watching Asharah, it's her back that always amazes me. It has the strength of steel and the fluidity of a lava lamp.

This DVD begins with a ""Welcome,"" then a 45 minute intensive warm-up, strengthening and stretching for what lies ahead.  It is followed by  a 55 minute tutorial of traditional belly dance techniques, and then 30 minutes of the robotic movements that make up the modern tribal style. This section has to be practiced a lot! You have to have excellent muscle control to master these movements.

The dance combination is broken down into 6 sections for easy learning of the choreography, which is a mix of modern tribal and classic belly dance. Finally there is an 8 minute delicious yoga based ""Cool Down"" to relax and stretch out your muscles. Asharah is very agile but we can do these movements at our own level of flexibility, and benefit a lot.

There are 2 performances where we get to see Asharah in costume and showing us her grace and artistry.  The music used on the DVD is by Maduro, Cdatakill, Venetian Snares, and Hecate. The production is good and well lit, on a bare stage in front of a green curtain (except for 2nd performance when it is red). If you want to learn the technique of modern tribal fusion dance, you can't do better than this DVD.",1237420800,3,1566,4.735294117647059
2928056,5,B000UZRT4A,"I didn't really expect to break a sweat while working through this video, but it was challenging, in a good way.

Very inspiring!",1236643200,,325,4.75
2928057,5,B000UZRT4A,"This DVD is so meaty you will be using it for quite awhile.  This is also a tough workout!  Usually after the warm-up and conditioning I am ready for a snack ;-)  I don't think this video is appropriate for someone who doesn't have an exercise routine already because even the warm up requires stamina.  I love all the content packed into this DVD.  I appreciate the section on the short ticking movements.  This is something I haven't encountered in another DVD.  The drills are challenging enough to keep me busy but not hard enough that I give up.  I'm trying to think of something I don't like on this video and there really isn't anything.  She is a bit stiff (in speech, not in her dancing) in front of the camera it seems but it doesn't affect the work you are doing.  This is another video that is completely worth the money.",1236384000,2,833,4.38562091503268
2928058,5,B000UZRT4A,"In english:
This is an excellent DVD and I strongly recommend it; it achieve perfectly his goal which is to provide a technique practice companion and a guide to developing skills.
Asharah did a great job with this very complete program , explaining very clearly the technique with all the information needed on what muscle to use, body alignment, where to place weight, do's & don't... The ""technique and isolation section"" is easy to understand but it's a working hard program. I especially liked the way of every move is worked with changes on weight and level. I also really liked the ""modern tribal technique section"" where I could finally bare secrets on how to do some robotic moves. I enjoyed a lot the choreagraphy and the performance at the end of the DVD.
Asharah is an awesome dancer, elegant, precise, gracefull with energy and power. I hope that there will be another DVD from her in the near future.

En franais:
Le propos de ce DVD est d'tre un outil d'entranement pour faire travailler la technique des diffrentes isolations utilises dans la danse orientale tribale fusion par des sries d'exercices, mais galement d'tre un guide ou comment dvelopper son adresse et son vocabulaire
Voil un excellent DVD, je le recommande vivement.
Asharah explique de faon claire er concise la technique mais aussi ce qu'il faut faire et ne pas faire, les muscles sollicits, le placement du poids du corps, etc...
La partie  ""technique and isolation section"" est facile  comprendre mais nanmoins vous travaillerez dur. J'ai spcialement aim la faon don't les diffrents mouvements taient travaills avec des changements de niveaux et de placements du poids du corps.
La partie  modern tribal technique section  vous fera dcouvrir enfin la technique pour avoir des mouvements dans le style robotique.
Et enfin j'ai t merveille par la grce, la matrise, la prcision, l'nergie d'Asharah dans les 2 performances  la fin du DVD.
J'espre vivement qu'un autre DVD d'Asharah suivra dans le futur, je suis conquise.

Aqu tenemos un excelente DVD que se propone de hacernos trabajar la tcnica de la danza tribal fusin con varios ejercicios, pero tambin nos gua para que podamos desarrollar nuestras aptitudes y nuestro propio vocabulario.
Lo recomiendo absolutamente.
Asharah explica de forma muy clara y precisa la tcnica pero tambin y es muy importante las cosas que hacer y no hacer, donde poner el peso del cuerpo, que muslos se solicitan...
La parte  ""technique and isolation section"" es sencilla de entender pero hace trabajar bastante duro. Me ha gustado mucho la forma de trabajar los movimientos con cambio de nivel y del peso del cuerpo.
En la parte  modern tribal technique section  se descubre como hacer los movimientos como un robot.
Y finalmente he sido encantada por la gracia, la maestra, la precisin, la energa de Asharah en los 2 bailes al fin de DVD.

2928059,3,B000UZRT4A,I purchased this to see what fusion dancing looked like. Very long dvd. Very good for practice strength and drilling the basic moves. My arms got the best work out. NO pops and locks. Good for muscle memory. NIce warm up. If You are looking to get an idea about tribual fusion and a workout this will be a nice selection.,1233964800,3,321,4.278688524590164
2928060,4,B000UZRT4A,"This is a great intro to Tribal DVD...If you have the time to put towards it.  It runs about 3 hours total.  It is very complete, dealing with basic posture, traditional belly dance moves, and transitioning to tribal style and robotics for those serious and hardcore. And I do like her style of dance.

On the down side...it's length, which I already commented on.  Also, the instruction and dance is against a green and red back ground, which is very harsh on the eyes after long periods of time.  And one other problem that I am not sure is characteristic to my personal dvd player, or a particular batch of dvds made at one time...I have played two of these same dvds on my dvd player, and BOTH have skipped or stalled on my system, even when brand new and out of the package.  Because of its length, I am still able to get much out of the dvds, but the skipping and stalling does get in the way.

I give Asharah and her material a 5 star, but give the quality of the dvd from a mechanical point of view a 2.",1233360000,,1011,4.2072538860103625
2928061,5,B000UZRT4A,"First off, for those who have never seen Asharah dance in person, it is a gem.  I knew her from when I danced in the DC area, and so when I heard about the DVD, it automatically went on my ""must have"" list.
It is now on my ""students must have"" list.  This DVD is best suited for those with some bellydance background. I also would not recommend it for a beginner dance student with severe lower back problems, only because of the amount of plie's on it that can be hard on the lower back unless supervised.
The DVD is outstanding, and even more outstanding for the cost.  There is a 45 minute warmup section, a 55 minute technique section, a 30 minute Modern Tribal section, and a 30 minute combination instruction. This is followed by a combinations drill and cooldown.
I am lucky if I make it through the warmup section. The warmup is shoulder and thigh strength intense, and I find myself sweating profusely by the end, and my legs crying out for mercy.  If you are interested in Suhaila format, Asharah's training in the format is apparent.  Squats, plies, plies in releve, shoulder rolls, tribal style rippling arms, shoulder rolls and rippling arms while in a plie releve, etc. This woman is incredible.
The technique section has a great dance posture explanation, and a fantastic hip work on the down/hip work on the up/hipword down up and in releve explanation. Again, if you are thinking of SSSD certification, this DVD is fantastic preparation, or if you are a teacher who teaches the 3/4 shimmy flat footed, learning it one-footed in releve is a great new vocabulary for you.  Also, if you have unattractive arms when you dance, this DVD is great in it's drilling of keeping the hands  and pretty as you dance.
The combinations presented use walking, interior and exterior hip circles, chest lifts with locks, level changes, 3/4 shimmys with a turn, hip drops with locks, undulations down to up and up to down with level changes, slow turns, and ticking.
Asharah is easy to hear, the lighting ambient and pleasant, and the sound is good.  Another reviewer did not like the fact you cannot see her feet because of the flare pants, which I did not notice until she said it--again, this is more for the intermediate and advanced dancer, for the foot placement falls under basic dance steps.
The performance does not do credit to Asharah's incredible stage power, which is best seen, as with all dancers, in person.  However, the performance does not disappoint.
A fantastic value for the price.",1230508800,2,2502,4.681093394077449
2928062,4,B000UZRT4A,"Let me start with a preface statement: I have watched a LOT of Tribal Fusion DVDs, instructional and performance, in the last 3 years, and most have been unimpressive. In fact, most of the TF genre bores me to death. A bunch of teensy twentysomethings slavishly imitating Rachel Brice tick for tick, ornament for ornament, standing in place doing tiny little versions of breakdancing moves from the 1980's, posing oh-so-dramatically, and calling themselves ""revolutionary""... give me a break. One more pretentious twit in pigtails and I'm gonna hang up my tassel belt.

However, this DVD is head and shoulders above the cowrie-clone crowd. Though the instructor is as Brice-like in performance as the rest of the TF girls, this gal has CHOPS. I was attracted to this DVD because of its length and because of the extremely thorough coverage of technique. Two-plus hours of drills and movement breakdown. Even if you're not into TF dance, this is a really, really good workout for any bellydancer. She does things with her hips that I can't do after 10 years of Cabaret classes, and that impressed me. I found it to be challenging, which inspired me to keep doing it. Though, not all at once. You do this DVD full-out and you're going to be VERY sore.

Her performance is nothing earth-shattering in the world of TF dance -- isn't everybody copying the Burlesque thing now anyway? -- but she is a good, solid dancer with some animation in her choreography. Level changes and etc. Doesn't just stand there looking like she's taking herself too seriously. And it's the same with her persona during instruction. She is animated, friendly, clear, and concise, and she knows her technique. I didn't get the feeling that I was being talked down to by a twelve-year-old as I have with a number of other TF DVDs.

The only drawback is the production quality. For the most part she is on a blank marley-floor stage, standing in front of a green screen, and the lighting makes her skin look almost fuschia. After awhile it's very distracting. That's a big problem with these World Dance NY videos, so I took away one star. But otherwise, this DVD is WELL worth the money.

If you're like me and choose to ""dabble"" in TF to get a couple of slinky choreography ideas to use in bellydance class, then you will be pleasantly surprised with the quality workout you get in this DVD. Definitely worth buying, and exploring. If you did this workout every day you'd be in killer condition in no time.",1228867200,10,2479,4.731481481481482
2928063,5,B000UZRT4A,"This instructional video makes tribal-style belly dance accessible to those who may be ""freaked"" out by other videos.  Ashara's broad and extensive dance training is evident in both her instruction and performances She is proof that you do not have tattoo yourself up or have dreads to be an intriguing tribal fusionist.  Her instructions are clear and broken down into manageable bits. The section on ticking is unlike anything I have seen in other videos, and her explanations of more traditional moves is refreshing. Her warm up is a workout in itself and is yoga inspired without getting wu-wu.  The only drawback is the production quality, but that seems to be typical of this company.

With 3 hours of material, it will keep you busy!",1223510400,2,740,4.896
2928064,5,B000UZRT4A,"There are some great detailed reviews here already (thankyou bellydancing community for taking the time - you are all fabulous!)
I agree with what everyone else is saying - the three star and the five stars! I guess it depends on what you want, and serious drilling was it for me. But absolutely - be warned, she is strong and flexible and I for one cannot do her warmup without making modifications, which she doesn't give you. If you have done some yoga I think you could work it out for yourself. I agree this is probably not for beginners, this is to hone your skills.
I do like the format that WDNY is using on their dvd's - you know you will get a good menu with warm-up, drill/technique, combos, performance...and this one is really long, and great value. Can someone with influence please get these producers to start using detailed breakdown and matrix option like they do with modern yoga dvd's? That way you could take the sections you like of asharah's and make few different half hour workout's....
If you like the style, then I'm sure you will get something useful out of the dvd.",1221782400,3,1094,4.53030303030303
2928065,5,B000UZRT4A,"Other reviews have covered how great the workout is, and how clear the instruction is.  I love the way Ashara combines the smooth buttery moves with the locking and ticking.  She blends them into a textural experience.  That said, even if you don't like the way the dance looks, this will increase your muscle/body control.  I loved the performances and the workout.",1218240000,4,366,4.854838709677419
2928066,3,B000UZRT4A,"A friend of mine wanted me to check this video out.  I have been dancing for about ten years--I don't do tribal, so I was kinda curious to see what this style was all about.

Asharah, let me say right off the bat, is one SERIOUSLY in shape lady. Your shoulders will be killing you if you even think of doing the whole video in a straight run through. (I do Lebanese--we don't hold our arms forward as much--ouchie!)

However, she doesn't seem to have any real credentials in exercise physiology, and that leads me to say: use this video with reasonable caution, and modify whenever and wherever you need. (She offers no modifications).  She makes you do full head circles--when most physical trainers say to avoid the back-half-circle as too compressing to the neck bones.  Most dangerous, she actually has you do 'diamond pushups' (I don't recall what she calls them--when you put your hands right under your chest, your fingers forming a diamond).  Even the Army has stopped doing these--they are way too hard on the elbows to justify the risk.

She'll lead you on a serious (murderous, I would say) chain of exercise, like a bunch of tribal arm waves (kinda like Snake Arms but not), but then not have you stretch at all between sets--THAT's when I need a neck-roll! And for all the bent-knee, you never stretch your quads.

She teaches a small vocabulary of movements, with basic 'locking' (as in 'pop and lock'), and has a nice useful drill segment on those.
What makes it distracting is that half the time she's off the beat.  I thought it was just me, but I watched both of her performances, where I was just on my butt and counting, and, yeah, she missed the downbeat quite frequently--less so on the 'lock' movements, but anytime the music drifted, so did she.  I did half of the drills with my eyes closed counting to myself.

It's physically a very demanding video, and you will definitely sweat! If I were a beginner, though, I'd have some serious problems learning the moves from her--her pants are long and cover her feet and the lighting makes it hard to see her knees, and seeing only a front angle made it hard to understand what she meant by some moves--is 'up' straight up or diagonal up on a chest lift?

Unless you're already a good dancer, looking for some super-challenging skill-building drills, I'd avoid this video.  If you want to learn basics, look to the gold standard--Delilah's Belly Dance Workshop. If you're budget minded, check out any of Neon's videos. Sure she dresses crazazy, but she can explain the moves better--even the locking.  However, if you want to get your dancing butt kicked, and you are at least an intermediate dancer, this video will keep you occupied and really refine your technique.",1218240000,39,2737,4.675
2928067,5,B000UZRT4A,"I agree with the above reviews that this tape has incomparable warmup, drills, and combinations.  However, I would like to comment on Asharah's exquisite dance performances.  She is clearly based in classical Egyptian and Turkish styles, as well as tribal styles, and the fusion gives a real depth to her performances.  This can also be seen in her two performances on the Gothic Bellydance video.  Her arm and hand movements are a beautiful fusion of all of these styles.",1214611200,5,472,4.936708860759493
2928068,5,B000UZRT4A,"I don't have much to add except that I am very pleased with this DVD. With all the good ones out there, (the customer reviews are very  helpful) it is difficult to fit them all in a day, or even a week. I thought I had everything I needed for my daily routines, but I just had to squeeze in the conditioning section, it is that good. I do Sera's warmup, Ariellah's drills, and Rachel's arms  every morning. I do Asharah's conditioning workout and Michelle's drills in the afternoon and I do Blanca's ""Sensual Belly Dance"" and Jehan's ""Sacred Belly dance"" in the evenings. I have a lot more DVDs for technique and choreography but the ones I mentioned I do religiously. This DVD has really rounded out my daily routine and I love it. I like the technique section, but I have not had time to look at the choreography. I already have enough tribal fusion from the other DVDs but I will definitely check it out, because I am always looking for things I can use.",1210982400,2,957,4.370786516853933
2928069,5,B000UZRT4A,"Halfway through Asharah's workout and technique drills, I begin to have decidedly sugary fantasies. They quickly progress to vivid hypnotic images of soft sweet sponge cake oozing with caramel sauce...

Asharah's 3-hour video on isolation drills, a strength workout and six combinations is solid hard work - make no mistake about that. But I, for one, love it.

If you're looking for a few quick and cool combos to do on the dance floor, this is the wrong video. This one is about getting a dancer's body, her strength, her flexibility, stamina, and most of all, her precision. Nope, this video isn't for anyone looking for a quick fix. It's for the determined belly dancer to whom every component of a muscle isolation matters.

In this, the 6th tribal fusion instructional DVD to come out of World Dance New York, the conditioning and isolation exercises have been taken to another level altogether. These sections add up to 130 minutes with 60 minutes given to learning six combinations -- and there are two performances. If you're wondering about value for money, there's your answer. There's a mind-boggling amount of content for very little money.

I won't describe the strength and conditioning section because it's been adequately described everywhere else. But I can tell you that I've been working with it and found some difference in a matter of two sessions. I felt the effect on a) my range of movement b) sharpness and ability to break an isolation down into 8 parts c) stamina and strength d) balance. As I continue with this workout, I hope the next step will be to develop the ability to make each part of an isolation really distinct and visible. Working with this video fits right into my approach. I like working hard at the preparation and I totally revel in seeing the difference. I have the tribal videos to thank for where my muscle isolations have reached so far, and am grateful that this instruction seems to be improving on that.

One new development in Asharah's video is her 30-minute amazing section on breaking down movements into tick-tock precise parts. In tribal fusion, you can use those to get that automated robotic look which is visible in this sometimes wacky genre. But if you don't want to dance that way (and I don't) you still end up with perfect control to use with any style. Some of Asharah's exercises will have you doing very controlled movements standing on your toes! Or on one foot! Tht makes you less dependant on cheating with your feet and instead actually using the muscles you're supposed to.

I haven't got to the combinations yet but plan on working with them because they're the most challenging of all the 6 tribal fusion videos (all of which I have). I tend to use the combinations as exercises and drills in themselves and dance more in the oriental style.

Overall, this is a mammoth treasure house of a video. Sometimes, I feel outright grateful for a video - and this is one of those times.

But I have to confess I've sometimes eaten a Mars bar in the middle of it.",1206403200,33,3032,4.7075471698113205

8215958,5,B000UZRT4A,"WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ Instruction quality - every drill is clearly explained anatomically and stylistically. Suitable also for beginners.
+ Conditioning - This segment is really tough to help you condition your muscles. This is the best muscle conditioning segment within BD DVDs that I own.
+ Drills - Every move is drilled extensively at different speeds. The drills are tough and really help you improve. I love the drilling in this DVD, I use this DVD at least once per week and I am getting better. (P.D. After a couple of months I would say these drills are the best I own to really improve your condition).
+ Drills - I cannot overemphasize how good the drills in this DVD are.

Maybe this is the best exercising video I own withing the bellydance genre. What I mean is that the warm-up  & conditioning segment is for me an entire workout session on its own (45 min.). It is tough regarding the toning part (mainly yoga poses) while already introducing you to some basic bellydance isolations. Then there is the technique & drilling section (55 min.) which is also a tough workout on its own. It consists in drilling exercises for each body part that will tone your muscles and ingrain the moves in your muscle memory to bring your skills to the next level. Since the whole DVD is aimed at teaching you to bellydance with robotic precision, I thought it would be for more advanced dancers, but the first two sections are excellent for beginners. As a beginner you will need to work on the technique section a lot to get the movements right and at the speed Asharah is doing it (in fact as a beginner you will not be able to do it, but stick to it). With practise I assure you, all the rest of the BD DVDs will seem easier.

Regarding drills, I own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contemporary-Belly-Dance-and-Yoga-with-Ariellah-Tribal-fusion-bellydance-classes-Belly-dance-fitness-workout-and-yoga-instruction-Beginner-intermediate/dp/B000KZRP12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Bellydance-with-Rachel-Brice-TWO-DVD-SET-Complete-belly-dancing-instructional-program-Belly-dancing-classes-with-yoga-How-to-in-Rachel-s-tribal-style-belly-dance-including-full-choreographies/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine: Bellydance with Rachel Brice (TWO-DVD SET): Complete belly dancing instructional program, Belly dancing classes with yoga, How-to in Rachel's tribal style belly dance, including full choreographies</a>&nbsp;(best layered shimmy section I own). Personally I think Asharah's drills (and her tough conditioning section) helped me improve very fast and when I used Ariellah's DVD, both drill levels included seemed fairly easy with some exceptions. I am not quite sure that had I owned and drilled with Ariellah's DVD first, if Asharah's would seem easy, I do not think so.  Asharah increases the tempo more, challenges your balance and conditions you for level changes and makes more ""punctuated"" and sharp moves. On the other hand, during the vertical figure 8's up-to-down (mayas) and down-to-up (taxseem) drills, Ariellah gives a few tips regarding tucking the pelvis and weight placement that definitely helped mine looked much much better and effortless in just one session! The achievement of beautiful movement through excellent technique shows you Ariellah's extensive ballet background. If I could only get one drilling DVD, I would probably get Asharah's (because you get more fitness benefits and muscle control from it, and my main goal is to have a fun body conditioning routine while learning to dance), but if your goal is beauty and artistry you might get more out of Ariellah's DVD. Better yet, purchase Ariellah's DVD first, so you learn and drill beautiful form from the beginning, then you can move up to Asharah's.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Moderate  TONING: High  CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate  DRILLS: Challenging both in terms of speed & precision and in terms of balance (core & leg strength); easy in terms of layering INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent  MUSIC: Industrial (robotic), not really my choice, but goes well with the routines. All the drills are performed to the same tune.  FUN FACTOR: Medium - It's drilling, so it's not really for fun, but it is not boring either.

CONTENT:
1) Warm-up and conditioning (45 min.) - Excellent conditioning using several yoga poses, athletic stretches and bellydance drilling. The only thing that I found strange is that Asharah does not perform core strengthening exercises. If you really want to be able to do all the drills on one foot and on releve that she does in her technique section (the greatest balance challenge I have seen in any BD DVD), you definitely need a strong core. For this I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Basic-3-DVD-Workout-Set-Basics-Step-By-Step-20-Minute-Workout-Accelerated-Body-Sculpting/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Basic 3 DVD Workout Set (Basics Step-By-Step/20 Minute Workout/Accelerated Body Sculpting)</a>, only after training with this program was I able to improve my balance, even though I do not really like the workout itself...
2) Technique drilling (55 min.) - The more I do this section, the more I like it. All the drills in this DVD are tough in terms of exercising but they are explained carefully and at slow speed. Each isolation is drilled at different speeds, on one leg and on releve, so every specific isolation is drilled individually and extensively. On the other hand, there is no layering in this DVD, so in fact you'll master the basic drills with precision & speed. If you would like to drill your layering or your shimmies (other than the 3/4 up & down) you need to look somewhere else.
3) Modern tribal concepts and technique drilling (30 min.) - This section is a bit more advanced; I gave it a try when I bought the DVD and although it's clearly explained and just a matter of practise, for the start I preferred to stick to the first two sections (which are already worth your money and then you can ""grow"" to the next parts). Once you feel more or less comfortable with the ""technique and drilling"" section, the modern tribal concepts flow almost naturally.
4) Choreography breakdown and practise. I like these choreography very much and the music, which I thought would be unbearable, is more or less ok, except for some very unpleasant noises that are introduced every now and then, but not in the full piece, unlike in the performance sections where these noises are much more present. This choreography consists of six combinations each containing three 8-counts. This is the same length as other choreographies, only this one seems of intermediate difficulty, having quite some popping and ticking, some travelling and turns as well as some arm movements, although it has few shimmies and almost no 8-counts on relevee.
5) Two Performances by Asharah, one is a bit faster than the other.
6) Cool down (8 min). The cooldown is not one of my favorites but it is effective; it consists mainly of sitting stretches.

MUSIC: Industrial (robotic). The electronic beats in the conditioning and technique sections really help your drilling. I would not play the music on my own but it is useful and not disturbing. I was doubtful of buying the DVD because of the music in the trailer, but it's tolerable. The only part where it is really disturbing is in the performance by Ashara (which is the one that shows up in the trailer).

EMPHASIS:
Perfecting your technique to obtain robotic precision, so a lot of drills and toning to get fast and precise moves.",1361664000,,7953,5.52506162695152

8215960,5,B000UZRT4A,"Keep in mind I haven't went through the whole video except to quickly view the material. I very much liked the drills in the warm up section. However I did not like the random yoga thrown in I twisted my kneee and hurt my back trying to do the sun salutation. She doesn't really say out loud what she's doing so I was trying to do the pose while still watching the video. Not a good mixture. I do like that she has more bellyfat than alot of the bellydancers in videos have. I have kids and my tummy fat doesn't move like the skinny girls so the moves wind up looking very different. I did like that the warmup left me slightly sweaty. A workout and drilling all in one. For some of the warm up moves you would move into position and by the time she's through explaining it all your legs are tired and you've already fallen over. However I do think the warmup is based on her warmup so it's something to be built up on out of repetition. I also like how the video is 2 hours long however it is all in one clip so if you want to skip a particular warmup it's pretty hard. Also, within the first 10 minutes my arms were killing me. Which was good however it makes it hard to hold them up when you really need to. She holds hers up for every move. I guess that's something to be worked on too. The instruction on strobing and ticking is good as far as I can tell. However her demonstrations leave something to be desired. There's no passion and the locks are not sharp. Could be that she was tired by now because I believe that she did the whole 2 hours together instead of doing parts on different days. This could be very good basic information and you fill in the blanks.  I don't see the years of dedication that you see in Rachel Brice or some of the others. Her moves are very generic, but again the ticking, drills, and warmup make it a good add on to your collection of bellydance videos. I believe I got my moneys worth, but don't expect really great new stuff unless you're just starting out in bellydance. Her performances are also some of the worst I've seen short of newbies. There's very little attitude or basic bellydance. She flows more than moves, even when she's trying to tick or lock. Her second performance looks very much like a watered down copy of Kami's on Bellydance Fundamentals.

Update 3/7/13: After having this and several other dvds for over a year, this one has become the one I turn to the most. I still have yet to have been all the way through the dvd, but I focus mainly on the conditioning. I want to perfect and build that muscle and the memory before moving on. Her conditioning section is THE best I have found. Less than 10 min into it your arms are dying and your waist is starting to burn. I still believe her style lacks flair, but for learning basics and speeding up those basics she is top notch.",1329264000,,2840,4.2380073800738005
