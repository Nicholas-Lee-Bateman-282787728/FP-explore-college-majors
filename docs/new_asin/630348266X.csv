660682,5,630348266X,"If you're looking for the reason why so many Doctor Who fans love the Pertwee years look no further than this superlative seven part story.  Jon Pertwee is at this finest, and Malcolm Hulke's scripts have never been better.  The entire regular cast does great jobs, showing that when done right, longer Doctor Who stories can be done well.  There's easily enough plot here for ten episodes.  And it's got the color restored. 'Nuff said.  END",895104000,,441,4.75
7848270,5,630348266X,"This serial is one of my favorites within the original Doctor Who production of video stories. Back in the 1960s to the 1980s Doctor Who on video was much different than it is nowadays. The serials tended to be longer and were composed of several parts at first called ""episodes"" to be aired on Saturday evenings in England and on Saturday mornings on KCET. Multi-episodic serials were the norm, not the exception as it is with modern TV serials. With time however, as they became uncommon somehow the term ""episode"" became to mean ""serial"" and when a modern serial is multi-episodic it is to be called a ""two or more part episode"" which is a corruption of language!

I love this serial because as with so many of the earlier Dr. Who ones there is plenty of personality drama! I cannot see at all why another reviewer found this video story boring! He or she must not care much for personalities but I understand that there has been a shift in consciousness from the 1970s to our present sensation/action oriented viewers.

I find the paleo-science in this picture all wrong! If the so-called Silurians were to exist they would have dated from the latest part of the Cretaceous Era when the continents were very much separated and looked similar to how they do today just before the Second Great Extinction event, moreover, very large-brained reptiles is a contradiction in terms! They would have had to be warm-blooded and dinosaur-like as opposed to reptile-like. Obviously the Doctor does not know the difference! The conception of the ""Silurians"" although impossible is nonetheless interesting and this original presentation of them I see as the best by far: the sequels do not even come close! The portrayal of a different kind of sentient comparable to us in intelligence and technology is well-done. The acting in this serial is also well done and makes the story come very much alive. My copy of this serial on VHS is part of my numerous Doctor Who video and audio collection!

The year 1970 precisely was also a great year for Doctor Who in video and all 3 of the 7 part ones in this year I find notable. The first one starring Jon Pertwee I also like very much but not as much as the following 3 with Caroline John as his companion. Fortunately she returned in many audio stories.",1351209600,,2290,4.67741935483871
7848271,5,630348266X,"The Doctor and his companions at UNIT are called to a search centre to deal with unexplained power loss and nervous breakdowns among the staff.  Before long they have uncovered a race of people who once ruled the Earth but were driven into suspended animation by some predicted global disaster.
This is Dr Who at its best.  The storyline is intelligent and well-thought-out, the characters are strong (Pertwee is a likeable eccentric/gentleman version of the central character), there are some great pieces of dialogue (the 'house of rats' analogy, for example), and despite the length of the story (7 episodes) there is no padding to speak of.  The incidental music sometimes borders on the idiotic, but that minor detail doesn't detract from this fine tale.",1050364800,2,759,5.056
7848272,5,630348266X,"At Wenley Moor, an atomic research center built into a network of caves is experiencing an abnormally high rate of personnel absenteeism and unexplained power losses that force the crew to hastily shut down the reactor.  Then, two junior technicians who are out potholing (Brit. term for spelunking) are attacked, one is killed by some kind of creature with an ominous roar, the other is driven mad and scribbles drawings on his hospital room wall, including some bipedal reptilian creatures.
Director Charles Lawrence has personalized the project to the point that shutting it down would mean the end of his career, and he reluctantly has UNIT to help him get things back to normal ASAP.  However, Dr. John Quinn, Lawrence's number two, seems to be involved in something with his assistant Ms. Dawson.  A potholer himself, he is in contact with certain beings who have promised him a higher form of scientific knowledge.  Could they be the party involved?
The Doctor and Liz discover that the neuroses rate is 200% above the normal and involves humans who worked at one time in the cyclotron room, which is the deepest part of the caves.  The caves are the key to the mystery.
Certain episodes have a theme.  Episode 3 has a military theme, with a military search operation filled with choppers, dogs, soldiers, flares being fired.  It ends with the object of that search, a Silurian, making its first detailed appearance.  Episode 6 is the frenzied crisis episode, with people succumbing to a Silurian virus, collapsing with facial discolourations, ambulances and police appearing in the streets, and the Doctor and Liz working to make an antidote from various medicines.
Big goof:  in Episode 7, Liz says ""Van Allen Belt"" when she should have said ""ozone layer.""  And she's a doctor of science to boot!  Shame on you, Liz!
Of the guest stars, Fulton MacKay plays the charmingly smooth Dr. Quinn, effectively showing him as someone who is driven by wanting to attain superior scientific knowledge to the point of personal greed.  However, his palaeontology and geology leaves much to be desired.  He makes references to the Silurian era, yet the Allosaurus is clearly from the Jurassic Period.  The Doctor later goofs things up when encountering their cousins the Sea Devils in the story of the same name, naming the Eocene epoch as their time of origin, at which time Allosaurus were extinct.
Peter Miles plays Dr. Lawrence as a career-driven adminstrator.  He is best known as Nyder in the Who story Genesis Of The Daleks.  Norman Jones (Major Baker) later played Hieronymous in The Masque Of Mandragora.  And a young Geoffrey Palmer (As Time Goes By series) plays Permanent Undersecretary Masters.
The second televised Jon Pertwee story demonstrates that 7-episode stories work if they are effectively utilized, and The Silurians is a prime example of that.  There's suspense, a good story, the conflict between peace and diplomacy versus military power, factionalism within a civilization (peaceful versus racist as seen in the Old Silurian and New Silurian), and the dangers of nuclear power, especially at a time when it was seen as a cheap way to make electric power.  A strong story to follow the classic Spearhead From Space.",1038614400,4,3236,4.992551210428306
7848273,5,630348266X,"Also known as Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters, this story is one of the better ones of the Pertwee years. The second story involving the third Doctor takes place in the peak district of Derbyshire where a secret atomic research power station is experiencing dramatic and sudden power losses.
Some unexplained deaths in the underground caverns seem unconnected but soon it becomes clear that a dormant race of reptilian creatures who were part of an advanced society before the onset of the Ice Age have been awakened and are intent on reclaiming what is rightfully theirs, the earth.
The story is set in the still continuing cold war background at a time when there was also an energy crisis. Both of these themes are strongly in evidence in the script. The new Doctor is seen to be an opponent of force as his previous incarnations have also been but in this Doctor, the role of peacemaker is much more prominent. He is determined to seek peace between the Silurians and the warm bloods but is twarted in this by the machinations of the military among UNIT, the security staff at the research station and among the Silurians themselves.
His attempts to secure peace fail and he is deceived into believing that the Silurians will merely be sealed off in their caves only to find that the caves themselves are destroyed.
These early depictions of the Pertwee Doctor point to a more principled, outspoken Doctor than in the past who is not prepared to put up with the jingoistic claptrap that comes from the Brigadies. This eventually changes which is why I admit to preferring the early Pertwee espisodes to the later.",1034121600,4,1618,4.74113475177305

7848275,5,630348266X,Dr Who and the Silurians is undoubtly the best Jon Pertwee story. It sees the debuet of surley the best Dr Who monsters ever(Silurians)who reapear in Warriors of the deep. The story is gripping. The actors are the best and  costumes and acting is superb. I would strongly recomend any one to buy  this classic Dr Who andventure!,957398400,2,328,4.637931034482759
7848276,2,630348266X,"I went into The Silurians, hoping for a good story.  I came out with a bad taste in my mouth.
The Silurians is terribly slow, so slow in fact, that I actually fell asleep while watching.  The monsters are poorly realised,  the characters sad and one-dimensional.  I even disliked the Brigadier in  this one!
So go for my advice.  Get Inferno!",956448000,,342,4.524590163934426
7848277,5,630348266X,"One of Pertweee's best, if not the best in his reign. Malcolm Hulke's script is full of intelligent points, moral dilemmas, and sophisticated excitement. Pertwee's Doctor may never have been better than in this story,  which features his alienness and his feelings about his exile in full,  glorious writing. The Silurians themselves get a few emotional moments, and  this story stretched the idea of how a Doctor Who monster could be  portrayed. Any true Doctor Who fan recognizes this as one of the best in  the series' history. At seven episodes, it never drags, but instead seems  more epic in scope. Absolutely necessary to any collection.",945820800,3,644,5.028301886792453
7848278,3,630348266X,"I suppose that Dr. Who and the Silurians is a nice episode, but REALLY, I know they didn't have much to work with, but the silurians are one of the worst designed monsters in Doctor Who! Don't buy it if you don't want to  laugh at the main villian every time it appears.",940291200,2,270,4.09433962264151
