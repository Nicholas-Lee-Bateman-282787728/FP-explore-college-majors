8453437,5,B0051ZPTIW,"This is an account of one of the greatest engineering achievements of all time, extinguishing the 640 burning oil wells in Kuwait. The project was daunting, with even Red Adair projecting it would take at least five years. It was done in less than nine months. You can see my contribution to the effort, the venturi tube, in action. Watch as Army engineers use a howitzer to blow out one well. This is a documentary tribute to human imagination and indomitability.",1383264000,,464,4.7407407407407405
