2529716,5,B000EQHXFK,"This is good stuff.  I was surprised that I could pick up the moves so quickly.  Some take some practice and when attempting them the first time, sometimes you will invent your own twist, so give it a try and see what happens.  Lots of good basics but also room to grow (and other stuff that's just amazing to watch and aspire to!)  If you have a portable/non-installed pole, you will want to be careful in which moves you attempt for safety's sake.  Otherwise, lots of fun to watch and try to do Fawnia's moves at home.",1179100800,7,520,4.319587628865979
2529717,3,B000EQHXFK,"I've owned this DVD for a couple years now (this one, and the second one of the series) because they've been available through Fawnia Mondey's website for a very long time, although they look like they've been repackaged for Amazon.  From what another reviewer said, I can assume that the DVD itself is the same: set in a clothing shop, not many tricks, etc.  The intruction for pole tricks isn't bad, it's just a little too easy for me.  There really weren't many pole tricks at all- a lot of info on covering ground/travelling across a stage, and other stuff. I do like her sequence on stretching for extreme flexibility, as it only helps make you a better, stronger poledancer.  The additional advice about what to wear & when to actually strip I personally don't like, but that's probably because I got into this for fitness, not for stripping.  It felt a little cheesy to me.  I'm currently checking out other DVD options for poledance tricks.",1174176000,32,948,4.680722891566265
2529718,5,B000EQHXFK,"This is been by far the best DVD I have seen on Pole Dancing.  Very Easy, slow paced, slow music.  Hey, I'm a beginner, I want it easy!  This was great to learn by.  If you are super advanced it's not for you.",1163030400,14,209,3.7906976744186047
2529719,1,B000EQHXFK,"This DVD is a big waste of time and money.  I've been learning tricks for about 3 months with a few different DVD's and I'd have to say this is the worst one I've seen yet. Since the teacher is a stripper that won all these awards I thought it would have been better then what it was.  It's filmed in some dance clothing store for goodness sakes!

If you're interested in learning pole tricks you should really start with Sheila Kelly's S Factor pole work video (step by step with a good 20 minute warm up session) or Pole Kats Intermediate video (both teachers were strippers and do a pretty good job of instruction).  Those are both way better.  I do NOT recommend this DVD to anyone. I'm glad I only paid $13.00 for it.",1151625600,12,722,4.279411764705882
2529720,5,B000EQHXFK,"I don't understand how this person claims the did research and bough this off of amazon and They love it so much, when it says the item isn't released until may 30th? Makes me a little weary of ordering.",1147737600,9,203,4.230769230769231

2529724,2,B000EQHXFK,"It taught me a couple of moves, but not how to put them together to create a actual dance. Not impressed with this. Its not step by step she just does the move and your suppoesed to just get the hang of it I guess.",1377820800,,214,3.7777777777777777
2529725,5,B000EQHXFK,"This video gives you a wide variety of tricks to try and shows each move several times with different options.  These options also include what to do after the move, which is lacking in the 2 other DVD's I own.  The production quality of the DVD is good and it is easy to scan through.  I would strongly recommend it.",1373068800,,317,4.25
2529726,2,B000EQHXFK,I bought this video and viewed it.... but I never desired to use the techniques or even workout to it in over 2 years.,1369094400,,118,3.9583333333333335
2529727,1,B000EQHXFK,"This DVD was not what I expected, she was a good teacher but the advanced moves are pretty basic and it don't teach many swings. Waste of money",1295481600,,143,4.142857142857143
2529728,3,B000EQHXFK,This movie was filmed very ghetto.  I think an amature could have done a better job. The pole tricks were good but the video was not impressive at all.  It looks like it was filmed at a random  store.  I am a bit disappointed with this film.  I probably won't purchase another one of these videos.,1293321600,,297,4.232142857142857
2529729,5,B000EQHXFK,"This DVD is 100% what I was looking for.  There's no music and it is a super cheesy setting, but that's not what I was looking for in a how to pole dance DVD.  There's a really brief warm-up section.  And then it's right to the moves. They're separated by difficulty level.  She does the move first, then she breaks it down and shows you step by step.  Then she does the move again a few times.  Along the way, she completes and then breaks down some transitional moves.  A lot of the moves are variations from an earlier move. That way, it's easy to start to get the hang of coming up with your own slight variations.

This DVD is really great at breaking down each move and transition move.  There's no choreographed routine in here, just the individual moves.  I think putting it all together is the easy part, though, once you know what you're doing.  That wasn't what I was looking for in this DVD.  Still, she probably could have added a quick routine at the end as a summary.

I really found this to be a great workout and lots of fun!",1280448000,3,1042,4.255102040816326
2529730,2,B000EQHXFK,"The video showed several moves, and over half of them were not for beginners.
It was extremely low budget, and did not have any music to accompany it.

I was really hoping to learn tricks and moves, but also how to do transitions and put them into a routine. This DVD does NOT in any way do that. It shows clips that move on from one to another, never putting them into a routine.

I would not recommend this, and I am currently shopping for a different DVD",1272153600,,457,4.181818181818182

2529733,3,B000EQHXFK,"This DVD has some very cool moves for beginners, however, there is no step by step approach.  Fawnia Mondey does the move a few times and you move on.  You have to work out a lot of it on your own, because her directions would help someone more advanced but, not a baby dancer.  On the other hand, the dvd has some cool moves, and it's worth watching, because she is very good.  To do do any of the stuff on it, you will have to watch it several times.",1247443200,3,452,3.988888888888889
2529734,2,B000EQHXFK,"I'm a beginner at pole dancing. I wanted to have a detailed video with basic moves, transitions, etc, but I also wanted to see routines. After all, it is pole dancing, not aerobics. The video was a little too clinical and didn't have as many types as moves as I wanted. It's OK as part of the library, but you need to suppelment with others.",1244332800,,341,4.2615384615384615
2529735,2,B000EQHXFK,This is an alright video. I am a beginner at this with some dance experience. This is not a very detailed video they show a couple of move and that was it. I had hoped for a lot more of the lesson part.,1241308800,,202,3.7209302325581395
2529736,4,B000EQHXFK,"This video is old & is done on a very low budget but the moves are still good ones and the instruction is very good.  Fawnia explains it all very clearly.  I can't do most of them yet but one day I will conquer it all (maybe!).  If you're brand new and looking for some tricks, this is a good video.  If you plan to become a pole fitness instructor through Fawnia's classes, this video is required.",1235433600,,398,4.12987012987013
2529737,1,B000EQHXFK,"The cover of the DVD is deceiving as it makes it look like this is actually a professional production! In the beginning, the instructor openly admits that she couldn't get the rights to any song, so there's no music in the video. Also, it's horribly videotaped, and she also has her friend do the ""painful"" or hard moves. You can find better quality on Youtube... I ordered ""Art of Pole"" by Jemilla (not sold on Amazon), and I""m hoping that one will be more effective. Don't waste your money on this.",1234051200,4,500,4.5054945054945055
2529738,5,B000EQHXFK,"Having wasted money on what I call 'pole-dancing theory' and 'mental-preperation-to-be-sexy' where they crawl around on the floor for 45 minutes then later remember there IS a pole -- for all the horrible production (non-existant, more correctly) this dvd DOES MOVES! Fawnia is sweet, unpretentious, balanced, thoughful and intelligent.

Sure, it's shot in a clothing shop in like 1995, and all I can think when I watch it is that someone from Motley Crew is about to swing by with said hair-band in-tow and whisk her away in the middle of the lesson, but God bless her, she SHOWS how to do moves on the pole! Which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for Shelia Kelly's horrible waste of money dvds which is all 'emotional-prepardness-to-bring-out-your-inner-sex-kitten' sham/scam for 2 dvds before they feel they can emotionally 'bond' with a pole. Gag.

This dvd assumes you're already a sexy female and doesn't hold your hand and explain it to you first. It's ALL about the athletism of the pole. If you're a 'lets get to the point yesterday' kind of learner, this dvd will keep you busy for a while. It's not for beginners in my opinion, but it is good for intermediate vertical dancers that are confident on the pole already.

Fawnia thank goodness you're an instructor not a rambler! The world of dvd instructional dance needs more people like you!",1227830400,5,1358,4.770212765957447
2529739,5,B000EQHXFK,"I have all of Fawnia's DVDs and I also received my Instructor Certification through her in Las Vegas.  Not only is she probably THE most knowledgable pole dance instructor in the USA, she is down to earth and genuinely helpful to ALL her students.
This is a fabulous beginner's DVD and she makes sure to point out proper movement so newbie's don't hurt themselves.
Once you're done with the DVD, pack you bags and go to Vegas to her Pole Fitness Studio for live lessons!

8113342,3,B000EQHXFK,"I purchased this video because I heard pole fitness is fun and excellent way to get back in shape after having a baby.
I purchased an x pole sport, Mighty grip, and this video.  I took a few pole fitness classes at my local gym but due to baby sitting cost I plan to do more of my workouts at home.  This video teaches you the name of the moves and show you how to perform them and how to transition moves. She goes at a slow pace and it's non intimidating.

What it does not provide is step-by-step basic instructions on how to position your body or grip the pole.  Crucial information that I think an absolute beginner needs to know in order to prevent injury.  There is no music.  As I watch the video it appears to be created during the 90's.  I personally think music and an up to date video would be more fun especially since pole dance/pole fitness no longer has taboos associated with it and there are a lot more moves to learn that this video don't mention (probably because it was created during the 90's or something).

Overall, for the price (under $15.00)  and for anyone who want to learn the basic moves and the names of the moves this video is a good purchase.
If you are a absolute basic beginner I would suggest you first start with a video that provides a more thorough warm up to pole dancing/ pole fitness and a step-by step introduction video teaching you how to properly grip the pole, stand etc. .  Then graduate to ""The Are of Exotic Dancing"" video to learn how to enhance your knowledge and transition your moves into a routine or something.",1480032000,,1567,4.335616438356165
