8603724,4,B000ENUW9W,First off the video quality is fair to poor. Sound from one set to another is different for some reason. No 5.1 or dolby seems like a shame considering the quality of the stars. The editing is not great they seem to want to use crazy effects and jump cuts for no reason. An upside down view of the drummer? Oversaturate Michael Rose during his set. Blue framing around one artist for most of the set. Grey boxing of another artist. An annoying subtitle in the corner advertising the company who put it out. I would keep that a secret if I were you guys. Poor over all product with one saving grace. The artist in this DVD shine through the goo to make this worth having. These artist are hard to find in video form and this is a rare glimpse of them at a pretty good concert. Too bad production quality is not up to snuff. I would suggest this concert if you are a fan of any of these artist. I just wish they had taken more care in the recording and production. It is region 2 so it will not work in most US DVD players.,1178150400,,1021,4.11
