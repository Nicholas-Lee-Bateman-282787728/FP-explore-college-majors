It's a philosophical movie with characters reminiscent of those you're likely to find in life: the lonely middle-aged man, who wants to make a positive impact in the world; a wasteful liberal idealist; a happy-go-lucky optimistic fool; a hard-edged pessimistic borderline criminal; a gossipy minimalist worker, and more.

 I haven't yet seen a bad movie by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. I've seen only two. The other was Once Upon a Time in Anatolia. They are both good movies, but I must qualify 'good': I couldn't watch either in one sitting. They are long-drawn-out, but meaningful, and most importantly made me come back and find out what happens in the end.",1426636800,5,819,5.014705882352941

7027383,5,B00U1T4B1E,"Nuri Bilge Ceylan's ""Winter Sleep"" is a magnificent adaptation of a Chekhov story.

Ceylan moved the location of the story from Russia to Cappadocia. This gives the opportunity for an incredible setting (BTW if you don't know of Cappadocia, search for images - it is unique). Ceylan, as anyone familiar with his work should expect, does not use this magnificent setting to offer touristy and glamorous views of the landscape. The area is amazing but it is also very sad. The villagers are living in difficult conditions while the main protagonists, the local ""aristocracy"", enjoy very chic living conditions. The contrast between the harsh realities of everyday life and the harsh inner lives of the aristocracy hover over the narration as an imbalance that creates tension; tension that is not really relieved. It stays there and it continues perennially, with no release, no solution in sight.

As expected in a Chekhov story you get a lot of one to one conversations that start from a seemingly insignificant issue and develop into existential soul-searching that never ends; exhilarating and exhausting. And, in a different way than his previous films, there is nothing supernatural or uncanny to change the pace. And as with most Chekhov, it deals with the aristocracy because they don't have and material problems; they do not agonize over where the next meal is coming; they only have to agonize over their personal issues and their relationships.

The film is awe-inspiring. The acting is superb. The pace slow with long shots but enthralling in the way it goes deeper and deeper into the characters. If you want action and fast pace this is not for you; if you want tales that come to a definite happy or not happy end again this is not for you. If you savor the way people deal with each other and themselves, warts and all, when nothing else distracts them from that task then this film is for you!

Amazing!",1426032000,46,1919,4.859327217125382
7027384,3,B00U1T4B1E,"Warning: This review contains some spoilers

This is the first film I have seen by Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film festival favorite who won the main award of the 2014 Cannes film festival with this. I wasn't thoroughly convinced by it (it's too long, almost three hours and fifteen minutes and the characters engage too many times in aimless philosophical discussions), though it has its moments. It is a mostly ""true to life"" film, though being true to life doesn't always makes a movie interesting.

The main character is Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) a retired actor who lives in picturesque Cappadocia managing a boutique hotel he has inherited from his father that is seemingly carved in rock. He has also inherited properties in the surrounding area. Aydin sees himself as a sort of the area's enlightened feudal lord, though some of the villagers would beg to argue with the enlightened part, as he is often in violent conflict with those who are late with the rent. Among them is the tough ex-convict Ismail (Nejat Isler), who lives in a dilapidated house with his wife, their son Ilyas (who at the beginning of the movie throws a rock to the car in which Aydin was driving) and his brother Hamdi (Serhat Kilic), the ingratiating, obsequious local imam. Ismail would return towards the end of the film with one of its best scenes, when he pointedly rejects and destroys a valuable present brought by Aydin's wife.

In the hotel, Aydin lives mostly with his nagging, recently divorced sister, Necla (Demet Akbag), his tough, capable assistant Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) and his younger, beautiful wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen). Aydin and Nihal doesn't seem to be getting along very well, and Nihal tries to enliven her boring life by engaging in charitable work with the area's broken schools, an activity that Aydin mocks. Necla and Nihal criticize Aydin as arrogant and presumptuous. He spend most of the time in the hotel writing a column for the local newspaper (a paper no one reads, according to his sister) and preparing a volume on the history of the Turkish theater (Ceylan might be a bit as presumptuous as Aydin: in the end titles, he quotes Chekhov as a main influence on him).

Not much else happens in the movie in terms of plot, as it is mostly about the relationship between the various characters. The characters are recognizably real, though none of them is very likable. Interestingly, there is a clear distinction between the secular outlook of Aydin and his immediate family and the conservative values of the impoverished, religious villagers, all of whose women use the Islamic scarf.

I wouldn't recommend this film to a casual film-goer, but those who appreciate difficult, arty films, will probably enjoy this. The acting in it is phenomenal.",1425600000,2,2773,4.904051172707889

7027392,4,B00U1T4B1E,"If taken symbolically, the title suggests old age and death. This film isn't really about those things. At 3 hours, 16 minutes, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I can't say I'm disappointed. With virtually no plot, ""Winter Sleep "" (kis uykusu) is an endless series of dialogue driven set pieces among a small group of characters with differing sensibilities. None of these scenes are boring, and the thought-provoking script maintains interest without over-kill. Subjects like self-deception, futility of poverty, hypocrisy, good intentions, pride, and one's relevance in the general scheme of life are addressed, some at great length.

There's no musical score, except a little at the end. The setting in Cappadocia is beautifully photographed, though most everything happens indoors. I was curious to see the film that won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and I'm not disappointed. My only problem with the Blu I watched is that there are no chapter selections, and, with an episodic film this long, that could be an issue for some. Luckily, the subtitles are very easy to read.",1441584000,,1074,5.067796610169491

I can't say enough about the way this film was shot.

7027400,4,B00U1T4B1E,"It takes script, acting and directorial skill to keep a film flowing while still captivating for over three (3) hours. Some credit goes to Chekov for the framework of isolating peoples of different educational; economic; status; etc. backgrounds in one isolated arena and let them duke it out - verbally. The other credit goes to the carved cave dwellings, some of which date back about a thousand years while others are more recent, of the more recent some are quite elaborately constructed, one of which is the film's setting - a modern caved hotel.
Incidentally, the source material for the hills/cliffs is volcanic ash - Tuff (looks like sandstone), a serene natural beauty contrast to the human personalities.
Film should have been titled ""Winter Storm"" as a cabin fever style escalation of verbosity, mostly on issues that range from individual/personal values of the film's characters to more abstractly, human values in general, begin to provoke animosities and distrust.
The central foil is the hotel owner, Aydin, and because of his appropriately stone like demeanor the diatribes just bounce off of him; even seeming to reflect more of the accusers themselves.
I'm inclined to think that a bit more editing would have produced the same film in a little shorter length, but then too we live in a time driven, multitasking environment in contrast to the film's appropriate - time moves glacially slow setting. So the film's molasses slow tedium may have had a purpose.",1433116800,,1477,5.057377049180328

7027403,2,B00U1T4B1E,"I have no problem with talky films, and ""Winter Sleep"" is certainly one of them.  But prospective viewers should beware: if you're not a fan of Anton Chekhov, the Tsarist era Russian playwright, let this film, which was lauded on the festival circuit, pass.  In fact, ""Winter Sleep,"" although set in eastern Turkey, is based on certain works of Chekhov.  There is a plot, it's true, but for all the talk we leave the principal characters, an older husband and a much younger wife, in essentially the same situation we found them at the outset.  While class and religious divisions are delineated, as in Chekhov, those seeking character development should look elsewhere.",1432080000,6,670,4.955357142857143
7027404,5,B00U1T4B1E,"3  hours of dialogue probably sounds unbearable to most anyone these days, but Winter Sleeps writing is so damn riveting that the experience actually ends up feeling too short by its end. Each conversation is an epic in itself, some lasting nearly 30 minutes, all of which are complete with their very own arc, and packed with unrelenting tension. I had almost forgotten how suspenseful dialogue on its own can be.

Action in movies is a little overrated these days, and often just plain stupid, an insult by big-budget industries who have zero confidence in your ability to think anymore.  Ill take the risk of sounding like a pretentious jerk by saying that, as viewers, weve forgotten that a movie doesnt need to be preposterous (e.g., giant robots destroying Manhattan, 5+ superheros in one movie, etc) to be enthralling.  Hold on, because superheros and giant robots definitely have a place in cinema, and those sorts of moviescan be loads of fun.  I guess my point is that what really counts at the end of the day, no matter whats happening onscreen, is whether a movie can keep its audience in suspense, grip us with a genuine feeling of urgency, and imbue a sense of absolute necessity to all of its events.  Spectacle is great, but were beginning to forget how engaging drama can be. Winter Sleep is astounding because,despite its inaction, it is rife with tension in every scene.

The origin of film belongs just as much to language as it does image, so it shouldnt be surprising that a character-driven drama can be very suspenseful.  Lets take a modern example, a mainstream, yet also mostly favorably critiqued director: Quentin Tarantino.  Words have enormous weight in his films, and they grip just as tightly as his use of imagery or action.  Despite the fact that characters might justbe sitting in chairs or standing in hallways, while merely talking, the suspense is electric, and it never lets go. The tension, the awkwardness, the painall the emotions exchanged between charactersthey hit with a frightening realness, a palpability primarily known to life yet perfectly communicable through film, just as long as a screenwriter is willing to put in the hard work beforehand.

Similarly, Winter Sleep has a kind of rhythm and elastic snap to its dialogue that is retained throughout the entire film.  The script is really damn wonderful, and yet,as much as the movie may consist of talking, it never quite seems like a filmed play: its just as cinematic as it is talky. Each character feels singularly powerful in their own way, god-like before the camera, if anything just because of how incredibly REAL they feel.  These actors are convincing: every sigh,tear, or bout of a laughter mandates your empathy, your love.

What we have here is a beautifully photographed, sharply written film about marriage, morality, wealth and poverty, and the mysteries of aging into an uncertain future.  The plot concerns a retired theatre actor, Aydin, who runs a small hotel with his beautiful younger wife.  It doesn't take long to see how flawed these characters are, and this is where the entertainment ultimately resides.  I don't want to say much more about the story, but within 15 minutes Winter Sleep will have you.

Yes, these kind of movies take patience, and some dialogue-driven films can be just plain boring; but Winter Sleep blew me away, and it supplied such genuine suspense, the kind that has been missing from the drama genre these days.",1431993600,12,3464,4.912521440823328
7027405,4,B00U1T4B1E,"I am two hours into this film and will finish the last hour in the near future.  Too long for me at one sitting.

7027406,5,B00U1T4B1E,"Excellent film if you are the mood for film analysis or reflections on society. Very powerful film, moving, and taps many social and personal themes particularly around socio-economic differences, that are universal beyond Turkey.

However, you must be in the mood for 3 hours of reflection. Perhaps break it up into 2 1.5 hour viewing periods!",1431043200,4,344,5.142857142857143
7027407,4,B00U1T4B1E,"Winter Sleep is a very long film (196 minutes), which would ordinarily send me running. But I have to admit, this film has an almost hypnotic draw. I just wish the director had lopped off a half hour to 45 minutes during editing.

Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) owns and operates the Hotel Othello in Turkey. The name derives from Aydims affection for Shakespeare. He acted on the stage for 25 years and is proud that he never was reduced to doing TV soap operas. He enjoys being the center of attention in the warm, isolated hotel with all the modern conveniences.

Because of Aydims isolation from the greater world, he fails to recognize that he turns people off. His theatricality and tendency to suck the air around him with his pontifications and anecdotes are often stifling . Rarely these days does a film concentrate so completely on one character. More commonly, characterization is second to plot, particularly in American films. Its unusual to explore this man from so many different facets.

The movies universal theme is how perceptions of ones self and those of others can differ so markedly. The winner of the Palme dor at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Winter Sleep is a fascinating look at people whose everyday lives  on the surface mundane  take on significance because of their history, culture, and resentments. The cinematography and majestic outdoor scenes provide an often breathtaking setting.

The film is in Turkish, with English subtitles. There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray edition.",1430784000,11,1512,4.956521739130435

7027412,4,B00U1T4B1E,"Nuri Bilge Caylan is not known for his brevity as a film maker `Once Upon a time in Anatolia' being a good case in point from 2011. Here we have another film where not a lot appears to happen. However that is the point. Set in the beautifully picturesque location of Cappadocia in his native Anatolia we meet Aydin who is an ex stage actor cum hotelier and land lord to locals.

He lives with his much younger wife Nihal and his sister Necla who is still suffering the breakdown of her marriage. Meanwhile the winter is rapidly approaching and as the days grow shorter and the guests dwindle the three have more time to spend with each other. This also allows more time to let smouldering resentments burst into flames bordering on contempt. We also get the background issues of social inequality, the lazy rich, the injustice of public humiliation and the servile attitudes of those who rely on others for a living.

This is slower than a slow burner and at three hours can be seen by some to more than outstay its welcome. However, I was absolutely transfixed from about ten minutes in. Aydin loves an argument and can come across as being completely reasonable whilst at the same time displaying levels of hypocrisy so high that they would make most dizzy to behold. This though is all done in - mostly- subtle undertones. The real beauty of this film is that it is nor afraid to take its time to explore to the enth degree a subject with a short shelf life that somehow manages to take on a new aura purely by the weight of examination at microscopic levels.

Simple acts take on ritualistic meanings and the unspoken is often more important than the spoken word as he reveals the necessary smoke screens we use vocabulary to engender whilst hiding our true selves in open sight. As I said over three hours long, beautifully shot and with acting that is a joy to watch and good sub titles.
