You can't watch it.

It came in perfect new packaging without a mark on it which is deceiving.

My expectations were not met at all far from it.",1369267200,,221,4.238095238095238
8158648,3,6301180712,"The film opens with an odd scene. Carlos Quintas (Andy Garcia), a Latin-American president living in exile, takes the night underground while dreams of his beloved, Kate (Kitty Aldridge). It's a good beggining for a promising story. The plot is clever, focusing on the strange relations between the superpowers (Great Britain, for instance), and the dictatorship of Carlos Quintas' country (any resemblance with all latin-american dictatorships in the 70's and 80's is not purely coincidental). There's good action and some pleasant moments, such as the poetry of the president (The verses belong, in fact, to chilean poet Pablo Neruda). The solution, however, is easy, even romantic, turning the film into any other ""Casablanca"" style. That's the reason this movie won't take 5. It deserves 3 stars, excellent for a cheap production.",975196800,,834,5.374045801526718
