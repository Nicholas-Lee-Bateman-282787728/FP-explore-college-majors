384888,5,6301930789,"This tale is not from Chaucer, but from Atwood. Natasha Richardson is Kate, a young fertile woman enslaved by a dystopian society where fertility is worth more than the life it produces. As creepy and disturbing as it is, particularly ""The Ceremony"" scene, it is still hopeful. Aidan Quinn, Robert Duvall, Elizabeth McGovern and Faye Dunaway all turn in magnificent performances.

This is Natasha Richardson's tour de force. She is radiant and heroic. Kate becomes Offred, but never loses herself.",1518307200,4,497,5.2125

384891,4,6301930789,"It is totally unfair to compare a 2 hour movie made in 1990 to a series made in 2017! And I'm trying not to!! (But it's really difficult!) Ok, the movie deviated from the book in some really key areas. First of all, you did not get the since of confinement, restriction, uncertainty, and never ending terror that Offred conveyed in the book. In the movie, she was much more resigned to her fate and her surroundings, and she had an almost cavalier attitude. Next, her involvement with Nick was really portrayed as casual and tawdry, rather than the the multi-layered, emotional connection from the book. In this movie, the commander treated her with more respect than Nick, and she actually seemed to like him more! So overall, the movie was okay, but not great. It fell flat emotionally, and sparked no feelings of terror of dread whatsoever, which is the exact opposite of the book.

On a side note, Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway look much more like the characters described in the book! In comparison to the series (sorry!) they look much more the part than Yvonne Stravinsky and Joseph Fiennes, but are no comparison in terms of ability to portray them! In the beginning of the movie, you are anticipating the ceremony with Dunaway and Duvall to make you just cringe, but it really doesnt. On the other hand...Joseph Fiennes....um, how to put this? He looks GREAT!  How bad can it be? Well, BAD!! REALLY BAD!! Creep you totally out bad!! Stravinsky and Fiennes are just superb! So that's it. I'd read the book first, watch the movie second, then watch the series and pray like the rest of us for April to hurry up!!!",1516233600,10,1621,4.625

385105,5,6301930789,"I will only consider here the 1990 film with Faye Dunaway, not the novel beyond, nor of course the recent adaptation as a TV series that is not available on the DVD market.

We are in the United States of America after it became the Republic of Gilead. I will not enter the Biblical meaning of this word that can be used to designate some regions of the old Biblical Israel and three characters in the Old Testament, among them the father of Jephthah, that crazy general who swore to have the first person coming to him after the battle if it is a victory sacrificed to God. He thus has to put his daughter to death.

But that gives you the flavor of the story. In this Republic of Gilead, men are absolutely dominant and they have reinstalled or reinstated the standard total submission of women to go against the total dissolution of society before due to sexual promiscuity, abortion, family planning, contraception, artificial insemination, gender orientation, etc. Women have to go back to their main and only function in that male-dominated society: to give birth to babies conceived in the normal natural good old intercourse between a man and a woman. And thats where the story becomes bizarre or even squalid.

Women are, like for men in Brave New World, divided into clearly defined groups that have to dress in a particular color. Grey is for the plain servants. Then, red is for the handmaids, those whose sole function is to procreate babies with the master of the household they are attached to. White is for some kind of religious characters who participate in various rites. Maroon is for the women who are controlling the handmaids, assigning them wherever they are needed, and of course punishing them when necessary. Blue is for the ladies of the various households whose babies are produced by the handmaids attached to them and their husbands. All men are in black. There is a last category of women: those who cannot be integrated into any category, particularly as handmaids and are the girls of some parties for the masculine elite. In other words, they are the escorts or working girls of the elite men of the society.

The disease that is the cause of this situation is purely surreal, causing the sterility of most women and those who are not sterile are used as reproductive human chattel. The film though seems to hint that the man, Fred, Kate, the handmaid the story is centered on, should provide with a child, is sterile, and his sterile wife, Serena, suggests Kate should use the services of her husbands chauffeur, Nick. All that is of course sordid. During that time Fred, the Commander, is systematically hunting down the resistance with the clear objective of exterminating them. Today we call that genocide. Apart from Blacks and gays, the concept of resisting people is rather vague and we can wonder how this elite can live if there is no proletariat, even lumpen-proletariat to work for them.

Fred falls in love with Kate, but that brings no pregnancy. Nick, on the other hand, falls in love with her too and she with him and that brings a pregnancy as if without equally shared love there is no pregnancy possible. When Serena learned that Fred had taken Kate to one of the elites parties and that she had worn her own black clothing instead of her red dress, she becomes furious and wants a vengeance. On the other hand, Nick and Kate want to escape Gilead with their future baby.

Thats the dramatic knot in the thread of that story, a Gordian knot actually and it will have to be cut, but how and for what future?

The fact that this old novel and this here old film have been remembered for a TV series has, of course, to do with the election of the present President of the USA. The rise of bigotry and populism in the USA today is seen as dangerous. Just the same way The Man in the High Castle, an old novel stating the same type of dystopia centered on men essentially has been brought back to life by Amazon Prime, this Handmaids Tale, centered as it is on women, had to be brought back to life too. The present period in our globalized world is bringing up the question of refusing change and even dreaming of a full U-turn and going back to what the world was in the past, the Old Testament in this case, A victory of Japan and Germany in 1945 in The Man in the High Castle. The pessimist are going to say that will lead to the Third World War. The optimist will say that God or mans rational wisdom will prevail and the Singularity of Intelligent Machines will bring humanity eternal life and absolute peace with no work what so ever to do. The dream of a permanent siesta or farniente. Though it may very well be a Matrix that leads to eternal slavery and war.

385383,4,6301930789,"I watched this movie a long time ago.  As pure entertainment, it was good...the leads all did a pretty good job acting and the fictional world in which they lived in was interesting.  The story in the movie as I understand it is somewhat different in outcomes from the book.  I think probably the best and certainly the most eerie scenes were the ones where the exploitation and violation of the handmaids was dressed up as a sacrament of sorts.

What I don't get is people arguing that somehow ""the Handmaid's Tale"" is something that could happen in real life just around the corner.  Anyone who really believes that a right-wing Christian dictatorship is about to emerge in the United States strikes me as deluded to put it mildly.  Granted, there are a small number of people in the US who probably would love imposing that sort of regime on the rest of us.  But there are also a small number of people in the US who would love to impose a North Korea style dictatorship on the rest of us.  In either case, the possibility of that happening is so remote, it's laughable.

It seems to me that rather than look at the continuing battles over abortion and other women's rights issues as an indicator that a Christian dictatorship is lurking around the corner, one should instead take it as proof that not everyone in the US agrees what constitutes proper policy about these weighty issues.  And bear in mind, there are a lot of women out there who are pro-life...it's not all patriarchs.

To me, ""the Handmaid's Tale"" is worthwhile as entertainment.  But frankly, acting like it's about to be imposed for real in today's America is every bit as hateful and paranoid as believing in the warped world of a book called ""The Turner Diaries.""  That book was written by a white supremacist and his dark vision is that Jews, blacks, and other ""undesirables"" impose a left wing dictatorship on gun-loving white people who rise up and commit acts of terrorism against their ""subhuman"" rulers.  That book incidentally was the favorite of Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh.  To me going around thinking that either nightmare is about to come true is nutty and grossly unfair and bigoted to the supposed ""evildoers"" in those two books.

So see the movie and/or watch the mini-series and enjoy it as entertainment.  And if you really are concerned about gender apartheid in the world today, do something for women living in places like Taliban controlled Afghanistan.  That's a place that's a lot closer to the ugly world of the Handmaid's Tale than anything likely to happen in the United States of America.",1492992000,4,2598,4.722838137472284

385474,3,6301930789,"I may be at a disadvantage here because I haven't read the book, which reportedly has reached new heights of popularity since the last presidential election.  Whether the film is a warning or a how-to guide depends on the viewer's sensibilities and whether they are horrified or delighted by the reduction of women to breeding factories.  A great deal must have been left out; there is a revolutionary movement whose philosophy and organization is unclear, and for such a supposedly religious society, we get very little information on how worship is conducted.  If Robert Duvall plays one of the leaders, he's surprisingly secular.  I found myself looking for the character he played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Apostle/dp/B00007ELF1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Apostle</a>, a violent and emotional pastor whose life deteriorates when his wife leaves him and his church fires him.  It's clear from the Bible-ish names like ""Gilead"" and ""Offred"" that religion is the guiding principle of this society; we just don't get to see any of it.

The film does convey the effect of extreme objectification - the sexual encounters solely for the purpose of making babies, where the man must grip a bedpost to support himself because he is not allowed to touch his partner (who is lying on top of his infertile wife), and the strip club where men may go to briefly escape the unnatural restrictions of their society.  Women are either madonnas or whores.  Robert Duvall's portrayal of a high-level commander manages to communicate both the man's inherent tenderness along with his acceptance of the society as the only possible option in a world where very few people are still fertile.  Other memorable scenes show how the women are affected by regimentation and their categorization into different classes, differentiated by their dress.  It may not be a beautifully shot or composed film, but it is striking in many places.

If you're looking for a film that shows how religion objectifies women, I would recommend the far better&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Osama/dp/B0001IXTDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Osama</a>, an Afghan film about life under the Taliban, in which a young girl is forced to impersonate a boy in order to get a job and support her family, after her father dies and her mother, a doctor, is forbidden from working or even leaving the house.  Several reviewers have commented on how Natasha Richardson doesn't convey the fear that the character in the book felt; that's not the case in ""Osama"" where Marina Golbahari, the actress who plays the girl, exists in a state of low-grade terror most of the time.  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is a fantasy, and probably an insulting one to many people; ""Osama"" in contrast is far more compelling, as it depicts a society that actually existed.  It's unfortunate that few viewers of this film will be aware of it.  Nevertheless, ""The Handmaid's Tale"" has become almost iconic in American cinema, and is worth watching if only to be familiar with this.",1490572800,,3102,5.3539094650205765

No matter how dark the theme, music and the arts whether literary, visual, musical, dance and as yet undreamed of imaginary dreams will always exist so long as we can think. When I first saw this movie, I put it in the category of Clockwork Orange and unlikely to come to be. That was many years ago. The world has changed and the saying about how it stays the same is true too.. Our imaginations can be as dark as they can be bright. My father played that sax. I was so proud that the producers of the movie picked him. He is an unknown national musician who played for one of the Dorsey bands, was the only guy in high school with a car, especially one he bought with his musical job earnings I was told by my mother's family. He is 96 rapidly approaching 97. He doesn't always know who I am. He worked with a group of retirees to put to pen some of the big band era music and got up at 5 am to volunteer with a high school band. He should be listened to if you have the movie. There is a brief period focusing on his playing. These kind of people refute the movie even if he was a man of his era. He was a loving father to his step children even if I never saw him more than a dozen times between when I was six and nearly 40. I believe in second chances, the possibility of redemption and in the potential of Christianity as a seminary graduate following a degree in fine arts. If ever I believed in dystopia is has been to see what has become of America's so called brand of Christianity. In the words of Anne Frank as best I remember them ""I still believe that people are good at heart.""  In the USA and the world at large today, we have many unpleasant and hateful examples of human thought and behavior. And our planet may have a bleak future. Nevertheless I choose to believe in the great truths of the world's religions and the potential of humans for kindness and empathy and rising above evil. As in this movie, my father's playing of the sax gave a pause from the darkness of the theme of the movie, I believe it is possible for mankind to rise to the examples of great men and women who envisioned a better world.",1486339200,,2186,4.167848699763593

385545,4,6301930789,"I read The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood back around the time this movie came out. Its a scary and troubling piece of literature that seems like the scenario could potentially come to pass. The book is a bit eerier than the film but then the film only has two hours to tell the story. I thought this film was a decent (not great) rendering of the book but in order to appreciate the bigger picture, you must read the book and not just see the film. In 2017, The Handmaids Tale will be a Hulu series starring Elisabeth Moss as Offred (the Natasha Richardson role). That might prove to be rather interesting as Margaret Atwood is actually one of the shows producers. But I digress.

I actually liked this film even with its few campy scenes (Elizabeth McGovern stealing Aunt Lydias uniform in order to escape, tying her to a flushing toilet, for one). Elizabeth McGovern was actually excellent in this.

This story takes place in the recent future in the U.S., or at least a part of it that has been taken over by rebels and renamed The Republic of Gilead. It does fit into the dystopian genre in which some environmental horrors have taken place, leaving most of the women sterilized and unable to bear children. The women are divided into groups and hauled away in cattle cars based upon their ability to bear children. The ones who are fertile must procreate for their country. The others are divvied up to perform other functions  mostly Marthas (maids) and Aunts (the military-type instructors who teach and monitor the Handmaids), but the majority of the infertile women go to labor camps (the colonies) never to be seen again. A select few are saved for prostitution purposes (of course). Many of the men are also unable to father children, but its a mans world and because men matter, they all have a function, mainly military.

Natasha Richardsons character was a librarian before the revolution. When she and her husband try to cross the border of Gilead with their young daughter, they are captured. He is killed, she is sent off to become a Handmaid (named Offred) and the child is taken away to who knows where (we find out later).

The rest of the story revolves around Offreds schooling, placement with a high-level commander (Robert Duvall) and his wife, Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway), and her mediocrely portrayed heartbreak over not knowing the fate of her daughter.  Add to the mix Aiden Quinn as the Commanders security chief (token hottie).

I shouldnt give too much more away about the plot. Suffice it to say, Offred gets mixed up in the revolution and escapes.

I think the most frightening aspect about this is the control men exert over women through male dominance and the use of a skewed Christian doctrine rewritten to benefit men. Women are labeled, categorized and organized. They are not permitted to read, they cannot go out, wear cosmetics or even use moisturizing lotion (Offred steals pats of butter from the dinner tray to use on her dry skin until the Commander gifts her real moisturizing cream). Women  even high-ranking women like Serena Joy  wear uniforms so that they are identifiable within the categories. The wives wear royal blue ensembles, the Handmaids wear red jumpers, the Aunts brown suits and pearls, the Marthas wear maids' clothing. The men, other than military, wear whatever they want. In essence, women are nothing more than objects. At a certain level, you could even categorize the wives as objects, though I don't think they are programmed to see themselves that way.

The film does not capture the fear Offred and the other Handmaids actually experienced. The movies Offred seems to be going with the flow, seemingly unconcerned at her impending doom (death) at not being able to get pregnant by her infertile Commander. There are a few scenes where she almost seems to be enjoying herself, playing games with the Commander in his secret den, commenting to Martha about what a beautiful day it seems to be, joking with Aiden Quinn about their liaison to help get her pregnant. You didn't get that sense about Offred in the book because she lived in a constant state of emotional terror in a world where there was nothing to look forward to each day  just an empty, lonely existence as a tool for the Commanders purposes.

I still enjoyed the film and Im glad I purchased it when I did because its virtually impossible to get now. But I am looking forward to the new series that might end up telling the story more accurately to the books account. I will also be rereading the book before the series begins.

I had no problem playing it---I region-hacked my DVD player when I bought it new a couple months before---but the audio in some parts of the motion picture is so faint I could barely tell what the actors were saying.

Things in the motion picture look pretty much how I imagined them to look when I was reading the book, the only differences being that the costumes looked a little less outlandish than the outfits the characters in the book were described wearing. The movie moves right along, but it seems to move a little to fast because the book is written as Offred's narrative, so of course a lot of her thoughts and contemplations are left out of the movie.

In the movie, Offred's original name is Kate; in the book, she is unnamed before she became Offred. The ending of the book reminded me of ""The Lady, Or The Tiger?"" because we are not told of Offred's ultimate fate; even the epilogue, in which Professor Pieixoto speaks about Offred's narrative having been found as an artifact in the future, doesn't tell us. In the movie, however, Offred's fate is decided for us, and I was disappointed to find that the epilogue delivered by Professor Pieixoto was omitted---that's the only part I felt cheated out of. That, and a few voice-overs by Offred throughout the movie, would've been the only things I'd have added to it.

385752,4,6301930789,"Many people have strong feelings about this movie because it is quite different from the original novel. Yes, it is. But that novel could never be made into a movie that anyone would watch. It would consiste of two hours of watching someone sit in a room and think silently with about 2 minutes of actual activity. Really.

So, rather than berate this because it isn't the novel, I'd instead like to review it as a movie. All by itself. So, I will try to NOT reference what I know from the novel as an explanation of what is going on in the movie.

In this tale, we are in a near future where something ""bad"" has happened in the past. We know this because even though there are houses and streets and cars and shops, there are also guards in black, road blocks and women dressed in only three colors: white, red or blue. In this dystopian future the majority of the world is now sterile or has very low reproductive ability and the world has shifted to a patriarchal rule in which women are both despised and worshipped, but always controlled. We get the impression, but never the outright knowledge, that some war in the past has contaminated humanity and that the Republic of Gideon, once a part of the United States, is assuming control and assuring future prosperity by taking a firm hand of things. (Of course, in the book I know more but this is the movie.)

Our main character is Offred, a woman who is fertile and therefore an asset that must be allocated, used and controlled. She is a Red who has been allocated to a Commander (all males in power) and his wife, a Blue by the name of Serena. Her role is to bear a child for them. It is both horrifying and heart-wrenching to see how this is supposed to come about. But if being a Red like Offred is bad, then NOT being a Red is even worse. A secondary character, Moira, pops up now and again and we get to see one of the ways in which those that are fertile but not obedient are disposed of. If I say more I'll start ruining the story for those who haven't seen it yet, so we'll leave it there.

With the caveat in mind that this is NOT the book, but rather a more visual rendering of the basic premise of the book, I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. While we don't get the same level of back story in how Gilead is formed or the full perspective of Offred's life as a free woman before she was captured to be a Red and we get a very neat ending, we do get the emotional punch. We get the gist and we get the morality question.

When I watched this with a friend who had never seen it before she, a very liberal sort of person, said that she had a hard time enjoying it because it was so unbelievable. That it could never happen here. That is the point. If you think very carefully about it, what would it take to make that happen anywhere this now relatively ""free"". It wouldn't take much. In this case, much of the country is contaminated with radiation and toxicity that has rendered so much sterile. Not just people but land and animals. Resources are hard to get to in such a world. How much restriction in such would be needed before someone had the bright idea to ""control"" everything for the ""common good"" of all.

It wouldn't take much. It took just one terrorist attack here to remove our basic freedom in exchange for the illusion of safety...which we don't have. Dystopias are born of good intentions corrupted by human nature. Yes, that's my quote and it is a truth. I think that is the lesson behind this movie. While this one focuses on the very obvious restriction and slavery of Red women, who in there is really free? No one. Even the ones who think they are in control are themselves slaves to the horror they have created. All freedoms can be exchanged for these Red women though in a similar story.

385753,5,6301930789,"One of the must-not-miss movies of all time, A Handmaid's Tale is both frightening and numbing.  I first read Atwood's book in 1988 and went to an indie movie theater in a store-front attic to see it in 1989. I was very impressed that the movie was as true to the book, more so than most transfers.
Since that first viewing, I have watched it at least 10 times in my Gender and Communication course over the years.  Every time I see the Aunts, my skin crawls.  The scenes of Kate in her ""ceremony"" chill to the bone.  But most gruesome is to see the group of Handmaidens kill an accused rapist with their hands.
Parts and segments of past and current (late 1980's) atrocities in wars and revolts are pieced together in a tight action heart-pounding story as a cautionary tale that is timely as yet another election looms.",1346284800,9,821,4.453333333333333

The ideas are drawn from the the possibilities of a future culture/government that turns the Bible on its head for purposes of planned procreation in a world where the elite women are sterile (as is the leading man), and sex is performed by 'handmaidens' for the State...and its married men...whose wives want children...but can not become pregnant. These 'religious' performances of impregnation are done without showing the body parts involved (cautiously discreet), and in the extra-marital copulation some quiet finesase.  It does not flaunt sex, as in multitudes of other R-Rated films...and keeps to the theme of trying to exist in artificial 'families' in a society based on the 'handmaidens' of the Old Testament...in s stark, hard, sur-religious way.

385877,3,6301930789,"If you've never read Margaret Atwood's THE HANDMAID'S TALE, the 1990 film adaptation by Volker Schlndorff might seem an interesting enough movie. Set in a future in which Christian fundamentalists have overthrown the government, the film paints a terrifying picture of an American theocracy. Women, homosexuals, religious minorities, people of color, political dissidents - all suffer under the oppressive thumb of The Republic of Gilead.

Those familiar with the 1985 novel will see that much of the basic story remains the same in Schlndorff's on-screen adaptation. The former United States is in the midst of a Civil War; The Republic of Gilead holds much of the East Coast, while dissenting religious and secular groups wage war to the South and West. Within the Republic's borders, a strict social structure is enforced. Men are ranked according to prestige and merit (Commanders, Eyes, Angels, Guardians, and businessmen and professionals), while women are grouped according to social function, which is primarily determined by their reproductive health and racial makeup (Aunts, Wives and Daughters, Econowives, Handmaids, Marthas, and Unwomen). While no Gileadean citizen is truly free, it is the females who bear the brunt of Gilead's religious tyranny.

It is in this context that we meet Kate (Offred), a Handmaid who has been assigned to Commander Fred (""Of Fred"") and his Wife, Serena Joy. THE HANDMAID'S TALE is Kate's tale, told in her very own voice, through a disjointed series of flashbacks and present-day narrations. Through Kate's eyes, we reflect upon ""the days before""; we learn how the Sons of Jacob were able to destabilize and eventually topple the American government and institute their own patriarchal theocracy; and we get a glimpse of what daily life in the Republic is like.

Overall, the film retains the tone of the Atwood's story. It's all there: Kate's re-education at The Red Center; the Birthing Ceremony, Prayvaganza, and Women's Salvaging and Particicution; trips to the gynecologist; illicit visits to the Commander's office; the night out at Jezebel's; and, of course, the monthly rape Ceremonies. The acting is solid enough: Natasha Richardson (as Kate), Faye Dunaway (Serena Joy), and Elizabeth McGovern (Moira) are the cast's standouts, though Aidan Quinn (Nick) and Robert Duvall (the Commander) leave something to be desired. The visuals really steal the movie; it's incredible to see Atwood's story take form on-screen. (My favorite prop is a livestock trailer used to transport women to and from the Red Center.) Altogether, it makes for a terrifying dystopian sci fi film...that is, if you haven't yet been ""spoiled"" by the novel.

While the movie does follow the basic plot of THE HANDMAID'S TALE, the filmmakers change a number of small, seemingly insignificant details. Upon closer examination, many of these minor points are actually quite important, and their alteration impacts the story in unanticipated ways, both on an individual and collective level.

The most drastic change comes from the costume department. The citizens of Gilead are all required to wear uniforms which reflect their place in the social hierarchy. Men largely don military-type uniforms, while women wear dresses of various colors: brown for Aunts, blue for Wives, black for Widows, and white for Daughters; dresses striped red, blue, and green for Econowives; red habits with white headresses (""Wings"") for Handmaids; green smocks for Marthas; gray dresses for Unwomen; and revealing vintage contraband (think Playboy bunnies and cheerleaders) for Jezebels. These outfits can be seen in the film, but with modifications.

Take the Handmaid's uniform, for example. As envisioned by Atwood, the Handmaid's habit (a type of sack-like dress) is almost as concealing as an Islamic burqa: it covers the Handmaid from her wrists to her ankles. She also wears red gloves and stockings, so that the only pieces of flesh that are visible are her neck and face - and even those are somewhat obscured, what with the red veil and white headdress. Underneath her scarlet red habit is a white cotton underdress and bulky, oversized underwear. During the hot summers, she switches to a habit made of lighter material, but it's no more revealing than her winter wardrobe.

In comparison, the uniform worn by Natasha Richardson is relatively immodest: the hem of the habit ends mid-shin, revealing precious inches of the Handmaid's legs to hungry, sex-starved men, while the thin material gives an outline of the womanly shape beneath. Scandalous!

Worse still, there are no Wings atop Richardson's head! The Handmaid's headdress conceals her face from the prying eyes of the world - and the world from her prying eyes (much like a horse's blinders). The Wings keep Handmaids ignorant, innocent, submissive. They're an essential part of the uniform, and yet they are completely absent in the movie. I understand why; blinders must make filming an actor's facial expressions quite a difficult task, natch. Still, that's the point of the Wings - they're a tool of subjugation, keeping the wearer unaware of her very surroundings.

Even the visual difference between a Handmaid-with-Wings and a Handmaid-without-Wings is striking.

The Handmaid's isn't the only outfit that's been fiddled with. Serena Joy, too, can be seen wearing a dress that's much more revealing than Gilead's strict, Puritanical, anti-sex dress code would ever allow. While the Wives don't seem to have a singular uniform - any modest blue dress will do - it's a given that the dress shouldn't show too much skin. Yet, at one point, you can actually catch a glimpse of Faye Dunaway's cleavage - as if!

Casual filmgoers might not place much importance on these changes - but they are significant. The Republic of Gilead is an oppressive, misogynistic, uber-conservative society. Every aspect of the culture feeds into this Biblically-based repression, right down the the mandated uniforms. Given the many functions of clothing - separating citizens into rank and social function, concealing the female form, further subjugating the Handmaids in particular - you might even say that the clothing is an uncredited star of THE HANDMAID'S TALE. Or rather, it should be; in altering the clothing, the filmmakers have undermined its importance. Consequently, they have removed an especially oppressive aspect of Gilead's regime.

These ""minor"" changes only begin with the costumes. Like the clothing, many of these details implicitly or explicitly speak to the treatment of women, and in so changing these minutiae, the filmmakers detract from the feeling of stifling oppression faced by Gilead's female population.

* Women move about (relatively) freely, belying the government's actual constraints on women described so starkly in the novel.

* Commander Fred's Bible isn't secured under lock and key, but is kept out on a podium, where any uppity woman might find it.

* In the film, Commander Fred is Kate's first placement, not her third, thereby reducing the pressure on her to succeed in bearing a child.

* When Kate visits the doctor (gynecologist), the sheet separating Kate's face from her torso is gone, thereby allowing the doctor to (gasp!) look her in the eyes (and otherwise interact with her on a personal level) as he pokes and prods her naked body.

* During the initial Ceremony/rape scene, it is Offred who is crying, while Serena remains stone-faced and silent. In Atwood's version, the roles are reversed; consequently, the fundamentalist Serena is shown regretting at least one aspect of the society she fought for, while Kate once again appears detached from her body.

* The Birthing Ceremony is short one Birth Chair and, even more glaringly, Ofwarren is allowed to handle the baby afterwards. This is in contrast to the novel, where the Wife is the center of attention, to the point where her fellow party-goers act as though it is she, and not her Handmaid, who gave birth to the baby. (This sequence is quite the spectacle.)

The initial sitting room scene between Kate and Nick also undergoes a seemingly small change that in actuality alters the entire dynamic of the sequence - and their relationship throughout the film. In this scene, Kate sneaks out of her room late one night and steals away to Serena Joy's sitting room. She wants to explore her surroundings, taste a scrap of freedom, maybe even steal a small keepsake, something that won't be missed. Nick, meanwhile, has been sent by the Commander to find Kate and arrange for her to meet the Commander the following night in his office. The two interlopers, having stumbled upon one another in the moonlight, share a brief but hungry kiss.

Where the novel and film differ is in the following exchange. While Nick explains the Commander's wishes to Kate, they remain in a furtive embrace. In Atwood's imagination, Nick strokes Kate's arm as he talks; Schlndorff has Nick groping Kate's breast. Schlndorff's version throws off the power balance, making Nick seem more like a creepy pervert, taking advantage of his Commander's Handmaid. Correspondingly, Kate as played by Richardson seems less like a willing participant in the exchange and more like a victim of sexual assault, so submissive and subjugated that she's been conditioned to accept the manhandling of strangers. (Which may very well be the case, but it's not indicative of the kiss, nor of their subsequent relationship.)
In reality, this is a mutually desired interaction (and, later, a mutually desired relationship). Kate and Nick both suffer under Gilead (though Kate more so than Nick), and their relationship is a brief respite from the stifling oppression of their daily existence. The affair also offers them a small sense of control in a world in which they have none. They are dissidents, deviants, criminals, brought together by lust and loneliness. Unlike most of Gilead's arranged and prescribed human relationships, theirs is genuine - a sentiment that Schlndorff fails to convey.

These are but a few of the many changes foisted upon Atwood's novel during its metamorphosis to screenplay. Others are equally puzzling but don't fundamentally alter the tenor of the story. Moira, for instance, is introduced as Kate's newfound friend from The Red Center rather than her best friend from college. Later, Kate is shown aiding Moira in her escape from The Red Center, even though she was as surprised as everyone else when Moira turned up missing. During Kate's assignment to Commander Fred's household, he leaves town, and so Serena sends Kate back to The Red Center during his absence (so poor Serena won't have to suffer the Handmaid for naught). This struck me as an especially odd invention, since it was also somewhat unnecessary.

Even the casting is a little puzzling. I found it odd, for instance, that a brunette Faye Dunaway was cast as the blond Serena Joy, and a blond Natasha Richardson plays a brunette Kate. The significance of the characters' hair color isn't in stereotypes about blonds and brunettes, but it does go to Serena Joy's character (and hypocrisy therein): in noting Serena's hair color, Kate comments that, in ""the days before"", she naturally assumed that Serena's blondness came from a bottle. Because, well, that's the type of Christian Serena Joy was/is: do as I say, not as I do. (""Women who work outside the home are selfish, except for me; I'm making a sacrifice for the greater good. Women should not be vain and overly concerned with their looks, but hey, I'm on teevee!"") Seriously, could they not have dyed the actors' hair?

The most substantial change comes at the film's end. The novel is presented as a series of disjointed flashbacks and seemingly present-day narration; we later learn that it's all a series of recollections. THE HANDMAID'S TALEs are just that, a series of tales, with no apparent beginning (just the vague ""the days before"") and no real end, since we don't know what became of Kate (or Gilead, even, just that it eventually fell). In contrast, the film is told as a story, with a discrete beginning and end. And what an end: before her escape, Kate kills the Commander, and then is whisked away to the Western frontier by the May Day group. At film's end, we see a very pregnant Kate hiding out in a camper in the mountains, riding out the Civil War. As far as Hollywood endings go, it's not completely wrapped up, but when you compare it to Atwood's grim conclusion, the movie ending looks downright rosy.

Cumulatively, the ""minor"" changes represent a significant deviation from Atwood's story - and the sanitized Hollywood ending is an abomination. Consequently, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a dark film, but nowhere near as terrifying, oppressive and believable as the novel. If it had been crafted from an original script, I'd probably quite enjoy it - four stars, maybe? But knowing what it could have been, I'm somewhat disappointed in the on-screen outcome.

Which leaves me hoping that Joss Whedon will soon shoot a remake. (Hey, it's been nearly two decades!)",1289952000,11,13070,5.1162681669010786

385882,2,6301930789,"Although the film adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel ""The Handmaid's Tale"" features a very strong cast, it was a big disappointment to me. As someone who really enjoyed the book, I thought that a lot of Atwood's story was lost on the big screen.

The plot revolves around a martial law society that dictates fertile young women are to be captured and forced to work as handmaids/baby mommas for the rich and childless. Kate (Natasha Richardson) is one of the women captured and is renamed Offred. She serves in the home of a military commander (Robert Duvall) and his extremely bitter wife (Faye Dunaway). Kate's mission is to get knocked up as soon as possible, but her living situation is complicated when the Commander begins to take more of a personal interest in her than she (or the Commander's wife) would like. Desperate to escape and reunite with her lost daughter, Kate befriends Nick (Aidan Quinn), one of the Commander's security guards, and they make plans to run away together.

The biggest problem with the film is that so much of Kate's future is given away within the first ten minutes of the movie. The book is much more suspenseful, and it's also much more horrific and terrifying. Also, the ending of the film is considerably more uplifting than the end of the book, and I think that takes away from the heart of Atwood's story.

I see where someone else didn't like the acting, but I find it very believable. The story has a sci-fi twist, but it actually seems like something that could really take place. As in every good sci-fi, the culture and look of this world is very well defined so that the movie is believable. It's just simply fascinating on so many levels to watch this story play out.

I haven't read the book, and I can understand that the movie doesn't necessarily stay true to it. However it's still a fantastic movie. It's a major cautionary tale about what could happen if people full of hate, racism and religious ideas that twist the bible for their own purposes were to gain control of this country.

385975,3,6301930789,"No, I haven't had a chance yet to read the novel by Canadian Authoress Margaret Atwood, though I'm now inclined to do so. I understand it's become a minor cult classic; so should the film also be.

I first saw 'The Handmaid's Tale' a few years ago, late at night on some obscure cable channel on TV. It reminded me of films like 'Logan's Run' and 'Fahrenheit 451' with their respective cheezy music, plastic sets, cinder-block/plywood locations, and costumes pulled from the Goodwill racks. Not that I entirely mind that, however. The films of fantasy and science fiction and allegory that I appreciate most are the ones that are character driven. No matter that Forbidden Planet appears so ""fakey"" to us today, it's still one of the better renditions of Shakespeare's `The Tempest' extant. It's all about adjusting to the curve and developing those survival skills, don't you know?

I like this film, though it still makes me most uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the blatant misogyny and the renewal of the patriarchal society in order to implement fascist-conservative values and perpetuate the species (!). Add also the almost constant reminders of the confinement behind barricade and barbed-wire, the incessant intimidation of sweeping spotlights, or the men-all-in-black with weapons abundant. Perhaps it's the fact that food is rationed, movement is restricted, and words and behaviors are scrutinized most precisely. Racism could have been a big thing. The Commander (Robert Duvall) made allusion to it once and then let it go. It's a very White film.

Are the men-folk really in charge? Probably not. Personally, I'm more startled by the power and control wielded by Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway), the Commander's wife, or Aunt Lydia (Victoria Tennent), Instructor, Mentor and Washer of Brains. Even the ""Marthas"" in the Commander's kitchens resonate with knowledge of their superior position. That our heroine Kate (Natasha Richardson), or our tragic gender-criminal/temptress Moira (Elizabeth McGovern) demand of themselves the strength and seek the means to reject to all this both astounds and encourages me. The Men (both Aidan Quinn and Duvall) are decidedly secondary figures: After all, except for that little matter of reproduction, ""Who needs a Man?""

The Handmaid's Tale is comprised of a top-flight cast who has submitted to Director Schlondorff's carefully blended combination of quasi-futuristic angst and the familiar. I believe they saw the inherent worth in putting this effort to the screen, probably knowing it would not really register with the masses.

I think I can live with Three Stars.

386055,5,6301930789,"Margaret Atwood, a Canadian novelist (and poet) wrote the dark fantasy novel upon which this DVD is loosely based. The novel is set in The Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, or at least the parts of the US that are not radioactive. The radioactive parts are called the colonies, where bad girls are sent to die of radiation poisoning. The time is the near future, after the inevitable nuclear war, and the breakdown of government as we know it.

The society depicted in The Handmaid's Tale, DVD and novel, is a nightmare: everyone is watched by the Eyes, ,women are strictly controlled. They are forbidden to have jobs. They may have no money of their own. They are irrevocably assigned to classes.. There are, at the top, the chaste, but morally superior, Wives, almost all of whom have been rendered infertile by the inevitable nuclear war. At the bottom are the housekeepers, or Marthas, who are non-entities. In the middle are the Handmaids of the title, who are fertile, but tightly controlled.

Handmaids are forced to have sex with the Commanders, the husbands of the Wives. During this sex, the Wives are intimately present to take in any ""love"" their Commanders have to give.

The Handmaids are trained to remain unattached to the Commanders. They are prohibited from using makeup or doing anything to make themselves attractive. Handmaids are forced to turn their offspring over to the Wives. And Handmaids are never taught to read. They are left illiterate.

Kate is a Handmaid who, despite her training (read brainwashing), recalls her past, her loving husband, and her adored daughter. She tells with sparkling, and terrifying clarity, how the society came to be the way it is.

The governmental aspect of the story is instructive, but that part of the novel is almost entirely missing from the DVD.

The government is totalitarian and monotheistic. The one god is very strict, and has His Eyes everywhere. Robert Duvall, in the role of a Commander into whose home Kate is introduced, gives a Bible reading performance on this DVD that will chill the truly religious to the core.

Kate's personal story is heartrending. It reminds one of the miseries of, say, the women of Darfur. When the government breaks down, she and her husband and daughter attempt to flee to Canada. Unfortunately, they are caught. Her daughter is ""confiscated."" Her husband is taken away. She never sees her husband again.

Her ""training"" is depicted in gory detail, which is more vivid on the screen than in the book.

386056,3,6301930789,"Taken on its own, this is a reasonably enjoyable movie. Some social collapse turns the US in the Nation of Gilead, a brutal theocratic oligarchy. With the social collapse, there was some ecological collapse as well, leaving ""one in a hundred"" (so they say) women able to conceive. Those fertile few are forced into service, to ensure heirs to oligarchs - male ones, of course - with barren marriages.

Fay Dunaway plays the scheming wife behind The Commander (Robert Duvall). Natasha Richardson takes the role of Kate, or ""offred"" as she is called in her position as human brood mare. The cover of this DVD gives a hint of what's inside. Richardson has an unusual face, with equal parts strength and fragility in it. It makes her unique - not ""pretty"", but beautiful in a way all her own. The cover picture has airbrushed Richardson's charm into a standard, Barbie-doll look, and lost everything in that face that made it real. That's kind of what they did to Atwood's book, too. They jammed it into the conventional mold with a happy ending (or happy enough). That Procrustean fit required a fair bit of trimming - as with Richardson's face on the cover, they discarded everything about the book that made it so memorable.

If you haven't read the book, it's a fair movie. If you have read it, don't get your hopes up.

There are some pretty awful book-to-movie adaptations out there, and I'm pleased to say that this one is hardly the worst.  Its major shortcoming could have been easily avoided, and if indeed it had, I should have called this a very good adaptation.  But what was for the most part a powerful movie became almost comical towards the end.

The movie's creators indulged themselves in a much happier ending to the story, which while satisfying, completely obliterated the story's message.  When Offred is contacted by the Mayday rebels, there is an added twist:  she is tasked with assassinating the Commander.  She does this, and is then whisked away by the rebels to a safe location in the Appalachian mountains.  Once the movie has committed this sin against the book, it goes even further with a horrendously sappy love scene between Offred and Nick, where they must be separated and Offred says ""No, I want to go with you!""  It's really quite funny.

There are a few smaller problems with the movie, as well.  Offred's real name is given as ""Kate,"" which isn't her name in the book (read carefully, it is given).  Furthermore, the book used an exceedingly subtle way of giving Offred's real name, and the movie was in no way so subtle.  Also, in the film, Offred and Nick fall in love, which most definitely didn't happen in the novel.

All in all, I can see the temptation that this film's makers gave in to, having Offred slit the Commander's throat.  All the same, it really destroys the meaning of the story, which depends on a portrayal of Offred as a human being--not merely as a vehicle for political commentary, as some seem to think.",1127433600,6,1706,4.677852348993288
386058,5,6301930789,"This is a successful adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel.
What needs to be understood with adaptations, first and foremost, is that you are creating essentially a new work of art when you adapt from another medium. In this, Schlondorf was successful. He managed to create something new and yet maintain the same, chilly, anti-life atmosphere of the novel.

Another issue viewers need to grasp is that the emotionally frigid atmosphere was precisely what existed in the fictional world of Gilead created by Atwood in the first place.

The use of color, in the choice of sets and costumes, was also true to the feeling of the novel without trying to copy that work of art. It is the feelings that count, and Volker Schlondorf managed to capture this atmosphere of Gilead in his film. The casting was brilliant and highly effective. Natasha Richardson, Faye Dunaway, Duvall and all the others solidly portrayed Atwood's characters and brought this dystopia to life on the screen for all to see and ponder.

 The real question is: where are we headed, now that the impossiblly bleak future is faced before us in stark contrast to that which we may prefer, and will it be utopia or dystopia? Is a world fit for human beings not worth pursuing?",1124582400,3,1240,4.807511737089202

Although the concept of widespread infertility due to pollution and the resulting enslavement of fertile women is intriguing, this movie really fails to capitalize on the possibilities.  Rather than explore the Orwellian experience of fear and isolation, the viewer is fed a depressing load of leftist propaganda about the dangers of people who own a Bible.  Strong acting and a captivating story may have been able to distract from the impression that you're watching a commercial for Planned Parenthood, but sadly the film has neither of these.  Instead, we're treated to (read: asked to endure) an acting performance from Natasha Richardson the caliber of which hasn't been seen since I got rid of my Darth Vader carboard stand-up in college.

The end result of your 2 hour investment are the life-changing realizations that men are bad, Christians are bad, and Robert Duvall has been in some movies of really shaky quality.  For some top-notch Duvall, see Secondhand Lions, Apocalypse Now, or the Godfather instead.

i however do not admire atwood as much as everyone else seems to. the novel is good but wholly unoriginal and platent plagerism. The book borrows and steals heavily from other writers. not that that is all bad, intertextuality is good and the way she plays with the room 101 thing in her link to 1984 in chapter 37 is fantastic. but everyone keeps going on about the flashback idea, and existence through a narrative that slips and slides in time. people seem to think this is her idea, Well thats rubbish. Joseph Heller uses similar techniques and it is plain to see that Kurt Vonneguts Slaughter House 5 is a far superior example. however none of this is the plagerism i mentioned. many writers borrow eachothers ideas it happens all the time it is very rare to discover an original idea. However far from being original Margaret Atwoods novel is basically a re-write of John Wyndham's novel THE CHRISILIDS. it has the same palimpsest theme with the perversion of the bible. the idea of 'unwomen' and 'unbabies' is from him and a bleak dystopian regime to the back drop of nuclear disaster is also Wyndham's idea. Atwood has just taken his idea and tacked feminism on the side. The HAndmaids Tale should be called MEN ARE BAD... THE NOVEL.

386171,3,6301930789,"As can be seen in the other reviews, this is an adaptation (though some prefer the word mutilation) of the novel by Margaret Atwood.  Issues of gender, religious ""fundamentalism"", and personal freedom/autonomy play a large part in constructing the film.  Moreover, post-apocalyptic themes (the prominent role of procreation, for example) mingle with authoritarian/big-brother ones, creating a rather compelling and apt atmosphere in our own controversial times (though the book was published in 1986 and the movie was released in 1990).

In terms of the film itself, as I mentioned before, it is visually flat.  Scenes are industrial and muted (black and gray cars; desolate, industrial scenes, and a shunning of panaromic shots), contrasting with the garb of the women (blue for the wealthy wives, red for the handmaids).  There are only a few shots that bring any depth to the film, with a result that the color scheme seems overused and pedestrian.

The acting is good, with Duvall bringing some complexity to his character.  Unfortunately, Natasha Richardson doesn't bring much to her character, only shining periodically through the film.  She seems neither overwhelmed nor angered by what is happening to her in the story.  While there are excellent scenes by all of the actors and actresses, there just don't seem to be enough of them.

For myself, the real value of the film is not the cinematography or the acting, but the ways in which it makes one consider the present and the future.  Basically, does this movie portray a future that is possible, and what would lead to such a possibility?

386175,2,6301930789,"I first read Margaret Atwood's book The Handmaid's Tale for a women's studies course at my local community college and I enjoyed it very much. It is a very important work, much in the same vein as Orwell's ""1984,"" but more hopeful, and told from the perspective of a woman. However, the movie was a huge disappointment and loses much of Atwood's message.
A quick overview of the story: Offred is a Handmaid in a futuristic, dystopian society known as Gilead. The birthrate in Gilead is very low due to severe toxic pollution, and so the remaining fertile women are selected to be Handmaids whose sole purpose is to become pregnant by the upper class men (called Commanders). As soon as they provide their Commander with a child, they are packed off to another household to do it all again. If they are ever unable to bear more children, they will more than likely be labeled ""Unwomen"" and shipped away to a work colony to die. Handmaids are not allowed to read, and can only leave the house with permission. The book consists mostly of Offred's thoughts about her former life and her current position. There are hints of a resistance movement, but no one in this world can ever be sure that anyone else is trustworthy. Offred does not know what is real, or what is safe, and lives in constant fear. The regime has made it illegal for a man to be termed infertile, so if a Handmaid has no children, it is blamed on her without question. Offred's Commander is obviously incapable of fathering children, and she faces relocation to the colonies if she does not conceive. As her time runs out, the suspense builds to a crescendo of urgency and terror.
The film does not capture the full horror of the world Offred, the story's main character, lives in. In the movie she appears to have almost unrestricted freedom of movement, able to wander about the house and even leave it without permission (for example, she just trots off to the Red Center one day and spends the night - this never happened in the original story), whereas in the book she was monitored constantly. There is also absolutely no reference to the Handmaids not being allowed to read, so a viewer that has not read the book would likely wonder at the significance of the scene where the Commander presents Offred with a magazine as a gift. Offred also smiles quite often in the movie, and there are no allusions to her frequent thoughts of suicide, which are readily apparent in the novel.
My biggest disappointment with the movie, however, was the altered ending. Atwood's book leaves us wondering, and actually gives the reader the task of creating the end of the story themself through the way they choose to live their life. The movie, however, provides us with a very neat, tidy, pretty little ending that allows the viewer to forget all about the characters without a twinge of conscience - they're obviously ok, right? So what's that got to do with my life? The movie ending does nothing to make the viewer think or realize that if we aren't careful right here and now in our own lives, everything might not turn out so prettily. There is no lesson, or moral to the story, when Atwood very plainly intended for her work to pack a real punch.
I really don't think the novel is even a good candidate for adaptation into a movie, because the book is very slow, centering mostly around Offred's thoughts. She cannot do much, so most of the time she just sits in her room, and it is her contemplations during this time that make up the bulk of the writing. It would be very hard to accurately represent the novel in film without making the movie boring. The director of this film obviously realized this and so he spiced it up and tried to make it into an action movie. It just doesn't work.
To make matters worse, the acting in the film is very wooden. Natasha Richardson, who plays the main character, is particularly unconvincing. It is hard to feel for the characters because they just don't seem real. The whole atmosphere of the film is stiff and unnatural.
Nevertheless, before I close, I would like to point out the few things I actually did like about the movie (and hence why I'm giving it two stars rather than just one):
The scene depicting the monthly ""ceremony"" is particularly moving. It is rather hard to watch, but I believe it really captures the event as described in the novel. I particularly liked the fact that the camera focuses for a moment on Serena Joy at the end of the scene, showing her emotions as the Wife - something we don't get so much of in the novel.
The movie also does a good job of showing the relationship between Offred and the Commander. The viewer can easily see that the Commander sees Offred as a pet - something fun to play with and indulge, but nothing he really cares about. She is like a toy for him, and one that can easily be replaced, just as Offred has replaced the Handmaid before her.
Overall, though, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It just doesn't convey the message that Atwood intended, and it's not even very entertaining in and of itself. Read the book instead. You'll get so much more out of it.",1071014400,133,5135,4.540453074433657
386176,3,6301930789,"the environment--these are the facets of a bleak existence and the movie holds true to that.  There are flashes of joy, mostly in the well-played interaction of the main character and her best friend, but these are few and far-between.  This isn't a complaint, but fair warning.
A worse flaw, for me, were the changes made to the main character, who moves from a more honest passive character in the novel to an active, at times brave/heroic character in the film.  Perhaps they thought it would have been too dark, perhaps they thought the audience wouldn't react well to a passive main character.  But it robs the story of much of its truth.  As does the ending, which without giving any details, is much less ambiguous than in the story.
If you've read the book it's worth seeing but be prepared for some disappointment. If you haven't read it, it's even more worth seeing, especially today when aspects of our lives like the Taliban and the Patriot Act make the story reverberate more, but don't expect to have a bunch of friends over for a laugh-fest.",1062028800,12,1056,4.655913978494624
386177,3,6301930789,"I watched this movie several years ago, and saw it again yesterday, after having read several reviews here.  At first glance, the movie may seem to be pro-choice and opposed to conservative religious political activism.  Certainly, the author of the book, Atwood, might fall in those categories.  Nevertheless, my second viewing in a different stage in my life, gave me a broader insight.  This movie is more about freedom of conscience than it is about politics or religion.
A previous reviewer pointed out that the national symbol of the Republic of Gilead (the theocratic state in which the story is situated) is more Masonic than Christian, and that the rebels are Baptists.  Perhaps, these choices are due to Masonry's secretive nature and its male-only membership.  Additionally, traditional Baptists opposed standardized creeds and centralized denominational polity.
Ironically, the Handmaid's Tale message to religious people is quite similar to Jesus' approach--we are to win disciples, not conquer territories.
Though the plot and themes of the story were most intriguing, the tempo of the story was flat.  I was often curious about what would happen to characters, and how things would turn out, but I was never drawn or gripped.  There was little tension or suspense.  I dare say the acting was under-dramatic.
Bottom-line:  The story is an interesting conversation starter, and offers much food for thought.  Nevertheless, the acting was overly subdued and underwhelming.",1058745600,,1484,5.353448275862069

Like Huxley's Brave New World, it is a scary vision of a possible future in which birth is regulated by the government.  Unlike Huxley, however, The Handmaid's Tale is also a vision of something far worse--what happens when religion is twisted around and used as a means to force people to do something they don't wish to do, especially if said religion controls the State.  Whether it's Christianity or New Age, or any other religion for that matter, a religion-controlled State can be a very bad thing.
The actors in The Handmaid's Tale are a very good bunch.  Natasha Richardson as Kate/Offred turned in a stunning performance, as did Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall as Serena Joy and the Commander.  Aidan Quinn was excellent as Nick, and I loved Elizabeth McGovern's scheming, wily Moira.  Victoria Tennant gave me the chills in her role of Aunt Lydia, and the role of Ofglen, though small, was wonderfully handled by Blanche Baker.

But I am not surprised anymore by ignorant people harping on about the USA already being ""controlled by Christian fundamentalists"" or the ""shock horror"" of such coming to pass.
Anyway, for anyone who cares to notice, the insignia (eye and pyramid) of the movie's Republic of Gilead (located somewhere in present day America) is what is commonly known as the sign of the Freemasons secret society as well as the New Age movement. Thus the Gilead in the movie is really a depiction of what could happen if a secret society with all its intra-society obligations and weird rituals, or the ever pervasive New Age movement with its own dogma, took control, politically, socially and militarily. Obviously, elements of Taliban or Iran-like regimes are also depicted, particularly regarding the subjugation of women.
Take note of the background news flashes throughout the movie - references to the war on the borders, insurgencies by Southern Baptist guerillas (!); but all carefully sanitized news pointing to state media control as was prevalent in the Soviet Bloc and is still present in many dictatorships today.
I don't really care about Margaret Atwood's ""original intent"" or the lefties' interpretations of her work. This movie was intriguing and enjoyable for its portrayal of the desire for freedom (personal, social, religious) that runs fiercely in any human being that cares. It's interesting that this movie came out the same year as Not Without My Daughter, based on the real-life experiences of an American woman trapped by her marriage to a Muslim in oppressive Iran.

Margaret Atwood wrote a fantastic monologue focussing on the struggles of an american woman, same as many others, who is trapped in a dystopic society (or should we say, an even more dystopic one) than the one that she grew up in. Her life is in tatters, husband dead, daughter no longer recollecting her as her mother, she is in a rut. What does she do? She resists, she lives on through her memory, she remains as seperated from Gilead as she possibly can.  She does what we all can if we try, we do the human thing, we resist POWER HUNGRY WESTERN WORLD LEADERS, we live on despite ATTACKS MADE ON US, we see through the PROPAGANDA fed to us, slightly sweetened and on a spoon. She does the decent thing.

386263,4,6301930789,"This is a haunting, psychologically compelling story about what the United States might be like under a right wing, fundamentalist theocracy.  Adapted by the acclaimed playwright Harold Pinter from the novel by Margaret Atwood, this is a tale of the suppression of women by a totalitarian state called the ""Republic of Gilead.""  In some respects one is reminded of Orwell's 1984: the endless war from without, designed to keep the populace preoccupied and beholden to the state; the paucity of basic food stuffs and consumer goods expect for the ruling class, the general hopelessness, etc.  There is horrendous pollution so that most women are not fertile, yet the state needs babies for the war effort and the economy.  Consequently women's bodies are taken over by the state, and those women that are fertile are made to bear children for the sterile leaders.  Those who are not fertile are reduced to servitude.  All overt sexual expression and any kind of activity not in keeping with the strict dictates of the fundamentalist religion is forbidden, and transgressions are punishable by death, sometimes in public hangings.  In one ugly scene the handmaids themselves are made to pull the rope that attaches to the noose that strangles a wayward handmaid.  This is followed by a man accused of rape being thrown to the handmaids, who literally rip him apart with their bare hands.
Natasha Richardson has the starring role as a fertile handmaid for the Commander (Robert Duvall).  She is not artificially inseminated (presumably since that would be against the dictates of the religion, which is, by the way, a kind of repressive fundamentalist Christianity), instead there is a ""ceremony"" in which the Commander's wife (Faye Dunaway) holds her hands (as they both wear veils) while the Commander with his clothes still on--Well, one can imagine.
I read the novel some years ago and was struck not by Atwood's attack on fundamentalist Christianity as much as I was by her attack on men, period.  Harold Pinter's screenplay and Volker Schlondorff's direction emphasize the hypocrisy, willful ignorance and anti-human aspects of fundamentalism while attributing the sexism to the patriarchal religion.  What is stunningly topical (viewing this in the year of Our Lord 2002) is the parallel between the repressive fundamentalist theocracy of Atwood's vision and that of the Taliban.  The subjugation of women, using them strictly as servants or as reproductive machines, their bodies covered and their heads veiled (in bright red), is a striking bit of dead-on foresight by Atwood, Pinter and Schlondorff.  This movie was perhaps made a decade ahead of its time.
Richardson is very good in her characteristic way.  She has a quality unlike most movie stars in that she projects primarily not her looks or charisma or even her vitality, but instead her individual will, a quality that is exactly right for the part.  Faye Dunaway as the commander's wife acts out (in contrasting blue) a kind of Daughters of the American Revolution club woman mentality to a tee.  Duvall is wonderfully slimy as a warlord hypocrite always claiming to act in the name of God.  (Seems familiar.)  Elizabeth McGovern is believable as a sexy lesbian handmaid (a ""gender criminal"") while Victoria Tennant (""Aunt Lydia"") is a kind of drill sergeant housemother to the handmaids.  Aidan Quinn gets to be Richardson's heroic lover.
This may not be entirely faithful to the book, but it is a fine work in its own right.  The direction is intelligent and focused and the script by Pinter excellent.  The acting is superior all around and the story is true psychologically.  This movie is also a warning that it could happen here.",1012608000,7,3702,5.0642504118616145

Still, I felt during the entire movie as if I were being preached to by an anarchist disguised as a filmmaker/artist.  The film's far-left-wing indoctrination, or far-right, depending on how you view it, was not for me.  If the political spectrum is indeed a circle, with both of our main political parties seated toward the top of that circle, this is a story brought to us by someone at the bottom of that circle.  Right next to the Libertarians.
As someone who puts at least a moderate amount of faith in our economy, policital parties and our government in general, I recommend you do anything else besides watch this piece of paranoid propaganda.  It was a waste of my time.",1004400000,10,971,4.494318181818182
386265,4,6301930789,"This movie was very entertaining, but those who have read the book will note a handful of obvious changes. Those who have not read the book will probably find some of the terms alien, seeing as the movie does nothing to explain them. As, for the ending, readers of the book will be surprised. I don't know if Margaret Atwood approved of how they ended the movie in such a definite and different way from the book, but I think that the book is a much better way of hearing this unforgetable story. However, book or movie; it still has a wonderful plot and clever facets. If you haven't read the book, read it first. Its a lot better than the movie. I don't read books a lot, but I couldn't put it down. I applaude Margaret Atwood.",984787200,10,729,4.2898550724637685
386266,2,6301930789,"Having read the book, the film was a bit of a let down for me. It loses the seriousness of the themes it conveys by over-glamourizing the situation. In my opinion, it used more artistic licence than should be allowed, and even had major changes which undermined the whole concept of Offred NOT being a heroine, and lost the ambiguity of the ending. Whilst interesting for someone not already acquainted with The Handmaid's Tale, if you already know Margaret Atwood's novel you will be disappointed. I would reccommend reading the text to anyone who has watched the film and wants a deeper representation.",979516800,7,604,4.87378640776699
386267,2,6301930789,"This was a decent movie with fair acting and some interesting points, but it fails to go anywhere.
While we get some background on the necessity of the Handmaids, we never really learn the purpose of the war, or any details  like that.  The movie is pretty boring, with passive acting which really  doesn't stand out, and Natasha Richardson wasn't very convincing at all  that she wanted to see her daughter again.  I don't know; the book was very  good, and although the movie follows it, it lacks something, andis just a  long boring mishmash of potential.
If this is on TV, you might want to  watch, but otherwise just read the book and leave it at that.",951782400,8,657,4.508474576271187
386268,2,6301930789,"It was an okay film, in my opinion. I can see why lots of people like it, though. You need to have a certain socio-feminist perspective, really, to enjoy it. Overall, though, it's a polemic against those who espouse  conservative and/or religious values.",951177600,3,254,4.906976744186046

The plot in the movie mentioned a number of conditions that is actually happened in the past.
I woud recomend this to everyone.

7817752,5,6301930789,I saw this movie a long time ago and liked it.  I finally forced myself to buy the book but the movie was better than the book.  Forcing fertile females to have sex with the Commander and his wife.  They didn't check the males if they were fertile.  A very interesting story.,1523232000,,275,4.230769230769231

7817757,5,6301930789,"I'm just plain excited this film finally made it to a streaming format. Ever since the Hulu series came out, I've wanted to watch this move and have been out of luck finding it anywhere, library included. The second I saw this become available I bought it and watched it. I do really like this adaptation. I think it's a lot closer to the book than the Hulu series. I'm half and half over how I feel about excluding the epilogue, as the TV series did the same. In a way, that part was campy as hell, but I like that this film showed us a bit of the after. I also liked seeing the explosions and rebellion towards the end, something we have yet to see in the Hulu series. I like that the movie uses red veils rather than the white caps, because that's accurate. I also loved the birth celebration seen much much better than the Hulu series. I like that there isn't much focus on characters outside of offred. Sorry Janenine, but you annoyed me in the Hulu series.",1520467200,,962,4.262295081967213
