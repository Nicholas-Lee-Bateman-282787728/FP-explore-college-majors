1102234,5,6305972451,"This incredible film will leave you mortified. The director has taken a complex real story of law enforcement and the courts gone wrong--REALLY wrong-- and made it come absolutely alive. The director is in command of his medium. If you are a student of how to make a spell-binding documentary, this film will deliver a knockout punch!! If you are interested in human nature or the justice system-- another knockout punch!! This film takes both the intellect and the emotions on a ride down one of the dark corridors of real American cultural history.",999907200,6,550,4.861702127659575
1102235,5,6305972451,"This is an extraordinary documentary in which film maker Errol Morris shows how an innocent man was convicted of murdering a policeman while the real murderer was let off scot free by the incompetent criminal justice system of Dallas, Texas.  The amazing thing is that Morris demonstrates this gross miscarriage of justice in an utterly convincing manner simply by interviewing the participants.  True, he reenacts the crime scene and flashes headlines from the newspaper stories to guide us, but it is simply the spoken words of the real murderer, especially in the cold-blooded, explosive audio tape that ends the film, that demonstrate not only his guilt but his psychopathic personality.  And it is the spoken words of the defense attorneys, the rather substantial Edith James and the withdrawing Dennis White, and the wrongfully convicted Randall Adams that demonstrate the corrupt and incompetent methods used by the Dallas Country justice system to bring about this false conviction.  Particularly chilling were the words of Judge Don Metcalfe, waxing teary-eyed, as he recalls listening to the prosecutor's summation about how society is made safe by that ""thin blue line"" of cops who give their lives to protect us from criminals.  The chilling part is that while he is indulging his emotions he is allowing the cop killer to go free and helping to convict an innocent man.  Almost as chilling in its revelation of just how perverted and corrupt the system has become, was the report of how a paid psychologist, as a means of justifying the death penalty, ""interviewed"" innocent Randall Adams for fifteen minutes and found him to be a danger to society, a blood-thirsty killer who would kill again.

This film will get your dander up.  How the cops were so blind as to not see that 16-year-old David Harris was a dangerous, remorseless psychopath from the very beginning is beyond belief.  He even took a delight in bragging about his crime.  As Morris suggests, it was their desire to revenge the cop killing with the death penalty that blinded them to the obvious.  They would rather fry an innocent man than convict the real murderer, who because of his age was not subject to the death penalty under Texas law.  When an innocent man is wrongly convicted of a murder three things happen that are disastrous: One, an innocent man is in jail or even executed.  Two, the real guilty party is free to kill again.  And, three, the justice system is perverted.  This last consequence is perhaps the worst.  When people see their police, their courts, their judges condemning the innocent and letting the guilty walk free, they lose faith in the system and they begin to identify with those outside the system.  They no longer trust the cops or the courts.  The people become estranged from the system and the system becomes estranged from the people.  This is the beginning of the breakdown of society.  The Dallas cops and prosecutors and the stupid judge (David Metcalfe), who should have seen through the travesty, are to be blamed for the fact that David Harris, after he testified for the prosecution and was set free, did indeed kill again, as well as commit a number of other crimes of violence.

The beautiful thing about this film is, over and above the brilliance of its artistic construction, is that its message was so clear and so powerful that it led to the freeing of the innocent Randall Adams.  Although the psychopathic David Harris, to my knowledge, was never tried for the crime he committed, he is in prison for other crimes and, it is hoped, will be there for the rest of his life.  Errol Morris and the other people who made this fine film can pride in these facts and in knowing that they did a job that the Dallas criminal justice system was unable to do.

1102236,2,6305972451,"Maybe I have an unjust predjudice against The Thin Blue Line having watched it more than a decade after it was released but the whole conspiracy plot seems to have run it's course and has now been wittled down to practically nothing.  It's a documentary about the cold-blooded murder of a Texas police officer and the presumed cover-up that followed.  Randall Adams is the supposed scapegoat, a man unjustly convicted though the film did little to presuade me in one direction or the other.  So what's fact and what's fiction?  The truth is that not even the film-maker, the very talented Errol Morris, can tell you.  He relies heavily on recreations to play out the possible scenerios and we're supposed to sift through the facts we're given and come to our own conclusion.  It's obvious that the style in which this film was made went on to inspire Oliver Stone who with JFK was able to piece together and excellent cast, real footage & photos and meld them all together to form one cohesive story.  Here we're not given that much to go on, the recreations are limited to the equivalent of flash-cut photography, never giving his actors an opportunity to act and religating them to set pieces.  The most interesting aspect is that prision interviews of Randall Adams and authorities but still it's not enough to make this much more than a worth-while viewing experience on a rainy day.  I feel bad giving such an innovative documentary a poor review but the text was simply too thin for my liking.",971568000,5,1499,4.712643678160919
1102237,5,6305972451,"This superb documentary, despite being criticized for its use of fictitious re-creation scenes, provides convincing proof that a Dallas man was wrongly accused of killing a police officer.  The accused man, who had  been put on death row for 12 years, was eventually freed because of this  film.  Comprised mainly of interviews of the people involved in the murder  case (including, chillingly, the person believed to be the real killer),  the film paints a frightening picture of our justice system gone haywire.  The dramatic re-creations, complete with film-noir like camera work and  music score, to some violate the rules in documentary films, which  traditionally contain only 100% documentary footage.  Director Errol  Morris' response to the criticism was that, ""the re-creations are not  supposed to depict the truths, but the LIES people have told.

There should be a substantial amount of supplemental material available that they could have added to this disc to give more perspective on the story. As it stands all we get is a new interview with the director(which is very informative), a critical analysis by some other guy and an old 5 minute Today Show clip from 1989. It would have been great if they could have done some follow up reporting on all of the people in this film.  They don't even mention that Randal Adams died in 2010 and only make a vague passing mention of the fact that David Harris was executed in 2004!

The documentary itself is a substantial piece of work that deserves all of the praise that has been heaped on it over the years. I must say though that the repetitive music and redundant reenactments of the crime become incessant about half way through. I would have liked to see some daylight footage of the actual crime scene and Randal Adams background story could have made the film more balanced.

1102431,5,6305972451,"RANDALL DALE ADAMS was convicted of the murder of Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood in 1977 and sentenced to death.

He didn't do it. The evidence that condemned him was manufactured from a need for revenge  but it took Errol Morris 1988 documentary  The Thin Blue Line  to free him after 12 years. At one point, Adams was four days away from execution.

Morris documentary is still one of the best ever made. Unlike his previous work, The Gates of Heaven, he uses re-enactment and a minimal score by Philip Glass. Music is not used to enhance emotion, thats not Morris way. Its not necessary anyway; interviews with helpful eye-witnesses, Adams lawyers and police file evidence tell us what we need. There are also interviews with Adams and the true killer, David Harris, one of the most charming psychopaths youll ever see on film.

Harris was 16 and on probation  a fact that never came out in trial  when he gave Adams a ride. Adams had run out of gas and was walking along the road when Harris offered him a lift. They ended up having a night of beer, grass and drive-in movies. After Harris left Adams off at his hotel, he was subsequently pulled over, where he shot Wood as the officer asked for his license and registration. The kid had been driving without his lights on.

Morris, as we learn from his 2014 interview  a bonus feature on Criterions new presentation  had become a private detective after the successful debut of The Gates of Heaven. The '80s wasn't much for documentaries and he had turned to another profession to make a living. (His wife likes to point out that now entire cable channels are devoted to independent films and documentaries.) Still, Morris loved filmmaking and turned in a proposal to the Public Broadcasting System. He intended to make a film about Dr. James Grigson, a psychiatrist known as Doctor Death. Grigson was frequently used as an expert witness for the prosecution, always recommending a death sentence. Grigsons analysis of Adams took less than an hour.

Morris interview is a feature in itself as he talks about his first meeting with Woods killer, who insistently advised him to Drive safely, at the close of their conversation. Once is friendly, Morris says. Three times  a warning. True enough, Harris trailed him afterward until Morris stopped at a gas station to phone his wife in what was a very close call.

The Thin Blue Line freed Adams, who never received an apology or compensation from the state of Texas. After an initial rush of speaking engagements, he lived quietly until his death from a brain tumor in 2011. In what was perhaps the most supreme irony, Adams sued Morris for the rights to his life story as soon as he was released. It was settled out of court and Morris covers that particular heartbreak in his interview. A six-minute extra, Today: Close Up, shows a post-freedom interview between the two.

Harris was executed not long after the films debut for another murder he committed.

Morris and producer Mark Lipson supervised Criterions AVC MPEG-4 encoded 1080p remaster. Liner notes inform it was created on a Spirit 2K film scanner from the 35mm negative. Dirt, scratches and noise have been removed. Film grain is heavy, but colors are bright and natural; detail is outstanding, especially on documents where we can actually see the weave of the paper beneath the print. The new 2.0 surround soundtrack  dialogue heavy as you can guess  is clear and distinct.

Additional extras include A Radical Classic, an essay by Charles Musser, a professor of film and media studies at Yale University, and a 14 minute interview with Joshua Oppenheimer, director of The Act of Killing, who reminds us of the films significance.

True  the techniques used here are familiar to a world brought up on film fictions like C.S.I. and Law & Order. In The Thin Blue Line we learn how they can reveal a genuine truth.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,3900,4.762258543833581

THE THIN BLUE LINE: The title refers to the police force, a ""thin blue line"" between polite society and savage anarchy, but in this documentary, the phrase is used more ironically than literal. At 12:30 AM on the night of November 29, 1976, Dallas police officer Robert Wood was shot to death--apparently without provocation--by the driver of a car he had pulled over. The driver, however, swore that his hitchhiker, one Randall Dale Adams, did the deed. Adams was subsequently arrested, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to the death penalty for the crime. But was he actually guilty?

Director Errol Morris didn't believe so when he set out to make this dispassionate and objective review of the case and the facts. In doing so, he created a new movie form--investigative cinema--as well as a new role for himself: the director as detective. Using little more than interviews he filmed with everyone involved and dramatic recreations of different people's versions of the crime, Morris presents a spellbinding story of justice gone horribly--and obviously--awry.

Although the tone of the film is slow, sober and somber, as befits the subject matter, this mesmerizing movie plays more like a murder mystery than a dry documentary. Furthermore, this little film prompted a reopening of the case, which established the innocence of Randall Adams and resulted in his release from prison: a factual finale rivaling the best of Hollywood's fictional happy endings. Long before reality TV programs like ""America's Most Wanted,"" ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" ""Forensic Files,"" ""Cold Case Files"" and ""Cops"" became popular, Morris was single-handedly creating the genre--as well as its best entry yet.

A final ironic note: Although Adams was eventually exonerated, thanks in part to this film, apparently freedom wasn't enough for him: he later sued Morris to regain the rights to his own life story.",1422489600,,2146,5.088068181818182

1102590,5,6305972451,"Written and directed by the great Errol Morris, this film sets the standard for all subsequent hard-hitting documentaries. Morris himself sized it up like this: ""There are many films which tell the story of a murder investigation. The Thin Blue Line may be unique in that the film itself does not tell the story of a murder investigation; it is, in itself, a murder investigation.""

Most stories of murder and mystery can grab your attention. What sets The Thin Blue Line apart from almost all of them is that, throughout this film, you start to feel: You feel the heat of a Texas summer. You feel the dread of being an outsider . . . wrongly accused . . . of murdering a police officer . . . in a state that executes people who do that! You feel the seething anger against the guile and incompetence that makes a mere hapless drifter look like a cop killer. But do you ever feel the intense relief of a conviction overturned? Ah, that's why you've got to see this one.

What makes this film so riveting? At least a couple of things: First, the hard work of Errol Morris. Evidently, Morris is the kind of guy who knows the types of stories that interest him, finds them, and then painstakingly documents them on film. He reportedly put in 2 and a half years tracking down the various people in this film and convincing them to talk on camera. Here's a guy who cares about his craft.

After all, we are living in a time where most people (young ones and old ones) suffer from a short attention span which movie/documentary directors must be aware of.

When so many different people get interviewed, it becomes very confusing (especially in the beginning), so it wouldn't hurt if the next time a person comments again, his or her name is mentioned once more.

1103316,4,6305972451,"The film has often been likened to Akira Kurosawa's fictive film- also about a murder, Rashomon. The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of `justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line.

  The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode. And, for that trajectory, alone, the world of cinema should be grateful.",1340236800,2,2716,4.607438016528926

Why would someone blindly overlook actual evidence of the crime, but instead jump to a decision and for an innocent person into prison (or worse).

1103319,4,6305972451,"When Errol Morris was investigating a psychiatrist whose expert testimony tended to get defendants the death penalty in the 1980s, he discovered the case of Randall Adams, who had been convicted of the November 1976 shooting death of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. Morris brought his skills as a private investigator to bear on the case and became convinced that Randall Adams was innocent and that the real culprit was a witness, David Harris, then serving time on Texas' death row for another murder. ""The Thin Blue Line"" is Errol Morris' exposition of the case, though he never speaks in the film. Morris arranges interviews with the principle actors, police officers, lawyers, and witnesses, along with spare re-enactments, to lay out the facts, opinions, and legal wrangling.

Randall Adams, 28 years old at the time of the killing, tells his story. His car had run out of gas when a teenaged ne'er-do-well, David Harris, picked him up in a car the young man had recently stolen. After some driving around, taking in a movie, and expressing concern at Harris' firearms, Adams returned to the motel where he and his brother were staying. More than a month after the shooting, rumor got around that Harris has been bragging about killing a cop in Dallas. When questioned by police, however, Harris claims that Adams was driving the stolen car and shot the police officer while he looked on. They try to coax Adams into confessing. He refuses. But police insist on pursuing the case against him with only one unreliable witness as evidence.

""The Thin Blue Line"" was groundbreaking in its use of re-enactments, but it does not use them to present a particular version of the story. They seem to serve stylistic purposes, to punctuate the interviews. More recent documentaries make more extensive use of re-enactments. This film is most notable, I think, for using interviews from a variety of perspectives to tell the story, sometimes jumping around in time, as first the crime is related, then the events of the trial. Adams' defense lawyers believed that the prosecutors pursued their client rather than David Harris because Harris was a juvenile and therefore not eligible for the death penalty. Morris has a way of getting people to talk to him, and I was surprised that the endless interviews kept my interest.

There is never any text to tell the audience who is speaking, however, and it is rarely possible to catch anyone's name. This is an omission that documentarians don't make anymore. It's not always easy to figure out if the person speaking is a lawyer, a cop, or a witness. Adams and Harris stand out in their prison garb, but they aren't introduced either. The audience is just dropped into this thing. I wonder if Morris is deliberately creating confusion. It is never clear if the police and prosecutors were corrupt or just stupid in assuming Adams' guilt, nor is it clear what Morris thinks about that. In any case, ""The Thin Blue Line"" did result in the charges against Randall Adams being dropped, and its creative presentation earned it a handful of awards.

The DVD (MGM 2005): The single bonus feature is an episode from First Person TV, produced by Errol Morris, entitled ""Mr. Personality"" (28 min). It is an interview with Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist and ""expert on evil"" who studies the criminal mind, in particular the minds of killers. He explains where different types of killers fit on his ""scale of evil"", what makes a crime especially depraved, the personality traits of psychopaths, and his theories on why serial killing increased markedly in the 1960s. He's a bit kooky and seems to exhibit narcissistic traits himself. I think Morris found him amusing, but I suppose Stone does make some interesting observations.

I don't know why it took me so long, but I'm glad that I finally watched it... I thought it was amazing. Errol Morris truly shows why he's one of the most respected Documentary filmmakers of all time... all of his films have this polish and style to them that separates his documentaries from the rest. He has a way of doing reenactments in a non-cheesy and totally believable way. If I hear a documentary relies on a lot of reenactments, I usually cringe; but when I hear that for an Errol Morris documentary I get excited... The Think Blue Line is a perfect illustration of this.

The movie itself is an exceptionally interesting and thoroughly captivating story about the murder of a police officer and the ensuing investigation into it. What follows is corruption and a perfect example of when our legal system flat out fails to do its job. Very nicely done as expected... I fully recommend seeing this if you haven't already. 4/5 stars.",1294358400,3,1052,4.595744680851064

I can't believe I waited so long to sit down and watch this doc.  Artistically executed and brilliantly paced, it's an absolute compliment not only the documentary genre, but cinema as a whole.  Everything from the re-enactments to the strange collective of key players completely blew me away.

It really says something, I think, that the beauty of the film occasionally lulled me from the morose plot, too.  The backgrounds behind those being interviewed, the city-scape shots, the close-ups of articles and documents...

Such detail.

I'm gushing, I know, but I'm extremely impressed with what I just saw. And heard!  The soundtrack for The Thin Blue Line is conducted masterfully by Philip Glass.  If you're not familiar, that's okay, you will be after this.  Of course there's a mood about this film, the subject matter demands it, but Glass' contribution is paramount.  He enhanced the experience three-fold by creating a foreboding, audible undertow.  The music beckons.

This is an outstanding piece of work that most definitely deserves your gracious perusal.  Enjoy.

David Harris and Randall Adams hook up in Dallas Texas in 1976, when Adams moves down to find work.  He's traveling with his brother, and staying in a motel.  Adams' car runs out of gas, when 16-year-old Harris picks him up in a stolen car.  Adams thinks he can help Harris get a job where he has just found a job.  Instead, Harris frames him for the murder of a police officer.

Based largely upon the testimony of a pint-sized habitual criminal Harris, Adams is sentenced to death.

Errol Morris had already made several critically-acclaimed documentaries when he traveled to Texas to interview a psychiatrist, James Grigson, nicknamed 'Dr. Death' because based on virtually no evidence, he always found the accused to be a potential threat to society if he was ever released from prison.  Morris encountered the Adams murder case and became intrigued with it, believing it to be a better subject for a documentary than the one he envisioned on Dr. Death (though Grigson has a memorable interview with Randall Adams that the latter recounts for 'The Thin Blue Line.'

What a treasure!  Very Highly recommended; gets my highest rating.  It's one of the top 25 documentaries of all time, in my opinion.  'The Thin Blue Line' is really an essential film!  It will immerse you in the tale of a complete miscarriage of justice.

Update:  I've just watched this film again, just tonight, primarily because I wanted my wife to see it.  In spite of the fact the documentary was made years ago, it still is spell-binding and convincing.  One must remember this came long before the television documentaries and dramatizations of 'Law and Order' and '48 Hours' and the like put us squarely in the midst of a murder investigation.  Coupled with a score written by Philip Glass, the movie holds up very, very well and is as fascinating as ever.  As I told my wife after the movie ended, 'talk about doing something with your life' as Mr. Morris has done here.",1244246400,12,2194,4.723684210526316

1103450,4,6305972451,"Errol Morris' documentary works are unique in that one often remembers the story telling and film making techniques employed as much as the subjects being examined.  Here, for example, there's a moody Philip Glass score, artful slow-motion dramatizations of witness testimony, and- in what has evolved into a typical Morris trademark- inserts of props and old movie clips to underscore what interview subjects are saying. In one scene, for instance, we see a haunting image of a swinging watch on the end of a chain when one of the subjects discusses how the female police officer on the scene was ultimately hypnotized to help her recall details of the crime.  To his credit, however, Mr. Morris never quite lets his showmanship, as memorable as it can often be, upstage the subject at hand.  As a result, ""The Thin Blue Line"" ultimately resulted in an innocent man being set free.

Unfortunately, viewers won't learn that fact from this DVD, which includes just the movie and no further information about the wheels that were set in motion after the film was released.  The only ""extra"" here is a 27-minute episode of Mr. Morris' ""First Person"" TV interview program, which features an interview with a man who is an expert on ""extreme evil"". The interview subject spends the show enthusiastically talking about lovely folks like the Boston Strangler and Hitler, then- in the best moment of the show- suddenly gets tongue tied and is at a loss for words when Morris asks him, ""Now, what do you think there is about you that makes you so interested in heinous crimes and truly evil acts?"" It's a hoot.

In any event, the TV episode is an interesting little addition to the DVD, and it does tie in somewhat to the theme of ""The Thin Blue Line"", but I would have preferred some specific, after-the-fact information about the movie itself rather than a sample of Mr. Morris' TV show.

Still, aficionados of true-crime stories and documentary film making shouldn't hesitate to pick up this DVD.

The film is shocking in recounting the conduct of the Dallas judicial system, which came within hours of executing a totally innocent person.

Cop-bashers will find much to cheer about in this film, but I believe that ordinary law-abiding people will be challenged by the innocent mistakes  made by some individuals, as well as see first-hand that less-than-innocent ""shortcuts"" to justice as well as outright fraud that nearly took the life of Randall Adams.

1103452,5,6305972451,"Not many films can be credited with saving a man's life.  One night in 1976, police officer Robert Wood was shot during a routine traffic stop.  One of the occupants of the car, Randall Adams, a man with no record, was sentenced to death for the murder.  The other occupant, David Harris, went free and remained free despite facts that pointed toward his guilt.  Eventually, he was imprisoned for another murder.

The combination of coincidence, complacense, laziness, and dishonesty that conspired against Adams is frightening to behold.  Intrigued by the case, documentarian Errol Morris investigated, uncovering numerous lies and misstatements on the part of witnesses, which the police themselves could presumably have uncovered with their greater resources had they made the necessary effort.  It is clear from their interviews, however, that the authorities are not interested in revisiting this case; in fact, they have a great deal of professional reputation invested in Adams's conviction.

This is a deeply ethical use of the film medium.  By the end of the film, where Harris confesses to the murder that Adams was convicted for, I was stunned by the degree of injustice inflicted on Adams and humbled by a disquieting sense that there must be many similar stories on Death Row.  In one sense, Adams is the luckiest man on Earth for having received such an advocate as Morris.  How many have been executed with no one to believe their innocence?

A stunning documentary by Errol Morris which was absurdly written off as ""pseudo-journalism,"" and ""overly-subjective,"" by the critics at the time. Morris makes no pretense of being ""objective,"" with his topic; in fact, the actual topic of the film is subjectivity. A man is convicted for murder in Texas on extremely thin evidence but the opaque wheels of justice simply crank him into death row without a second thought. Morris worked as an investigative journalist in uncovering the man's innocence, made the film, and eventually got his conviction overturned because of its persuasiveness. Scenes of the crime are reconstructed and dramatized by Morris to fill in the point of view of the interviewee (not to demonstrate the truth), and the film gradually and compellingly puts together the missing fragments of the case, and turns truth on its backside. This is a brilliant documentary, and I'm not employing hyperbole when I say it is the In Cold Blood of the cinematic form.",1130457600,5,1012,5.059880239520958
1103583,3,6305972451,"Way ahead of its time--although by no means the first documentary made in the US (that honor belongs to Nanook of the North, made in the 1920s)--this had huge chunks of impact on cop show TV, reality TV, talk show TV, and documentary films as well. Made in 1988, this depicts the slaying of a Texas police officer by one of two men in a car, pulled over in 1976 at night on a Texas highway.

While this is unquestionably a piece of filmmaking that is like nothing else before it, it's frankly pretty tough to watch--not because of the violence (what's portrayed is not really gruesome or severe), but because of the massive amount of total stupidity and callousness on display. It's just not fun to watch. With the exception of three lawyers--the woman defense attorney, and the two male defense attorneys--everyone else, bar none, comes off as either stupid, callous, ignorant, devious, defensive, or just plain...well, stupid. Dumb. This does not exclude a high ranking Texas court official.

It's chilling to think that law enforcement and the justice system are so full of idiots, but there's no getting around it. They are. To be fair, one law enforcement official, from Vidor, Texas, does present himself with some intelligence and that was refreshing, because no one else does.

Just because a documentary is the truth does not mean it should not be entertaining. Four great examples of the latter are ""Supersize Me"", ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" (disgused as a feature film, but really a documentary), ""Roger and Me"", and ""The Corporation"". All of these reveal things we didn't know before and a number of them--especially in ""The Corporation""--are absolutely enraging. But ""The Thin Blue Line"" does not enrage or stimulate or provoke thought.

What it does do is to depress the viewer with the monumnentally massive degree of idiocy present in the U.S. system of justice. No doubt that is the intent, so, fine, it succeeds at what it intends to do. But a whole lot of it is, frankly, boring. Very dull. Tedious.

The Philip Glass score does help, especially when there are scenes or sections that reveal tragic events. This is a great match of sound and image. But Morris' overly cute David Lynch-inspired ""object details"" don't help at all in relieving the tedium; in fact, they increase it. He cuts from yet another monotone-droning person talking on and on about some detail of the crime to another re-enactment of the crime, over and over. The crime is re-enacted not less than about seven times, probably more, in the course of the film. This itself gets pretty tiring.

This is basically for huge fans of Errol Morris or of documentaries. Or both. For a far superior documentary with a crime basis, see ""Brother's Keeper"" made by Jay Berliner, about five brothers living in poverty, in their 50s, in a small upstate New York village. THAT is a truly compelling crime-based documentary. This one, ""The Thin Blue Line"", is probably the grand-daddy of contemporary U.S. crime documentaries, but is not really compelling.

1103584,5,6305972451,"Without going into spoilers or repeating the last few other reviewers, what might remain to be said about ""The Thin Blue Line"" is that it certainly deserves a place in the death penalty debate. Anyone who has watched Morris' later documentary ""Dr. Death"" can guess his view of the death penalty, but this documentary is the more effective argument against it. Because of the convoluted regard for capital punishment cases, the guilt or innocence of Randall Adams is decided based on what punishment the state of Texas was pursuing at the time. One might naively think that the added stakes of a capital punishment would make Adams harder to convict, but the documentary shows that instead of a more intense scrutiny of the evidence, the police/DA get tunnel vision and the legal machine falls in lockstep. The detectives, judge and (most grotesquely) the forensic psychiatrist seem to expose themselves and their end of the government. I get the impression the Adams isn't telling the whole truth (or Morris isn't showing it), but the theme is laid out beautifully, building from beginning to end.

Why is this movie so shocking?  Why are there so many people outraged over the wrongful conviction of an innocent man?  Could it be because he's not black?  The Thin Blue Line is a movie about the murder of a Dallas police officer in 1977, and the wrongful conviction of a white man (a drifter and outsider to Dallas) by white police officers, a white DA, and a white jury, who sentence the drifter to death for the killing.  The basic message is that the Texas criminal justice system is hell, even if you're white.

I was born in Houston, TX about a year after the events in the movie took place.  I moved to Southern California when I was 7.  I'm so glad I did, because I might have turned out an absolute braindead hick like most everyone interviewed in this movie.

It's supremely frustrating to watch because you listen to these people and they're so sure of themselves, while they're talking complete bull****.  The arresting officers are so blind to the facts, it's amazing... and the witnesses are complete wastes of humanity (when you watch the movie, you'll understand).  The Vidor detective who befriends David Harris (the actual killer) shows no regret at all for his failure in getting David off the streets, a failure which ultimately leads to the death of David's last robbery victim.  And the judge is absolutely delusional about his own incompetence/blindness/partiality.  He sits there and claims to be impartial and carrying out justice, while basically presiding over a show trial in which he actively participates in convicting an innocent man and sentencing him to death.  What's scarier is the fact that the Texas Appellate court, the highest court in Texas, sides 9-0 with the state, basically saying there is nothing wrong with how the trial judge acted.  The Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court in the frikkin country, comes down 8-1 in favor of the appellant and reverses the case, and the bastard judge has the audacity to say ""well, if you add up the votes, nine TX appellate judges and one Supreme Court justice for me vs. eight Supreme Court justices agin', I got 10 to 8 in favor of me, so I was right"".  What a bastard.

In an episode of Errol Morris' show 'First Person', he interviews a defense attorney who says something along the lines of ""it's good if your client is innocent, it's better if you can prove it, but it's best if you know the judge.""  It's a sad truth about our criminal justice system, and watching The Thin Blue Line makes one think about how fair our system really is... or maybe Texas just sucks.

And I'm sure this type of ""miscarriage of justice"" is suffered everyday by black defendants, but who's making movies about that, thems just the way things is ain't it?",1125964800,4,2766,4.6894409937888195
1103587,5,6305972451,"... to an old theme. I remember, in ""Fury"" (a movie half-a-century older) the phrase : ""he's guilty, he's been convicted by a court of justice"". Here, you can see a court of injustice who has a single motto : ""he's suspect, so we have to make him legally guilty and condemn him; therefore, any testimony not fitting this purpose is not admissible"". And, if reliable witnesses want to speak up, they will be held in contempt (although judge, D.A., and their paid witnesses did more than enough to deserve this contempt).

Just one thing keeps bothering me : although the United States Supreme Court granted Adams a stay, and on June 25, 1980 ruled 8 to 1 that Adams deserved a new trial, they should have ruled as well that those who fabricated the case be put in jail until a complete and unbiased inquiry has been performed. Since they did not, it only proves that if ""Justice"" is blind, it's because it's wanted this way.....

1103589,5,6305972451,"Innocence and guilt are two opposite facets in regards to the consequences of an individual's actions in a specific incident.  Usually, guilt and innocence are related to the justice system in the United States and the rest of the world.  In the best interest of society this concept should be balanced fairly and justly without any consideration of human emotion or concern, or it could have a dire aftermath for people.  The familiar blindfolded statue in the courts throughout the United States that holds a scale in one hand and a sword in the other symbolically demonstrates the fair blindness of true justice.  Nonetheless, there are people who end up behind bars while society points them out as guilty despite innocence.  The Thin Blue Line tells such a tale of a true incident where justice was put aside and a human decision was based on personal feelings while gains took precedence.

The documentary opens with a couple of shots of Dallas, Texas, where Randall Adams discloses why he came to town.  This is also followed by David Harris providing the reason of how and why he came to Dallas as a sixteen year old.  Both of them disclose how they met, which seems to be the only version that seems genuine in regards to the beginning of a dreadful police murder.  The story goes into great detail to provide the contrasting elements, as Adams tells his version and the police officers on the case reveal their facts.  In addition, Harris's version offers the audience a third and slightly different narration of the account of the police murder.  Their stories are cleverly incorporated with a reenactment of the crime scene where Adams supposedly shot the police officer.

All of the interviews in the documentary are provided through first person monologues where individual's various importance disclose their connection with the case.  These people are suspects, witnesses, judges, police officers, and lawyers.  The audience can quietly sit and watch their reactions and facial expressions while they give their testimony.  It is an intriguing approach, as Morris lets the audience use the same manipulation of facts by reading meaningless stimuli such as facial expressions and voices regardless of Adams innocence or guilty.  Even one of the police officers points out Adams' emotionally blas behavior in regards to the murder and suggests that he was guilty due to his lack of remorse.  Later in the documentary, Adams' defense lawyer points out that an innocent would not show any remorse, because they have nothing to feel sorry about.  Thus, in an intelligent way Morris turns the tables on the audience by using first person interviews with the camera.

There is a thorough investigation of what would the state gains to give the ruling guilty to Adams.  There are several intriguing facts that are revealed such as the merciless prosecutor Douglas Moulder who has never lost a case, the competitive nature of a judge stating he won against the supreme court, and ""the Killer Shrinks.""  There is also the questioning of the validity of testimonies provided at the court while the defense lawyer has been portrayed as an Eastern educated liberalist to a high seat of the Ku Klux Klan.  This is not to mention Davis' criminal background and the reason he was in Dallas.  It is a sad mess of injustice that emerges when viewing this film, however, hopefully this film could function as a tool to improve the legal system of this nation.

In an interview with judge Don Metcalfe, he restates how the the final argument by Douglas Moulder emotionally affected him, which stated, ""the thin blue line of the police that separated the public from anarchy.""  It is with a grave sense of irony that this judge makes this statement, as he crossed the line when he heard it.  The blind objectivity of justice seems to have heavily leaned on subjective reasoning for a large number of reasons, and it seems like Adams has been caught between personal desires and the legal system.  Errol Morris does a fascinating job of directing this film where he captures human subjectivity at the core of humanity and its dire aftermath, which will linger within the viewer for many years to come.",1123200000,9,4195,4.9134751773049645

The Thin Blue Line is a different matter. This movie fundamentally affected at least one person's life in an irreversible way. Without giving away the plot, Randall Dale Adams will certainly never be the same.

The movie deals with the killing of a Texas Trooper and whether or not Texas justice got it right. Morris reveals the facts of the case using strange and haunting reenactments to cover multiple stories and exploring what people said vs. what the physical evidence suggested. He does not push a viewpoint but carefully crafts it, allowing you to accept or reject the various positions. Soon, you are drawn into the central issue of guilt or innocence and the many areas of gray in between.

It's a documentary that plays like a murder mystery, but it is frighteningly true. It's burned as much into my mind because of the number of high-profile cases in Texas where people were either in prison on death row despite being innocent; CBS news magazine 60 Minutes profiles many of them.

But you do not have to have an attitude toward the death penalty to be drawn to The Thin Blue Line. It is entertaining in and of itself. Errol Morris fans will enjoy experiencing one of his earlier works. It also features what I think is one of the better Philip Glass scores.

If you're looking for violence, sex, car chases, or explosions - stay away, you'll hate this. But if you can handle a movie that is more seductive than explosive, this is for you. The final scene -- where a handheld tape recorder sits on a table and plays part of an interview - will chill you to the bone.

1103706,5,6305972451,"This film sums up my love-hate relationship with Errol Morris's work.  First of all, one has to acknowledge right at the outset that, on purely aesthetic terms, this is an absolutely brilliant piece of work.  It is hands down one of the most fascinating pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen and manages to turn the normally staid documentary format into an utterly unique cinematic experience.  Morris makes pseudo-filmmaker Michael Moore's work look like the sophomoric video camera-wielding amateurism that it is.  This is the work of a truly gifted filmmaker, which is both the strength and weakness of this film.

It is precisely because of Morris's amazing talent, and the raw emotional impact that his talent brings to bear on the viewer, that one is inevitably left with the feeling that the experience of watching his films is not a completely fair one.  In short, and this has been mentioned as a criticism of this film before, Morris is a highly talented manipulator of images, and one cannot but feel manipulated by those images when one is watches his films; to the point where you begin to question the thematic subjects of his films even while being utterly dumbfounded at the skill with which they are presented.

This situation is even more difficult in THE THIN BLUE LINE because it seems fairly obvious that Morris's premise as to the innocence of his film's subject is correct.  This leads to the feeling that one is being manipulated in the direction of something which ultimately is true; which makes one feel guilty for feeling manipulated and yet angry at feeling used by the artist even in the service of truth.  I say this especially because the political/cultural agenda of this film is fairly obvious.  Morris is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts; I grew up near there and I know the culture pretty well.  On a basic level, this film is another East Coast elitist looking down his nose at Southern barbarism and ""Texas justice""; as if there were no miscarriages of justice or mistakes by the justice system in his part of the country (hello, Willie Horton). Morris's political/cultural agenda becomes more obvious in some of his other works (especially in THE FOG OF WAR); but its certainly present here and it is, frankly, fairly off-putting and undermines what he is trying to accomplish with the film.  I was especially forced to wonder, while watching this film, whether Randall Adams's innocence and David Harris's guilt were really as obvious at the time as Morris makes them out to be.  In particular, the part with the judge was extremely unfair; this guy thought, in all sincerity, that he was dealing with a cop killer (Adams was convicted by a jury, after all, and not the judge) and expressed perfectly understandable emotions in that context.  Morris fairly coldly makes him out to be a fool, which I think he pretty clearly wasn't.  There is also the fact that Harris, while he did have a criminal record, was 16 years old and had nothing approaching cold blooded murder in his past; I'm not sure it would have been nearly so clear at the time that he was the killer.

These reservations aside, this film clearly made a great contribution to the cause of justice in freeing an innocent man, and is a unique and brilliant piece of work by one of America's most talented filmmakers.  I only wish that Morris, and I say this in relation to his other films as well, had the courage to point his unrelenting eye at himself once in a while.",1098230400,10,3476,4.757071547420965
1103707,5,6305972451,"Great documentary. At first I thought some of the characters were purposely cast in the film just to make it funny until I realized it was a true documentary. Hard to believe people like that actually exist.

Randall Adams comes off as understandably angry and David Harris is suprisingly likeable.

1103708,5,6305972451,"Errol Morris is one of the few filmmakers who allows real people to speak their voices.  One can tell when seeing his documentaries that the people speaking are talking from their hearts and minds, and not reading a screenplay or Q-card.  In his movies, one can sense a level of rawness not found from other filmmakers.  In 'The Thin Blue Line', Morris tries to aquit an innocent man of murdering a police officer.
The story is told in a breath-taking fashion, with Morris going back to the scene of the crime and telling it from as many viewpoints as possible.  When doing this, he also exposes the manipulative nature of people, showing how they will go to great lenghts to save themselves and make a quick dollar.  The subject matter might bore some people after a while, but the last interview with the real killler at the end of the film is simply haunting and unforgettable.",1085529600,8,880,4.615384615384615

Yes, this film clearly shows through interviews (new testimonials?), visuals, re-enactments, and other evidence that the innocent CAN go to jail and even death row.  It is a sad justice system, but it still doesn't dissuade me from the death penalty to those that are guilty and deservant of their crime.

Despite the inherent human fallibility of our criminal justice system, somehow we manage to maintain the preconceived notion that it could never convict an innocent person--at least not of murder.  The Adams case ranks very high on the list of miscarriages of American ""justice,"" and this documentary does an exceptional job of showing (1) that Adams was indeed innocent and yet convicted of murder and sentenced to death and (2) that this sort of case can easily happen in a system operated by inept, corrupt, or simply mistaken human beings.  Adams very easily might have been executed, and his case should be studied--and this film viewed--by anyone who supports the death penalty in a system run by people.",1068163200,5,843,4.964539007092198
1103713,5,6305972451,"Spoiler Alert.

Going into this film, I had no prior knowledge as to the most recent developments.  I went into it expecting a manipulative, anti-cop documentary utilizing fancy storytelling and cinematography.  The first half seemed to prove me right.  Then we got to the three supposed witnesses.  The bleached-blonde woman had mannerisms and expressions to the face that were undoubtedly that of a psychologically abnormal person.  I've dealt with several individuals exactly like her and immediately knew she could not be trusted.  Then we find out the circumstances surrounding her ""testimony"", which totally verified this.  The African American man, who was in the other car, kept covering his face, while his eyes watered and he looked frightened.  Any polygraph expert on the planet would have seen through this behavior even without his equipment.  These two also had the telling habit of saying ""I like helping the police; I have extra-ordinary memory.""  If this wasn't enough already, ""Doctor Death"" gives the accused an under 20 minute pseudoscientific personality evaluation, which is used to conclude he'd kill again.  At the same time that was occurring, the very person who originally pointed the finger at him is out conducting armed robbery, attempted rape, and finally homicide, which hilariously he blames on the dead man for defending himself -- a common response from apathetic criminal minds.  Morris caps all this off with the perfect ending: ... The fact that this director could so easily fool me early on, then gently change my mind shows just how talented he is.  The film stands as damning evidence against Texas and southern ""justice"".",1020902400,23,1665,5.2105263157894735
1103714,5,6305972451,"I am a movie buff from Widener University, who bought this documentary on VHS as an afterthought while buying two other critically acclaimed docs, Streetwise and Gates of Heaven (both given 4 stars by Roger Ebert, who's like a second father to me). Although some people might not like the fact that this VHS version was pan-and-scan, the visual impact of the filmed interviews as well as the soundtrack still shines through. Anyone who wonders why so many people oppose the death penalty should see this film. People who have served jury duty (or are considering it) will also benefit. The Thin Blue Line not only shows how justice can miscarry all too easily, it makes its viewers get to know the interviewees all too well. Errol Morris's reconstructions of the different versions of Officer Wood's murder show up the inconsistencies of the witnesses' testimony so strongly that the real murderer, David Harris (who was only sixteen when he shot Wood)confessed to the crime. Of course by then Harris had nothing further to lose; he was already on Death Row for a subsequent murder. I would be surprised if Roger Ebert didn't raise his rating for this doc from 3 1/2 stars to four and include it in his list of ""The Great Movies.""",1017100800,32,1230,4.752336448598131

It begins with stories of police mis-behavior in big cities: planted evidence, beatings, etc. There is an outbreak of a disease at an American Legion Convention in Philadelphia. Food poisoning? [It was called Legionnaires Disease to hide the name of their hotel.] The Philadelphia Examiner assigns one reporter to cover a hundred courtrooms. Jonathan Neumann is a new reporter for the Examiner. Benjamin Franklin used to work there. Frank Rizzo is Mayor. Was there a wrongful conviction? A suspect was beaten to get a confession. There was a lost statement that contradicted testimony in court. A witness was beaten to get a changed testimony. This is printed. There was a batch of cases where evidence was suppressed. What happened to these cases? Watch your back!

A car with two men follow Neumann. The police harass a civilian with a car stop. Somebody vandalized his apartment! Are the Philly police breaking laws? The eighth floor of City Hall is unlisted. There is a hidden door, they find the hidden files! Two police detectives threaten Jonathan. Can the reporters polygraph suspects to verify their claims? Jonathan goes to the eighth floor again, then finds a witness to a beating. An earlier reporter disappeared without collecting his paycheck! This results in a series of articles. Mayor Rizzo is angered! He threatens the reporters. Police detectives threaten Neumann. He interviews Rizzo and records his answers. The US Justice Department charged Rizzo and the Police department with crimes. Rizzo retired from politics. Police detectives were convicted.

This is a fictionalized account of the Philadelphia police department in the 1970s. What is the real cause of police brutality? There was no mention of the Ruling Class, those who control the political parties and politicians like puppets. Usually its the wealthy who do this. What are the major industries and businesses in Philadelphia? In the past Philadelphia was infamous for its water, drawn from the Schuylkill River. This city had the highest death rates during the Great Flu Epidemic of 1918, and had suffered from epidemics of Yellow Fever in the late 18th century. It was once the great city where the US Constitution was created. The Erie Canal helped to make New York City the premier city on the east coast because of this connection to the mid-west and its agricultural products. Machiavelli explained why only a Militia (armed civilians) is proper to a republic. Mercenaries could use their power to take control of the government.",1471046400,,2550,5.125
