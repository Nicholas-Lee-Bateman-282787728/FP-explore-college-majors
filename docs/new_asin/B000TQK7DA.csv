8210339,5,B000TQK7DA,"Primary reason I wanted this show.... I was living in Chicago and we got tickets to Jerry's show. Expecting the usual blonde bimbo cat fight, went along only to be stunned at the subject matter. When that horse got led out, the place erupted in embarrassing laughter. On a serious note. Parts of the show were definitely not everyone's ""cup of tea"". The guy kissing his horse... well... did gross a few folks out. Jerry was hilarious throughout the show, digging at the guests. There is however, a more serious side to this story which was lost in all the base humor... some people actually do find more love and comfort in their animals than another human. So while you may mock the guests, you should also realize that there's a story on their side which really isn't told. If you're expecting some lewd behavior, you're looking in the wrong place. This was THE show that never aired. Other things happened during the taping that you don't see. There was a special guest in the audience from the UK who was taping her own commercial for her own talk show. I chatted with her and she admitted, she would not be allowed to show any of this on British TV either. During lunch, I got the chance to chat with one of Jerry's cameramen. He too was stunned by the show having never recorded anything like this before. So it really was a stunner in every sense of the word as very few of the show's ""cast"" actually knew what the subject matter was going to be about. I bought this simply because I was there and the show never aired. Quality of the tape is excellent. I've since dubbed it to DVD.",1379289600,,1589,4.426621160409557
