5448244,2,B00AKRWXZS,It was very slow. I don't like the music or the moves. Everyone was too busy trying to look sexy to get a good workout. I have also danced Bollywood before and I saw no Bollywood moves or dance in the workout routine. I used the DVD once and have no desire to used it again.,1407628800,5,274,3.9107142857142856
5448245,3,B00AKRWXZS,"I liked the Fit and Fabulous DVD, but found that the cueing on that was a little off. Still, there isn't any choreography -- just following different exercises that you already know from... well, being alive.

This DVD also has insufficient cueing. Still, it is easy to catch up with most of the dance moves. There is a totally unnecessary 60 second break in the workout for water and stretching. The workout isn't that intense that it requires such a long break. Ten to fifteen seconds would have worked fine. After the break, comes the big finale, which is a Bollywood dance sequence. Unfortunately, most of the moves in this sequence were not introduced prior to it, so you have no idea what to do. It will take doing this workout over and over and over before you truly learn that sequence.

I ordered Doonya DVDs and I am hoping to have better results with that.",1367193600,10,867,4.551282051282051
5448246,5,B00AKRWXZS,"OK, so maybe the title is a little extravagant, but that's how I feel about this dance cardio workout.  It has some high impact but not a lot, it's mostly low impact, has good ab toning moves, as well as toning for your arms and everything else, it's fun, good cardio with a Bollywood style.  Production values are excellent.

Warmup is about 5-7 minutes then the steps get introduced one by one so you have a chance to practice them.  There is a box on the lower left the whole time except for the final dance, which is very fast, where they put it all together in a routine.  The step name box tells the name of what you are doing, then gives advance notice of the next one coming about 5 seconds previous.  I really like that.  Also, Bipasha does a voiceover the whole time except for the final routine which is fast Bollywood style.  The total workout is 30 minutes for the dance cardio.

There is an introduction to the Love Yourself workouts (there are 2 now) then the intro to this dance cardio.  Only thing I didn't like is I can't get past the opening scenes that include pictures of some kind of certificate and all the copyright warnings.  Bonus features include behind the scenes shooting.  They practiced the choreography for a month before shooting and tested the workout on ordinary women to see whether they thought it was fun, or if the steps were too hard for them to learn.  I thought that was great, to test drive something like this during the creation of it.  Why don't more people do that putting out fitness videos.

This workout is designed to be fun, no dread, and Bipasha even encourages viewers to invite their friends over to exercise with them.  I could see this video being used that way, if you had a big enough living room or family room for other people.  I sure hope Bipasha comes out with more videos, I really like her, and think that she, in conjunction with the production company Shemaroo, have very good products.

Note:  BTW, I am Caucasian, not Indian, and I think this whole video is terrific.  The video can be set for either Hindi or English and it was made in Mumbai (Bombay).  The format of the dvd I bought is NTSC which is formatted for North America.",1359072000,16,2201,4.438902743142145
8553187,5,B00AKRWXZS,I love this video and this lady! It's not super difficult cardio-wise--I think it would under-perform for someone in excellent condition but it's so incredibly fun and easy to follow after a couple times it doesn't matter!! It's the best bollywoodish video I've found.,1487462400,,268,5.113636363636363
8553188,1,B00AKRWXZS,"Saw this dance workout on YouTube and decided to purchase the DVD.  There is at least 2 1/2 minutes of introductory materials, including the normal warnings, but I was not able to advance to a menu to start the workout.  Graphics, credits all sorts of useless, time-wasting materials.  Workouts are meant to be repeated, and once you've seen the introduction you do not need to see it again.
Deal breaker.  And for some reason, I am not able to return this item.",1482278400,,462,4.597560975609756

8553191,5,B00AKRWXZS,"THIS DANCE WORKOUT IS AWESOME!!! THE CHOREOGRAPHY IS QUITE CREATIVE & IS JUST PLAIN FUN. THE DANCERS ARE ENJOYABLE TO WATCH. IT DOES GO OUT OF RHYTHM EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT SHE COMES RIGHT BACK. I'M HOPING THAT SHE MAKES MORE LIKE THIS.",1476489600,,240,4.355555555555555
8553192,5,B00AKRWXZS,"There's a lot to love about this video! If you're fairly out of shape, but you have a decent natural sense of rhythm, you'll find this workout adequately challenging and warming while also being fun to do. The music is pleasant and unique -- none of that thumping house music of most workout vids. Bipasha is fun to watch as you try to replicate her moves, and she says encouraging things at just the right times, without a hint of attitude.

My only criticism is that you don't get much warning about what's coming next, and she includes some arm movements that are unexpectedly odd and hard to follow but you can just power through them and still get good results. I'm incredibly sore the next day after doing this, in a good way!",1475107200,2,732,4.462686567164179
