4983002,5,B006BZ8NTI,"This is a wonderful DVD for those who are just starting an exercise program, or for those with mobility problems. You won't win a ""Miss Physique USA"" contest from doing these exercises, but you WILL improve your strength and overall health. The movements are gentle compared to some other DVDs out there, but don't let that fool you. The exercises are effective. If you follow along and do them as Ms. Andrews instructs, you will see and feel a definite change in your body.

I especially like that you are shown multiple ways to do the exercises, allowing you to tailor your workout to your fitness and energy level. There's even a seated version of the cardio program, which is great for people like me who have occasional knee and ankle problems. I no longer have an excuse to skip my workout because I'm having a ""bad joint day!"" The muscle toning segment works all the major muscle groups, and you don't even need to buy any equipment. Ms. Andrews shows you how to use items you probably already have around your house, such as water bottles, for resistance.

If you've tried exercise before but hated how tired and sore it made you feel, give this DVD a try.",1331769600,5,1164,4.564593301435407
4983003,5,B006BZ8NTI,"Younger in 30 Days is wonderful! It offers a great variety of exercises at a pace that works for me. I was in physical therapy last year and am so happy to find a DVD that allows me to get warmed up, stretch, and get the cardio I need in order to advance. I highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to improve their conditioning and do something good for themselves.",1331683200,4,373,4.194444444444445

This was extremely slow and boring.  I bought three more of her DVDs but haven't had a chance to view them.  This one I was very disappointed in, since they wrote her up as a Phsyical Therapy guru and I don't think she's got what it takes.  Very, very disappointed in this DVD.  I never got through it as I was aging faster then she could move.",1331596800,,537,6.0131578947368425

The DVD has one low impact 25 minute cardio workout for the heart, one relaxing 25 minute stretching workout that goes at a gentle pace, perfect for stretching, and a 25 minute strength training workout to tone up your legs and arms. The instructor, Suzanne Andrews, really knows her stuff.  She shows you how to do each exercise correctly, and you can sit or stand and go at a slower pace because when you do strength training movements slowly, you get FASTER results, because you contract your muscles longer and that tones you up faster. Also the stretching should always be done slow so you don't tear muscles and she gives you perfect examples throughout the stretching program. You won't see this type of instruction in many DVD's unless the instructor - like Suzanne Andrews, is a physical therapy pro. Here's a preview of all three workouts so you can decide for yourself if it's right for your needs.",1351641600,10,1411,6.121212121212121

8496281,5,B006BZ8NTI,"I just got this one to do along with Suzanne Andrews beginners yoga DVD I bought awhile back. These three workouts are terrific as there is one for cardio, one for toning and one for stretching.  When I'm too tired to do the most challenging exercise, I do the modified one until I catch my breath.  It really is FUNctional Fitness.

8496282,5,B006BZ8NTI,"This DVD has gone beyond fulfilling my expectations!  I purchased the program with the hopes it would help me start exercising by giving me the basic conditioning to progress to regular exercise videos.  I am over 50, disabled and haven't consistently exercised for some time.  The exercises included target your joints, heart and muscles in a gentler manner than ordinary exercise videos.  In my experience, exercise videos are designed for individuals of average to better than average fitness levels therefore excluding true beginners.

The DVD displays modified movements from your chair for those with restricted mobility as well as standing versions of the exercises.  On days when you are not up to it, you can use these modified exercises, and when you are feeling stronger and more energetic you can use the full range of motion moves.

The exercises initiate you at entry level allowing you to progress without risk of injury.  No jerky movements, no jumping and no need to feel as if you wished the DVD player had a slow motion button.  After 30 days, you will see results, not dramatic but your entire body will feel stronger and healthier.  This program will get you on the path to more challenging exercise videos because you will have the basic conditioning to withstand a more aggressive program.  This is an excellent place to start!",1332115200,13,1350,4.955555555555556
