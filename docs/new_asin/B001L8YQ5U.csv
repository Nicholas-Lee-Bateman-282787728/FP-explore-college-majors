3681916,5,B001L8YQ5U,I am a Spanish teacher and have been looking for a replacement video for a bullfighting unit that we do in class.  This video is absolutely fantastic!  It gives an excellent view into the art and shows many great quality video clips of the bullfight and behind the scenes involving what really happens at a bullfight.  The video is in Spanish with subtitles and really gives the kids a workout listening and the musical score is outstanding.  THIS IS GREAT FOR A SPANISH CLASS!,1268092800,13,477,4.642857142857143
3681917,5,B001L8YQ5U,"Here is a chance for anglos to see the greatness of the art of bullfighting. Most people can't see past the gore and they center themselves on the death of the bull. Get to know the men who do it rather than just condemning the activity. Learn first, then judge. This movie allows you to do that. And if you still want to condemn bullfighting, then stop eating meat as well, because that steak did not grow on a tree!!! :)",1265500800,2,422,4.222222222222222
3681918,4,B001L8YQ5U,"Since I was going to show this to my sixth graders, I was concerned when I received it and one of the descriptive words on the front of the DVD was 'Erotic!'  Turns out, they must have been using 'erotic' in a symbolic sort of way.  A documentary about the life of the bullfighter, David Fandila;  the movie is very tastefully done and was a perfect complement to the novel study we'd completed on the book ""Shadow of a Bull.""  Living in Spain, we are surrounded by bullfighting; now we understand it a little more.",1257638400,4,515,4.389473684210526
3681919,5,B001L8YQ5U,"What a great film ... I've been looking everywhere for a good film on Bullfights but this is amazing! ... The soundtrack is also fantastic and I want to know where you can purchase the CD which is apparently available ... Highly recommended for those who enjoy tradition ... Word to the wise though, young children should not watch this as they may be frightened by the scenes.",1257206400,3,377,4.5588235294117645
3681920,5,B001L8YQ5U,I seen a lot of bullfights in my life and this Documentary captures what a bullfight is all about.,1243036800,3,98,4.2105263157894735
3681921,5,B001L8YQ5U,"This is a fantastic voyage into the world of Bullfighting. You get to live in ""El Fandi's"" world and see him pursue his quest of completing 100 Corrida's in a single season. You see first hand the love of a family dedicated to helping David attain this dream, and the sacrifice they all make to see it happen.

Bullfighting certainly is not for everyone, but for those who can see the inherent beauty, and bravado this is sure to please. The documentarian also shows the people who protest Bullfighting, and question it's place in todays world. Bullfighting is ceratinly not without critics, but this film is about a mans total focus on attaining a dream, not a debate. To watch him in the ring is magical and majestic, he is trully one of the best Matadors. The score is also grand and the photography brillant. If this were about another topic, besides Bullfighting, this would surely have won and Academy Award.

If this topic interests you at all, buy the DVD, you will be glad you did!",1235779200,16,990,4.5875706214689265
3681942,5,B001L8YQ5U,Well done documentary on a respected bullfighter. I found it interesting throughout. Would recommend it to anyone interested in this subject.,1382486400,,141,5.761904761904762
3681943,5,B001L8YQ5U,If you want to have a movie about the life of a bullfighter this is the movie for you! Great camera work and a lot of interviews about the bullfighting with full descriptions of all the elements of this tradition. In some footages it seems to be with the matador himself!,1382227200,,271,4.333333333333333
3681944,4,B001L8YQ5U,"It's a good documentary, but a bit long for a classroom full of teenagers. Maybe skipping a few minutes in the middle, would not hurt and the students won't even know it.",1356652800,,170,4.34375
3681945,5,B001L8YQ5U,"The dvd was rated as ""acceptable"" but the item exhibited no flaws. Packaging in great shape and no problems viewing the film. As it was half the price of the next lowest price for used dvd of this title, I was very happy with my purchase.",1317081600,,238,4.195652173913044
3681946,5,B001L8YQ5U,"I have loved El Fandi from the start. His appearance in the ring is fantastic, and this movie give me the same feeling i get sitting in spain during a bullfight - almost. Worth seeing and a very very nicely made movie about our times biggest bullfighter (Exept Enrique Ponce ;-))",1291334400,,279,4.490196078431373
3681947,5,B001L8YQ5U,"This was almost unbearable, and I have seen bullfights in person, because I was unsure of the outcome.  Filmically, it was handeled in a gorgeous, tasteful, if not complete fashion.  I only have one slight problem and that was with the person who ""outlined"" the basics of bullfighting; He was simplistic, demeaning in a subtle way and unable to define the finer points that make a big difference...oh well, he must have been concerned with his PC index.",1288051200,,453,4.794871794871795
3681948,5,B001L8YQ5U,This is one of the best documentaries I watched in a long time. If you are interested in Bullfighting this is the DVD for you.,1284854400,,126,4.08
3681949,5,B001L8YQ5U,"What a wonderful matador the directors chose as the subject of their documentary. An original and skilled torero, David is humble and ""campechano"", very approachable. The photography and the colors of this film are spectacular and give a brilliant picture of what the bullfight is all about. This is no mean feat, as bullfighting is an event that does not usually come across well on film - it is something that has to be experienced live. I am also impressed with the presence of the ""anti-taurinos"", the growing number of anti-bullfighting protesters. Like El Fandi says in his understated manner, it is no different to kill a bull who has been bred for bullfighting than it is to kill a turkey who has been bred to be a Thanksgiving meal. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Spain and/or bullfighting.",1283644800,,821,4.788732394366197
3681950,5,B001L8YQ5U,"This DVD is most certainly not for everyone.  But if you want to see a corrida, if you want to see incredible talent and bravery from one of Spain's top matadors, this is a great place to start.  Through this DVD you get to see not only his talent, but also get to see a bit of the private life of El Fandi.  You don't fully appreciate this man's commitment to the corrida until you ""meet"" him outside of the ring.  His bravery and this commitment are not fully evident until you see what happens during the summer season of 2005.",1283040000,,530,4.217821782178218
3681951,5,B001L8YQ5U,"I bought this DVD to show clips of it to my students in Spanish class. I know bullfighting is not very popular outside the Spanish-speaking culture, but this documentary shows the artistic aspect of it. My students were very impressed with the amount of work and training that goes into this. They were begging for more! Definitely worth the money. :-)",1268870400,3,352,4.786885245901639
8317580,5,B001L8YQ5U,"Rare find. Enjoyed the documentary very much but, as ever, annoyed at the region restriction forcing me to buy a region free DVD player.",1492646400,,136,4.708333333333333
8317581,5,B001L8YQ5U,Gives a real insider view to bullfighting and being a matador. Very interesting.,1429747200,,80,5.230769230769231
8317582,5,B001L8YQ5U,"John Califa's score brings this noble tale to life in amazing ways; powerful, heartfelt and inspiring.",1428710400,,102,5.4375

8317584,1,B001L8YQ5U,I received the wrong movie.,1427155200,,27,4.6
8317585,5,B001L8YQ5U,"Spain without the corrida would no longer be Spain.  It would just be another anemic Belgium in which the inhabitants happened to speak Spanish.  This film is the best thing that I've personally ever seen cinematically on la corrida.  The producers of this masterpiece clearly understand and appreciate the pure emotion and artistry of the lethal ballet that is bull fighting.  They lay it all there in front of us--sand and blood; danger: color; fear; courage; nobility; family; religion and the proximity of death.  You can almost smell the dust and the bull..  El Toro, himself, is never compromised.  He is the fecund and powerful beast that has frightened and enthralled man from the Paleolithic.  The bull is life and death at the same moment.  He dies but not the death of the abattoir.  The bull, himself, dies like a taurine hero.",1426636800,3,839,4.845070422535211
8317586,5,B001L8YQ5U,Great look behind the scenes of the life of a famous Spanish matador.,1405123200,,69,4.384615384615385
8317587,5,B001L8YQ5U,"I've never had a lot of interest in bull fights, but after watching this documentary, I became more interested and understand better why it means so much to Spaniards.  Some parts are hard to watch if you have a soft stomach, but if you can get past the perceived brutality and look at it from a cultural viewpoint, there is deep meaning to the bull fight that I hadn't considered before.  I would recommend this film.",1390953600,2,418,4.4868421052631575
8317588,4,B001L8YQ5U,"The video is ok. But it shows why he is not great. He is too athletic which takes away the danger moment. Jose Thomas,Manolete and Belmonte were much more fragile and of course more artistic. He should have continued to be a ski racer.",1386547200,,235,4.363636363636363
8317589,4,B001L8YQ5U,"An excellent documentary that highlights the ups and downs of a matador's career.  The controversy that surrounds this ""ritual"" of Spain and other Latin America countries is considered by David Fandila himself, as well as a number of others.",1383523200,,241,5.17948717948718
