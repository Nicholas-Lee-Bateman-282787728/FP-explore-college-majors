8285228,4,B001BXTOU2,"Great arthouse film set in 90s outback Australia, weird and violent yet sensitive. Glad to watch it again Quality of the dvd not very good though, faded colours suggest copy of a copy.",1519689600,,184,4.606060606060606
8285229,5,B001BXTOU2,"I had to rewind several times because I was laughing so hard I couldn't hear the next several lines.  A group of people go on a long bus tour to Darwin Australia and, already fairly savage, undergo further de-evolution.  Classic, well-crafted black comedy with gags that hit you out of the blue.",1499385600,,295,4.653846153846154
8285230,5,B001BXTOU2,"This has to be one of the most original, imaginative, and unique road movies I've ever seen. Perry, an English chemist who creates different colors, has spent years attempting to recreate an elusive color he calls ""Siam Sunset."" When he suffers a personal tragedy due to a freak accident, he begins to believe that he's an accident magnet. At a bingo game, he wins a trip to the Australian Outback and soon finds himself with a motley crew of Australian passengers on a seedy coach tour of the Outback. After numerous accidents, a relationship develops between Perry and another passenger, Grace, a young woman on the run from a violent, drug-dealing ex-boyfriend, with all hell breaking loose at a dilapidated diner/motel/petrol station, where, incidentally, Perry finally rediscovers ""Siam Sunset"" along with love. Linus Roche leads an outstanding cast of Australian actors.",1432425600,,876,5.219858156028369
8285231,5,B001BXTOU2,"This has to be one of the top five Aussie films!  Humour, adventure, action, romance and scenery make it eclectic and entertaining. The characters are laconic and vibrant. Watch it - you won't be disappointed.",1295827200,,209,4.9714285714285715
