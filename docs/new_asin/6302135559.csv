438390,5,6302135559,"This is a must see movie for all Dads and sons (or daughters). FYI: Re the previous reviewer that gave it one star. The movie is not a lie. Before Pete Maravich attended Needham-Broughton high, he did indeed play at Daniel  High in Clemson, SC. He holds  the record there with 483 points in one  season. Without this uninformed one star review, the movie would get the  five stars that it so richly deserves.",943056000,34,408,4.472972972972973

438392,5,6302135559,"Pistol : the Birth of a Legend has to be one of the best movies in sports ever.  It tells the story of where Pete's dream to become the greatest basketball player ever begins.  In his freshman year of high school, Pete  Maravich had a lot of trouble.  The first knock against him was that his  dad was considered a psycho by the town because he taught Pete the weirdest  basketball drills and Pete was considered a hot dog when he put these  drills to use on the basketball court.  Another thing his teammates hated  was that a lowly freshman was playing and starting on a team that  traditionally only played seniors.  The coach's son had a real problem with  Pete because of his show-boating and at one time in the movie challenged  Pete to spin the basketball on his finger for one hour just to show him up  in front of everybody!  It ends up backfiring against him in the end as  Pete successfully completes the task and shows up the coach's son instead.  This was a also a great movie because not only did Pete overcome all this  adversity, but he also had a great deal of importance in the first  black-white high school basketball game in South Carolina.  I just saw the  tv movie ""Passing Glory"" about the first black-white game in  Lousiana high school basketball history and thought that both this movie  and ""Passing Glory"" were very well-done in the way they  interpreted the hardships of prejudice in the south at the time.  As a  matter of fact, Maravich is mentioned in the movie because at the time he  was playing college basketball at LSU, although it was a derogatory  statement about how people saw Pete play the game at the time.  This movie  was also made just before Pete's untimely death and there is a tribute to  his life at the end of the movie.  If you like basketball, Pete Maravich,  or just want to see a really good movie which you can watch over and over  again, then I would recommend purchasing the ""Pistol: Birth of a  Legend.""",919900800,14,1963,4.4491525423728815
438423,5,6302135559,"Thank you for this good deal. I wanted to view this old movie, now it's done. I hope it will be in french soon.",1345161600,,111,3.6666666666666665
438424,5,6302135559,"This is a great movie.  Great story and the interviews are very inspirational.  Im not a big basketball fan, but this is great for everyone in the family.  It also came very quickly.  Pleased with the overall experience.",1340582400,,220,4.7105263157894735
438425,1,6302135559,"Over the years, I've watched numerous sports movies, both fictional and biographical.  Without a doubt, this one ranks near the very bottom.  There is so little to the story; the main plot seems to be that the coach's son has a severe jealously problem with Maravich.  That's it, really.  The acting is weak, the basketball scenes are worse.  They are repetitive, and take place at half speed.  Pete Maravich was a terrific ballplayer; if you want to learn more about him, you won't be able to do so here.",1334620800,,505,4.617977528089888
438426,2,6302135559,"Ok, first off let me say that I have all the respect in the world for Pistol Pete Maravich....but this movie does him no justice in my opinion! NONE!!! My co-workers were telling me that ""You have to see this movie""...so I was like okay, and I just watched it yesterday and that is 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life I wish I could have back. The first 45 minutes of the movie is decent...the rest is NOT very good and here is why....

#1- MOST OF THE ACTING IS VERY POOR - I don't care if it is an older movie and came out in the 90's there is no excuse for poor acting like there is in this movie, not all the acting is bad though. I have seen a lot of basketball movies in this by far has the worst actors. I guess the makers of this film never saw HOOSIERS.

#2- THE FILM IS VERY STAND STILL - What I mean by this is the movie has Pete at one age the entire time!!! What? and why? There are no scenes of his time at LSU or his basketball days in PA or the NBA. Just keeps him as an 8th grader the entire time. If anyone knows anything about PP he was the greatest NCAA scorer in history, why not show that?

#3- REPETITIVE SCENES - You see these most in the basketball games scenes, which are pretty slow and funny if you ask me. If you watch closely you can tell that just filled in spots during the games with plays and scenes they had already shot...and they do this a bunch! Its just very CHEESY if you know what I mean EXAMPLE = At the end they play Cleveland High (an all black team) they are down like 71-63, and within like 2 seconds, its a 70-71 game....what the hell? Really? just CHEESY to me!

There are some good things about this movie though, like I said the first 45 minutes are pretty good, and inspirational...and that story is about 90% accurate, which is good. This is a good ""feel good"" or aka ""Joel Olsteen type"" of movie for 10 year old kids, not adults. It shows that hard work does pay off and to listen to your parents....and an overall decent family movie I guess, not a lot of profanity or swear words. It is just hard for me (being the sports fan I am) to give this movie any more than 2 stars! I just can't do it folks!

It is just the movie is just missing so much in my opinion! It focuses on an important part of Petes life, but stays there the entire movie....BORING! Its like making a movie about Michael Jordan and not showing his time with the Bulls! There needs to be another movie done about The Pistol, cause this one just lacks so much for us true sports fans and adults! I cant put this film as a must see at all! MUST SEE BASKETBALL MOVIES ARE: Hoop Dreams, Blue Chips, and Hoosiers....not this! SORRY, this movie lacks and I wouldn't pay anymore than $5 for it if you are smart. OVERALL 2.5 STARS!!!!! ""Enjoy""

438427,5,6302135559,I bought this DVD to show the girls that I coach what being a winner is. In order to be a winner you need to have a winning attitude and good work ethic. This movie couldn't do a better job depicting this. Also what I love about this movie is that the drills you see him do will make you a better basketball player.

438428,4,6302135559,I LOVED WATCHING PETE MARAVICH AS A KID BUT I WISH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN IN THE MOVIE AND SOME OF HIS FILM HIGHLIGHTS FROM COLLEGE AND THE NBA. THE MOVIE I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD BUT HIS COMMENTARY WAS VERY QUIET SO KINDA HARD TO HEAR. OVERALL I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WELL WORTH IT.,1263686400,,281,4.035714285714286
438429,5,6302135559,"I LOVE this video. Most of my grandchildren play basketball and they've watched this video quite a few times. When my 12 yr old granddaughter had friends over for a sleep over, this was the movie they watched.  Even though it is an old video, it is still enjoyable to watch the young man who portrayed Pete Maravitch.",1240790400,,317,4.4655172413793105
438430,4,6302135559,"This is about as clean a movie as you could find: a nice story about the famous basketball player ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich in his earlier days. An incredible talent, Maravich went on to star at LSU and then in the professional NBA.

This particular story centers around young Maravich as an eighth-grader playing basketball for his high school team. The first half of the film was fascinating as actor Adam Guier was very credible exhibiting Maravich's tremendous ball-handling skills for a kid his age. There also is some nice photography in here.

The second half of the movie became a little too Hollywood-clich ridden. I wish they had gone into Pete's college and pro career and ended with his conversion to Christianity before his untimely death. It could have been a very powerful movie instead of just a nice after-school-type TV film, although that serves a good purpose.

I understand that there has been a DVD released a few years ago which deals with his later life and conversion. My only look at this film was on tape about a dozen years ago.",1239321600,,1053,4.743169398907104

""The Pistol"" opens the door to doing just what is needed. I was trying to explain to my son why I love to play basketball and why its not always important to 'follow'. You must lead yourself through life- Pete Maravich was a kid growing up in South Carolina during changes times in this country. He stepped past the mundane dribble dribble pass pass pass dribble shoot.

438465,5,6302135559,"If you are a fan of basketball, you must know who ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich is and about his contribution to the game.

Now you can get a glimpse into the childhood story of how Maravich grew into one of the top 50 players in NBA history in this wonderful family movie.

The movie has plenty of basketball action and the young man playing the ""Pistol"", Adam Guier, shows off some amazing skills.  This is a super film to watch if you are coaching young children.  The story offers hope and inspiration, as well as some woonderful drills for your players to try.

This movie, rated G, is part of a dying breed-Great FAMILY entertainment for the ENTIRE family.",1178928000,,655,4.516949152542373
438466,3,6302135559,"I saw this movie when it FIRST came out on VHS and thought I liked it. I was impressed with the skills of the young Pistol, like when he was walking on the rail of the railroad tracks, dribbling the ball on the railroad ties.

In this viewing, I didn't have the same impression. The basketball footage is comical in how easy everything is portrayed. People don't play defense, Pistol gets wide open layups, etc. I could have beaten the teams they played, and I don't even play basketball.

Then there are the racist undertones, while Pistol isn't portrayed as the racist, his teammates/coach/community are, there is no condemnation of it either.  It makes for a very uncomfortable viewing in 2007.

This movie is mildly entertaining, but the voice over narration is creepy and the story line takes far too long to get going.",1178755200,3,824,4.701388888888889
438467,5,6302135559,"This is a story about the great Pete Maravich and his eigth grade basketball season playing on the varsity high school team. I say a story because it probably is not a true biography. For instance, Pete's brother Ronnie played on the team and that is not mentioned in the movie. Ronnie had a hot and cold relationship with the family and was probably purposely left out of the movie. Also, I believe the relationship as portrayed between Pete's mother and father in the movie is probably a little too cozy as opposed to what reality was. Having said that, as a sports movie it is very uplifting. The actor that plays Pete does a great job of trying to showcase the skills that Pete was developing at the time that would eventually lead to him having a great basketball career. At different points in the movie we see Pete practice the dribbling and passing drills that helped him acquire the skills that were far superior to other players at the time. He would then put those skills to play during the games, and the actor in the movie must have practiced a lot because he does a good job in the game sequences. We also get a sense from the movie about the relationship Pete has with his dad. His dad basically raised him to become a professional basketball player. The movie depicts Press Maravich, Pete's dad, as hard driving, but somewhat tender.  The performances of the other actors are very good as well. Particularly that of the coach of the high school team. He really does a great job of portraying the attitude of baskeball coaches back at this time which was: slow the game down and pass into the tall guy. Pete was devloping a game that would be based on the fast break which would include slick ball handling and passes meant to trick the opposition and also delight the crowd. Some of the lines the coach has during time outs of games are pretty funny. I read somewhere that they actually tried to get Ronald Reagan to play the part of the coach after he was President: This movie was made in the early 1990's. Made on a shoe string budget, this film shows that you don't need to have a ton of money to make a good movie.",1173312000,,2135,4.418781725888325

He had just begun playing basketball and his Dad wanted him to watch this movie to motivate him and show him what was possible with hard work and determination. Unfortunately, my fiance died the day after the movie arrived and he never had the chance to watch it with him. We watched the movie together about a month after his funeral and not only did it have the desired effect his Dad originally had hoped for, it is now a special, family movie that will live in the heart of this little boy for the rest of  his life.

I recommend it for all fathers and sons as well as moms and step moms to watch with their would be future stars.

438474,4,6302135559,"It has been more than 15 years since I watched this film for the 1st time as a young kid in grade school who loved basketball.  It was inspirational then and watching it today as an adult and knowing that the Pistol later on committed his life to Christ, it has even become more meaningful.  Technically or from a filmmaking standpoint, its as good as most films with that budget and from that time period.  Its the good storytelling that delivers... much like the film Hoosiers with Gene Hackman was.  The basketball sequences aren't as ""technically-exciting"" as sports movies of today are but, they still delivered excitement and cthey contributed to the development of the story.  Of the Special Features, the testimony by Pistol Pete himself was great but rather lengthy and subtitles would have helped.  However, I was hoping that there were more features about Pistol Pete and his achievements.  I think they have that in a different edition though.",1168300800,,955,4.894409937888199
438475,5,6302135559,"""The Pistol"" refers to Peter Marovich.  This is not a documentary or biography of him, though, but looking at his youth, at the turning point of what made him the player he was later.

Marovich later became a Christian (or at least re-committed his life), and the film was backed by Chik-Fil-A, whose founder was a Christian.  This, though, is not a Christian film per se.  There is no mention of God or Jesus or anything religious.  There are no church scenes.

This movie is excellent for all members of the family.  I wonder why more filmmakers don't make pictures like this.  The movie critic of the Nashville Tennessean (who considered PG-13 ""The Addams Family"" a better family picture than the G-rated ""Beauty And The Beast"") could not find anything negative to say about it, but still gave a less than excited review of it.  This movie is for those who feel a movie can be enjoyable even if it lacks sex, violence, and profanity.",1162684800,3,936,4.624242424242424
438476,4,6302135559,"I had heard that the movie had some good drills that my daughter might benefit from.  The dribbling work the actor does is amazing, but most of these things can be done with practice.  My daughter is now proficient at the drills we chose to work on.  She made the Varsity as a freshman a few days ago.  The story is a good one.  It goes into some of the hardships he faced as a kid, but not some of the tougher things he faced as an adult.  It is definitely a family movie.",1162512000,,473,3.978723404255319

Pistol Pete sticks to the life of 8th grader Pete Maravich.  His dad is a coach at the local college and teaches him basketball in his spare time.  Pete doesn't fit in very well at school because he is so hooked on basketball.  He gets a chance to try out for the team and hijinx ensue.  It is actually pretty good basketball to watch - even though it was made a while ago and on a shoestring budget.  I wish I could have seen Pete Maravich play when he was alive.

438512,5,6302135559,"This wonderful basketball movie is a childhood biography of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame enshrinee Peter Press ""Pistol Pete"" Maravich. He was one of the few people in basketball history bred by his father Press Maravich to become a basketball child prodigy.
  Out of all the basketball movies ever released I would rate very few as truly exceptional. This is one of the best basketball movies ever made. It portrays the loving obsession of Pete's desire to become a basketball scoring superman and showman supreme. Maravich later lived up to his self-fulfilling prophecy of what NBA basketball hall-of- famer Isiah Thomas stated: "" 'Pistol Pete' Maravich was probably the greatest NBA showman of all time "". Maravich, probably more than any other NBA player is responsible for the basketball ""showtime"" obsession we are permeated with today. He was the forerunner of assimilating more ""Harlem Globetrotter"" trick skills to seriously competitive NBA games than any individual before him.
  ""The Pistol: The Birth of a Legend"" shows Pete in his self-training with amazing basketball handling and trick shooting skills. Former UCLA coach John Wooden stated that ""Pistol Pete"" Maravich could perform more amazing things with a basketball when he was in the tenth grade than any Harlem Globetrotter John Wooden ever saw.
  This movie depicts Maravich's schoolboy career. Although in the past some plans had been made to create a movie about the entire life of Pete Maravich such a movie has never come to fruition. This is the only movie about Maravich in existence. Adam Guier as Pete Maravich and Nick Benedict as his father perform fine acting portrayals. Admittedly, Pete was spindly and somewhat ill health in appearance ( whereas Adam Guier is not ) and the real Press Maravich as his father was in fact probably tougher acting than Nick Benedict, this is still a very creditable acting performance. This movie doesn't explore the tragic personal problems Pete's mother had.
  This inspirational movie has a Christian tone to it and it was the recipient of a Christian award to films. Although Pete Maravich early in his life wasn't clean cut in his life-style he spent a great deal of time spreading the Christian message in his later years before he so tragically died on a basketball court at a church school in California at the age of forty. This movie was released close to the time of his death so it is more in keeping with his moralistic intentions at that time. Perhaps because this movie wasn't released by Hollywood is the very reason why it is such a superb movie.
  I perform one person basketball trick shooting shows and I must confess to you that Pete Maravich influenced me more than any one else other than the Harlem Globetrotters. Thanks to idolizing Pete when I was a teenager I am able to perform some of those extraordinarily difficult trick shots you see Adam Guier perform in this movie to a phenomenally high degree of statistical accuracy.
  If you should only view five basketball movies in your lifetime this movie should be one of them.",1033776000,32,3076,4.928433268858801
438513,4,6302135559,"Pete Maravich is an 8th grader who loves basketball and thinks he is better than any player on the varsity team. One day Pete asked the teacher to go to the bathroom. Instead Pete skipped class to shoot some hoops and he got caught by the varsity coach. The coach asked Pete if he wanted to play basketball and Pete said ""Yes sir."" Then the coach told him to get ready and practice with the team. Pete started playing with the varsity team,which are 12th graders.
  Pete started dressing out for the varsity team and sat on the bench for the first 5 out of 6 games. Pete had a crush on buddy's girlfriend. Buddy is the son of the varsity team's coach.
Buddy tells Pete to quit the team or else.
  Pete's dad said that if you have gun slinging hands you can do anything so Pete started practicing.
  I would recomend this movie to everyone.",1019520000,2,839,4.312101910828026
