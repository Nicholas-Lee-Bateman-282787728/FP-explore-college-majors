7864135,5,6304162235,"I love these Flintstone Christmas specials and this is one of the best collections ever! With the first special, ""A Flintstone's Family Christmas"", I knew Pebbles and Bam-Bam had gotten married, but now they have adorable twins, approiately enough, a platinum blonde baby girl and a red-haired baby boy. That makes Wilma and Fred grandparents, wow! The entire story centers around Fred and co. being excited about the kids and grandkids coming home for Christmas, but beofore they arrive the holiday fun is interrupted by a ""caveless"" boy who ends up intertwining himself in the lives of the Flintstones. Is there going to be another addition to the Flintstone family?

Following this special is the classic original Flintstones special from the 60's series, ""How the Flintstones Saved Christmas"". Take a trip back in time x 2! It's Christmas again but Pebbles and Bam-Bam are only babies. Fred becomes a department store Santa and is so good at it he attracts the attention of the real Santa who needs a little help.

There's even more included on this tape! A couple cartoon shorts, Dino II AKA ""The Great Egg-Scape"", and Breezly & Sneezly: ""Noodnick of the North"".

Excellent family fun for kids of all ages!!!",1243382400,2,1213,4.936274509803922

7864137,5,6304162235,This is a fun romp with Fred and Barney. Love to watch it every year. By the way your editors description is wrong. Santa is not stranded at the North Pole with a sprained ankle. He is stranded at Fred's house!!!,1133654400,2,212,4.195121951219512
7864138,4,6304162235,"Despite the objections of the rather odd reviewers who slandered this tape, I encourage anyone who likes the Flintstones and loves Christmas to get it. It's adorable, fun, very Christmas-y, and I watch it every year. A family classic. Basically you will know if you like it beforehand; there is nothing particularly offensive about these episodes, so as I said, if you liked both this television show and cute holiday specials, this is a good buy.

As for the accusation of every person who likes this being a communist....I don't think that even merits a response. Perhaps it was a joke.",1101081600,11,588,4.821782178217822
