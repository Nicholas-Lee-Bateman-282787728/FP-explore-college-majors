8017417,3,B0001WTWP6,"I felt compelled to add another review, since there's only one on Amazon now , and I strongly disagree with it. I very much enjoyed the Touching Evil series. Robson Green is a wonderful actor. He is younger here than on his most recent PBS series ""Grantchester"" , but every role I have ever seen him from young to older he has been terrific! This is a darker mystery show than some as the title lets you know- I am surprised the other reviewer was expecting a light & humorous show called, "" Touching Evil"" ? This particular episode is probably the weakest, but it's still better than 99% of most things on tv. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dark, mystery, detective type shows.",1455321600,,691,4.448818897637795
8017418,2,B0001WTWP6,"This was my first exposure to Touching Evil, and I'm delighted to be warned.  This is an ""edgy"" detective story, meaning violent, ugly, obscene, soap opera like, and without a trace of humor or wit.  I'll take Jack Frost, thanks.  Buyer beware.",1154476800,3,244,4.761904761904762
