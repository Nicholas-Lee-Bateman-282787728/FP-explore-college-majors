An astonishing number of visual moments from that film are borrowed or parodied directly, not to mention the ""look and feel"".  I was once you start looking, the debt becomes glaring.",980380800,2,340,4.65
995794,5,6305257450,"I write specifically about this Criterion DVD version of the film. The other cuts simply do not do the film justice. Some of the films most beautiful and most powerful shots are cut in half, and some of them are  removed entirely in the 185 minute cut that is available on video. Although  other cuts were endorsed, this is 204 minute version is how the film was  originally meant to be seen, and I feel that it makes a big difference. The  photography and pacing of this film is breathtaking. It is an epic in every  sense of the word, but not at all in the sense of the traditional Hollywood  notion of 'epic'. This is a fragmented, episodic story, where some of the  episodes don't deal with the protagonist of the film at all. In some of  them he is merely an observer, in others he is left out entirely. These  scenes serve on a metaphorical level, not a physical one. Ultimately  though, it all culminates to express the same basic thing: the need for the  artist to trascend the earth, the natural world in order to reach something  beyond to material, beyond the physical. And it is often about the artist's  failure to do this.
I recommend alongside this, Jacques Rivette's film  'La Belle Noiseuse'. They are very different films, but they both deal with  the same essential themes. And both are extremely important works of  cinematic art.",954633600,14,1350,4.5625
995795,4,6305257450,"in maya tourovskaya's book on tarkovsky, the animal cruelty issue was raised in an interview with tamara ogorodnikova, who produced 'andrei rublev':
""my god, mayechka, it is only a movie!""
she  explicitly stated that no animals were harmed in the filming process, and  that the burning cow sequence was achieved through special effects and  asbestos. the cow scene never made the 183-minute cut because tarkovsky  felt it looked unrealistic.
acceptance of  this disclaimer is your  prerogative, but disclaimers are all most of us ever really have.  o, and  the film?
it doesn't sound great and the stock doesn't seem to have aged  well, but tarkovsky's intensely poetic vision and vyacheslav ovchinnikov's  unforgettable score cannot be denied. like literary counterparts dostoevsky  and tolstoy, tarkovsky has a sweeping, epic vision that can seem daunting  at times (203 minutes is pretty long). while some may find it interminably  and excruciatingly slow, i like to think that tarkovsky has enough respect  for the audience to take his time and allow the viewer to settle into the  experience. it's not just a great visual and audio document or merely a  powerful story - 'andrei rublev' is a gestalt experience, requiring and  rewarding total immersion on your part. watch it alone or with someone  who's comfortable enough with you to shut up for a few hours. you'll be  glad you did.",951955200,7,1390,5.097777777777778
995796,5,6305257450,"The first time I saw Andrei Rublev I fell asleep after the first fifteen minutes. The second time I saw it I stayed wide awake for the entire viewing. I was impressed by its visual grandeur and its message so much  that it is one of the five best films that I have ever seen. It is one of  the first films to convince me that that excellent films can be extremely  challenging to watch. Despite some of the most disturbing scenes I have  ever scene, I no longer view film as a diversion but as an exploration. It  is atmospheric, heavenly, gothic, spooky, dreamy, frightening, and  thought-provoking. The definitive 205-minute version released by Criterion  does an excellent job in restoring some very important scenes which add to  the flow of the film and make it easier to understand.

995797,5,6305257450,"In this movie Tarkovski paints several small paintings, like Rublev paints icons. They all are linked together yet have no direct link. They depict life in Russia and the works of men and God through Orthodox Church. Tarkovski is Rublev. The movie as surely inspired some main directors, such  as Emir Kusturica, as the night bathing nude scene of the pagans is very  close to the dreamy wedding scene in Time of Gypsies. The movie is slow and  sometimes difficult to reach the links (as for the long 30 minutes scene of  the manufacturing of the huge Bell) but is Hypnotic and soulful. Rublev is  a humble and pathetic character as he refuses the world, but doesn't  attempt to change it.

995798,5,6305257450,I was very disappointed to discover that this DVD contains black-and white copy of the movie. I have seen this movie back in Russia in color and can tell that color is very important for this movie as a language.

995917,5,6305257450,"Rublev is extraordinary in many ways, for its overall vision, the skill with which its epic scenes are orchestrated, the proliferation of imagery and visual themes, its detailed and realistic evocation of life in the middle ages as well as its profound depiction of the stages of development in an artists life.

There is an action filled battle scene, lots of conflict and beautiful dreamlike moments in the film.  There are also a number of philosophical arguments  about time, integrity, art , the importance of faithin each other and ourselvesand the artists place in the world. These discussions reflect the contemplative nature of Rublev and his teachers (not to mention Tarkovsky himself).  These need a bit of patience, as most filmgoers have never experienced these type of scenes in contemporary films.

Tarkovsky, when asked, denied he was interested in any kind of symbolism in his films.  He thought symbols delivered messages, and he felt the films he made spoke directly to his audience without the help of symbols. However, in contrast to what he says, it is impossible not to interpret many of the images he uses as symbols.  He just didn't want to have to answer any questions about them, and preferred to call them imagery.

Andrei Rublev has a rather unusual form.  Its episodes are divided into sectionseach with a title.  This gives the film a more formal feel, and can help you organize your memories of the film.  This episodic format is similar to that of La Dolce Vita, a film Tarkovsky admired. The imagery and ideas are dense and it can be disorienting for viewers unaccustomed to reading imagery, or visual motifs.

It might be a help to review these sections before you see the film.

1. PROLOGUE: FLYING serves as an overture to the work, a visual portrait of an artistic experienceits passion and its danger.  A group of men prepare a hot-air balloon to flythey defy superstition, and are obviously visionaries. The townsfolk view the balloon as witchcraft and a struggle ensues. As the balloon ascends, it captures the overview, expanse and breath of great art but also illustrates the sacrifice that might be required for it.  The world of earth, air, fire and water is breathtakingly evoked. It ends with the enigmatic image of a horse.

2. THE JESTER  Summer 1400: We meet a traveling mimethe portrait of the artist as entertainer (and a heretic because he is pagan). Through him we and are introduced to the medieval world: the world of peasants, the monastery, Christianity vs. paganism.

3. THEOPHANES the GREEK  1405-1406: Rublev bids goodbye to his mentor and strikes out on his own.  He chooses his assistants (this is what all artists must do to develop their own style).

4. THE PAGEANT: a vision of Christ. Rublev observes scenes that will inspire his paintinga village pageant of the crucifixion.

5. THE HOLIDAY  1408  MIDSUMMERS NIGHT -  St. JOHNS EVE: The artists introduction to the sensual world.  Midsummers night was pagan ritual where the young joyfully gave up their virginity.  They are hunted down by Christian soldiers of the church in the morning after.

6. THE LAST JUDGMENT  1408: Rublevs first big jobhe revolts against authority and learns about treachery and betrayal.

7. THE RAID  1408: The horror of the world descends upon Rublev.  A jealous prince attacks his own brothers town and destroys it. Rublev, in defense, kills a man.

8. THE CHARITY  Winter 1412: He vows silence and renounces art. A half-wit girl he saved is taken off by the Tartars.  He meets a fellow artist, but has lost faith in himself.

9. THE BELL  1423-1424: After a long period of wandering, Rublev observes a budding artist come into his own through enormous faith in himself, courage, chance-taking, hard work and a great deal of luck. (many of the virtues needed for ambitious artistic undertakings) The young man takes on the job of creating a bell for a cathedral.  Through this remarkable sequence, one of the most beautiful in film, Rublev regains his faith in himself, and begins to produce his finest work.

10. CODA  The black and white film now fades into color, and we finally see Rublevs actual work.  All the scenes in the film are represented here, and it becomes apparent that Tarkovsky has created his film from the images Rublev painted.

This film is a cornerstone of the finest achievements in film.",1420675200,7,4360,4.868206521739131
995918,5,6305257450,"With Andrei Roublev Andrei Tarkovsky and fellow screenwriter Andrei Konchalovsky couldn't have picked a more ambitious subject. Though little known in the West, the 15th century Russian iconographer is considered in Russia as emblematic not only of artistic creativity at the highest level, but of the very creation of Russia itself as a united country. The story of the production of this film is a fascinating but complex one. I recommend reading Johnson and Petrie's outstanding survey The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue to get a full account of it. The authorities originally okayed a script which consisted of 2 parts with 12 episodes and 2 prologues. Lack of money and other production problems led to the film being reduced to 2 parts, 8 episodes, a prologue and an epilogue. The cuts made shifted the tone away from a Socialist Realist perspective (gone is the planned opening depiction of the Kulikovo Field battle which would have shown a 'Russian' leader in a positive heroic light) towards an inner deeply religious meditation on the nature of art and the permanent link between religion and culture. Communism and Christianity are of course anathema to each other and the post-Krushchev administration attempted to suppress the film completely when they realized its full nature. It was only due to foreign pressure (particularly from the Cannes Film Festival which awarded the film the International Critics Prize in 1969) that the film was released inside Russia and people could at last see what all the fuss was about.

The struggle to get Andrei Roublev released led many western critics to interpret Tarkovsky's extraordinary depiction of an artist struggling to find a voice in Medieval times as an allegory on the director's own struggles with the Communist regime. Though this reading may be supported, it is a posthumous view coming from outside Russia and from commentators all too quick to slip the knife into a despised political system. For a more accurate appraisal of what lies behind Andrei Roublev we should turn to what Tarkovsky says about the film in his wonderful book Sculpting in Time. There we find two themes that run concurrently. The first is the film as an investigation into the nature of poetic genius, into the very act of artistic creation which of course remains universal down through the ages. Tarkovsky says: 'I wanted to investigate the nature of the poetic genius of the great Russian painter. I wanted to use the example of Roublev to explore the question of the psychology of artistic creativity, and analyze the mentality and civic awareness of an artist who created spiritual treasures of timeless significance'. Of course this means an exploration of the nature of Tarkovsky's own 'artistic creativity' and 'civic awareness' and to that extent Roublev is a surrogate figure for the film maker himself as well as for all other artists of substance and integrity. The struggles Roublev goes through, the events he witnesses and the debates he has with those around him can be said to have a very broad range of significance for all such artists. As I will try to show later the series of tableaux that make up the film's unusual structure provide key situations or events which engage repeatedly with 'the psychology of artistic creativity' and amount to a profound statement from Tarkovsky's inner creative heart and soul.

The second theme of the film constitutes a metaphysical statement on the birth of modern Russia. Tarkovsky comments: 'Trained in the monastery of the Trinity and St. Sergius under Sergey Radomezhsky, Andrei, untouched by life has assimilated the basic axiom: love, community, brotherhood. At that time of civil strife and fratricidal fighting, and with the country trampled underfoot by the Tartars, Sergey's motto, inspired by reality, and by his own political percipience, summarized the need for unity, for centralization, in the face of the Mongol-Tartar yoke, as the only way to ensure survival and achieve national and religious dignity and independence'. Put more simply 'the film was to show how the national yearning for brotherhood, at a time of vicious internecine fighting and the Tartar yoke, gave birth to Roublev's inspired 'Trinity' - epitomizing the ideal of brotherhood, love and quiet sanctity. Such was the philosophical basis of the screenplay'. Andrei Roublev was Russia's greatest artist and the 'Trinity' was his greatest work. Tarkovsky's film shows how Roublev came to paint this masterpiece.

Beyond these two main themes we must appreciate that Roublev and his fellow artists were monks living and working mainly in monasteries and cathedrals and that for Russians an 'icon' isn't merely a religious painting, but the very presence of God himself. In this way the film posits the idea that religion and culture are inseparable. Mark Le Fanu in his study The Cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky acutely observes: 'The wise Pushkin spoke...of 'reigning religion' as 'the unfailing source of poetry in all peoples'. At its deepest level Tarkovsky agrees with that. Culture and religion belong to each other, indeed are each other. It is the single most daring proposition in Andrei Roublev'.

It says a lot for the film's hypnotic power - Vadim Yusov's superb Breughel-inflected scope b/w photography, Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov's subtle well deployed music, the committed acting of the principals (especially Anatoly Solonitsyn as Roublev), and Tarkovsky's spectacularly innovative sense of mise-en-scne - that many people are happy to admire without needing an explanation of what they are seeing. You can bathe in the film's gorgeous potion of exotic Eastern mysticism and come out saying, ""I've had a religious experience"". One reason the film can work on this superficial level is that not much is known about Andrei Roublev's real life and surroundings. Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky were consequently left free to approach the 'spirit' of the circumstances that led up to the creation of the 'Trinity' rather than having to expound a complicated plot with facts written in stone which everyone would be expecting to see translated to the screen. Not having to relate specifics of Roublev's life Tarkovsky relegates the character of Roublev to the role of a Christ-like spectator who observes 8 key situations which obliquely chart his journey from the Trinity monastery where he first learns about life as a theory, through real life where his ideals are tested, lost and finally re-found with renewed vigor. Tarkovsky: 'As Hermann Hesse says in The Glass Bead Game, 'truth has to be lived, not taught. Prepare for battle!'...Underlying the concept of Andrei Roublev's character is the schema of a return to the beginning; I hope this emerges in the film as the natural and organic progression of the 'free' flow of life created on the screen. For us the story of Roublev is really the story of a 'taught', or imposed concept, which burns up in the atmosphere of a living reality to arise again from the ashes as a fresh and newly-discovered truth'. Looked at objectively this is the journey any true artist has to undertake. He learns his trade at school, but real art can only be created out of real life experiences - ' Traditional truths remain truths only when they are vindicated by personal experience...My years as a student, when I was preparing to enter the profession in which evidently I am destined to remain for the rest of my days, seem pretty strange'. Tarkovsky succeeds in depicting this journey of artistic discovery, but by keeping Roublev largely a spectator to events as they happen, he also carries out the second theme of charting the birth of modern Russia as well. Let's take a closer look:

PROLOGUE: Tarkovsky starts his long epic with a simple declaration of the main theme - man's need for artistic creation as expressed through a desire to fly. A peasant man rows across a river to a church where a large very primitive hot air balloon is waiting for him to ride up into the sky. He climbs the bell tower and jumps out of the window onto ropes dangling from the balloon. The balloon sets off and the man is indeed flying. The journey takes him over the countryside until eventually the balloon starts to deflate and the man is brought to earth with a bump. There are several things we should note here. First is the theme of flight or levitation, a Tarkovsky motif which pervades all his films. Remember Ivan's Childhood also began with a character levitating over nature. Then there are the 4 natural elements which are ever-present - water (the river), fire (the furnace producing the gas to fill the balloon with 'hot' air), air (the wind that carries the balloon) and earth (the start and finish of the man's journey). Here Tarkovsky makes the connection between artistic creativity and nature - one cannot exist without the other. Note also the horse standing at the base of the bell tower and another horse rolling on its back directly after the man's return to earth. I think it's clear the horse is connected with nature and is the mirror in which man's behavior (both good and bad) is reflected throughout the film. The most famous horse scene happens in Episode 6: The Raid where a horse falls from a rampart and is speared to death. We feel the evil of the conflict that surrounds it, just as we feel the joy of a man's flight at the end of this prologue. Note also the film's epilogue closes on the image of horses standing in a meadow. Coming after a stunning montage of Roublev's icons in spectacular color this return to the b/w world of horses again suggests that artistic creativity and nature are totally reliant on each other. Another point we should mention is that this sequence is inspired by the Icarus legend which is synonymous with man's over-ambition. The original script had the man jump with wings - the idea of the balloon came later. Over-ambition is perhaps a key note for Tarkovsky/Konchalovsky's outrageous aims embodied by this film. But then, art which is not overly ambitious is not art at all...

EPISODE 1: THE BUFFOON (1400): Three monks walk across the countryside. They are later identified as Kirill (Ivan Lapikov), Daniil the Black (Nikolai Grinko) and Andrei Roublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn). They have just left Trinity monastery and are taking their first steps into the real world as artists for hire. A rainstorm forces them to take shelter in a barn where a buffoon is entertaining his fellow peasants with outrageous singing and dancing. Apparently much of the significance of what passes here has eluded the translator in the English subtitles, but we understand enough to know the buffoon ridicules the monks. The affonted Kirill leaves the place in silence. Later officers employed by the landowner come to arrest the buffoon. We will hear in Episode 8: The Bell that Kirill has informed on the man who is sent to prison. We learn several things here - that insulting a monk is a blasphemous crime, that monks are disconnected from the people they are supposed to serve, that Christian belief and what most people believe in (most likely paganism) demarcates a yawning social divide, that Kirill represents religion practiced in its most un-Christian and draconian fashion, that monks must assume greater humility and learn how to take a joke, and finally that Roublev merely sits and watches injustice meted out by his 'brother'. He may not know it yet, but the chasm between the people and the Church and man's injustice to man depicted in this episode will be exactly what he will later try to counter with his final creation of the 'Trinity'.

EPISODE 2: THEOPHANES THE GREEK (1405): In the next three episodes Tarkovsky focuses on the nature of artistic creativity by differentiating between the three monks we have already been introduced to as well as introducing a fourth notion of artistic creation through the character of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev). Despite the title, this episode focuses on Kirill who represents the untalented artist who is too jealous, materialistic and egotistical ever to make the grade in his vocation. He enters a church to look for Theophanes. Theophanes was in real life the greatest icon painter in Russia before Roublev and is said to have been his teacher. A Byzantine artist born in Constantinople he had peregrinated up into Russia and at the time he meets Kirill here he is looking for another artist to help paint the Annunciation Church in Moscow. He asks Kirill about Andrei Roublev, but Kirill puts down his colleague and ingeniously offers his own services instead with the condition that Theophanes must come to the Andronnikov Monastery himself and ask for Kirill in front of his colleagues. The second part of this episode takes place at the monastery. Retainers of the Grand Duke come to demand Roublev (not Kirill) come to Moscow with Theophanes. Roublev accepts to the dismay of his two colleagues. Daniil professes to a flash of jealousy but listens to Roublev's confession and tearfully wishes him well. Kirill on the other hand feels himself insulted and storms away. His jealousy, egotism and materialism found out, he damns himself for being talentless. Stressing again that artistic creativity is a natural and `good' thing which shouldn't be sullied by evil, Tarkovsky has Kirill club his dog to death in a scene of great brutality. This contrasts with the deep humility shown by Roublev in the previous scenes where he accepts his job with extreme diplomacy and shows great sympathy for Daniil. Clearly for Tarkovsky a great artist must show love, humility and charity even if ambition can't be ignored.

EPISODE 3: THE PASSION ACCORDING TO ANDREI (1406): Roublev's Christ-like humility, self-effacement and possession of genuine love for others lie at the heart of this episode. Roublev and his helper Foma are walking through the woods where they happen across Theophanes sitting on a tree trunk his legs covered in ants. It is unclear if Theophanes is alive or if this is his ghost (as Le Fanu suggests), but the two enter into a conversation about the nature of artistic creativity which is very important - possibly the very crux of the meaning of the whole film. Clearly Theophanes is a genuine artist who has had a long career and has influenced a great many others, Roublev included. However, the conversation here reveals his conviction that art is not designed to make the world a better place for people to live in. For him art cannot ennoble man at all. Rather, it is the job of art to reflect the evil world and remind people of their inescapable destiny as incorrigible sinners. His idea of painting Christ's Passion is not to picture a man dying for the sins of all of us so that we may all live again and essay good God-fearing lives. Rather his Passion is an illustration of what evil man does to each other. If Jesus Christ were to come back to earth he would be crucified again. Man never learns his lesson and art exists to remind him of that fact. Roublev counters this with his own vision which is depicted on screen as he speaks in a stunning, lovingly depicted recreation much influenced by Breughel of his idea of a Russian Passion taking place in the snow. The scene is imbued with all the tenderness and compassion of an artist who genuinely puts himself at the service of both man and God. This is the perfection of artistic creation Tarkovsky aspires to and which he sees depicted in Roublev's great icons. This whole sequence is one of the most beautiful of any in Tarkovsky's films and speaks volumes about the humanity of the man's vision.

EPISODE 4: THE CELEBRATION (1408): Possibly because the previous episode pictures the very essence of beauty at the center of a Christian worldview, this episode focuses on the diametric opposite - the 'beauty' of a pagan worldview. The conflict between Christianity and paganism was the dichotomy which Russia must overcome if she was to be born as a united country and it's important that Tarkovsky both acknowledges this and includes it as one of Roublev's life lessons which will feed into his future creation of his 'Trinity'. Roublev, Daniil, Foma and others are in a boat en-route to paint the cathedral in Vladimir. They camp at a riverside where they find themselves witness to a pagan celebration of love. Naked bodies erupt from the trees, copulate on the ground, giving themselves to nature. Curious, Roublev observes a woman jumping over a fire inside a hut (a pagan ritual to purify the home) and is arrested and tied up by men who catch him spying. Left alone with the woman, he watches her strip naked and experiences probably his first kiss. At last she agrees to let him go and after a narrative ellipse he finds his way back to his party the following morning. As they continue on their boat an argument breaks out on the bank and a woman (possibly the same woman who seduced Roublev) escapes and swims across the river. She passes the boat, but its occupants ignore her. This sequence is obviously as enigmatic for the characters as it is for us in the audience. Clearly the purpose is to show Roublev accumulating more life experiences which will come in useful later when he crystallizes his artistic worldview more completely. As said, the contrasts between the pagan ritual and the Passion that precedes it is crucial for depicting the extremes involved in the society that surrounded Roublev and which his art would eventually reflect.

EPISODE 5: THE LAST JUDGMENT (1408): Here Tarkovsky deals with the subject of artist's block and explains Daniil's view on artistic creation which is contrasted to its disadvantage with Roublev's. The group from the previous episode have arrived at Vladimir where they have been commissioned to paint The Last Judgment. Roublev wants to paint a `happy' Last Judgment to give people hope. This contrasts with Daniil's view that the purpose of painting this subject is to terrify people and make them feel the wrath of God. This represents the `conformist' view of artistic creation. Why should an artist part with custom? He should simply do as expected. Roublev is torn between duty to precedent and duty to the people, but simply can't find the inspiration to follow through his ambition. This is explained in a somewhat obscure flashback to a time when Roublev was employed by the Grand Duke's brother. Stonemasons refuse to compromise their position on the decoration of a palace and leave for a better position - to paint for the Grand Duke himself. The brother lets them go, but later has their eyes gouged out so they will not be able to paint better for his brother. This announces the fratricidal conflict which will take center stage in the next episode. The cut from a stonemason bleeding milk into a stream to black paint being splashed angrily onto the wall of the church terminates the flashback and strongly suggests Roublev's artistic impulse is being snuffed out by the appalling social conditions which surround him. It is a test which he finally passes thanks to the arrival of a Holy Fool (Irma Rausch) who enters the church with her head uncovered. Daniil once again shows his conformist conservatism by frowning at this `sin', but Roublev interprets it as a sign that he should flout tradition and feel free to express what he wants. The Holy Fool releases Roublev's creative spirit and Part 1 of the film ends.

EPISODE 6: THE RAID (1408): By far the most dramatic of the episodes, Roublev is pushed very firmly to the side (we lose sight of him for a full 10 minutes) as Tarkovsky depicts the dark chaos of the times as the brother of the grand Duke introduced in the previous episode forms an alliance with a Tartar chief on the great Russian steppes before mounting a raid on the city of Vladimir. Tarkovsky's epic vision is shown at its very finest here as a city is sacked - buildings are burnt, women are raped and many lives are lost. The survivors of the raid gather in the cathedral and wait terrified as the Tartars go about breaking down the door. The hoards eventually enter and chaos descends. We find Roublev cowering in fright. The Holy Fool is taken away and is about to be raped when Roublev leaps to her defence. He axes her assailant to death and goes into immediate shock. He confesses his sin to an imaginary Theophanes which leads to him giving up his artistic vocation and taking a vow of silence. This whole episode is marked by the breathtaking way Tarkovsky shoots the action. The camera is moved with consummate skill with every shot centrally composed with frantic activity spilling over from all areas of the frame. Great contrast is made between `innocent' nature (horses, dogs, hens, doves) and 'sinful' mankind. Two shots in particular stand out - a horse falling from a rampart to be speared to death and an aerial shot of the crowd fighting below in slow motion as two doves are released from camera right. This is also the episode where Tarkovsky the cineaste appears. The raid on Vladimir has its counterpart in the raid on Kazan in Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible while the men, horses and dogs pouring over the plain towards Vladimir is strongly redolent of a similar scene in Part 2 of Lang's Die Nibelungen. Then there are the many echoes of Kurosawa, most obviously the death of Foma in slow motion which recalls an early scene in Seven Samurai. Freed of the need to relate the artistic debates and theological discourses of the other episodes, Tarkovsky here simply depicts the horrific reality of the turmoil splitting the would-be Russian nation in two. For now, the sheer horror of the violence paralyses Roublev, but it's a vitally important part of the education process preparing him ultimately for the creation of the 'Trinity'.

EPISODE 7: THE SILENCE (1412): This part shows the aftermath of the Tartar invasion and depicts the years of famine and plague which descend on the land. Roublev carries out his vow of silence living in the Andronnikov monastery accompanied by the Holy Fool. Two events take place. In one the Holy Fool is whisked away by a Tartar warlord. In the other Kirill appears after a long absense. He attempts to console Roublev for his loss. Roublev stays silent throughout. This episode is surely meant by Tarkovsky to allow the shock of the previous violent episode to reverberate as long and painfully as he can, to depict the suffering of the Russian people brought down by the abuse of power, and to provide time wherein we can prepare ourselves for Roublev's explosion back to life in the film's final episode.

EPISODE 8: THE BELL (1423): The beauty of this magnificent concluding episode lies in its simplicity. A boy Boriska (Nikolai Burlyaev) has lost his family to the plague. Agents of the Grand Duke come looking for his father who had been a famous bell maker. To save his own life Boriska claims his father passed on to him the secret of how to make bronze before he died and persuades the men to take him to Vladimir where he directs the making of a new bell. Roublev silently observes him as he goes about his work. Lovingly depicted by Tarkovsky we are awed by the process of bell construction until the day the bell is rung for the first time at which point all rejoice and Roublev is inspired to once again take up his vocation as an artist. There are many points to bring out in this miraculous sequence. First we have to appreciate the role of bells within the Russian Orthodox Church. Known as 'singing icons' they fulfill the same purpose as painted icons. They represent the very presence on earth of God Himself and the resulting spreading of the teaching of the gospels. Tarkovsky shows how the whole of society is united together by the casting of the bell, in other words by making God visable to the people through creative artistic endeavor. Boriska and his workers may be artisans but they employ peasant laborers who help at every stage. Once the bell is hung (a magnificently shot sequence showing long lines of men and women pulling on ropes) the Grand Duke and other members of his class come out to inspect the blessing of the bell and to hear the first ring. The ringing sends the assembled crowd into euphoria and as the royal entourage (replete with foreign guests from Italy) withdraws everyone bows to them in respect. The appearance of God through the bell has united the people together as one - this is the 'Trinity' of love, community and brotherhood that Tarkovsky talks about as depicted in Roublev's most celebrated icon.

Beyond the theme of the creation of modern Russia, of course the whole episode deals with the nature of artistic creation and unites elements that we have been observing for the past 2 hours. Boriska is an artist just like Roublev who goes about creating his icon in a way that literally demonstrates to Roublev how he can break his vow of silence and embrace his artistic calling once again. Note again Tarkovsky stresses how the bell is created out of the 4 natural elements. It is the heavy rain (water) which causes Boriska to slip down a hill and discover the clay (the earth) needed to make the mold in which the bell can be cast. The Grand Duke's bronze is melted (fire) and poured into the mold. The metal hardens by the cooling air into which the bell must be hoisted once the mold is broken. For the penultimate time Tarkovsky demonstrates how artistic creativity and nature are inter-dependent - without one the other cannot exist. Beyond the elements there is the way Boriska directs his workers, pushing them, scolding them, threatening them. He demonstrates to the on-looking Roublev how art is created through teamwork and inspired leadership. This is also of course the process by which Tarkovsky (or indeed any great artist) achieves his work. Tarkovsky adds a sense of circular completion as represented by the 'Trinity' by reintroducing characters from earlier in the film. The buffoon reappears to spot Kirill, the one that caused all his troubles. He seems to arrive at a kind of reconciliation. Kirill himself repents by admitting his faults from long ago and by urging Roublev to paint again. Most significantly of all at the sound of the first ring of the bell Tarkovsky cuts to the Holy Fool (on a horse!) who had abandoned him for a Tartar warlord in the last episode. She is wearing pure white and has a spiritual countenance (she may well be an apparition). In Russia the simple fool is considered to be 'touched by God' and just as her appearance in The Last Judgment brings about the epiphany that breaks Roublev's artist's block, so here her appearance inspires Roublev to unblock himself for the second time. The episode finishes on a tearful Boriska scrabbling in the mud confessing that he had lied about knowing the secret of the bronze in order to save his own life. Roublev gathers him up, promising to take him to Moscow where they will create the 'Trinity' together. Clearly for Tarkovsky artistic creativity is a giant leap into the unknown. Only an act of blind faith can result in the making of a masterpiece. Cue the change from b/w to the color of the epilogue to demonstrate what blind faith can achieve. As the images burn into our eyes and Ovchinnikov's Shostakovich-inflected score sears our ears the attentive audience has no option but be moved to tears here. And yet art does not exist purely for the glory of God. It exists for the glory of man as well and the final image of this extraordinarily moving film is a b/w image of horses standing in a meadow while the rain pours down - artistic creativity and nature forever bound to each other.

This is a review of the excellent first Artificial Eye release. The images are well defined and the sound clear. There are also some interesting extras - interviews with Tarkovsky and other members of the crew. It spreads to 2 DVDs which is not a problem as the two parts of the film take up a disc a piece and the break is natural. The only reservation I have is this is the foreign 185 minute version of the film which omits 20 minutes from the full Russian version. Tarkovsky was happy to release this shorter version, but I think the cut scenes (mainly the eye-gouging of Episode 5 and the horse-spearing of Episode 6) probably lessen the visceral thrill of the film. Animal rights activists might protest, but this is a film which relies much on its raw and unfettered depiction of Medieval times. Any attempt to minimize the shock value must surely be to the detriment of the film. It's good that the full 205 minute Russian version can be found on Criterion (the original print apparently came from Martin Scorsese's collection), but I have read that version has been blown up for wide screen and that this AE version is therefore probably the best. Whichever version you choose this is a glorious film which should be in every collection. It is quite simply one of the best films ever made.",1411257600,3,28958,4.841372351160444

This slow-paced film from the Soviet era goes on for over three hours like the endless Russian plains and would initially test the patience of any modern person.  But it is worth persevering to the end as you eventually realize why this is considered to be one of the best films ever made.

It is set in medieval Russia and basically has an underlying religious theme.  There is also a strange Russian mixture of passivity, spontaneity, and brutality.  It features numerous scenes, most of which seem to have nothing to do with each other.  Snow covered or drenched landscapes are a constant feature.  The strange opening scene appears to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.

It is hard to tell why the film is named after Andrei Rublev as he seems to be just one of many characters, unless you know that he is a famous Russian medieval icon painter.  But the movie is more about Russia in the time of Rublev rather than a story about Rublev.

While the film is basically a series of discrete events, after a while a plot emerges involving artists including Rublev who have received a commission to paint a church.  While they travel to the church in deplorable weather various scenes appear such as a surrealistic re-enactment of the crucifiction in snow and something close to a heathen orgy by a lake.  The plot then fades away but comes back here and there.

The part showing a Tartar raid on the town of Vladimir is particularly poignant.  It seems to be a very realistic portrayal of what these raids were like.  This is not the type of scene that is forgotten as soon as it is seen.  A large digression later appears involving a church bell maker.  Rublev re-enters the picture near the end and it appears he may have finished painting the church.

There is an important transition near the end that is so subtle that you may not realize it for a while.  The film ends by showing what must be the icon paintings of the real Rublev.  This film is certainly unusual and one of its attractions is just trying to figure out what it is all about.  Some of the scenes from medieval Russia take you to a completely different world.",1384905600,,2256,4.5209876543209875

995923,5,6305257450,"Andrei Rublev is a great Russian (Soviet-era) film from 1966 directed by the brilliant Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky (he who made ""My Name is Ivan"" and ""Solaris""). Andrei Rublev, the title character, was a 15th century Russian painter of icons (Orthodox Christian religious paintings). The film is not so much about Andrei Rublev as it is about art (the artist) and spiritual faith surviving in a harsh world filled with brutal evil. Tarkovsky is a poet and a master of metaphor: he knows how to provoke complex and powerful ideas and emotions in ways both sublimely beautiful and grotesquely disturbing.

The plot does not follow a standard Hollywood structure that would move the story arc seamlessly from beginning to climax to anticlimax (with everything explicitly explained along the way). The film is divided into seven chapters, with each chapter involving some activity that illustrates a Universal Human Theme. Well, I think the themes are ""universal""; I have been told (quite forcefully) that they are specifically Russian!

I have been told, ""You have to be RUSSIAN to understand this film!"" Okay, perhaps this is true. Even so, I loved it. It is visually fascinating and intellectually and emotionally powerful. The many characters are realistically diverse and complicated. The depiction of life in 15th Century Russia seems to be historically authentic.

There is quite a lot of explicit violence in this film, including human torture & mutilation and animal cruelty & killing. While the violence against humans is (obviously) faked, the killing of at least one horse is not fake (i.e., they really killed the beast). There is also nudity in this film.

995924,5,6305257450,"This film is all about symbolism. It is about man's attempt to reach to the sublime and transcendent while living through the eternal woes and toils of a hypocritical, harsh world.

There are many ways that men try to reach to heaven in this film: in the opening scene we have a proto-scientist/crazy peasant who achieves flight in a hot air balloon, only to come crashing down a few minutes later. In the second seen we have a buffoon/subconscious revolutionary who mocks the arbitrary ridiculousness of the rigid hierarchical world of boyars and priests only to have his tongue cut out. In the third scene we have the remnants of the pagans trying to overcome the dreary world of medieval Russia through the ways of the flesh.
Artists create great works and get their eyes gouged out by kings. Brother betrays brother and robs his own village. Tatars rape and pillage without mercy. The reality of this world is unflinching.

Finally, the end scene: a young boy engineers a giant church bell through his own wit and cunning. If he fails he will surely reach the same fate as those before him who displeased the ruling classes, but the bell is a success.

The symbolism in the beginning of the film, that of the yoke which stands over the peasants is replaced by the symbol of the hero slaying the dragon (the emblem of St. Michael emblazoned on the bell).

It is a symbol of alchemy, of man's constant risk-taking turned into the ultimate triumph, and thus this film is exceptionally optimistic about the human condition and its ability to transcend the mundane, brutal world by proper use of the Will. From the many Promethian attempts to gain freedom in the previous scenes we finally witness the Herculean effort.

My own interpretation of the bell is this: the boy takes all the metal of the boyars to make this bell. They therefore have no metal left to craft swords with, therefore the world of violence and repression can finally be replaced by a new generation of inventive, optimistic people who will rule by reason and not by the sword.

995925,4,6305257450,"... just what an art film should be!

If you enter into watching this film as ""regular fare"" you will be disappointed. If you watch it with the knowledge of it being an Art Film, you won't be disappointed. I expect art films to be a bit bizarre and I expect them to challenge me. This film was very challenging and I watched it over the course of two evenings.

While I'll spare the reader getting bogged down in any long-winded interpretations of all the symbology contained within the work, (you can get those elsewhere in these reviews) I can at least say that it's entertaining on a few levels. The acting is believable, the settings are incredible and the camera work and direction are superb. Many passage of film are some of the best black and white cinema I've seen, especially when the monk is drifting through and witnessing a village in an orgiastic, pagan ceremony of which they try to entice him into taking part.

The bell-making scenes are fascinating, but the few instances of animal abuse during the sacking of a town are not necessary and seem a bit gratuitous. The rest is a bit confusing and a bit long, but if you're sitting around on a rainy night and have nothing better to do, it can be somewhat interesting to watch. Trying to make sense of the story line is nearly impossible, so don't try. Rublev is there occasionally in three roles: main actor, supporting actor and cameo. Don't expect him to paint much. Don't expect a story of his life. Don't expect anything.

There are a few flashbacks to a specific scene where the three monks are taking refuge from the rain under a small bunch of trees. What significance this has to the story, I have no idea, but it did stay with me and when I think of this film, I think of that first section where they are walking in the rain and go under these seemingly useless trees to get out of it. It's one of those obtuse scenes that just seems odd, yet without it, the film would have zero thread to tie it together, in my opinion.",1317168000,2,1996,4.415760869565218
995926,5,6305257450,"How long will war, pain, and suffering go on this world? This film says: forever, most likely. This film is about the life and times of Andrei Rublev. Andrei Rublev was a 15th century Russian icon painter. He is actually considered to be the greatest medieval Russian painter of Orthodox icons and frescoes. In a fragmented fashion this film presents experiences Rublev has throughout out his life. He lives through a bloody raid and vows to never speak or paint again. He witnesses a young man experience a great artistic accomplishment and finds the strength to speak and paint again. Overall this film is a tough epic. It shows how hard life can be. It shows how the harsh realities of life can affect artist vision. You should watch this movie at any point in your life. Do not wait to be in the right mood to watch Andrei Rublev. That day will most likely never come. You should just jump in and see what you pull out. You must experience this film for yourself. The reason for this: Only through personal experience we understand life.  This is a tough film . Tough to watch, tough content, tough to think about , and tough to digest.

Andrei Tarkovsky:

An artist never works under ideal conditions
The artist exists because the world is not perfect
Art would be useless if the world was perfect
As man wouldn't look for harmony, but would simply live in it
Art is born out of an ill designed world",1303603200,2,1653,4.558922558922559
996037,5,6305257450,"Tarkovsky has made a number of memorable films, MIRROR, SOLARIS, STALKER, but the one that stands out for me as his greatest is ANDREI RUBLEV. This epic film works effectively on a number of levels:

As a harsh and at times brutal history of pre Tsarist (early 15th century) Russia.

As a meditation on the spiritual journey and as a parable of the timeless internal war between virtue and sin.

As a cinematic poem filled with beauty, terror, and pain, in equal measure.

As an allegory of the artist's struggle to find meaning and create beauty in an indifferent and at times cruel world.

Least of all as a fictional biography of the revered 15th century painter of religious icons, since it only covers 24 years of his life (1400-1424) and Rublev himself, of whom very little is known, is more an observer than an actual participant in much of the action.

ANDREI RUBLEV is filled with metaphors and symbolic images that are hard to forget, but difficult to explain in anything other than from a purely subjective viewpoint. The balloon flight and fall. The jester. The 3 monks, Andrei, Danil, and Kirill, each seeming to represent different aspects of the human personality. The reenactment of the Passion. The beating of the dog. The Tartar invasion of Vladimir. The burning cow. The fall and killing of the horse. The blinding of the artisans. The holy fool. The casting of the bell. Horses, symbols of life perhaps, are prominently displayed in this film, which ends (at the conclusion of the epilogue) with a scene of them grazing by a river in the rain. The cruelty shown to some of the animals may turn people off, and has been a source of controversy for years, but most of it was simulated and it's ironic that people often are more upset by that, than by the thought of countless numbers of human beings slaughtered and often treated worse than animals. Life having so little value at that time, is it any wonder religion was such a powerful influence? Marx's famous saying about religion being the opium of the people could have described Russia at the time Rublev lived, but more than an opiate, the Church and it's teachings about faith and the afterlife, were the only source of comfort for a people who lived under constant threat, from invading hoards, and the cruel whims of nature. Tarkovsky's film seems to be a strong arguement for faith and inspiration..an interesting counterpoint to the prevailing mindset of Soviet Russia at the time this film was made.

ANDREI RUBLEV (1966), is primarily filmed in black and white, and is a whopping 205 minutes long..but it is divided into 9 sections (including prologue and epilogue), so the length does not feel burdensome or detract from the overall impact. The narrative flows from one chapter to the next, like the stream we see several times in the film, and each is essential to the logical progression of the story and it's thematic development. Some of the scenes are remarkable in scope and involve very challenging cinematography. ANDREI RUBLEV is a distinctly Russian film, not just because of who made it, where it was made, and the subject matter, but because it has that ineffable thing called a ""Russian Soul"". This is simply a film that every serious lover of cinema must see..the cinematic equivalent of a Dostoevsky novel. It ends with a lovely epilogue filmed in color of the actual painted icons of Rublev, details of which are presented to us with a haunting background score. The last image is of ""Christ, the Redeemer"", which crossfades into the scene of the horses mentioned above. The perfect ending to a remarkable film.",1293494400,6,3611,4.786516853932584
996038,5,6305257450,"""Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema"" - Andrei Tarkovsky

Andrei Tarkovsky's experimental epic film does more than explore the life and development of the great Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev.  It is also a compelling and rigorous exploration of the nature of art.  Made while Tarkovsky was himself reflecting on the nature of his artistry and on the relation between his vision and the ideology and politics of the institutions that governed Soviet cinema, the film also raises questions about the obligations of the artist and the ultimate value of art.

There is a story arc here, that introduces us to an ambitious and talented young painter, and his companions and mentors Danill and Kirill, as they leave the monastery where they have lived and learned in order to find work elsewhere.  Andrei's success leads to friction with Danill and a break with the jealous Kirill, but he discovers that success carries with it the price of high expectations, and comes to wonder whether he can accommodate his personal vision to the demands of his benefactors.  A civil war in Russia and its devastating consequences leads Andrei to renounce painting and take a vow of silence, and the remainder of the story explores (experientially, historically and imaginatively) how it is that he returned to art in order to create the works at the Trinity Cathedral for which he is rightfully revered as the greatest of Russian icon painters.  While little is known about his life, especially before 1408, Tarkovsky ties the known incidents together with episodes that suggest both his personal development and the political background in which he worked.  One pivotal element of the period, for example, was the frequent Tatar invasions, which in some cases were in fact encouraged by Russians striving to achieve political power over rivals.  Another was the tension between the official orthodox religion and the lingering elements of pagan traditions among the peasants, exemplified here by the jester and the fertility rituals.

Tarkovsky is not, however, merely interested in delivering a psychologically and historically realistic portrait of the artist.  In fact, he suggests in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sculpting-in-Time/dp/0292776241/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sculpting in Time</a>&nbsp;that he encouraged his designers to shy away from strict historical accuracy in favor of simple designs that revealed an emotional truth.  More distinctive is his decision to include elements that establish a tone and theme, even if they are not strictly connected with the story of Rublev, such as the prologue that depicts a man who strives to escape into the air in a makeshift hot-air baloon constructed of skins and bladders.  The center of the film remains Rublev, but he is depicted as above all an observer, who cares about and is interested in people, reluctant to pass judgment.  He watches the bawdy jester, whose art consists in eliciting laughs and lightening moods during oppressive times; he observes the pagan fertility rituals, his curiosity putting him in a dangerous and precarious position; he is intrigued by the oblivious contentment of the holy fool who enters his cathedral when he is unable to make progress, and unwilling to depict the terrors of hell he had been commisioned to paint; he is fascinated by the bold but insecure Boriska, who falsely swears that his father had told him the secret to bell casting.

It is not an easy film to watch - Criterion has put together the nearly 3 and a half hour original cut, and Tarkovsky takes his time telling the story.  I know the first time I saw this, in an arthouse theater, I was overwhelmed and exhausted, and couldn't think of much else for a few days.  I just saw it again and had some of the same feelings.  Still, the invention with which the camera movements are developed and scenes are depicted makes for an exciting experience for lovers of inventive cinema.  It's gorgeously filmed, and the restoration looks good, though not perfect.  There remain some artifacts in this copy of wear and tear in the original print materials, and it is not as sharp as I remember the picture to have been when I saw a 35mm print projection more than a decade ago.  It looks pretty good on my television, but the imperfections show up when I project it through a very good Barco screen projector.  As other reviewers have noted, the widescreen is achieved through letterboxing, which means that even on a widescreen television you're going to get some seriously hefty black bars.  This is a film that deserves a re-release on Criterion, and I know I'll be first in line to pick up a new copy if and when they release it with higher standards.",1262390400,4,4927,5.063040791100123
996039,3,6305257450,"Straight up, ""Andrei Rublev"" is possibly my favourite film, the reason why I got turned onto cinema when I was 15 (some 14 years ago!). So the three stars are for the product rather than the film, which would get 5/5 every time from me. Secondly, I love Criterion DVDs: as a matter of fact, I received ""Breathless""/""Bout De Souffle"" today and I'm mightily impressed with the film transfer, packaging and extras that set has.
Much is made of the fact that this is the ""uncut"" version of the film. This may be so, but the twenty minutes that this version has over the Russian Cinema Council version (availaible on Artificial Eye in the U.K.) are generally not new scenes: rather they are extra shots that have been cut from the RUSCICO/AE release. For instance, when Kirill storms out of the monastery after the apparent snub by Theophanes, he beats a stray dog that chases him. In the AE release, the yelping of the dog is the only indication that he kills the animal; in the Criterion version, there is a shot of the dog writhing on the ground. This is not to indicate my distate for animal cruelty, but just that these shots don't in my opinion really add any profundidty to the film. Another example would be the jester's bare, er, posterior with a smiley face daubed on during the hut scene near the beginning, which the AE release omits: it's just bits and bobs spread throughout the film, not extra whole scenes, that's all.
This would be fine if the one-disc transfer was up the standard of the AE release (which splits the film between two discs, 99 and 86 minutes). It isn't. Perhaps it's because we are so used to good transfers onto DVD owadays, where even the no-frill Second Run and Eclipse relaeses are of a very high standard, that this release from 1998 seems sub-standard. The key is that the bit-rate is very low. I don't like the nerdy appraisal of a DVD by exact measurements of bit-rates, but it's clear that when the camera moves (for instance in the hut with the jester) the transfer isn't up to snuff. The rather washed-out look to the fantastic black and white photgraphy and the over-sized black bars further exaccerbate the irritation. Sure, ramping down 100Hz settings, black adjust, etc., the film is just about watchable, but the enormous black bars seem to be hiding the fact that this isn't a great transfer.

Great film, but get the Artificial Eye release. There are far, far better more recent Criterion discs to get before you think about getting this.",1248825600,25,2486,4.624434389140271
996040,5,6305257450,"This movie is difficult on the viewer because it's not so much about telling a story as about painting an era and presenting a human struggle that is largely an interior experience.
The story is the life of Russia's greatest icon painter, Andrei Rublev, about whom not much is known, so Tarkovsky has freedom to re-create him to suit his purpose. His only well documented work is the Holy Trinity now at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, and is considered Russia's best icon painting, which I saw while I was there as well as his attributed works in the Cathedral of the  Annunciation, they all have a unique beauty and spirituality that is superior to the works of other icons of that time. Rubiev was eventually cannonized by the Russian Orthodox church and is revered as a saint by the faithful.
More than a movie, it is a series of pictures and landscapes that portray Medieval Russia, it's beauty and its brutality are well represented.
The movie conveys the mystical atmosphere of that time, when faith was much more important than knowledge. The timing of the film makes it seem extremely long because the director is focusing on the beauty of the forest, a field of flowers or the details on a bough while the dialog does not necessarily help to clarify much. We do get a sense though that Rubliev, like all great artistic geniuses was a complex personality. The actor that plays him has a great ability to express nuances through his hand movements, the posture and even furtive glances. In many ways I feel the movie would have been even more successful as a silent work, and oddly enough, Rubliev takes a vow of silence and remains without speaking for a large portion of the film.
  The long closeups of the faces are like icon paintings, and I must say that the actors chosen look like the exact replica of the figures I have seen painted on icons. More than watching a movie, Rubliev is an experience in meditation and/or prayer. It requires a different patience than what's needed for a regular slow movie, because it is trying to use the visual images to create allegories, and because the length of the scenes or detailed closeups have  a powerful impact in memory. One of the magical aspects of the movie is that the experience of remembering it is much more pleasurable than actually seeing it.",1247097600,2,2312,4.659313725490196

I've read quite a bit about his films, but this is the first one that I've watched.  I mention this up front so that readers of this review can understand my perspective, I'm still trying to absorb what I saw.  In short, this is an incredible, thought-compelling film, probably one of the best ever made.  The praise for this film in some of the other positive Amazon reviews is well merited.  It is a story about faith and about life, but mostly about figuring out what it is we are meant to do with our lives.  Andrei Rublev is a painter of icons and cathedrals in the Orthodox Church in Russia during the late Middle Ages.  As a young man he is widely acknowledged as the best at his craft in Russia, and is summoned to work on some of the most important projects.  What follows is Rublev's lifelong journey through Russia.  We watch his maturity and evolution as he questions the nature of his work and the nature of his faith.  He witnesses some of the most brutal, cruel acts and treacheries by both friends and enemies.  What really makes this a great film is the timeless nature of it's central theme:  will we ever realize what it is we've been put on this Earth to do, even when it is staring us in the face?

This film will definitely take some discipline to sit through for 3+ hours, but you will be richly rewarded.  As I was watching the film, I initially had to agree that it was too long, but once you see how everything fits together, I think you'll come to the conclusion that all is part of the whole.  Tarkovsky wove a complex story in which the diverse themes presented early in the film are fully and richly developed as the film progresses.  There isn't a lot of action in this film nor is there a directly linear plotline.  This film is mostly dialog, so if `Lethal Weapon' is your kind of story, you should definitely avoid.  There are also a few brutally graphic scenes in this film, so be forewarned.  I'm sure that there is a great deal of symbolism in the film about communism, Russia, etc. that are totally lost on me.  If I was to make a literary comparison, this film is like the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Elias Khoury - a difficult read but worth the journey if you stick with it.

996044,5,6305257450,"I have owned the Criterion edition of this film a long time; I recently bought the Ruscico (Russian Cinema Council) edition and think I should try to make clearer the differences. This is not a critique of Tarkovsky's work -- that is beyond my capabilities.

As you may already know, the Criterion edition is taken from Martin Scorsese's personal print and represents the penultimate version of the film, while the Ruscico edition represents the release version, which is about twenty minutes shorter. However, Tarkovsky did more than pare twenty minutes off the film -- it's actually a somewhat different film, though the differences are not major.

To begin with, the Scorsese print (Criterion) has a completely different set of credit titles and intertitles, and at that stage the film was titled ""Strasty po Andreyu"" (Passion of Andrei). The release version (Ruscico) is titled ""Andrei Rublev"" and is not merely shorter: it contains shots that do not appear in ""Strasty po Andreyu"" (Criterion). Commenting on the DVDs themselves, the Ruscico DVD is much better looking. The subtitles (as one might imagine) are written by someone whose native language is Russian, and that is very important to me. When the subtitles are written by an English-speaker they are rendered in English idioms and subtle, specific meanings are often lost. Sometimes one cannot even tell what a scene is about. (There is a scene in Criterion's ""Ivanovo Detstvo"", for example, where the English-written subs completely obscure the point of a scene, while the Russian-written English subs in Ruscico's version make it perfectly clear.) Russian-written English subtitles are sometimes ungrammatical, use idioms whose meanings are unclear to non-Russian speakers, and sometimes even inadvertantly use a word from yet another language (French, in one case that I saw), but I'll take subs written by someone whose native language is that of the film any day. In fact, if you see a version of any foreign film with English-written subs first, then see a version where the English subs were written in the film's country of origin, it will be like seeing a whole new film. (A spectacular example is the difference between Kino's ""Zerkalo"" [Mirror] and Ruscico's -- there is NO comparison [Ruscico wins!], except that you have to avoid Ruscico's 5.1 audio remix and select the original mono.)

Additionally, an extra of great interest is hidden away on Ruscico's ""Andrei Rublev"" DVD. In the individual filmographies certain titles are highlighted: these are accompanied by trailers, three of which are for Tarkovsky films. These trailers are made up largely of shots that are entirely different from anything that appeared in the final film, so should be of absorbing interest to any fan of his work.

To sum up: Although I prefer the long version represented on Criterion's disk (""Strasty po Andreyu""), the Ruscico disk has a superior image, better subtitles (to my way of thinking), and fascinating extras if you can find them. Get both DVDs.",1209859200,18,3015,5.134419551934827
996045,3,6305257450,"When you work in the world of film, you start to look at things differently then you may have looked at them before.  If I was to say that I loved the ""story"" of 'Andrei Rublev', I would be a liar.  In fact, I hated it vehemently as I just viewed it again for the first time in a few years; BUT as a piece of filmmaking art, I can look at the typical Tarkovsky long and lingering shots and appreciate  the work of a man in love with his camera.  Tarkovsky's work appeals to me, not for his ability (or lack thereof) to tell a story, but to create mood.  Now that is not appealing to many people, and certainly not worth the $ to pay for a DVD or VHS copy of this film. (Note: there are several versions of this film available that vary in length due to various edits this film has undergone.)

If you are planning on learning about an religious icon painter named Andrei Rublev, this film will not teach you anything, because what little to nothing is known about him is merely conjecture here on Tarkovsky's part.  Tarkovsky's idea of plot is a bell, a jester and  tartar hordes which frankly , in my mind, make no real sense; BUT, again, if you are viewing the film to learn about Tarkovsky's work as an artist, by all means rent this.  It is, in my view, almost ponderously langorous (if that makes sense!).  You must have an attention span that even outlasts mine (which is darned good frankly!).",1208476800,6,1400,4.268939393939394
996046,1,6305257450,"I have a habit of returning to films that I don't care for because I am always interested to see if my opinions will change.  This is my third time through ""Andrei Rublev"" since last winter.  I have now spent over 10 hours viewing this film from many angles;  I have looked at it from the religious, the political, the pagan, the historical;  I have read what precious little there is to read about the real 15th-Century Iconographer; I have read about the writer/director Tarkovsky and his symbolism....and, for me, this film does not reach me on any level.  Why?

Tarkovsky wanted to make a statement about his beloved Russia and how he saw it's decline during the Soviet Years.  He, along with co-writer Andrei Konchalovsky, chose the character Andrei Rublev, considered to be Russia's greatest iconographer (religious images) and wrote a purely fictional account of the iconographer's life and struggle with art and faith and the conditions that prevailed in 15th-century Russia for peasants and artists under The Grand Prince and also under continuous Tatar Invasions.  Through using historical Russian History as a backdrop, Tarkovsky portrays this monk through seven chapters of life from 1400 to 1412.  Tarkovsky shows us peasants ,pagans, Tatars, Church Priests, inserts tons of Scripture from Ecclesiastes (the vanity of man) and Paul's First Letter to The Corinthians (the great Love chapter), and attempts to tell the ""struggle"" of an artisan who is to go from Church to Church and commission to commission to paint Icons (religious images).  Three hours, Tarkovsky never shows one icon being painted, making it very plain that this film is not solely about the life of an artist.  Why choose an iconographer and never show one icon?  Wait... at the end of this black-and-white ""masterpiece"", as it is often referred, we are at last allowed to see, in color, icons that were ""attributed"" to this obscure monk, Andrei Rublev.  The final icon, ""The Trinity"" is actually the ONLY icon that can be absolutely ascribed to Rublev.  In Tarkovsky's words, his choice of black-and-white filming was motivated by his claim that ""in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors.  Consequently Rublev's life is in black-and-white, whereas his art is in color.""  I could not personally disagree more with Tarkovsky's assumption about how a person views life.  That is why, for me, this film is strictly Tarkovsky, and nothing more.  I don't agree with his views, nor do I like his film.  My opinion only here!

If you expect to know anymore about the artist than what is known, you will not; Tarkovsky uses this man to show that the Soviet's have ignored The Scriptures and Russian History. This is a sociopolitical film that was intended (through reading Tarkovsky) to ""show an artist's maturing and development of his talent"" and to show ""the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives.""  I do not feel that this film expresses this in the least.  Sorry....call me a Philistine if you must, but this film  was not enjoyable or informative nor plummets the depth of an artist's soul except in Tarkovsky's mind.

The film does contain animal cruelty, which I find offensive. A cow was placed in an asbestos suit and then set aflame for one shot during carnage.  Another shot shows a horse stumbling down stairs and impaling itself.  Tarkovsky notes that the horse was first shot for the scene and then taken to the slaughterhouse!

On my third time through this ponderous film,  I used Tarkovsky's guide that is published on the Internet, to see if I could appreciate the film and understand it any better.  I could not.  I think this film needs to be viewed solely for the purpose of understanding Tarkovsky's vision as an artist in the Soviet Regime, and not for anything else.  You will either get it or not.  I admittedly did not and do not.  The film contains very long shots which, stylistically, is a Tarkovsky trademark.  The narrative is extremely dull and very confusing without the guide.  With the guide, you will only understand the confusion.  I have honestly tried to get more out of this film than I have been able to get.  I find in it nothing inspiring or interesting or artistically or cinematically that should warrant a label of ""masterpiece"".  To each his own.  Granted I have loved films that others deplore, but for me, this is the last time for ""Andrei Rublev.""",1207872000,41,4441,4.894243641231593

Outlawed by the Soviet government, this classic chronicles the life of the titled Russian Orthodox monk as he paints splendid, although controversial, icons to decorate cathedrals and enhance the faith during the 15th Century.  From the first aerial shot of a peasant gliding on a balloon to some of the battle scenes with the Tartars, the movie intensely zeroes in on its subject matter.  Some of the frames show war and torture like few others, making it as urgent as today's films.  Famed Director, Tarkovsky, also captures personal strife well from scene to scene, so the tension seldom falters.

This film also contains an incredible acting performance by the town jester near the front of the film.  I believe the actor is Sergeyev.  Diminutive bald man who takes over the film whenever he appears and I have never seen an actor seem more at home in such an odd setting.

Overall, this film moves slow and it will confound you and blow your mind.  Tarkovsky succeeds in re-creating the incredibly exotic and ineffable culture of 15th century Russia, Dark Ages Russia.  I cannot imagine there will ever be a film that gives a better sense of what it would have been like to live in the Dark Ages.

996108,5,6305257450,"I suppose it's a tribute, to the profound strength, of Tarkovsky's Imagery, that they stayed in my mind, for about 3, or 4 years. During this span of time, various images, from the movie ""Andrei Rublev"" would keep rising from the depths of my psyche. Some stressful event would occur, in my life, and images, from that strange movie, that I had seen, would automatically arise.

I just happened to run across a showing of ""Andrei Rublev"", on one of those ""artsy"" cable channels, given to foreign films... I think it was ""The Sundance Channel"". Through the years, I had forgotten the name of the movie. It was just, recently, within the last month, that I really started to search for the movie.

One of the outstanding images captures the sheer terror, and helplessness, of being in Medieval Russia, during the invasion of Tator, or Mongol Tribes (this distinction is not clear).

The images unwind, in dreamlike fashion, and Tarkovsky leaves us to our own inner meanings. There is the eternal battle, of good v.s. evil. There is the misery of the downtrodden, then, the triumph of the human spirit. In the end, I think we gain a new appreciation, of the human need, for ritual, and iconic imagery, found in all civilizations. Upon these images we infuse our hopes, our dreams, and the very future of humanity.",1171843200,9,1310,4.7368421052631575
996109,5,6305257450,"Like the review I just read, Tarkovskies' ANDRE RUBLEV is the movie that I keep coming back to over the years. It is my favorite film and has been until something as special comes along.

More than any filmmaker in any country, in any language, this movie has imparted and impressed it's viewpoint into my perception. I have incorporated it into my vision. I resonate with it... It plays me like a bell.

It is not an entertainment really though much of it is entertaining.  This film transcends both entertainment and mere artistic success -  the images and themes are so spiritually charged and archetypically strong that one may have the sense while watching it, that he or she is remembering half forgotten dreams.

Like the person whose review I just read, I often pause in simple wonder after a chapter just to let it ring.

The film chronicles the life and spiritual development of Russian artist, Icon painter

Andre Rublev.  The epic unfolds in 6 chapters the last of which introduces another artist, a young Church bell maker. The chapter reveals aspects and components of the creative process both literally and in allegory ...one senses that the filmmaker Tarkovsy and the young bell-maker may have a great deal in common and that he may have written himself into this section....this last chapter ""Spring"" is shot through with a narrative vitality, an energetic quality to the expression that is simply colossal -  there is a joy in the unfolding and discovery of this bell-makers  own creative powers...all of which is witnessed by the aging jaded Andre Rublev who is, as a witness, transformed by what he sees, as will be anyone who has eyes to see and apprehend the naked wonder of this last chapter.

Andre Tarkovsky made this film in what used to be the USSR  during a period of rigid and scrutinizing censorship. He used the artistic restraints and the hoops he had to jump through to a brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic and spiritual themes into the chapters of this epic.  The constraints seem to have served to discipline and streamline the narrative...the result is golden ...more truth per foot of film than any I can compare it to.

I saw it first on video in college in a russian art history class, later bought the dvd, and more recently attended a screening at Disney Studios that  colleague was given the invite to but couldn't make.  I brought someone who just didn't get it.

Tarkovsy  is not for everyone though you should give yourself the benefit of the doubt because, if he IS for you, you may very well be changed and touched  and rewarded again and again by this truly timeless gem.",1158624000,7,2645,4.74835886214442
996110,5,6305257450,"Andrei Rublyov (1969) by Andrei Tarkovsky is my number 1 (shares with Tarkovsky's Zerkalo) film of all time. It is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever. The beauty of every frame is exquisite - I have to pause film very often just to admire it. There are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as Andrei Rublyov did. I am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for Tarkovsky, it is very well paced, and I am never tired of its 3+ hours running time.

Film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter Andrei Rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism, and later by Tatar invaders. Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film: what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God, the Artist and the Power.

The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me, the last chapter of the film, ""The Bell"" is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it. Boriska sobbing like a child after his Bell rings - and he is a child, a boy, lonely and lost; Andrei breaking his vows of silence, his words to Boriska of hope, of many roads they would walk together. Andrei's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire, their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity, their melodic lines and pure joyful colors, the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery, quiet knowledge and sadness, looking inside themselves and inside our very souls; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this Earth, to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the ""swiftest birds"" of pain and death can't reach you...",1154476800,5,1855,4.469026548672566
996111,4,6305257450,"In its take-no-prisoners approach to filmmaking, Andrei Rublev reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's self-indulgent masterpiece, Apocalypse Now.  Tarkovsky's film is a biography of a fifteenth century monk renowned for his painted religious icons.  Rublev was Russia's equivalent of Michelangelo, and some of the works attributed to him display a formidable beauty which is all the more remarkable because they were created during a rude and violent time.

The film is told through a series of loosely linked episodes in which Rublev is either central, peripheral or irrelevant to the action on the screen.  The film's brilliance and self-indulgence are evident right in the opening sequence.  A man is paddling a canoe across a river to get away from a gang of pursuers.  When he reaches the other side, he ties himself to a primitive hot air balloon and takes off into the sky.  High above his tormentors, he experiences a vertiginous joy.  We do too, thanks to some truly innovative camera work.  The man's exhilaration is cut short when the balloon loses air and crashes into a horse, killing him instantly.  What this has to do with Rublev is not much, other than metaphorically - man tries to soar above the danger and chaos of this life, only to crash back down into the mud.

As he wanders to the various churches he is commissioned to paint, Rublev is sorely tried.  He's tempted by lubricious pagan women, nearly dies during the sack of Vladimir (a horrific and mesmerizing bit of filmmaking) and loses a half-wit girl he's trying to protect to a band of roving Tartars.  When he's afflicted, Rublev retreats into the scriptures.  His real triumph is not his art, but that he managed to hold on to the spirituality that made his art possible.  Like the calm that Vermeer created during a period of religious and political turbulence in Europe, Rublev's faith becomes a triumph over reality rather than a retreat from it.

Tarkovsky's use of lingering long shots combined with abrupt cuts between the chapters give the movie a static, yet elliptical feel.  It creates an odd narrative rhythm, but it's not dissimilar to viewing a great icon, which has both a stillness and a sense of underlying mystery, which is the mystery that attaches to faith.

In the end, the whole of Andrei Rublev is greater than the sum of its fascinating but disjunctive parts.  Its various episodes bear witness to the heroic effort required to make art during a nasty and brutish era - not unlike Tarkovsy's efforts to bring his idiosyncratic vision to the screen under a totalitarian regime committed to social realism.  Be patient with this movie, let it lead you where it will, and you will be amply rewarded.",1154304000,18,2699,4.851528384279476
996112,5,6305257450,"I tend to agree with the high praise here, but I have a few thoughts to add.  First off, every shot is beautifully photographed and there are some simply amazing tracking shots. In that sense, this is an ""art"" movie if there ever was one, perhaps reflecting it's (alleged) subject matter. Little of this seems flamboyant for its own sake. Another aspect worth note is the medieval ""feel"" of the movie. At times it really seems as if someone took a film camera back 700 years or so. Oh, and it should be mentioned what tremendous testicles Tarkovsky must have had to take as his subject matter, in early 1960's Russia, a renowned medieval icon painter. This had to be a mighty thumb of the nose to the Soviet state and arguably an act of subversion.

Pacing is slow, but no more glacial than movie like 2001, or Once Upon A Time In America, say.

But here's the brass tacks for the novices to know: this movie is episodic to say the least, and the only film I know of wherein the title character takes a lengthy vow of silence. When the vow is finally up, the movie seems to lose interest in Andrei altogether, and he becomes a background figure.  But it's here, finally that Tarkovsky shows what he can do with a straight ahead narrative--although that narrative isn't about Andrei. It's about the young son of a newly deceased bell maker, who insists that his father has told the secrets of bell making only to him. It'll mean his head if he's b.s.-ing, and we as viewers aren't sure.  And here's where the movie picks up pace and emotional power.  How much this power relies on the two previous not-too-seemingly-connected hours is hard to say.

Oh, and Vladimir gets sacked. Convincingly.

There are images and scenes that will stick to your ribs. It will help if you're already interested in art, religion, Russia, or splendid cinematography.  Or bell making, come to think of it. If one of your neighbors begins a medieval smelting process in their back yard, odds are they've been inspired by this film.",1146873600,5,2009,4.589385474860335
996113,5,6305257450,"I first saw this film in a letterboxed version (good), but with white on white subtitles (meaning the subtitles were unreadable).  Nevetheless, I knew that I was watching something worthy.  Then Fox Lorber put out a VHS version with the subtitles on the letterbox, and I knew I was right.  It's a magnificent film, one of the greatest spiritual films ever made, and one of Tarkovsky's 3 best (Solaris and Stalker being the other two).  The scenes don't flow in a traditional sense (similar to Kubrick films like 2001 and Full Metal Jacket, where there are no real transistions between the acts), but they flow in an emotional sense.  The film concerns itself with the title character, an actual monk who had painted some magnificent icons throughout his life (some of which still exist today).  Little was known about his life, so Tarkovsky was left free to interpret his life as he saw fit.  Certain scenes stay in your soul forever, especially the climatic scene, where the young bell caster forges a magnificent bell, and Rublev is so moved he starts to paint again (Rublev had taken a vow of silence earlier in the film and refused to paint anymore, as he didn't think his art was worth doing).  Then you see remnants of Rublev's icons at the end of the film in glorious colour.  The film was enormously controversial in the USSR.  It was completed in 1966, but not released until 1971.  This Criterion DVD is the original version, running 205 minutes.  There is a version that runs 185 minutes as well.  Both of these versions were made with Tarkovsky's approval.  The problems with the film were, among other things, that it was very violent and it had a lot of religious themes which were unheard of in the USSR (it was offically an atheistic state).  So Tarkovsky would eventually cut 20 minutes.  This 205 minute version was his first version, but it's not officially a ""director's cut"".  I believe this is the version to see, because it was Tarkovsky's first one.  It's a moving, deeply spiritual film, one that gets more profound everytime you see it.  Tarkovsky's films never grow old, as you always see them differently everytime you watch them.  You never grow weary of them.  They are truly magnificent.",1146182400,3,2218,4.738903394255875

On one hand you see this world of great Christian artists, who live for their work.  On the other hand, you see the world of invaders.  Remember the scene where the invaders lock the entire village in a church?  The torture scenes are not very grafic, but the implications will make you sick to your stomach.  At some point they invaders pour melted metal into the mouth of one of their victims, to silence his prayers, and then put a sack over his head and drag him outside, tied to a horse.  And between these two world is a world of pagans.  They are a cast suspended between the two universes.  They are Russians but not Christians.  They are an echo of the heathen Russia.

The stark black and white photography is incredible, and the many silent moments in the film say more than the sparse dialogue. Although the story is chopped up into parts, (not all containing the protagonist in person,) the film enables the viewer to make up their own conclusions, and find their own meanings. Some of the scenes and images will stay with you for a long time because the visual elements are so powerful. The only problems in the film is it's overlong length, and the color sequence at the end  which doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the narrative.

996238,5,6305257450,"You won't see this from Hollywood.  A movie that is not just a cinematic masterpiece but a work that comes close to the high water mark of artisitic achievement in the history of man.  I say this despite the obvious flaws in the movie.  It is beautifully shot, paced, and written, with a message of hope amidst suffering and hardship.

The first time I saw Rublev, I was puzzled.  Not at the story, but because it was so different from anything I had seen before.  I had strong feelings that I had just viewed something great, but I wasn't quite able to process it all.  It was the next morning when I started to realize how much the movie had meant to me.  Tarkovsky was said to have prefered images to symbols, since latter are closed off to further meaning.  Images allow layers of interpretation, and allow the interpretation to expand.  This kind of experience is organic and continues over time.

Some reviewers seem to have viewed Rublev as a religous film.  I didn't see it that way.  There are religous themes here-he was a monk afterall, and it is medieval Russia- but Rublev is mainly the story of the struggles of an artist in a cruel world.  It is also about the nature of true art, and the creative process.  There are many themes here and everyone will draw something different from it.

One thing that struck me,and saddened me, was when I realized how different most Hollywood directors would have handled many of the scenes in Rublev.  Tarkovsky has a style that lets the scene speak for itself, making the experience exponentially more powerful than the sledgehammer approach, which I imagine someone like Spielberg would insult us with.  I am thinking mainly here of the Tartar raid and the scene of the people huddled in the church.

Reviewers have mentioned the lack of continuity in certain places.  I don't think this was Tarkovsky's design, done to challenge the viewer.  I know that at least two chapters of the original screenplay were never shot.  The first would have been the battle of Kulikov, which would have set the stage for the whole movie.  The second was a  chapter which explained the Holy Fool character and her transition in the movie.  Supposedly Tarkovsky was short on money and left the two chapters out.",1121644800,10,2248,4.659033078880407

The closest analogy I can offer is that watching the film is like viewing fine paintings in an art gallery or savoring the taste and aroma of vintage wines. Visually the scenes are striking with many panoramic views.  The use of black and white (until the very last few minutes of the film) creates a hypnotic, dream-like effect that heightens the mood of the scenes.

But I must say this movie has great character portrayals that can be applied to people from novels to real-life. The many groups represented in the film range from the nobility (a major social moving force as twin princes struggling for power), the religious (with the three main monks representing various attitudes toward religion), the pagans, and finally the artists. The 3 main monks are 1) the talented but confused Andrei Rublev, 2) the mediocre and self-righteous Kirill, and 3) the quiet and focused Danil. The artists Theophanes, Foma, and Boriska really keep the movie in focus just as a real art director of the movie would do. Their attitudes toward faith and art are what helps the viewer understand Rublev's own attitudes toward faith and art. Though Rublev is the main character, he is at many times in the background. The viewer is after all, meant to become Rublev, and therefore Rublev is less visual. Brilliant device by Tarkovsky!

In the end it is the characters of the ""idiot girl"" and the jester which cleverly help the viewer understand the some of the character and actions of Andrei Rublev. At one point in the movie, Rublev splatters paint on the wall as a sign of protest against the jealous prince who has ordered the blinding of some painters. Everyone around Andrei is baffled by his actions since he does not attempt to justify them. It is however the idiot girl who although lacks reason, has the insight to understand the violence depicted. The idiot girl after all sees the paint and mistakens it for blood and in doing so receives the correct message. The jester likewise, helps the viewer understand two things about Andrei Rublev's character. The first thing noted is that when the jester has part of his tongue cut out, he still does not waver in continuing his art of comedy. Andrei on the other hand, at one point stops painting and speaking, and as a result he willfully becomes more mute than the jester. Finally the second thing noted is that because Andrei has choosen to give up his art of painting, he has in essence become as lukewarm as his fellow monk Kiril. Andrei in fact resembles Kiril so much so, that the jester attacks him thinking he is Kiril (the monk responsible for denouncing him).

Movies like ""Andrei Rublev"" are rarely ever made. The director Tarkovsky was not called ""the Poet of the Cinema"" for nothing. His works such as ""Andrei Rublev"", were just that: poems.  A poem like ""Andrei Rublev"" has lots of imagery used to convey some deeper meanings. Andrei Rublev appeals to scholars of the cinema and art technique as well as history buffs who want a social commentary along the lines of ""Alexander Nevsky"". But in the end, ""Andrei Rublev"" has a strong appeal to those who have strong religious convictions and struggle to match those convictions with their actions. The film is ultimately about individuals fulfilling their calling in life despite setbacks, be it due to social conflict or personal tragedy.

The movie is most rewarding when watched with the same patience and perseverance that one would have reading a novel by Dostoevsky. Even the opening scene of the flying balloon stimulates conversation as to its purpose and relation to the rest of the movie.

Finally, a great but often overlooked part of ""Andrei Rublev"" is its soundtrack. The soundtrack of ""Andrei Rublev"" like that of ""Saving Private Ryan"", is not explosive so as to be immediately ingrained in the viewer's mind (see Star Wars). The music instead sets the mood and tone of the movie. It does not distract the viewer from the visual poetry of the movie (for example there is the utmost silence during the slow-motion horse scene). So would Andrei Rublev be any different without a soundtrack? Yes it would. Even though the message of the movie would ultimately be the same, the possible religious experience drawn from it would be delayed by the lack of tone set by the music.

I cannot give this movie enough praise. It is a must-see for anyone who has strong religious convictions. ""Andrei Rublev"" is capable of not only stirring the depths of the soul but of also creating a predisposition and atmosphere for conversion. ""Andrei Rublev"" is by far my favorite movie of all time.

The DVD picture is great although the audio commentary could not be any drier. Still the restored scenes and extra Russian translations make up for it. Criterion on the whole does an excellent job transfering this movie to DVD.

I found this to be one of the most detailed, metaphorical studies I have ever seen - impossible to digest in just one viewing.

What Tarkovsky made with this film may be one the most overwhelming and haunting achievemnts in all the story of the world cinema.
Rubliov is a icon painter who after an important fac, decides not continue in that office.
The powerful of the barbarian invassion into a church, where he acquires the human experience gets far away the world, he isolates and becomes in a wanderer.
The unforgettable images that appear before the viewer are of a trascendental poetic beauty never seen before and even now.
All the journey along the Russia of XVI century is a reflexive gaze of the human condition , the sense of the life and how dealing with it, the unsaid code of one must behavior humanly, even in inhuman conditions, facing the world, with his singleness, its little moments of joy, his infinite sadness and its miseries.
The opening sequence in which the fall is shown before us, is a original metaphor of how facing with the failure; and is depicted with such kind of beautiness that mesmerizes you. No other film n the story, with the exception of the ending of A man escapes from Robert Bresson reveals with so frehness and vitality the epic sense before the life.
When Rubliov knows this teenager, in the final chapter, and faces with him the huge challenge that implies to make the asgned mission, turns back Rubliov and it invites him to keep on going in his mission or the moira term greek, his place in the universe, his meaning in this brief stage in the world.
This superb masterpiece, has countless remarkable sequences, the dialogues are feed of a blissness and poetic raprure without a drop of effectism.
When the mission is completed, and everybody celebrates the fact our young hero remains alone and Rubliov will gather with him and will tell wisdom words that I must not tell.
This is the goal of the artist; he must go to the forrest and seek the mushrooms; the people will be just waiting from the safe place for him; and no matter how dangerous or hazardous be the journey; they only expect for your bag. They will consume these gifts; but the creator must seek them.
Tarkovsky was in the middle of the creative universe (remeber his father Arseni Tarkovsky was a poet)in 1966; the script has an inner mytical force ; and every bit of this film is sublime, perfect.
Tarkovsky showed what many film makers haven't been able to do; express with a camera such landscape of images, in all his whole meaning.
Andrei Rubliov will be always a landmark ; an eternal triumph ; a epic statement that will be with all of us till the end of our lives.
And even more.",1085184000,7,2751,4.637295081967213
996351,5,6305257450,"Andrei Rublev is probably the greatest looking film of all time. It was shot on a Konvas (you can pick one up on Ebay for $1000) and film students will be stunned by what has been achieved in terms of cinematography with such an old and dated 35mm motion picture camera. It is inspirational in terms of film-making and this is the core reason why you should watch the film. If you are interested in Kino Art then Andrei Rublev can probably lay claim to the greatest art film ever made. If you are looking to experiment with Tarvoksky, then Andrei Rublev is not a bad place to start.
Like most of Tarkovsky's films, Andrei Rublev is extremely artistic, conjectures much on the human condition, metaphysics and Russian life - that all seem to have some hidden meanings that contains the film's truth that Tarkovsky expounds on - namely the wickedness of men and the temptations that they face. It is also about triumph of the will and the nature of man. This is all done via the ""narrative"" and the look of the film. Tarkovsky mixes moments of dialogue about the metaphysical (a doctrine that would continue to be a theme in all of this other films giving a sense of what was to come - especially the intricateness of Stalker, Solaris), arrestingly simple and slow cinematography (his trademark water shots), complex action sequences (there are full scale battles like from a Kurosawa movie) and visionary set designs (15th century villages, towns and cities). This is Tarkovsky's biggest film ever (and quite possibly the biggest Russian film ever).
The premise is complex. Andrei Rublev, a monk with the gift of painting, is invited to paint churches around the country and in Moscow. Between travelling from job to job he encounters - monks who have lost their faith, monks with too much faith in themselves, fools who are imprisoned for their beliefs, Wicca festivals (the pagan ceremonies of St. John's night), murder, torture (the Russian crucifixion), death, error, the sacking of towns by the Tartars (the sacking of Vladimir), vows of silence and of course the most striking final piece of the film - the making of the bell (the casting of the bell). Characters appear and disappear (a cinematic technique found in The Thin Red Line), but there is also a lot of hidden imagery (every time you watch it you find something new), in particular scenes of novice monks putting dirt on their cheeks which makes no sense at the time yet later on we seen Andrei put the same dirt as a stain on a church he has painted because of the bureaucratic blinding of artists (an extremely violent scene of which there are many. As a note: Andrei Rublev happens to be an extremely violent film and there are several disturbing scenes. Also a scene where a horse falls down a stairs was cut because of animal cruelty but this has been restored for the DVD). All of these scenes are done via several chapters that each tells a story in which Andrei Rublev is present either as the central character of focus, a participant or an observer. If you pay close attention to the chapters you will realize that the themes of each chapter are contained in all the chapters. Tarvoksky plays with the audience in so many ways that you can only hope to watch the film again and again until you make ALL of the connections. You will likely not see a more striking film for imagery. The ending is obviously what got Kubrick working on his trip scene in 2001. Tarkovsky returned a nod by filming Solaris.
Andrei Rublev is shot in monochrome although the ending does a little Wizard of Oz for us. The story is divided between two discs. You have 86 minutes in the first disc and 99 in the second for a grand running time of 185 minutes. This DVD is PRICEY but this is Kino Art at its finest and worth every penny. The extras are many and there are some very important historical interviews about Tarkovsky. However I will say that DVD is totally unsuitable for Tarkovsky's films and possibly you will do better to watch a widescreen video or even better a 35mm print of the film in the cinema next time it comes to town. Even though the transfer is sublime for a 1966 picture (a Russian one at that) and there has been a lot of digital correction, the DVD produces artefacts on nearly all of Tarkovsky's films because of his complex imagery, but this is just quibbling and is not the fault of the DVD producers. Tarkovsky has simply exceeded the limits of what DVD mpeg compression can handle, even after this film is spanned over 2 discs... and that says a lot about the quality of this man's vision.
Kino Art does not come much better than Andrei Rublev.",1082937600,15,4628,4.590579710144928
996352,5,6305257450,"I had never seen a Tarkovsky film before ""Andrei Rublev"", but I intend to see more. This film was *very* different, but very good, and I was moved by it on many different levels.
Set in Russia in the early 15th century, this film is based on the life of Andrei Rublev, an icon painter and arguably Russia's first great artist. It's told in a series of vignettes that don't always focus on Rublev; many times he is either a background observer or not involved at all. He is a device that Tarkovsky uses to tell a grander tale, a tale about art, life, humanity, history, faith, good, evil and other philosophical ideas that most filmmakers fear like the plague. This film is much more than a historical epic, it is a work of art, and possibly more than that a path to enlightenment.
Like many of the greatest directors, Tarkovsky is more than just a filmmaker. He is an ARTIST, possibly more so than any director I've ever encountered. For example, most directors use techniques like music and editing to elicit specific emotions from the audience, but Tarkovsky uses few to no manipulative devices. Scenes are typically wide, sweeping, epic shots, which often linger for up to several minutes. The viewer is allowed to absorb the situation and the imagery, to internalize them and let them sink into the subconscious. If one is still and contemplative, one will enter into a dialogue with the film and begin to experience it on a higher level.
The film lacks a tightly knit plot, and there's no pat morality tale. Rather it is LIFE, boiled down to its essence. Scenes feel real, and often play out in real time according to the rhythm of life. Characters will sit and wait, and we wait with them. Incidents unfold in real time, with no cuts and nothing edited. Tarkovsky uses the natural world a great deal. For instance, a character will chance upon the carcass of a snow-white egret mired in the swamp, or a somber procession will scale a snowy embankment where the mud has bled through like a pair of weeping eyes.
It's a work of art, I've established that, but I also love the historical setting. Fifteenth century Russia was grim and unforgiving. Orthodox Christianity was the official religion, but paganism was still commonplace. Boyars, kings and princes frequently skirmished with one another. Tartars from the south took advantage of the regional instability to sack villages and cities. Plague and sickness were rampant, and the vast majority of people lived in abject poverty. But the so-called ""Dark Ages"" were nearly at an end. Art and ideas from West were steadily infiltrating the East. Rublev himself was inspired by a Greek painter named Theophanes, a relationship depicted in the film. Tarkovsky captures the period perfectly in ""Andrei Rublev"", and to me it seems like the next thing to being there.
Having said ALL that, I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to most people. Here are all the reasons a modern filmgoer probably would not like ""Andrei Rublev"": it was filmed in black and white; it's old (originally released in 1966); it's long (the unedited Criterion release is nearly 3 and a 1/2 hours); it's in Russian with subtitles; at least one animal was brutally killed during the filming (for which there is NO excuse - shame on Tarkovsky); scenes linger for several minutes without cuts or editing; it's arty (though not pretentious); it's very difficult to understand; it requires repeated viewings and you may never fully ""get it""; it's told in a series of vignettes with only a loose overarching narrative; etc., etc. If none of that scares you off, you should definitely check it out, because it's a real gem.",1070668800,16,3652,4.789223454833597
996353,5,6305257450,"Andrei Rublev is a unique and challenging masterpiece set in Medieval Russia, loosely based on the life of a real monk renowned for his Icon paintings. Starkly and beautifully photographed in black and white, its austere settings and classic compositions as well as its depiction of an earlier, simpler Christian faith struggling amid paganism, cruelty and barbarism in those brutish times, reminded me of and compared favorably to Bergman's similar explorations in The Virgin Spring and The Seventh Seal. Tarkovsky's film, however,is completely his own, presented in an elliptical and episodic structure, at times enigmatic, sometimes disjointed and loose, often poetic and fanciful.

Opening with a sequence unconnected to the remainder of the story, unless as a metaphor, yet wonderfully strange and evocative, the viewer will know right away that not everything in this film will be explained to him.  There may be no satisfactory explanation other than the stimulating visual ideas.  This can be both intriguing and maddening and that is Tarkovsky.

The film then follows the travels of some monk/artisans, eventually centering on the title character, Andrei Rublev, whose work is described by one of his envious companions as beautiful yet empty, missing something at its center.  This notion of unfullfillment in faith and belief and art and the social construct will run throughout the film.

The Christianity of these monk/artists is shown by turns as one of the few lights of charity and gentleness in a brutal and cruel age, and in the next instance as repressive and intolerant and narrow-minded, austere and indifferent to the natural life of humankind.  The struggle for faith and meaning, and to what use one is to put not only their faith but their talent and artistry in a world of atrbitrary power & indifferent injustice, of pagan bliss and casual barbarity, are central themes in the film.  In fact, faith and art are interchangeable in Tarkovsky's film, the struggle for meaning and purpose in art and how that fits in an, at times, monstrous world is the same as the struggle for meaning and purpose in religious faith, too often suppressed and overrun by the ambitions and passions of the secular world.  That artistry and spirituality are at the mercy of the crassness and indifference of power is startling demonstrated with the blinding of the artisans.

Tarkovsky doesn't shrink from the brutality of the era while showing us that ignorance and suppression have a long history in human history.  Amazing that he created such a film in the Soviet Union of the 1960's. This is a film with bold and shocking scenes alongside poetic and sublime passages.  Tarkovsky allows disruptions in his narrative and the insertion of scenes without explanation and this may be off-putting to some. But the overall effect of the piece makes it worthwhile. Suffice it to say that this long, yet entrancing film is rich with very different settings, scenes and ideas.

996356,5,6305257450,"Tarkovsky's Andre Rublev plows the same ground as Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ, but with greater success.  No, I haven't been smoking anything; I'm serious.  A collection of metaphorically related vignettes that loosely follows the life of Russia's great medieval artist, Andrei Rublev is about nothing less than the struggle between mankind's spiritual and carnal natures.  It is also one of the rare films featuring Christianity that neither belittles the faithful nor condescends to them.  I'll take this film over The Robe, The Greatest Story Ever Told or even Ben Hur any day of the week.
All the same, this film is not typical wholesome family entertainment of the Disney variety.  It's more like the cinematic equivalent of broccoli - you may or may not like the flavor, but it's good for you.  There is nudity.  There is violence.  If you're an animal lover, it may give you nightmares (at least two horses and one cow probably died in the process of filming).  But you know, the Bible itself is full of plenty of that kind of stuff.  What makes it palatable is the moral context - the material is in service of an authentically moving spiritual journey.  The film may not shy away from the ugliness of medieval Russian peasant life, but it also does not shy away from the message of redemption through grace - and I'm not referring to ""grace"" in an exclusively Christian context.
While grace wears Russian Orthodox garb in this film, the concept expands to occupy a more universal definition through the use of strong metaphorical imagery.  Grace, it seems to suggest, is a state of mind: if you believe it is a gift from God, this film will probably affirm your faith; if not, it will won't offend you with overt evangelism.
The beauty of Andre Rublev is that, like life itself, it places its world before you in all its wonder and horror, and then lets you decide what to make of it.  It strives to illuminate the human condition, rather than preach platitudes.
The best art has a way of doing that.
As for the DVD itself, Criterion has done a marvelous job of pulling together some rare documentary material, as well as enlisting the aid of Harvard film professor Vlada Petric in the creation of a somewhat dry, academic commentary track.  My one complaint is that the transfer, while supposedly made digitally from a pristine 35mm print, lacks sharpness.  It is also not anamorphic 16x9, which I consider an essential feature of any DVD of a film shot wider than 1.66:1.

The film tells the story of Russia's greatest icon painter Andrei Rublev, through episodes of different periods in his life. The film is very experimental, and molds philosophy, religion, art, and politics together for over 3 hours. Needless to say, this film is not for everyone.

996359,5,6305257450,"I believe Andrei Rublev will be seen as one of the greatest films of all time, if it is not already. It is not easy to sit through its 3hrs 25mins length, because it follows no sequential plot -- a-la-Hollywood blockbuster! It passes rather through several apparently unlinked episodes in Rublev's journey that ultimately gel both for us and him as he finds his proper role in life -- to uplift through painting of churches and icons.
From the outset there is a picture of medieval life in Russia -- though it could have been true of many European countries at that time (1400-1412) -- that is so realistic, so convincing and so shocking that one's grasp of that era is immediate and forever. One sees the stabilizing role then of religion, the horror of unchecked oppression, the miserable condition of the peasant, and also the humanity that emerges from total degradation and hopelesness. I couldn't help thinking how lucky we are today and how we really ought to better value and defend the good institutions and the many contributors to our modern societies. Much of what we see in Andrei Rublev is surely not unfamiliar to what people in many Third World countries have to bear in our own era.
Andrei Rublev is clearly a film so vast in its life view and so uncommercially put together that Hollywood could not conceive of it were it not already in existence. It would be pointless and immoral to copy such a real work of art. The realism of the characters, the story on every face, the fine acting that is beyond acting are not part of Hollywood's cinematic tool box. Directing this film must have been both a self-destructive and also uplifting experience on a par with Andrei Rublev's own artistic burdens. And I can only describe the exceptional camera work by saying that if the film were stopped at any moment, each image would be a masterpiece of still photography. The lighting, the contrast, the shapes and structures leave one breathless.
Need I add that I approve of this film and am grateful to Tarkosvky for putting it together under such unlikely Soviet circumstances. I first saw it 30 years ago and now again just last Friday. It has lost nothing of its impact and value to us all.",1038096000,13,2203,4.651282051282052

Like Dreyer's _Passion of Joan of Arc_, the film uses the conventions (and the enormous budget) of historical epic in order to tell a story which is quirky, personal, and contemporary -- in short, it's anti-epic. But it didn't conform to Soviet ideology, and it simply baffled American producers. Between the two superpowers, the film was cut by nearly a third.
Video and audio transfers are not great on this DVD, but they're adequate. For Soviet film of the '60s (especially one as mangled as this), that's quite an accomplishment. The extras are academic but not dry; film professor Vlada Petric's audio essay is especially good.

996450,5,6305257450,"Art critics consider Andrei Rublev, a monk who lived from 1360 to 1430 AD, to be the finest icon painter of Medieval Russia.  Both he and Theopanes the Greek (also depicted in the movie) are
categorized as members of the ""Moscow School"", distinguished
from prior schools within the Byzantine tradition by its humanism
Though few details are known about the historical Rublev, the film accurately portrays his environment: internecine warfare among princes, Tartar invasions, suffering peasants and a corrupt
Orthodox church.  The tension between this turbulent environment
and Rublev's optimistic nature spurs the protagonist along a path of spiritual evolution, during the course of which he deliberates
on humanity, evil, and the role of the artist.
Rublev begins as an outsider:  he does not take part of the common people's suffering and joy, or, at least, he does not get involved in ""the world"". Nonetheless, he is sympathetic to them, as evidenced in his conversation with Theophanes in the episode,""The Passion According to Andrei"".  Theophanes views mankind pessimistically and is more concerned with the ""Last Judgement"" than with worldly affairs. Rublev's opinion of people, especially the peasants, seems relatively optimistic and concerned with their plight.  This
is an important moment in the movie, setting the stage for
Rublev's spiritual tribulations:  Is man good or evil?  Should we
resist evil?  How is one to act in the world?
In later episodes, Rublev does participate in the world: carnal pleasure, violence, hope and disillusionment.  Having killed a man himself, he takes a vow of silence and stops painting.  He appears weary of the world.  However, he gains hope once more when he sees a young
man, Boriska, cast a bell for a village.  Despite all of the horror and wickedness, the villagers have seen, this work of art brings them happiness.  In the end, Rublev seems to conclude that
the act of creation can bring us moments of joy (and this rejoins the opening prologue where we see a peasant joyously flying a balloon) and it is the role of the artist to lift men out of their turmoil.  This revelation inspires Rublev to speak to Boriska, telling him to look at the happiness he has brought.  He then invites the bell maker to go to the Trinity Monastery with him where they will paint and make bells.
The film to this point has been shot in a dismal black and white.
However, the final scene, intended to underscore Rublev's revelation is a long sumptous color shot of the full image of Rublev's famous painting, ""The Three Angels of the Old Testament"".

And if you do stick with it until its final third or so, the rewards are bounteous.
Andrei Tarkovsky tells the story of the great 15th Century icon painter, Andrei Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn), in a series of vignettes.  The film opens with a famous scene of a man being dragged aloft by an escaping hot air balloon.  He soars overhead beckoning the people bellow to follow him, but they can't or don't.  Much of the rest of the film is taken up with Rublev's wanderings about Rus (old Russia) during a time of paganism, plague, poverty and marauding Tartars.  Rublev is so disturbed by what he sees and by one violent reaction of his own, that he retreats into silence and gives up his artistry.  But the final episode that he witnesses, which really makes the film, restores his faith and revives his desire to create art.
In this last story a young man, the son of a bell maker, convinces a noble's men that he can cast a great bell for them, that his father has handed down the secrets of the trade to him.  But as the work progresses the boy, Boriska, makes missteps and squabbles with the workmen who served his father.  At one point he is in desperate need of clay to fortify the mold for the bell, but can't find earth of the right consistency anywhere.  Then fate intervenes and, chasing a lost shoe, he slides down a hill into a muddy patch of just the right kind of clay.  Insisting that he be given a precise mix of precious metals, teetering on the edge of exhaustion, Boriska drives himself until the bell is done.  Amazingly, when freed from its mold it proves beautiful and the tone it produces rings true.  Only then does the boy reveal how truly miraculous it is that such beauty has arisen from the mud because his father died with the secrets unspoken and Boriska was actually learning as he went.  In the end he got by on little more than faith.  Rublev, who in this section as in most of the others is more a spectator than a player, goes to the boy and breaking his silence urges the boy to come with him and cast church bells while he, Rublev, will paint icons to adorn the walls.  In particular, Rublev has been asked by Abbott Nikon of Radonezh of the Holy Trinity Monastery in Moscow to paint an icon commemorating the prior abbot, St. Sergius of Radonezh.
All that has gone before is in black and white, but in the last images of the film Tarkovsky shows color details of Rublev's greatest work, the Icon of the Holy Trinity (1410), based on Genesis 18, when the Trinity is understood to have appeared to Abraham :
  1: And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
  2: And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door,
  and bowed himself toward the ground,
  3: And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
  4: Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
  5: And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant.
  And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
  6: And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes
  upon the hearth.
  7: And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
  8: And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree,
  and they did eat.
  9: And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
  10: And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. .
Obviously the director is telling us that the themes he has been exploring in Rublev's life, about which little is actually known, have come together in this magnificent artwork.  As always with Mr. Tarkovsky, it's difficult to impose precise meanings on his narrative, but some of the ideas we can trace include the idea that the artist, though he must get down in the muck and experience life, must at least in his art rise above and lead the rest if humanity.  The Trinity with its mysterious unity may also represent the necessary unifying of the various strata of the society that Rublev encountered--the wealthy nobles, the impoverished peasants, the churchmen who uneasily occupy the middle ground, perhaps even the Tartars.  The painting and the film are certainly both invitations to us to join with the Trinity in the unity of love that they offer.  On a more personal level the struggle of Boriska to create a bell on his own, without access to his father's wisdom, apparently represents Tarkovsky's own belief that each generation must discover artistic truths for itself.  On all these levels, and many more that I'm sure eluded me, the film communicates its fascinating and beautiful ideas to us, so long as we've the patience to let it unwind to the end.

996452,5,6305257450,"Andrei Tarkovsky was a man of excess...excessively self-preoccupied, excessively self-indulgent, and excessively brilliant. Andrei Rubalev is his masterpiece and it's a masterpiece of excess...long, slow and hypnotic.
The film was shot in black and white, except for the final footage of icons,  which is stunning. It is not, as might be supposed, actually based on a biography of Rubalev, not much information has comes down from that time period. Rather, each segment of the flim is a meditation on huge themes, Art, Sex, Belief, War, Doubt, and finally Redemption. As such, this is not a movie that you should watch as you watch other movies...for plot. Rather, the brilliance in the movie is in the images and textures...in the associations that Tarkovsky points out and in the symbols that burn into your brain.
Tarkovsky is a master of the unbelievably long shot. Some shots in his movies last for upwards of five minutes. Often, during these shots, nothing seems to happen. But if you pay close attention, the shots have their own inner motivations...they point out the symbols and have the appearance and function of dreams...watching Andrei Rubalev is like entering a vast slow dream. Once you get accustomed to the pace, it is haunting.
See this film, if you like the work of Bergman or Kurosawa. Tarkovsky ranks up there with this pantheon of filmmaking.",1031097600,,1365,5.039823008849558

In this one, the greatest Russian director since Eisenstein treats us to Ansel Adams type photos that move and lots of mist. There's also murdering Mongols who mercifully liven things up a bit.
I have a soft spot for Tarkovsky, even if all of his films have the same theme: The story of a director in love with his camera. What the hell, he's the the best answer to MTV.

996455,5,6305257450,"If you want to understand medieval Russia, this is a superb place to start. It is as if someone had gotten hold of a wayback machine and taken their cinematographer with them back to the 15th century. Andrei Tarkovski obviously owed some debts to Bergman and to Eisenstein, but he surpasses both masters in conveying medieval atmosphere. This is in part due to the fact that the film is highly accurate, historically. Tarkovski sticks to the primary texts in his depiction of Rublev, and his era. This is in no way meant to imply that the film is some sort of academic exercise, only that it falls within the boundaries of the great tradition of Russian realism.
 The film takes place in an era when the southern half of Russia was still occupied by Mongol invaders. It was only in Northern Russia that Christianity continued to flourish during this period. The status of artists was not clearly defined. Rublev and his fellow artists were regarded as prizes to be bartered for by the highest bidder amongst the noble boyars. Thus the graphic and violent scene depicting the blinding of a group of artisans leaving one boyar's principality without tacit permission to go to work for his brother in another province. It is a haunting scene, but accurately depicts a type of depotism that unfortunately recurs throughout Russian history.
  Andrei Rublev is considered by most experts (including James Billington in his marvelous book, The Icon and the Axe) to be the greatest icon-painter and muralist in Russian history. He painted his masterpiece, ""Old Testament Trinity,"" for the monks of the monastery of St Sergius in 1425. One can view some of his most glorious creations by visiting the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg and the National Museum (Tret'iakov) in Moscow. Icons still hold great importance to the believers in Russian Orthodox Catholicism. Visit any church service in Moscow or Saint Petersburg and you will see believers lighting candles and praying before various icons. To understand the essence of this faith and properly appreciate it's depth, view Tartovski's film and read Dr. Billington's books.
In all honesty, the film does require a bit of patience, as it runs over 200 minutes. For viewers disinterested in Russian history and culture, it may prove too taxing. For those who find Russian history fascinating and who wish to better understand the underpinnings of its culture, the time invested will be richly rewarded.",1023667200,6,2453,5.007352941176471
996456,5,6305257450,"This movie has everything.  The dialogue is intelligent, philosophical and even funny at times.  The structure of the narrative is very interesting and original.  Tarkvosky uses the camera to create beautiful shot compositions and ingenious camera movements.
Also this film presents a very interesting method of presenting a  ""biography"".  The viewer is never really shown any of the title character's art until the very end of the film.  The viewer is told 'how' Andrei Rublev became a historically significant icon painter rather than presenting his life 'after' his success began.
If you don't enjoy this film you have no appreciation for cinema.  That's sounds dramatic but it's true.  Within the first half an hour this film hypnotizes you and every few minutes Tarkovsky does something that takes your breath away.  Whether it's a line of clever dialogue or his beautiful photography of nature something will jump out at you.
If any film deserves five stars it's this one.",1019952000,2,978,5.139240506329114

I realize the film is from a different era, and about a different era and culture. Since there is an authentic feel
to some of the scenes, the film has value in capturing a way of life that has become extinct. And yes, some of the film is quite artfully done. But the reviews saying that this is one of the best movies ever made left me expecting a whole lot more. I was

996458,5,6305257450,"Andrei Rublev was one of Russia's most famous icon painters from the middle ages. The director Takovski is a fairly static director so that the film is hardly a fast paced film yet it is strangely affecting.
It gives a portrait of the horror of the medival world. A peasant who is a talented comic has his tongue but out because he will not become the jester of a nobleman. A land owner hires some craftsmen to build him a palace and then as they depart he has them blinded so that they cannot make anything as maginficent again.
In this cruel world lives the monk Rublev. Towards the end of the film he suffers from disallusion which prevents him from working. However he sees a young boy who is the son of a bell maker. The boy is able to cast a bell for a cathedral and Rublev is inspired to paint. The film is in black and white but in the end it shows his creative work in vibrant colour and one can appreciate his genius.
The film is a very long one and it is slow moving. However scene builds on scene and one leaves the cinema somehow impressed at one has seen. It is a film that sort of sneaks up on you.
The acting is good, the black and white photography superb and the sets and style of the film are fantastic.",1011225600,2,1222,4.160337552742616

996561,5,6305257450,"I have endured Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev twice now - once on VHS and once on DVD (the 205-minute Criterion Collection version) - and I have yet to penetrate its ultimate secret. The film is audacious and - as many, many will say/have said - epic without the added difficulty of being ponderous. It might simply be that Tarkovsky was a poet and not an intellectual. His work has been mischievously compared with Godard's or Antonioni's but is completely different. The latter two magnificent gentlemen invariably speak to your intellect. Tarkovsky speaks to your soul. Russian (Slavic) soulfulness is legendary, but Tarkovsky is not nostalgic; nor is his work particularly ""spiritual"" in the usual sense - i.e. moralistic. Andrei Rublev is 1 000 times better than any of Bergman's films and I like Bergman without reservation. To fathom the immense elan of this film one must suspend the expectation for significance imparted to cinema by 10 000 lesser films. Tarkovsky manages something that only the most sublime works of art can ""picture"" - a panorama of self projected upon world and a complex, associative magic that is irreducible to verbal or critical formulae. Please see this film, if ever you have lamented the porridge poured over our heads by would-be auteurs in the name of cinema. The central conceit of a half-historic, half-fictionalized Russian icon painter of the 15th century wandering about in search of life itself will more than compensate for the cruel gruel of most contemporary filmmaking.",1002844800,17,1513,5.104838709677419

The notes claim to have restored 40% of the dialog. The print that I watched must have been the one used for comparison. As I recall, the film print started off fairly well translated (or at least appeared that way), but as the film rolled on the translation became more sparse. Whole stretches of dialog summed up in one line. Eventually, the translation pretty much ended and I don't remember any translation at all in the last hour. A tip of the hat to Criterion for the new translation, and all the other work that went into producing this dvd. The film is so visually moving though, that you might want to watch it again without subtitles altogether. The magic of dvd.",1002672000,4,803,4.583333333333333
996563,4,6305257450,"Tarkovksy's films are not for everyone.  He is the Russian equivalent of Kubrick or Kurasawa or Welles, and he is as different from them as they are from each other.  If you're expecting a conventional structure and pacing, you'll be dissapointed.  Rublev requires patience.
Most people consider the film long and slow.  The trick is to stop waiting for the narrative to develop and just experience the sequences as self-contained ideas.  After a couple of hours you'll see it working up to something you hadn't thought possible at first.  And by the two-hundred minute mark, it evolves into a complete emotional and cinematic experience.
I'm serious.  It's amazing.  *This* is Tarkovsky's gift.
By his own admission he was always more fascinated with the ""poetry"" of images than their immediate narrative value.  As a result his films deliver an experience which is unique to every viewer.  This is no mean feat; today directors strive to make the global audience feel ""happy"" or ""sad"" according to a pre-defined and market-oriented narrative structure.  It's a  cheap manipulation (like ""Titanic"" and the damn theme music).
Tarkovksy doesn't go there at all.  He shows you something and lets you feel whatever you want.  This isn't a cheap cop-out from an inept director, it's *your* experience.  And a dangerous approach in a world where audiences expect to be cued when and how to react.  Have you ever noticed how upset people get when left to their own emotional devices?
Tarkovsky has mastered the long-take, mise-en-scene, and the wide-screen (2.35) frame, and the Critereon transfer does it's best to present this.  There are technical problems with the transfer, but having seen Rublev on a pan-and-scan VHS, the extra bucks are still worth it.  And the additional resolution of DVD gives the image more texture and detail.
Side Note:
One of the tragedies (now being slowly rectified thanks to DVD) of modern cinema is the pan-and-scan VHS.  Many lesser works can survive it (""Titanic"" again!), but it has ruined almost every one of Tarkovsky's films.  He composes very deliberate frames, balanced in a way that only wide-screen can accomodate (""The Sacrifice"" was the exception, shot 1.66 I believe).  The VHS transfers are claustrophobic and uncomfortable (showing only 60% of the image), but in their true aspect ratio his shots are spacious and carefully composed.
The accompanying materials (intervews and commentary) are interesting, but dryly presented by academics.  A shame, since this is the type of film that Martin Scorcese could do a fantastic commentary for.
And be warned, there are moments of horrific violence and cruelty.
Since the Reagan administration came to power, the west has lost track of Eastern European cinema.  It had (has) a style and direction as unique as the Japanese or British.  Tarkovsky is one of it's gems, and no one who considers themselves a conoseur of film can go without a Tarkorvsky viewing.
My personal favourites are ""Stalker"", ""My Name Is Ivan"", and ""The Sacrifice"", and of course ""Solaris"" -- unfortunately the only one I've seen in it's Wide Aspect is ""Sacrifice"".  But Tarkovsky is one of the greatest directors in history, and ""Andrei Rublev"" is still an amazing film.
Bye the way,
If you're not quite ready for the plunge into Tarkovsky, try the documentary ""Andrei Tarkovsky Directs"", which is an action packed account of the making of ""The Sacrifice"".",998006400,129,3416,5.078853046594982
996564,5,6305257450,"This film tells the story of a famous russian painter in the 15th century. It shows the brutality of medieval times such as raping, heathen orgies or the gruesome butchery of animals.
It was also a time were some crazy peasants tried to master the elements by flying into the air with a balloon only to crush into the ground. And after all it was a young hotshot who had the skills to create one piece of art: a bell made out of clay. Tarkovsky (along with writing collaborateur Andrei Machalkov-Konchalovsky, director of (among others) ""Tango & Cash"" !) shows all those cruelties with great realism (I don't want to know how many horses died during the shooting of the film) and it never turned out to be exploitative. The stunning images of this film will haunt you long after the final credits and for me it's hardly to believe that a film of such great humanity and spirit could have been done in a bureaucratic state in which censorship was quite normal.
The transfer is quite beautiful as you could expect it from Criterion. The movie is presented in a beautiful letterboxed format and in it's original director's cut with the exhausting running time of 205 (!) minutes.

996565,5,6305257450,"'Andrei Rublev' is one of the most beautiful and disturbing meditations upon faith I have ever witnessed. As a film it is consistently astonishing - so many of the images are unforgettable, the musical score is fragile and haunting, and the overall conception so inspiring that, personally speaking, it restored my faith in the power of film.  Along with Tarkovsky's other works, 'Rublev' is more akin to poetry than to simple narrative prose. Rather than approaching it as a regular film, I find it helpful to imagine that I'm about to enter an art gallery and view an exhibition by a master.  It repays repeated viewings, and it is not a film to hurry you along with the urgencies of plot - Tarkvovsky, as he often states in his writings, is concerned with  the nature and effect of time in the context of cinema - the pace then is contemplative.  There are few if any commercial considerations motivating the making of this film, so unsurprisingly it inhabits a world entirely alien to that of mainstream Hollywood.
*
The opening scene reveals a Russian Icarus attempting to 'fly'. His faith must overcome not only his own fear, but the wrath of others who find his ambition threatening. He escapes and we inhabit his point of view, one approximating that of God perhaps, Tarkovsky depicting the landscape and its people as something suddenly abstract. The frighteningly primitive hot air balloon inevitably fails, and as it hisses in its final resting place it appears as something organic, like some grotesque human organ proving its mortality.  The soundtrack throughtout this scene is particularly evocative.
*
 After this the monk, Andrei Rublev, is introduced and a series of events demonstrates and tests his faith in himself, in God, and in other human beings. Images of the worst cruelty and barbarism are juxtaposed with ideas of transcendent beauty - at one point the whitened interior of a pavillion is inexplicably filled with softly floating feathers and down (this looks likes snow, but the commentary tells otherwise); at another, a peasant village is drawn as if from a painting by Bruegel; a pagan ritual has torch fires flashing through a nocturnal forest. From these backgrounds emerge sounds that seem almost supernatural - the lone female voice that comes intermittently, her song like the most delicate filament imaginable, being the one that stays with me most.
*
The final scene is truly climactic. A boy, who is alone in the world, apparently leans on knowledge passed on from his father in order to fashion a magnificent bell for his ruler - in so doing he is risking his life, for he will be killed if the bell is not resonant. The construction of this bell is enthralling, the firing of the metal and the pouring, spectacular. Ultimately it is revealed, however, that the boy has not placed his faith in his father, but in himself, in his art, and, it is implied, in God.  Rublev comforts the child and this moment serves as an epiphany after which Rublev's faith in his own vocation is restored. The film erupts into colour at its close, as we are left with ravishing images of Orthodox iconography, Rublev's faith made incarnate.
*
If this film appeals, then it is easy to recommend Tarkovsky's other works, especially 'Nostalghia' and 'The Mirror'; Tarkovsky was also an admirer of the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer, and the latter's films are some of the very few that, for mine, equal Tarkovsky's achievement.
*
 The Criterion DVD has excellent picture quality and sound - better than the prints I've seen in theatres. If you have a widescreen TV the format can be optimised by setting for 'zoom' and adjusting the vertical pitch of the image until the black bar on the top of the screen disappears - the subtitles will then be fully visible below the frame. (Actually, I'd suggest trying to view the film with the subtitles turned off - particularly on a third or fourth viewing - for me, the visuals become all the more overwhelming.)",996883200,12,3972,4.822320117474303

Tarkovsky is a much more talented cinematographer than Goddard, but the film is basically a failed and pretentious attempt at ""art"".  It is brilliant at times (unlike most of Goddard's films), but somehow fails to coalesce into a satisfactory whole.  Give this one a pass and watch Nostalghia, a film that truly is Art in cinema.

The movie follows the artists and their work and travels and it provides a very interesting insight into Russian culture.  The movie takes place in the 15th Century and it shows Slavic Pagans, Tartar raiders, and the struggling Russian people.  In this film, the Russian people appear to be quite downtrodden, but we know that they are on the cusp of a long march to greatness.  The accuracy of the sets and costumes really brings the viewer to the time and place of the movie.  The villages, izbas, forts, birch forests and cathedrals all appear to be very real.  There is even large stacks of firewood which eloquently show what a struggle it was to keep warm in Russia during the winter.

The movie is divided into different sections which emphasize some moral dilemma of fallen man and the struggle of men to overcome that through Christianity.  The Christian concepts in the film aren't overwhelming in an American Protestant ""Jesustainment"" sense.  Instead they emphasize the struggle in the here and now between one's human needs and vices and the higher spiritual quest.

The movie moves at a Russian pace.  It isn't fast and the music is not overwhelming.  It is best described as excellent cinematography.  The first scene shows a man in a hot air balloon who is able to rise above the concerns of Earthly existence for a minute.  There is an excellent scene showing the Tartars raid Vladimir with the assistance of several Russian traitors.  The violence here is very Red Army.  Women are raped, a cow is burned alive, a hose is stabbed with a spear, and the Russians in the chapel are massacred.  The movie shows the Tartars beating the stout wooden chapel door and then the scene shifts to the Russians in the Church as the door breaks open to highlight the tension.

Indeed the movie is so thoughtful that I couldn't believe that the Soviet Union would allow such a film to be shown-and sure enough-it was banned for quite a while but it did get shown in Western Europe.  This is a truly maginificent work of art.  It is authentic, soulful, dark, and yet inspiring.  It's final scenes in color are a triumphant ending to this excellent film.",1426550400,2,2357,4.672330097087379
7885913,5,6305257450,"I would listen to any argument suggesting that Tarkovsky's ""Andrei Rublev"" is the greatest of all films. It is perhaps the greatest that art-house cinema has ever had to offer. It captures the viewer and puts them in a state of awe and wonder, that I have only experienced twice before: Once in Dreyer's ""Passion of Joan of Arc,'' and then Herzog's ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God."" It's on that level of greatness. It is dark but beautiful; exhausting but worth it in every way

The film is about a 15Th century Russian artist named Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsin). Set in medieval Russia, the film is divided into seven different chapters that spans twenty-four years. He struggles through great spiritual turbulence, and then awakening. He witnesses many atrocities being done onto people; mostly during a brutal Tarter raid where men, women, children and animals are tortured, raped and murdered. Andrei commits what he sees as a horrible sin when he kills a Tarter to save a young girl from being raped. He then loses his passion for art, becomes a Monk, and abstains from speaking for several years.

I was horrified by some of the images and sounds of this film. Seeing what human beings are capable of makes you question the nature of humanity. While watching the film, I wrote down in my notes ""why are we so cruel?"" But don't let these scenes be a deterrent from seeing this great film. Yes, they are hard to sit through; but you'll be glad you did once you get to the end.

The film's ending is about as beautiful as any I've seen: the screen turns from black & white to color to show us the beautiful paintings from the actual Andrei Rublev -- who was without a doubt a great artist. His paintings, and how the film presents them in the form of a montage will possibly move you to tears.
Here we see the work of a man who has been through spiritual and mental torture; and witnessed much physical torture of others---to the point where he does not even flinch when screams are heard. It was as if the entire film was one long breath, and the ending was an exhale of emotions.
The movie transfixed me, kept me in a state of awe and wonder. And then it softly let me in dreamlike fashion.

Films for me are similar to dreams. I've had countless throughout my life but only remember a small percentage; an even smaller percentage sticks with me -- and becomes a part of who I am as a person; ""Andrei Rublev"" is one of the very few films to which this applies.
