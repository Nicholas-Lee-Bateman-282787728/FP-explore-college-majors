1624669,5,B00005MEV6,"Ever since watching this Hemingway drama on TV in the 1980s I have been desperate to watch it again - it was never repeated on TV. I was delighted to see that I could purchase the DVD through Amazon. I have a multiregion DVD and I had absolutely no problem with the DVD - the quality is excellent.

Thanks for allowing me to enjoy the wonderful drama again.",1155254400,5,357,4.25
1624670,1,B00005MEV6,"I bought this DVD and returned it twice! Both discs are the same. Both are parts 1 and 2 of the series. While the labels on the discs are correct, disc 2 is not part 3 and extra features. It is parts 1 and 2 repeated again!",1124409600,8,223,3.765957446808511
1624671,1,B00005MEV6,"I saw this miniseries on European TV about 10 years ago; taped it and -- being a Pappa aficionado -- cherished it. My VHS copy slowly became fuzzy and I hoped to get the same in everlasting DVD quality.

Man, was I wrong.

The broadcasted series was longer. What did they take out? The good stuff. The broadcasted series had a brilliant score, based on the Enigma variations by James Elgar. The DVD has some electronic synthesizer score, usually associated with 3d rate porn from former Yugoslavia. The same goes for the title sequence; originally a piece of art based on watercolor freeze frames with design titles. On the DVD the titles are cheap digital fonts with a jagged edge.

Can it get any worse? Yes, it can. De picture quality of the DVD is more faded than my VHS copy. And something probably went wrong during transfer to digital format -- or it was deliberately done very, very, very cheap. All sweeping or action packed camera movements look like something taped from a narrow band internet connection.

If possible, I would have rated this minus 5 stars.

No matter how much you like Hemingway or the content of this miniseries: don't buy this junk.",1107648000,12,1164,4.658536585365853
1624672,5,B00005MEV6,"I previously had no reason to worry about who or how many women Hemingway might be married to.  Even Dorothy Parker was married a few times, and she wrote for `The New Yorker' when she was lucky, but she was unlucky enough to get married when husbands were going to war.  Dorothy Parker was most unpopular during World War II for complaining that by the time her husband came home, he was sure to be somebody else.  Hemingway never made it all seem as funny as Dorothy Parker usually was, but John Dos Passos was pretty funny when he said, ""Every time Hemingway writes a new book, he needs a new wife.""  If that seems strange to you, you definitely need to see this five hour feature on two DVD discs.  The four main female roles are all wives, and the young woman who has a major role in the final novel before THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA does not even get to be more than a companion on a sightseeing expedition in Italy (the book flopped).

Paris, Spain, Africa, Key West, Cuba, some mountain in the Alps; this DVD has great scenery and several wars.  There are also a lot of newspaper reporters, who sometimes get into arguments.  In Madrid during the Spanish Civil War the reporters called each others' stories propaganda, but the secret police who were arresting people on the streets might have been shooting them without having a secret military tribunal first, and the guy from Pravda who talked to Stalin on the phone every night never revealed what Stalin said.  Hemingway could usually get into arguments staying at home, or going out in his boat, or wanting to spend a few more hours in a bar before he went home for the night.

If you remember Liza Minelli teaching a little English to Marisa Berenson in the movie `Caberet' (I've been . . . How do they say it in German?), you should see Marisa Berenson dominating Hemingway as his second wife in this romp.  I am giving away too much plot:  there are so many women sitting around a table or hooking up with Gertrude Stein in Paris that you shouldn't expect a young married writer like Hemingway to start falling for them.  My favorite line is Hemingway telling her ""Rich girls know how to drive up the cost.""  Marisa Berenson plays a rich `Vogue' fashion writer, and if you watch this DVD expecting Hemingway to tell her that, it will help you figure out Hemingway, too.  Eventually you will not be disappointed.

Hemingway has to write what's true, but he wants his writing to make him happy.  Being happy as the most famous character on Key West gets pretty crazy.  With a movie this long, it seems that he lasted a long time before seeking psychiatric help and having a doctor tell him, ""Promise me you won't commit suicide if I let you go home.""

It is not unusual for authors whose books I enjoy to kill themselves, and some of the suspense is seeing how often it can be avoided before it happens.  The end of this, with Hemingway worrying in 1961 that he has kissed the Cuban flag and donated the Nobel Prize for literature to Cuba, shows how far a man with five concussions and a history of heavy drinking can sink.  In many of the movies that I like, the worst parts are the things that are true, and the end of this one is an expectation fulfilled.",1103760000,2,3219,4.422033898305084
1624673,5,B00005MEV6,"Stacy Keach, a near Hemingway look-a-like portrays Ernest the struggling author in Paris remarkably well. Life in Paris while deeply in love, without money with his career getting a start is arguably the best time in his life causing the appropriate book title of this period, ""Movable Feast"". Running through the streets with the bulls chasing him in Pamplona, Spain gives reality to ""The Sun Also Rises"", for which he made Pamplona famous. Flashbacks to the Civil Wars in Italy and Spain do a fine job of accounting for, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""A Farewell to Arms"".  Taking his second wife on Safari in Africa provides us a glimpse of his views on wildlife, nature and death. Touring Africa no doubt influenced ""Green Hills of Africa"" and ""Snows of Kilimanjaro"". Those fans of Hemingway that have visited his beautiful home in Key West, FL are familiar with the cats running around the property, his secluded den with the overworked typewriter across a bridge giving Ernest uninterrupted privacy while writing. The film quite accurately shows each of these aspects of his home. Hemingway's third wife, a war correspondent in her own right spent a long time with Ernest in Cuba where Marlin fishing influenced his great book, ""The Old Man and the Sea"" considered to have helped him win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. Hemingway's fourth wife whom he met in Paris loved him very much as we come to realize Ernest as every bit as macho as he is talented yet not indestructible. His weaknesses with alcohol and women affect his writing in later years. As the most prominent figure in Key West, FL he frequented the bars, which his loving wife tolerated. From Safaris, to Bullfights to Deep Sea Fishing to War Medals for Courage this Macho Man and talented writer when asked, responded:  ""Whatever success I have had has been through writing what I know about"".

7945291,4,B00005MEV6,"Having videotaped the original broadcast of HEMINGWAY back in the 80s, I've never had the need to watch the DVD version; so I can't comment on the edits, the transfer quality, the soundtrack, and the other technical aspects of the film.

I will say this: Stacy Keach (who looked like the young Hemingway) does a star turn in presenting ""Papa"" to us. Convincing and realistic, Keach carries this exhausting role off with panache.

This is a really big budget, complete and sympathetic miniseries that is well worth your time.

The only shortcomings in this five hour portrayal concern the episodic nature of the screenplay (a common flaw in lengthy biopics), and the fact that Hem's life is rather bowdlerized.

Papa drinks, he fights, he runs his mouth; but the darker side of Hem, his anti-Semitism, his racism in general, his adolescently inadequate hypermasculinity, his oft-pointless aggression and tendency to punch out almost anyone, his compulsive womanizing, and his blind-drunk binges are severely played down.

Hemingway was a gifted writer, spare of unnecessary literary excess and well able to draw a portrait in as few words as possible; but, talent aside, he was not a particularly nice man, and Keach's portrayal and/or the script tends to obscure that. Of course, as mentioned, this was originally a made-for-TV production, so the producers couldn't present a foul-mouthed lush into the typical American living room. Given the amazing amount of detail in HEMINGWAY, so much would have to be left on the cutting room floor in even a three hour big screen adaptation, that, warts and all, this is as good as it gets.",1284854400,,1630,5.022222222222222
7945292,4,B00005MEV6,"This production follows Hemingway's life fairly closely.  If you're familiar with Hemingway's short stories you'll recognize the source of many fictional scenes in this biopic.  The film was based on biography of Baker and the notes of Mary Hemingway, so the story favors her a bit, but it still gives a good idea of what Hemingway was like.",1259539200,,341,4.862068965517241
