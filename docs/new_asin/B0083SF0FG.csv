Downfall, i just wish season 9 was available in the box set.",1386547200,3,186,5.0
5125084,5,B0083SF0FG,"Awesome show!  This is one of my favorite scifi shows on television!  The first five seasons were excellent!  The storylines lagged in seasons 6 and 7 which culminated in the destruction of one of the worst big baddies in the series, the leviathan.  Season 8 redeems it all with the return of classic writers and storylines.  This is a great collection for Supernatural fans with fantatstic HD resolution and lots of extras.",1386201600,,424,4.833333333333333

5125171,5,B0083SF0FG,"Definitely worth the money, although it appears to be a bit more expensive than when I bought it a few years ago. (Talk about your late reviews, eh?)

The packaging is solid; the box isn't flimsy cardboard like you'd expect, and the individual season cases are made of flexible, but sturdy plastic. Playback was perfect, even on the smaller screen I had when I first bought it. I would recommend it to any avid fan of the series. Get this, then collect the rest of the seasons on individual Blu-ray. It's a much cheaper alternative, and you get more than you pay for, hands down.",1441411200,,579,4.514285714285714

5125201,5,B0083SF0FG,"Although seasons 6-114 are basically filler to me, they are all enjoyable! Besides, this set comes with the core 1-5, and for a reasonable - if slightly high - price. I recommend it to all hardcore SPN fans who have a ps3, or other blu-ray disk reader already at their disposal. Otherwise, just stick to the CW website.

Each season comes individually packaged in little dvd cases with up to about 4 or 5 disks each, all with their respective season artwork, as well as little instructional booklets on each episode. That in mind, if cases aren't your thing, all you'd have to do is toss the box, and you'd be set with the 8 dvd cases to go on your shelf. Box-wise, it's sturdy, almost plastic coated cardboard. I've had mine for about two years at this point and it has yet to see even a single blemish on any of the sides or corners. (To be fair, I am outlandishly careful with the thing). the box comes in two segments, a bottom topless cube which holds the dvd cases, and a top bottomless cube which slides over.

Video Quality wise, each episode is completely unaltered. These are the original voices of Sam and Dean - so no worries. The video picture quality is astounding.",1435622400,,1179,4.453703703703703

5125231,5,B0083SF0FG,"I live in Arizona and have a Samsung blu-ray/DVD player that I got in 2013. I also have a Samsung TV, also purchased in 2013.
The blu-ray set works perfectly with my TV and blu-ray player. I only had one problem where I was binge watching and had paused to get food and use the restroom...when I came back I could not see the screen anymore. I could hear the sound but the screen looked as if it was washed out. I turned it off and on and it still didn't work!
I figured that I had been there for hours and had my blu-ray player running for a couple days so I turned it off for about 5 minutes and I even tried reseting my TV. I turned it back on and everything was fine. I could see the picture again.
I'm not sure what happened...I probably just exhausted the thing! Other than that, I'm up to Season 8 and haven't had any problems with any of the other discs (my problem was with one of the discs from Seasons 3 but I think that was user error, not the disc).

5125315,5,B0083SF0FG,"Im a huge fan of the show!!
I've always wanted to collect the seasons, I saw this bundle & said to myself, ""it looks too good to be true""
I must have read over 22+ reviews before making my decision, on some of the reviews, it was commented that the disks weren't compatible with their blu ray player, & on some other reviews, it said the picture quality is not so good, I was still a bit hesitant, because they are manufactured in the UK, but they should play well in any up-to-date blu ray..

well I took a chance & purchased it anyway, the bundle set looks just like it is presented in the above descriptions, season 1,2,4,5,6,7,8 are in set of 4 discs, per season, except for season 3, it only brings 3 discs, the picture quality is not so great, but I think it depends on the quality of  Blu ray and your TV, Thers lot's of extras, deleted scenes, & commentaries, I got this set for $89.90, so roughly estimating it comes up to, $11.35 per season, wich is not bad for Blu ray..

Over all it is a great purchase for the price!!

5125345,4,B0083SF0FG,"First off, love the show, been watching it since day 1. Glad to hear season 11 has already been ordered by the network :D :D :D

On to the Blu-ray set...
Want to absolutely love my upgrade of the set (replaced my seasons 1-8 Standard DVDs)... but... having some slight dislike to the set so far...

1. Yes there are some new special Features with the BR set, but, they cut out some of the features that had been included with the Standard set... No more DVD eastereggs in season 1, no more image gallery - not sure what has been cut from the other seasons yet. Had I known they cut stuff out I wouldn't have sold my standard DVDs right away.

On the upside I really love the new interview segments for the Devil's road map feature in Season 1.

2. Image quality in season 1 - IS BAD, maybe it is just my player, maybe it is my TV, maybe it is the combination of the 2, I don't know. But so far every episode from season 1 I've watched the image is ""blown out"", super bright, no shadows, no medium tones. At first I though I was just imagining it but when I compared scenes from Wendigo to screen captures (from the original set) the difference was shocking. I checked episodes in season 8 and they didn't seem to be that bad. I've made adjustments to the BR player and to the TV and that didn't help, have never had that issue with any other show/movie I've played. So I'm not sure if it was just my set that is bad or if anyone else has had that problem???

The box itself only takes up about 1/3rd the shelf space the original boxes took, happy to get the extra shelf space. Can't wait for the season 9 set to be released.",1409961600,4,1624,4.142857142857143

5125360,5,B0083SF0FG,"Read a lot of reviews about how this wouldn't play in US(I live in US) players but blue ray wasn't specified so I gave it shot. The value of this box is incredible came down to less than $12 a season- awesome! I was concerned at first when it arrived because there's circle with the number 15 inside it on all the seasons/disks. I'm assuming this is a regional set of disks b/c I've never seen it before and it has UK info/ rating system on the back. That being said I was nervous putting it in my player and having it work but it did and the video/ sound quality is great. I don't know if the player itself is relevant but I have a WiFi enabled LG blue ray player. My only complaints about this are: I can't find how to turn on subtitles, I can't find how to turn off recap, there isn't an option to play episodes 1 at a time (each episode is 7 sections or whatever long) so if you aren't marathoning this you will have to find your episode. All in all my complaints are rather small for the value I got for these- especially considering I pre- ordered season 9 for half the price I paid for this set.",1409616000,5,1102,4.082949308755761

5125434,5,B0083SF0FG,"I didn't start watching Supernatural when it first aired. I kind of wish I did. But, since I got the Blu-ray discs, I'm quickly catching up!

I *love* this show. The humor sprinkled throughout, in between the drama and action, not to mention the very good looking leads, makes this a great show. It does get rather bloody, gory, and gross at times, (verging on Tarantino-like blood splashy-ness) but that was expected. They are killing monsters, after all.

I'm more of a Dean fan. I love Misha Collins' delivery as Castiel.

The music though out is good, too.

You can tell the writers have done some research into their monsters, demons, angels, world religions, etc (though I am certainly no authority) and their work shows. Their interpretation of hard-assed angels is a fitting one. Anyone who has read the Christian Bible would know that angels are not sweet, little, winged, pretty creatures, dancing and playing harps all day. They are God's warriors and messengers.

I did notice the effects in the second season were a bit cheesier than in the first, but in subsequent seasons, the quality of the effects has improved.

I've really enjoyed the gag reels and extras that have been included with the shows.

It seemed there was some concern that the discs would not work in some players. I have a Samsung BD-D6100C blu-ray player. It plays blu-rays and DVDs. I'm up to season six and all the discs have worked. I have noticed that they all don't work quite the same way. They'll start differently, the menus have been consistent throughout, but the discs seem to take different paths to get there. I did not take notes, so can't say exactly what the differences are.

Some of that is me. My first blu-ray player s*** itself, and I had to get another in the middle of season three. I'm kind of a techno-idjit.

If you've been watching it from the beginning, I'd say to buy the discs for the extras and gag reels. If you haven't ever watched it, but think you might like it, go for it. Worth every penny.

I've roared with laughter, gasped and practically jumped out of my chair at the surprises, nearly gagged at some of the very colorful gloppy gore, and squawked more than a few times.

I'm a Twilight fan and the show ""Live Free or Twi Hard"" just cracked me up. When Dean says, ""They're not vampires, they're douchbags,"" I almost died. It was hilarious. I mean, they even had actors that resembled Edward and Bella. It was great.

Then there were the other parts that were quite serious.

Ghost Facers! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha It reminded me so much of Ghost Hunters. You could call it a satire or parody of that show. The Ghost Facer characters are repeating characters.

Some of the shows are so damn campy you want to groan. Others, deadly serious and tragic. Overall, a great show! I've enjoyed them all.

Anyhow ... you could probably even have a drinking game where you take a shot every time Dean says ""son of a bitch"" or Bobby calls Sam and Dean or somebody ""idjits."" I expect there probably is a game for that anyway. I didn't Google it.

Just buy it.",1401926400,2,3067,4.539019963702359

The packaging is very thick cardboard...I was expecting something flimsy so this was a pleasant surprise.
But like others I'll probably store the box and keep the cases out for easier access.
The discs themselves are in the original hard shell cases which is another highlight.
A ton of extras for each season compliments the individual seasons.

5125470,2,B0083SF0FG,"I am very disappointed that the megahit records dvd set of Supernatural seasons 1 - 8 is of very poor processing quality that seems to be downright amateurish &/or incompetent.

Except for one or two episodes, all of the episodes on the discs in the set are viewable but all the discs in the entire set are totally screwed up re: the formatting for the disc menu & selection of episodes.

The disc menu with the episode selections is only formatted to display on one of the discs (usually the first &/or the last disc of the season).  For exam: disc 1 may show all the episode selections for discs 1 thru 4 but obviously I can only select an episode from the disc 1 that is actually in the player.  On the discs that do not show episode selections, I must watch episodes in their particular order or I must use fast forward to go to a particular episode.

In season 3 - disc 2: the episode A Supernatural Christmas was hardly viewable in the first minutes of the episode.  There was no sound & the picture stopped / started so fitfully that I had to fast forward thru the beginning minutes before the episode began to play as it should.

It seems the people who processed my dvd set were just in a great big hurry and did not care or bother to verify that the dvd's met any normal acceptable standards before sending them out.

This company would be better off raising their price if needed instead of sending out shoddy workmanship products.

Most of what I wanted to say is in the title, since that was what I was mostly concerned with when I picked these up, but it was so much less expensive to buy these than to get season passes, I took the chance. (I just started watching this show, so sorry, I can't really comment on the content, but I like Season One so far...)

The package is nice, I stored the box in my closet and put the season cases on my shelf for easier access, but it opens and closes easily, and is reasonably sturdy material.",1394841600,33,637,4.096

5125491,5,B0083SF0FG,I love the show and was really excited when I found the first 8 seasons in a box set that saved me on what I would've paid converting my first couple seasons to bluray and getting the rest I needed. They are a Uk release but they aren't regioned so that work great!. I use my PS3 and my friend tried it on his bluray player and it worked for both no problem. Highly recommended,1394496000,,377,4.04

5125494,5,B0083SF0FG,"I've watched this show from the beginning and have always loved it.  When I saw this set, I was very excited, although I worried it wouldn't play on my DVD players.  So with the reviews in mind that said they had no problems with the disks playing, I bought it.  I put the first disk in my computer Blu-Ray DVD player and to discover that they wouldn't play.  I don't know if it's just my computer or if the program for playing DVDs on my computer.  I was worried at that point.  I then put the first disk in my 3D Blu-Ray player I have on my TV, and they play just fine.  Now, I'm sitting back with a cup of coffee, nice and cozy, ready to have a Supernatural marathon!

Update!  It was my software.  I bought new software for my computer Blu-Ray player and it all now works like a charm.  Very happy!",1392854400,2,802,4.109677419354838
5125495,5,B0083SF0FG,This Product came as described. The price was awesome. The dvd's play fabulously. I love supernatural. Don't pass this up.,1392422400,,122,5.15
5125496,5,B0083SF0FG,"The bottom line to this series is: ""if you really loved the x-files"" and well you know the rest.  My wife and I did not get the chance to watch when it was on regular viewing, but I did not find one bad review.  This is really a great series and we loved show's that were paranormal in nature with theme's that were based in the Supernatural.  You have to give yourself a show or two so you can adjust to the characters and the pace of the writing.  The show has a rhythm and it is really easy to sit back and let the show take it's course.  The blu-ray is nicely done and we really liked the vintage rock theme, along with the 67 or 68 Chevy they use in the transportation portion.  I would recommend this purchase from the science fiction category as well as most entertainment for the dollar.  It truly is a winner.",1391817600,,818,4.139240506329114
5125517,5,B0083SF0FG,"I've been meaning to get some replacement DVDs for my collection since a disc or three have glitches in them and a couple of the cases are cracked or broken, and then I got a new, much larger tv last year and a blu-ray player a little before that. So. As soon as I saw this I had to get it, I did. My DVDs were nice but these have much sharper picture on my new tv, and it comes in a beautiful box with seasons one through eight. It's magnificent. It is a little pricey, but considering you're getting about 185 episode through eight seasons and each episode is almost an hour long? Definitely worth it.",1391212800,,603,4.162393162393163
5125518,5,B0083SF0FG,"I expected a cheap product for a cheap price because come on, each of the seasons themselves are around $60 each alone and all of seasons 1-8 at around $110? A little too good to be true --- is what I thought. To my surprise however, this is the real deal. I was a little nervous at the size of the box that it would have cheap paper covers but that's wrong too. Each of the seasons are in their own individual normal plastic blu-ray container and they are beautiful with the same covers as the standard tv seasons that you would buy individually.

The graphics are beautiful and well, hd. The only problem I had is the menu screen looks a little blurry, but that might be the way it was designed to look for art's sake and I have only looked at season 1 so far.

If you are nervous about buying this because you're from the U.S. and you're afraid this won't work on your player then fear not! I just got through testing my ps3 and it works perfectly. I don't have any other blu-ray players so I can't say for those, but it definitely works on my ps3.

So if you are hesitating on buying this because you think it's a cheap set then think again. I am so glad I bought this deal because it saved me a lot of money and a lot of time. It's brand new in perfect condition and it's just like the normal versions as far as everything goes except it's blu-ray. On top of that mine arrived a whole day earlier than the amount of time it said.

I would highly recommend this product for any supernatural fan!!",1391212800,93,1500,4.162068965517242

5125522,5,B0083SF0FG,This is my most prized possession. The price is a steal. Buying each season individually and only on a regular dvd is more expensive than this box set.

The packages came in perfectly in tact, except from the dented corner which I'm sure was from the shipping, but nevertheless was outstanding. All Seasons 1 through 8 were phenomenal and I was glad I was able to enjoy it in high definition on my 50 inch flat screen television. Supernatural is one of the series that I am surely going to enjoy and will declare it as my past time for my young adulthood.",1509840000,,546,4.20952380952381
