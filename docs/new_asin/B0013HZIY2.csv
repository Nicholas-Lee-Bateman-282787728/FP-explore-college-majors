Also I give BIG kudos to those who pull away from this toxic modern society and live simply. I will say (like one reviewer mentioned) it is a little lacking on the how. There's a lot of ""God lead me to do this and we listened""  which is great! But.......? Wish they would have gone a little more into the knitty gritty of it all. Beautiful families and lovely shots of farms ...Just wish they would have expounded a little bit more.",1392595200,2,524,4.458333333333333
8251028,5,B0013HZIY2,"This isn't intended to provide any training but rather to introduce the viewer to the Agrarian lifestyle. With this small hint to a beautiful life, makes one eager to follow as closely as possible. Thank you for such a wonderful film.",1364860800,,234,4.7317073170731705
8251029,5,B0013HZIY2,"I love this DVD because it is exactly what my family has experienced.  It is so hard to explain to the majority of Americans that there is more to life than a big house, fancy car, and shopping.  This movie is about a growing movement to get an understanding of what life is really about - a family united by faith that actually ENJOYS being together!  That provides a lasting happiness much longer than a good sale at any department store.  Being real people and not putting up heirs.  Grab a chicken and your muck boots for this one!",1338249600,4,535,4.363636363636363
8251030,5,B0013HZIY2,I so love this DVD and the information presented within it that I watch it over and over again. I always hear new things in it each time I watch it. Our family has started down a path of simplicity and this DVD has helped our children to understand what our dream is for our family.,1311033600,,282,4.053571428571429
8251031,3,B0013HZIY2,"I was expecting it to be kinda like a ""this is how we live the Agrarian life and this is why...."" but it's only the why and NOT the how. The family members (adults mainly) talk about how they came to live the Agrarian life and how it's brought them close to God. It just felt kinda empty. it didn't even seem like they spent enough time on each family.

It's only 44 min long and more time than needed spent on the narrator standing there talking. I was disappointed and am so glad that I didn't pay full price for it.

I'd say if they added the ""how"" and about 10 more min on each family it would have been worth the money. Oh well. I did learn some points and am grateful for that.",1300406400,5,683,4.014705882352941
8251032,5,B0013HZIY2,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD many times, even though my only call to farming is the raised bed garden in the backyard.

Quite a few families are featured, from a writer who moved his family on a few acres in the country, to third generation farmers, to families who moved to the country and have small farms.  One of the families featured is The West Ladies, who are so charming as they talk about being able to raise all the food they need for a year.

I will be sending this DVD to my daughter and grandchildren eventually as it reinforces so many of the values we hold dear... family, homeschooling, and eating healthy foods.  I know they will enjoy it even though they are not planning a move to a farm, either.

The featured music ""video"" on this DVD is ""Greenbeans in the Garden"" by the West Ladies.",1277769600,5,815,4.406666666666666
8251033,5,B0013HZIY2,"This was a great DVD.  They talked with a handful of Christian families who live off the land at various levels (some subsistence farms, one large agri-business).  I really appreciated seeing how people were willing to ""put it all on the line"".
Franklin Springs has a great reputation for producing quality, Christ honoring, family friendly documentary style projects.  I can't wait to get another of their film!",1227052800,2,412,5.119402985074627
