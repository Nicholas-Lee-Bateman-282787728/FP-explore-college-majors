5981557,5,B00FEMGCEC,"I have heard in concert this work over 18 times beginning with Toscannini and Ormandy with Monseratt Caballe, Pavoratti, etc at Saratoga and local excellent performances but this tops them all thanks to this young excellent conductor and his cast of soloists as well as the LA orchestra..BRAVO",1388620800,2,293,5.125
5981558,5,B00FEMGCEC,"At the traditional Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles conductor Gustavo Dudamel  performed the operatic Requiem by Giuseppe Verdi. Without baton he seems to be almost the musicians even closer. The Los Angeles Philharmonic follow him almost blind and the star cast of singers - including Vittorio Grigolo and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo - fits perfectly into the overall picture. In the bonus section of these DVD Dudamel explains his relationship with the Bowl and Verdi's Requiem. Overall, very well done. To be recommended.",1388361600,2,516,5.37037037037037
5981559,5,B00FEMGCEC,"Words cannot describe the excellent quality of this performance and of its recording technology. It is the most sublime rendition I have heard of the Requiem and I don't believe it will be surpassed for a very long time. Dudamel's sensitivity to the score and its underlying meaning is perfection. He has the ability to bring out the prodigious talents of the LA Master Chorale and complemented and emphasized the soloists performances. I was at this live Hollywood Bowl concert; it moved me so much I didn't sleep that night but kept reliving it. After the glitches on the part of the video crew, and there were many, I was amazed that they pulled off such a beautiful piece. I will never forget that night. Watching the bonus material of the rehearsal was indeed a bonus.",1387584000,4,773,4.6911764705882355
5981560,5,B00FEMGCEC,"Dudamel is in top form in this excellent new DVD, a great souvenir from an amazing evening at the Hollywood Bowl.",1387497600,3,113,4.428571428571429
5981561,2,B00FEMGCEC,"It seems like not a single soloist in this performance actually understand what they are singing, unfortunately, including conductor, who does not know what to do with the music if it is not furious and then he can show off his ""passion"".

Best part of the performance is the choir, therefore 2 stars, otherwise it would be just one.

Sound mix is terrible.",1387152000,4,357,4.650793650793651
5981562,5,B00FEMGCEC,A sensational performance at an intimate venue. Gustavo Dudamel's performance at Hollywood  Bowl is a remarkable interpretation of Verdi's Requiem. Without a batton he is creating something very special. I was attending the performance and have to say that the Blu-ray even exceeds the live experience. Strongly recommended.,1384819200,2,324,5.75
5981563,3,B00FEMGCEC,"I like Dudamel's interpretation and the singers are all in fine voice however the sound could be much better. It is uneven and comes thru muffled in parts especially when the chorus is being drowned out by the orchestra. I also did not like Vittorio Grigolo's over emoting during ""Ingemisco"". The Requiem may be operatic but it is not an opera and does not need the theatrics. Had the same problem with Angela Gheorghiu in another DVD version. In a piece like this the singers should not be calling attention to themselves.

This is an okay performance with well-known soloists who are vocally good. But it pales when compared to the Price/Cossotto/Pavarotti/Ghiaurov DVD conducted by Von Karajan. That is the epitome of Verdi Requiem performances.

I did like the behind the scenes insight from Duhamel but overall this DVD is only okay not great or even really good.",1407024000,4,868,4.858108108108108
5981564,3,B00FEMGCEC,"I just got done listening to/seeing this performance and I gotta say I was tempted to hit the fast forward button and push through a lot of it but I stuck with it and I have to say it's not a performance I'd ever go back to.  I even re-listen to a number of sections to be sure.
Let's be honest: the sound is not good.  It is clear, undistorted and bright but so equalized throughout that I found myself turning up the volume for the loud parts and turning it down for the soft parts.  Bursts like Rex tremendae and Sanctus are so leveled acoustically they just don't make much of the impact I would hope for.  I'm putting the blame for this on the sound engineering not on Masetro Dudamel who on second thought should have rung in on how his recording was engineered.
Let's face it except for Ildebrando D'Arcangelo who is completely in his element and does have the right voice for this music the rest of soloist are quite good to not acceptable. Julianna Di Giacomo has a lovely voice and brilliant top but is a bit over parted.  I found an exquisite except of her singing from Mendelssohn's Elijah on her website.  I hope she finds her way into lighter repertory rather than stripping her gears on heavy Verdi which she seems to be doing already.  At her best, and this is a compliment, she reminds me of the young Pilar Lorengar.  As for Vittorio Grigolo who sings with taste and sincerity I only wish he would learn the great Mozart roles.  In this performance he struggles mightily for volume which often fails him and seems quite relieved when the performance is over and he can unbutton his tux jacket and show how svelte he is.  Michelle DeYoung saddens me because it is a genuine voice of ample size who knows what the music is about.  I've heard her in person quite a few times but her technique, and not just in this performance, seems to fail her more often than not.  Wobbly and enough out of tune notes to complain about.
There are so many great performance with great conductors and soloist out there it worries me folks will hear this and think it's great when it's just ok.  So, buy at your own risk.  The other reviewers are clearly in ecstasy over this but I'm not.  If you must have have a video there's the older Karajan with Price, Cosotto, Pavarotti and Ghiarov; Bernstein with Arroyo and Domingo.  For recordings try Guilini, Solti, Reiner and even the old Ormandy recording is actually quite wonderful.  Or..  go ahead and invent a new standard that says this is great and enjoy it !!",1407024000,11,2511,4.4335511982570806
5981565,5,B00FEMGCEC,"For those distracted by the new screens and speakers at the `newly refurbished' Hollywood Bowl and for that reason elected not to attend the summer of 2013 performance of Verdi's operatic Requiem, this DVD is worth investigating. Courtesy of PBS who decided to air it for the public there likely will be more orders for the DVD as the performance now out of the headlines is solid and a fine evening for both conductor Gustavo Dudamel and his mighty forces.

The Hollywood Bowl ambience is captured rather well in this DVD as there are frequent shots of the stage form the top rows of the extensive Bowl benches: the Bowl is, we are informed in the added information to the performance the largest outdoor amphitheater for music in the United States. The natural acoustic this fabled site is now in the hands of acousticians and video manipulators so the old reverence of classical music in the outdoor evening is altered. But the new additions to the mechanics of the Bowl do offer the viewer some interesting views of the faces  (and bodies) of the conductor, the four soloists, the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. It makes for a nice viewing experience.

Dudamel elected to dispense with the baton and as a result his expressive hands are more available for molding the various moods and expressions the work requires. His overall concept is sound, architecturally correct, and given the fact that rehearsal time is limited for Hollywood Bowl performances, the result was a might and a touching Requiem Mass. The four soloists - bass baritone Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, tenor Vittorio Grigolo, Mezzo-soprano  Michelle DeYoung, and soprano Julianna Di Giacomo give fine interpretations to their parts, the LA Phil once again proves it is a World class ensemble, and the LA Master Chorale gleams. But it is that extended moment of silence as Dudamel stands motionless before his forces at the end of the work that makes this a truly memorable experience of Verdi's operatic religious work.

5981568,5,B00FEMGCEC,"I was fortunate to have been present for the August 13 performance at the Bowl.  Dudamel's interpretation swept me off my feet.  With the superb resources at his fingertips--the LA Philharmonic, the LA Master Chorale & 4 top-notch soloists--he brought out details of Verdi's score that I had not previously noticed while molding an over-arching unity in all the movements.  It felt more like a new composition than the Verdi warhorse it's reputed to be.  After the performance, I wondered if it was really as marvelous as I seemed to experience it.  The DVD confirms it for me.  And what's more, I can experience it over and over.  I agree with the other review that Dudamel displayed not flamboyance but a mature and measured approach.  It was really ""Verdi's"" Requiem.",1397520000,7,770,4.869230769230769
5981569,5,B00FEMGCEC,"I have always treasured Giulinis 1964 reading of Verdis Manzoni Requiem (with his dream team of soloists: Schwarzkopf  Ludwig  Gedda -- Ghiaurov) and perhaps used it as a subconscious blueprint when appreciating other performances, either live or recorded. On DVD, my favorite has been Abbados deeply felt and searing 2001 recording with the Berliner Philharmoniker, still in very good sound and more than respectable video. Maazels more recent interpretation with the Symphonica Toscanini (2007, see my review) I found disappointing. However, I know that great and complex scores can be performed in many different  and equally convincing  ways. Gustavo Dudamel impressed me with a stunning Dvorak New World symphony (Birthday Concert for Pope Benedict, DG DVD, 2007) and his new Mahler Eight (DG DVD, 2012), both attesting to his growing stature as an eminent musician.

The Messa da Requiem was recorded live in the Hollywood Bowl in August 2013. Against all expectations, the audio is very good, hardly blemished by outside noises, perhaps a bit dry and bass-shy for the lack of enclosed hall acoustics, as Mr. John Manning points out in his perceptive review. The video is excellent, too. The LA Philharmonic musicians play exceedingly well and rise to the occasion, as does the splendidly rehearsed Los Angeles Master Chorale. The almost all-Italian quartet of soloists is quite impressive: tenor Vittorio Grigolo shines particularly in the Ingemisco and the Hostias, mezzo Michelle DeYoung and bass Ildebrando DArcangelo carry the stage in the Lux aeterna and Libera me Domine, soprano Juliana DiGiacomo once more in the works final bars. Altogether one could not wish for better soloists with more pleasing voices, perfectly in tune with the orchestra and choir and with the conductors conception of the mass.

As to Maestro Dudamels conception, you should listen beforehand to the bonus interview, which is shot through with snippets from the rehearsals. Dudamel was thirty-two years old at the time of this Hollywood Bowl recording. In his remarks on the Missa, he stresses the operatic character of the work, its drama as well as its tender aspects. He conducts without baton, clearly trying to shape the human, choral and instrumental voices with his hands. Already the beginning sections (Requiem, Kyrie) set the tone for his intimate reading of the quiet sequences. Then, the Dies Irae explodes in high drama, the Sanctus is dazzling, festive and almost martial in the measured staccato passages, whereas the Agnus Dei is solemn, nearly humble. There is much operatic flavor in this performance, there are brilliant dramatic highpoints with plenty of fire, and, moreover, there is a pervasive aura of consolation that may be missing in other readings: a reassurance for the living that death can be regarded as peace and transition into eternal life. Dudamel does not obliterate the works undercurrent of irrevocable loss, pain, despair, and terror in the face of death. But he subdues or even transcends it through hope and  perhaps -- faith. This is a young mans Requiem, with the occasional smile, the surprising sudden ray of sunshine, and it leaves you, after the final note, not devastated but transported into a sphere of quiet reflection. Warmly recommended as an alternative reading to the prevailing performance tradition.",1394755200,3,3346,5.254681647940075
5981570,5,B00FEMGCEC,"This DVD captures Gustavo Dudamel conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a performance of Verdis Requiem Mass at the Hollywood Bowl on August 13th & 15th of 2013.  And I must day, I am darned envious of those people that got to see this performance live, as the recording is simply spectacular.

The performance features Juliana DiGiacomo (soprano), Michelle DeYoung (mezzo-soprano), Vittorio Grigolo (tenor), and Hdebrando DArchangelo (bass).  All of the soloists do an incredible job, but special mention must go to Michelle DeYoung for her captivating vocals and the sheer delight that is evident while she experiences the performances of her fellow soloists.  This is music making as a group, and the results are stunning.

And Gustavo Dudamel  my, oh my, is he fabulous.  He conducts the piece with his hands (as opposed to a baton), so as to be able to get his fingers into every part of the piece, as he explains in the Behind The Scenes interview extra.  It is obvious that he feels the music in a very special way, and in the extra you can see how he expresses this to the orchestra and how they respond.  The result is amazing music that is both operatic and symphonic  it quite simply doesnt get any better than this.  And the fire and brimstone of the Dies irae is as wonderful as the Requiem aeternam and Libera me sections that bring this work to a close.

If you are a Verdi lover or are a fan of Dudamel, then you absolutely must have this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  Very Highly Recommended!",1390694400,8,1518,4.657894736842105
5981571,5,B00FEMGCEC,"It's been said that Verdi's Requiem is simply an opera on a religious text, and Gustavo Dudamel seems to agree. Conducting from memory, he relishes the dynamic and emotional contrasts of the score, and if the choir nearly disappears in the tumult when the orchestra really cuts loose, well, that's the nature of the beast. The soloists play their roles, too, the soprano rather cool and regal until her ""Libera me,"" the tenor putting down his book to ham up the ""Ingemisco."" The chorus is fine, with some lovely soft singing (and good intonation in the treacherous a cappella sections), even if the sopranos are not together in their last fugal entrance. The camera work shows everything you could want to see, though the director misses a bet at the beginning of the ""Tuba mirum"" section: when the antiphonal brass begin their fanfares, the view cuts to the very back of the Bowl--only if you know what you're looking for can you spot the extra players (however, they are nicely spaced in the sound recording). Subtitles just appear when the text is first sung, and do not distract by appearing on each repetition.  As an extra, Dudamel is interviewed about the work and shown rehearsing it.",1390262400,5,1192,4.786407766990291
5981572,5,B00FEMGCEC,"Despite of the general remarks of Dudamel's interpretations being sometimes too flamboyant, his reading of the Verdi Requiem is truly mature and balanced. This spiritually elevated interpretation is a milestone in Dudamel's conducting career. Furthermore, the singer cast is fabulous; I do especially find the Master Chorale really powerful and precise. Nice addition for every Verdi Requiem enthusiast's collection!",1389744000,4,416,6.067796610169491

8614900,3,B00FEMGCEC,"Sorry guys and gals.  I've been dealing with this Requiem since, at 14, I stumbled into a recording of it by Russian singers.  As for tecordings, two reign supreme: the one with Caballe, Cosotto, Vickers, conducted by  Barbirolli; and the Price, Cossotto , Pavarotti--Von Karajan.  Dudamel hs not matured enough as a conductor to approach that level of excellence--and part of the problem lays in his choice of soloists, which lack the sheer vocal fireworks of the powehouse performers in other versions.  It's too early to grant Dudamel's version  five star status.

I sent back my TV CD and requested a sound CD of the Dudamel requiem and my refund amounted to $6.50 meaning I had to pay almost twice for the sound CD..... I cannot afford the TV-CD of the Dudamel version of the Hollywood bowl version of the Verdi Requiem.
