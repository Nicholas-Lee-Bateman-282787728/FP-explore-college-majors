8442568,4,B004V2FTZY,"Devendra (Sanjeev Kumar) is a writer who's women characters are moral-less, character-less, untruthful, betraying, etc, reflecting his opinion about women (after he being betrayed by a woman in real life). Incidentally, he comes across a nameless woman (Anamika played by Jaya Bahaduri) who has lost her memory and believes that Devendra is her husband. The entrance of Anamika into Devendra's life slowly changes his hatred for woman and gets attracted towards Anamika. Just when Devendra falls in love again, he discovers different things about Anamika's past; Anamika being a prostitute Kanchan, being wife Archana of another person, being daughter of a social worker.
Superb acting of Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bahaduri makes the movie watchable multiple times. The chemistry between them really works. Just watch the part when Devendra confronts Anamika for the first time in his bedroom. Their acting compliments each other as Devendra and Anamika go through different phases of emotion. A. K. Hangal, Helen, Asrani, Iftekhar, and Rajesh Behel have provided good support. Asrani's character Hanuman Singh is merely there to provide humor nothing else.
R. D. Burman has composed nice music for songs. ""Meri Bheegi Bheegi Si"" well sung by Kishore; ""Bahaon Mein Chale Aa"" by Lata;""Logon Na Maro Ise"" and ""Aaj Ki Raat"" both sung by Asha Bhonsle are evergreen songs. The background music is not very impressive; at times RD shows his brilliance such as when Devendra discovers for the first time that Anamika is married to another person.
Ragunath Jhallani's good direction makes sure that there is no usual Bollywood clich&eacute;s. He has handled the plot well, does not rushes through scenes and gives sufficient time for each character to develop. Interesting to see that the hero is not villain bashing, he is as human as the villain and overcomes the villain through his wit. The story at no point diverges from the main plot. Thus, the run time length of the movie is 2hr2mins (well below average length of Bollywood movies).
Now, is Anamika like the women characters of Devendra's novels? Will Devendra get betrayed again by a woman? What is the true identity and past of Anamika? To find answers to all these questions watch the wonderful movie Anamika.",1304899200,,2260,5.144021739130435
