1378116,4,B00004YS9A,"The beginning to this movie is quite bizzare.  You are introduced to the three main characters of the movie, and you are misled or make the wrong assumptions, about the relationship between these three characters.  It is actually quite cunning.  I'll let you find out for yourself.
The story is basicially a Chinese girl gets jilted by a Japanese boy.  Girl travels to Japan and tries to find boy, with a bit of *unwanted* help along the way.  It very quickly shows that there is more to the jilting than meets the eye, and that is not the only convolution in the story.
The story is comical, slightly dramatic and is full of novel action.  The shooting of the action itself is not only spectacular, but I find quite artistic.  Something I find strange is the music, which has a Latin flavour.  I liked it, it was cute, but considering the story has absolutly nothing to do with that part of the world, it seemed a bit out of place.
Ther wasn't much I didn't like about the movie, except perhaps the introduction of several character which really were not needed for the story at all (but add to the eye candy, so I am not complaining too much).
The DVD has pretty much the standard DVD features, language options, subtitle, scene selection, but was a bit scant on the extra features.
The English voice acting on the DVD was done well.  Although the story (obviously) remains the same, the translation and the context in the English audio version for most of the part is  different to the English subtitles and the Cantonese audio option.
This movie will appeal to most people, it's cheeky, action packed and keeps you thinking.",989020800,8,1628,4.582758620689655
1378117,2,B00004YS9A,"All in all, Tokyo Raiders isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't all that good, either.
The plot moves the movie along at a steady clip: a private investigator, a stood-up bride, and an interior decorator who happens to be a martial arts expert (!) all join forces in Tokyo, and fighting commences.  Along the way, the plot twists and turns around several fight scenes, and by the end of the movie, we realize nothing is as it seemed.  The movie is fairly well acted, although I'd recommend against the dubbed version (duh).
The problem is that Tokyo Raiders wasn't very well edited.  The fight scenes are great, including a particularly memorable one with a vaccuum cleaner, but all the clips seem to be missing just a little bit of the action; the cuts sometimes don't make sense, and you begin to feel like you're missing something.  Unfortunately, the movie seems to move that way itself, and you sometimes think that maybe a scene got cut here and there, because what's happening on screen doesn't necessarily make sense all the time.
It's fun, it's campy, but there are better HK films out there.  Rent it before you buy it.",987811200,3,1130,4.686868686868687

The acting is well done, and the cast well selected.  There is a terrific balance between the heroes and always a little bit of a question as to who is on what side.  My only complaint about the film is that there is not already a sequel.",983059200,2,466,4.535714285714286

1378120,4,B00004YS9A,"I found that this was a very entertaining movie. Filled with a lot of actions sequences and great actors, this film is a must for anyone. Here is the storyline: On the marriage day of Macy (Kelly Chan), her bridegroom Takahashi does not show up. Macy goes to Tokyo to search for him. She meets Tommy (Ekin Cheng), an interior designer who wants to collect debt from Takashashi, and Lenny (Tony Leung), a private eye who is hired by a ganster boss to spy on Takashashi. During the investigation, these three persons soon find that they are in conflict with the Japanese underworld Gang....

1378122,3,B00004YS9A,"`Tokyo Raiders' is not a great film, but is certainly very entertaining. Three handsome and sexy stars are all attractive, and the location of the modern city of Tokyo (where most of the film was shot) is another asset for the film, which lacks originality in the storyline.

The film starts with a bit comical fighting scene in Shinjuku, Tokyo, with Tony Leung and Japanese thugs in suits (one of them apparently ex-sumo wrestler) following him from behind. Leung's character Lin with affable smile fights back deftly using an umbrella and some 007-like gadgets in the well-choreographed sequences, shot in the street of Kabukicho, Shinjuku, one of the night life district in Tokyo. (Incidentally this place is very close to the hotel where Bill Murray's character stayed in `Lost in Translation.') The scenes are no Jackie Chan action, not intense as Jet Li, but still amusing in its own way.

Then we meet beautiful Macy (Kelly Chen, `Infernal Affair') in Las Vegas. She is waiting for her bridegroom (who is Japanese) who would not show up at the church. Impatient and dismayed, Macy flies to Japan, with a handsome guy from Hong Kong named Yung (Ekin Cheng), who claims that he needs his money back from Macy's fianc. In Tokyo, both of them soon get involved with a case of stolen secret information, CIA, yakuza, etc. Plenty of actions and a bit of romance ensue.

Actually, though the story constantly attempts to surprise us with twists and turns, it is not the most important part of the film, which is made virtually for the three stars Leung, Chen, and Cheng. These three likable players from Hong Kong, all charming and delightful, perfectly fit the light-heated mood of the film, where people fight fiercely, but not get killed, and even the yakuza (Japanese gangsters) look like gentlemen compared with the fearful gangsters in `Kill Bill Vol. 1.'

Among the actors from Japanese side, Toru Nakamura (`Purple Butterfly') would be the most famous, but his role is sadly a very small one. Equally small are the roles of cute Japanese idol turned actor Kumiko Endo and actor Hiroshi Abe with his trademark eccentric acting. That is simply disappointing for the Japanese viewers like me. Cecilia Cheung also appears briefly, and her role is not a big one either.

But with these three attractive leads, maybe we should not complain. The film is generic in its story, but is greatly helped by the presence of these actors, plus its good (if not great) action sequences and fast-paced direction, `Tokyo Raiders' is an amusing film, forgettable but fairly good entertainment for rainy day afternoon.",1151884800,,2606,4.913636363636364
1378123,3,B00004YS9A,"Making its stars look cool seems to be the main purpose of this film.  The plot is pure contrived nonsense: the CIA is somehow trying to devalue the Japanese yen through counterfeiting and working with a Japanese mobster; somehow, as part of this scheme, a CIA agent is assigned to marry a Hong Kong banker's daughter (in Las Vegas!); instead, the agent elopes with the Japanese mobster's wife and has a car accident in which the moster's wife dies; the CIA agent is hospitalized and he misses the wedding with the banker's daughter; the banker's daughter goes to Japan to look for him; the mobster, the CIA, and the Japanese secrete service then all try to use the banker's daughter to find the CIA agent, while the banker hires a kung-fu expert disguised as an interior decorator to protect his daughter. All of this convoluted plot is explained through about one minute of fast dialog.  I had to rewind and listen to the dialog twice to understand what was going on.  The MTV-style editing during the fight sequences is effective in hiding the stars' lack of kung-fu skills. This movie could have been great if only it had a more comprehensible and better developed plot.  The stars are pleasing to the eye and the action sequences are fun. Unfortunately, it degenerates into style without substance.",1133222400,,1303,4.777777777777778
1378124,3,B00004YS9A,"Depart from the popular Jackie Chan fare and take a look into popular Hong Kong kung fu cinema.  It's a silly tale of spies, lies, and lovers but not obnoxiously stupid as has been the trend for HK flicks of late.  Kelly Chen is Macy whose Japanese boyfriend is a no-show at their Vegas wedding.  She jets back to HK to find him but instead bumps heads with Yung, played by a perfectly coiffed Ekin Cheng, a smooth interior designer who has yet to be paid for fixing up their pad.  The two knock out some baddies, who just happen to show up at the house, and they end up in Japan, whereupon Lam, Tony Leung's shady private detective, proceeds to get all up into their business.  The rest of the plot is, how shall we say, confusing, and secondary; basically everyone's after Macy and the girl just wants to find her fiance.  Let's all admit that we're not really watching this movie for profound insight and agree that the narrative stays on track in it's own disjointed way, which means it doesn't always make sense.  The important thing is that every character is hiding something so no one really knows what's going on.
Despite big names and beautiful faces in this Lunar New Year production, the acting doesn't really stand out, except for Tony Leung Chiu-Wai's performance.  He continues to demonstrate why he's one of the best actors, ever.  Though he won't be grabbing anything at Cannes for this one, he ups the charm factor a few notches and plays the spy who I wished loved me.  Since the key word here is ""cool,"" the bland script matters less than sleek sets, suave spy fashion, and fluid fight sequences. All this movie asks of you is a handful of brain cells and the willingness to indulge in a nonsensical spy caper.",1065312000,,1730,4.516025641025641
1378125,5,B00004YS9A,"I am a big fan of Ekin Cheng, and this was an excellent movie, with a well developed plot and memorable characters.
Tony Leung stars as a Tokyo private investigator, trying to track down a gangland boss. Tagging along are Macy, (Kelly Chen) and John, (Ekin Cheng)a Kung Fu master, (who also happens to be an interior decorator, LOL).
Together, the trio tries to solve the mystery of Macy's missing fiance, but run into trouble from the CIA, rival gang lords and local police. A romance develops between Macy and John, and is exacerbated by distrust on both sides.
There are several great fight scenes. My favorite involved Ekin Chen and the vacuum cleaner, and the fight upon the car transport truck! This had a lot of really original material, and just enough romance to also appeal to female fans.
Great movie!! Where's the sequal?",1030147200,,833,4.751724137931035

Tony Leung stars as Lam, the toughest private eye in Tokyo. Despite his small stature and broken Japanese, he owns the Tokyo streets with his suave charisma and fighting skills. He falls in with Macy (Kelly Chan), who arrives in Tokyo chasing her  groom Takahashi. Follwing her is interior designer Yung (Ekin Cheng), who's after Takashi to settle a debt. Soon their paths cross and becomes a chaos.
comedy is allright, action is over the top, and characters are silly to the max. Tony Leung showed off his skills by doing most of his stunt. Too bad i cant say the same about HoNam...Kelly Chan looked great as usual, and Cecilia Cheung was just cute.

1378127,4,B00004YS9A,"Tokyo Raiders is a text book example of what Hong Kong cinema produces, and depending on your taste, it can be an eye candy  or annoyance. Hit or miss, it never stops trying to entertain you.
The story is basically about three Chinese in Japan, raising hell and spoiling the bad guys.  In between, there are fights, explosion, and of course, car chases. However, since pop stars Ekin Cheng and Kelly Chen needs to protect their squeaky clean image, there is no naked woman where one normally finds in an American production. But Tony Leung's large quantity of beautiful assistants do somewhat make up for it.
This film is all about gadgets, plot twist, and style.  With much emphasis on the later. It's rapid-fire MTVism editing even  outdone MTV itself. And probably needed to hide the fact that neither Leung nor Cheng knows any kung fu in real life.  But I like it.  The editing keeps the image flowing and makes a typical fight scene interesting...",1026777600,,952,4.704819277108434
1378128,2,B00004YS9A,"Remember when you met that ""special"" guy or girl who had the cutest, most adorable laugh?  But the more you heard it, the more annoying it got?  Well, the director of this movie ought to get a clue about things getting old fast.  He seems obsessed with trying to dazzle the viewer with switching between regular and slow-motion shots with no rhyme or reason, and making us seasick with weird camera angles.  Some great martial arts scenes are totally ruined because of his idiotic use of slow motion - it is insulting to the actors/actresses and the viewer.
On the positive(?) side, it is a hoot listening to the English dubbed dialog and comparing it to the English subtitles - the two almost never agree, and the differences are often quite funny - unintentional, I'm sure.  My wife was in the other room when I was watching this and she came in to see where all the bad dialog was coming from.
I feel sorry for the actors in this movie because their talents were kept hidden by a director who must have thought he was being artsy.
As for the plot, it seemed rather jumbled up to me.  I was so mad thinking about how the director ruined the movie that I had trouble paying attention to what was going on.  What could have been a movie with a passable plot but great martial arts work turned out a disaster.  I give it two stars only because the actors at least tried to do something despite being misdirected.",1016150400,,1411,4.420849420849421
1378129,3,B00004YS9A,"What we have here is a classic case of hype.  Some have billed this movie as classic example of what the Hong Kong film industry has to offer besides Jet Li and Jackie Chan.  This is simply not the case, because serious problems plague Tokyo Raiders.  The cast is not to blame here, as the acting and fight scenes are convincing. The problem is in the direction and editing.  Jingle Ma, the director, seems to try too hard at artistic flourishes -- slow motion is a big problem here.  It's added to every fight scene for no good reason, and it diminishes from Tony Leung's and Ekin Cheng's performance.  Sometimes, it gets downright irritating, and some sloppy camera angles don't help any.
If you can see past these flaws, Tokyo Raiders is actually a fun film, if you're a fan of the martial arts genre.  Essentially, it's an attempt to do a Hong Kong action film in Japan.  The action, besides Jingle Ma's addiction to two second slow motion shots, is interesting.  The use of the vacuum cleaner or Tony Leung's umbrella-as-weapon should have rivaled Jackie Chan's antics.  Yet, the bad camera directions makes it all moot.  What a shame.

7927609,3,B00004YS9A,"This movie is in Cantonese and some Japanese with English subtitles.  Story takes place in Japan, where a girlfriend from Hong Kong is looking for her Japanese boyfriend who was supposed to marry her in Las Vegas (USA), but never showed up.  He turns out to be a spy for the CIA sent to Japan to gather intelligence on a Japanese gang leader that the Japanese can't seem to collect enough evidence to put away.  Tony Leung Chiu-Wai plays a character who acted like he was a private investigator from Hong Kong, but is actually a Japanese government agent who was sent to uncover the disappearance of the CIA Japanese agent.  Unknown to the girlfriend, her wealthy father sends a body guard to protect his daughter, but he acted like he was the boyfriend's architect seeking his final payment for the new apartment the boyfriend had paid to built.

Overall, the film is action packed with fight scenes, but the story is a bit weak and confusing at first when none of the characters were established.  It wasn't until you reach the middle of the movie to know who was who in the story.  The movie tried to add some humor into the story, but it didn't quite work.
