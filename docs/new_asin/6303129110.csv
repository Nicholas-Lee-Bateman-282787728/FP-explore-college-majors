Vera Miles, Vincent Price and Martin Sheen are the guest stars of this episode.

In my opinion, the plot of this episode is somewhat weaker than those presented in the precedent episodes but the quality of the verbal duels between the characters saves LOVELY BUT LETHAL from oblivion. In particular, I liked a lot the scenes between Vera Miles and her young double Sian Barbara Allen, another victim of the nicotine.

A VHS to keep in your library.",1180396800,2,1285,7.855172413793103
7838696,5,6303129110,"In one word ""STUNNING""!  If you are a Vera Miles and Peter Falk fan this is a must, must, got-to-have movie.  The story line of a stunningly beautiful head of a cosmetic corporation called ""Beauty Mark, Inc., Vera Miles, is completely captivating in this role, YOU CANNOT TAKE YOU EYES OFF OF HER.  Peter Falk's seeming busybody absentminded detective work coupled with Vera Miles cold, vain and greedy need the a anti-wrinkle creme for dollars and the 2 murders that surround the plot make for a extremely interesting night at home with your partner and popcorn.  Buy it, you'll watch it over and over again.  It's one of Columbo's very best.",1037923200,3,643,4.756756756756757
7838697,5,6303129110,"Although many ""Columbo"" purists consider the Steven Spielberg-directed ""Murder by the Book"" to be the best of the shows, I find it hard not to place ""Lovely But Lethal"" about it.
This one shows the cut-throat world of women's cosmetics with a  knock-out performance by Vera Miles as Viveca Scott, a reigning diva who  will stop at nothing to maintain a dominant position in that industry.  She  is supported by a very young Martin Sheen as an employee whose greed - and  his relationship with Miles's character - becomes his undoing.  Sian  Barbara Allen plays a secretary with bribery on her mind.  And the late,  great Vincent Price is on hand in a small part as David Lang, one of  Scott's chief rival.  The brief scenes between Price and Miles are show  highlights because of their exchange of ""pleasantries.""
One  cannot praise the others without mentioning the man who for over thirty  years has brightened the small screen with his effective and entertaining  portrayal as the rumpled detective: Peter Falk.  He is the master of the  befuddled look, the ""Oh, by the way"" questioning, and the  resolution of the crime by some truly ingenious bit of deduction.
Yeah,  Columbo is only as smart as the scriptwriters. But Falk is such a joy to  watch!  This episode really lets him shine!
Now, honestly, could anyone  but Falk have played this character?  I think not!",957052800,25,1370,4.785407725321888
