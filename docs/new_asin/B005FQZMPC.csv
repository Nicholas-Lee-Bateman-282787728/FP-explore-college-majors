What's in the Bible Vol 6 - A Nation Divided.  Enough said.  Review over.

Really that is how I want to write this review because simply put, we love these DVD's.  We love what our children are learning about the Bible.  Even as adults, we love what we are learning about the Bible.  If you haven't started your library of the What's in the Bible Dvd's, you need to!

Okay... I will give you more details.

Volume six - A Nation Divided covers I,II Kings and I,II Chronicles.  These four books cover favorite stories like Elijah, Elisha, David, Saul, Jonathan...

The writers did an excellent job of covering the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of the story.  And we can all agree there are some really ugly things in the Bible!  Then there comes the difference between Elijah and Elisha.  I can never remember which did which!  To top all of that, the writers had to place the topics of sin, the many kings, splitting nation, and all of the prophets onto the level of a child.  Sure glad that I didn't have the job of writing the script!

Of course the fabulous Bentley Brothers along with the other characters have fun songs to help explain it all.  Sunday School Lady explains the hows and whys.  Pastor Paul breaks down the big words so we can all understand them.  There is even a song to help you remember the names of all of the kings.  I think this would be really cool to learn if I was a teenager again.  And into that sort of thing.

The point?  Another fabulous DVD by the folks at Jellyfish Labs.  Take the time to sit down with you kiddos to learn what the Bible is and the amazing grace and mercy of our God!

Thank you to What's in the Bible for allowing me to review this fabulous video.",1334102400,,1766,4.307926829268292
