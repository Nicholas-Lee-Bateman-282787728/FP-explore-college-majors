This opera has more ""talk"" in it than many others in the classical repertoire, and seeing it in close-up in the excellent studio setting really let me appreciate it fully. Both the singing and the acting were superlative (Gwyneth Jones in particular), and I was amazed that even with extreme close-ups there was scarcely any trace of lip-synching.

3092072,4,B0012L0TC0,"OK first a warning: you don't actually see anyone sing.  It's a recording with the singers lip-synching.

But you do get to see them act.  And they're utterly fantastic.  Especially Josef Greindl and Gustav Neidlinger, who owned the villian roles at Bayreuth during the 1950s and 60s.  At Bayreuth most of the audience can barely see the singers' faces.  Who knew they were such excellent closeup face-artists on top of everything else?  Either of them could have had a career in movies.  Neidlinger is sort of like Edward G. Robinson for German opera.  The same explosions of gleeful sadistic pleasure that invite you to join him in kicking the bigger opponent when he's down.  Infantile but also cunning and dangerous.",1226534400,5,720,4.925
3092073,5,B0012L0TC0,"I love Beethoven.  And I especially love ""Fidelio"".  But I also realize how hard it is to pull it off, and why it took the composer so long to finally get the opera to its final form.  The first act can be long and shapeless in the wrong hands thanks to the combination of spoken dialogue and music.  A strong director is required to make sure that things don't sag.  The same can be said of the music which requires a great conductor to maintain control and yet still provide exuberant fireworks but also supporting the singers' needs.  The singers themselves come across some of the most demanding music in opera, particularly the main soprano and tenor.  So severe is the music in its demands that rarely do any singers tackling the roles of Leonore (Fidelio) and Florestan ever sound effortless and truly at ease.
In this DVD we have not a live performance but a filmed one from 1970.  (It's too bad there isn't a complete live performance of the Vienna performances that same year w/ Leonard Bernstein; parts of the performance and the rehearsals were recorded, but since I am greedy I wish there were far more existing).  At first this distracts the viewer, as we see singers lip synching in different degrees of success.  The acting itself is at times rather stagey as well, but ultimately one gets used to these minor points, particularly with such a sympathetic a protagonist as Gwyneth Jones in the title role.  Her singing her is at her early best, just before she started having control problems.  She has strong rapport with Josef Greindl's wonderful Rocco.
James King is still under rated today.  We still read lots of ""yes, but"" qualifiers whenever critics write about his performances.  Here he too is at his very best: a truly lean, masculine sound with an even tone from top to bottom.  He and Jon Vickers practically owned this role for decades!
Gwyneth Jones and James King also make a truly believable couple, so important in this opera.  They have wonderful chemistry together.  When one thinks about it when did Miss Jones not have any chemistry with her colleagues?
The rest of the cast is vocally good, but in the visual medium with its cruel close ups rather below average--thanks mainly to the mature Marzelline and the older Jaquino.  And as someone else pointed this out Pizzaro (the great Gustav Neidlinger) hovers around almost like Count Dracula!  However the equally great Martti Talvela is luxury casting for Don Ferrando.
Karl Bohm is at the helm of the Deutschen Opera of Berlin and chorus.  I have several other recordings (on CD) of the maestro conducting this work, and this is probably his most successful balanced between conducting and consistent singing.  I cannot give higher praise than that.
Of the production itself...well, after suffering through the inanities of the recent staging from the Met (even the radiant Karita Mattila couldn't save that one), this one comes as a breath of fresh air.  True it is on the traditional side, (meaning that no stupid liberties are taken from the libretto) but that works with ""Fidelio"".
And for a film produced almost 40 years ago it holds up very well.  Maybe not HD, but heck I can live with it, particularly since it still looks so good for its age.  (Or maybe I am not as fussy).",1221436800,28,3270,4.72663139329806
3092074,5,B0012L0TC0,"I totally agree with the first review. I approached this Fidelio with some caution because it was a studio film and I didn't think you can get any emotional impact but I was wrong on that. The production looks like, or at least comes close to, the actual live performance. This is a beautiful production by any standard present or past and the camera work is outstanding. The closeups very effective. But it's the singing that counts and Karl Bohm's masterful conducting. It never surprises me to find the best performances when Bohm is involved. This is a powerful and passionate cast.
Gwyneth Jones is glorious. Her voice is huge and expressive and she always delivers a well acted and involved performance. The rest of the cast is equally as strong. Gustav Neidling, Josef Greindl, James King and the bigger than life Martti Talvela.",1219190400,32,836,4.8125
3092075,5,B0012L0TC0,"I have watched several different DVD productions of ""FIDELIO"" and have owned a couple but this 1970 performance is the GREATEST and most fulfilling which I have experienced!  I have had the great joy of being at several live performances at the Metropolitan Opera of this Beethoven masterpiece when Karl Bohm conducted.  He always builds his performances to achieve a fantastic climax where you really feel the great joy, courage and love of Leonore and Florestan...(hard to keep a dry eye).  Bohm drives the production without an intermission which allows you to feel the emotions without a break...genius!  The cast is top rate.  Bohm enjoys working with Jones, King, Talvela (he used them on the CD of this opera too).  You won't be disappointed.  This is another ""ode to Joy"" !!!",1213401600,27,783,4.931297709923665

8246723,5,B0012L0TC0,"This is, among all the Fidelios I've sampled on film, one of the best-if not THE best available.  It is even more engaging than the Met's  Mattila/Heppner version, from the same record label-a rendition of this opera I still have great respect for!  I won't spend any serious time breaking down the particulars of one performance vs. another (individual singers' strengths/weaknesses, staging, conducting, etc.), as that can make for a very long, drawn-out review, and really, my main focus here is just on this ONE performance.  We already know that one or two roles have arguably been better sung by this or that person, and others acted with more nuance by artists on competing versions, etc., etc.  Everyone with a few strong opinions on this subject has their own idea of what the ""Dream Team"" could ultimately be for Fidelio, and it's probably safe to say that such a lineup has, and will never exist on film-at least in the foreseeable future.

So..back to the Fidelio in this review.  I have to say, without reservation, that I LOVE this version, and probably always will.  For one thing, it's got Gwyneth Jones as Leonore.  Now it bears mentioning that Jones enjoyed a relatively short prime as a singer, and hearing her at her best requires that you aim for that 10 year sweet spot between the '60's and early '70's.  As luck would have it, this production catches her at her absolute vocal peak, and the rewards are absolutely stunning.  Beethoven's writing for the soprano voice can be quite punishing, and to be able to enjoy the all the colorful and exciting writing/composition that went into the music for the role, you can't be distracted by a singer who's struggling to make all the notes-even if she otherwise manages to pull off the bulk of the part.  Along comes Jones, who not only achieves this and more, but with such superhuman facility, that she makes it all seem almost easy.  In effect, the writing and the dramatic content come out front and center in the purest, most unforced manner possible, with singing that is full, powerful and rich, reminding us of just how inspired Beethoven's music for Leonore really is, when delivered by someone of Jones' amazing gifts.  The famous ""Abscheulicher"" aria is about as good as it gets!

James King is a very good Florestan, doing some of the best singing I've heard from him on recording.  His acting is also quite convincing, especially throughout the dungeon scene.  He may not make you feel the same amount of pathos as, say, a Kaufmann, but he is still very believable and sympathetic.  Gustav Neidlinger, is, of course, a powerful villain-absolutely unforgettable.  Really, all the singers are exceptional, down to the smaller parts.  I won't go through the entire rest of the cast at this point, but suffice to say, all do a great job.

The great conductor Karl Bohm takes a rather unique approach to the conducting of this opera.  It is not the thick and heavy style a lot of us might be used to from conductors like Klemperer (who I love), or similar guys behind the podium.  In fact, I was worried at first, that a slightly 'airier"" style might rob this piece of its gravitas and power.  But the fact is, it actually works very well!  The music breathes and flows in a way that reminds one of how Bohm conducts Mozart, or even Von Weber; a kind of music-making and 'Classical' phrasing that sharpens the musical lines and gives them a real 'lift', showcasing the brilliance of Beethoven's score throughout.

This of course, helps give the opera a kind of up-close intimacy, musically-speaking.  As well, this intimacy is even further highlighted by the cinematic style, and the general stage direction, emphasizing an 'up-close and personal' view of the characters and sets, as if you were right there in the room with them.  This approach makes for ideal filming of the production as a ""movie"", with sound stage sets and lighting, filters, direction, etc.-the whole works.  Of course, that means the characters lip-synch everything.  Some here, have definite reservations about such a practice, and find the results to be less than perfect.  But all in all, it is for me a small quibble, and not unduly distracting, especially if you're accustomed to seeing the same kind thing in other movies, musicals, music videos and the like.  That factor aside, all the cinematic techniques are really well done-especially the cross-fading that occurs during the famous quartet in the first act, where the individual characters' thoughts and fears are highlighted brilliantly in concert with the music and dramatic flow of this wonderful piece.

Fidelio, as we know, is a rather static opera, dramatically-speaking.  Any forward-momentum that this drama has depends largely on how it is being presented by the conductor, cast, and direction.  The brilliance of the music helps a lot-of course, but the rest is up to the forces involved in the production.  In the end, we can only go so far-do so much to make up that difference.  I believe this filmed production does an amazing job of just that, and more; and reminds us of why this work still matters so much in our world, even throughout the centuries since its debut.  Fidelio is a diamond in the rough, as far as operas go, but WHAT a diamond!  Check this production out, and see if you agree.",1486425600,3,5320,4.804395604395604

8246725,5,B0012L0TC0,"As an aside, so to speak, I fail to see the need for so many comments on lip-syncing in this movie version of the opera; it has been de rigueur in films almost since the advent of talkies (not to mention the offstage taps for Astaire and Rogers and many other illusions which the medium made possible). So far as I could tell, if you were not forewarned that it was being done, you could not tell from the film itself.
This past week, I have seen two other versions of Fidelio which I own, Bernstein's and Levine's, and, finally, this one. Each has its strengths and some minor weakness, all are, on the whole, superbly sung and well performed. Unlike many of the reviewers, I did not find the filming process preferable to the filmed live performance. Since all were, in fact, filmed...I have no idea why this appeared more artificial to me...but it did. Not at all unacceptable, it is well worth seeing and hearing...but, throughout, I had a sense of greater distancing from the action than in the others. Perhaps that was only me....but I offer it as a possible reaction for a few...or many...others....I just can't tell. Putting that aside, the central core of singers all sounded top of the line, their performances were admirable, the orchestra under Bohm strengthened all the singing, the sets pretty much standard for a production of the opera as were the costumes.
In sum, I can never tell what technical experts in singing and/or opera will say....I lack both...but for the average person who likes the look and the sound, whatever may be the technical appraisals, I should think this production will prove quite satisfying....even more, thrilling, given the quality of the score and the singers...but, so, too, will the two others I mention.",1450483200,,1752,4.766447368421052

Talvela manages to breathe life into the cardboard cutout role of the minister of the interior.  Niedlinger is slightly, but forgivably, over the top as the spectacularly villainous Pizarro.  The chorus does a great job with ""O welche Lust.""",1391644800,,551,5.134831460674158
