8068644,5,B0009WPLBC,"This goes alongside Birdemic tied for worst (best) movie I have ever seen. It is so badly made, it is hilarious. The soundtrack is this 20 loop of muzak that just plays and plays without regard to whether it tonally matches the happenings on screen. The plot makes no sense. They couldn't afford real slow motion so they just have the actors slowly pretend to kill each other. It's gone so wrong it has become a thing of beauty.",1506124800,,428,4.430379746835443
8068645,2,B0009WPLBC,They could have kept this in their personal home video collection. The only thing I liked was the lead actor James Black. Everything else was worthless.,1215043200,,152,4.884615384615385
8068646,1,B0009WPLBC,"Two words sum this whole movie up.

PURE TRASH!!!!",1199750400,,50,4.555555555555555
8068647,5,B0009WPLBC,"The A NIGHT TO DISMEMBER collection is a great deal if you're looking to pick up some indie-horror but don't want to shell out a lot of cash for something that might fall flat.

The mix of movies is really good. A good number of them do actually fall flat, but, except for LAST HOUSE ON HELL STREET, none of them are just plain old unwatchable. Outside of that film, though, they are all at least somewhat enjoyable and some actually cross the line into being good films.

So, for the number of films you get, and the fact that only one of them is garbage, this is a great deal and definitely something you should pick up if you are into indie-horror.",1193616000,5,651,4.284552845528455
8068648,3,B0009WPLBC,"Do you have a ""thing"" for rotting monsters, ghostly axe-murderers,  husband killers or Aleister Crowley?  Well, have I got a DVD set for YOU!

One of the movies in A NIGHT TO DISMEMBER answers the age-old question: ""Whatever happened to Tippi Hedren (from Hitchcock's 'THE BIRDS')?"" Why, she's been ""Searching for Haizmann."" And if Ron Howard hasn't heard from his kid brother recently, it's probably because Clint's been busy helping Tippi look. The shot-on-Super-8 flicks in this collection also feature a reincarnated child-killer, a crazed amnesiac and a serial killer and his female apprentice-- just the sort of folks you'd want as neighbors, if you were as demented as some of these 'Z' grade bombs are. Strictly for fans of gratuitous nudity, gore and general mayhem.

If you like the fright film genre, don't miss BRENTWOOD's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BLOOD-SOAKED-CINEMA-BITE-NIGHT/dp/B0009WPLC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BLOOD SOAKED CINEMA: BITE NIGHT</a>. Just another dozen bedtime gories sure to give you pleasant nightmares!

8068649,2,B0009WPLBC,"This movie is totally low budget.  It's not very scary, more like funny and gross.  And why after all the lead character goes through, does he STIll look as if is ready to go to a job interview at the end of the movie? I kinda enjoyed watching it!  I've seen worse.",1060560000,3,265,4.0576923076923075
8068650,1,B0009WPLBC,"bad acting, bad story, way bad special effects, poorly made all around.  can't believe this is being pawned off on unsuspecting customers!",1059696000,,138,5.2727272727272725
8068651,5,B0009WPLBC,"Oh my god. This is such an awful, awful movie. The good news is that it's so hilarious that I can garauntee it'll be more enjoyable than pretty much any other movie you'll watch.",1059091200,,178,4.264705882352941
8068652,4,B0009WPLBC,"Originally released as 'Ozone,' this is a low-budget horror film that's loaded with gooey effects and is more inventive and off-beat than the box art and new title 'Street Zombies' might lead you to believe.  A new street drug gradually transforms people into strange creatures and they develop into a sinister subculture.  Above par special effects, particularly at the climax, good acting, and an unusual story add up to a way above average low budgeter.",1056412800,2,456,5.066666666666666
