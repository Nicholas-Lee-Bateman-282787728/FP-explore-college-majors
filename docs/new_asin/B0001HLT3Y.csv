8012768,4,B0001HLT3Y,"I haven't actually seen this DVD yet.  I have several of the Elements CD/DVD comboinations which features Fortney's work on Deseert Light.  Desert Light has some incredible footage done by Fortney.  It features excerpts from EarthFlight, accompanied by Enya's On Your Shore, Symphony of Light which I think is now called Light Dance featuring Santana's music and Majestic National Parks, with relaxing classical music.  I've read other posts on similar items and many complain about the speed of the time lapsed filming and I do agree, to an extent,that it is a bit fast, but I still have found these DVDs to be nothing but relaxing and a welcomed break from some of the crap on cable TV.  I was about to admit myself to the funny farm until I fund these DVDs.  It's like taking a vacation in your own home.  After watching these I realized how tense I had become at just watching TV, especially the News.  I'm banking on this Timeless DVD to top the others he has out.",1090972800,6,969,4.593023255813954
