8194750,2,B000050ILJ,"Sole Venoms Lu Feng and Chiang Sheng are virtually unrecognizable here as the God of Chopsticks and the God of Bowls in a goofy straight-up typical hong knog supernatural kung fu comedy.  There is very little fighting to be had here.  This is clearly not the Venom type flick we're used to.  In fact, based on its substance, style, and sensibility, I personally would not consider it a Venom flick, and it is misleading to refer to it that way.  Let me give you an example... One of the Gods stands in the middle of a room.  He folds his arms in front of him.  He ""blinks"" his head (a la Bewitched), and he instantly disappears.  That's all you have to know.  As far the supernatural theme, this movie has it all...the hopping vampires, the goofy-eery soundtrack, demons dancing in choreography, tacky special effects.  The only fighting occurs between the two masters over the opening credits and in the final non-memorable showdown.  It's a shame.  When the box art emblazons ""The Venoms"" starring in the movie, and on the back of the box there's a small inset ""biographette"" about the Venoms, the movie, understandably, for an avid Venom fan, is impossible to turn down.",991008000,,1173,4.700980392156863
