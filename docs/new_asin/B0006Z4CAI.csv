2197615,3,B0006Z4CAI,Watched this when it was firdt on TV in 1985.  I decided to watch it again on Amazon Prime.  It is a good scare movie with it's share of cheese but Miles is pretty creepy.  Video and sound quality reminded me of a VHS tape that had been recorded over a 1000 times.,1381968000,,264,3.943396226415094
2197616,2,B0006Z4CAI,"CHILLER:

Miles is frozen and brought back to life 10 years later. He is cold and heartless. His own dog barks at him. Why? Because dogs are known to be ""soul detectors."" They can sniff out if a person has a soul or not. Apparently when you die and come back, your soul opts not to make the return trip. Having been frozen and thawed many times (first time was by accident) I can tell you that is not the case, although it is not good for the arthritis.

For some reason people without souls are stereotyped into the category of people with souls who behave badly, i.e. Peeping Toms have no soul.

The transfer quality of the film is very bad. Seriously, is this the best copy they had lying around? Even if it was a good copy, the film doesn't translate well into the 21st century. Pretty much a waste of time to watch it.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

MUTANT:

Brothers Josh (Wings Hauser) and Mike (Lee Montgomery) get stranded in a small southern town after a run-in with some locals on the highway. The town has been experiencing illness and disappearances. There is a biological/chemical facility nearby.

The mutants are not scary by modern standards. The opening credits has ""Special Guest Appearance by Jennifer Warren"" like they did for old TV shows. Indeed, this movie looks like it was made for TV down to the sound track, which may or may not have been better than the bad ""Tempe Video"" style I expected. The build up to the mutant scenes was better than the mutants themselves. I got bored at that point.

Fired lush Sheriff Bo Hopkins delivers comedy: ""Proof? I got proof. I got 86 proof."" That is about as good as it gets.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Fairly lame in adult material. I imagine the ""R"" rating is for the ""horror"" aspect.

This is a single, two-sided DVD.",1362096000,,1817,4.495440729483283

2197619,2,B0006Z4CAI,"After an endlessly extended revival sequence in Wes Craven's 1985 TV movie CHILLER, the dead man doesn't awake until 25 minutes into the story (an even longer wait if TV ads are factored in). During a board meeting, one actress clearly has more smudged mascara on her right eye, but exiting the room she appears to be wearing none at all. Only one of several continuity goofs in this tedious clunker.

The first victim of reanimated company CEO Miles is an older exec whose position is eliminated during that meeting, but the fellow croaks from nothing more nefarious than a staircase ascent and his bad heart.

Afterwards, Miles huddles by a roaring fire in an overheated room, unable to warm himself. The point being he was defrosted not only sans a soul but with ice cold blood in his veins, literally and figuratively. By this film's halfway point it's blatantly apparent that more than Miles' soul has gone AWOL: so has the viewer's interest in watching the rest of this tripe.

Paul Sorvino as the priest is wasted, but so is your time if you stay tuned until the end. ""Chiller"" is ultimately an unmitigated disappointment for Wes Craven fans.",1343433600,5,1149,4.735

2197621,4,B0006Z4CAI,"I enjoyed this horror flick.  I think that Paul Sorvino as the Priest who knows what is happening is very strong.

And Michael Beck playing a man with no soul does it VERY WELL.

He is creepy when he kills his dog-(who also knows what's going on) and creepy in his approach to the women and how he makes things happen.  He does sleazey really well.  I thought the mother was probably the weakest character--she plays blind so long--but when she realizes the truth, her strength comes to fore.  I enjoyed the overall darkness of this one.",1109116800,4,537,4.484536082474227
2197622,5,B0006Z4CAI,Simply terrifying.... thats really all you have to say... Scariest film I have ever seen in my life next to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs.... definently not a slasher movie... just a horror movie... a scary one!,1068076800,,217,4.589743589743589

2197626,2,B0006Z4CAI,"Interesting plot - cryogenically frozen man thaws after 10 years, sans soul.  Ah, the horrors of science!  I wanted to sit back and enjoy this film, Wes Craven being attached to the work, but the quality of this transfer is lacking in every possible way - fuzzy images, almost undecipherable dialogue, jumping frames, annoying color...19 minutes in I paused and removed it from my watchlist.  I don't know, it seems to me I've seen this movie before and didn't like it all that much even WITH a higher quality print.  Michael Beck's 'Creighton' is frozen in more ways than one - stiff, real stiff.  Totally unlikeable character with no redeeming qualities.  Predictable priest character, played by Paul Sorvino - horrified that Mrs. Creighton (Beatrice Straight) had her son frozen instead of just letting nature take its course a la God's way.  So many flaws in the script, continuity, character development, etc.  I would avoid this one, even if, or maybe because, you're a Wes Craven fan.",1418860800,,991,4.927710843373494
2197627,2,B0006Z4CAI,"It should be illegal to offer this! I have never seen a transfer this bad. And that's saying something. It appears they simply recorded a horribly bad VHS copy directly to DVD. I've purchased those $1 DVD's from Dollar Tree that looked better than this! I could actually see the tracking lines at the bottom of the screen, complete with audio/video dropouts, that people who remember VHS/Beta, will instantly recognize. Which is a shame, because I have fond memories from my teen years of this 1985 TV movie. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I do like the movie itself. It was so bad, I couldn't continue watching it, because it was nearly impossible in some sections to hear what the actors were saying. I highly suggest skipping purchasing this, unless you're feeling nostalgic for a bad copy VHS.",1399680000,,813,4.6923076923076925
2197628,4,B0006Z4CAI,"Very well done projection of one possible result of cryogenics not considered by modern science.  James Remar does a convincing job of the man who survived death to bring back something not anticipated!  Well done with very good acting, script, and portrayal of being frozen like a Popsicle!",1396051200,,291,5.041666666666667
2197629,1,B0006Z4CAI,"Do not buy this disc! This is not DVD video. I am really surprised that Amazon would sell this, since I have never received auch a low quality product when purchasing directly from Amazon. This looks and sounds like someone used a camcorder to record an old VHS tape while it played. It is completetely unwatchable and I recommend that Amazon stop offering it for sale.",1387929600,2,369,4.606060606060606

As THE QUALITY OF THIS DVD ISN'T EVEN ANYWHERE NEAR A REASONABLE STANDARD, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BURNT/ PRODUCED IN THE FIRST PLACE! IT'S AN INSULT TO WES CRAVEN & THE ENTIRE CAST!
I only gave it a star to allow me to write a review. My real rating is MINUS 5 STARS.
For a GOOD MOVIE to end up looking and sounding as if it's been dragged through a sewer is an absolute disgrace!",1386633600,,508,4.414893617021277
2197631,2,B0006Z4CAI,I saw this made for TV movie as a kid and liked it. It's an ok movie. The transfer is below average and so is the sound. It was barely watchable. I wouldn't waste too much money on this if I could help it.,1386547200,,205,3.6818181818181817
2197632,1,B0006Z4CAI,"The dialogue is out of synch with the mouth movement of the actors.  Totally unacceptable.  Will a decent copy of ""Chiller"" ever become available?  I thought this would be the one to end years of ""buy and error"" of DVDs that proved to be flawed one way or another.  I was wrong. The search continues.

2197633,1,B0006Z4CAI,"Saw this flick years ago in the late 80s in the VHS days and wanted to see it for the nostalgia. Seems nothing was done to upscale the quality of the film itself. Seems like they just copied the film from some VHS/Beta copy that was lying around, the audio is fuzzy and it even had the tape lines coming up vertically from time to time, they brought back the 80's all right.
Any ways the movie is Wes Craven's low budget cheesy style, watch it a few times and that's about it. Nothing memorable.",1382227200,3,495,4.221052631578948

8044052,3,B0006Z4CAI,"Thinking of being frozen and being thawed later, this movie studies one possible outcome. Not
really a scary movie , more science fiction.",1482192000,,138,5.043478260869565
8044053,1,B0006Z4CAI,"I watched this on Amazon prime.  The quality was horrible, it was blurry, and at one part I could hear a second recording it sounded like a tv sales show with The phone number so you could call in and order what they were selling, while the movie was still on. It hurt my eyes it was so bad. I just wanted it to end. I would give it no stars if that was possible.  Take my advice and do not bother with this movie it is a waste of time.",1474156800,,436,3.78021978021978

8044057,5,B0006Z4CAI,"Chiller is an interesting little horror thriller that was first shown on TV in the 1980's.  It's about people with life threatening fatal diseases who are frozen in a carefully controlled vault so that when a treatment is found for their disease they will be unfrozen and then cured of their disease. Thing start going badly wrong when one is unfrozen by a breakdown in the freezing equipment and is revived. The problems start at this point when he is revived but without a concience.  He is revived without any feeling towards family, friends, his Mother and sister and even no feelings towards his pet dog. He was frozen as a very loving friend and family member but is revived as an ice cold human being without feeling or any human emotion towards anyone.

8044060,2,B0006Z4CAI,A not uninteresting premise undone by a pallid script that loses its way after a promising opening.
