3527264,2,B001D7T44C,"I was previously familiar with the three films featured in the ""Warner Bros. and the Homefront Collection"". My reason for the purchase was to add a high quality DVD set that represented the Warners studio contract players during the height of the studio system. "" Thank your Lucky Stars"" {particularly Bette Davis singing her wartime lament, ""They're Either too Young or too Old"") and ""Hollywood Canteen"" were beautifully transferred to the DVD format. ""This is the Army"", the only movie in color, was a great disappointment. The picture was lacking in detail and the color was too brightly saturated and inaccurate. Surely,  Warners can do better.",1229817600,20,648,5.113207547169812
3527265,4,B001D7T44C,"Amazon have provided an excellent and precise review of this collection but here are a few additional comments:

 - ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" is a very funny film. If you like Eddie Cantor, then you will love the film. There are some really excellent acts. Ann Sheridan is sensational singing ""Love isn't Born, It's Made"", Bette Davis ""sells"" ""They're Either too Young or Too Old"" making up for her lack of vocal ability with a dry wit, Jack Carson and Alan Hale do a very entertaining vaudeville routine and the invaluable Ruth Donnelly is hilarious as a psychiatric nurse. Joan Leslie is a charming heroine and does a very clever imitation of Ida Lupino.  Watch out too for Alexis Smith's dancing. A trained dancer who was never given a chance in a musical, Smith is terrific and had to wait another 30 years before she could strut her stuff on Broadway in ""Follies"".
- At the the other end of the scale, ""Hollywood Canteen"", as Miss Leslie states in the commentary for ""This is the Army"", is embarassing. Bette Davis and John Garfield, who founded the Canteen, manage to maintain their dignity but with the exception of Jack Benny's hilarious violin routine, the acts are awful (wait until you see the Andrews Sisters) and the screenplay is dreadful. This is the film where Dane Clark faints because he realises the girl he is dancing with is, wait for it, Joan Crawford. The treatment of the stars with reverential awe is an insult to the intelligence, even back in 1944.
- ""This is the Army"" is directed by Michael Curtiz so it has a class which the other films lack. The technicolour shows a lot of bleeding and generally lacks the sparkle of the Fox films of the same period. The film is a reminder though of just what an excellent song and dance man George Murphy was.

As usual, Warners Night at the Movies are included with a choice selection of shorts, cartoons and theatrical trailers, chock full of patriotic fervour. ""This is the Army"" has a really outstanding commentary by Drew Casper. Casper has shelved his breathless repetitive delivery which have plagued so many of his commentaries to date and really does a good job here. The information is comprehensive and best of all, he is accompanied by Joan Leslie herself who has warm and vivid memories of all 3 films. Leslie is charming and Casper asks sensible simple questions  without cloying adoration. The other worthwhile extra is a documentary narrated by Stephen Spielberg no less about the contribution of Warner Brothers towards the war effort. Warners, in their usual fashion, lead the way when they made ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" in 1939.

There is a lot to enjoy in this DVD set but only if you suspend the all knowing cynicism of the 21st century - remember, it was war time. Beautifully packaged, the set is good value.",1229731200,4,2800,4.692464358452138

3527267,3,B001D7T44C,"REVIEW OF THE FORTHCOMING WARNER BROTHERS RELEASES = NOVEMBER 11th 2008

  HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN  and  THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS.
  Starring  JOAN LESLIE.

The good news from my favourite Hollywood movie studios: appeared on my web site this morning: WARNER BROTHERS are releasing Three of their finest War time productions onto DVD.

HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN made in 1944 was a superb moral boosting film made to cheer up both the troops serving in far away places, and also as a reassuring movie for the families at home that people in the film industries cared for their fellow countrymen worldwide in these dark days of World War 2.

I remember this film when it was first released: and queueing up for a few hours to get into see it my city cinema.

This escapism has remained in my mind for over 60 years... and I have rated it as my ultimate all time favourite film, and its followed by THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS which by coincidence is my second all time favourite.
The plot synopsis is very well engineered in its premise, and the two leading players in the movie Joan Leslie and Robert Hutton perform this short four day story admirably.

It beguines in the Pacific War torn theatre of operations, were a group
Of soldiers are watching an open air movie at night during a lull in bombing raids from Japanese Aircraft..... And they just happen to be watching a Hollywood musical starring Joan Leslie.
Robert Hutton and his friend !  another fantastic actor DANE CLARKE, are in the audience when all hell breaks loose during an attack Air Raid, which results in the two soldiers being casualties of War are shipped back to a Stateside hospital in Los Angeles.
Robert Hutton reminisces about his love of Joan Leslie to his colleague
Whilst they are convalescing, and pretty soon we see them getting a four day pass; which takes them into down-town Hollywood area.

After several hours of site seeing they eventually end up by chance, at the Hollywood Canteen.... a watering hole for armed servicemen of all nationalities, here we beguine to meet dozens of the Warner Brothers Stars
Who work voluntary shifts entertaining the visiting servicemen?
This is a fantastic array of talent... for older movie buffs.

Eventually as the story progresses: John Garfield another Hollywood great ably supported by the legendary BETTE DAVIS.... arrange for our film lead player, Robert Hutton, to meet his penultimate dream girl, Joan Leslie.
They go out on a couple of dates: and fall dynamically in love with one another....... until his time comes to return to his Army unit....

The closing scenes to this movie are embedded in my mind to this day as they kiss on the station: saying their goodbyes......I will always love you Joan Leslie, exclaims Robert Hutton.

Little did I know that I would live this moment in reality 55 years later in my life : but I did? When I visited Joan Leslie at her home in California on several occasions.

Through my work as a Photographic Journalist for the VARIETY CLUB of  GREAT BRITAIN
A Children's Charity.... I met up with Joan Leslie ( Caldwell ) in Los Angeles, and befriended her and her then husband Doctor Bill Caldwell.

We became very good friends and I subsequently visited her at her home in the Los Angels suburbs... on several occasions in the late 1990s.
We spent many hours talking about Miss Leslies fabulous career at Warner Brothers which stated in the late 1939 period... her movie big break came playing opposite Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino in the classic film.  HIGH SIERRA.... And  Joan became an overnight major Warner Brothers STAR.
  .
 She played again with Ida Lupino in another block-buster movie the HARD WAY.  Yet again a classic.

During the War years she appeared in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, with James Cagney,  Then she was cast in  RHAPSODY IN BLUE.... the biopic story of Legendary GEORGE GERSWIN.

THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS.....  was another superb made moral flag waver for the nation.

All of Warners highest actors where assembled for this STAR STUDDED  movie.
All doing there party pieces: this is a mind BLOWING experience watching this film.... I defy any single person who likes musical films to find a fault with this !
My only minor comment about this is that it should have been made in Technicolor: this is Dynamic Dazzling Entertainment at its best from beginning to its cavalcading finally two and a half hours of the greatest pleasure movies can throw at YOU.

I am THRILLED it's out on DVD and I urge everyone who loves good movies to see these TWO MOVIES.... if you don't like them ?  I will refund your money ! ! !

3527268,3,B001D7T44C,"Since Warners Bros. has the MGM package now why not put Thousands Cheer (1943) in this collection. This was MGM's wartime patriotic entry with most of their stars in it (Judy, Mickey, Lucille Ball, Ann Sothern, Red Skelton, Eleanor Powell) with a slim plot with Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson as the stars.",1218412800,8,306,4.7924528301886795
3527269,4,B001D7T44C,"These are three musical comedies from the WWII era. It's been some time since I've seen ""This is the Army"". I've seen the other two pretty recently. I intersperse the press releases with my own remarks.

This is the Army (1942)
Press release:
Irving Berlin showed his abiding love for his adopted country with, among other cultural accomplishments, decades of Broadway hits, the unofficial national anthem ""God Bless America"" and the World War II spirit-lifter This Is the Army. On stage it featured 350 real-life GIs, giving their singing-and- dancing all to raise nearly $2 million (then an astronomical sum) for Army Emergency Relief.
My remarks:
Irving Berlin actually sings in this one - and not too well. According to one story, after Berlin sang ""Oh How I Hate To Get Up In The Morning"", one stagehand was overheard saying to another, ""If the guy who wrote that could've heard how this guy just sang that song, he'd roll over in his grave."" I got this story from someone over at imdb, but I can believe it happened. Great music, but a rather weak storyline. However, you have to remember at this point it was early in the war and the outcome was yet unknown. With everything on the line, people needed this kind of escapist entertainment.

Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943)
Press Release:
Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, and Dinah Shore come out to play in the joyous World War II-era Thank Your Lucky Stars. A breezy, behind-the-Hollywood-scenes story about young talents hoping for a big break glitters with specialty numbers featuring Golden Era greats.
My remarks:
The best of the three films in the bunch, this film does something that nothing else on DVD does to my knowledge - gives us a large dose of Eddie Cantor. Eddie Cantor insists upon being chairman of the Cavalcade of Stars benefit show, in return for the use of his vocalist, Dinah Shore. Eddie keeps disrupting the show and insisting on doing things his way. To complicate matters, there is a certain cab driver who very closely resembles Eddie. In fact, he can't get hired as an actor because of the close resemblance. Eddie does a great job of playing both roles. Other stars performing in the film as themselves include Olivia De Havilland, John Garfield, Ida Lupino, Ann Sheridan, and Jack Carson.

Hollywood Canteen (1944)
The real Hollywood Canteen was the invention of John Garfield and Bette Davis. It was a place where the stars did not only the performing but also waited on the troops. This is a light romantic tale involving a couple of soldiers spending three nights at the Canteen before they must return to duty. As with the other movies, the main reason to watch is the great entertainment provided by the Warner stars.

3527280,4,B001D7T44C,"A trilogy of WW II films especially marketed for the folks left at home during those years but only one is a stand-out and that is Ronald Reagan starring in ""This Is The Army.""  The others are somewhat entertaining but there are better films out there that bring back the memories of a time in America when war was still hell but the home fires burned ever so brightly and respect was at its highest for our boys in uniform.  ""The Homefront Collection"" is well worth having if you are a collector of such memorabilia and even though the other two films are not quite up to standard...they are a slice of life which we will never again witness in our lifetime. I say go for it...you won't be disappointed.",1405987200,,704,4.407692307692308

In Thank Your Lucky Stars you will see some of the major acting talent of the 1940s out of their screen personas and I for one found them charming. Olivia de Havilland was not the ever noble Melanie Hamilton of  Gone with the Wind fame, rather along with Ida Lupino she gave the audience a song and dance. The clincher was John Garfields delivery of a surprisingly good rendition of Your Mother Done Told Me. For me the out of character performances these two stars alone is well worth the purchase.",1395705600,,578,4.601941747572815

3527286,5,B001D7T44C,"Back when we were the 'United' States these three films (among others) were produced to lift the spirits of a WWII war-weary US population.  'This Is the Army' (1943) is a color version of Irving Berlin's stage show that toured the world's military bases and raised a lot of money for the Army Emergency Relief fund.  It isn't really a 'star-studded' film in the mold of the other two films in this package because many of the musical numbers are performed by soldiers who had appeared in the various stage performances, including Irving Berlin  ... and contribute most of what is good about the film.  The other two extravaganzas in this group are in black and white but the 'color' is added by just about all the players under contract at Warner Brothers at the time.  Yes, the humor is rah-rah and dated, played out against the inevitable sadness of war.  The musical numbers are pop tunes of the WWII era. Compared to today's 'music' they absolutely sound like deathless classics.  The stories never gets in anyone's way but seeing all those stars doing their best for the war effort is a treat for anyone who was there (and remembers) and it may touch a few nerves.  Younger audiences might also get a kick out of seeing 'stars' they only know by name, poking fun at themselves and their screen personas. 'Hollywood Canteen' is part 'documentary' because it tells the purported story of how the Canteen came into existence as a place for service personnel to go for some R&R and rub shoulders with movie stars before going off to war and an unknown future.  Still, all-in-all this is an entertaining release.",1379548800,,1613,4.691489361702128
3527287,5,B001D7T44C,"For those of us who were born before WWII started these movies bring back the excitement of America for their military and show that Hollywood was sold out as well. Two of the three are 5+ star ---- Hollywood Canteen and This is the Army. The other one is 3 star.

We need the song ""You can always tell a Yank"" sung by Dennis Morgan and Joe E. Brown in the movie ""Hollywood Canteen"" brought back to liven Americans for America. We are being led down hill by the Vietnam War haters who also hate our military and Founding Fathers. Americans in WWII were always for our Military and it took 400,000 deaths over the 4 years to show that many who were drafted or signed up were willing to give their lives for America and  the citizens and not declare themselves to be free of that as many did in the Vietnam War days. Hollywood has gone down, down, down because of their hate also.

The other 5+star movie is my favorite. ""This is the Army"", but with Ronald Reagan one of the stars you know what this present Hollywood would say and the present Washington leaders. The class scene is when Kate Smith sings for the first time in a movie, ""God bless America"". Now you can't even say that in schools or the ACLU (founded by a Communist in 1919) will nail you. A great scene that occurred during Miss Smith's singing (done in 1943) shows George Murphy and Ronald Reagan. Murphy becomes a US senator from CA in the 60s and of course Reagan is Governor of CA then and later President in 1980 and 1984. Both stars backed our military 100%. Reagan was a Lt. in WWII. Too many in Washington today never served in our Armed Forces and are sold out to the right (always ACLU defended) to not serve. Young guys today have no idea what it means to serve their country for the protection of our Citizens or are completely lost by the meaning of ""God Bless America"". Now you know why America is so split today. Back then the focus was prayer in the Military in the Name of God and Jesus. Every soldier was given a Bible. Now you can't even mention it.

3527300,5,B001D7T44C,"Wow. This collection is a virtual museum of mid-World War Two entertainment. Warner Bros. did an excellent job of recreating something of what it would have been like to see these films in the theatre, and it's a must-see for anyone who is interested in the time period. Or, for that matter, anyone who enjoys the work of Joan Leslie, who is in all three films and is her usual sweetheart self.

""This Is the Army"" features stellar music by Irving Berlin. I actually have sung the title song to my son, and even when he was a baby he thought it was extremely funny. The key phrase when thinking of ""Army"" is ""PERIOD PIECE."" There's a minstral show (it was okay back then, though today's audiences may squirm), there are lots of guys in drag (go with it), and there are plenty of antics, such as someone throwing a shoe at a bugler. Ronald Reagan is basically the stage manager of the second Army show, and it's fun to see him at the beginning of his career.

""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" is jaw-dropping. Bette Davis and John Garfield sing, Errol Flynn dances, and Eddie Cantor is everywhere. Yipes. I asked my mom about this guy--my parents were both born at the beginning of World War Two--and she told me Eddie Cantor did burlesque and vaudeville, so his performance style was pretty explosive. Darned right. All I know is I never saw anyone move their eyes like that before.

""Hollywood Canteen"" may be the best of the three. When I first saw this film on Turner Classic Movies, I wanted to eat it up with a spoon. Like ""Stage Door Canteen,"" it features a wall-to-wall Who's Who of 1940s pop culture, and it's done brilliantly. Some of the highlights are performances by the Andrews Sisters, Dane Clark's animal magnetism, and a touch of romance with Robert Hutton and Joan Leslie. I would say more, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone.

Me?  I'm happy with WHV's efforts, even if these efforts are not the norm.  Granted, they should fess up and admit what it took to bring this title to DVD.  But in the end, we still have the best offering of this movie that we have ever had for the DVD format.  Who cares if it has been tweeked and computer enhanced.  What DVD isn't anymore?  There is no such thing as purity in celuloid anymore.

I plan to watch this WHV release again and again.  Thanks, Warner for doing your best.",1237334400,2,1071,4.311557788944723
3527307,4,B001D7T44C,"There has been complaints that the newly restored ""Irving Berlin's: This Is The Army"" currently only available in the Warner Homefront Collection, isn't up to their usual quality.  First, a little background is in order...

This is Warner's very first use of the 3-strip Technicolor process for a musical.  Color stock was hard to get and discouraged during WWII.  The film was made solely for the purpose of raising funds for the war effort and in 1950, the studio gave the film over to Army Emergency Relief then it fell into public domain in the 1970s.  Original negative elements are most likely lost forever.

In 1991 the cable movie network AMC along with UCLA Film and Television Archive did a restoration of the film but the results ended up not so well with flickering and color shifts.  All other copies available were so faded that they had a sepia tone color to them and it was one of these that Warner obviously worked from.  The ""saturation"" of colors upon close inspection on a 1080p television shows that the film was ""colorized"" and there are times with details where you have glow and odd color edge enhancements due to register shifts giving a 3-D effect (without the glasses) on some background objects and people.  Take a look at the mass of soldiers in one skit.. all of the faces are exactly identical in color and look like they cut and pasted 300 copies onto the frame.  The only skit that looked fairly natural was the Harlem number where the African Americans skin tones were varied because they didn't have to colorize the sepia for their faces and uniforms like with the pinkish white actor faces.  Grass, shrubs, clothing, even eye colors and hair all look ""solid"" and pop out unnaturally at times from the overlay of color and of course metal tones were off.

All said, this is the best this film will look unless they find the original 3 strip negative elements and being such a specialized movie doubt it will be revisited.  Warner should have made this known up front of the movie but the only disclaimers were the P.C. ones but did give us more extras on this disc than the others as an apology of sorts.  Watch this movie with an open mind that it looks colorized and then enjoy.

3527308,5,B001D7T44C,"Briefly issued individually,Warners has brought together three war time classic musicals and put them into one set called ""Warner Brothers and the Homefront Collection"";""This is The Army"",""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" and ""Hollywood Canteen"".And you can thank your lucky stars too,as these movies belong in everyone's collections.
""This is the Army"",my favourite among the three,raised more than nine million dollars for the Army Emergency relief fund in its' day,while its' stage counterpart of the previous year raised around a cool two million. One heck of a take and with good reason. Irving Berlin's original shows ""Yip,Yip Yaphank"" back in WW1 and ""This is the Army"" for WW2 were extraordinarily successful because they struck a chord not only with servicemen but for the families of servicemen also. Both sides of the ""fence"" so to speak, could relate to the material being performed before their appreciative eyes. Thus the movie,an amalgam of both Berlin show's, brings that same spirit to the screen and audiences ate every patriotic moment of it up,showing their appreciation at the box office in spades. The story revolves around George Murphy,a dancer by profession, who puts on ""Yip,Yip Yaphank"" during WW1. When the show ends for the cast the troupe all march off to war. Murphy comes home with an injured leg and is unable to dance again. When WW2 rears its ugly head Murphy gets the idea of putting on another show for the boys but with an updated theme. By this time his son,played by Ronald Reagan,is also in the service and agrees to help his father out. Ron has a girl but refuses to marry her saying that he wants to get the war out of the way first. It's a back and forth tug until eventually Ronald relents later in the film. In the meantime the show goes on with a special number inserted for the original cast members of ""Yip,Yip Yaphank"",but the members blind side George who is watching from the audience. During the number,which is a close army""drill"",he is called by name and rank to go onstage and take over. It's a tender moment for Murphy's character and for us. Near the end of the show legendary Irving Berlin takes to the stage himself to sing""How I hate to get up in the Morning"".It's an unforgettable moment in motion picture history.
Through the entire picture we are entertained by some of the best Warner Brothers/First National could muster like Kate Smith doing her penultimate song""God Bless America"",Alan Hale(real life father of Alan Hale Jr.,skipper from Gilligan's Island),George Tobias,Joan Leslie,Charles Butterworth,Sgt. Joe Louis(now enlisted boxing champion)and many more all backed by over 300 actual GIs. As I say it is my favourite of the three and it still stirs the soul whenever I watch it. The DVD includes ""Warner at War"",a new documentary narrated by Steven Spielberg,added commentary by Joan Leslie and Dr Drew Casper,a (deleted from American prints)scene for British audiences,the original overture and exit music re-inserted,a vintage newsreel,cartoon,a musical short and trailers.
""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" involves the story of two producers SZ Sakall(one of my favourite all time character actors) and the incomparable Edward Everett Horton wanting to put on a Hollywood Cavalcade show. A concurrent plot involves a wanna be actor Joe Simpson played by legendary Eddie Cantor who befriends Joan Leslie,an aspiring song writer and Dennis Morgan,an aspiring singer. Now Joe just""happens"" to look like Eddie Cantor and Eddie(Cantor plays himself also) holds the contract for Dinah Shore whom Sakall and Horton want for their show. Through alot of plot twists and funny turns,the show goes on successfully. Cantor is absolutely wonderful in this film playing a believable dual role. Musical numbers abound of course in this film as the likes of Spike Jones(Hotcha Corn-ya),Hattie McDaniel and Willie Best doing a duet ""Ice Cold Katie""(watch for Best at the end getting a mouthful of confetti!),Betty Davis singing""They're always too Young or too Old"",Errol Flynn talking/singing ""That's what they Jolly well Get"",Dinah Shore in numerous lovely numbers,Anne Sheridan,Jack Carson and Alan Hale in an hilarious ""Goin' North"" routine,Dennis Morgan and Eddie Cantor, sing and strut their stuff in grand style. There is a fantasy number sung by Dennis Morgan called ""Good Night,Good Neighbour"" which features Alexis Smith in it. Dennis is seeing home and serenading a latin American beauty. This a nod,firstly,to the ""good neighbour policy"",specifically to our neighbours in South America. Secondly as you watch you are immediately struck by the fact that though well executed,the ideal person for the number should have been Carmen Miranda. But unfortunately Carmen was very busy lady over at 20th Century Fox.
This film is also famous for Sakall out-bullying Humphrey Bogart;it IS a funny moment with Bogart hoping his ""...fans don't hear about this"".The DVD includes a vintage newsreel,two musical shorts,a patriotic short,a vintage Bugs cartoon,trailers and the radio broadcast recreation of the show with much of the original cast.
""Hollywood Canteen"" also has an amazing list of Warner stars being trotted out to entertain us and entertain they do. The story is about a wounded GI Slim Green(fresh faced Robert Hutton) and Sgt Nowland(Dane Clark) who come back on medical leave to Hollywood. Slim wanders Hollywood alone looking at the sights until he ends up at the Hollywood Canteen,the famous service club for GIs. Eventually his sergeant joins him and Slim finds himself in love with actress Joan Leslie(it is mutual) and his sergeant with a studio guide. One night Slim returns and finds he is the 1,000,000th serviceman to enter the Canteen and is feted by one all and picks Leslie as his escort until he has to return to active duty at the end of the weekend. When his train is about to pull out for his return Joan,who ran out of gas,just makes it and frantically looks and finds her man and both end up kissing as the train pulls out(an all too familiar real war time scene).The plot is as transparent as Saran Wrap but it nonetheless is effective in relaying an undercurrent of sentiment and slight realism throughout. Hutton plays a reticent and shy GI to a tee and his performance really makes the picture work as well as it does. You can bet any real GI watching that film would have empathized fully with Slim. As co-founders of the real Hollywood Canteen,Bette Davis and John Garfield are in the movie throughout. The laughs and musicals kicks come from stars like Jack Benny,Joe E Brown,Peter Lorre,Sydney Greenstreet,Barbara Stanwyck,Joan Crawford,Joan McCracken,Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers,Carmen Cavalarro,Jimmy Dorsey,The Andrew Sisters and so many more. The DVD includes a vintage newsreel,three patriotic shorts,three vintage cartoons and trailers.
Technically each film of this set has been newly transferred with great care and some elements even restored.""This is the Army"" fell into the public domain sometime in the 70s and has been seen for years in a terrible,incomplete and washed out state. This print,fully restored,is simply magnificent. I don't think it looked any better in 1943!The other two films are in black and white and are likewise simply beautiful to behold. Warners is to be given top marks for their efforts here;they have gone the extra mile and it certainly shows.
In conclusion, I just cannot say enough about these films for their entertainment value and just how wonderful they all look. You will certainly find your favourites among these three gems but I warn you it will be tough deciding which. Each is packed with some of Warner Brothers/First Nationals' best stars of that era and are showcased in their best light. At the same time they provide us with as great an entertainment value now as they did over 65 years ago. Besides their obvious value as musicals they are now also historically important pieces. This set therefore is a definite must have;get yours now.",1233878400,16,7993,5.106951871657754

8292249,3,B001D7T44C,"I'm a big fan of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, that's the only reason I purchased this collection. Joan appears briefly in ""Hollywood Canteen"". Bette appears in ""Hollywood Canteen"" and ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"", although she doesn't get much screen time. I just skimmed through ""This is The Army"" because neither Bette nor Joan appear and because I absolutely despise Ronald Reagan and cheap patriotism.

There's not much to the plots of these films but there are some nice musical numbers. It was find of interesting to see Hollywood stars of the era ""acting"" as themselves in HC and TYLS.

There's a lot of White-Bread-And-Mayonnaise, Golly-Gee-Willikers, Bright-Eyed-And-Bushy-Tailed, Homespun, Awwww-Shucks, Hey-Kids-Let's-Put-On-A-Show, Sugary-Sweet, Wholesome, Family-Oriented, Big-Glass-of-Milk, Gosh-That's-Swell, Can-Do-Spirit and Relentless Optimism; as well as a healthy dose of Mindless Patriotic Propaganda.

He was born in 1938 and he grew up watching these movies and would tell me all about them and all the big time actors and actress. I miss him so much.
