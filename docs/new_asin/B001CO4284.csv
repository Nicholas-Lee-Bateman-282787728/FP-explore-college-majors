8288345,4,B001CO4284,"I did enjoy this DVD. I do have a couple of grievances though. One thing is that Ansuya doesn't really go over that many patterns. Another is, like another reviewer mentioned, the audio is not all that great in places. There are a couple of places especially with the 6/8 rythm that the audio just sounds awful. I couldn't watch this video with headphones on but it was bearable to pop it in the DVD player and watch it that way (I like to watch instructional videos before working with them to get an overview!). Anyways, I didn't feel that it detracted all that much from the overall instructional quality of the DVD. Ansuya has always been one of my absolute favorite bellydancers. Let's face it, for those who are serious about those four tiny brass objects that enhance the beautiful music we dance to, there just isn't a big market out there to really teach us the ins and outs of playing them and playing them well. So, I guess it's an issue of ""we've got it and you need it"" with this DVD. With that said, this DVD is great quality as far as what you can take away from it. It seems that there are areas though where ansuya just starts showing you how it's done without giving you a step-by-step instruction to follow along (I guess that's why they call it ""advanced"" finger cymbals after all). She just starts playing and you have to keep up.

She breaks down the rythm with a ""right-left-right"" explanation and also with a ""doum-tek-ka"" kind of explanation which is very good. Ultimately to play the cymbals well one has to be able to hear the underlying doums and teks of the darbuka/doumbek or you'll never truly grasp how to follow along with the music and will always depend upon rythm patterns that others have made up and you might not be able to grasp which pattern to play at all if you can't interpret what the drummer is playing!

Ansuya gives you some dance steps to help you get started coordinating playing and dancing at the same time as well. That's a plus I guess but it doesn't matter to me whether there was dancing in the DVD or not. I can figure that out I just wanted to add some more knowledge to my understanding of the zill lol.

I think that a beginner could use this DVD. She does take a minute to refresh your memory on the basic patterns. But I would start out first with something simpler first if you are just beginning on the zills. This DVD could have been more thorough but I still walked away with some new tips nonetheless. Unfortunately, zill playing is becoming a lost art. If you are serious about playing zills whether you dance or not then certainly get this DVD. Ansuya has been doing this a long time. She's a second generation bellydancer and has been dancing all her life. There's not much out there for the zills so grab up the knowledge when and where you can. This DVD did help me in ""spicing"" up my zill playing that's for sure.",1389312000,,2886,4.400749063670412
8288346,4,B001CO4284,"You'll want to have a notebook with you when you watch this DVD!  Ansuya goes through the 6/8, 9/8 and Masmoudi rhythms.  She tells you the counts, the ""doom-teks"", and then shows you her hands.  She then goes over some simple footwork set to music so you have an idea of how to move your body to this rhythm.  The best part of this DVD was the very end where she gives you some of her zill tricks--rotating your wrist when you play instead of just moving your fingers together to prevent wrist fatigue, and mixing up singles and 3's when you are playing.

I only wish that there had been more dancing in this DVD.  Also, if you didn't already know what a Masmoudi rhythm sounds like or your ""dooms"" from your ""teks"", you'd be lost.  The music she chose for the 9/8 section was very fast!  I found myself reverting to the way my teacher approaches zills, thinking in your head ""I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can really dance I can really dance"" instead of ""doom teka doom teka tek tekatek teka doom teka-teka teka teka-teka teka teka"".  For the advanced dancer or instructor, this is a DVD you will want to watch though.",1361664000,2,1144,4.308411214953271
8288347,5,B001CO4284,"I love Ansuya and I probably own almost all of her DVD's. I gave this DVD 5 out of 5 stars. There are 2 things that I would change: I wish there were more zill patterns and I wished she explained the zill patterns like she did in her first DVD. In her first Finger Cymbal DVD, she broke down the patterns into sections, then you drilled the section, and then you put the pattern together. Now, because I believe that this DVD is geared for someone who knows how to play zills that could be why there is less explanation than the first DVD. However, that doesn't mean that you can add more zill patterns to your repertoire. There are several pros about this DVD:
* I like the Zill Drill where you practice the pattern and doing the step to help build up the stamina
* I like the explanation of how to get different sounds of the Finger Cymbals and then doing a Finger Cymbal pattern drill
* I like the Improvisation where she shows you how you change zill patterns and offers a quick of review of Zill patterns from Learn Finger Cymbal DVD
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to continue to grow in the Finger Cymbal playing!!",1353196800,,1136,4.263888888888889
8288348,4,B001CO4284,"This is a good dvd, however I was expecting more zill patterns. Also, it went just a bit too fast, so I had to keep rewinding. Overall worth the money(discounted) I paid for it.",1234224000,2,177,4.235294117647059
8288349,2,B001CO4284,"The sound track on this dvd is deplorable and annoying.  The sound of the zills is not sharp and clear, instead its muffled and difficult to hear the difference between a tek and a dum.  With an instructional zill dvd you would think that the soundtrack quality would be critical.  In all honesty, I wanted to like this dvd.  I like Ansuya and enjoyed her first zill dvd.  I tried two copies and played it on three different dvd players with the same result - a terrible sound track.  I don't understand why IAMED released such a poor product when they have a great track record of quality dvds.  As far as using this dvd for drilling, it's too painful for me to listen to.  I will be resellling my copy once I write out the rhythm patterns.",1228521600,9,741,4.318840579710145
