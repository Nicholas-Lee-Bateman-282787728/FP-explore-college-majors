2766676,5,B000NDI3OE,"The two logos are the ghastly logo for ""Entertainment Rights"", whatever that is, which looks like Soviet People's Art, and the excellent Ghostbusters logo which doesn't appear on the box but is on the enclosed booklet. As usual, I differ with whoever designed the packaging, since the moaning ghost logo which began and ended the shows, and was used for bumpers (see the special features) was one of the best parts of the show.

Ghostbusters was remarkable for about a million reasons. It was a show, as Filmation producer Lou Scheimer notes, in which everything came together. What that really means is that it's a live action show done on the miniscule cartoon budgets that were standard for kids' TV. It was written very fast, as cartoons are. It starred a likable, humorous cast: Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch of F- Troop, who essentially played the same parts as F-Troop and as in their cartoon voice over work. The amazing addition was Bob Burns, who plays the most lifelike gorilla probably ever seen on TV. The show is a ghostbusting take on Gangbusters, with a vaguely '20s feel: Larry dresses the part, Forrest doesn't). As the theme song says, ""I'm Spenser, he's Tracy, I'm Kong. You'd think Kong would be the gorilla; he's not. Tracy is the gorilla. Forest is Kong.

There are only three sets: a graveyard, a haunted house hallway, and a room in the creepy house. The guest stars read like a whose who of (then) current television. As with cartoon voiceovers, kids' shows are wildly popular with adult actors who get to let out their kid side. Brilliantly, however, the show never played down to its audience. Kids don't need to ""get it"". They don't need to follow the plot. They relate to the characters and want to be in on the action. This is why it's so tragic that live hosts are gone. They are the natural ones to show cartoons, and form an immediate bond with kids.

Ghostbusters brilliantly worked a number of repeating schticks. Every episode Spenser and Tracy would drive their old '20s car to a junk shop to get their assignment, Mission Impossible/ Get Smart style from a different unlikely object, which after playing the tape would self- destruct in five seconds. Tracy would hold it and count down in the repeating gag. Another is that Tracy would don a variety of hats, some relevant to the plot, some not. He never spoke but he grunted in a meaningful way, drew doodles and did charades to get his ideas across, and dragged an assortment of props for visual gags onto the sets. The show's credits say ""Tracy trained by Bob Burns,"" so kids thought he really was a gorilla. Burns is also known for his vast collection of sci-fi memorabilia (see the book Blast Off). One of the best extra features in this set is the interview with Burns, although the interview with Scheimer is also good.

One not very great extra is an episode of Filmation's Ghostbusters cartoon, which is unwatchably bad for reasons that many mid- eighties cartoons are bad. Ten years after this 1974-5 Live action show, Ghostbusters, came the 1984 Bill Murray Ghostbusters blockbuster film. I wondered then how the movie could use the same title. The conflict came during the cartoon spin-offs. DIC's The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, spun off from the movie, ran in 1986. The same year, Filmation made a cartoon version of the live action show. DIC's is by far the better cartoon because they had the comic trio from the film (mostly voiced by Arsenio Hall) as cartoon stars. Filmation's show suffered from bland, badly drawn human characters which, for whatever reason, bore no resemblance to Storch or Tucker, nor for that matter, did the gorilla to Tracy. Despite that, the closing titles feature lavish surrealistic backgrounds, testimony to the uneven artistry of mid- '80s cartoons.

However, to return to the live action show, in the last episode, the song on the radio is ""Sugar Sugar"", the number one charting song by The Archies, which came from Filmation's 1968 The Archie Show. But here Filmation started with great human characters: the gang from Riverdale. Those doing Cartoons Without Cable will find Ghostbusters a wonderful change from cartoons. Play one episode along with a favorite cartoon like Garfield and Friends to make a great hour of kids' TV. There are only fifteen episodes, but Ink and Paint has done a great job with this budget set, which consists of two double- sided discs in a slip case with credits and copious notes. There's even a computer ROM feature that enables you to read all the scripts. A blast from the past recalling a magic moment when great hearts made great kids' TV.",1184803200,13,4614,4.776942355889724
2766677,5,B000NDI3OE,"OK.  I was 10 and [...] when this show originally aired on Saturday morning TV. I remember watching it.  I remember really liking it.  I bought it here on Amazon just as a kind of nostalgia thing from my childhood.  Geez!  I forgot how FUNNY this show really was.  As I watch now, some 30 years later, I can remember the shows.  But, more than anything, I can't stop laughing.  I think that a lot of the shows that I have bought for nostalgia's sake have kept me entertained, but I just can't get enough of this.  I wish there were more episodes.  On another note, I always remember the ""I'm Spencer, He's Tracy. And I'm Kong"" bit of the opening.  First of all, you'd imagine that Kong would be the gorilla, but it's not.  Then, even at that age I wondered: Was there some kind of reference there to Spencer Tracy, the actor, or was that just a big coincidence?  Haven't watched the extras yet.  Even without them.  This is a great show! You will laugh and laugh!!!",1179187200,16,965,4.312849162011173

2766679,4,B000NDI3OE,"Despite confusion on the part of the Amazon web site, this is the 1975 Live Action television show ""The Ghost Busters.""  Amazon lists voice talents by the likes of Dave Coulier & Arsenio Hall, obviously referring to the animated show ""The Real Ghostbusters,"" which was a spin-off of the movie franchise.

I was not around when the show first aired in '75, but that didn't stop me from watching it when I was a kid.  I used to rent the VHS copies that were available of a couple of the episodes, like ""The Maltese Monkey"" and ""The Canterville Ghost.""  All of them kept me entertained at a young age and shockingly very well as an adult.

Spenser, Tracy & Kong have never looked better in this amazingly jam-packed DVD set.  I would've been just fine having the series' 15 episodes, but this set contains more than a few special features.  There are interviews with the cast and crew of the show, television bumpers for the show, photo galleries, and even a bonus episode of the cartoon version of the show, Filmation's ""Ghostbusters.""  Also, exclusive to the DVD-Rom features is the ability to download each script from the shows' 15 episodes.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who grew up watching it as a kid at any age.  It is nostalgic to say the least and belongs in the libraries of any Ghost Buster fan.",1176854400,28,1315,4.5574468085106385
2766680,4,B000NDI3OE,"Before the movie, before Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray went beyond Saturday Night, there was the live-action Saturday Morning Series called The Ghost Busters.

Originally from Filmation's live-action library, The Ghost Busters starred famous F-Troop team Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch as Jake Kong and Eddie Spencer, and Tracy their gorilla.

Unlike most of Filmation's live series, The Ghost Busters focused a bit more on humour than just being action with comedy relief.  Basically, loosely using the 'Mission Impossible' schtick (heavily used in Saturday Morning spy shows) to obtain their assignments.  Jake, Eddie and Tracy would deal with the likes of demented spirits, wacky vampires and other spectre and ghouls from haunting the mortal world.

Humour was used a lot in the show, sometimes through classic visual stunts or puns.  Case in point, when dealing with a vampire, Jake finds out one thing they fear is a wooden 'stake', whereas Tracy pulls out a wooden 'steak.'  And when Eddie attempts to disclaim Tracy's attempt, he ends up getting a splinter from the 'steak.'

However, because it was Saturday Morning TV, The Ghost Busters normally vanquished rogue spirits with a Polaroid-esque device called the Dematerializer.  As the name suggested, when fired at a ghost, the screen would appear with a blue screen effect and the ghost would 'dematerialize' out from the mortal world.

Though I believe it only had one season in 1975, the series was often ran in syndication on Sunday mornings as well.  Ironically, though the name was used for the film, there was no real connection between it and the series.  Despite well-box office reviews, many still felt the Akroyd and Murray film did not capture the same fun as the original series.  So in 1986, Filmation revived the series in animated form:  Filmation's Ghostbusters.

Here, however, the offspring of the original Ghost Busters and Tracy dealt with a nemesis called Prime Evil (think Terminator merged with a specter) and his ghoulish legion of ghosts.  Whereas in the original series, the Ghost Busters simply obtained assignments from the mysterious Agent Zero.

What really made Ghost Busters appealing for it's time, as with most Filmation Live Action, was it did have great storytelling, and really made the limited special effects work.  Also for F-Troop fans, the comedy stilings of Tucker and Storch made the show enjoyable, and it was a wonder Filmation didn't consent with Hanna-Barbera for a spot on the Scooby-Doo Movies (since they aired about the same year).

I'd definitely recommend this product for not only fans of the classic series, but for those who loved Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch, as well as a new generation of viewers.",1173916800,16,2719,5.110859728506787

2766743,5,B000NDI3OE,"It was a complete joy to see this show again after thirty-four years! Yes, it is hammy and ultra-low budget, but it is freaking Shakespeare compared to the current Nick line-up! Bob Burns shines as Tracey the gorilla and it is so great to see Larry and Forest together again and at only 15 episodes the series is short enough to get through but not long enough to wear out its' welcome. Plus there are a ton of guest stars like Ted ""Mary Tyler Moore/Caddyshack"" Knight and Jim ""Mr. Magoo"" Bachus involved. And the extras! A shocking number for a series that is not considered ""influential"" or ""important"". BCI went WAY above the call of duty on this one with the extras!

As to the video quality, it holds up very well for a mid-70's video tape production. Luckily the source materials were well preserved. It is not hi-def, but it is certainly watchable.

My son is four and loves this show. It contains no ""gross"" humor (unlike almost every kid's show since ""Ren & Stimpy""), no toy pushing and since the episodes are only about 22 minutes long, they are great for kids with short attention spans. Not to mention that the ""horror"" elements are really toned down. I can't see a kid getting nightmares from this show. Highly recommended.",1257984000,3,1236,4.588235294117647

The original ""unreal"" Ghost Busters are Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch from F Troop reunited with a gorilla named Tracy.  Ultra-cheap Saturday morning fare, and in each episode a different ghost takes up residence in the same haunted house.  Every week Spensser (Storch) can't get the filing cabinet to open.  In every episode Kong (Tucker) sends Spensser and Tracy (what, no Hepburn?) to pick up the next ghost busting assignment, and it blows up in Tracy's hands.  Extremely repetitive, but the fun part is seeing who the ghost is.  Lots of celebrity guests like Jim Backus, Carl Ballantine, Severn Darden, and Huntz Hall.  The theme song is great, with lines like ""your skin has the creepies.""",1243814400,5,813,5.067669172932331
2766745,3,B000NDI3OE,"Now I'm more familiar with the cartoon that was spun off of this show, but even then I only saw handful of the episodes in syndication. Over the years and thanks to sites like wiki I've leaned a lot more about both the original show and the cartoon, in particular the whole debacle with the 1984 Ghostbusters film and how Filmation successfully sued the studio over the likeness to the 1975 show's logo. In fact, I believe that the Filmation cartoon spin-off is directly related to that lawsuit because Lou Scheimer wanted to go ahead and call it off in exchange for getting the license to create a cartoon based on the movie, but the studio chose not to do that, instead creating their own cartoon. Scheimer and company shot back by making a cartoon based on their previous show.

So anyway, I am a more or less coming to this show with no preconceived notions or nostalgia. So what's in the box? This set features the entire live action series, 15 episodes in total over two, double-sided discs, which are packaged into two DVD slim cases. There are five episodes per each side of the discs, with the flip side on the second disc containing all of the special features. The slipcase itself is pretty nice, though the cover has a very odd ""colorized"" look to it, which is weird because the show was shot in color. I believe the still that's used for the cover may have originally been B&W, but I'm not sure. Though the ""colorized"" look gives it that icky Photoshop feel, the image is pretty darn accurate to the feel of the opening credits, so I easily cut it some slack.

Also included is a foldout insert that is loaded with episode summaries as well as cast and crew information and trivia for each episode. Pretty much this insert is a nicely printed version of anything you'd hope to find on the show trivia wise and is a welcome addition to the set.

The reverse side of the insert features some basic info, mostly the same stuff that's included on the back of the box set, though as a nice little bonus they've added the theme song lyrics.

The menus on the DVD are pretty simple and easy to navigate. There's a ""play all"" function as well as a sub menu where you can choose a specific episode or where you can jump to a specific chapter. Pretty standard stuff. Since all of the special features are on the fourth side, most of this stuff is strictly episode oriented. Watch out for easter eggs though. I stumbled upon one while navigating through the menus on side one of the first disc. To access it, enter the chapter section menu for the episode ""The Canterville Ghost"" and then select the back option to return to the main episode menu. Next, press the up button once and you should be automatically taken to a snippet of Lou Scheimer talking about his feelings on nepotism that's pretty funny.

As far as the picture quality goes on these episodes, it's not so hot, maybe a 3 out of five or so. The show looks like it was shot on video and there are plenty of scenes that are hazy with some ghosting and light trails. Nothing that isn't common for TV shows of the 60s and 70s. Like the WKRP set, there's not much restoration work that can be done with video so the quality is about the best it's going to get and probably isn't that far gone from how it looked when it originally aired.

As far as the show itself I was pleasantly surprised. Having missed out on most of the live action children's shows of the late 60s and 70s I've always been curious to see what these shows were like, mostly because it's the sort of programming that my sister grew up with. The show is very campy and crazily over acted, but it's totally on par with stuff like Sesame Street or the Electric Company, though with a lot less education and a lot more laughs.  In fact it's a little bit more like Land of the Lost, though obviously not on such an epic scale but it's more about entertaining kids than teaching them anything.  Actually the show reminds me a lot of a live action Scooby Doo, only on limited sets with less characters.  Tracy is very much cast from the same mold as Scooby Doo, except he grunts and snorts instead of ""ralking rike riss.""

There are basically three main stars in the show, Forrest Tucker as ""Jake"" Kong, the leader of the group of ghost busters, Larry Storch plays Spencer, Kong's sidekick and comic foil, and rounding out the group and bringing a little bit of absurdity into the mix is Bob Burns as Tracy the gorilla, playing Harpo Marx to Tucker & Storch's Groucho & Zeppo.  Both Storch and Tucker are playing off of the same dynamic that they used in the show F-Troop, so it's certainly refined and comfortable. In a silly twist, Burns is credited as the trainer for Tracy, which lead many people to believe that Tracy was a real gorilla and not Burns in his Gorilla costume.

Each show opens on the same graveyard set where the ghost or creature would introduce themselves and layout the basic plot, typically in search of something in the nearby house or castle. This would then fade into the credits sequence which introduces the Ghost Busters.
Coming from a studio that specialized in animation it was interesting to see Filmation using some animated sequences to bridge the gap between sets, in particular a nicely painted and pretty spooky scene of the nearby old house.

All of the episodes used more or less the same format. A ghost is introduced before the credits roll, then there would be a silly scene with Storch, Tucker and Burns in the Ghost Busters HQ that inevitably ended with Kong ordering Spencer and Tracy out to get their weekly mission from the mysterious Zero. These mission gathering sequences kind of stand out from the rest of the show because they were the only ones shot on location instead of on set. These sequences for all 15 episodes were shot back to back and then edited into the various episodes later to save on production costs.

In each episode, Spencer and Tracy would pull up to a junk shop where Tracy would get an object that would have a hidden secret mission in it from Zero. Playing off of shows like Mission Impossible and Get Smart the object would always self-destruct 3 to 5 seconds after the tape ended blowing up in Tracy's face, a gag that was later utilized in the Inspector Gadget cartoon. Sometimes the message is hidden in a rubber chicken, sometimes in a bike or cake, and it always explodes with a silly effect. The rest of the show would play out with the Ghost Busters bumbling their way in perfect slapstick style to a confrontation with the ghost or creature which would then be dispatched with their ghost dematerializer.

All 15 episodes were written my Marc Richards, and in many cases overnight as the production schedule was rushed for monetary reasons on the show. Because of this the shows all feel very much like they were written in a template style, but honestly it works perfectly for the audience they were shooting for. Yet even with these threadbare plots, insanely over the top visual gags, and bad puns there was also a certain amount of creativity and subtlety. In the first episode, The Maltese Monkey, the resident ghost is a character named Big Al, a gangster who is more or less the mirror twin of Spencer (right down to the cool colored zoot suit and is obviously also played by Storch.) Storch hams up the Big Al character by doing his best Marlon Brando Godfather impression, yet later in the episode when the Spencer character goes under cover as Big Al, Storch switches to his James Cagney, a gag to be sure, but something that would completely go over the head of the target audience. It sure as heck isn't Shakespeare, but it's a welcome bit of good acting and humor that surprised me nonetheless.

The production values on the show were pretty good considering how fast and cheaply it was shot. I believe there were only about five or six sets (a graveyard, a castle, a few rooms, and the GB HQ) and only one actual location (for the ""accepting the mission"" scenes), and the costume work was decent. They managed to do up a pretty good Frankenstein's monster, thought he runner mask on the wolfman left a little bit to be desired.  Then best part of the show though was the gorilla suit that Bob Burns brought with him to the show.  In particulat it has an awesome mask that was custom made to fit to Burns' head and face and therefore he can really bring it to life.  To this day it's still one of the better gorilla suits I've ever seen.

There were also a nice cadre of guest stars including Billy Barty and Ted Knight who both turn in relatively fun if not crazily over the top performances.
Being a BCI Eclipse box set, the Ghost Busters DVDs have their fair share of special features produced by Andy Mangels.

Included in the special features are interviews with the show's producer and Filmation head honcho Lou Scheimer as well as Bob Burns who both provided the Tracy costume and preformed in it. Burns recalls the story of how he got the gig on the DVDs as well as on his website. Basically he was friends with a lady who was associated on the Ghost Busters project who knew he had a gorilla suit and suggested he try out for the role. Burns is also well known in horror, sci-fi and fantasy circles for his stunning collection of movie props and memorabilia including such sought after treasures as the original armature that served as the skeleton for the original King Kong movie. Peter Jackson sought Burns' help when working on his remake and even gave both Bob and his wife cameos in the film.

The set also features some more basic features including production and behind the scenes photo galleries, trailers, DVD Rom scripts, and an nice collection of trailers from other Filmation DVD sets (already available or upcoming.) The interviews were a little weird as you can see above that the screen was shrunk down to a little box with Ghost Buster imagery behind it. Typically these interviews, shot against green screen like this, are then composited into a show style background like the graveyard or something, and it almost seems as if these were rushed and just dumped on the DVDs.

By far though one of the best special features, and one of my favorite special features that I've seen in recent years, is a bonus episode of the animated spin-off show from 1986. It's interesting to compare and contrast the style of the 70s Filmation style with that of the 80s. The episode included on this set is titled, ""I'll be a son of a Ghost Buster"" which serves as the origin episode and ties the new series to the old.
All in all, this set, which retails for between $20-$30, is more or less produced with a specific audience in mind, those that grew up with it and want to recapture some childhood nostalgia, so it probably won't appeal to most people, in fact I think most people would probably hate it. But it does have a lot of appeal for those of us that enjoy monster related entertainment, in particular fans of the sillier stuff like Scooby Doo, the Groovie Goolies, the Milton the Monster Show, the Munsters, or the Addams Family.  It'll also be of interest to anyone who really digs the 1986 cartoon and wants to know a little bit more about that show's roots.",1238457600,27,11208,4.520730503455084
2766746,4,B000NDI3OE,"A long time ago a friend of mine told me that that there was an old Ghostbusters show that was played on Saturday mornings during the seventies. He remembered that the show was something special and felt that the movie made in 1984 had more than a passing glance to this show. Being a fan of the movie, I was tempted to check it out and what sold me on it was the it had Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker from F-Troop. I was pleasantly surprised that this show contains some of the best work from these two actors. I'm not forgetting Bob Burns who plays Tracy, he does well enough for a man dressed in a gorilla suit. The TV show is obviously made for kids, filled with very cheap sets that are used repeatedly from episode to episode, all with similar gags. It is a cross between Scooby Doo and Get Smart. With ghost chases through multiple doors and secret exploding messages from an informer named Zero.
  Despite its target audience and low budget, many times the show's cleverness overcomes its handicaps. After watching it, I understood what my friend meant by the movie having more than a passing glance at this show. I cannot believe that Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis did not see this show before making the movie. Especially when it comes to the personalities of the three heroes, the sight gags, and their ray gun. If you're a fan of F-Troop this show is a must see. If you're a fan of the Ghostbusters movie it is something that should be checked out. This show is actually a lot of fun and does cause a chuckle every now and again. But don't look for a lot of special effects and high production values.",1234828800,4,1613,4.391304347826087

I remember this show very much, however, i thought there were more episodes than 15?...but anyways, i was really happy to get this to add to my childhood memories.

8177308,4,B000NDI3OE,"This is so funny, I've always wanted a copy, but the price is just say too much.  However when you watch it, it's hard to believe that it was a kid's show.  My favorite guest ghost was always The Red Baton and his ""greasy monkey"" (mechanic with a southern accent).  I'll keep an eye on this one and if it ever gets reasonable, I'll snap it up.",1516406400,,343,4.08955223880597

8177314,5,B000NDI3OE,"I remember reruns of this on Saturday morning when fox was just starting out as a channel. Loved Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker on F Troop, Bob Burns makes Tracy the gorilla fun. It's a cheap cheesy kids show from the 70's. There's probably only three or four sets in total but the actors and writers made it work. Wish it would have lasted more than one season. No extras but just finding this gem in clean clear video and audio is enough for me!",1490745600,,448,4.2823529411764705

8177316,4,B000NDI3OE,"This has nothing to do with the famous ""Ghost Busters"" film series. It was a Saturday morning  live-action kid's show from the mid '70's. Shot on video tape, it is pretty silly at times but is saved by the many seasoned performers in guest-star roles. Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch work as well together here as they did in ""F Troop"".",1484438400,2,336,4.508196721311475
