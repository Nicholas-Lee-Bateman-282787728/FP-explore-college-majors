3116649,4,B0013LPS34,"The third season features some great tales of hauntings, house cleanings, exorcisms and delving into the demonic. The episodes have gotten better and still keep one's attention.

I love that her friend Jane finds reassurance in her blessed saint medalons.  My favorite part of the show is when Mary, the possesed, Mary's sister, and Jane go to John Zafis' house in Stratford, Connecticut and Father Larry Elward performs the exorcism on Mary. I love it when Mary says, ""Take your present Jane!  Don't you want your present?  Take your present or Satan will shift your slag!""  Does anyone know what ""shift your slag"" means?  This is an excellent docu-drama about demonic possesion.  I was possesed myself, so I can relate to Mary quit while.  Thank you for reading my review.

3116658,5,B0013LPS34,"Airing on the Discovery Channel from October to December 2006, A Haunting: Season 3 is probably my favorite season, although all four seasons were great.  Narrated by Anthony Call (The FBI Files), this series presents supposedly true real life ghost stories of ordinary people who have lived them.  These events are re-enacted with actors along with comments from the actual people who lived these events.  Some of the strange things that occur in  these episodes are ghost sightings, general paranormal activity, demonic activity, and possession.  These events happened in every corner of the U.S. as well as a few countries outside the U.S.  The usual pattern of events consists of people experiencing strange activity, followed by fear, then a paranormal investigator and/or a priest enters the picture.  These stories are presented in a subtle, yet creepy and haunting way.  The narration by Anthony Call is superb, as is the eerie music present throughout each episode.  The ghostly imagery is also well done, using some CGI as well as some cheap yet effective special effects.

My personal favorite episodes in Season 3 are Hidden Terror, The Dark Side, The Attic, and The Presence.  All the episodes throughout the series are designed to do one thing - send chills down the spine, and that they do.  Whether or not these stories are true (after all, some people will do anything to get on TV) really doesn't matter.  What matters is the spookiness and entertainment value of the episodes.  If one can watch horror movies, one can watch A Haunting.

I highly recommend this great series on the Discovery Channel.  It's too bad the series was canceled in late 2007, much to the disappointment of many people.",1296864000,6,1713,4.97887323943662
3116695,5,B0013LPS34,"i love the haunting, i now have 1 to 4, ive been watching them with my mum we love the supernatural and how it scares us at night, i love how this show is base on true events.i wouldn't say its scary but it does make you look in the dark at night.",1287100800,,247,3.6792452830188678
3116696,5,B0013LPS34,"I already reviewed seasons 1 and 2 so I figured I may as well review 3 also.
Now, with most TV shows the quality seems to go way down as the show progresses.
Not here.
Not even close.
My favorite episode has to be ""The Presence"". I think I jumped off the couch three times just during this episode.

Ok, the good?
Great stories.
Great narration.
Decent acting.
Deliciously creepy music.

The bad?
Nothing really.
For those of you who are expecting a Hollywood type of experience then you need to look elsewhere.
For those of you looking for real but creepy ghost stories, look no further. I love this series; I wish they never would have cancelled it. :(

A Haunting Season 3 comes.....

3116698,5,B0013LPS34,"I have always liked the way the series has been presented.  Season 3 is another great entry into an equally great series.  It is always good for a certain level of creepiness without getting too gory or bloody.  Each episode is great to watch and they do not get old, regardless of how many times you watch them.  Sit back and enjoy the scare.",1252195200,,343,4.3125
3116699,5,B0013LPS34,"I'm a fan of the show, and have the entire seasons 1-4, which I also purchased for my mom. This supernatural-themed show is engaging and interesting - drawing viewers into the various stories through credible re-enactments, interspersed with actual interviews with paranormal experts and witnesses.

In Season 3, the theme is ""Haunted Houses, Demonic Angels"" and the episodes are [no particular order]:
The Wheatsheaf Horror - a psychic investigates a murderous spirit in an English pub.
The Possessed - when those who try to protect others from falling prey to supernatural entities are themselves afflicted.
The Presence - a young family battles unearthly entities in their home.
The Dark Side - Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators, are enlisted to help a warring couple whose marital troubles attracts a demonic presence.
The Unleashed - an inquisitive young man unleashes terrifying entities through the use of ancient incantations.
A Haunting in Ireland - a new baby causes a family in Galway to be haunted by a restless spirit.
The Forgotten - a Victorian home undergoes renovation, only to awaken an evil ghost, and revealing the house's tragic past.
Fear House - a man and his kids escape a haunted house, but the father returns to help the new inhabitants.
The Attic - a young mother senses an unearthly presence in her new home that might threaten the safety of her son.
Hidden Terror - a man resorts to technology to uncover strange happenings in his home, with suprising consequences.

The DVD features no extras. There are interactive menus and chapter selection options. I'd highly recommend this series to those who love supernatural-themed shows that are high on atmosphere.",1248566400,5,1703,5.144404332129964
3116700,5,B0013LPS34,"Season 3 of A Haunting continues to provide well made documentaries of paranormal experiences and investigations.  The episodes are just as good, and in some cases better, than those from Seasons 1 & 2.  A Haunting is a documentary series that explores allegedly true tales of hauntings, ghosts and the paranormal.  Each show is composed of high quality atmospheric reenactments that follow descriptions of eyewitnesses.  Superimposed on the action is the creepy, measured voice of a narrator who sets the mood and explains the events.  The show is exceptionally effective.  Most episodes have at least some unnerving moments and some are downright scary.  Viewers interested in the paranormal should love this series as should people who like horror movies.

Below is a short description of each episode in Season 3.  The number in parentheses is my ""scariness rating""; scale = 1-5 with 5 being the scariest.  Minor spoilers throughout.

Fear House - Two separate families independently experience terrifying events in a Missouri house that seems to be able to identify and attack a persons deepest fears (3)

The Attic - Several entities, one good, one harmful, torment a Michigan family when they move into a new home (1)

Hidden Terror - Mysterious ghosts scare a young couple and their friend away from a house in upstate New York (2)

The Unleashed -  A young Michigan man unwisely dabbles in black magic over the site of an Indian burial ground and releases demons that psychologically attack him and his family (2)

A Haunting in Ireland -  The arrival of a new baby into an Irish household triggers extreme poltergeist activity (3)

The Forgotten - When a young family moves into a one hundred year old home in Salt Lake City, they discover a sinister hidden room where an evil entity dwells (4)

The Wheatsheaf Horror - The use of an ad hoc Ouija board leads to the dramatic escalation of paranormal activity in an English pub where a young girl was murdered (3)

The Possessed - The paranormal investigation of a Virginia barn used for satanic rituals goes awry when the lead investigator becomes possessed by a demonic entity (3)

The Presence - A dysfunctional family is the target of paranormal attack when they move into a northern California house where a demon was unleashed by Black Mass (4)

The Dark Side - An exceptionally creepy New England house is the site of recurrent paranormal events; when a young couple buys the property they discover that the current residents have nailed all of the upstairs doors closed (4)",1233878400,33,2540,4.899297423887588

3351146,4,B0013LPS34,"The third season features some great tales of hauntings, house cleanings, exorcisms and delving into the demonic. The episodes have gotten better and still keep one's attention. One of the best features Eda and Lorraine Warren. This series is habit-forming for those who are sincerely interested in paranormal investigations.",1396137600,,325,5.653061224489796
3351147,5,B0013LPS34,"I never thought I'd like a show like this, well I do enjoy Ghost Hunters,etc, but one that basically just tells the story instead of doing actual investigations, but this one has a lot of ""scare factors"" that the others don't I really enjoyed this show.",1389398400,,253,4.521739130434782

3351151,5,B0013LPS34,"My favorite ""A Haunting"" is ""The Possesed"".  The actress who plays the paranormal investigator who gets possesed does an excellent job.  I love that her friend Jane finds reassurance in her blessed saint medalons.  My favorite part of the show is when Mary, the possesed, Mary's sister, and Jane go to John Zafis' house in Stratford, Connecticut and Father Larry Elward performs the exorcism on Mary. I love it when Mary says, ""Take your present Jane!  Don't you want your present?  Take your present or Satan will shift your slag!""  Does anyone know what ""shift your slag"" means?  This is an excellent docu-drama about demonic possesion.  I was possesed myself, so I can relate to Mary quit while.  Thank you for reading my review.  Happy haunting!",1365033600,,749,4.873015873015873

Get ready to be spooked!",1357689600,,309,4.254237288135593

3351155,5,B0013LPS34,"Airing on the Discovery Channel from October to December 2006, A Haunting: Season 3 is probably my favorite season, although all four seasons were great.  Narrated by Anthony Call (The FBI Files), this series presents supposedly true real life ghost stories of ordinary people who have lived them.  These events are re-enacted with actors along with comments from the actual people who lived these events.  Some of the strange things that occur in  these episodes are ghost sightings, general paranormal activity, demonic activity, and possession.  These events happened in every corner of the U.S. as well as a few countries outside the U.S.  The usual pattern of events consists of people experiencing strange activity, followed by fear, then a paranormal investigator and/or a priest enters the picture.  These stories are presented in a subtle, yet creepy and haunting way.  The narration by Anthony Call is superb, as is the eerie music present throughout each episode.  The ghostly imagery is also well done, using some CGI as well as some cheap yet effective special effects.

My personal favorite episodes in Season 3 are Hidden Terror, The Dark Side, The Attic, and The Presence.  All the episodes throughout the series are designed to do one thing - send chills down the spine, and that they do.  Whether or not these stories are true (after all, some people will do anything to get on TV) really doesn't matter.  What matters is the spookiness and entertainment value of the episodes.  If one can watch horror movies, one can watch A Haunting.

I highly recommend this great series on the Discovery Channel.  It's too bad the series was canceled in late 2007, much to the disappointment of many people.",1296864000,6,1713,4.97887323943662
3351192,5,B0013LPS34,"i love the haunting, i now have 1 to 4, ive been watching them with my mum we love the supernatural and how it scares us at night, i love how this show is base on true events.i wouldn't say its scary but it does make you look in the dark at night.",1287100800,,247,3.6792452830188678
3351193,5,B0013LPS34,"I already reviewed seasons 1 and 2 so I figured I may as well review 3 also.
Now, with most TV shows the quality seems to go way down as the show progresses.
Not here.
Not even close.
My favorite episode has to be ""The Presence"". I think I jumped off the couch three times just during this episode.

Ok, the good?
Great stories.
Great narration.
Decent acting.
Deliciously creepy music.

The bad?
Nothing really.
For those of you who are expecting a Hollywood type of experience then you need to look elsewhere.
For those of you looking for real but creepy ghost stories, look no further. I love this series; I wish they never would have cancelled it. :(

A Haunting Season 3 comes.....
Highly Recommended!!!",1275955200,3,708,4.559055118110236

3351195,5,B0013LPS34,"I have always liked the way the series has been presented.  Season 3 is another great entry into an equally great series.  It is always good for a certain level of creepiness without getting too gory or bloody.  Each episode is great to watch and they do not get old, regardless of how many times you watch them.  Sit back and enjoy the scare.",1252195200,,343,4.3125
3351196,5,B0013LPS34,"I'm a fan of the show, and have the entire seasons 1-4, which I also purchased for my mom. This supernatural-themed show is engaging and interesting - drawing viewers into the various stories through credible re-enactments, interspersed with actual interviews with paranormal experts and witnesses.

In Season 3, the theme is ""Haunted Houses, Demonic Angels"" and the episodes are [no particular order]:
The Wheatsheaf Horror - a psychic investigates a murderous spirit in an English pub.
The Possessed - when those who try to protect others from falling prey to supernatural entities are themselves afflicted.
The Presence - a young family battles unearthly entities in their home.
The Dark Side - Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators, are enlisted to help a warring couple whose marital troubles attracts a demonic presence.
The Unleashed - an inquisitive young man unleashes terrifying entities through the use of ancient incantations.
A Haunting in Ireland - a new baby causes a family in Galway to be haunted by a restless spirit.
The Forgotten - a Victorian home undergoes renovation, only to awaken an evil ghost, and revealing the house's tragic past.
Fear House - a man and his kids escape a haunted house, but the father returns to help the new inhabitants.
The Attic - a young mother senses an unearthly presence in her new home that might threaten the safety of her son.
Hidden Terror - a man resorts to technology to uncover strange happenings in his home, with suprising consequences.

The DVD features no extras. There are interactive menus and chapter selection options. I'd highly recommend this series to those who love supernatural-themed shows that are high on atmosphere.",1248566400,5,1703,5.144404332129964
3351197,5,B0013LPS34,"Season 3 of A Haunting continues to provide well made documentaries of paranormal experiences and investigations.  The episodes are just as good, and in some cases better, than those from Seasons 1 & 2.  A Haunting is a documentary series that explores allegedly true tales of hauntings, ghosts and the paranormal.  Each show is composed of high quality atmospheric reenactments that follow descriptions of eyewitnesses.  Superimposed on the action is the creepy, measured voice of a narrator who sets the mood and explains the events.  The show is exceptionally effective.  Most episodes have at least some unnerving moments and some are downright scary.  Viewers interested in the paranormal should love this series as should people who like horror movies.

Below is a short description of each episode in Season 3.  The number in parentheses is my ""scariness rating""; scale = 1-5 with 5 being the scariest.  Minor spoilers throughout.

Fear House - Two separate families independently experience terrifying events in a Missouri house that seems to be able to identify and attack a persons deepest fears (3)

The Attic - Several entities, one good, one harmful, torment a Michigan family when they move into a new home (1)

Hidden Terror - Mysterious ghosts scare a young couple and their friend away from a house in upstate New York (2)

The Unleashed -  A young Michigan man unwisely dabbles in black magic over the site of an Indian burial ground and releases demons that psychologically attack him and his family (2)

A Haunting in Ireland -  The arrival of a new baby into an Irish household triggers extreme poltergeist activity (3)

The Forgotten - When a young family moves into a one hundred year old home in Salt Lake City, they discover a sinister hidden room where an evil entity dwells (4)

The Wheatsheaf Horror - The use of an ad hoc Ouija board leads to the dramatic escalation of paranormal activity in an English pub where a young girl was murdered (3)

The Possessed - The paranormal investigation of a Virginia barn used for satanic rituals goes awry when the lead investigator becomes possessed by a demonic entity (3)
