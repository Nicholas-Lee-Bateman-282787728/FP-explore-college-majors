8628341,5,B00GX9HF7S,Great combo set for this concert recorded in 2013. Kinda wish they can put one more song on the cd though.,1449878400,,106,4.095238095238095
8628342,2,B00GX9HF7S,"Why is it that Black Sabbath can't put out an awesome full concert DVD/CD?  First they messed up the reunion DVD by having cuts during the songs to interviews which interrupted the performance.  Now on Live Gathered In Their Masses they leave 3 awesome tracks off of the main concert, Dirty Women, Electric Funeral and a great performance of a gem of a song, Under the Sun.  It is nice they threw them in as a bonus but why not just have the full concert run start to finish?  The CD is OK but you only get 10 of the 18 songs that were played at the concert which is yet another question of why?  Why not just put the whole concert in it's entirety on disc?  One last minor complaint and this one goes on Black Sabbath themselves and that is why play Symptom of the Universe if Ozzy isn't going to sing it?  As a huge Black Sabbath fan I don't want an instrumental version of such a great song, if you aren't going to play the song properly play another song.  Very good live performances with Black Sabbath sounding great but this could've been a phenomenal package and not just an OK one. With this package it's the little things that knocked it down in ratings for me.",1392508800,4,1171,4.266968325791855
