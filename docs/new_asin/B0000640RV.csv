1696694,4,B0000640RV,"I just saw this movie last night. I was flipping through the channels and decided to give this one a try. I thought it was going to be lame, but it wasn't! The comedic performances of Angie Harmon's secretary, full of inuendo and some pretty hysterical remarks really made it all worthwhile. John Lovitz and his gold-digger wife also contribute much with their love-hate dialouge. Denise Richards doesn't have a huge part, but does a good job in this comedy. Charlie Sheen, although not usually a favorite of mine, was pretty good in this one, thanks to Angie and her Sec. Enjoy!",1053129600,5,579,4.686274509803922
1696695,4,B0000640RV,"This was an interesting, sometimes narrow film. There were too many striking similarities to the movie ""Wall Street"" (Charlie Sheen was also in that) to be called anything different than a copy of it. While it was good, I kept wanting to picture Gordon Gekko as the head of the newspaper rather than the other guy. Overall good, but too much a copy of ""Wall Street"" to be recognized as different.",1052006400,,396,4.591549295774648
1696696,5,B0000640RV,"This was a movie at first I wasn't really crazy about seeing, but one day caught it on pay-per-view & it did catch my eye.  This is one of Charlie Sheens best films...  A big plus is Angie Harmon... She is an incredible & very beautiful actress.  All in all, the characters of this movie were well put together...",1031788800,,313,4.271186440677966
1696697,5,B0000640RV,"This movie is fun, funny and romntic. So what, the plot is thin and predictalbe ... Angie, Charlie and Denise are really great together!",1028592000,,136,4.708333333333333
1696698,4,B0000640RV,"This is a charming, if somewhat slight, made-for-pay-cable comedy that has some delightful moments to it.  Not a big fan of Charlie Sheen?  Well, he actually acquits himself very well as a down-on-his-luck yuppie whose gold-digging girlfriend leaves him, thus propelling him to reluctantly masquerade in her old job as an advice columnist.  Soon he becomes enamored of his boss at the newspaper (a VERY lovely Angie Harmon) and sparks soon fly.  ""Man discovers his 'feminine' side and becomes a better man for it"".  Basically.
This might be a better rent than purchase, but sometimes it's the small, charming movies like this one that grow on you and eventually warrant being added to your permanent video library.  This earnest little comedy is better than it sounds, better than it looks, and a delightful way to spend 90 minutes in front of the television.",1021420800,,859,4.972027972027972
1696699,5,B0000640RV,Very entertaining. I liked it!,1491436800,,30,5.2
1696700,5,B0000640RV,"Classic story of misdirection with a ""happy ending"" but not Charlie Sheen style, to an extent.
He's actually a good, clean, sober guy in this flick. And if you've enjoyed watching him on sitcoms before, pull up a chair or make room on the couch for this one too.
It's funny, gentlemanly, romantic, heartwarming and believable too. I mean if course in the end Charlie gets the girl. But which one? And why that one and not the obvious one?
A great movie to watch with a girl or a guy or to be politically correct...your significant other. It's teen safe because there's no sex and nudity involved.",1487289600,,596,4.527777777777778

 Watch this movie.  This is not fluff- but you won't get a headache over the plot either.

I don't want to really go into the story line because then it gives a lot away.

Trust me that all stars do a great job here and Tyler Perry showed an acting side I had never seen before and was pleasantly surprised by.

The movie was not overly sugary or sappy- aka: unbelievable to the viewer.

This seemed like a real story that could happen to real people.

Sheen plays a greed driven stock broker, who is a bit of a sexist pig as well. He then finds his inner feminine side, and finds love with Angie Harmon (aided greatly by Harris), as he takes over an advice column from his ex lover, played by Denise Richards.

1696889,3,B0000640RV,"In this 2001 romantic comedy, an insensitive self-help columnist becomes famous when her out-of-work boyfriend starts writing her column for her. It's a promising setup, but falls short of it's potential. Unlike ""Just Write"", a starless film with a hokey set piece that somehow becomes more than the sum of its parts, ""Good Advice"" fails to convince. Charlie Sheen is handsome as boyfriend Ryan Turner, but although he's brought low in the setup, the defeat he suffers is shallow, entirely not his own fault. As a result, we don't root as hard for him to rise again - which the plot cleverly has him do as the surprisingly wise advice columnist of Page Hensen's (Angie Harmon) shoestring newspaper operation. Sheen is handsome and Harmon gorgeous, but where's the juice? To be honest I was more attracted to the seventy-year-old orange-haired secretary. At least she added some spark to situations.

It still could have worked, but the mechanical interaction between Sheen and Harmon killed the possibility. ""Just Write"" overcame its hokey set piece, but ""Good Advice"", while charming at times, never rises to the level of believability. High points: Roseanne Arquette and Jon Lovitz as Barry and Cathy Sherman.

1696890,2,B0000640RV,"In GOOD ADVICE, director Steve Rash presents a view of upper class urban life that is supposed to be funny in a slapstick sort of way but quickly enough morphs into the world of fairy tales that is unified only by the most unlikely concatenations of events. Charley Sheen reprises his WALL STREET role as an upward bound stock broker who, in this film, has learned that humor can be the leavening agent to success that was denied him by his earlier confrontations with Gordon Gekko. Sheen has a live in girlfriend (Denise Richards) who comes across as exactly the sort of blonde bimbo airhead who has little success as a girlfriend and less as a lonelyhearts advice columnist. Richards dumps Sheen because he has lost his job in a manner that draws uncomfortable dramatic parallels with his previous WALL STREET role. He becomes boozy, depressed, and frankly not a little pathetic in his slovenliness. After Richards exits for Brazil, Sheen needs a job. Then he gets a bright idea. Why not take over hers? First, he must convince Richards' boss (Angie Harmon), who can't make up her mind whether to toss Sheen out of her office or into her bed. At this point, GOOD ADVICE has already crossed the line into a Drew Barrymore fairy tale where things and events always break exactly right for all concerned. I kept waiting for reality to intrude. When Harmon pays Sheen with a paycheck for his columns that she thinks Richards is writing, I wondered when he would ask her to write the check in his own name since he could not cash checks in Richards' name. Jon Lovitz and Roseanna Arquette are only props for Sheen to bounce off of. Estelle Harris is more amusing as an oversexed septuagenerian who saves the day. Not for one moment did I accept the plot premise that Angie Harmon might not fall for the manly charms of Charley Sheen, but then again, in light fluffy romantic comedies like GOOD ADVICE, all that is required to maintain viewer interest is for the cast to pretend that they like each other, or failing that, hate each other. GOOD ADVICE does the former to such an extent that the lack of the latter is hardly noticed. It is not likely that one would want to view GOOD ADVICE more than once. Take my good advice for what it is worth.",1155254400,3,2243,4.568238213399503
1696891,3,B0000640RV,"Though this isn't one of Charlie's best, he actually does a decent job of portraying a high-power investor turned love struck, sensitive columnist.

1696892,5,B0000640RV,"Before I saw this movie, I had my doubts right off. I was wondering why the reviews for this movie were so bad. I thought, ""Do I really want to waste money on a movie that I won't enjoy?"" But being a die hard fan of Charlie Sheen ever since I saw him as the football jock in Lucas, I took a chance. So I spent my money and here is my opinion of GOOD ADVICE.

First of all, the supporting cast is hysterical! Jon Lovitz and Rosanna Arquette as a married couple. He plays Barry, a plastic surgeon and she is Kathy, his money hungry wife. Estelle Harris plays Iris, a sweet old lady who works at the paper. Ex Melrose Place alumn Lisa Rinna has a bit part as Veronica Simpson, the wife of newspaper mogul Donald Simpson.

The plot is very simple. We meet Ryan Turner (Sheen) who loses a successful job due to insider trading. He is to much of a risk to go work for one of his competators, so he is out of a job. Turner's girlfriend (Richards) is bored and unhappy at her job. She writes for her own advice column, ""Ask Cindy."" Without telling her boss, or her best friend, Cindy boards a plane to Brazil and no one except Ryan knows she's gone. In need of a paycheck, he assume's Cindy's identity and takes over her column. Ryan is also falling head over heels with Cindy's editor, Paige. (Harmon) In time, everyone is asking ""Where is Cindy?"" Finally, thanks to Ryan, he has turned this fading column into a popular paper. Now, Cindy returns and the sparks are about to fly! I was not disappointed at all with this movie. It was funny, sweet, romantic, sexy, and smart. With Charlie Sheen, Angie Harmon, and Denise Richards as your leads, you can't go wrong!!!",1123027200,15,1658,4.310897435897436
1696893,4,B0000640RV,"This movie turned out to be like a wart for me. It wasn't really wanted or asked for. But it kind of grew on me. Charlie Sheen is believable and charming as a big time Wall Street trader who loses his job, his girl (Denise Richards), and his possessions after making a huge and costly trading mistake. In the wake of being dumped by Denise Richards, Sheen finds solice in assuming the identity of Richards, who before her departure, was an advice columnist for a small time New York paper. He uses her job to pay the bills and find himself, all the while pretending to be Richards. It's a love story/comedy. It's a clean and cute film that the whole family can watch. I definitley reccommend it. Jon Lovitz and the gorgeous Angie Harmon make the cast even stronger, and even funnier.",1121731200,3,783,4.4825174825174825
1696894,5,B0000640RV,"This movie was both entertaining and at times, hilarious.  Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper.  Also, Jon Lovitz is hysterical as Sheen's plastic surgeon best friend.  This movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor.  I highly recommend it.",1110412800,4,414,5.134328358208955
1696895,5,B0000640RV,A very fun movie. Charlie is great. Angie Harmon is the one to watch here though. Wonderful.,1108512000,3,92,4.470588235294118

1696897,5,B0000640RV,"This is a very funny movie and I highly recommend it. Watching Charlie Sheen's facial expressions during the ""Butt-Artist"" scene made me laugh out loud. Loved the chemistry between the two lead actors. This is a movie where everyone in the end truly gets what they deserve. I think this movie will pleasantly surprise you with its humor.",1091577600,2,337,4.827586206896552
1696898,4,B0000640RV,"I bought this movie primarily because it featured Charlie Sheen, who is a top-flight actor who usually picks decent scripts. I was not disappointed. This is a fun and sassy show with a good story and slightly implausible but satisfying finish. Well acted and scripted and loaded with laughs. Warm and lighthearted comedy at its finest. Definitely recommended.",1084665600,2,359,5.206896551724138

Charlie Sheen is not, usually, a top draw, but all characters work together to make this a really great film.  Up there next to Blazing Saddles, and Annie Hall, etc, sort of anyway.",1494288000,,299,4.4
