2634561,4,B000HD1MTS,"If you have been practicing yoga for awhile, this is a great dvd for days when you don't want to work that hard. The teacher is not in voiceover. It has 4 sections.
Section 1: Begins lying down with conscious breathing. Roll up to standing with half salutes. Side stretches.  Full salutes, about 4.

Section 2: Chair pose, yogic pushups, warrior 1, 2, triangle, extended side angle, twists, abs leg lifts, yogic squat.

Section 3: Moving bridge pose, bridge with hands clasped or upward facing bow, bow pose, locust pose, child's pose to slight back bend in rock pose. Camel pose.

Section 4: supine leg stretches, twists, one legged seated stretches, cows face pose, pigeon, deep relaxation.

All in all a good, simple yoga program.  My only complaint and the 4 stars rating is the music which was obtrusive, at time.  Otherwise a very nice addition to my yoga library. Note: the pose on the cover is NOT included in the routine.",1282348800,3,930,4.703703703703703
2634562,5,B000HD1MTS,"I own several yoga instruction DVDs, and this is my favorite.
Unlike some other series with lot more limited routines, this one has wide enough variety of poses available, and they really address pretty much every part of the body.
And unlike other routines, that feel too stuffy, rigid and 'non-fun' to pay attention to, this one is presented in flowing and logical sequences, that is easy and fun to follow.
The tempo is sometimes little too fast for me, but hey, that's what Pause button is for, and I use it a lot.  Not just to hold the different positions longer and repeat them more often, but the variety and sheer number of poses also inspire me to stop and stretch in many different ways in-between the presented routines, so most of the time each 10 minutes (well, more like 12-13 minute) recorded segment takes me half an hour or longer to go through.
And I love it!
Def highly recommended!!",1268179200,6,902,4.567901234567901
2634563,5,B000HD1MTS,"Best yoga DVD I own. She's clear, posed and the routines (10-15 min. each) are adaptable to dif. levels and so effective.",1261699200,,121,4.545454545454546
2634564,3,B000HD1MTS,"I don't know if I got a defective DVD or not but the sound was very poor. In addition, the DVD went right from one section to the other without stopping. So you didn't realize you were doing more than one workout.

I'm used to Power Yoga so for me this was very tame and, while good stretching, not much of a workout. I also didn't like the instructor. She had no personality and if you weren't watching, you are not always sure what to do.

While I see many people like this DVD, I did not.

2634565,5,B000HD1MTS,"You'll have to be quite agile to get the most of this excellent Perfect in 10 Yoga DVD. If you're really stiff, go for something easier. Even though you'll get benefit from working at your own level, it won't be as enjoyable. Susan Grant is marvelous, with a lovely soft voice that adds to the relaxation of these workouts, and she really understands the flow of how to put the movements together to make for a perfect 10 minute session. Ultra slender, lithe and limber, Susan can bend her legs like a pretzel, and is a marvel to watch.

The 4 sessions make a super start to your morning, but would also be good as an early afternoon ""pick me up,"" in that 2 PM hour that tends to be the hardest to get through. Especially #3, which has the ""Cobra"" pose, which is meant to stimulate the body and mind. #3 is my favorite, with the other 3 workouts kept for variety, to keep the exercise program fresh, and my body used to the other movements.

There is deep stretching in these movements that you can feel to the core of your body, and it feels great! This is very much authentic yoga, not watered down and mixed with other systems of exercise. Other than the 4 workouts, there is a Welcome that is an overview of the workouts, with some added pointers and good suggestions like being ""conscious of the presence while you breathe,"" and there is a wonderful 5 minute Deep Relaxation meditation/resting poses to end with. Well produced in the lovely bare studio of the Morocco Academy of Middle Eastern Dance in NYC, the music adds to the serenity and is by various artists, including Karl Kalbaugh and Chee Wei Tay.",1237507200,6,1612,4.461016949152542
2634566,5,B000HD1MTS,"I am a beginner, and this is concise and easy to follow. I tried another DVD that was hard to follow and complicated-this one is just what I was looking for. It relaxes me in some parts, challenges me in others. I feel so good after doing even just one 10 minute segment.",1236038400,3,271,4.132075471698113
2634567,5,B000HD1MTS,"I love this video. Susan Grant's cues are excellent, and the pace is perfect for me. The short segments  are great when I don't have time for a full workout. If I do have extra time, after doing one segment, I always want to do more - it is very positive and energizing. I would not recommend this video for absolute beginners, because if you don't know basics & modifications, you could get hurt trying some of these poses/moves. I have been slowly learning & practicing yoga, mostly from books and videos, over about a 2 year period and from this video I learned some great variations on poses that have really enhanced my practice.",1199232000,21,634,4.51304347826087
2634568,3,B000HD1MTS,"First, I've done a couple of the segments on the DVD, and they were both longer than 10 minutes (around 13 minutes or so) - not a huge deal, but why would they specifically name it ""10-minute Workouts?""  Second, the instructor is obviously very experienced and flexible, and doesn't offer many modifications for those of us who are not all that flexible.  It seems that she just assumes everyone watching can keep up with her.  Also, sometimes the video quality is not all that good.",1174003200,14,483,4.658823529411765
2634569,4,B000HD1MTS,"I have been trying to find a yoga DVD that is broken in short segements so that I can slowly try to incorporate yoga for flexibility training.  I have some experience but am a beginner.  What I wanted most was a morning routine that included sun salutations so I could easily follow along.  That is exactly what I found.  I purchased this DVD for the ""awaken and energize"" segment and it's what I was looking for--a 10 minute segment of breathing, streching, and sun salutations.

Susan Grant is easy to follow, she cues well enough so I'm not constantly looking at the TV and can instead focus on my form.  There's some voice-over narration for extra information along with the occasional inset to show modifications.  The set is sparse but does not detract from the workout.  I've only done the first segment but I've previewed the entire disc and plan on trying the other workouts at some point.  Thus far, I'm pleased with the disc and look forward to using it frequently.",1173657600,21,976,4.627906976744186

8138743,5,B000HD1MTS,"Love using this yoga DVD. I've purchased some from Target, Marshalls and HomeGoods but couldn't find one I liked. The breakdown sessions and training is amazing. I'm in love with the closing 10 minute ""regroup"" helps with mental stress and anxiety. Body was sore after my first use. I""m a fan three times a week routine.",1457654400,,320,4.732142857142857
8138744,2,B000HD1MTS,"""Perfect in 10 Stretch"" is an excellent DVD, and I bought this yoga one hoping for something similar. I find it hard to follow, though. Maybe I'm too picky, but I consider it a basic requirement of an exercise video (or a live class for that matter) that the narration should enable you to do the same thing as the instructor at the same time. Susan Grant often does not say what she is doing until she has started the movement or has actually done it. If you are in a position where you can't see the video it is hard to know when to change to the next movement, and by the time you glance at the screen she is doing something entirely different. Yoga is not meant to be irritating, so this one is not for me.",1454544000,,710,4.115107913669065
8138745,5,B000HD1MTS,"I keep going back to this Yoga DVD and find it easy for the most part.  You have to be flexible to do some of the poses, as there is not a lot of variation.  However, after I do one or two workouts, I am calm.  The main reason why I practice Yoga, is to de-stress.  Susan Grant leads a De-Stress workout which really does work.  The only negative comment I have, is that Susan does not mention the name of every pose, which I had to look up some of the poses, because I wanted to know their names.  One of my favorite poses she teaches is the Garland pose.  However, you must be flexible to do the full range of the pose. Susan is not energetic, she is calm; I have no problem with that.  There are 4 workouts on the DVD.  The most difficult workout is the Tone and Strengthen; I have to do variations of some of the poses in that workout, as I have bad knees.  Other than that, I really like this DVD overall.  The more one practices Yoga, the more benefits will take place; that is true with this DVD to see results.",1452384000,,1018,4.04
8138746,5,B000HD1MTS,"I bought this because I wore out my old copy of this DVD, so obviously it's working for me.  This is not for someone brand new to yoga.  It is more of a beginner-intermediate level.  Some of the poses are a little too much for an older person like me, but I use 3 out of 4 of the workouts often.  The fifth workout is a relaxation exercise and is a good example for a 10-minute relaxation.",1437955200,,389,4.012987012987013
8138747,5,B000HD1MTS,I bought this DVD because in is fairly easy and is similar to the workout that one of my Yoga teachers does at my classes. You can use all or parts of this hence 10 minutes.,1408147200,,173,3.8333333333333335
8138748,5,B000HD1MTS,"This DVD is for you if you want to do yoga, but don`t have time to do it for 30 or 60 min. This DVD has diffrent workouts to chose from, so you can do a short yoga workout every day of the week, all it takes is 10 min. of your day.",1397260800,,231,3.3773584905660377
8138749,3,B000HD1MTS,"Boring.  This is one of the few yoga DVDs that I bought, used, and then gave away.  I liked the idea of 10-minute sessions, but the teacher was boring in her instruction, and sometimes, the poses emphasized flexibility with no modifications. There are much better DVDs out there.  There was no appeal to it for me to practice with it a second time, so to be generous, I'm giving it three stars instead of two.",1381449600,,409,4.426666666666667
