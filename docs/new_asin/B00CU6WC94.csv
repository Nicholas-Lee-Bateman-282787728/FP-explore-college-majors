5741675,4,B00CU6WC94,"Ok I have to agree that Part 2 is definitely not nearly as good as Part 1. However Part 2's good side is that it explores the deep changes within our main character Shu quite a bit and some tragic things do happen here and there. I really did appreciate Part 2 after finishing it. While watching the first few episodes of Part 2, it really did bug me how the story started to drop a bit. Overall I'd say the anime is in my top 5 favorites, I would give the series an 8.5/10 and I absolutely love the characters. But as far as ONLY Part 2, I would give it a 3.5/5, however I rounded up as you can see. Having seen Part 1, Part 2 is pretty much a must see anyways.",1371081600,6,662,3.911111111111111
5741676,4,B00CU6WC94,"Right off the bat I will say this, I don't think the second part of the series is nearly as good as the first part. That being said I didn't find it terrible. I understand why some people have issues with it but I don't think it's any reason to stray away from the series.

With any show we are going to have characters make choices we don't want to make, and this happens a lot in the second part, but it makes sense. Every action that the characters make, it makes sense. You may be left in the dark for a bit on why they made it, but it all comes together in an almost suspense/mystery kind of way. Overall it worked.

Enough on that. The show picks up right after the first series ends. Our main protagonist (Shu) has stopped the plight, for the moment. But of course everything goes to hell and bonds are tested and friendships are shattered. Characters undergo traumatic events and are sometimes changed for the worst. But as this all happens I found myself understanding why, sure I may have gotten upset over what was happening, but it made sense.

As before the art and music is top notch, and the story threw me for a bit of loop at the end and I didn't actually expect the outcome that happened. If you already finished the first part I urge you to finish the second part. As I stated in the last review, take the show for what it is, when everything is said and done I found myself actually enjoying the show!",1370563200,4,1421,4.2555555555555555
5741677,1,B00CU6WC94,"NOTHING upsets me more than lost potential, especially in a written work. So many characters and concepts left unexplored, so many opportunities missed, so many questions unanswered.

Guilty Crown's entire existence is lost potential, which probably explains why most of my time watching it either had me rolling laughing or pulling my hair out. When this thing was coming out, it was the most anticipated work of that anime season, and quickly turned into the greatest flop of both 2011 (when it started airing) and 2012 (when it stopped). That is quite the accomplishment. Don't believe me? Ask any anime blog that was covering it as it was airing.

10 years prior to the story, the Apocalypse Virus wreaked havoc on the population of Japan in a catastrophic event known as Lost Christmas (which is in no way related to Second Impact from Evangelion shut up how could you say that). Shortly after, Japan was taken over by a branch of the UN called GHQ and went under pretty much a dictatorship. The plot of the main story follows ""milk-toast Shinji Ikari clone Mk. 289"" Shu Ouma, who is dragged into a civil conflict between this overbearing big brother organization and a local group of terrorists called Funeral Parlor, led by the charismatically bland Gai Tsutsugami. He is led to this conflict by ""blank expression Rei Ayanami clone Model 562"" Inori Yuzuriha, a well known singer who for some reason has not been arrested for working with a terrorist group despite apparently making several public appearances and completing missions in an impossibly flowing dress that may as well just be there to give cosplay enthusiasts a challenge and character designers a hard-on, but otherwise has no functionality for RUNNING AWAY FROM GIANT GUARD ROBOTS. Shu also receives the ability of the Void Genome, which allows him to pull ""Voids"" out of people, which are basically physical representations of people's minds in weapon form. Does Shu have more of a connection to the events of Lost Christmas than he realizes? What are the secrets of the Voids and their connection to the Apocalypse Virus? Why is Inori so expressionless all the time? You'll be surprised how little you care by the end of the series!

Now, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of upsides in this show. The character designs, music, and animation are all fantastic, which would be fine if this were simply an artbook or a soundtrack. But this is supposed to be a story, and regrettably, the place where it falls short the most is with the plot and characters, which makes the effort put into the aforementioned GOOD aspects of the show all the more frustrating. You are not going to like ANYONE in this show by the time it is over, especially the main characters. The romance makes no sense, including main couple (remember that Shinji/Rei parallel I made? Well, subtract the actual development that pair had and fill it in with about 10x more squick), plot threads are rushed before being properly explored, side characters essentially become props (unless they end up dead, in which case they become martyrs...unless they're brought back for drama's sake), the Void thing is horribly inconsistent from person to person, and the ending leaves more awful implications than the beginning did because of how little it resolves. Besides Evangelion, it copies several other shows, along with PRETENTIOUS CHRISTIAN SYMBOLISM that serves absolutely no purpose. Nevermind that the show is shorter than the average anime shows, likely contributing to its awful pacing.

Simply put, if you're looking into a writing career and feel like a challenge as to how to fix a story that is fundamentally broken, pick this up. If you're willing to turn your brain off and just enjoy the visuals and music, give it a go. But if you're critically minded in ANY WAY AT ALL, avoid, avoid, avoid.",1369785600,26,3845,4.892638036809816

The artwork, story, score, and english dub are all 5 stars. This is one of those series that comes along every once in a great while that just breaks away from the traditional mold, and it definitely shows. This series is a must have for any fans of series like Evangelion, this story is so much deeper than what you see on the surface and is worth re watching to catch things missed the first time around.

In Guilty Crown Part 2, the anime series only progresses more in terms of character development and so much is revealed that don't even know where to start. There is an establishment of what the past was like and how it all joined to the present but also it shows that with new changes happening a future that is bright can happen.

Even so the second half gets darker and more philosophical. If your not much for anime endings that are not happy then perhaps this is not a series for you. But then again Guilty Crown was never a super cheerful series. I mean it does have a name such as Guilty Crown. It was meant to be a mature and hardcore science fiction anime series with traces of philosophical undertones and not so much a love story despite the intriguing characters. So turning tragic was foreseeable.

This is a series that is available from FUNimation Entertainment both in subbed and dubbed versions. The Sub is my favorite. After all, there is the soft and delicate performance of Ai Kayano as Inori. Then Yuki Kaji voices Shu Ouma who I find to be most entertaining. Ai Kayano also voices Mana. In the Dubbed version there is Austin Tindle who voices Shu and he does give an equal performance to that of Yuki Kaji's. In this anime set he even talks about how demanding it can be to voice act Shu's more action orientated scenes in Guilty Crown alongside a fellow voice actor. This is in the Special On-Disc Extras commentary track. While Alexis Tipton does just as quiet display for Inori as Ai Kayano. Honestly Guilty Crown is a series where FUNimation has got both the subbed version available but also a worthy dub for the series. This is especially important for a series of Guilty Crown's stature. One anime series you do not want to have missed seeing. A beautiful series and a legendary anime series. Just take a look at the animation and music in Guilty Crown.

5741709,1,B00CU6WC94,"What a complete mess.  While the first part of Guilty Crown is solid, not great but certainly had legs to stand on, part two literally slices off those legs from the kneecaps.  I haven't seen a piece of media spin in general, not restricted to the realm of anime, spin so out of control into a terrible mess of plot, cliches, and horrible characterization.  This is how to not end a show, ever.  Don't buy this, pretend it never happened, and go watch something else.  The only redeeming quality in this release is great picture and audio.  So if you want to watch something that looks pretty and is horrible at the same time, here it is, look no farther than Guilty Crown Part 2.",1391558400,6,680,4.4

This series is for people who pay attention - there is a lot of going on in each episode. What I loved about the series is that each episode is exciting and always has a dramatic climax. This show is not for everyone - don't expect your typical high school anime show. There are shocking and depressing moments.

REVIEW:
Not as good as the first part although I understand funding was short. I still love the series either way and recommend it to anyone. I'm not going to be harsh.

The main complaint I have with this anime is the music talents... i didn't care for the music at all, especially the choice of singer. I find her voice completely annoying as if she's literally trying to sound horrible and irritating.

The premise is interesting but i don't feel the pacing was great or that the realization of the virus or void graphics were compelling at all. The graphics of the viral crystals or the void silvery threads were too bland and homogenous looking and lacked visual punch or contrast and when that is married to the overall romantic softness of the world look it all comes off bland.",1381363200,,785,4.6

I watched the video where the three creators talked about how they want to make original anime series and make them as good a production as a hollywood movie and have a moving story that you walk away from and feel something for the work and the characters....well they should probably learn the key to success is a HAPPY ENDING not this BS! I'm sorry but I get real sick and tired of feeling for the characters and getting involved in the story just to have it end the way it did. Not going to ruin the ending with any spoilers or anything but seriously WTF! I'm a little bit annoyed at how many anime series do this....suck you in, get you to feel for the characters and their plight and make you want them to have a happy ending and have things work out (best part about fiction is the happy ending IMHO as happy endings don't exist that often in the real world so at least in the fiction world they can/should give a little ray of hope to viewers who love the work and that's why MOST every successful movie/show has a happy ending and people like them because of that) By leaving this show off the way they did I feel robbed and just feel crappy about what happened to the main characters....great animation quality, unique story line and world they created but next time if you guys make a show...make it right and not this sad drama ending crap that most people don't want to relate to as it's painful and makes us want to just forget the show ever existed.",1378512000,5,1670,4.287974683544304
