2658817,5,B000ILYZ2K,"Beautifully filmed, with lots of flyovers of formations, and an excellent and balanced examination of the subject. Most mainstream documentaries, such as those I have seen from Fox, Sky & the Discovery Channel, tend to concentrate on the hoaxers as though it is they who are the centre of the story, while speaking only to the more wild-eyed elements of those supporting the other side of the story. The nearly-cleverly-hidden negative bias in all such mainstream documentaries has a very obvious aim: to discredit the genuine phenomena in the eyes of the general public. It is unfortunate that documentaries such as this one will not be seen by the vast majority of the public, but then, it is even more unfortunate that we live in a world where governments go to such lengths to hide the truth of such matters from the public. That they do go to great lengths is undeniable; that there is obviously a reason for this expenditure of time, effort & OUR money is evidenced very simply by the fact that they DO go to great lengths to keep the public in the dark. I urge you to watch this documentary for a view of the phenomena you will not see from any mainstream media source. It is absolutely beyond doubt that there are genuine crop formations that cannot be created by human hands. For instance, the staggering ""Milk Hill"" formation which appeared in Wiltshire in August 2001 consisted of 409 circles; given the time frame in which it appeared hoaxers (who themselves claimed to have only 4 hours to work) would have had to complete a circle every 30 seconds. This is without any measuring, marking or checking. And all without breaking one single stem of a single plant.

This point is the single most devastating answer to all the insincere ""hoaxers"", and all the rest of the liars and idiots who support governments in their attempts to pull the wool over the eyes of the world. For no human-made crop circles contain this feature - the comparatively pathetic human-made formations are created by flattening down the plants with a board. Genuine formations are created in such a way that the plants are bent over, not flattened, and the bends are somehow molecularly altered & healed. The growth rate of the plants within genuine formations has been conclusively shown by Dr. W. C. Levengood to be significantly increased, the plants significantly more productive, and their seeds, despite appearing different from ""normal"" seeds, somehow smaller and drier looking, again produce superior plants. Additionally, the plants close to the formation and for a distance which decreases linearly around the formation also exhibit increased growth over more distant plants. And not only are the plants bent over rather than trampled, they are intricately interwoven in amazing ways, almost as though every single plant stem had been individually placed, and yet still undamaged.

There are other anomalies to be found in genuine crop formations which are not present in human-made ones. There are magnetic particles of unknown composition found in the soil; there are magnetic disturbances which make compass needles swing wildly; there are possibly even related aerial phenomena - in 1987 the pilot of an RAF Harrier flying on autopilot was found dead, ejected from his plane momentarily before it changed course and flew over the centre of three formations and then continued on course for another 300 miles before crashing out to sea west of Wales. There seem to be disturbances in the speed of light within freshly-made genuine formations which lead to the creation of ghost images on photographs taken within the formation; some forward-thinking scientists believe these disturbances could also be related to the disturbances in the magnetic field, for it seems increasingly apparent to them that light, far from travelling at a constant speed, will accelerate constantly until acted upon by gravitational and/or magnetic forces. That cameras often refuse to work in, around and over formations, and that batteries often die and other electrical equipment goes haywire is further evidence of the strange energetic disturbances associated with genuine formations.

Additional features of genuine formations are the apparent speed with which they are created; the famous ""Julia Set"" formation right next to Stonehenge appeared in broad daylight within a time-frame of 45 minutes. To suggest that this amazing formation, 400 feet across and consisting of 151 circles, could be created by a team of hoaxers in (maximum) 45 minutes by trampling down the crops with wooden boards (without damaging the plants) in full view of the guards at Stonehenge only 100 meters away, the pilot & cameraman of a plane who flew over the area minutes before it appeared, and the public on the road past Stonehenge is simply ridiculous. There are many witnesses to the creation of formations within minutes, often accompanied by strange ""balls of light"" which have also been caught on video camera. These apparently intelligent, or intelligently-guided, devices (whatever they are) have often been seen just before and just after the creation of formations, and could well be the actual creators of the formations. Where they come from, and who guides them, are questions neither I, nor anyone else, can answer.

And is it not slightly ironic that our government itself has conclusively debunked the claims of those inadequate and insincere liars who claim to be the authors of many of the genuine works of unique and amazingly beautiful art? The official explanation for crop circles, according to the government, is that they are a meteorological phenomena; they are therefore officially not made by human hands. I would like to extend my thanks to the government on this occasion for introducing me to a genuinely new experience - on this one subject I am in complete agreement with them!

All this and more is outlined in detail in the documentary. Nearly 4 hours in total length, it is one of the best on the subject. See also Crop Circles: Quest For Truth.",1295308800,9,6044,5.033966033966034
2658818,5,B000ILYZ2K,Crossover from Another Dimension is a wonderful video either for an introduction to crop circles or for those seeking more information on this topic. I have watched it several times and would recommend this to anyone.,1267574400,2,217,5.055555555555555
2658819,5,B000ILYZ2K,"I just saw this and it is absolutely amazing. EVERY PERSON on the planet should see this documentary! It was well made and thoroughly researched. Terje Toftenes did a great job bringing everything together for a compelling look at the beautiful crop cirles. I am convinced the intelligent beings are out there trying to contact us to let us know that we humans need to get with the program and stop acting so selfish, stop destroying the planet and each other, and start evolving more quickly. It definitely gave me hope for the future of the planet because I know these beings are out there trying to help us.

The crop cirles are great design ideas! I am taking an art class and I just did a design inspired by the crop cirles and everyone in my class just loved it. They are beautiful and magnificent art forms that cannot be found any where else.

I hope to meet the filmmaker one day and thank him for the great job he did on this documentary.",1259625600,3,948,4.411428571428571
2658820,5,B000ILYZ2K,"Crop Circles - Crossovers From Another Dimension (2006)
UFO TV Special Edition - 3 DVD Disc Set
Produced, Directed, and Presented by Terje Toftenes (Pronounced ""Tidy Toftness"")

Introduction:

This documentary was made by Norwegian Terje Toftenes, a producer for 25 years in the fields of industry and finance. It consists of 3 DVD's the first of which is the main documentary itself and the second and third discs contain ""bonus"" material in the form of interviews with prominent crop circle researchers. The production values are excellent and the overall standard is highly professional.

This is the best documentary on crop circles I have ever seen and I consider it essential viewing for anybody interested in this phenomena. Those who are not interested in the phenomena of crop circles should be forced to watch it! Everyone should watch it! The information presented here is profound and incredible and will have any intelligent person in a state of disbelief. I challenge anyone to watch this documentary and still claim all crop formations to be man-made. This program provides irrefutable evidence in my view that there is a superior extra-terrestrial intelligence at work here. Terje Toftenes has created a masterpiece!

Disc 1:

Disc 1 contains a 12 minute ""bonus"" - an introduction to Torje Toftenes himself. This was interesting. What he has to say is fascinating. Here are some examples:

""When I stepped into my first crop circle, well you know it's kind of a cliche to say this but I think my life changed at that moment.""

""It's totally beyond any doubt that this cannot be a huge co-ordinated organised bluff.""

""I'd like to say that the crop circles are the only paranormal phenomenon for everyone to see...""

""I hope this film will contribute to spread information and to gain attraction and to inspire people to find out more about this because I think it's one of the most important things that are going on on this planet at the moment. I think it has something to do with our future, I think it has something to do with the way we treat the planet, the way we treat [the] environment, it has something to do with our consciousness, our state of being, and it certainly has something to do with how we are going to survive into the future. And it has something to do with the whole understanding of life, the universe, and spirit and matter and everything in itself so that is why it's so extremely important to find out more about this.""

Now to the main documentary itself (Running time 1 Hour 15 minutes):

- Hear comments and views of prominent crop circle researchers and visitors to formations (I have listed most of these persons at the end of the review of the documentary).

- See many aerial views of crop formations taken from microlight aircraft which reveal their spectacular geometry and perfect beauty. Many other formations which have appeared are presented in a beautiful way which helps convey the seemingly never-ending variety of shape and pattern.

- See the original news report from 1678 of ""the mowing devil"", believed to be the earliest recorded crop circle report.

- See the ancient monuments in the Wiltshire area of England where most crop circles appear and hear a little about this area:
(i)  Stonehenge: The ancient stone monument which is 4,500 years old
(ii) Avebury Stone Circle: The worlds largest stone circle, 5000 years old, with some stones weighing over 100 tons
(iii)Silbury Hill: The largest prehistoric mound in Europe, 40 metres high, built 4600 years ago for reasons unknown
(iv) West Kennet Long Barrow: A stone tomb some 5 to 6000 years old
(v)  White Horses: Carved on hillsides, best viewed from the air, the oldest at least 2000 years old

- Learn that 98% of crop formations found in England overlay chalk aquifers containing underground water.

- Hear about Doug and Dave who claimed they were responsible for hoaxing all of the circles using ropes and boards. See some man-made formations.

- See physical evidence of a rapid and powerful effect causing expanded nodes and expulsion cavities in crop plants within formations.

- See bent ears of wheat become straightened again. See strange metallic spheroids which appear in the soil of crop formations.

- Hear about the increases of 10-15 times the normal background radiation levels within formations, the improved growth rates of 10-25% in effected crops, the 50% increase in protein levels of wheat, and the effects this mysterious force has on cameras and on people.

- See crop stems which are bent at the base and then all along the rest of the stem there is no damage, no marks, no creases - no evidence to suggest that something physical has been used to flatten the crop.

- See fractal designs in wheat fields. ""Mathematical fractals can only be made with the help of a computer so how can they be created in a crop field?""

- Learn about the amazing mathematical problem known as ""squaring the circle"" which puzzled mathematicians for over 2000 years. It involves creating a square and a circle whose perimeters are equal. This is in fact impossible to achieve with 100% accuracy due to the impossibility of constructing the irrational number pi. Alan Brown has discovered elegant new solutions to the problem within crop circles!

  ""There's a couple of solutions which are not only astonishingly accurate they are astonishingly simple. I'm just amazed that no-one in the 2000 odd years of people studying this problem haven't discovered them... I mean breathtakingly simple.""
  Alan Brown - Designer / Crop Circle Researcher

- More amazing still learn how this relates to the difference in size between the Earth and Moon's radius! Even more remarkable yet is that the same principle is again noticed in Stonehenge in relation to the distance between the inner and outer stone circles!!

- Discover that in the Crooked Soley Formation of August 2002, the same ratios re-appear! It's construction is of the most advanced geometry, consisting of 144 circles around a circle; challenging enough to construct on paper. The formation appeared in the middle of a crop field at night, and the center of the pattern was untouched!!! This  formation not only in total clarity symbolizes the DNA spiral, but also the squaring of the circle AND the relationship between the Earth and Moon by divine numbers. Simply amazing stuff!

  ""To come up with that, a perfect rotating DNA spiral, encoding those numbers is in itself a work of genius, but then to find that in a wheat field in August, there, beautifully formed; and it seems to me the most sane way of dealing with this is to accept that this is a demonstration of a level of intelligence and compassion towards us which is pulling us up.... it's a truly extraordinary bit of intelligence in geometry""
  Alan Brown - Designer / Crop Circle Researcher

- See fantastic video footage of mysterious balls of light (UFO's?) hurtling across the fields where crop circles are. Then see footage of black military helicopters chasing them and hanging around! I counted about 6 different videos from 4 different locations so this is no one-off! First time I've seen this anywhere.

  ""Officially the crop circles are all one big joke, let's all go back to sleep, there's nothing to see, and um if that's the case why are they deploying such high technology... helicopters and personel... to look at this situation... it doesn't make sense... so clearly they know that we know that they know that something is going on""  Charles Mallet - Owner of Silent Circle Cafe - Wiltshire

- See film footage taken by John Wheyleigh at Oliver's Castle in August 1996 ""The creation of a crop circle"". Although some claim the footage was faked you will see a crop circle appear before your eyes in a matter of seconds. Others say the hoax theories are organised debunking as the footage would have a dangerous effect on the public if declared real.  Seeing is believing - decide for yourself!

- Hear about the amazing Chilbolton Event of August 2001 where the image of a face appeared in a wheat field closely followed by a pictogram which some say is a reply to a message beamed into space in 1974 in Binary Code using Puerto Rico's Arecibo Radio telescope. See the original pictogram sent from Earth and the pictogram reply and be amazed at the information contained therein!

""If this is not an extremely clever and well calculated joke conducted by humans is it a serious response from an alien civilization?""  Terje Toftenes

- See the incredible Crabwood Alien Face Pictogram of August 2002 showing an alien being holding an encoded disc containing the following message:

""Beware the bearers of FALSE gifts and their BROKEN PROMISES. Much PAIN but still time. There is GOOD out there. We oppose DECEPTION.""

Learn how the message was decoded and see the IT-Programmer Paul Vigay who did it!

8146081,2,B000ILYZ2K,"After waiting nearly a month for delivery, I eagerly opened the package.  To my chagrin, the 3-disc package contained two copies of disc 2 and none of disc 1.  I viewed disc 2 and found that it consisted of two interviews, one of Michael Glickman, the other of Palden Jenkins.  This was disappointing on two fronts:  (1)  I already have the Glickman interview on a DVD released by Glickman several years ago;  and (2) Jenkins - who I regard as both pompous and pretentious - is one of my least favorite individuals in the crop circle community.  I have yet to view disc 3, but nothing on it could salvage more than a 2-star rating for what was a disappointing purchase.

Since you have to jump through too many hoops to return an item, I'll just write this off as a mistake.",1504656000,,774,4.401408450704225
8146082,5,B000ILYZ2K,"This set of 3 videos is absolutely fascinating and I recommend to any and all who are interested in a serious investigation of the phenomenon known as crop circles, but who are looking for intelligent material (rather than something cheap and weird).

This documentary is full of beautiful footage, intelligent interviews, and covers a lot of research being done by professionals. The viewer will undoubtedly be left with some very important questions to ponder about life as we have come to know it.  Unfortunately, the video itself is not well manufacgtured, and I have had to return it once, and now am returning the replacement.  It is produced by UFO TV and apparently they do not have good equipment (?) am not sure why, but the discs skip and stop and one will not play at all. There are 3 included in this set and all worthy of study.

8146085,5,B000ILYZ2K,"2009 seemed to be the golden year cc docs and this is one that takes the cake.  Pay attention to Glickman, the o.g. of cc interpretation; he cracks me up with his (how are you still not getting it approach to waking the apathetic sheepleness attitude plaguing the collective) kind of humor that only a true communicater could.  The doc itself was done as well as it could've been for the budget usually allotted on a more accurate depiction that ""Crossovers"" brings to the table.  If you want unicorns and glitter watch the history channel so you can be asked a hundred quacktions, whoops, I mean questions (dang auto correct) and out of those hundo you'll get 99 nothings and one disinfo.  But, that's where the scratch is at; scaring the poop out of ya with with fancy haircuts, evil demon aliens from the planet dougndaved, sound bytes from chalkboard harassment, and the incessant need to LIE.
  If you're looking for a closer step toward understanding without clicks and whistles and LIES this is probably it; the narration doesn't make you want to swing kittens by the tail or uppercut your grandma; the marriage of tastefulness and interviews with a deep understanding; decades of research between all the participants that just want you to open your mind and not feed it full of S$@T assumptions then this might be the doc you want to share with that friend whom thinks he/she knows everything and can't accept we have friends in high places that care, don't want our gold, or take our women, molest cattle, rearrange your furniture, be shot at, pat themselves on the back for how much smarter they are, watch every episode of friends back to back with too much salt on the popcorn, or whatever.
