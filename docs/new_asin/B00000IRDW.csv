1227797,5,B00000IRDW,"I've seen a lot of documentaries on artists in my studies of art and photography over the past 10 years.  This piece alone stands out above almost all other documentaries that I've ever had the opportunity to view before.  Calder is the father of the mobile, in terms of school he's the father of the solar system that you'll help your kid learn to make in grade school.

His parents were artists and he studied engineering...only to wind up an artist himself.

You NEED to see this if you have any hope of future in art, you need to know the man who created more works of art in his life time than days he was alive.",1404086400,2,617,4.247863247863248
1227798,5,B00000IRDW,"Alexander Calder is one of those artists you thought you knew - oh, sure, mobiles and all that - but this film will truly engage you.  The story of his unbridle-able creativity comes through every frame.  The photography is excellent, the narration superb, and if you want to know American Art and don't know Calder's story you are missing a huge chunk of it.",1400025600,,359,4.59375
1227799,5,B00000IRDW,"Beautifully made film about one of the great figures of American art of the modern era. Glorious photography and marvelous story telling, this is the kind of film that made the American Masters series so great.

Highly recommended!",1400025600,2,231,5.078947368421052
1227800,5,B00000IRDW,"Well-done overview of Calder, one of the world's most creative artists.  Lots of little-known facts.",1167868800,,100,5.666666666666667
1227801,5,B00000IRDW,"I'm having a hard time returning this gem to Netflix. I'm thinking I'll  have to buy my own copy.  His ""Aha!"" moments, his associations with Mondrian and Miro, his childhood of 78 years, clips of the artist in motion, dancing, creating wire portraits, performing his circus - all this and more.

Calder's friends and neighbors, daughter, grandson, biographer all have something to add to this portrait.

Did I mention great shots of his work?

Five stars",1124582400,,454,4.921052631578948
1227802,4,B00000IRDW,"I have been using this video to introduce Calder to students for several years.  Unlike the other Calder titles available; ""mobile"" and ""circus"" it is much newer, with better music, narration, and more comprehensive information on his life and work.  There are many personal anecdotes about him that can get even the most negative student to smile. You can show this to model mobiles, stabiles, wire sculpture or the idea of professional collaboration. The only drawback is the artistic nudity (including several whimsical penises).",1103068800,10,532,5.321428571428571
1227803,5,B00000IRDW,"I'm a lifelong resident of the Washington, DC area, and through the years I've been to all of the museums in downtown DC from the always exciting Air and Space Museum to the Museum of Natural History to the National Gallery of Art.
One of my favorite, and certainly one of the most recognizable museum pieces anywhere is the gigantic mobile hanging in the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art.  As a kid, I learned it was designed by a man named Alexander Calder, who died before he had a chance to name it.  Many years later in 1998 (what would've been his 100th birthday) I would learn more about Mr. Calder when PBS first aired this American Masters episode, as well as viewing the full exhibit of his work at the National Gallery of Art.
This informative program is a wonderful look at the man who created wonderful pieces of art, and the joy they brought to many art fans around the world.  From the early toys he created as a kid, to his wire scuptures, followed by the mobiles and stabiles he designed in his later years, it is a fascinating biography which includes interviews with his grandson, playwright Arthur Miller, and the Curator of the National Gallery of Art.
If anyone wants an introduction into the life of this amazing man, this is a worthy program to watch.",1003276800,14,1283,4.497854077253219

7911374,5,B00000IRDW,"American Masters honors Alexander Calder with a mix of whimsy and matter-of-fact delivery that ""Sandy"" himself seemed to exude.  Accompanying the viewer's gaze into Calder's life and work, there are endearing stories told by friends and family, a heart warming score, and a chance to see a piece being constructed on site.  One of the last segments in the film takes an in-depth look at the transformation of opinion that took over Grand Rapids, Michigan, shortly after the installation there of Calder's Grande Vitesse.",1511740800,,520,5.178571428571429

7911381,4,B00000IRDW,"Now, I and my wife enjoyed this documentary. However, near the end the producer tried to cast Calder in the role of an anti-Nixon Vietnam war protestor; this to make sure the audience understands that all good artists are allegedly leftists.

In point of fact fact my mother, for example, was a conservative, a Republican and a Republican Party delegate and she voted for Nixon because she hated the Vietnam War, and Nixon ran twice on the promise to end the war. It was principally Democrat Lyndon Johnson who got us deeply involved, in terms of troops, in Vietnam. So why doesn't producer of this documentary tell us what Calder's view on Johnson were? Because your supposed to hate Republicans who wage war, but love Democrats who wage war.",1424044800,,743,4.75968992248062
