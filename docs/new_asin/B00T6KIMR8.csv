7000888,3,B00T6KIMR8,"No doubt everyone agrees that seasons 1 - 3 were the most entertaining of this series, had the best music performances,(just look at all the hot selling CD's that were produced) and more plausible plotlines and much more humor. And the original cast of players were a lot more watchable, there just seem to be too many new students introduced in the past 2 years that were not as charismatic as the initial cast. And some were quite annoying. Seasons 4 and 5 were just a bit less interesting, the main reason was the loss of Cory Monteith (R.I.P) as Finn Hudson but the addition of Adam Lambert for several episodes really helped  in season 5. For these seasons, an appropriate title would be GLEE Will GLEE Will ROCK You !

 It seems that this year, not only are there fewer episodes but there are fewer musical performances than previous years, about 4 per episode, and a lot of them seem to be over produced. The Glee Music Jukebox is the highlight in all the seasons and usually ends up with multiple viewings. Personally I found that the solos, duets and song selections of the past seasons were much better, really miss the vocals of Cory Monteith (Finn Hudson), Mark Salling (Noah 'Puck' Puckerman) and Matthew Morrison (Will Shuster), who hardly does any vocals this season. But we still have Lea Michele (Rachel Berry), Amber Riley (Mercedes Jones), Kevin McHale ( Artie Abrams), Chris Colfer ( Kurt Hummel ), Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina Cohen-Chang ), Heather Morris (Brittany S Pierce), Darren Criss (Blaine Anderson) and Chord Overstreet (Sam Evans)

Unfortunately, about midway through this season, we get to see very little of the regulars as well, replaced by a lot of forgettable performances by new cast members and over produced productions by other Glee competing clubs. We even get to hear Jane Lynch belting out a few songs, including a duet with Carol Burnette (Clang Clang Clang Goes The Trolley). It's not until the finale that we get back on track with Will, Kurt, Blaine, Rachel, Amber and Artie with some great final performances - too bad the rest of the season wasn't this good.

These are the episodes this season.

1 - Loser Like Me
2 - Homecoming
3 - Jagged Little Tapestry
4 - The Hurt Locker: Part 1
5 - The Hurt Locker: Part 2 .
6 - What The World Needs Now
7 - Transitioning
8 - A Wedding
9 - Child Star
10 - The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester
11 - We Built This Glee Club
12 - 2009
13 - Dreams Come True

The Final episode on FOX is a 2 hour show, the first half '2009' goes back to the formation of New Directions, while the concluding hour 'Dreams Come True' moves forward to project where the characters will be in five years and many past cast regulars return. However I found the recap ('2009') disappointing, there's no mention of Finn's role, he only appears in a group performance (' Don't Stop Believin') in the last 2 minutes of the show, and Puck's role is completely ignored, shame on FOX-TV.

Sue Sylvester will finally have her dream come true, the Glee Club 'New Directions' will finally be 'disbanded'.

So it's goodbye to Glee, but at least we still have American Idol.",1424476800,6,3117,4.561717352415027

7000907,5,B00T6KIMR8,"Im a huge glee fan. I was hesitant to buy season 5 because Finn is my favorite character as well as finnchel as my fav couple. But i did. I enjoyed the season because it exceted my expectations. So i then ordered season 6. I was blown away at how they kept the show going without Finn. I think for an important character like Finn...they should have mentioned him more but i was surprised at how intense the season got with the wedding. I won't leave any spoilers but for people that feel the same way...dont worry. The sho2 lives on with kurt and blaine...and brittany and santana....they mend our hearts from the loss of finn, in different ways. Its deffinately worth the buy!! Lots of surprises and happy endings! I do have to say i feel Jesse is an un needed ending. Rachel chose Finn over Jesse because of her extreme love for Finn. Its kind of wrong to have her end up w/ the man that competed w/ Finn for her love. Sam would have been a better choice because of Sam walking in Finns shadow. WOULD have made much more sense. But the show and season 6 is still very worth it ! Long live the glee club!!!!",1467244800,,1109,4.260663507109005

Season 6 you can tell is a shadow of its former glory.  The music is still good but the story is boring and over played.

""The Hurt Locker, Part II""
""Dreams Come True""
""The Winner Takes It All""

7000941,2,B00T6KIMR8,"Watching the sixth and final season of Glee was, unfortunately, something of a painful experience. Not because a show I used to love was coming to an end but because it was ending so badly in so many ways.  The first three seasons of Glee were a true joy to experience, but then things started to stumble in the fourth season when the shows producers made the - in retrospect - bad decision to split the action between the new and continuing generation of Glee kids at McKinley High and the graduated kids who had gone on to try their luck in New York City, with the result that new cast members and their characters got less screen time and never really had much of a chance to make their own mark. The problem only got worse in the fifth season, which not only ended up getting cut to 20 episodes instead of the usual 22 episodes but also had used an unaired Christmas episode from season four which was completely out of synch with the current storylines. And then finally the sixth season came:  late, short (only 13 episodes) and lame, with the show's viewership down over 80% of what it had been in the first few seasons..

As always, there were a few redeeming episodes, or at least episodes that had scenes worth seeing.  In ""The Hurt Locker, Part II"", Sue traps Kurt and Blaine inside a fake elevator where they're tormented by a menacing Sue-puppet on a tricycle (it actually makes Glee-sense when you see it) - truly funny in an outrageously surreal way.  And in the finale episode, ""Dreams Come True"", the scene where Sue and Will do a snarling duet of Abba's ""The Winner Takes It All"" was truly epic, definitely worth catching.  And pretty much every scene with Santana and Brittany - who are about the only characters in the show who seem to have been allowed to grow in any way - are sweet and touching, particularly the episode ""A Wedding"" where they get married in a double wedding with Kurt and Blaine.

The rest, however, is clumsy, tedious and painful. Most of the new Glee kids from seasons four and five simply disappeared without explanation.  The newest Glee members, though talented, never got the chance to take hold and were often shoved into the background by the focus on the old members. And there was way, way too much talking, half of which was Rachel obsessing about her favorite subject, i.e. herself. Most characters were just repeating themselves, with the actors sleep-walking through their roles, relying on schtick rather than any kind of story.

And the most painful moment of all comes in the next-to-last episode, ""2009"" ,where they do a flashback to the end of the first episode of season one, where the original Glee members - Finn, Rachel, Kurt, Mercedes, Tina and Artie -  truly sing together for the first time, with Finn leading the way through Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin' "".  Which only makes you remember how truly great the show _used_ to be and the moments of sheer joy you _used_ to feel, in sharp contrast to what the show has become and the utter lameness of the contrived finale.

Only recommended for a few episodes, with the rest only for true die-hard Glee fans.",1441584000,22,3125,4.590664272890485

7000964,2,B00T6KIMR8,"The final season was really a disappointing one. Each episode seemed like more and more of an insult to the shows fans instead of a celebration. The writing was ridiculous from the first episode until the 12th ""2009"" admittedly was fairly decent and provided some insight but also felt like a ""filler"" episode like so many others. The finale was highly frustrating and absurd in my opinion. I loved the show and the cast of characters but love for this show did not make me blind to its weaknesses. The show was fortunate enough to get 13 episodes to which they could have given each Glee Club Member from Season 1 and 2 a proper send off. Unfortunately, too many where there to support, prop, or praise Rachel. Lead character or not she was not the only one that many fans turned in to see. I personally think it was cruel of how under developed they left so many characters or rushed, destroyed, or just pulled random plots out a black hole to fill those 13 episodes. The music lacked from earlier seasons and most numbers where over produced, didn't really pertain to the matter at hand, and just really didn't seem to have too much of an emotional investment from the singer. So overall I loved Seasons 1-3 loved the back end of Season 5 and thought the writers along with Ryan, Ian and Brad completely destroyed Season 6. Suffering through those final 13 episodes once is more than enough. But I did buy so I could complete the collection.",1438041600,3,1444,4.53639846743295

7000982,3,B00T6KIMR8,"I loved this show when it first aired, it was one of the most fresh, well written and funny at times, sometimes lesson teaching for coping with life as all the good high school set shows do and the Glee writers did it as good as any of them. I've always loved cover songs as well, the cast did them well and I bought all the early season albums and have downloaded a fair number of individual ones from the later seasons as well.  Unfortunately the final season was pretty average, Glee granted did jump the shark a few times in the last couple of seasons, following a decision to graduate most of the cast from high school and not knowing what to really do with most of them after that. But the inclusion of a little kid character, has brought the end to many shows in the past, and I can't comprehend how someone thought it would work on Glee's final season. Obviously they also looked at why the last season wasn't working and blamed the new actors so got rid of them all (except Becca Tobin). This season also has some weird artistic thing going on with drawn sketches appearing after a scene ends to start the next one (possible to come back from a commercial break). That just seemed odd. I can't really explain why I thought the final season was so below expectations without giving away plot spoilers so be aware if you haven't watched Season 6 yet, that I will be giving some stuff away.

The whole concept following Rachel's pilot TV sitcom being reviewed as the worst sitcom in TV history, resulting in Rachel Berry's self esteem being shattered, so she returns to the old high school only to find Sue has got rid of the Glee Club and all other arts programs, converting their old rehearsal hall into a computer lab, just didn't really make sense.  Would you really make enough from a pilot to not have to find employment for a year?  Do you not have to go to university in the US and study some sort of education degree to teach kids?  Likewise Blaine over at his old school, would face the same issues suddenly being the Warblers coach.  Sam being the assistant football coach too?  If Sue shipped off the non graduating Glee kids (with the exception of Kitty) to other schools, why did we not see them compete at sectionals?  The other original school students just hanging out each week at their old school when they are supposed to be highly successful people, where did they get the time? Also Mercedes was supposed to be this big pop star yet she wasn't mobbed wherever she went like would happen when a celebrity comes to a small town.  Plus it was kind of nauseating that everyone just got along after they'd been at each others throats in prior seasons such as Santana when everyone was living in New York.

I found the show wasn't even really pretending to be real or plausible at all with the final season.  Sue being able to hypnotise Sam to do her evil bidding or to fall in love with Rachel when she says a word, by dangling something in front of his face for a few seconds is an obvious example.  Admittedly the whole Saw parody Sue doll on a tricycle was kind of amusing and to be honest maybe one of the highlights of the season, but would a school corridor full of students really not hear two grown men shouting behind fake lift doors?  Plus when they finally do what the puppet asks, Sue is watching a performance on stage so wouldn't see it happen to know they have and let them out anyway.

Sue would certainly at the very least be banned from being around children and schools after contaminating the school's drinking water as well as setting off a car bomb that could have killed countless kids. It's not really possible another school would not fire her after that, they'd be concerned for their own student's safety, or at least the show choir officials ban her students from taking part that year if Sue is still involved.

I'm not sure why they went with the whole transgender episodes, when they covered that issue last season with one of the new students. Plus the Beast was constantly saying how she felt like a woman in conversations where people thought of her as manly in past seasons, so it wasn't consistent behaviour for her to suddenly want to be a dude.  Also the show never explained why the superintendent found Sue's Hurt Locker, why was he in the storage facility in the first place?

Wouldn't Blaine want his own parents, other relatives and friends at his wedding?  I get that Kurt's were already there since his dad was officiating which I guess got an invite for his step mother too, but Blaine's were unlikely to be.  It was such an important part of the plot to get Santana's bigoted grandmother there yet Blaine's family doesn't even come into consideration?

It's was great to see a down syndrome actor get a regular gig on a TV series but in this final season Becky just swears pretty much every word and is completely unlikeable.  The song choices overall were by far the weakest, I have downloaded a couple from The Hurtlocker episode and a few others but usually I download a fair few of from each season and even the ones I don't, most you can sit through.  I ended up fast forwarding a fair few of the songs in this season, especially the final episode which didn't have one good song, starts of with Mr Schuester playing on a ukulele for crying out loud.  In the extras we learn that Darren Criss (Blaine) wrote one of the final episode songs, so the days of the top musical writers were over a long time ago.

The Final Episode was terrible. On the DVD the final two episodes are combined, the first half was like a deleted scenes from season one episodes, but it's obvious it's not as the actors are clearly older, and Rachel has the straight eyebrows mono brow plucked thing going on that she has for the other episodes in this season, whereas when they throw in the old Don't Stop Believing number with Finn, where everyone looks younger, she has the normal looking brows.  We already know the stories of how each character came to want to join the Glee Club, surely something better than that could have been thought of.  The second half five years into the future and they're all still hanging out together, successful in New York.  Sue with the public knowing what she did in earlier this season episodes, is now Vice President.  Come on?

Glee will go down in history as one of the best sitcoms, one of the best high school based dramas, probably the best show ever that has a lot of singing in it, but the final season just wasn't in the same league as the original ones.",1436572800,9,6551,4.45857740585774

7001011,5,B00T6KIMR8,"I love Glee.  Overall Season 6 was very good, probably not my favorite of all the seasons, but It built and and the season was very satisfying.  Hard to see the series end.  Happy that there were sweet and good endings for our favorite characters.  So happy Rachel had her happy ending. Glee was never the same after Finn/Cory died....but life and shows go on, and I think Ryan Murphy made lemonade out of lemons and did justice to the memory of Finn and Cory.  Thanks for a wonderful series filled with love, music, and friendship.  I am a 51 year old Gleek and proud of it!",1435190400,2,575,4.327102803738318

the episodes were very jumpy this season for example what ever did happen to sam & rachels brief romance? it seemed like the writers just burried that story. set overall is a 5 star set though",1432425600,5,329,4.0

7001111,4,B00T6KIMR8,"Have been a fan of the show since the pilot. So, obviously had to get this DVD set to complete the series in my library.

WHERE ARE THE BLOOPERS?! Had they not been advertised, I'd be happy with the special features (both ""The Final Curtain"" and the ""Yearbook"" are fantastic wrap-ups of the entire 6 seasons). But, I feel like something major is missing. Especially because I LOVE blooper reels. You'll still see some behind-the-scenes stuff from the special features, but it's not the same. THEY AREN'T BLOOPERS. Disappointed, but as a big fan of the show, I am still happy to now have the entire series to watch whenever I want.",1431993600,15,1364,4.734177215189874

I know I'm a pre-k teacher and I use music to teach my children, I also enjoy singing and dancing with my kids. Getting back to Glee's final episode, I love that Rachel Berry married Jesse St. James I always thought they were a cute couple and had amazing chemistry, what bought tears to my eyes and touched me so much is when the Superintendent of schools in Ohio made Will the principal of the new William McKinley School of Performing Arts.",1508803200,,728,4.360294117647059

But Season 6 could have gone in a whole other direction, could have been very well center around Marley, Blake,Jake,Kittie ,and Unique. Then bring in a few extras to fill spots .Just didn't make sense to bring in New actors just for the last season. Nothering against them. Yes ,I put alot of thought into this ",1499558400,,437,4.395061728395062
