7813075,5,6301519299,"This is a great movie. Yaphet Kotto and James Woods give stellar performances. And watch for Kene Holliday as one of the militants. Straight out of the gritty '70's when we were all looking for a 'Revolution.' If you can find this, it's vry good one to add to your library.",1440979200,,273,4.372549019607843

7813077,5,6301519299,This movie never made it to DVD. True story of NYPD taken from a well written book authored by the prosecutor. A collector's item with an A list cast.,1393632000,,150,4.206896551724138
7813078,5,6301519299,"I love the squad cars the police officers drove in, weren't they 1970 Plymouth Roadrunners'?
Pam Grier also had an interesting role also!
