However, this one is well put together and has a great storyline that ties back to the original movie and takes on new adventures. It is a great movie for the whole family!

I use to own the DVDs, but have misplaced them overtime. Purchasing the prime video seemed like a great idea, and my son loves watching this movie. He has already watched it multiple times and I can guarantee that we won't ever misplace the movie again.",1464912000,,598,4.155172413793103

75670,3,078885383X,"This is not as good as the original Lilo & Stitch film. For one thing it  has Dakota Fanning instead of Daveigh Chase (who did Lilo in the original and in the TV series). Set between the original film and Stitch: The Movie, it was released later than the series. The film is awkward. Though it is rated PG, I did not find it at all violent. Instead I found the film to be silly. I still think Lilo is ugly. She just does not look attractive to me. It is the type of film for little girls from Hawaii. To me the best part were the aliens Jumpa and Pleakley. Maybe if they were given larger roles I would have liked the film better. Nor do I understand Lilo's obsession with Elvis Presley, but children will get obsessed with something. David Ogden Stiers doing a Russian accent to do an alien doesn't work for me -- it's just wrong. I did like the house Noni and Lilo lived in, with the space alien tower. Also the gags of Noni hiding the hover car were cute. I would have liked the film more if Noni had a bigger role, but I understand the focus is on Lilo. The idea of aliens living in Hawaii is funny and how they manage to hide from other is amusing. However, the film is awkward, not a favorite.",1445040000,2,1199,4.1239316239316235

As an adult, they are good, but my 7-year-old son loves them all.  And the takeaway is that he says family comes first and puts that into practice.

75866,4,078885383X,"Short and to the point (at a brief 68 minutes), this movie is not quite as good as the original.  In this offering, Stitch has nightmares of turning bad.  Instead, he's simply running down due to the fact that his molecules weren't fully `charged' when he was made.  In essence, he's dying.  Meanwhile, Lilo is trying to win a hula contest.  At this point, the exchanges with the evil Mertle have taken on some disturbing implications.  You have this snide and snotty little white girl bullying Lilo.  Everyone knows this and yet it's always Lilo who gets in trouble for responding to these constant attacks.  It's Lilo who gets the lectures and is ordered to show restraint while this vicious little white girl gets to wreck havoc with impunity.  I'm not entirely certain that's a great message to be hammering home in each of these movies.

The hula contest is all but forgotten due to all the side distractions and a rushed rescue mission to save Stitch.

Not quite as happy as the first film.",1418515200,,996,4.634285714285714

Lilo, still a little girl, has a little more growing up to do in order to be the friend Stitch really needs when he faces a life-or-death crisis that neither of them understands. (Dr. Jumba knows considerably more about the situation, but true to his nature he's trying to help while at the same time scrambling to paper the whole thing over.) David also gets laughable advice from Pleakley on how to impress Nani, who once again has the unenviable task of dealing with her bratty little sister and the mayhem Stitch just can't seem to help causing. Knowing Dr. Jumba, the problem with Stitch makes perfect sense, though the resolution steals at least part of a page from E.T. The makers, however, had the good sense to draw it down so it involved only the characters directly affected--there's not a Fed or representative of the Galactic Whatchadoodles in sight. And the animation and backgrounds, if not up to theatrical standards, are still quite captivating (one very nice touch, in one of the more quiet and satisfying scenes, shows how Lilo can configure her bedroom).",1288569600,,1201,4.921182266009852

The Movie</a>.  The mischievous but powerful blue alien construct known to his creator, Dr. Joomba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers), as Experiment 626, and to everyone else as Stitch (Chris Sanders), suddenly begins to have nightmares that feature him doing terrible things.  They prove prophetic when it turns out that during his creation his molecules weren't fully stabilized (thanks to the unexpected intervention of the galactic police), and now he's deteriorating.  Joomba must build a fusion chamber to restore him, but Terran technology isn't up to the job.  Meanwhile Joomba's monocular sidekick Pleakley is attempting, rather ineptly, to coach David Kawena (Jason Scott Lee), with whom Lilo's big sister Nani (Tia Carrere) has recently begun going out, in making her jealous (a distraction I could have done without), and Stitch's seven-year-old buddy Lilo is trying with all her might to originate a new hula that will enable her to win the May Day competition, triumph over her nasty queen-bee rival Myrtle, and recreate her own mother's long-ago triumph.  But Stitch's situation takes precedence, and Lilo must choose whether to sacrifice her ambition or her friend.

76229,4,078885383X,"Like most people, I went through a little stage where I'd immediately scoff at any direct to dvd Disney sequels. You can't blame me- there were TONS being released over the last 6 years, and it seemed like they wanted to beat the Land Before Time sequel record or something. But my daughter showed interest in Lilo & Stitch 2 when she saw a preview for it on an older Disney dvd, so I got it for her. As long as she enjoyed it, that's all that mattered, right? Low and behold, the movie hooked me with the opening scene, and I watched the whole thing with just as much interest as her.

The movie starts out with a fairly dark sequence, and ultra protective parents may have complaints about it. We see Stitch snap, and he goes back to his old destructive ways. He runs around shooting things, crashes his ship into Lilo's house, and even smacks her, leaving two claw scratches on her cheek. It turns out to be a dream, and Lilo wakes him up so they can start the day. Lilo's excited to take part in a hula contest, especially after learning that her mom won it when she was Lilo's age, and gets a picture of her from the competition from the dance school she attends. Unfortunately, Stitch's bad dream turned out to be a warning- he has short episodes where he'll act crazy again, and becomes destructive for a short time. His eyes turn green, and the best way to describe it really is that he has a glitch. Jumba tries to invent something to fix this, but isn't having much luck. At the same time, Lilo's focused on nothing but winning the hula contest, ignoring family issues in the process.

I might get negative votes from people who like to read reviews for things they've already seen and don't understand the 'helpful' part of voting, but I have to say that I liked this sequel a bit more than the first movie. The darker tone, deeper family issues, them actually addressing Lilo's mom, and the fact that the animation was nearly up to par with the original's and not rushed like the Cinderella or Aladdin sequels makes this a winner in every aspect. They even went the extra mile to use 3 Elvis songs here! And because there's mainly one problem, Sitch's glitch, the characters are much more fleshed out this time. The only complaint I have is that there was a little too much comic relief from Pleakley, but maybe that was just me wanting them to go on with the story. Kids will get a kick out of him for sure. This is an excellent movie, and had they upped the budget for the animation just a little bit, it could've easily been a theatrical release. All the voice acting is great, the soundtrack includes Elvis songs (those couldn't have been cheap) and the story have some real heart and soul put into it, which is more than I can say for the majority of animated movies from Disney that hit theaters after the first Lilo & Stitch.

The dvd also has some quick special features that don't take up much time. You get a video by Jump 5 for Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride, which will make you wonder where those kids are now. There are two short games that feature Pleakley and Jumba, nothing special here. But then there's the 'Origin of Stitch' short, which is a bit misleading. We get to see a good number of the other experiments that were made before Stitch, and Stitch gets worried when he sees what he was originally used for. But Jumba comforts him and all goes well. There's not much to this short, and they could've made it a real origin story, showing more than a quick clip of Stitch shooting things in a simulation, but hey, it's more Stitch for the kids.

I can't recommend this movie enough. Fans of Lilo & Stitch should have this in their movie library, especially with how cheap it is now. If you were worried about it being rushed, don't be- it's great. Now I wonder how the other ones are...",1271030400,2,3818,4.396039603960396

(Walt Disney, )
------------------------------------------------------
This is the best of the three sequels to the utterly brilliant ""Lilo And Stitch"": this film recaptures and builds on the charm of the original, and finds a way to have fun with Stitch's chaotic side, even though he became a well-behaved, good little monster at the end of the first film. Stitch's wiring starts to fritz out, causing him to do naughty (and funny!) things, also creating a rift between him and Lilo, who is busy trying to master her own temper. Several themes are pursued here: Lilo working hard to attain a goal, and persisting, even though her chances don't look good; Lilo and Stitch having a big fight, and learning to forgive each other; Stitch wrestling with feelings of guilt about his own bad behavior, feeling that he is a bad person, even though he tries to do the right thing. As with the first movie, this touches on some profound points about human behavior and our inherent imperfection, and like the first film it does so without being preachy or dull. Good writing, good animation, and lots of well-timed humor (Pleakley, in particular, gets some good moments here...)  If you liked the first ""Lilo And Stitch,"" there's a good chance you'll like this one as well.  It's much better than the other sequels.

76233,5,078885383X,"""Lilo and Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch"" is a winner, and in fact, I thought it was better than the first. Adorable little Lilo follows in her late mother's footsteps as she participates in the big island hula contest. Stitch on the other hand, seems to have suffered a glitch which brings back all his penchant for destruction, with some catastrophic results. It's up to the gang - Lilo, Nani, Jumba etc to pitch in and save their little alien friend.

My 4.5 year-old really loves this story, in fact she seems to want to watch it more often than the first Lilo and Stitch. I guess part of it lies in the charm of the story - Lilo trying her best to live up to her late mother's talent as a hula dancer[ and her late mother looks exactly like Lilo when she was young which upped the cute factor!]. And of course, it also explores the theme of friendship as embodied by Lilo and Stitch's relationship.

There are also plenty of extras:
- a bonus video ""The Origin of Stitch"", this tells us where Stitch really originated.
- games and activities, i.e. ""Jumba's Experiment Profiler"" where viewers can help Jumba by testing viewers' knowledge of Jumba's other 625 experiments while viewers help Jumba restore his computer database.
- music and more, Jump 5's music video ""Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride"".
- the language options are English, Spanish, and French.

Conclusion - fans of Lilo and Stitch will find much to appreciate in this second installment, and I must caution that this is quite a tearjerker!",1247788800,,1503,4.642857142857143

76297,5,078885383X,"Before Lilo and Stitch ever came out, I was dazzled by the advance PR pic of Stitch and the Volkswagon. The actual film turned out to be overdone, overlong, rather obious, but still filled with good character design, likeable, if undeveloped characters, and exotic settings like outer space and the Polynesian islands. The worst part was probably the endless blather about searching after Stitch, and the movie doesn't lighten up until the charcters do, which really isn't until the TV series.

But here Disney takes animation about a million miles further than it has gone before, and does so with the simple idea of Less is More. The story may seem like deja vu to an adult, but likely not to a kid, and it echoes everywhere the sort of myths, archetypes, and universal stories that are Disney's forte. But it does so with actual Hawaiian vocabulary, dancing, and singing, and the great characters from the original film, now grown into something substantial. The deft feel continues into the simple, abstract closing titles. The sense, the rhythm, the timing, pacing, mastery, everything that makes animation great, just feels right here. No one expects a sequel to be better than the original film, and direct-to-video is usually nothing to write home about. But here's the exception. Stitch may have a glitch, but Disney has a winner.",1225843200,,1339,4.9511111111111115

76302,5,078885383X,"""Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has A Glitch"" picks up the title as a worthy sequel to the original Disney masterpiece, in the stead of the somewhat-dissapointing ""Stitch! The Movie"". Though this film never made it to theatres for reasons unknown, it goes all the length to reinvigorate the specialness of the original film, supplying us with the original animation and voice cast (with the exception of Dakota Fanning replacing Daveigh Chase as the voice of Lilo...but more on that, in a moment).

L&S2 supplies us with a story that's more of a drama between the characters, rather than the comedic space opera that the original one was. Nonetheless, despite the lack of space battles and Captain Gantu, the film more than qualifies by supplying the viewer a story of Stitch and Lilo's conflict with the blue alien's mysterious malfunctions, filled with many traditional-L&S wittisisms (without falling back on pop culture references), music by Elvis Presley, and touching/amusing/priceless Stitch/Lilo interaction.

Staying true to its originality and presentation is a feat undaunted by switching voice actresses for Lilo; fans need not worry, for Dakota Fanning fills her shoes with all the heart and emotion needed to make her come alive as she did in the original film. Within five minutes of watching the film, viewers will most likely forget to notice the transition, or at least cease to be troubled by it.

Doubtlessly the only true and worthy successor to the original ""Lilo & Stitch"", ""Stitch Has A Glitch"" goes all the way to touch upon the audience the meanings of friendship and Ohana, all whilst ingesting the brash-yet-delicate humor that served to make the original film just so good.

""Lilo & Stitch 2"", plainly said, is a more-than-worthy sequel. All fans of the original film or franchise should be sure to see it.",1157587200,9,1828,5.023102310231023

This movie has everything one would want for L&S stuffs. What's a L&S cartoon without Lilo pounding the crud out of Myrtle? Or Stitch destroying stuff, hissing, biting, and growling? (Baby Stitch is EXTREMELY CUTE!!! Vicious & dangerously adorable! Just like bunnies!)

Family Fun Night by Nani (when she tells Lilo and Stitch to come downstairs and have 'FUN FUN FUN!'- there is a closeup of her face then there's a closeup of the ant monster from the movie- they imply she is scary like the ant monster, very funny :)) is fun to watch and those paper bag bug monster mask/hats Lilo & Stitch wear always make me laugh! :)

Since Lilo is obsessed with winning the hula contest, she becomes extremely selfish and ignores Stitch when he needed her the most. (She was bad to her older sister as well.) She kept thinking Stitch was bad, but really she was the one who was bad. She accused Stitch of being bad no matter what and confused him into great doubt and terrible worry. (She made him suffer really!) He tries to prove himself good to her by doing good deeds. (He even sings! Disney puts a little message in there with him singing 'I Need your Love Tonight' - he really did need her love and support... evil SELFISH Lilo!) He shows her his proud progress with the drawing of him colored in blue (blue means good), but she snaps at him, insults him, and crumples his paper without even looking at it. At this point, he's had enough and is very upset & angry. The fight is kinda funny (Stitch screaming in the background 'SHE BIT ME!!!') and the tamed Stitch once again displays his hostility fairly well (although it was mild compared to his viciousness in the first movie).

There are so many funny good parts all throughout the movie, it's hard to find movies to be like that.

For Lilo's hula theme for the contest, she uses an ancient Hawaiian legend of two friends (borderline lovers though) of a goddess and a handsome mortal. Disney makes it looks like Lilo and Stitch are these two friends by the way they act out the legend for Lilo's hula contest. The male dies (by a sea cliff- same type place where Stitch dies) and the goddess' love brings him back to life. This happens pretty much exactly when Stitch dies (although there was no jealous goddess throwing him into a volcano). Lilo feels horrible knowing she had wronged Stitch by accusing him of being bad on purpose. (Suffering Stitch dies in great sorrow.) I did not expect such a touching loving scene in this movie, it made me love these characters (especially Stitch) even more so. It was so sweet with him putting his claw on her hand when he came back to life. It's cute that Lilo was able to tame and teach crazy vicious little Stitch to love that much. I would say it's regular friendship love, but with that romance legend, Disney seems to imply that the two are a lot more than just friends. (It's Goliath & Elisa all over again!-Gargoyles- with that relationship they don't beat around the bush there!)

Even though it's another different species bonding/love thing- the deepness of Lilo & Stitch's love for each other really can move you and help you to appreciate these characters a lot more than ever thought possible.

It went from Lilo's cute crazy alien pet that liked to bite and hiss to Lilo's 'more than friends' love for Stitch. Wow! I prefer this over E.T. anyday! Stitch is much easier on the eyes than E.T.- he's very fluffy and cute; E.T. is not.",1140393600,2,3673,4.530920060331825
76357,3,078885383X,"It is understandable that there have been many avid fans of `Lilo and Stitch.' The central characters Lilo and Stitch are so charming, and the colorful design against the background of Hawaiian landscape is always fun to see. For all its weak story (by as many as four writers) `Lilo and Stitch 2: Stitch has a Glitch' is a surprise to me because this straight-to-video sequel retains both of the merits of the now popular series.

I don't know why, but Dakota Fanning replaced Daveigh Chase as Lilo's voice. Except that, however, the cast is the same as the 2002 film. This time Stitch has become `ill' and in spite of his better self, begins to wreck havoc in the pastel-colored island again.

In the meanwhile, Lilo enters a hula dance contest. She needs to come up with new dancing, and enlists a help from Stitch to find good material, but she is not yet aware that her best friend is going to have some trouble, which only Dr. Jumba his creator can solve. Plus there is a love story (not much, not good), and there is also a ""comic relief"" from gabby and officious one-eye alien Pleakley, which kids might enjoy watching, but adults may find irritating.

Probably the film's target audience is lower than that of the original, and that may explain the short running time and familiarity of the story. Though the plot is weak, there are some good visuals and funny jokes, with a few musical sections (using lesser known Elvis songs) capturing the fun-loving spirit of Lilo and Stitch, which are delightful to see. Also the principal characters and their friendship are well-described, and as most people watch this sequel for those characters, namely Lilo and Stitch, the results are reasonably entertaining.

The original `Lilo and Stitch' was Disney's in-house animated film that was successful critically and commercially. The well-deserved success has a good reason. For no one would hate the these adorable characters -- hula-dancing little girl and six-legged alien. If Disney is making too many sequels these days, making this one should be justified for giving us another chance to meet again two of them -- Lilo and Stitch.",1136937600,5,2137,4.830601092896175

However, you can really see that different illustrators were used.  The story is also much improved.  However, the ending is just plain dumb and predictable.

I am starting to see a pattern with Disney.  There seems to be two companies.  One company puts out stellar, classic animated movies (such as Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Tarzan, Lilo and Stitch, etc.) -- High quality animation, acting, stories, etc.  Then there is the second company... it puts out Direct to DVD drivel like Stitch the Movie and Tarzan and Jane.  Movies from the second company look no better than Saturday morning cartoons:  wooden animation, acting, etc.

For three fourths of Lilo and Stitch 2, you'd think this movie was made by the first company.  All the same voices were used, and the acting and animation are good.  But the last act just seems to fall apart.  I'd rent this movie if you can, rather than buy it or borrow it from a friend before deciding to make the purchase.",1133481600,,1090,4.698412698412699

THOUGHTS: BAH-BLOODY HUMBUG!This made me never wanna watch L&S ever again! I cried at the end...not because it was sad, It was because I even wasted 68 minutes! Even my cousins hated this mess.

So instead of being supportive through the illness Lilo assumes his behavior is because Stitch is ""bad"". Stitch's own self-esteem plummets because he makes the same assumption. What a sick message!

Then Stitch dies in an overly long scene. He comes back to life, of course, but there is no catharsis from his death, only unnecessary trauma. I'm glad I rented it; my daughter never wanted to see it again.

It's loaded with the spirit of the original and for a direct-to-DVD release, it quite shines. Stitch has a nightmare in which he goes crazy and destroys stuff, but Lilo assures him that it's just a nightmare and he's not bad. Then, Lilo and Stitch arrive late to Lilo's hula class and learn that everybody's being asked to put together a special hula for the island May Day competition. The two decide to work together, but can't seem to get any ideas and their plans are interrupted by Nani's insistence that they join her for the family night she's set up, in which she insists they must have ""fun, fun, fun."" It's there that Stitch shows the first signs of having a glitch. Jumba realizes what's wrong right away, but as Stitch continues to malfunction, Lilo doesn't realize there's something wrong and thinks he's ruining things on purpose. It's a bit hard to watch at times, but believe me, things really come together and this has great ending!

One other thing I should mention is that Elvis is back in full-force here, with three Elvis songs in the movie --- the most memorable being ""A Little Less Conversation.""

""Lilo & Stitch 2"" includes the following bonus features:

- Disney's Fastplay --- this is a feature showing up on pretty much all Disney DVDs these days. This automatically starts up the movie and plays a selection of bonus features. Useful if you'd like to be able to have your kids be able to just pop it in and not have to deal with the menu --- although personally, I prefer to use the menu.

- The Origin of Stitch --- Stitch stumbles upon one of Jumba's secret files containing data on his origins. Although the info is at first disturbing to him, Jumba shows up with some reassuring information.

- Games and Activities --- There are two games -- ""Find Pleakley"" and ""Jumba's Experiment Profiler."" ""Find Pleakley"" is actually kinda hard --- you have to use your remote control to choose Pleakley from a group and if you're not very fast, you'll end up with zero points. You can also choose to play against another person, or Exploration Mode, in which you don't have to worry about a ticking clock.

- Music and More --- Jump5 performs ""Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride,"" interspersed with scenes from the movie. Personally, I quite prefer the original version, but this isn't bad.

- Previews for other shows and movies, including the upcoming ""Leroy and Stitch"" (first I'd heard of it, well, we'll see...),a direct-to-DVD ""Bambi"" sequel (um, okay?) and the TV show ""Kim Possible.""",1128124800,,2612,4.67755991285403

I saw this film yesturday,and I was bewildered. This is modern.

""Lilo And Stitch 2:Stitch Has A Glitch"",may be Disney`s best sequal,against ""Toy Story 2"".

I am so glad this movie is as good as it is. I didn`t like ""Stitch:The Movie"" at all,but the makers of this movie had a huge comeback.

This film continues the spirit of Ohana,and captures the greatness of it`s predesser.

During this Disney production,we introduce Dakota Fanning as the voice of Lilo. I think she has the perfect voice for the part of Lilo.

This is a one-disc DVD with bonus features,previews,an exclusive featurette,""The Orgin Of Stitch"",and much more.

Another bonus feature is teen group Jump5`s music video of their version of the classic Disney song ""Hawwaiin Roller Coaster Ride"".They turn the tune into a rockish,upbeat version. You`ll very much enjoy it!

Also,this DVD contains a preview for the 2006 movie ""Leroy and Stitch"",where Stitch has to leave Earth and his family.

76400,5,078885383X,"I just got through watching this movie....and I still have tears in my eyes. It is such a worthy sequel to the original, those of you who have not seen it yet, please get it as soon as you can. It's so worth the money.

I feared a worthy sequel to the original wouldn't be possible...how could they ever live up to the emotional impact of the original?

But they came VERY close in this one. I don't think you could ask for a better sequel. Everything seems back the way it should be...the story quality, the animation quality, the world of Lilo and Stitch that we first fell in love with is now back, a refreshing change from the animation and story quality of the TV series and Stitch the Movie.

Stitch looks like himself again, the way he was animated and coloured in the original movie, the way we all first got to know and love Stitch. And the emotion in his eyes is back again, something terribly missed in the cheaply-animated series.

The movie is only 68 minutes long but it feels much longer. I only wish that there was more. I pray that they do another movie similar to this one...not the kind done by the TV animation team (leroy and stitch), but a WORTHY sequel...one with the time and love put into it that this one very clearly had.

Now, there are some disturbing moments in the film, but when they occur just bear with it, because things explain themselves rather quickly. I am surprised at Lilo's attitude at a few places in the film, sometimes she isn't nice to stitch at all, but it resolves itself. I had also feared that this movie would have Stitch turning ""bad"" again, and that it'd wreck the character of Stitch.

But it doesnt, it doesn't do that at all. In fact...once the movie is over you find yourself loving Stitch even more than you did before. If that is even possible for some of us. I didn't think i could love Stitch more than I already did because I loved him fully as a die-hard Stitch fan, but I DO love him more after this. The film is deeply moving.

The movie also answers the question, once and for all, of whether Stitch was is evil, which has been a subject of debate for a long time amongst Stitch fans. And fortunately, and much to my relief, the answer is a resounding NO!! So many questions are answered by this movie...questions that have needed answering ever since 2002. Even how Jumba was captured is answered in this film. But we now know that Stitch was not, is not, and never will be, Evil.

The ending is extremely powerful, and until you watch the film, something that none of us would have ever expected to happen in Lilo and Stitch's world. But it makes it more powerful.

Never have I seen a Direct-to-video movie with such quality, such emotional depth, such strength of story and character development.

This movie is theatre-worthy material, award-worthy material and I pray that it does receive awards or at the very least, record-breaking sales. It deserves it. You can tell they took great care in making this movie as good as possible.

The Lilo and Stitch that I fell in love with came back one more time...something I think all Stitch fans really needed to see more of.

Stitch's glitch is nothing trivial. It's really quite serious. And it starts very early in the film. You will be surprised what it leads to, but again, just bear with it.

I want to talk forever about this film but I've said pretty much all I can without spoiling. But hopefully I have provided enough tidbits to get you guys to go ahead and make the purchase. It's worth every single cent paid. If you haven't bought it, don't hestitate to get it, you will be glad you did.

DisneyToon Studios did a wonderful job. I commend them 100% for what they did on this movie. It's such a worthy sequel, and I know that you all will love it too. I am probably the pickiest stitch fan out there when it comes to preserving his character, I've been so vocal about my disagreements with liberties they've taken with him in the series. And I cannot find anything to complain about in Stitch Has A Glitch. I can't. It's that good.

Included in the DVD are the bonus feature: The Secret Origin of Stitch, and the preview for Leroy and Stitch.

Secret Origin of Stitch:

Nothing like the original comic version of Stitch's creation. But still good. Animation is not as well done as the movie itself but that's to be expected. I won't spoil this either, but...it's not bad. It has long been debated whether Stitch was ever truly evil. This short answers it once and for all. And, it will bring tears to your eyes. It's a surprisingly emotional short, and, I'm very glad they included it. It made me cry. Good tears.

Leroy and Stitch:

Very unimpressed with this preview. The way it's done makes it sound like Lilo and Stitch belong apart because their ""mission"" is finished in recovering all the experiments on earth. Did someone forget that Stitch was exiled to earth before the concept of 625 other experiments to catch was ever thought up by the TV animation team? Somebody did, cos this preview treats it like Stitch was only on earth long enough to catch the other experiments.

But, I usually am proven wrong on my fears for the future movies so maybe i will be on Leroy and Stitch as well. But, it doesn't look good so far. View the preview for yourself, on the Sneek Peeks part of the DVD. Draw your own conclusions.

I am so impressed, so moved, so touched by this movie. It truly is the best sequel we could have asked for, the most true to the original, the most respectful of the original work, AND, builds the strength of the characters immensely. You will be surprised. That's all I can say, you will be surprised beyond belief by what you see in this film.

Go get it, as soon as you possibly can.

And remember this new message that the movie drives home:

""Love is more powerful than death""

That is the message of the film, repeated almost as often as ""Ohana means family, family means no one gets left behind"" was in the original film.

So good. That's all I can say. So VERY good. I can't believe a reviewer here rated it one star because of the previews...come on! Buy the DVD version and skip the previews if that's gonna ruin the movie for you. I've never seen a DTV sequel with such high quality and a 1 star rating for this one is highly undeserved!!",1126396800,2,6302,4.42523768366465

  Basically, I was happy that the animation wasn't the cheaper TV show quality, and more work went into the story, which really surprised me.  I guess they realized that Stitch is a big favorite with adults too!
  Many of the other posts have done a good job summarizing the story, so I won't go into that, but I did notice a lot of comments about changing Lilo's voice...  Now, I loved the movie from day one, I still watch it at least once a month, as well as the TV series (which is admittedly not as cool as the movies), and my house has been invaded with little pink eared alien plush toys and figurines.  I would say I'm a pretty serious fan, and you know what?  Until I went to look at the reviews today I didn't even realize the voice had changed, and usually that's something that would drive me nuts.  Seriously, I was so engrossed with the movie I didn't even notice, I think Dakota must have done a pretty good job mimiking her voice, and if the other actress is simply getting older, what else could they do?

The emotional heart wrenching plot alone is enough to warrant 5 stars.  Plus Chris Sanders as Stitch is equally adorable and brings a lot of emotion to it as well.  It would be unwise to watch without tissues and possibly aspirin as I'm nursing a ""cry headache.""

76527,4,078885383X,"Not only was Lilo & Stitch 2 released a week earlier than the US in the UK, but it was also released on the same day as the all-new Lilo & Stitch Special Edition (separately and as a double pack). This is a review for Lilo & Stitch: Stitch Has A Glitch, and the Lilo & Stitch 2-Disc Special Edition so US fans have an idea of what they have to look forward to:

First off- Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has A Glitch. Set after Lilo & Stitch, and before Stitch! The Movie and Lilo & Stitch The TV Series, it starts off with Stitch, Jumbaa and Pleakley living  happily yet rather crowded with Lilo, and Noni. Lilo is preparing for a big dance show with Stitch. Unfortunately Stitch has a glitch- his badness level behavior seems to randomly increase due to a fault when Jumbaa originally created him, and if the glitch isn't somehow fixed, Stitch will die!

  This is a much better effort than Stitch! The Movie. Granted the animation is still nowhere as good as Lilo & Stitch, but it is better. There is a repetition of hawaiian rollercoaster ride from the original and various new Elvis songs. The running time is short and sweet at just over an hour. As with most Disney video sequels, the story could still use some work, but despite this, it stays true to the characters. It's unfortunate that Daveigh Chase who has done the voice of Lilo up to now didn't do Lilo for this. Dakota Fanning did. Dakota actually sounds similar to Daveigh though I sensed something missing a little in the vocals. Still, it doesn't matter, as everything is very true to the original. In fact it really hurts when Stitch dies. Did I say Stitch dies? I guess you'll have to see for yourself, and don't let the fact that this is a midquel stop you from believing that. Either way, it's a close call, and the emotions are almost as heartfelt as Belle telling the Beast she loves him in Beauty & The Beast.

  The film is in Dolby Digital 5.1, and the bonus features include games and a music video.

  Overall I give this 4 stars, especially for the wonderful heartfelt ending.

And Now- Lilo & Stitch 2-Disc Special Edition. Firstly, all the bonus features from the first release are here, except for Young Voices of Hawaii, which is a big shame if you ask me. It was one of my favorite original special features. (See my March 2003 Review of Lilo & Stitch for further details) Also note that Can't Help Falling In Love With You is still not the full version. The film also has a new DTS surround sound track.

  New to Disc 1 is the UK music video of Suspicious Minds by Gareth Gates. There are also a sample of games which were previously on the Lilo & Stitch Island Of Adventures DVD. The big highlight though of the new special features for Disc 1 is the audio commentary by the producer and writer/director Dean Deblois and writer/director/voice of Stitch Chris Sanders. It wasn't as fun as I thought it would have been but you do learn a lot.

  Disc 2 is very in-depth and probably not for kids. This is a very real approach to what happened during the making from storyboard to screen. What we basically have is a documentary with additional clips and material (called footnotes here). Including footnotes the running time of Disc 2 is approximately 4 hours.

  And there are definitely some highlights: We get to see Chris Sanders do the voice of Stitch and the other voice cast at work. These are not quickie clips- an appropriate amount of time is spent seeing the cast in action. We also see animation classes. Another great highlight is the new deleted scenes not released in the first edition. My favorite was when it was time for Lilo's bedtime story, and it wasn't Noni that told the story to Lilo, it was the other way around. Very sweet and funny. Another deleted scene / alternate ending note is learning how the final action sequence was meant to involve a 747, but this had to change after September 11th. A new highlight is the newly recorded (in October 2003) of Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride. Yet another interesting part is the video diary of the team's time at the Cannes Film Festival, at an Italian Disney Store, in Germany, and at the premieres in Hollywood, Honolulu and Graceland.

  I even discovered how Canadian Dean Deblois had to get a visa to work in the US, how the trailers were made, that Disney Executive Thomas Schumacher felt Lilo & Stitch was Disney's best, and what was felt reflecting back on the film in December 2003 over a year after release.

  This is the Lilo & Stitch DVD you've been waiting for. For those with compatible DVD players you can order it from the UK now. The release has been delayed in the US throughout 2005, but it should be available in at best late 2005, or 2006.

76528,3,078885383X,"Just got back from seeing a sneak preview of the movie on the large screen in a theater in New York. L & S2 captures a lot of the flavor of the original film, much better than 'Stitch the Movie', which was pretty much a pilot for the current Disney TV series.

The plot is a little more simpler than the first film and more accessible for kids. I didn't think it contained enough of the cleverness that made the first film a favorite amoungst adults, but it does have it's own little fun touches, and Elvis' pressence is felt in the film, though not as strongly as the original movie.

I won't give away too much, but do have tissues ready towards the end of the film, it's very reminiscent of the climax of 'Beauty and the Beast' and may have the same impact of the infamous Bambi's mother scene.

Lilo & Stitch 2 will keep the kids entertained, and maybe a few adults will reach for the tissues as well.",1125100800,,905,4.25
76529,5,078885383X,"I got to see Lilo & Stitch 2: Stich Has a Glitch, on Sunday, July 17, during the last day of San Diego Comic Con International. The presentation was part of Comic Con's ""Kids' Day"" program, an acknowledgment that some of the biggest comics fans are indeed actually little bitty kids. The audience for the film (which was projected onto a screen from a DVD) consisted of my husband and myself, plus a room full of families with little kids. The room was filled to capacity, and people had started lining up at least half an hour before showtime.

I'm pleased to report that, for me at least, Glitch is a welcome return to the spirit of the original movie. The animation, even projected on a large screen, is fabulous. I was especially impressed by the use of shadows. But, it is also very fluid, and the character designs, though noticably different from the original film (somehow, everybody comes out looking ""rounder""), are true to Chris Saunders' unique drawing style.

This film also captures the emotional pitch of the original movie, while in some ways, deepening the characters. One main plot thread involves Lilo attempting to win the annual hula competition. For the first time, the movie explicitly mentions her mother. Lilo is initially depressed, because she doesn't have a mom to help her make her costume for the contest. Moses perks up her interest by showing Lilo an old scrapbook, with pictures of her mom, winning the hula contest! A very cute touch: mom is a ringer for little Lilo.

Lilo is also searching for inspiration for her hula dance, which must, of course, convey the spirit of aloha. The King himself provides a welcome hint.

Stitch's story is a little darker in tone. It begins with a bad dream about coming back to wreck havoc on the Island, including threatening his friend Lilo. Something is making Stitch lapse back into his old, naughty ways. Jumba, in making his diagnosis, reveals at last the story of hiscreation of Stitch, and how something that went wrong may spell doom for our little alien friend.

This sets up the main conflict with Lilo: is a victory in the hula competition, her attempt to get closer to the memory of her mother, more important than her continued friendship with Stitch, who suddenly seems intent on wrecking everything? I won't tell you how it comes out, but remember to bring plenty of Kleenex--near the end, many young'uns in the audience were openly bawling, as was a certain adult.

Oh, and try not to sip your coke while Lilo is thinking up ideas for her hula dance, as you'll probably snork it up your nose!!",1122508800,59,2579,4.7073170731707314
76530,5,078885383X,"Okay, so we're back from California and the Comicon.  Saw a lot of cool stuff, but one of my favorites was ""Lilo and Stitch 2"".  It was mobbed.  I almost didn't get in.  But it was worth it!  The movie is awesome.  It's as good, if not better than the first.  The characters are fun.  The animation is awesome.  And Dakota Fanning was great as Lilo.  I don't want to spoil the story for you, but it's called ""Stitch has a Glitch""... so Stitch is up to no good.  Funny. Touching.  A+

OLD POST:
Hey.  I'm so excited!  I'm going to see the new ""Lilo and Stitch 2"" movie at the Comicon in San Diego, California THIS SATURDAY!!!  I loved the first one and I can't wait to see this one.  I hope it's good... more like the first movies and less like the tv show.  The reviews look promising.  I'll let you all know what I think when I actually see it.",1121472000,12,845,4.07361963190184
76531,4,078885383X,"Daveigh may be older, but her voice sounds much better for Lilo than Dakota. I mean, doesn't Daveigh still do the voice for Lilo on the TV show?",1118188800,2,144,4.178571428571429
76532,3,078885383X,"I don't know when it is coming out over on Region 2 in the UK, so I am still eagerly awaiting this long awaited sequel. However, and it is a BIG however, it may absolutely suck without the aid of Daveigh Chase, UNLESS Dakota Fanning is REALLY CONVINCING! I don't know why Daveigh is not in this anyway, as she sounds perfectly fine in the series. And their voices are NOT THAT similar. I know Disney has a habit of making sequels where they replace one of the leading actors, and I just can't believe Daveigh won't be in this. She was flawless in everything else, the movies, series, even computer games! With some Disney sequels, the replacement voices are quite convincing, such as Mark Moseley replacing Eddie Murphy in Mulan 2, but in the case of Dan Castelleneta replacing Robin Williams in The Return Of Jafar, that didn't do it any favours, because it turned out to be terrible.

So therefore, Dakota will have to put in a really convincing performance as Lilo in this one, otherwise people will notice the difference too easily and there is the best chance it will suck. But as it is still a Lilo and Stitch movie which we have waited a very long time for, I still intend to check it out.",1115510400,,1196,4.4363636363636365
