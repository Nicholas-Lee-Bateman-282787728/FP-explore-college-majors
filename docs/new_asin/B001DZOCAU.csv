3544008,5,B001DZOCAU,"This is an excellent and humorous documentary of one of the great rivalries of college football.  Sponsored by HBO, I originally viewed it on HBO, which caused me to want to purchase it.  The rivalry dates to 1897 and while it covers the overall history of the rivalry, it also gives an appropriate focus to the intense ""10-year war"" between Woody Hayes and Bo Schembechler.  A fun video.",1264723200,,388,4.676470588235294
3544009,5,B001DZOCAU,"Michigan vs Ohio State, the original and best college rivalry!  Time to can Rodriguez and return Michigan to it's former glory!  But if you have to loose, could not think of a better team than Ohio State to win.  Look out Buckeye's the Wolverine will return!!!",1261267200,,260,4.608695652173913
3544010,5,B001DZOCAU,There's a lot of history here that even us grads didn't know.  The video is well done and provides a fair assessment to both sides.,1261094400,4,131,4.24
3544011,5,B001DZOCAU,"You get to see this DVD right before any Buckeye game and get pumped up and choked up!  If you are a true Buckeye fan, this is a must!",1257292800,,134,3.6206896551724137
3544012,5,B001DZOCAU,"HBO did their homework and respected both Universities, coaches and players!  It hugs your soul and brings a tear or two. I was apart of the ""Ten Year War"" of Bo and Woody and I was very impressed with all the facts presented. Life goes on, but no one will never have the effect that Bo and Woody had on the players or the fans.  GO BLUE!!!",1254700800,4,340,4.059701492537314

3544015,5,B001DZOCAU,"Love this video!  Saw this on HBO last year the night before the OSU - Michigan game.  I had never been to an OSU game before, but after I watched this video, I have now been to 5 games since, the last one being the OSU - Michigan game a few weeks ago!  I love the comradery of the Buckeye fans as there is nothing like it anywhere else.  And it was so much better being at the game than watching it on TV, even thought it was freezing cold at the game!  And it's all because of the rivalry between these 2 teams!  The Buckeye fans are the best fans in the USA!  GO BUCKS!",1229472000,3,572,3.8793103448275863
3544016,5,B001DZOCAU,"I have watched several ""Ohio State - Michigan Rivalry"" DVDs....and this is far and away the best one.

3544017,5,B001DZOCAU,"HBO out did themselves with this program! No matter if you are a die hard Michigan or Ohio State fan, you will appreciate the rich history and humor this program offers.

An excellent compilation of the rivalry between two of America's greatest college teams ever!",1219363200,21,346,4.421875

Note: This program was made in 2008 so it doesn't include any of the Brady Hoke or Urban Meyer era.",1431475200,,367,3.972972972972973

3544022,5,B001DZOCAU,"I'm from Michigan and remember this rivalry well.  I loved the humor and spent a great afternoon with retired teacher friends watching this together and eating pizza.  I followed it up by embroidering an Ohio crying towel for one of their alums, only to have them whup Michigan again.",1430956800,,284,4.775510204081633

3544027,4,B001DZOCAU,Anything with Ohio State is great for our family.  Bought for White Elephant game at Christmas and it exchanged hands as much as possible. I think we all would have loved to have had it.,1421280000,,186,4.314285714285714

3544031,4,B001DZOCAU,"Obviously The Ohio State Buckeyes have been dominant over the team up North but it's still always a fun rivalry. Hell, the team up North put up their best fight this season, yet failed while throwing an interception during a 2 point play opportunity. Yes, Michigan once again failed against the superior Buckeyeslol!!! Anyways, Michigan did take a few games from The Ohio State Buckeyes in the past proving that these games and teams will forever remain the biggest rivalry in sports until the end of time.

Michigan can go to hell for all I care, yet it's still fun watching The Ohio State Buckeyes of the past, present and future beat the team up North. I expect to see some great Ohio State Basketball far into this season too. Clearly the best defensive team out there. Damn, I'm excited about Buckeyes Basketball right now. Oh yeah, check out the Michigan rivalry in this video too.",1387152000,,887,4.685897435897436

3544034,5,B001DZOCAU,"Michigan vs. Ohio State the Rivalry was exactly what my husband was looking for.  It brought back a flood of memories for him. Having grown up in Columbus his father attended most of those games and spent hours talking about the games, players, coaches and the game with the massive snow storm.  Well worth the money just for the memories of time spent with a loving father who has since past.",1381449600,,393,4.52112676056338

3544036,2,B001DZOCAU,"This DVD was sent and the audio worked fine, but the picture began to cut out immediately. The screen would just cut to black while the audio was still working.

3544040,5,B001DZOCAU,"Ohio State-Michigan. Michigan-Ohio State. No matter how you arrange the names, it's good old fashion hate and contempt. HBO knocked this one out of the park with a tremendous documentary on what is arguably the best rivalry in sport. Apologies to Yankee and Red Sox fans. The intensity of these two proud state universities is well chronicled and presented in a first class production. A definite must for college football fans across the country. It goes without saying a must for all Buckeyes and Wolverines. Or, is that Wolverines and Buckeyes?",1342051200,5,547,5.021978021978022
3544041,4,B001DZOCAU,Rivalary from both points of view.  History of rivalry from beginning to time of production.  Must buy for college football enthusiasts.,1332892800,,136,5.428571428571429

3544043,5,B001DZOCAU,"After watching this DVD, there is little doubt that the OSU vs Michigan football game is the greatest rivalry in college football. If you are a fan of either school, it will make you laugh, make your cry and give you goosebumps!",1328572800,,228,4.4523809523809526
3544044,4,B001DZOCAU,"As a huge Michigan fan, this was a must buy for me. I have to say HBO really did a great job putting this together. There were a number of things I learned about the rivalry that I didn't know before. There were a few issues I had, though. First, the video was short. It barely reached the hour mark. I realize that it was a ""Made-For-TV"" documentary, but considering the Fab Five documentary was in depth and informative, I was expecting more. Second, it was made in 2008. I was expecting there to be more of Jim Tressel, Lloyd Carr (there wasn't anything with Carr in the video) and the (then) current Ohio St-Mich rivalry. Third, I think they could've went further with the rivalry. In my opinion, and lots of other people's minds, it's the biggest rivalry in all of sports. I thought it should've been treated like that.

Still, it was a very enjoyable watch and for what it is, it gets the point across.",1309305600,,908,4.404761904761905
3544045,5,B001DZOCAU,"Has the highest production values of any of the documentaries on The Game.  Very fair treatment of the history of the two teams and each fan base.  As a lifelong Wolverine fan, I found the interviews with Earle Bruce and Rex Kern especially good.  And if Earle Bruce's performance at a prayer breakfast the morning of the 2006 game doesn't create a lump in your throat or bring tears to your eyes, you're not a college football fan.  Can't watch it without hoping that our Wolverines start holding up their end of the bargain and restoring what is, I think, the greatest rivalry in all of American sports.",1296864000,,605,4.574074074074074
3544046,5,B001DZOCAU,"I had seen this ""documentary"" before on HBO, and had wanted to own it, being a loyal Ohio State fan.  A friend of mine is a Michigan fan, so I bought it for him.  Without the rivalry, there is no ""game"".  He loved it too.",1292544000,,221,3.8666666666666667
3544047,5,B001DZOCAU,This video captures the heart of the rivalry. Absolutely nails the love between the Buckeyes and Wolverines. That is we love to hate each other. Best video I have ever seen on this subject.,1284163200,2,189,4.588235294117647

8295602,2,B001DZOCAU,"40 minutes about OSU, 15 minutes about both teams collectively, 4 minutes about Michigan. If you're a Michigan fan, don't bother.",1511481600,,129,5.190476190476191
8295603,5,B001DZOCAU,I bought this for my girlfriend to watch before the season starts and before the big game. Although this video is outdated it is still just as good as it was the day HBO made it. Every year we watch this video before the big game and it never fails to hype me up for the game. I would recommend any U of M fan buy this. It goes back through the history of the rivalry and a lot of footage from games in years past. There are some great interviews with Bo and Woody. The only thing I would improve would be that I wish HBO would update this to include the start of the Harbaugh era. The video was filed right at the beginning of the Rich Rod nightmare. It's still worth it to watch and it will definitely get any U of M  hyped and yelling GO BLUE!,1500854400,,746,3.9403973509933774

8295607,5,B001DZOCAU,Ohio State is was voted greatest team over the history of college football by the AP.  ANd of course that makes the unquestionable greatest rivalry the OSU versus that team up North.  Great video,1470787200,,195,4.705882352941177
8295608,5,B001DZOCAU,"As UoM/OSU fan you'll love this, ""The Ten Year War."" It's Bo & Woody at their controversial best.",1461888000,,97,4.444444444444445
