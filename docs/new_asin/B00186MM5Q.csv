3411881,5,B00186MM5Q,"Wonderful film.
Watch it over and over and over.
Great moments and interviews.
Couldn't ask for a better 90 minutes.",1387238400,3,116,4.85
3411882,3,B00186MM5Q,"In 2004, my dream of a Red Sox World Championship came true- and a few months later, I was able to enjoy a recap of the events leading to that magic moment with the official World Series film of that year.  The emotion, the drama, the suspense- everything was there in a job very well done.  Three years later, the Red Sox celebrated another championship, and I was able to celebrate another brilliantly-done World Series DVD.

This year, I pre-ordered the WS DVD within days of the Red Sox winning their third title this century, received it on the day of it's release, and watched it immediately.  What a disappointment.

First, the 2004 and 2007 versions featured a great deal of coverage concerning the Sox' opponents in the World Series- the Cardinals and the Rockies, respectively.  This year, the National League Champions are almost ignored, as if they are bystanders in the final drama.  But that's a minor quibble compared to the real problem in this DVD- it all comes off as very flat and dull- every interview of the players, coach and execs is from the same angle and same distance from the camera lens, clearly in the same studio and the same background (jeesh, the color of the background couldn't even be changed between interviews?  Couldn't some of the interviews have been held outside at the park, or in the locker room, or ANYWHERE other than a studio in front of the same ugly screen?) It all comes off as very bland and repetitive, and the excitement doesn't come out at all.

The clips from the games are generally fine, but the best aren't always selected- I would rather relive what I saw on television than the view from some fan's camcorder in the stands.  Also, I'd rather hear what I heard during the games- the use of several different color guys calling the same shot sounds disjointed and awkward, reminding the viewer that they are watching a DVD compilation, making it more difficult to relive the actual moment (Jumping from regular speed to slow-motion for the same play has the same effect.)  I don't know why they always insist on doing this- when I watch one of these DVDs, I want to imagine as best I can that I am watching the game again.  I don't want to be reminded that I'm watching a film made up of various clips.

Also unlike the 2004 and 2007 films, the regular season is barely touched on in this film.  A lot of time (too much, in my opinion) is used reminding us of the Boston Marathon bombing. Yes, it was an important moment, and yes, it had a big impact on the team.  But including so much of it in this DVD clearly meant sacrificing coverage of the season.  One or two minutes on the bombing would have been appropriate- instead, it feels at times like this film is almost as much about the bombing as it is about the Red Sox winning the World Series again.

This is a good film- but unlike the 2004 and 2007 DVDs, it is not a GREAT film.  It's really quite dull at times and comes off as hurried and by-the-numbers.  I've watched the previous Sox WS DVDs many times each- I doubt I'll be popping this in the player anywhere near as often.  Come on, MLB- you can do much better than this.  I know, because you did in the past.

(Added after several viewings:  The Bonus Chapters include the end of each series, which is done very well, and EVERY World Series hit by David Ortiz.  By itself, the Bonus Chapters probably earn this DVD another star.)",1385769600,36,3403,4.478119935170178
3411883,5,B00186MM5Q,"Excellent, clear blu ray presentation of the 2013 Red Sox Season narrated by Ben Affleck. Starting with introductions of the new 2013 Red Sox players, right up unto the whole Boston Marathon bombing story, then quickly right thru the regular season and post season games. Superb Presentation!
This film will present David Ortiz's clear word-for-word verbatim (with subtitles) of what he said during his World series Game 4 rally-cry team meeting. So if you've ever wondered what Big Papi was saying to his troops...now you'll know!
If you're looking for more in depth highlights of the Regular Season and Post Season coverage, you will find it on the Bonus Disc, which is located inside the ""Boston Red Sox 2013 World Series Collector's Edition"" DVD or Blu ray. The Bonus Disc is not the same as this ""Official 2013 World Series Film"" presentation!

3411890,5,B00186MM5Q,"Superb MLB film narrated by Ben Affleck recalling the remarkable 2013 Red Sox season, culminating in another World Series championship. Okay, like myself, you may already have the complete World Series collector's edition with all the games in their entirety, but I recommend this as a very worthwhile addition because it encloses all the main highlights altogether on the one disc and is a great way to relive all the glory without journeying through eight discs.  It also contains a lot more personal observations especially from David Ross, Dustin Pedroia, Jon Lester, David Ortiz, Mike Napoli etc. and a nice mixture of game broadcast emotions from various radio and television commentators.  And Boston and Fenway Park have never looked better!
For Red Sox fans you can't go past this fine documentary for excellence and after a lousy 2014 season, this is nice reminder and appreciation of what an exciting and fulfilling year 2013 was for Boston's baseball fans and for the city, especially after the Boston Marathon bombings.  Now here's hoping for another bounce back season!",1412812800,3,1083,5.142045454545454

3411903,5,B00186MM5Q,"Living in Boston and being a lifelong Red Sox fan, I collect anything Sox related.  While this DVD might not have all of the bells and whistles in terms of extras, it touches on the ALCS and does a great job of bringing back the drama of the World Series.  Not as detailed as some others you can get, but if you were following the season and the playoffs when they happened, this brings back all the memories and emotions from that time.",1394582400,,437,4.253012048192771

3411911,5,B00186MM5Q,"Heaven only knows why people say we're from Beantown, as one rarely sees beans on any restaurant menu, and it's not like most people make baked beans at home. (We open a can of B&M, and have our hot dogs with that)  But after an 86 year lag, the Red Sox won their first 21st century World Series in 2004, and then added some whipped cream to that sweet, sweet moment by winning again in 2007 and 2013.

In 2012, they were the bottom ranked team in Major League Baseball. Not so in 2013!  This film gives you all the highlights of their battle to go from ""Worst to First."" Watch Papi and the boys play some amazing baseball and cheer them on the whole time. I have to admit, I turned the sound off while I watched, as 'Color"" commentary usually ticks me off, and this wasn't Jerry Remy and Don Orsillo or even Dennis Eckersley, who are like knowledgeable uncles, telling you the facts you didn't yet know. I'm sure the announcers did a decent job, I just like to watch the boys with people I know or with no one at all.

The video is outstanding, and will show you plays from angles you never saw before. Nowhere near as good as being there, but great to help you remember what you were doing in October, 2013. Boston Strong. Forever.",1391212800,,1233,4.278969957081545

3411924,5,B00186MM5Q,"Very nicely done video, unless you are a Yankee or Cardinal fan. Let's face it, this was an Impossible Dream that came true, not like '67. Lot of nice interviews, but I would have liked a little more game footage. Still, I was pleased with the overall length. For me, the part on the beards at the end was the best. It's hard to be objective with your favorite sports team, but I thought they did a very nice job with this. I was pleased they even had a little of the Duckboat parade in there (though they didn't show me in the crowd, just down from the Marathon finish line! Oh, well. But then, I would have been content to die and go to heaven, and you are reading this, you see I'm still here.) These are real guys, regular guys, and the film does a good job portraying that. The Yankees will probably win next year,big payroll and all ,but it's all good. You know? And I'll have this CD, and the Yankees will still have A Rod.",1389571200,,930,4.1722222222222225

Am I neutral?  Of course not.  But for Red Sox fans I have to say that this is a must have.  Not only does it cover all of the highlights of the 2013 playoff run, but it also puts the whole season in perspective.

More players lend themselves to the 2013 narration, and the worst to first aspect of this championship season is interesting, but I found myself bored many times during my viewing.

From my perspective, one of the best things about this DVD is that we DON'T have to listen to Joe Buck and Tim McCarver! Some of the personal comments during the action, and Big Papi's pep talk in the dugout (I've been a baseball fan for 70 years & I'm not aware that anything quite like that has ever happened) are there to be seen and heard. The best play is when Koji picked that stupid guy off of first base to end game 4! In truth I also can't remember a World Series with more mental and physical errors than these two teams committed.
