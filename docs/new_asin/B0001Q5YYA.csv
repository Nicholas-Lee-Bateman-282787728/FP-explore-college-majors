8016154,1,B0001Q5YYA,"I've become a Mickey Rourke fan after seeing his unforgettable performance in ""The Wrestler.""  I liked Mickey in the 1980's in movies like ""Year of the Dragon"" but kind of lost track of his career when he gave up acting for boxing.  So I've been catching up with some of Mickey's filmography over the past several months.  I know he made some straight-to-video stinkers during his ""lost years"" to pay his rent and unfortunately ""Exit in Red"" is one of them.

There is the kernel of a plot somewhere in this movie: a compulsive psychiatrist lured into intrigue by a mysterious woman, a psycho husband, a murder.  But this production seems to have spent more money on Mickey Rourke's hair and wardrobe than an actual script.  The result is that Mickey looks great but the story stinks.  Scene after scene goes by and you aren't really sure what this movie is about.  Add to this excrutiatingly bad dialogue, terrible editing and ridiculous overacting by Anthony Michael Hall, plus weird and laughable plot twists and you have a cinematic car wreck that seems to be trying for ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" awfulness.

It's worth watching (barely) if you like Mickey Rourke.  As mentioned, he looks great but doesn't really have a lot to do.  Also, his great love Carre Otis has a supporting role yet only adds to the dullness.

Watching a film like this, you have to wonder at the total incompetence of the producers, writers and director who gathered an interesting cast but made such a terrible movie.  Did anyone stop to consider that they needed a story?  ""Exit in Red"" is most notable as an example of how low Mickey Rourke had to sink to stay alive during the 1990's.  It makes his comeback in as great a movie as ""The Wrestler"" all the more dramatic.",1248480000,3,1751,4.621359223300971
8016155,3,B0001Q5YYA,"Poor old Mickey Rourke. This really is NOT a good film for him - well, to be more specific, this really is NOT a good film, period. But if you are even the slightest bit interested in or curious about Anthony Michael Hall, then put it on your must have list without delay.
Those who remember him as the awkward skinny schoolboy in Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, or as the mop-haired, sex-starved computer geek in Weird Science, may well be forgiven for not recognising him in this film - 6'2 and powerfully built, with  a terrifying glint in his eyes that makes his portrayal of a murderous lunatic all the more compelling.
Apart from that, the film is singularly unremarkable, with a desperately clichd plot (I use the term advisedly) and a script that relies heavily on the F-word to flesh it out to any real proportions.",1084060800,,832,4.583892617449664
