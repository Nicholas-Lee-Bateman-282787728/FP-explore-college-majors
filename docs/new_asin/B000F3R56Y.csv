8116874,5,B000F3R56Y,"Rodney Dangerfield hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" during its fifth season, on March 8, 1980.  At that time, the cast included Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, Laraine Newman, Gilda Radner, Paul Shaffer, Harry Shearer, and Don Novello as Father Guido Sarducci.  The episode begins with people bugging Rodney while he's in his dressing room.  Rodney gets to utter the famous line; ""Live, from New York, it's Saturday Night!""  That's followed by Rodney's opening monologue, when he tells some of his classic jokes.  ""I know I'm ugly.  I stuck my head out the window and got arrested for mooning.  The first time I had sex I was scared.  I was alone!""  That's followed by ""The House Of Sperm"" sketch.  Bill Murray runs the sperm bank.  Paul Shaffer (cast member, not band member) and Gilda Radner come in and want a baby with a great sense of humor.  They ask for a sample from Rodney Dangerfield.  Soon, more and more couples come in, wanting a Rodney sample.  Rodney can't keep up with the demand.  In the end, it turns out that Rodney was only dreaming.

After the J. Geils Band and Weekend Update (hosted by Jane Curtin and Bill Murray), there's a sketch filmed in black-and white.  It's ""Manhasset,"" which is located on the north shore of Long Island.  It's a parody of Woody Allen's movie ""Manhattan.""  Rodney's character is having a romantic relationship with a ten-year-old girl scout, played by Laraine Newman.  As Rodney says, ""She's everything I look for in a ten-year-old.  When I try to get her into bed, she starts crying.  She wants to stay up for another half hour.""  Politically incorrect humor like that sketch would probably not be broadcast now.  In the ""Order In The Court"" sketch, Brian Doyle-Murray plays a substitute judge.  Everyone in the courtroom start acting like little kids in class with a substitute teacher.  Rodney Dangerfield plays a defendant named Richard Hertz.  He prefers to be called Dick, and you can guess the joke that follows.  Lastly, Rodney plays a shirt inspector who keeps adjusting his tie and turning his head, the way he usually did during his stand-up routines.  All in all, this is one of the best episodes of ""Saturday Night Live,"" as well as another highlight in Rodney Dangerfield's long and distinguished career.",1405555200,,2293,4.867875647668394
