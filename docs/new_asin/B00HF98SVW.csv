6161371,2,B00HF98SVW,"After buying the first DVD for this TV show (MvA Cloning Around) that had first 8 episodes of the Season 1 in the chronological order, I expected this DVD to continue where the first DVD stopped.

I expected this DVD to be like this: starting with episodes 9-13 of the Season 1, and then continue with first 5 episodes of the Season 2 (or whatever amount of episodes can fit on the DVD).

While, remaining episodes of Season 1 are present in their chronological order, they just threw in random episodes from the Season 2, even in a mixed order. It seems that there will be no more DVDs for this TV show. I do not understand why a great idea of releasing TV shows with episodes in their chronological order -- a season after a season -- always have to be ruined with the release of a following DVD.

Maybe that's why there is not any list of episodes on the back of the DVD case -- to fool people and sell them a strange idea of the randomized selection of episodes.

The list of episodes:

1. 98 Pound Cockroach/When Nature Shrieks
2. Vornicarn
3. It Got Out of Hand/The Sound of Fear
4. The Sorry Syndrome/Speak Not the Q Word
5. Screaming Your Calls/The Time-Out That Wouldn't End
6. It Came from Channel 5/It Ruled With an Iron Fist
7. Driven to Madness/The Beast from 20,000 Gallons
8. The Sneezing Horror/Prisoner of the Dark Dimension
9. Number Seven!/The Friend Who Wasn't There

In summary, I do not like it at all.",1394755200,17,1424,4.395437262357414

8632300,5,B00HF98SVW,"Lots of fun. The production company has done a good job of capturing the loopy feel of the movie, and the characterizations are spot-on, despite a completely different cast of voice performers. The cartoon loses some of the darker, conflicted subtleties of the film, but more than makes up for it with humor and energy. This is the second volume, a nice follow-on to the first one, 'Monsters vs Aliens: Cloning Around.'",1411689600,2,419,4.833333333333333
