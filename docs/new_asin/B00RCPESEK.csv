6925888,5,B00RCPESEK,"Having grown up in the Midwest, I love watching giant combines travel in staggered rows across vast fields of golden wheat, as they harvest the ripened crop.  This excellent documentary, THE GREAT AMERICAN WHEAT HARVEST, includes some beautiful footage of  combines in action, but it's primarily about the people who take those huge combines on the road each summer to bring in the latest crop.

These ""custom harvesters"" can consist of large operations that buy new combines and hire and train many employees each season, or of small businesses that buy used combines and employ family members as food preparers, truck drivers, and harvesters.  Regardless of the outfit's size, once the harvest begins the race is on to get all the wheat cut before rain, hail, wind, or fire can destroy it.  The harvest starts in fields in Texas, moves north through fields in Kansas and Nebraska, and ends in fields in Montana--and those heavy combines, with accompanying supply trailers and living quarters, must be transported along state roads from field to field.

It's heartbreaking to see the effects of the ongoing Midwestern drought.  Some fields are mere stubble, with barely enough standing wheat stalks to cut.  But other fields are a sight to see, with standing wheat stalks bearing plump, fully-formed grains.  The documentary shows that farmers and custom harvesters alike are interesting, upbeat people who love what they do.  And that they always shrug off adversity by looking forward to next year's harvest.

6925889,5,B00RCPESEK,"This is definitely an inspirational and informative film that allows us to learn about exactly what wheat farmers go through on the daily in order to provide basic food to sustain a nation. This film reveals a great behind the scenes look at the struggles wheat farmers face, while highlighting and providing recognition to all the hard work that these farmers do for consumers like us. Provides great insight into a farmers world, and it is definitely worth your time to check out this film! The videography is amazing as well!",1437955200,2,528,4.813186813186813
6925890,5,B00RCPESEK,"Wow, I thought that the life of a farmer was just working in their field and harvesting their crops. I never realized the amount of work that actually goes into it! Watching this movie gave me a whole new appreciation for the farmers of America and the intense labor that they do. If you are a consumer of wheat products, this movie is a must see!",1435708800,,347,4.2727272727272725
6925891,5,B00RCPESEK,"Very good at show how the wheat gets harvested.  As livestock farmers ourselves,  we were curious as to how other farmers work.",1434240000,,127,4.7272727272727275
8694851,3,B00RCPESEK,"I remember watching a documentary on TV about custom wheat harvesting some years back, and thought this was probably the same film. I bought the DVD but don't believe it's the same film, so am sort of disappointed as it isn't as good as the film I remembered.

In any case, I thought this documentary was OK but not exceptional. The running time is relatively short, about an hour. I liked the interviews of the family members/ladies who work to prepare food and assist in other ways. I noticed one reviewer of this DVD complained about it being ""disgustingly religiony"" (sic), which is too bad that he has no understanding of rural life, as farming and faith in God are and always have been deeply connected. ""Praise God from whom all blessings flow"" including a bountiful harvest! I was glad the filmmaker included some comments about faith in God, and prayer in the documentary.

My disappointment with this particular film is that it's like sitting down to a meal and the gravy, vegetables, pie and coffee are all there, but the meat and potatoes are not served. There's a lot of storyline about hiring good help from other countries, preparing equipment for the long months of work ahead, the difficulties of weather conditions affecting the harvest, and traveling over the road. But footage of the actual harvesting work which should be the ""meat"" of the documentary is limited, or spoiled by talking and edits. Granted, not everyone might like to sit back and enjoy drinking in the sights, sounds and feel of sitting in a combine cab and watching the header cutting the wheat for an extended period of time, but if the filmmaker had added maybe even a 5 minute sequence of just that sort in the middle of the film (without music or voice-overs), it would have given the film more of a core.

Instead of having the ""deleted scenes"" in a bonus section, this is a short film so why didn't they just include them in the film itself? The ""after the harvest"" sit-around chat doesn't add anything and is lifeless, and I don't understand why it is presented in black and white, either.

The film is OK but seems to somehow feel incomplete. I liked parts of it, but doubt I'd recommend it to others.",1490054400,,2197,4.640102827763497

8694853,1,B00RCPESEK,"I did NOT like this video at all !  It's very disgustingly religiony,  they're trying to ram their religion down your throats.  Video is mostly JD and NH combines  ( BORING ! ) ,  IH combines are almost non existent in this movie.

This video is mostly about owners of harvest run operations crying about having to work 5 months of the year,  and whining about having to travel and go on harvest run. Who wants to watch a movie about a bunch of crying and whining ?

The ""AFTER HARVEST"" interview was shot in black and white  ( WTF ? ? ? ? )  ,  and was just dull, awkward and boring.

The ""CREW INTERVIEW"",  the crew members did not have mics on them,  so you couldn't hear what they were saying.  All you could hear,  was mumbling between the crew members.

This video is not only ,  NOT worth the money,  it's NOT worth your time to watch it !  If you want to watch good harvest videos,  get ---- ""THE 2 THOUSAND MILE HARVEST"" ,  and  ""CUSTOM CUTTERS"",  they are much better movies !",1464739200,,986,4.149732620320855
