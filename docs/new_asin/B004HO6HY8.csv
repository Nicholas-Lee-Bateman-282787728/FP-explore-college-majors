4375819,5,B004HO6HY8,"I was not looking forward to watching this movie, My wife saw it for 8.99 new from a seller and BAM two days later it was in my mailbox!!

I almost threw it away and hope she would forget about ordering......however right when I walked in the door, ""did my movie come!?!?!""

As you could guess an hour later I was watching it and to mu surprise this was not a bad little movie. not a great Disney classic but I have seen much worse as of late, very cute movie and would be great for any family or for any couple that like a little goofy in there romance.

I would actually watch this movie again and recommend for others to as well.",1308096000,27,632,4.080645161290323
4375820,2,B004HO6HY8,"You know how SOME animated films are enjoyable for the little kids in the audience but still keeps some elements in the film to also entertain the adults too?  ""Gnomeo & Juliet"" absolutely, unequivocally, definitely, comprehensively, assuredly, exhaustively, concretely is NOT one of those.  Even if you know the Shakespeare story of the Montagues versus the Capulets and how Romeo and Juliet's forbidden love ended tragically, the different ending on this latest animated re-interpretation won't entertain you as an adult.  Jason Statham is one of the familiar voices, whereas James McAvoy (Gnomeo) and Emily Blunt (Juliet) are not so familiar.  The film has many Shakespeare references beyond the immediate theme, and other voices familiar include Michael Caine, Maggie Smith, and Patrick Stewart.  Elton John being the executive producer, it then is no surprise the soundtrack has several Elton John songs.  Hulk Hogan's voice is given to a lawn mower, Ozzie Osbourne is the voice for a fawn (young forest ruminant), and a handful of other Hollywood notables lend their voices as well - yet it doesn't redeem this film beyond the juvenile marketing theme throughout the picture.  On the other hand, on opening weekend (mid Feb 2011) the box office take was over $25M, and by June 2011 this movie had earned $99.7M at the box office.  Now it has been released on DVD.  If you have kids, some of the really younger under 4 children may be frightened by the lawnmower race and then later in the show there is an even more intimidating ""Terrafirminator"" that at first is thought to have killed two of the gnomes in a rip roaring path of wanton destruction.  The rest of the film is like caramel topping on ice cream, with honey added.  Touchstone, Rocket, and Miramax are the companies behind this animated piece, but Walt Disney wouldn't have changed a thing.  Look for two elements most people miss - the laptop computer is not an Apple, but has a banana logo on it; and, on the bus that goes by the bus stop in front of Gnomeo and the flamingo character, the placard on the side of the bus says ""Stratford-Upon-Avon"" which was the home of William Shakespeare (the famous playwright whose story this film is based on).  I can only recommend this film if you have at least one child in the home under 10 years old.  As an adult, you aren't given anything to enjoy.  The hidden humor and suggestive tones just don't exist in this film.  Hopefully the movie coming out July 29, 2011 titled, ""The Smurfs"" will offer more to the adults who try to sit and watch animated movies with their kids and grandkids.",1308009600,,2603,4.776785714285714
4375821,1,B004HO6HY8,Did not follow the Romeo and Juliet story. Was a waste of my time! Don't waste your time with this movie!!!,1307923200,4,107,4.142857142857143
4375822,5,B004HO6HY8,"The cover art suggested cheap, low budget, plain graphics but surprisingly the animation was nuanced and complex and even gave the surface texture and imagined movement characteristics of typical garden figurines an accurate portrayal.

The humor was appropriate for all ages and actually had a creative and intelligent substrate to much of it.

Voice selection was well chosen and fortunately Disney and associate organizations stayed out of writing, directing, etc. resulting in a clever somewhat unique story although the clan warfare plot is a bit time worn.

Had a Shrek and Kung Fu Panda feel to the characters and their behaviors which, although a positive, is starting to get old.",1307404800,,688,5.236363636363636

4375824,5,B004HO6HY8,"Gnomeo and Juliet are the star crossed offspring of warring gnomes from competing English gardens. I thought I'd hate it and came away absolutely enthralled.

Rather than the sickly sweet purely kids fare I expected there were all sorts of wonderful Shakespearean and pop references for the adults. I spent as much time spotting little gems from Hamlet (the home addresses are 2b and not 2b) as I did trying to explain the meaning of ""Timmy's fallen down the well? Why do I keep thinking of wells?"". I laughed, the kids didn't. There's even a Borat gnome and a Fawn who is some kind of mafia enforcer. What's not to like?

Juliet isn't a useless heroine, in fact Gnomeo falls for her during their initial meeting while she is dressed as a Ninja and kicking his behind. The secondary characters are richly drawn and full of humor and the voice talent is some of the cream of British acting talent.

The Elton John soundtrack meshed beautifully with the story and had me singing along and the production values, pacing and script were absolutely perfect. It's not often that a movie actually exceeds expectations but this one did.",1307232000,4,1128,4.715736040609137

4375826,5,B004HO6HY8,"I have to admit that when I saw that the director also directed Shrek 2, I was a little put off and didn't want to take the risk of watching this movie.  I also let some of the reviews on here prevent me from immediately watching it.  That said, I think that this movie was awesome!  I only rented this, but it will definitely become a title that I will purchase.",1307145600,,363,4.084507042253521

4375828,4,B004HO6HY8,"It's certainly a novel concept, despite the fact that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has been retold in almost every form, from West Side Story to The Flintstones. In the case of Gnomeo and Juliet, the story becomes one of lawn gnomes, the ""red"" and ""blue"" groups who live next door to each other in a British suburb.

Lawn gnomes and gardening are popular in the U.S. to be sure, but their is a significant passion and pride in gardens that is decidedly English. That doesn't mean Americans won't ""get it;"" and as a matter of fact, the film was a surprise box office hit domestically. Just pointing out that the tone, comedy and the cast is predominately English, which suits Anglophiles like me just fine.

It's a very funny film, not so much an animated film in the Disney Cinderella sense than in the Disney Jungle Book sense -- a collection of funny set pieces arranged around a simple storyline with some tender moments here and there. The film was released under the Touchstone banner rather than Disney, perhaps because it doesn't follow the Disney mold in general and contains a few naughty bits, like the one gnome who runs around in a Borat-like swimsuit.

Overall, it's a charming, witty romp, beautifully designed and executed (though I kind of liked the second alternate ending better than the one that was used).

The voice cast is excellent, but the stars are really the Elton John/Bernie Taupin hits that complement the story, including two superb new songs (John himself appears in a bonus feature). The songs don't seem clumsily shoehorned into the story as an excuse to use them; they fit remarkably well.

Sir Elton was reportedly miffed that the film was not given what he perceived as sufficient support, yet it did quite well anyway. I can't help wondering how much more of a sensation it would have been had it been released shortly after The Lion King, which would have capitalized on the new renown for Elton John and when his music catalog was at the perfect age for nostalgia and the fascination each generation has with whatever was popular two decades before it).",1306886400,5,2094,4.741758241758242

4376074,4,B004HO6HY8,"In the beautiful British town of Stratford-Upon-Avon there's a street where the owners of two neighbouring houses have no idea of the rich lives being led in their backyards.
In these backyards there are two groups of garden gnomes - one garden is ruled by the blue hatted variety, the other is ruled by the red hatted variety. An age old feud - of which the reason has long since been forgotten - is keeping them apart, but unexpected events might just be enough to get them back together again.
Loosely based on the Shakespearean tragedy Romeo And Juliet this animation film keeps the middle line between tragicomedy and romance. Like many animation films being made these last years it combines fun things for kids with fun things for adults - without hurting either group (the innuendo that is fun for adults is not seen by kids whose innocence protects them from it, the deviation from the original tales to make it fun for kids is not so warped that it makes it unrecognisable for them parents).
The animation is great - the gnomes and the gardens are just lovely to watch. The setting with gnomes is flawless - the sounds, the implications of being a garden gnome - it works out really well.
If there would be one bit of negativity for this film it is that its trailer is a bit too biased towards an audience that wants to see romance instead of a bit of light comedy.",1474243200,,1375,4.504

I enjoyed the music of Elton John, but as far as I am concerned, that's the main selling point.

When you purchase a blue-ray or DVD and it says digital copy in this day you expect an online copy not a CD that you can copy to your computer.  This is was is meant in this case.  The digital copy was not to Vudo or Disney online but a copy to your hard drive.  Otherwise the purchase was perfect.,1468540800,,358,3.863013698630137

But when you throw yard gnomes into the mix, my curiosity was peaked enough to give it a try.  And I am so glad that I did!  The story has enough of the in it that it is fun to follow as an adult, but it is hilarious and thankfully not as sad as the story in which it is modeled after.  I would highly recommend it if you want to watch a fun movie about the blue gnomes vs. the red gnomes and how love can conquer even the worst family squabbles.

4376256,5,B004HO6HY8,"Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet and has become a
timeless classic, and certainly one of the author's most
popular plays.  It has been re-imagined many times for
stage and screen, most notably in 1961 for West Side
Story.  Now, once again, the tragic love story has been
re-imagined by the folks at Touchstone animation in
this newest film, Gnomeo and Juliet.

Gnomeo and Juliet was actually the brainchild of
Elton John, who served as Executive Producer on
this film.  It is my understanding he spent the last
decade developing this children's re-telling with the
idea of using Gnomes for the subject matter of this film.
Personally, I think it was a brilliant idea as these
highly-underrated garden sculptures have gone mostly
unnoticed with, uhm, the exception of the more infamous
Traveling Gnome that has been roaming around with
Travelocity for all these years.  Sir Elton John and the
animators certainly had a wide playing field before them
and they take every advantage of  throwing in as many
ceramic and garden puns as possible, though most of the
humor that flies over kids heads will bring a smile to adults.

The Montagues and Caputlets are represented as feuding
neighbors living in a London suburb, each with a gardened
backyard filled with a variety of adorable gnomes who have
taken on the lead characters of the Shakespearean play.
These feuding Gnomes are represented as blue and red,
segregated into separate gardens divided by a huge wall.

The blue-painted Gnomeo (voiced by James McAvoy) falls
in love with the red-painted Juliet (Emily Blunt) and both
must find a way to continue their relationship despite
the escalating feud between the two families.  Juliet's cousin
Tybalt (Jason Staham) is faithfully represented as the
main antagonist in the story, a hot-headed gnome who is
bent on destroying Gnomeo and the rest of the blue gnomes.

Gnomeo and Juliet takes the source material, follows
it mostly through, but takes a few added liberties to give
the tragedy a happy ending -- all with the blessings of
Shakespeare himself (Patrick Stewart).  After all, this is
a children's film where tragedy should be turned to happiness.

I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this film
going into it, as I believe it only had modest success at
the Box-Office and was released to home video almost
immediately.  And though nothing about this film leads me
to believe it will be a memorable classic, I did manage to
have a fun time watching it.  You'll instantly appreciate the
cast of voices here from the likes of Maggie Smith, Michael
Caine,  Ozzy Osbourne, Dolly Parton and Hulk Hogan.

The clincher in really appreciating this film was its near
faultless viewing experience. This is a first-rate Blu-ray
and perhaps one of the best looking animated transfers
in recent memory.  Firstly, the transfer is exceptionally sharp
and well detailed.  This allows for the film's brilliant array
of colors within the gnomes garden world to vibrantly saturate
the screen.  In fact, this is perhaps the most chroma-enriched
animation that I have seen.

Yet, despite the immaculate transfer, the 3D is only...well...
adequate.  I haven't been able to find out if the film was rendered
specifically for 3D or upconverted in post, but the end result is
just average.  There is definitely noticeable separation and at
times you get that nice cardboard cut-out look (for those like
myself who prefer that kind of thing).  I felt as if the animators
could have made better use of placing their characters behind
objects that would lend to a greater perception of depth.  Another
failing I found was that most all the 3D effects stay within the
confines of the screen with the exception of a few poke-outs that
include sticks, weed killer gun and a flamingo's beak.  There
are some overhead shots above rooftops that give a spectacular
sense of depth but used only sporatically.  There are some lost
opportunities with falling flower petals and dandelion seeds that
would have looked spectacular floating before the viewer's eyes,
but yet, never reach out beyond the display.  That's not to say
that Gnomeo and Juliet is a total disappointment in 3D.  I felt it's
use of the format definitely enhanced the viewing experience --
it's just not anything anyone's going to display as demo material.
It really disappoints me that when dealing with animation, you have
the ability to do some really cool 3D rendering and in the end, you
are not providing the audience with any ""Wow"" factor.

Fortunately many of the scenes that take place under the veil
of darkness do not suffer any ghosting issues.  In fact, ghosting
is practically nonexistent here.

Gnomeo and Juliet features the music of Elton John whose
notable pieces of music are peppered throughout the film either
as instrumental or original recordings.  There is also at least
one new song featured by Elton and his long-time collaborator
Bernie Taupin, though I have to admit it's pretty forgettable.  Still,
for Elton fans, the film plays like a ""greatest hits"" tribute with songs
such as  Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting,  Dont Go Breaking
My  Heart, Rocket Man and Your Song,

Featured on this disc is a 7.1 DTS-HD soundtrack that was
downconverted to 5.1 on my system.  There is excellent stereo
imaging to be found here and I was quite taken back by the
surround's ability to bring out the tiniest nuances in the effect
sounds.  I mean, you can hear the crack of every branch as
the little gnomes race across the yard.  Unfortunately, the one
complaint I have is that the audio lacks ""punch.""  I mean, here
is a film filled with instrumental and pop score and it sort of
comes across as bland.  For my personal tastes, I would
have wanted a little more LFE activity to give a little more kick
to the music. Otherwise, this is an active soundtrack certain
to embrace the viewer.

Gnomeo and Juliet arrives in a 3-disc Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray,
DVD/Digital Copy.  The added content appears on the standard
Blu-ray disc and includes 2 alternate endings, deleted and
alternate scenes and a featurette.

Though it will never be considered an animated classic,
Gnomeo and Juliet succeeds as being a cleverly enjoyable
family film.  The 3D is just average, and it's disheartening
that the animators didn't make better use of the props for
the format.  Still, when considering the price difference between
the standard Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray, the latter is positively
worth purchasing.  Bravo to Disney for doing such a wonderful
job on this transfer as it doesn't get much more beautiful than this.",1453075200,,6565,4.91470054446461

In keeping with the original tragedy, there were a few tear-jerker scenes.  But lots of really funny stuff.

There are a few adult humor lines in the movie that would not be appropriate if children knew what they meant,  but they don't so for now, I'm okay with it.  I think I recall ""shut up"" but my children know that's a bad word so they overlook it. There is a ""pansy"" comment, but they haven't repeated it since it's something like ""do I like like a begonia,  no,  more like a pansy"" so it's an indirect insult. I could be confusing this with another movie, but I thought this one also said ""let's go kick some grass"" but that may be a different movie. My children are under 6 years old and while some parents think the movie isn't appropriate,  mine have overlooked slang and little comments. The only thing that has slightly scared them is a big scary mean lawn mower.  So, I'm giving it 4 stars.",1408924800,,968,4.291208791208791

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet and has become a timeless classic, and certainly one of the author's most popular plays. It has been re-imagined many times for stage and screen, most notably in 1961 for West Side Story. Now, once again, the tragic love story has been re-imagined by the folks at Touchstone animation Entertainment One in this newest 3D film, Gnomeo & Juliet.

Gnomeo & Juliet was actually the brainchild of Sir Elton John, who served as Executive Producer on this film. It is my understanding he spent the last decade developing this children's re-telling with the idea of using Gnomes for the subject matter of this film. Personally, I think it was a brilliant idea as these highly-underrated garden sculptures have gone mostly unnoticed with, the exception of the more infamous Travelling Gnome that has been roaming around with Travelocity for all these years. Sir Elton John and the animators certainly had a wide playing field before them and they take every advantage of throwing in as many ceramic and garden puns as possible, though most of the humour that flies over childrens heads will bring a smile to adults.

The Montagues and the Caputlets are represented as feuding neighbours living in a London suburb, each with a gardened backyard filled with a variety of adorable gnomes who have taken on the lead characters of the Shakespearean play. These feuding Gnomes are represented as blue and red, segregated into separate gardens divided by a huge wall.

The blue painted Gnomeo [James McAvoy] falls in love with the red painted Juliet [Emily Blunt] and both must find a way to continue their relationship despite the escalating feud between the two families. Juliet's cousin Tybalt [Jason Staham] is faithfully represented as the main antagonist in the story, a hot-headed gnome who is bent on destroying Gnomeo and the rest of the blue gnomes. Gnomeo & Juliet take the source material, follows it mostly through, but takes a few added liberties to give the tragedy a happy ending and all with the blessings of William Shakespeare himself [Patrick Stewart]. After all, this is a children's film where tragedy should be turned to happiness.

Mostly, however, Gnomeo is interested in mimicking the William Shakespeare plot without taking anything too seriously. So if Gnomeo is the pride of the blues, it's the loutish Tybalt, the tough-guy actor Jason Statham who does the honours for the reds. As in the play, Gnomeo and Juliet meet without knowing they are from rival families. Once they discover the truth, it is too late, they are already in love, news greeted with morbid delight by Juliet's nurse, a frog with a Scottish accent named Nanette [Ashley Jensen] who all but squeals ""it's a doomed love, that's the best kind! How romantically tragic!""

More helpful is Featherstone the plastic flamingo with a heavy Cuban accent [Jim Cummings]. Completely uninterested in these colour wars ""I'm pink, who cares,"" Featherstone, like his Gnomeo & Juliet co-stars, is a force for love, innocence and old-fashioned fun. Playful, inventive and endearing, this 84-minute epic is smart enough not to overstay its welcome as it steers clear of the fatuous and the formulaic. As Shakespeare himself might have put it, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished, even if it took a pack of gnomes to make it happen. You'll instantly appreciate the cast of voices here from the likes of Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Michael Caine, Ozzy Osbourne, Dolly Parton and Hulk Hogan and all the voices seem to fit their characters are really superb and it is  a massive big hit with me and a joy to watch, especially in the stunning 3D effects.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The clincher in really appreciating this film was its near faultless viewing experience. This is a first-rate 3D Blu-ray and perhaps one of the best looking animated transfers in recent memory. Firstly, the transfer is exceptionally sharp and well detailed. This allows for the film's brilliant array of colours within the gnomes garden world to vibrantly saturate he screen. In fact, this is perhaps the most chroma-enriched animation that I have seen. The 3D is an immaculate transfer. I haven't been able to find out if the film was rendered specifically for 3D or up converted in post, but the end result is just average. There is definitely noticeable separation and at times you get that nice cardboard cut-out look (for those like me who prefer that kind of thing). I felt as if the animators could have made better use of placing their characters behind objects that would lend to a greater perception of depth. Another failing I found was that most all the 3D effects stay within the confines of the screen with the exception of a few poke-outs that include sticks, weed killer gun and a flamingo's beak. There are some overhead shots above rooftops that give a spectacular sense of depth but used only sporadically. There are some lost opportunities with falling flower petals and dandelion seeds that would have looked spectacular floating before the viewer's eyes, but yet, never reach out beyond the display. That's not to say that Gnomeo & Juliet is a total disappointment in 3D. I felt its use of the format definitely enhanced the viewing experience and it's just not anything anyone's going to display as demo material. It really disappoints me that when dealing with animation, you have the ability to do some really cool 3D rendering and in the end, you are not providing the audience with any ""Wow"" factor. Fortunately many of the scenes that take place under the veil of darkness do not suffer any ghosting issues. In fact, ghosting is practically non-existent here. Much like those earlier releases, the 3D here doesnt have a lot of in your face gimmicky elements but instead seems designed to immerse the viewers into the world being presented.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Gnomeo & Juliet features the music of Sir Elton John whose notable pieces of music are peppered throughout the film either as instrumental or original recordings. There is also at least one new song featured by Sir Elton John and his long-time collaborator Bernie Taupin, though I have to admit it is pretty average. Still, for all you Elton John fans out there, the film plays like a ""greatest hits"" tribute with songs such as Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting, Dont Go Breaking My Heart, Rocket Man and Your Song. Featured on this disc is a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack and is brilliant to appreciate the visual ambience, I was quite taken back by the surround's ability to bring out the tiniest nuances in the effect sounds and The surround sound makes you feel as though you are in the middle of the backyard amongst the gnomes.  During the lawnmower races you can hear the dust swirl around you and the advertisement for the mega lawn mower, the Terrafirminator, practically shook the room. I did enjoy the fact that you could hear the clink of the stone when the gnomes held hands. On top of all that, the excellent 2.0 Dolby Digital stereo imaging to be found also and I mean, you can hear the crack of every branch as the little gnomes race across the yard. I feel like I could watch this animation film over and over and hear something new each time.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Alternative Endings with Filmmaker Introductions: Elton Builds a Garden [2011] [10:00] [1080p] Takes a brief look at Sir Elton John and his studios involvement with the movie how his music was used. Alternate Endings with Filmmaker Introductions with Two different endings Alls Well That Ends Well and Dance Routine both are in storyboard form. Nothing here changes the story, just the routine at the end.

Special Feature: Frog Talk with Ashley Jensen [2011] [1080p] [2:00] This is a behind the scenes look at Ashley Jensen and her voice acting performance as Nanette, the talking frog.

Special Feature: The Fawn of Darkness [2011] [1080p] [2:00] This is a quick look at the casting of Ozzy Osbourne as the lawn deer character. Overall, this felt very short and I think it would have been interesting to get a deeper look at Ozzy Osbourne at work voicing the deer!

Special Feature: Crocodile Rock Music Video [2011] [1080p] [2:00] This is the music video for the Sir Elton John Song Crocodile Rock featuring Nelly Furtado.

Theatrical Trailers: Gnomeo & Juliet Theatrical Trailer in 3D [1080p]; Astro Boy Trailer [1080p] and Furry Vengeance Trailer [1080p]

Finally, with the extras, the audio is solid and the picture is very strong, meaning the 3D Blu-ray is the right choice for anyone looking to purchase Gnomeo & Juliet particularly as it includes a 2D version; and childrens re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet told with garden gnomes and an impressive voice cast that may not be the next Toy Story, but provides a decent amount of entertainment, a few jokes even the adults can enjoy, and a painless introduction to the world of William Shakespeare. Overall, this home release of Gnomeo & Juliet will be most enjoyed by Sir Elton Johns biggest fans, who will love hearing his new tunes mixed in with classics throughout the film. The CGI animation is terrific and the gnomes really do look ceramic and there's enough fun here to keep the children and their parents entertained for the duration. It is definitely a gnome-run and I give it 10 out of 10 for effort and it has now gone pride of place in my ever increasing 3D Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

4376942,3,B004HO6HY8,"The Romeo-Juliet story told for 10-year-olds.  Excellent animation.. a lot of movement and the garden gnomes were surprisingly accurate and funny to watch.  A lot of color.. bright, sunny days, moonlight.. and a good story.  Just good, not great.

As we watched it, I related to our 10-year-old daughter the real Romeo-Juliet story as told by William Shakespeare.  When I told her the ending, she yells 'WHAT?!'.  Yes, THAT was tragic.. off the charts.  The writers tried to capture some of the tragedy.. and they did.. the story was generally okay.. two ""feuding families"" of red vs. blue gnomes.. accurate.. but didn't really impact us.  We could have chosen another movie.. (""West Side Story"" for a much closer version to the original).

This movie ended on a very ""up"" note.. happy, everybody safe.. and life in Gnome-ville goes on.. enemies are reconciled, etc., etc...

The most interesting vignette takes place in the middle of the movie as the story involves the Elton John song ""Love Builds a Garden"".. without words.. from young love to a failed, crumbled marriage.  It almost moved me to tears as I sat there looking at my wife and daughter.  At one point, my wife gasped.. ""Wow"".  That part was tragic and accurate.

Elton John's music runs throughout the movie (he was one of the producers.. duh!).. and it is used very effectively.  There was a lot of humor, and a lot of ""gnome jokes"".. naturally.  I'd say we enjoyed it, but probably have no desire to own it.. or revisit the movie again.  Fun, but not memorable.. unless it challenges young minds to explore the real Romeo-Juliet Shakespearian tragedy.  That WILL stick in their minds.. and offer significant life lessons about families and relationships.",1402012800,2,1722,4.899653979238754

It also shows how two people from different sides of the fence can bring a tribe together.  I also liked how the writer incorporate real people into the story for the existence of the male flamingo who saves Gnomeo from shattering into a thousand pieces at one point.

The one I got is from Canada (even though it wasn't mentioned on the amazon listing....the image they used for the package doesn't indicate it either...) It wasn't a big deal as everything was still in English, the quality was great, and we got a great deal on it. Even though I didn't mind, I figured I'd put it out there for people who are concerned about that sort of thing. Picture and sound quality are like any other Blu-Ray (we also bring the DVD in the car, and think it looks and sounds great too) mastered from a digital source. Gorgeous.",1387152000,3,714,4.296296296296297

4377088,5,B004HO6HY8,"Absolutely one of my all-time favorite movies!  I know that it is aimed at kids, but there are enough ""hidden"" references to Shakespeare sprinkled throughout to make it wonderful.  The computer, the name of the flamingo, the moving company..... Love it....",1382227200,,256,5.219512195121951

4377090,5,B004HO6HY8,This is a very well done animation.  There is a lot of emotion and several very sweet moments in this movie.  The characters are entertaining and able to keep a child's attention.  There is a lot of mischief but even the most intense scenes are not realistic or scary.

4377124,5,B004HO6HY8,"I ordered this DVD for my 2 yr old grandson, he loves, but so does the rest of the family.  It is very entertaining and has the music of Elton John. I highly recommend it for family entertainment.",1380499200,,196,4.157894736842105
4377125,5,B004HO6HY8,I really did like this movie! I'm a sucker for romance and this was even better than I thought it would be. Ending was kind of cheesy though.,1380499200,,141,4.071428571428571

4377128,5,B004HO6HY8,"Seeing the ads for this when it first came out, I thought this would be very funny.  My wife wanted to go see it in the theater, ended up it was being shown in 3-D during that phase, didn't really get a lot of out it being in 3-D.  My first impressions of the movie was it was okay.  I was expecting more, but after it came out on DVD and we bought it for my daughter and watched it a few times, it grew on me and I actually really enjoy the movie the more I've watched it and really actually payed attention to it.
Never been a fan of Elton John's music, not that there is anything wrong with his songs, its just not my type of music, it does mix in well with the movie and adds to its elements in the scenes that the songs are connected to.  There are some parts that are kind of ""tongue and cheek"" jokes that the parents will ""get"" and keep you entertained but its also just a nice twist on the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" love story told in a funny and entertaining way for kids.  Highly recommend this for a family movie night, maybe kids under 4 or 5 might not get into it as much or understand it, but I don't recall anything that is really scary or inappropriate for kids to see.",1378512000,3,1186,4.008474576271187
4377129,5,B004HO6HY8,"This classic tale is retold with humor, and gnomes!  For us the first laugh came about 23 minutes in, and the last happened during the closing credits.  Good fun for the whole family, with humor for all ages!",1378425600,,208,4.447368421052632

I was thrilled to be able to come home and instantly pull this movie up from Amazon. This is a very affordable way to view new or older movies and the price of a couple of dollars to rent for three days fits right in to my fixed income bracket. I plan to rent more movies in the future. There is no standing in line or paying $30 as opposed to $2.00. Cute story line and music.",1373760000,,503,4.13265306122449

4377235,5,B004HO6HY8,My daughter and I just love this movie! Elton John provides a spectacular soundtrack with well established hit songs and Juliet is a wonderfully strong female character. The dynamic between her and Gnomio is fun and light hearted. A star studded vocal cast is a bonus but this movie could stand alone on the strength of the story and script. I'm sure you will enjoy it!,1367625600,,369,4.606060606060606

4377240,3,B004HO6HY8,"The movie is a cute movie and love story that is probably appropriate for most children. The animation was fun, the characters were intriguing. Not bad for a kids movie.

However, the gnomes call each other names. ie: Idiot. Some parents may not want their young ones hearing these words yet. Also, Gnomeo has a conversation with the statue of William Shakespeare in which Shakespeare explains how in the original story Romeo and Juliet end up killing themselves. Again...really not a G rating and may not be appropriate for many kids.",1366502400,,535,4.8791208791208796

4377432,5,B004HO6HY8,"It is really hard to find truly suitable movies for children these days. If I had my way, I would show my son every classic movie that I love, but his attention span just is not there yet. Next to a classic movie, I guess a family cartoon is the next best thing. One great cartoon that I recommend - and I have seen six times now is the movie Gnomeo And Juliet. It is the first movie my son pretty much sat through.

Gnomeo & Juliet is a 2011 British computer-animated family comedy film based on William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The film is directed by Kelly Asbury, and the two main characters are voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt. Gnomeo & Juliet is directed by Kelly Asbury. The original screenplay, inspired by William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, was written by John R. Smith and Rob Sprackling. Asbury, Mark Burton, Kevin Cecil, Emily Cook, Kathy Greenberg, Andy Riley, and Steve Hamilton Shaw worked on the final screenplay. Prior to the casting of James McAvoy and Emily Blunt, the roles of Gnomeo and Juliet were to be voiced by Ewan McGregor and Kate Winslet, respectively. In addition, this film reunites veteran British actors Maggie Smith and Michael Caine, from the 1978 Neil Simon comedy California Suite, in the roles of Lady Blueberry and Lord Redbrick, respectively.

The film was the original idea of Sprackling and Smith, who sold the spec script to Disney through Rocket Pictures. Initially, the film was going to be produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, but was shut down by its new chief, John Lasseter, after the Pixar acquisition. Miramax Films picked up the project and guided its production until the division closed down. Australian director Adam Elliot was approached and asked to direct the film, but he rejected the offer due the film's incompatibility with his style, as well as his lack of experience with CGI. The film later was picked up and produced by Starz Animation in Toronto. It was released under the Touchstone Pictures banner on February 11, 2011, becoming Touchstone's first animated film since 1993's The Nightmare Before Christmas and also Touchstone's first film to receive a G rating from the MPAA.

I want to admit something here as well. I have even watched the movie when my son was not around, but it's a cute movie. Admitting I have a problem I guess is half of the battle!",1348185600,,2354,4.750611246943765

Lots of cute moments throughout the movie that keeps both children and adults entertained. The color scheme red verse blue makes it easy for the kids to understand and follow the movie. They don't miss the fact that this is a love story but it is kept rated-G of course. Both main characters have strong personalities and that helps to keep all of my kids engaged (boys and girls).,1346112000,,518,4.350515463917525
4377466,4,B004HO6HY8,"OK, lets get the negative stuff out of the way. As its detractors are
so eager to point out, this isn't as good as Toy Story, or the vast
majority of Pixar's outlet. It's not as good as Lion King, It's not as
good as Shrek. And it does weirdly over-rely on the music of Elton John
(who executive produced).

Fine. But that doesn't mean it can't be a cute, enjoyable, witty spin
on Romeo and Juliet, with two backyards full of garden gnomes (and
other garden features like frog fountains) at war with each other, and
star-crossed lovers from each side falling in love in spite of it all.

And who can dislike the voice cast;? James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Michael
Caine, Maggie Smith - some of Britain's very best bring character and
comedy to their parts, as do, in their own weird way Ozzy Osborne and
Hulk Hogan in cameo roles (For that matter who could resist any film
that brought such a surreal bunch of voices together?).

Yes, this isn't an all-time classic. But I think we've gotten so
spoiled by being in a golden age of cartoon features that it's too easy
to dismiss a good solid, fun effort like this.",1345766400,,1109,4.4

4377471,4,B004HO6HY8,"There's a pretty strong chance that had Disney not come on board with distribution and promotion for Gnomeo and Juliet, the film wouldn't have made that big of a splash here in the United States.  But back in early 2011, it was pretty difficult to avoid the slurry of commercials, trailers and posters (complete with catchy little taglines like ""A Little Adventure Goes a Lawn Way"").  And let's be honest: The computer generated feature film industry can be very, very lucrative- just ask Pixar.  It makes sense that Elton John's production company Rocket Pictures would decide to roll the dice and try to grab a piece of the pie for their 8th and most recent project.

So the immediate question is does the world need a sort of pseudo retelling of the William Shakespeare romance as told from the perspective of garden gnomes of all things?  Surprisingly, yes.  At least much in the same way as back in 1995 we stopped what we were collectively doing to tag along with a little wooden cowboy, plastic spaceman and a slinky-dog.  Sometimes decent storytelling comes from the most unlikely of places!

So is it to suggest Pixar and DreamWorks need to fear the rise of Rocket Pictures? Hardly but in all fairness Gnomeo and Juliet is a pretty enjoyable romp with just enough layers to its humor to keep the adults snickering while the little ones clamor to the bright visuals and slapstick.  Then again considering the film was rumored to have required 9 credited writers an 11-year span to develop, it kind of goes without saying it should be at partially clever in its delivery.  And clever it is: Imagine a world of garden gnomes as active and energetic as any human populace with the burden of freezing into their standard poses whenever anyone so much as glances in their direction.

Now add in a romantically obsessed frog/sprinkler, a Cuban accented pink flamingo, a slew of adorable little bunnies and a loyal if misguided reindeer and the formula for some miniaturized excitement begins to come together.  Now cap things off with feuding neighbors Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet, some lawnmower racing and dozens of Shakespearian references sprinkled about (my own fave being the address of the duplex: 2B and Not 2B).  Of course a soundtrack chalked full of Elton John classic tunes never hurts either!

Wisely the plot doesn't go the tired and clichd route of simply retelling the Shakespeare play so much as it draws a series of parallels to the source material then calls itself out by having a statue of the legendary playwright make an appearance explaining that he too once told a similar tale with a slightly, um, more tragic ending.

Pacing is spot on across the 84-minute runtime as would be expected from a veteran such as, say, the director of Shrek 2 and though there is some silliness scattered about, the film never loses touch with that elusive sharpness separating an enjoyable film for all ages that just so happens to be animated from a cartoon only kids can enjoy.  A classic example of the subtle wit comes from Michael Caine as Juliet's overprotective father with the habit of using the wrong words when he speaks.

In all I was pleasantly surprised with Gnomio and Juliet- if perhaps not for what it does right then for what it avoids doing.  And that's relying too heavily on slapstick or over-the-top visuals to replace clever writing.  Add countless pop-culture and even antiquated references for sharp-eyed viewers to search out and an infectious soundtrack and you have a pretty enjoyable way to spend an evening.  Here's hoping Rocket Pictures will revisit the CG feature film genre again in the future.  They may not yet be in a position to overthrow the industry heavyweights but that isn't to say they aren't keeping them honest.",1341878400,,3767,4.809302325581395

4377507,5,B004HO6HY8,"i went in thinking ""this will be too silly to be entertaining especialy with a G rating"".but i was WRONG!IT was entirely charming and fun.from the frog who acted out a tragic love story for juliette and on.
  there were quite a few important people involved in this.ozzy osbourne did the rein deers voice and on an internet ad,hulk hogans voice advertised a really mean looking lawn mower.
  there were a few questionable things  said and done.there were a few sexual innuendos but nothing children should pick up on.another time a guy says ""insane in the brain"" which is a reference to a cypress hill song about marijuana.another time they steal a mans underwear.personaly,i wouldve gone PG.
  THERE were a lot of funny things too which heavily out weighed the bad.when juliette was getting ready for her date with gnomeo,they used duct tape to shave her legs.
  there was a mexican flamingo in an english story.it was out of place but ended up being important to the story.i wonder how many mexican movies put in white guys just to make them feel better.none i bet.
  there were also a few ""forrest gump"" references like ""run gnomeo run"" and ""i may not be a smart bird but i know what love is"".
  for those of you who are extra perceptive and imaginative,you may see a dragon on juliettes dads hat.remember,i did use the word ""imaginative"".
  being as how,the guy from ""elf"" played as a demi-human elf which is like a gnome in many ways,it seems appropriate that he was the screen saver on the internet.i never thought i'd see the internet on a ""romeo and juliette"" movie but the times they are a changing.[that was my cameo from medal of freedom winner bob dylan""]
  even with ozzy osbourne,elton john,cypress hill,hulk hogan,romeo,juliette,forrest gump,the and the elf,they still found time to squeeze in a hilarious bit with old shakespere himself.it was classic!
  juliettes mom throws in ""unleash the dogs of war"" which is actualy a misquote.its actualy ""wreak havoc and let slip the dogs of war"".there is a battle,but i assure you,its done as very,very silly and funny.some of the stuff in the ""toy story"" trilogy was way worse.
  this movie is fun for adults too.so don't plan on being bored.plan on being entertained.there are a LOT of jokes that are slipped in there cleverly.they are for someone who knows the story or is simply older than the targeted age group.
  and finaly,i was wondering the whole time how they were going to make a G RATED ending out of this.it WAS a tragedy ending in a double suicide.im pretty sure nearly everyone if not the whole cast was killed in shakesperes version.but,they killed bambis mom didn't they?dont worry! its a nice and innocent ending for everyone.i say buy it.its absolutely charming!",1338422400,,2740,4.795309168443497

It looked really cute and colorful and vibrant and energetic and just a total distraction, which is what I was hoping for.  Instead, I got something remarkably bland in moments, boring almost, that didn't add enough variance to create something special.  This is sad, because this really could have become something truly epic; instead it settled for mediocre.  That isn't to say that the film doesn't have some merit.  The voice work is nicely played by the entire cast, and that Elton John/Lady Gaga original song (Hello, Hello) is fun and plays at the right moment to create a dash of charisma, but in the end this film fails to live up to my expectations (which were, arguably, too high).

4377597,4,B004HO6HY8,"OK, lets get the negative stuff out of the way. As its detractors are
so eager to point out, this isn't as good as Toy Story, or the vast
majority of Pixar's outlet. It's not as good as Lion King, It's not as
good as Shrek. And it does weirdly over-rely on the music of Elton John
(who executive produced).

Fine. But that doesn't mean it can't be a cute, enjoyable, witty spin
on Romeo and Juliet, with two backyards full of garden gnomes (and
other garden features like frog fountains) at war with each other, and
star-crossed lovers from each side falling in love in spite of it all.

And who can dislike the voice cast;? James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Michael
Caine, Maggie Smith - some of Britain's very best bring character and
comedy to their parts, as do, in their own weird way Ozzy Osborne and
Hulk Hogan in cameo roles (For that matter who could resist any film
that brought such a surreal bunch of voices together?).

Yes, this isn't an all-time classic. But I think we've gotten so
spoiled by being in a golden age of cartoon features that it's too easy
to dismiss a good solid, fun effort like this.",1322006400,2,1109,4.4

I liked that the characters were cute little lawn gnomes. And there was a fued between not only the gnomes because they were red and blue there were fueds between the neighbors that own them. I also like that Gnomio and Juliet actually have time to fall in love and getting to know each other instead of falling head over heals at first sight. Its a great movie for kids adults and teens to watch. I admit I had a feeling I was going to like it. But I didn't think I would love it as much as I do now. I'm not going to give it away too much of what happens. I also loved that Elton John music was played in the movie. I realize people may critize this movie for not being like Romeo and Juliet. But everyone must understand that you don't want children to see violence and two people commit suicide because of a fued that keeps them a part.

I add Gnomeo and Juliet to the list.  I loved it.  Very colorful and uplifting (opposed to several darker films), followed main plot of Romeo and Juliet..Being a kids film, I did not expect it to go deep into Shakespeare anyways.

Instead of the female being portrayed as fragile and delicate mainly, it gave a more realistic portrait of Juliet as a strong and independent, yet loving and loveable,woman.  (I recently saw Tangled and was not impressed)

As the cover portrays, Gnomeo and Juliet are a team, overcoming every obstacle that the world throws at them, and doing it together.  Touching ""love story,"" suitable for all ages.  Enjoy.",1314662400,,807,4.875

Cute and odd garden gnomes come to life when people aren't looking and they have a (familiar) feud wherein two gnomes on opposite sides fall in love.  Of course, it couldn't end like the tragic original tale...but it could have been done better.  Way better.

The animation was good, but the plot was ho-hum.  And it wasn't all because they had to give it a happy ending.  I usually enjoy animated kid's movies, but this one fell flat.  There weren't enough funny parts, the action was obvious, and I couldn't care about the characters.  Juliet was marginally cool when she was taking charge of her life, but Gnomeo was pretty unlikeable all round.  The best character was the sad pink flamingo and even that became annoying by the end.

The movie could have been given more of an edge and yet not gone over the edge.  What about the human owners of the two gardens--why was there no focus on how that reflected on the battle between the gnomes of the two gardens.  Perhaps, they could have been former sweethearts or fell in love as Gnomeo & Juliet did?  A tragic death scene that reflects the original could have been done...with a twist.  The writers seems rather underinspired, or perhaps they think that kids don't deserve more?

This movie doesn't hold a candle to great kid's movies like The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, Toy Story, and Shrek.  Maybe worth watching once, but not really worth owning.",1313971200,,1459,4.614785992217898

Some other reviews here are critical about the change in story line (which is not authentically Shakespeare) or that there is too much dialogue, which makes it boring.  I don't agree with either of those assertions. Yes, there are changes to the Romeo and Juliet story, as there should be for a short kids film. Yes, there is a lot of dialogue, but how come kids aren't exposed to ""wordy"" movies? This dialogue-heavy movie might just help to expand their vocabulary a little!

4377724,4,B004HO6HY8,I ordered this movie thinking it was a retitled version of Nightmare in the Daytime.  That was the name I input and the movie I purchased came up.  Unfortunately it was not the movie in a retitled version.  I did recieve the movie listed in a reasonable time and in good condition.  The problem apparently lay with whomever placed in under the listing Nightmare in the Daytime.,1312156800,4,377,4.582089552238806
4377725,5,B004HO6HY8,I thought the DVD was just great and filling with Elton John music.  My daughter loved this DVD! So did mommy and daddy:))),1312156800,,123,4.3478260869565215
4377726,5,B004HO6HY8,This movie was fun for the whole family.  The kids (ranging from 5 - 19) all enjoyed it as well as my husband and I.  It had tons of funny scenes that the kids understood and enjoyed and some appropriate adult humor that we enjoyed.  Super cute movie.,1312070400,,251,4.1875
4377727,1,B004HO6HY8,"In this movie, whenever the owners leave their home, the gnomes in the front yard would come to life and have fun.  The idea sounds good, but this movie did not work for me.

It is not that the movie did not follow the original story.  I can not tell you exactly what the problem was, but after maybe about half an hour, I stopped watching and so did my five year old daughter.  Maybe the problem was with animation, maybe it was the script, maybe it was the story.  Some of the children movies are appealing to adults as well as the children.  As an adult, this movie for me was just boring and lame, really lame.

Sooo hit me, kick me, or spit on me if you want.  I am giving this movie one star.  :)",1311379200,3,702,4.028985507246377
4377728,4,B004HO6HY8,"I ordered this on a whim for the kids for a family night not long after it first came out. I love how Elton John's music is incorporated throughout, even in the background. I also really appreciated the small tributes to Shakespeare, like the Rosencratz and Gilderstein moving van. Even my thirteen-year-old enjoyed it, which really surprised us. Anyway, it's a fun little diddy, not to be taken too seriously but to be just enjoyed. The cast is star-studded, from James McAvoy to Michael Caine. I would recommend this to any family for a fun family night in.",1311206400,,559,4.714285714285714
4377729,5,B004HO6HY8,The movie is cute for kids and still entertaining for parents.  I have to endure movies at least 25 times because my sons will watch the same thing over and over.  I find myself asking the boys if we can watch this movie instead of others because I enjoy it so much.  The Elton John music throughout the movie is very enjoyable.  I can tolerate it much better than other sing songy tunes that get stuck in your head and torture you at work the next day.  There are some really funny moments and it has a much happier ending than the original Romeo and Juliet.  Parents and kids will enjoy this movie.,1311120000,,600,4.265486725663717

4377812,5,B004HO6HY8,"The premise of Gnomeo & Juliet is as simple as it is charming - a re-telling of the classic Romeo & Juliet tale in an all-ages story starring a cast of, yes, garden gnomes.  Well, not entirely garden gnomes - there's a bullfrog, some pink plastic lawn flamingos, a deer, a turbo-powered ride-on lawnmower, and a few other such characters, but the gnomes are the mainstay.  The blue-hatted gnomes of one backyard and their red-hatted counterparts in the yard next door have been feuding for ages, so it's inevitable thast when the adventure-seeking title characters encounter each other and fall for one another, trouble is sure to follow.

  I've maintained for a long time that an awfully lot of the best comedies out there can be found in the family section of the DVD store, and this one is in that batch.  It provides way more laughs than a lot of the big titles in the comedy section, and on top of that packs in ample cute appeal and a special magic that simply charms the heart.  There's just something about those rotund little gnomes scurrying about in their prized blue-or-red hats that's irresistable.  The voice acting is very well done.  With the main characters, Gnomeo & Juliet bucks the growing trend in western animation to bring in big-name stars who import their trademark personas into their animated roles, and instead lets the talented voice cast, for the most part, fit into their characters instead of the other way around.  A few exceptions to this exist in the cameo appearances of unlikely stars for supporting characters, but that's done so well you don't mind at all.  Great job on the animation itself too, with lots of care put into the facial expressions and often comedic body language of the little gnomes and their cohorts.  Overall, Gnomeo & Juliet successfully blends the wit of modern animated fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;with the innocence and sweetness of Disney classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dumbo-Two-Disc-70th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Pack-in-DVD-Packaging/dp/B004YHRZLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dumbo (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack in DVD Packaging)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bambi-Two-Disc-Diamond-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-in-Blu-ray-Packaging/dp/B004AKCMES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bambi (Two-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>.

4377867,2,B004HO6HY8,"When I saw this movie I thought, ""How could anybody think this is good?"" This movie has almost no plot and the movie was released like nobody has edited this. If Pixar were to do a remake of this, I bet everything would be different and the movie would at least earn a B. From some of what I saw in the movie, it almost feels like the movie should have been rated PG. Reason is because in a G rated movie, most of the time the characters don't get destroyed or killed. In conclusion, I say, ""Nice start, but let another movie company redo this movie.",1309046400,2,550,4.149532710280374

4377870,1,B004HO6HY8,"This is the standard Romeo and Juliete story minus the deaths, the tragedy and basically all the interest. My husband said it was a complete waste of time, but I feel it would've been okay to watch on cable or if you had a chance to watch it for free. Any type of charge to watch this would be money lost.  The music has all been heard before and even though I love Sir Elton John, I wasn't impressed with the soundtrack. Visually it's appealing with lots of bright colors and the voice acting is pretty good.  The storyline falls flat though and I feel like I just threw money down the toilet buying the blu ray with all the additional disks and digital files.

Did the film make me suffer in agony? No.
 Did I enjoy it? No.

My one word description of it is ""Bleh."" I did, however, appreciate that it was clean. I hate it when kids movie sneak smutty references into them. We have no kids, so I can't say whether or not kids would enjoy it, but I felt like it was one of those movies that are a little too dumbed down for kids.

Got my favorite beverage ready. I even opened a bottle of wine about half way through... but the bottle of wine was to help me endure the remaining half of the movie.

It was hokey. The graphics were great but I felt that all the jokes were forced and the story line made me wish . I was so dissapointed. I was excited when I found out that it was from one of the creators of Shrek... I had such high expectations. But it was just not my cup of tea... and it severly ruined my glass of wine.

I realize that we each have our own preferences.  I am not saying this is a absolute NO for everyone. It was just not for me... and I really like movies like this.  The movie did not deliever what I was expecting.
