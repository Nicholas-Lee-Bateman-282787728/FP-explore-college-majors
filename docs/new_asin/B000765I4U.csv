8044856,1,B000765I4U,"Yes. The movies are fantastic, especially Forbidden Planet, a true classic and well ahead of its time in visual effects, but I have a serious problem with the asking price of $185.00 for this trio of old movies that can be purchased individually right here at Amazon for about $10 each or less. I beg to question. Is there ANYONE on the ENTIRE PLANET that is STUPID enough to pay this asking price? If there is, I have a bridge I'd like to sell them.",1372464000,2,450,4.305882352941176
8044857,4,B000765I4U,"I've been monitoring prices on these great classic 50's sci-fi films for some time, and for the life of me I don't know why people selling this trio used think they can get away with selling this three-pack for one hundred dollars. Especially when all three films are still in print, one is available as a double feature with an additional film, and another has been reissued in a two disc edition. If you buy all three new on this site you pay less than half of what these ""vendors"" are asking you to pay used for the same three films bundled together.

""Forbidden Planet"" is now in a two-disc edition that was reissued in 2006 with lots of extras, ""Them!"" is available in a double-sided disc with ""The Beast from 20000 Fathoms"", and ""The Thing From Another World"" is available in the same edition as the one in this old three pack. If you don't like double-sided discs you can still get ""Them!"" alone on one one-sided disc. Take the money you save and go out and buy ""Blade Runner"" to go along with these.",1188604800,5,1007,4.413978494623656
8044858,5,B000765I4U,I've wanted these on DVD for sometime.  Each story has great effects for the time - with Forbidden Planet being the best - even better then a lot of model based effects from movies made years later.,1173312000,3,198,4.351351351351352
8044859,5,B000765I4U,"Classic Sci Fi. All three stories are original, and fun. The special effects are GREAT!!!!! See Robie the Robot for the first time, and possibly the first mini-skirt.",1170720000,2,166,4.964285714285714
