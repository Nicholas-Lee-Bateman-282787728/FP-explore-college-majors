It following poor dance students in Cuba through their schooling and focuses on one female who eventually comes to the US.

The problem I had while watching it is the narration is really minimal. You may go 3-4 minutes before you hear the English-speaking narrator (the films director) and her narration has no feeling to it. Between this all the people you see on screen are speaking Spanish. Yes, there are English subtitles but they are selective. Only when the director feels that you need to know what is being said are the subtitles (in smaller typeface than most other FRF films) shown. There were periods when the teachers were telling the students something but no subtitles appeared. (Im assuming I did not have a defective copy and that the minimal use of subtitles was the directors decision.

The film is only 96 minutes but seemed much longer with these period of no translated dialogue or narration.  The only bonus is a photo gallery (do we really need these as bonuses?) and text biographies. The press release (the DVD was sent to me by FRF for an objective review) listed interviews as DVD Extras. Obviously they were not added as they are neither included on the DVD nor listed on the package.

So, honestly, this film disappointed me. I wanted to learn more. And I would have liked a more engaging narrator.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8741038,5,B017Y9DLE6,"Aside from politics, there is one thing the world agrees on when it comes to Cuba: They produce fantastic ballet dancers, both male and female! This is a first class professional documentary showing what life is like for high school ballet students(""secundaria"" means ""high school"" in Spanish). It shows both the training sessions in school, performance segments on stage, and home life. Whereas most Cuban ballet documentaries avoid getting into politics, this one seems to wade just a tiny bit into political waters. It shows the hardships of Cuban life. It even comes down hard on the confiscation of prize money by the Cuban government. And then there is the defection of Mayara Pineiro to the USA. It deals with this in considerable detail.(Currently, Mayara is a soloist for the Pennsylvania Ballet and is featured on the cover of the April/May 2016 Pointe magazine.) The narration is in English and there are additional English subtitles. You can also select Spanish subtitles. There isn't much in the way of bonus material other than biographies, a photo gallery, and previews. This is an important addition to ballet documentary discography.",1458864000,,1150,5.1550802139037435
