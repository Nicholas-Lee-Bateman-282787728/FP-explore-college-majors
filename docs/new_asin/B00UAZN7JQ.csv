The music is awesome of course, but the product description is misleading. Beware, people looking for official audio. I can't tell you how disappointed I am.",1489795200,,315,4.962264150943396

Overview
Hand. Cannot. Erase. is quite different from Raven, both conceptually and musically. First off this is definitely a concept album whereas Raven was a collection of ""stories."" Second, the jazz elements from Raven are less prevalent, in my opinion, with more straight forward elements of rock appearing. This has the effect/vibe of making the music feel more accessible. There is more of an electronic feel and the keyboards (both electric and acoustic) seem to play a greater role. There are some ambient passages as well so the overall listening experience from song to song definitely feels more cohesive. Those comparisons aside, this is just another great collection of music from probably one, if not the, most relevant and talented, hard-working artists in the scene.

Deluxe Earbook Edition (2CD/DVD/Blu-ray)
While there is no doubt that the music of this release stands by itself as a work of art, the earbook and the discs contained therein represent a completely immersive tactile, aural and visual experience of unprecedented proportions. Steve Wilson once again collaborates with Lasse Hoile (photography), Hajo Mueller (illustrations) and Carl Glover (design/artefacts). While Raven's Limited Edition book set a precedent of its own, it should not be surprising that Wilson and friends have pushed the envelope further in terms of the quality and depth of not only the music but the art and the visual and tactile presentation as well. This limited edition is better in every aspect.

The Story
Karolina Grzybowska ""stars"" (aka models) as ""H"" - a woman in her 30's who is estranged from her family and friends. An introvert, she prefers a life of solitude with as little interaction with the busy and somewhat insincere world around her. The story begins with H's childhood/family background and progresses quickly to her adolescence where her parents adopt a 16 year old ""sister"" named ""J."" H and J quickly become connected and share some of their experiences, music, friendship, etc. In only 6 months the parents separate and so do the two girls. This is only minimally traumatic - yet significant - for H who prefers her own company anyway. H meets up with a boyfriend in college but subsequently distances herself from him when she feels things are getting too ""serious."" Further distancing herself from the world around her, H begins to have ""visitors"" who question her about her attachments and relationships. H develops a fascination with news stories about people who ""disappear,"" and the interaction with the visitors and her own questions about her ability to be invisible to those around her raise questions about her significance and purpose in life. The rest of the story is more speculative and can best be left to the listener's/reader's interpretation. Suffice it to say, there is much more depth provided in the artbook - too much more information would spoil the story. There are still things I've not yet figured out yet as well. I will say that this story was inspired by a real story as Wilson points out on the DVD, but the story presented here varies quite a bit from the true-life version.

The Artbook
This 108 page hard-bound book is a work of art itself. Not only does it contain pictures and art chronicling the story of H, but it contains ""artifacts"" - such as a birth certificate, childhood journal, newspaper clippings, postcard - which help elucidate the story and make you feel as if you are actually touching the items owned by this young woman. The story is presented in a journal fashion from the standpoint of the woman H. Each entry enhances the meaning and character behind the songs. Additionally, the lyrics to each song are cleverly contained within journal entries, diary entries and other media. It's really quite brilliant. The written words certainly help capture not only the meaning behind the songs but also help enhance their emotional/human connection. This is art at its highest calling - the connection between visual, tactile and aural - perfectly executed.

Disc 1/The Music
The opening song ""First Regret"" is essentially an ambient piano prelude to ""3 Years Older"" which is an upbeat, rhythmic piece featuring a driving bass guitar line reminiscent of Geddy Lee, and Minnemann throws in a few Peart-like drum fills as well. The beginning and ending definitely has a Rush vibe but the song middle is a mixture of styles - the dynamic contrast between soft and loud sections pretty extreme. The solo section beginning around the 8 minute mark is one of the few times where the band really lets loose on this release and they ride it out to the end of the track. Lyrically, this song chronicles the early stage of the main character's life and H's interactions with her sister J.

The title track follows and is the most easily loveable song on the disc; it's immediately appealing with its sing-along melody and catchy chorus. This is certainly the most radio friendly song on the release. Lyrically it alludes to the main character's ""break-up"" with her boyfriend and provides a lot of insight into how she views relationships in general.

""Perfect Life"" is a mix of narration during the first half and Wilson repeating the chorus over top of some electronic beats and keys. Lyrically it's a reverie of sorts about H's relationship with her sister - sadly one of the only meaningful relationships in her life.

""Routine"" is another epic song that begins with a haunting piano and vocal melody. The soft guitar noodling the main melody around the 4 and a half minute mark is a highlight followed by ethereal female vocals (Ninet Tayeb). This song, which has a definite Pink Floyd vibe, is probably the most beautiful song on the record from a melody and composition standpoint. It's not really a song about the main character but instead one of the ""victims"" H reads about in her news stories.

The intensity really gets ratcheted up a notch with ""Home Invasion"" - a song about the internet's negative impact on our lives - and the follow up instrumental ""Regret #9"" with its incredible guitar solo. This song really showcases the kind of talent Wilson has recruited to realize and execute his musical dreams.

""Transience"" serves as another retrospective type song from H's youth and serves somewhat as a transition to ""Ancestral,"" the most epic track here. Very cool how the song builds in intensity throughout, culminating in an ominous sounding finale. Once again, this song features the band. Lyrically, this is definitely the most challenging song on the recording to comprehend and remains open to interpretation like most of Wilson's work.

""Happy Returns"" - the most appropriately titled song here - features a letter to H's estranged brother ...almost a ""goodbye/farewell I have no regrets"" type letter. The peaceful album closer serves essentially as a bookend. Once again, the final outcome is open to interpretation. (But X-files fans might not think so!)

Disc 2/The Demos
There is a key piece missing from the main story - ""Key of Skeleton"" - and it is musically found on the demo CD. The book also describes this in some detail as well. The other songs here are different/mostly longer versions of the final cuts but different enough to make this demo CD much more relevant than the demo CD from the Raven sessions. As with all things Wilson, don't think demo quality - these songs sound just as amazing as the stereo versions on the main CD.

Disc 3/The DVD
For those who buy the media book with the DVD-V, you get the DTS 5.1 mix and the 24/96 stereo versions of the songs, the photo gallery and the documentary. Most of the photos in the artbook show up on DVD while the songs are playing in sequence. However, neither the Blu-ray or the DVD contains the ""artifacts.""

Disc 4/The Blu-ray
Here is the disc for the audiophiles. This one contains the 5.1 master DTS, and the stereo 2.0 and 5.1 mixes. Words won't be able to describe how these songs sound in surround but a better listening experience will be hard to find. The fact that these version contain very little compression means that you can crank this stuff up to the highest volume with no distortion. Every voice can be heard in detail and it truly is one of the best recordings I've ever heard. In addition to these hi-def versions of the main CD music, the Blu-ray contains instrumental versions (all of the songs) and alternate versions of some of the songs. For me, the Grand Union version of ""Perfect Life"" - where the spoken word is more clearly discernable - is a highlight, along with the alternate version of ""Regret #9."" A new item (not present on the Raven Blu-ray) would be the piano themes from the release. This is a particularly stunning inclusion from my standpoint as the emphasis on piano and keys on this release was one of the first things I noticed with initial spins that really set this release apart. Of course, the documentary and photo gallery from the DVD are included on the Blu-ray as well. It should be noted that during playback of the DVD/Blu-ray discs, the photos and art from the book - those which correspond to the songs - are displayed. In essence, you can literally watch the video/look at the book and the items therein and listen to the music all at the same time. For music/art/story lovers this project is a dream. The fact that Wilson knows how to make it all connect on an emotional level is merely the icing on the cake!

I've yet to hear the vinyl version but I'm sure it won't disappoint. In summary, Hand Cannot Erase is an unrivaled emotional, listening and visual experience - eclipsing even the brilliance that was The Raven That Refused to Sing. Surely this will be enjoyed for years to come. Thanks to Wilson and friends for their commitment to art at its highest level.",1426550400,8,9885,4.8408284023668635
